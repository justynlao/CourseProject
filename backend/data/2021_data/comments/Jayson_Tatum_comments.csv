"&gt; Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
"Right?!?!   I mean, who would've thought Jayson Tatum would become a shill, peddling the Covid hoax on behalf of the Illuminati &amp; Bill Gates!  No wonder a ""truther"" like Kyrie wanted out of that Org. The ""Deep State"" tentacles are sooo much farther reaching than I ever imagined!!!  Immediate Edit: /s. Cuz, well, this is r/NBA. So better safe than sorry."
"Well to be fair..they traded for Kyrie and then he leaves to join the Nets, pretty much sucks.   Then they sign Kemba and have Hayward back and then no one saw Hayward declining a $30 million PO to sign with another team.   Then Kemba gets injured, now he's just ok for them but a bad contract overall.   They completely failed last off season, didn't manage to sign anyone to fix their team. Not getting Myles Turner is looking like a total mistake. Just tons of little things added up. It's really questionable what they do in the next off-season to fix their issues, Fournier is just ok for them, it would be a miracle for them trade Kemba. Boston is of course in a much better position than at least 90% of the league just because they have Jayson Tatum who is one of the most valuable young superstars in the league. Jaylen Brown helps too. All Boston needs is to figure out their center problem big time and they'll look so much better, plug the hole that Hayward left behind too."
"Yeah, +8% TS is huge. That's like the difference in efficiency between Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum."
"The last Game of Zones where Kyrie gets thrown in NBA jail for burning down the media and they cut to Hinkie chained in the corner is so hilarious lol  ""I've burned down a few things in my day.... The only thing that sustains me is knowing that somewhere, beyond those bars, Embiid, Simmons, and I assume Jayson Tatum are now a dynasty. Tell me, how many championships have we won?"""

"????  The argument for getting it is mainly ENSURING you never have the risk of getting DEEPLY affected by it. Vaccines have 100% prevention of hospitalization/critical affectation from covid/death from covid. Vaccines also minimilze the chances of you being a superspreader. At most, the virus can stay in your nasal/oral cavities but not stay inside your whole body.   The side effects are overblown by dumbass media and people who don't even know basic math. Out of the tens or hundreds of millions that took Astrezeneca, fewer than 20 people got blood clots. That's 99.99% safety  Birth control pills have a higher risk of blood clots. Your typical over the counter pills for different basic flus or viruses have the same possible adverse effects. 99.99% is literally the best rating for any medicine ever because no shit goes 100%  LeBron really got Lakers fans believing in being anti-vaxx more than science.   You are more likely to get covid than have the worst side effects of the vaccine. You are more likely to die from covid than die from the vaccine's rare adverse side effects.   &gt;If you’re healthy and don’t have a risk of dying from the virus, what is the argument for getting a shot for it?  Where did you even find proof of what you're saying? No one is immune from the virus. A world class athlete like Jayson Tatum is still struggling with MODERATE affectation months after getting it. He's easily in the top .0001% of healthy people. That's a moderate case, imagine if anyone gets a severe case of covid."
Damian Lillard/Jayson Tatum/Jimmy Butler. If you're better than them congrats you're **zero** doubt a superstar. If you're not better than them you're not a superstar.
"Some orgs don't have an all-time team that goes that deep, realistically. That said, obviously mine does, so let's give it a shot:  PG: Bob Cousy / JoJo White  SG: John Havlicek / Sam Jones  SF: Larry Bird / Paul Pierce / Jayson Tatum  PF: Kevin Garnett / Kevin McHale  C: Bill Russell / Dave Cowens / Robert Parish  With respect to Rondo, Bill Sharman, DJ, and Tommy Heinsohn, I think that's the list. Maybe I'm stretching a bit by putting Tatum on there, but hey, he could climb a lot higher than 12th on this list in the next few years."
i feel like he’s just to a great fit with jayson tatum and jaylen brown. they need a pure playmaker on that squad and kemba isn’t that
Jayson Tatum please
"I don't know dude, pretty sure if you haven't won by 23 your basically never going to win. Its clear based on all the reactions hot takes on this sub reddit that every team should win championships by the time players hit their mid 20s or else.they are busts. Look at the last 5 or 6 championship teams. They where lead by legendary young players like Kyle Kuzma, and Og Anunoby. Guys like matthew dellavedova and nick young. Guys like Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Zion williamson, Devin Booker, are over the hump has beens that missed their chance to compete in this league"
"Quite a fucking lot, honestly. We've got a lot of young talent and it's fucking perplexing to me that people are like ""UMMMmmMm the 22 and 24 year old aren't NBA champions yet???""  Literally just google this shit. We were 1st in the East the season we drafted Jayson Tatum. As in the Jayson Tatum who is pretty clearly the best player from his draft class.   And we trade back from the #1 pick to get him!"

"Nothing. Just a couple of scrubs called Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kyrie Irving."
"Yep, so the Nets traded the following picks:          - 2014 1st round draft pick.   - 2016 1st round draft pick (Jaylen Brown was later selected),    - a 2017 1st round draft pick (this was traded for the Philly's 2017 1st on draft day with the Fultz pick trade and was used on Jayson Tatum).  -  a 2018 1st round draft pick (was used in the Kyrie trade)"
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.
What a dumb post. They have Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. They're in a far better position than most teams.

"I would honestly rather get the 8 seed and fuck around with Philly or lose out the rest of the way than end up with the 7 and have to deal with a healthy Nets team.

"Protections vary depending on the terms of the trade, and they're evaluated after the lottery takes place. [This massive page](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed) can help you figure out the details of specific picks.   If you scroll down to Houston and look at the first item in the outgoing column, the situation for the pick in question is there.  &gt;  **2021 first round draft pick to Oklahoma City (swap, less favorable of Oklahoma City or Miami incoming)** Oklahoma City will receive the two most favorable of its 2021 1st round pick, Miami's 2021 1st round pick and Houston's 2021 1st round pick protected for selections 1-4 and Houston will receive the least favorable of the three (via Miami to Phoenix to Philadelphia to L.A. Clippers to Oklahoma City; via Oklahoma City's right to swap Oklahoma City or Miami for Houston); **if the Houston pick falls within its protected range and is therefore not conveyable, then Houston's obligation to Oklahoma City will be extinguished** and Oklahoma City will instead receive its pick and the Miami pick [Miami-New Orleans-Phoenix, 2/19/2015; Philadelphia-Phoenix, 6/21/2018; L.A. Clippers-Philadelphia, 2/6/2019; L.A. Clippers-Oklahoma City, 7/10/2019; Houston-Oklahoma City, 7/16/2019]; Houston may convey this pick to Brooklyn in 2021 (see Houston Incoming)  So if they do get pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the lottery, they don't have to give OKC anything in return. There's only a 52.1% chance of that happening.  That's not always the norm. A lot of trades will have some sort of caveat where if a protected pick doesn't convey one year, then the next year's pick is owed (sometimes with looser protections). But pick swaps (which I think this is) seem to be options that apply only to a single year at a time.   Random history example: The Kings once traded away a 1st round pick that was protected top 14 the first year, top 13 the next, then top 12, then top 10 for the next 3 years, and then became a 2nd round pick after they failed so many years in a row to win enough games to convey the pick. That final year, the Kings pick that they kept jumped in the lottery to #3 and swapped with Philly down to #5 due to a different trade. Philly traded the #3 pick to Boston to get #1 and draft Markelle Fultz. Boston used the #3 pick on Jayson Tatum. The Kings used the #5 pick on DeAaron Fox. The second round pick conveyed instead went to Chicago, who eventually sold it to the Warriors, who drafted Jordan Bell with it."
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown.  Fight me Celtics fans"
"I think the ""Wins Added"" on that page would be more valuable than the LEBRON stat. LEBRON is a rate stat and Wins Added is a counting stat. LEBRON doesn't care about how many games you missed, only how good you were while on the court. A player who plays 72 games at a high level should be ranked above a player who plays at a slightly higher level but only for 50 games.  (And no, I'm not saying this just because it puts Jayson Tatum over LeBron.)  Realistically it would be some kind of fusion between the two. Voters typically allow a buffer of games missed before it actually ends of affecting candidacy."
"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.   That roster will be a conundrum for people in the future  &gt;Kyrie Irving &gt;Jaylen Brown &gt;Jayson Tatum &gt;Gordon Hayward  &gt;Al Horford  That’s just insane considering the role players like Marcus Smart, Aaron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris. They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it’s hard to forecast the future.  Can’t believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
"I live in New York. Prior to this year, there was really nothing to be happy about in terms of basketball. No stars and mediocre lottery picks.   I had just got into basketball a few years ago, and saw the Celtics made it to the eastern conference finals. They fought really well against Bron without their best player. Believe Scary Terry and Jayson Tatum are amazing. They have a history of greatness (unlike the knicks) and have some of the greatest players and teams of all time, including Bird and Russell. I start to appreciate every player currently on the team. Love smarts defense and brown’s potential. Skip a few years, bad season but bright future."
Jayson Tatum

Underrated picks:  CJ McCollum Paul George Jayson Tatum
"My first comment was literally ""26 is prime dude"" but yeah I get what your saying, and skill does only tend to increase with age unlike athleticism so it may be that skill prime starts around 28.  Either way most good players have it figured out by their 4th or 5th year in the league and that usually corresponds with being around 25.  Look at jayson tatum, dude is already a baller and he's only 22 in his 4th year in the league."
Salty Celtics fans are punching the air. The Celtics are overrated as fuck and Jayson Tatum is the most overrated player of this generation. Nets in 4.
"I believe he meant to say sit* Tatum. If he could shit out Jayson Tatum’s, that would be really impressive tho. And weird"
"Wade &gt; Harden  Magic &gt; Curry  Paul &gt; Nash &gt; Kidd  Kawhi &gt; Melo  ""Larry Bird or Jayson Tatum"" lmfao  KG &gt; Giannis (for now)  Gobert &gt; Eaton"
I struggle to make a case for Jayson Tatum over Zion
I was saying bam blocked jayson Tatum... but go off.
Jayson Tatum?
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/nesn.com/2021/04/espns-top-under-25-nba-list-has-jayson-tatum-behind-lamelo-ball/amp/  Outside of bridges, Zo who here is RJ Barrett better than? Especially given that the list is missing garland and some other guys."
&gt;The only common denominator between both teams is Stevens   Well Actually the common denominators are the Jays. I think that they both should be traded this off season for the way the team has underperformed. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for Ty Jerome and Al Horford who says no?
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"What the hell you just ignored everything he said. He literally says MJ could score 40 and give an explanation as to why that won’t matter. It’s not even about agreeing or disagreeing here, it’s just you can’t say anything other than “go off dude.” This reminds me of another user that replied to someone who gave an amazing explanation as to why Jayson Tatum was playing great last year and his response was “sir this is a Wendy’s.” No it’s a sub about the nba, and it’s users like you who’re driving the quality of discussion more and more down everyday. I mean this sub has never been amazing to begin with but it can surely be better than “but go off dude.”"
The pairing of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown won't work.
"I think it's more just a downstream effect Embiid taking up a bunch of F votes might affect the candidates at the F spots. But yeah it's not a big deal  I do think if we are letting Embiid be counted as an F we should really just do away with positional designations at this point for good. Outside of the true Cs everything else is interchangeable. Even guards like Kyle Lowry will spend playoff series guarding Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, technically they are playing a ""forward"" spot defensively those times. Doncic counts as a G, Ben Simmons counts as a G but LeBron has to count as an F, it's all just arbitrary as hell."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
Well then make it the top 15 players and eliminate positions. Jayson Tatum is in there as a guard as well. They are trying to get everyone in there but if you are the second best center in the league you should be a second team all star.
So is Jayson Tatum a big man?
"It’s always weird when someone does this, like they say wrong thing after wrong thing after wrong thing and then they’re backed into a “wrong” corner so they stop making arguments and start making cringe jokes it’s just weird. Also who abbreviates it “pds”? Your comment gave me depression.  Next time just say “yeah it was absolutely baby brained of me to suggest that Isaiah Thomas was better than Jayson Tatum, absolutely concave brain, Steven A. Smith-level take”."
I think too much is expected of Jaylen as a compliment to Jayson. Tatum is a singular star.
"We literally won 2 series' we weren't supposed to in 2018 and almost stole the Cavs series too. Literally 5 minutes away from the finals. You can be revisionist all you want but this is very well documented. Even Zach Lowe said the Bucks almost tanked to get the Celtics matchup and Reddick on his own podcast asked Jayson Tatum about it. Go look up any talking heads, Reddit posts from before any of the series'."

Jayson Tatum
"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
"If 3 conference finals in the last 4 years is wasting Jaylen Brown and 2 in the last 3 years is wasting Jayson Tatum, I don't know what the fuck your expectations are. 1/30 teams win a title everywhere. The obvious move would be to exchange Kemba out for a different guard."
Jayson Tatum is overrated that’s why
"I'll have you know that Jayson Tatum Sr. started one game at SG this year, so his eligibility at both spots is clearly justified"
The Kevin Durant was just an example. Like I said it’s a difficult job I’m 100% sure but also like I said. It’s the job they signed up to do. Missed calls happen of course I’m not saying they should never happen. People are human. But the difference between your friends and nba level refs is nba level refs have so much technology on their side that can show they were wrong and yet they will still make the wrong call and when it comes out in the L2M report they still do not have to answer for it. And there’s literally no excuse for guys like Jayson Tatum or JJ redick getting Ts or even ejected (this year) for bouncing a ball or passing a ball too hard at a ref.
"I mean you can literally see how Melo has influenced Randle's game. He's also trained Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Cole Anthony, and so many others."
"The difference between our teams is that our guys that stepped up as starters totally sucked. Reddish and Gallo vs Semi and Grant, etc.   Jaylen has taken another leap since last year, pushing all of his counting stats up without dropping efficiency. Tatum has been on an absolute fucking tear since he said he feels fully back from Covid.   I'm not trying to hate either, I really like the Hawks. They remind me of the Celtics during the Kyrie years in terms of having a lot of really solid players, but maybe not quite a ""trusted 5"". I just think there's a decent gap between Jaylen/Jayson/Kemba and Trae/Bogi/Capela or Hunter."
"The Heat. Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum feels way more scary to face when hot."

"I mean, I hear you loud and clear and all. But have you ever considered Jayson Tatum?"
Jayson Tatum.
Why are we wasting our time with Jayson Tatum when we have Tacko Fall
Was this the account that tweeted out that Ben Simmons had a higher career high than Jayson Tatum then Tatum dropped 2 50 bombs or am I thinking of someone else
Jayson Tatum? You mean the football player?
Jayson Tatum is good at basketball
"Feel bad he got hurt but yeah, Boston plays so much better without Jaylen Brown. Evan Fournier is 10 times better alongside Jayson Tatum.  It would be in everyone's best interest to move on. I've said this before but Ainge blew it by not trading Brown for Harden. Now he has to sell Brown at a loss."
Jayson Tatum for saving Brad Stevens ass from being fired every game
"PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit is launching the first TV campaign for its Ruffles brand of ridged potato chips in almost a decade, while extending its marketing partnerships with star basketball players. The ""Own Your Ridges"" campaign includes two commercials starring Anthony Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers all-star who began his partnership with Ruffles last year, per an announcement.  Davis appears in the two commercials offering a comic take on questions like, ""What would Ruffles be like without their ridges?"" to showcase what makes the potato chips distinct. The first commercial will air during the NBA All-Star Game on TNT on March 7, and the second will run during the Grammy Awards on CBS on March 14. Ruffles also announced a partnership with Boston Celtics all-star Jayson Tatum on the release of Ruffles Flamin' Hot BBQ, a flavor inspired by the spicy cuisine in his hometown of St. Louis.  To expand the campaign beyond TV, Ruffles launched a ""Ridge Awards"" campaign on social media that asks people to ""recognize the people in their lives who have a lot of flavor."" Ruffles on March 14 will release a custom augmented reality (AR) filter on Instagram the lets its followers hold up a virtual ""Ridge Award,"" per the announcement."
Imagine thinking paul george is better than jayson tatum. You're just salty you could have had him instead of markelle fultz
RUFFLES FLAMIN HOT BBQ COOKED UP IN THE MIND OF 19 YEAR OLD EMBRYO JAYSON TATUM?
&gt;He's not at risk lol  Jayson Tatum and Evan Fournier have entered the chat
Idk the one with Jayson Tatum wasn’t bad 🤷🏼‍♂️
Not in a order: Steph curry Bradley beal Nikola jokic Joel embiid Damian lillard Luka doncic Zach lavine Giannis antetokounmpo Zion williamson Trae young Jayson tatum Kyrie erving Idk
He averages 1.1 FTS per game he should be better than that. Jayson Tatum averages 5.3 FTS a game and is shooting it at 87%.
Where was the same energy for the Jayson Tatum ama?
"Did the clowns come out for Jayson Tatum? Because by my count ""his"" post had more mentions of ruffles."
No one cares about Jayson Ter- oh you said Tatum
That is rich coming from a Celtic fan whose team has Jayson Tatum who did the same for Ruffles just recently.
"AD isn't top 10 in this league. Also, it's a sponsorship thing trying to get me to buy more chips.  I'm already buying several bags of Ruffles a week with Jayson Tatum on them just to go with my sub with bacon on it."
Yeah it was really me - Jayson Tatum
This is Jayson Tatum. LETS GOOOOO
"The Horace one was good because it wasn't sponsored, you can tell the answers aren't super carefully chosen. Jayson Tatum with the Ruffles was completely generic so people are going to expect this one to be as well because it's sponsored"
I love that when they did this with Jayson Tatum the questions where so respectful and here everyone is just trolling AD lmao
"But what I said applies to the Jayson Tatum AMA too, who was also doing it because of Ruffles. And his AMA was WAY better than this one because there were a far fewer troll questions. The only question people were mad that he was avoiding was the “how did it feel to dunk on Lebron” question... which he already answered in a Reddit AMA 2 years prior.   &gt;why not have a little fun  Because it went way past having a little fun and more towards people going through all of his replies and crying about AD’s team not taking the bait, and then being salty and calling him names when the AMA ended."
This AMA is 10x worse than the Jayson Tatum one last week
"I mean, Jayson Tatum did one just the other day?"
"You guys both have more karma than Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, and a bunch of other nba players put together all sharing the account /u/nba."
The Jayson Tatum one was pretty good
There was one of these AMAs for jayson tatum and he didn't answer a single question when I checked the thread like an hour after it was posted so I just figured he wasn't going to do it anymore.   They were more respectful but I don't know if he ever ended up answering questions or not.
Would you like a cookie for Jayson Tatum?
"In the month of April, Jayson Tatum was 30/9/5 on .620 TS%, with a 50 point and 60 point game and the Celtics went 11-4 in games he played but aight."
"Hey I went to that school. Jayson Tatum and I did a group project once. We spent 17 days working on it, and it was about what we wanted to do when we grew up. Jayson gave a pretty good speech about how he’s going to grow up one day and become an NBA player. He talked about how he was going to choke against the Bucks and have the refs carry him against the Raptors."
"For those who, like me, wanted to see this also in comments, here's the point breakdown:   Mike Conley with 27 points in the final round.  Jayson Tatum with 17 points in the final round.  Steph Curry with 28 points in the final round"
Idk... he did a great acting job of falling over to his knees defending Jayson Tatum on the final shot of the game to lose us the game then. He is looking really bad. Pistons play much better without him (not saying much I know) not sure why anybody is after him now.
"Guys like Mitchell, Zach Lavine, Jayson Tatum really are still miles away from the superstar group, when you put them together like this it’s so obvious."
"Simmons is sexy but other fans think hes too cocky when he walks n stuff which i can get . Oubre obviously, jayson tatum is ugly as shit? No offense lol."
And Jayson Tatum had front row seats.
Jayson “Yea I’m Playing Defense “ Tatum
Jayson Tatum is shook folks.
"If there were a contest where you had five seconds to shoot a contested 18 footer with your teammates spaced out and waving for the ball, Jayson Tatum would win every year."
When I think of the best 3Pt shooters in the league  Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are definitely players that come to mind   /s😂
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
Zion. Not really anybody similar to him. Can get a jayson Tatum every couple of years.
"this hurts me because Jayson Tatum is my large, adult son but Zion is something different, man.  Also considering that Zion has 2 years of rookie scale still coming &amp; Tatum will be into his super-max extension next year that would make it much easier to build around Zion."
"Which of Jaylen and Jayson would Grant be in front of?  Also, grant is listed at 6’8 210, literally the exact same as Tatum, so of course Ainge would want him ."
"You can’t stop them, but the Celtics have a bunch of guys who can score the ball too. I obviously don’t favour the Celtics in this series but I think they’d do better than a lot of other teams. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are elite defenders and Boston is a great defensive team overall."
"I’m so envious of your playoff success, I’d do anything to be down 1-8 to Jayson Tatum in the playoffs bums 😂😂😂😂"
Jayson Tatum
"Yeah even Tatum said:  &gt;	[“I ain’t gon’ say no names but there was some people on the other team, I’m like ‘hold on, he don’t normally play like that.’ Like ‘he acting different in the bubble.'”](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/jayson-tatum-skeptical-of-players-who-overachieved-in-bubble/)   But a lot of the players that outperformed in the bubble are still playing well."
Jayson Tatum?😂
"Jayson ""Myles Garrett"" Tatum."
"Right? Can’t stay healthy? He got COVID ... look at Jayson Tatum, Seth Curry etc ... these guys got fucking hit hard! I expect it to be another week or two before Jrue looks like himself again"
&gt;“Danny Ainge sucks at drafting.”  Danny Ainge drafting Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in consecutive years doesn't get talked about enough. Sure they're both top 3 picks but how many gms hit one top 3 pick ever let alone 2 in back to back years?
tatum and lob williams are like the same height rob's gotta teach jayson how to jump
"jayson ""the settler"" tatum in his bag tonight"
Payton Pritchard the rookie is older than Jayson Tatum.
Jayson tatum is nasty
That Jayson Tatum is not 19.

Jayson “hero ball” Tatum
Jayson Tatum
"I'm 12 years old and call Jayson Tatum ""kid""."
I think Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum or the right  combo of still being young but already being good enough to not worry about future potential. I’ll take a 100% chance at perennial all stars with some MVP potential over a guy who might have more MVP potential but could also not even reach their level currently.
I agree. Jayson Tatum had a disappointing sophomore year. He made it out okay. Ja will absolutely be fine eventually.
"I'll give you my side. This is going to be long, so buckle the fuckle up.  Brown and Tatum can be the best players on a championship-winning team.  However, they can't be the *only* players on a championship-winning team.  Smart is a good player, who is actually a bad player, because he thinks he's *a lot* better than he is. He takes shots away from Tatum and Brown in big playoff moments, and it costs us dearly each time. Smart thinks he's Steph, meanwhile when the game is hanging on a thread in the last few minutes/seconds, Smart will lay brick after clanging brick, thinking just *maybe* they'll start going in after the *next* one.   *Narrator voice:*  They don't.  Kemba was, in theory, a fantastic signing! But his knee turned into shredded fucking wheat, the *moment* he landed at Logan. It's unbelievable.  Ainge doesn't like centers. He either drafts, or finds in the bargain bin, bench-quality 6' 8"" guys, and throws them out there against the fucking Embiids and ADs of the world, and goes all Surprised Pikachu when they get utterly destroyed. And then they leave, and he trolls the bargain bin for two more 6' 8"" guys the next year.  And the bench? It's a college team. Go on r/bostonceltics. and they'll try to convince you that Carsen Edwards just needs three years to develop, and Robert Williams is really *such a great center, really!*, and Grant Williams is such a great... center, I guess. They tried to convince me the same about James Young. You're a Miami fan, tell me -- have *you* ever heard of James Young?  Can Ainge construct a roster? I mean, *yes.* He put together one of the most insanely stacked teams in '08. And during the Doc Rivers era, he kept it pretty legit the entire time.  But since then? Ainge has absolutely *wanked away* all his draft picks, choosing to take those picks, rather than package them for real players.  There's a very vocal segment of Celtics fandom that reminds me of the cartoon with the dog in the burning house. ""This is fine!"".  No, no it's not. Don't keep telling me how much time we have to develop new draftees each year, because Tatum and Brown are still so young. Guess what? Paul Pierce was young too. Right up until he wasn't, and you look back and realize his prime was wasted on shitty Celtics teams for *years*, until Ainge put his nuts on the table, and traded Al Jefferson, and several others for KG.  This is where we are. Ainge needs to put his nuts back on the table, and fucking *clear* this roster of everyone not named Jaylen or Jayson. Or maybe even one of them, if it can get you the right return. Sometimes you need to give up someone you like, to get someone better. You should have heard the Celtics fandom bitching and moaning when we traded for KG. Everyone liked Al Jefferson. He was a really good player! But trading him allowed us to make *real* moves to get better. But damn, in the moment, you'd think Ainge had run afoul of the Geneva Convention.  Switching from one really-good point guard to the next every two years, and signing cheap 6' 8"" ""centers"", and relying on college kids as a bench you expect to contend for titles... all of that shit is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  If you couldn't tell, it pisses me off."
"Ben Simmons and Jayson Tatum would be such a great complimentary combo together. Thanks, Bryan."
"Ben Simmons is a better player to build around than Jayson Tatum, I will die on this hill."
"Nah, Jayson Tatum is finally old enough to win it this year."
"Conveniently cutting off at 2019.   If you go to years prior you could see he got Smart, Rozier, Brown, Tatum, and Rob Williams In consecutive years.   Also Nesmith, Pritchard and Langford have all played less than 40 games. Those guys make up half of the 6 picks you mentioned and you’re acting as if they’re already wastes.   And they traded 2 of the other picks (Thybulle, Bane) so Ainge didn’t actually make those selections. They were made for the purposes of the trades (clearing cap for Kemba first, and opening a 5.2 million dollar trade exception 2nd).   Last point I’ll make is any other GM in 2016 and 2017 ends up with Kris Dunn and Markelle Fultz. Ainge drafted two all stars in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and ended up with a future pick he used on Langford who, again, the jury is still out on."
"I’ve seen a couple people on this post with the same definition of superstar as me, which is if you can be the best player on a championship caliber team. I would definitely put Dame in that category because last season he proved he was capable of doing that. Embiid and Jokic are like right on the line of being a superstar and being a star, so that’s why I didn’t mention them because it’s really hard to decide. The best player who’s clearly a star but not quite superstar is Jayson Tatum IMO."
Best player that’s a star and not a superstar (yet) is Jayson Tatum
PG: Devin Booker   SG: Jaylen Brown   SF: Jayson Tatum   PF: Domantas Sabonis    C: Bam Adebayo
Kyrie Irving   Jaylen Brown   Jayson Tatum  Gordon Hayward  Al Horford
"The Celtics have unquestionably regressed since last year. They lost Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker is a shell of his former self.  You probably wouldn't beat the Raptors in a 7 game series starting today, and I would favor the Raps in a few months time.  It's good to have a player as great as Jayson Tatum but the Celtics aren't really going in the right direction anymore. If I had told you that this would be the current roster around 2017, would you be happy with that?"
They should start Tremont Waters at the 3 over Jayson Tatum by the same logic.
The Celtics have 4thQuarter offense? I thought they just had Jayson Tatum and called it good.
"&gt; Charlotte, Chicago, New York, Atlanta and Cleveland have all looked good at times this season.  None of those teams has a player as good as Jayson Tatum.   &gt; And when I consider the current state of the Nets, 76ers, Heat, Raptors and the Bucks, I think that the ""at worst"" is a whole lot worse than a top 4 team in the East.  Nets, Sixers, Bucks yes. Raptors no, we beat them last year and again, they lack the true top end talent. Heat are bizarre, no idea what to really make of them as Jimmy is clearly very good, but he's also on the older side, and it's not unreasonable to expect that Tatum will be better than him going forward."
"The Celtics don’t have a true leader. Everyone is a B+ basketball player, but until they have someone who’s able to direct and command the entire team on-court then they’ll never move forward.   Jayson Tatum is good, but he’s still young mentally and makes mistakes in clutch time."
"Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart and Kemba are all the future GOAT or Ainge can't construct a roster? Which is it? You can't have it both ways.  According to Celtics fans your players are both simultaneously the best in the league and the roster isn't good enough and it's all Ainge's fault."
"Hard disagree. Jayson Tatum is 22. We lost a lot of talent value-wise with Kyrie walking out the door and being replaced by Kemba, whose injuries have seriously hurt the team (plus Marcus Smart being injured). Give Ainge the offseason to reset the team. If that fails, then maybe you can begin to consider a coaching change. You don't fire a coach that's taken you to the final 4 with a young roster 3 of the last 4 years"
"yep... or he traded the good picks that he had for nothing. last year he did it with matisse and this year with bane, both players that could have helped them right away.  he hoarded all those picks from one of the worst trades in nba history and he has nothing other than jaylen brown and jayson tatum, who are both great players but they need a better support cast."
"Don’t forget Jaylen brown, Jayson Tatum as well"
"Because wings are more valuable than centers and he outplayed Embiid in the playoffs multiple times already. It's not as ridiculous as you think. Sure Embiid is more ""generational"" but he hasn't backed up his shit more than Tatum has. Go ahead and kick JaYson down while he currently has the worst roster in his tenure. 8-1 is still the number that matters."
"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
"Alright cool, so how about your boy Jayson Tatum? He's shooting below league average TS%. Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?"
"You're a Nets fan who spends most of their time complaining about the Celtics.   Not really a great position to talk about salt.   &gt;Jayson Tatum is not an all-star. I mea 54% TS, negative net rating and mediocre defense doesn’t exactly signal All Star.  &gt; Harris deserves it over Tatum or Brown  &gt; Mostly salty Boston fans  &gt; Um no Bird is not ahead of KD  &gt;No they haven’t been as good as Tobias Harris or Ben Simmons. Tatum has league average offensive efficiency. Brown 59% is good not all-star level. Defense down for both.  &gt;Boston should trade Kemba Walker, who might be one of the few players with a worse contract, for Blake.  &gt;Yes 56% TS doesn’t scream superstar, it’s about league average.  &gt; Can’t even beat the Wizards  &gt;Maybe just maybe he’s not great yet, I mean 56% TS nothing to write home about  &gt;Remember when people were comparing Kemba to Beal?  &gt;Cs are one loss way from blowing it all up, you can feel it here ..  &gt;Tobias Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kemba Walker which is incredible to think about considering what was being said about Harris’ contract at the beginning of the season.  &gt;etc etc."
"&gt; they have enough  They have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, neither of whom are high enough level ball handlers. Kemba Walker is a shell of his former self. Marcus Smart is out for a while. The rest of the team is very one dimensional and there's like one role player shooter who defences actually respect."
"Jayson Tatum is not an all-star. I mea 54% TS, negative net rating and mediocre defense doesn’t exactly signal All Star."
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
This is coming from a Celtics fan whose Jayson Tatum literally got spoon feed an allstar appearance
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
Hahahahaha fuck jayson tatum
Jimmy butler &gt; Jayson Tatum. And last year proved it.
Jayson Tatum &gt; Jimmy Butler   Jaylen Brown &gt; Bam Adebayo    Checks out
Jayson Tatum is a poor mans trevor ariza
Jayson Tatum woke up feeling dangerous with 13/1/1 in 25% FG 😫🥵🥵🥵
Jayson Tatum woke up feeling dangerous today     🔥
Trae is better than Jayson Tatum  (:
Khris Middleton should replace Jayson Tatum
"Boston fans have to accept the fact that Kyrie was not the issue in 2018/19, nor was Rozier. Notice how neither Horford nor Hayward wanted to stay in Boston despite its ""bright future"". The issue was always that there is a locker room cancer in our core, namely Brad Stevens, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Marcus Smart.  Smart has been out for most of the season, so it can't be him. I have been a vocal proponent of firing Brad Stevens, but we cannot rule out the possibility that Tatum and Brown do not like each other."
See: Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown this season lol
"Fred's 55% TS  The only other Eastern Guard who's around that efficiency is Jayson Tatum at 56%. Then Brown's at 60%. Lavine and Harden are both at 65%. If Fred were on the All-Star team he'd have the emptiest stats out of all of them.   Feels like reducing my argument down to ""People like empty stats"" is an obvious strawman meant to dismiss my argument without actually addressing anything I'd said. I mean, that's exactly what it looks like."
"&gt; Plays like Young's brake-check jumper have created a lot of conversation within the league. But there are so many clever maneuvers players use. Some are so subtle to the point of being nearly unnoticeable, like Kyle Lowry setting up to take a charge and gently pulling the offensive player into him to make it look like he got plowed over. &gt;  &gt; McCutchen has a polite name for these players: innovators. He won't name names, though NBA fans know the prime culprits and the strategies they deploy. &gt;  &gt; ""Innovators, such as some of the players you may be imagining,"" McCutchen said, ""are always going to test the rules."" &gt;  &gt; A good example: The rulebook is clear about two steps after a gather. But what it doesn't say is that the steps have to be forward, backward or sideways. Players such as James Harden, Jayson Tatum and others have, ahem, innovated to take that step-back to extremes.  There's a significant difference between taking advantage of the rules (like the swipe through, before the league changed the rule) and deceiving the ref (Lowry pulling players onto him).  The former is on the league to stop, while the latter is on the refs."
     Giannis (26)  Luka (21) wtf this dudes only 21...  \---  Embiid (26)  Jokic (26)  AD (27)  \---       Players that could age well and keep pace:  Trae Young (22)  Bam Adebayo (23)  Bradley Beal (27)  \---  Zach Lavine (25)  Donovan Mitchell (24)  Sabonis (24)  Jayson Tatum (22)  Jaylen Brown (24)
Yep and Jayson Tatum will be remembered like Larry Bird lmfao
Hahahahahah fuck jayson tatum
"Celtics fans: we are the best team in the East, we deserve 4 all stars even though they all have average stat. [Insert player] has better stat but he's playing for a shit team so it doesn't count.  Also Celtics fans: Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have better stat than [Insert player], so they deserve all stars even though the team is worse. Being a better team doesn't garuentee an all star."
Jayson Tatum
"Who said in the next 2 years? In the next 2 years isn’t impossible though. We have a better duo than the Sixers, they just have better role players. When we had Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown playing we started off the season 8-3. Marcus Smart is the most important player to this team winning. No Marcus Smart, no winning."
Oh! So Brown and Tatum have been bestowed with that meaning that FVV hasn’t been hmmm and the game wasn’t a joke last year when FVV didn’t make it   [I want this one btw](https://www.nike.com/t/jayson-tatum-boston-celtics-city-edition-nba-swingman-jersey-tBpPCT/CN1715-104?nikemt=true&amp;cp=81742485461_search_%7CPRODUCT_GROUP%7CGOOGLE%7C71700000052538341%7CAll_X_X_X_X-Device_X_Nike-FullPrice_X%7C%7Cm&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1prSz9OB7wIVVuHICh3JkwoeEAQYAiABEgIxVPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Pelicans are 1.5 games back despite having the tougher schedule till date and being in the tougher conference.  Most people seem to agree CP3 is the key guy in elevating the team to that record. Spurs are right behind y'all, and they don't have any. The guard spot in the West is packed."
Time for a Jayson Tatum 3.
45% from the field is not a problem what are you talking about.   Jayson Tatum shoots 45%.  Jimmy Butler literally shoots 43%  45% is good.
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
Jayson Tatum has -1 rings?
Jayson Tatum is definitely better than Brown. I don't care what the shooting splits say. That team is completely lost when Jayson Tatum isn't on the floor.
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"the Jayson Tatum before Jayson Tatum, our legendary prospect"
"&gt;He could but he is very adamant in where he wanted to go. And he is also 32 so realistically its 3 years of prime Harden and then we only have Jayson.  3 years is long enough to win a title. Harden, Tatum, Smart, Tucker (can be added in hypothetical trade for Harden) and company makes you frontrunners and hurts the Nets because then *they* don't have him.  Also, if you make the common sense S&amp;T with Indiana like you should've before Hayward had to take the offer from Charlotte, you have Myles Turner for essentially nothing too. The deal woulda likely worked if you just immediately took it; it seemed like Ainge wanted to hold out and try to fleece Indiana for as much as possible  &gt;I don't think he will be an MVP level player but Brownsade big jumps 2 years in a row. An elite defensive wing with a great offensive game that's under team control is a big ask. Considering Nets didn't have to give up nearly as talented of a player as Brown.  He's made a big jump to being an actual all star caliber player this year, but there's no guarantee he'll make another huge jump again. Same with Tatum; they need to become superstar caliber to win with them both as focal points of your franchise.   Otherwise, trade Brown while his value is sky high and you give up not much for a top tier superstar who's playmaking is so damn good he makes all your struggling role players better  Robert Williams instantly becomes an top-tier producer with Harden on his team.   &gt;That's fair but the goal is to build around the Jay's not trade them for older superstars who have other destinations in mind. What's stopping Harden from demanding a trade from us this off-season if he was super committed to being in Brooklyn?  He was committed to Brooklyn, sure, but mainly because they were the best team willing to take risks to win and they made that offer. If you guys made the concerted effort, he'd stay the 2 years and possibly resign"
"They aren't making it this year no matter what.   Their only path to a championship is killing internal player development. That means Jayson Tatum becomes a no-doubt top 10 guy. That means Brown brings himself really close to that top 10 line.   Just as important is internal development for Williams, Nesmith, Langford, Pritchard. If those guys can really improve then maybe you then have the trade capital to move them and say the contract you pickup with the TPE and some picks for the third star. Or maybe they along with that TPE and smart use of exceptions like the tax payer exception is how you get there with really really good depth alongside Brown and Tatum.  They simply do not currently have the value on the books to become a championship team. Somewhere they need to turn their C and B value pieces into B and A value pieces. That could be through brilliant trades, clever FA signings, nailing draft picks or internal development. Internal development seems by far the most likely.   Get a solid starter with the TPE and pray for development."
"Sorry I wasn't clear : Draymond, Giannis, AD as 4's HAVE to provide some rim protection as part of their off ball responsabilities, Draymond can do much more, but part of what he's asked to do is rim protect, which will always make him more valuable then a wing defensively.  If I include bigs, there's no wing/perimeter players on that list. Like yeah Mikal Bridges or Jayson Tatum provide great off ball D for wings, but the value of that is way way way less important than what Draymond provides"
Watching Jayson Tatum play NBA basketball is a joy
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"&gt;If Celtics are serious about contending you make trades like that to have a chance.  The Celtics made exactly the type of trade you're talking about with Kyrie and people clown them because it didn't work out, even though without Kyrie *and* Hayward that team went to game 7 of the ECF against LeBron.   Should the Celtics have traded Jaylen Brown for one year of Kawhi? Jayson Tatum for one year of AD? Because that's what you're advocating for the Celtics to do when you say they should have ""taken a chance"" with those trades."
I thought Josh Jackson would be a lot better than Jayson Tatum
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"u/zakaria20199 gets home from a hard day at work. He hastily opens the door to his room and is greeted by the smiling faces of hundreds of KD fatheads sprawled across his walls. A grin begins to form across his face.  “Aw man KD you don’t know how glad I am to see you.” He climbs into his Brooklyn nets inspired footy pajamas and then under his OKC thunder KD bedspread. He ponders - “Why don’t people like KD and admit he’s a top 10 player of all time? He’s definitely better than that stinkin Larry Bird! Blast! I hate Larry, he would only be a modern day Jayson Tatum or Luka.”  Something washes over u/zakaria20199 and he decides he’s not gonna take it anymore... His eyes wander to his rare hanging classic SuperSonics KD jersey and declares, “Enough is enough! Today is the day that r/nba sees just how good KD really is!” He grabs his laptop, which is strewn with more stickers of KD and logs onto reddit.  He begins writing his plea to the world to finally look past KD’s shortcomings and acknowledge his true greatness as a top 10 player of all time. He begins his declaration as a devilish expression climbs across his face... “Why is KD greatness minimized to “his one of the greatest scorers”  That is my tale"
Caris Lavert is better than Jayson Tatum
"They could have also had Simmons, Embiid and Jayson Tatum. That's the Process Sixers I would have really liked to have seen"
"The 76ers had back-to-back #1 picks, and they wasted them on Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz  In 2016, Simmons was picked ahead of Brandon Ingram (#2) and Jaylen Brown (#3)  In 2017, Fultz was picked ahead of Lonzo Ball (#2) and Jayson Tatum (#3)  Which goes to show how successful the Celtics have been with those two drafts"
Like a Jayson Tatum?
"Who would you rather have, Jayson Tatum or Jeff Teague?"
"They missed out on Jayson Tatum LMAO, can u imagine the Tatum and Embiid duo."
#SIXERS PICKED MARKELLE FULTZ OVER JAYSON TATUM
"First of all, your sentence structure and lack of punctuation is ridiculous.  Second, see Jayson Tatum and Mo Bamba in the NBA. Von Miller and Ryquell Armstead in the NFL. Khamzat Chimaev in MMA. Even a little research will reveal multiple athletes that spoke on how difficult it was for them to recover from COVID. I can personally attest to it too.  No one’s saying they can’t return to full health; we (and they themselves) are saying that it’s difficult."
I know lmao some of the way these dudes talk on reddit makes it sound like players like Jayson Tatum skipping dinner because they can't afford it. If you can't make do on $900k per year (with a lot of free meals/travel costs too probably) then you need to reconsider your lifestyle
"Okay you found one game, which was the 2nd to last game of the year.. where Jayson Tatum played pretty close to what he normally plays in the first half against other teams... and was up 19 points at half.. so Kornet plays more than him.   Not sure this helps your argument."
"First team all-hospital:  CP3, Kyrie, Kawhi, AD, Embiid  Second team all-hospital:  Conley, Murray, Harden, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams  Honorable mentions: Kemba, Cam Reddish, Donte Divincenzo, Jeff Green, Jayson Tatum for like half of game 2"
"There is literally nothing objective about leadership and pretending otherwise is absolutely biased thinking, especially considering none of us fans can see it up close and personal.   Jimmy Butler has the same amount of deep playoff runs as Jayson Tatum, and Tatum was able to do so at a younger age. Booker doesn't have the same reps but he was able to spearhead a massive cultural turnaround starting in the bubble for a team that had been a bottom feeder for almost a decade and he is now in the middle of a deep playoff run while Tatum and Butler are out in the first round.   To poke at Jimmy's record, you talk about his impressive playoff runs but his crowning achievement was a finals run when he wasn't even his team's best player in half of the series (Dragic vs Indiana, Bam vs Boston).   Another nitpick, Boston's biggest problem was not a lack of leadership on the court, it is that the team is incredibly top-heavy and was continuously not healthy.   If you are going to make an argument for Jimmy over Tatum or Booker for all-NBA, you can damn well do so using actual analysis of their production. There is nothing about how you think their leadership is that is objective."
"Jayson Tatum is younger, and in better shape and now has to use an inhaler according to himself."
"People gotta stop calling players by just their initials, I have never heard anyone call Jayson Tatum ""JT"" before"
Interesting. I wonder if you'd like to see jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum split up.. I mean one more big trade and they are in BKN territory in terms of star power are they not??
What the fuck did we say about using initials… never heard jayson Tatum as JT either
"Oof. That’s a bad product, though. Imagine pulling Jayson Tatum in the 4th of a tight game because he is up close to his min restriction for the week or whatever. Heads would absolutely explode."
"I think the numbers give Randle a marginal advantage (including team success, and time played), but I'd want to dive into some film, and look at lineups and all that other shit before I claimed either had a firm advantage over the other.  Like, for instance, I think Tatum stretched defenses more than Randle did over the course of the year. Randle has the statistical profile that would force defenses to stretch once it became clear he was hitting 40%, but Jayson was shooting far more threes off the dribble, and putting up a few more a game. Jayson also had far more unassisted threes than Julius.  Then there's things like screen assists.  I wouldn't be shocked if Randle had the edge, overall, if we could factor those things in well, but I don't have the time or resources to get into that."
Hah. That is really funny. A little technicality cost me $32 million. Oh well!  \-Jayson Tatum
"Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Randle all had worse seasons than Jayson Tatum and Donovan Mitchell not to mention that Tatum literally had more All-NBA votes than Kyrie Irving"
I mean Jayson Tatum has been playing for 3-4 years already and he’s only 19
My comedian in me says Jayson Tatum.
Can game 3 Jayson Tatum be damned?
"I mean, I’m sorry, but it’s just dumb. The runner up for the MVP award isn’t on the first team and Jayson Tatum just lost a $32 million payday because NBA best writers like to pretend they’re little GMs constructing a fake starting five? It’s ridiculous."
Jayson Tatum received no guard points according to this https://www.nba.com/news/nikola-jokic-giannis-antetokounmpo-stephen-curry-lead-2020-21-all-nba-first-team%3famp=1 so definitely disinformation
Jayson Tatum received no guard points according to this https://www.nba.com/news/nikola-jokic-giannis-antetokounmpo-stephen-curry-lead-2020-21-all-nba-first-team%3famp=1 so definitely disinformation
"&gt;With Luka clearly being the most valuable player in the NBA from a Front Office standpoint, who is the second most valuable player in the league?  &gt;A few things matter to this I feel. Age, offensive skill, defensive skill, contract, and that x-factor.  &gt;Candidate wise a few guys come to mind. Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, LeBron James, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell  &gt;Who do you guys think the second most valuable player is in the NBA and if you have the time, why?  &gt;Edit: I forgot Jokic"
"So weird not seeing James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell on the list. And yet, I don't see anything wrong with these choices (other than Jimmy Butler).     This league is way too talented."
Wow Durant is looking like the goat Jayson Tatum out there
"I'd have switched Jimmy and Julius around and had Jayson Tatum in the 3rd team over Paul George.  Other than that, the only real snub would be James Harden, but considering he missed close to half the season I think it's fair Beal got in over him."
Where the actual fuck is Jayson Tatum lmao. This is wild
He was the nominal SG in literally one game this year where half the team was injured and we started Kemba/Jayson/Grant/Theis/Thompson.    The positions this year were absolute horseshit.  Embiid and Jokic are not forwards.  Booker is not a forward.  Tatum is not a guard.
Jayson tatum for me btw
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn’t make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would’ve definitely made it on if he didn’t get injured, maybe he’d have replaced Beal"
"Jayson Tatum over Paul George is the only thing I would DEFINITELY change. Otherwise I think its a great list. I think the toughest spot is the last two guard spots, Bradley Beal + Zach Lavine would've been my pick to be completely honest, but I think it definitely comes down Beal/Irving/Mitchell/Lavine/Booker and even James Harden despite his limited action was incredible."
"All-NBA 4th team:  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Kevin Durant  I guess Russ on the 5th team? Damn, so many good guards"
There is no fucking way in hell that Lebron playing half a fucking season was more deserving than Jayson fucking Tatum.  I’m upset.
"&gt;Interesting twist in the All-NBA voting. Tatum was eligible as a guard and forward and had more votes than Kyrie, who made the third team as a guard. But Tatum was slotted as a forward because that was the position where he received the most votes.  Jayson ""Khris Middleton"" Tatum"
Jimmy B[ubble Player]utler over Jayson Tatum? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yup. This was in 2019 and I can’t even say who the best player was: Donovan Mitchell? Jayson Tatum? Khris Middleton?
"So Boston gives up Jayson Tatum, 1 non-lotto 1st, and a pick swap for KAT, Rubio, and Cade. Dallas gives up KP and a 1st for Kemba and Layman. Minny gives up KAT, Rubio, Cade for KP, Tatum, two firsts, and a swap.   That leaves Boston with Rubio/Jaylen/Cade/KAT/Robert Williams, which isn't a great fit. Maybe they flip Williams for a true PF?   Dallas moves KP and a 1st for a secondary ball handler and a bench player, as well as a shorter shitty max contract  Minny runs DLo, Edwards, Tatum, KP, McDaniels?   This trade isn't *horrible* but I think it could be improved by having Minny send McDaniels to Boston and Boston send Robert Williams to Minny. Boston also needs more in return. Cut their outgoing pick swap (kinda pointless anyway) and don't make them send out a 1st to Minny. Then I think it's potentially a decent trade where each team benefits.   Boston runs Rubio/Jaylen/Cade/McDaniels/KAT, an improvement over their current team.   Dallas gets out from the KP contract by adding a secondary ball handler with a shorter contract, which is desirable to them.   Minny runs DLo, Edwards, Tatum, KP, Timelord. I'm still not sure about this fit but it's not terrible.   Looking at it further, I think Minny is the weak point here. Not sure if DLo/Edwards/Tatum/KP/Timelord plus a Dallas first or DLo/Edwards/Tatum/KP/McDaniels (as in your trade) is better than DLo/Edwards/Cade/McDaniels/KAT. This last one isn't shoehorning anyone into a position they're not, plus it has a good balance of spacing, defense, and shot creation."
Kyle Kuzma is better than Jayson Tatum
"I mean, they've been letting Jayson Tatum play in the league, and Trae is def older."
Jayson Tatum is legit at least 6’9 and I don’t understand why you’re so invested in this height difference
Jayson Tatum is 6’9 minimum bro  Imagine arguing this because that’s all you have left to argue between Book and JT
Brad Stevens came out and said that was a [joke](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/brad-stevens-comes-clean-about-how-jayson-tatum-height-drama-started).  He's still listed as 6'8.  And in 2019 the NBA instilled the rule that team heights had to come accurately from the team's physician.
"I only ever saw people sharing that sentiment crucified because it was often a justification for younger/fitter people engaging in reckless or unsafe behavior with regards to the virus. It was an argument for antivax and covid-deniers, ignoring that no matter how low the risk is for an individual, they will be able to spread COVID to higher risk people who *are* elderly or obese. Not to mention the fact that the original statement isn’t even super correct since even healthy young people (Jayson Tatum?) have been negatively effected in the long term by COVID in ways other than death.  Very few people would react negatively to “being fat or old are big risk factors for COVID,” but if you’re only ever bringing it up to argue about why you should be able to go to Wal-mart without a mask because you aren’t high risk, people will get mad. And that isn’t because they’re taking “body positivity” too far, or because they’re in denial about obesity, it’s because you’re missing the point."
Jayson Tatum is not better than Luka  Booker isn’t better than Tatum
"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha so now we are acting like Tatum did that all alone, damn more evidence of leeway large market stars are given.    By those metrics Jayson Tatum can’t be as good as Donovan Mitchell Bc he isn’t in the playoffs, meanwhile Donovan is averaging 37 ppg being guarded by PG and Kawhi. Do you see how stupid your argument sounds when you reduce players to one selective series or time frame rather than looking at their entire careers and body of work? Get the fuck out of your head and appreciate that both players are incredible young players we get to watch for years to come."
"Got a good one and it’s my own team. The Celtics in 2018 when Hayward and Kyrie were both out (#1 and #2 at the time). Terry Rozier (3rd year), Jaylen Brown (2nd year), Jayson Tatum (rook) and a bunch of role players beat the Sixers, Bucks and were minutes away from making the finals against LeBron, who was still completely unstoppable. Tatum dunked in LeBrons grill and then chest bumped him after. The 2018 playoff Celtics were really an awesome team that I believe would’ve given the warriors a run for their money had they gotten through LeBron."
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
"Brown was the second option and is **levels** better on defense than everyone you named (while being younger than Towns and Beal). He also is making significantly less than everyone in your comment.  When playing as the first option (no Jayson Tatum) Brown averaged 30.5, 3.4, and 6.4 on 50/40/82. Without Jayson Jaylen had a true shooting percentage of 62% which is also much much better than everyone in your list."
watching KD struggle with no help makes you realize even more just how good Jayson Tatum is
Commentator: Jayson Tatum is 19
"I also saw someone say Ja Morant is a top 5 player under 25.... ahead of Jayson Tatum, SGA, and Zion among others."
Jayson Tatum has an extremely high chance of passing Larry Bird of the best Celtics player assuming he gets some help besides 2-4 people
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
Or I could nitpick the guy who’s comparing Jayson Tatum to Larry Bird for no real reason instead of guys from the past with at least somewhat comparable roles like Dantley.   Ask yourself why your go-to for modern comparisons to a borderline 30 PPG scorer was a top 5-10 player of all time and not one of the many others who weren’t anywhere near that good that were doing it in the same era. You might be looking back with some rose-tinted glasses.
If you think that roster compares to the olympic roster I feel sorry for you. Jayson Tatum who was the best player there didn't even play any of the Knockout games. Pretty much any team the US sends sweeps since we actually take the Olympics seriously
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
"Jayson Tatum for sure. Mitchell has proved he’s above that Trae/Shai/Fox/Murray echelon with this playoff run, but I’m still not ready to put him up there with JT just yet"
Introducing the 2021 ROTY - Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will not lead the Celtics to a ring.
Bro lol it’s not a lie it came from [Brad Stevens](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/12/13/according-to-brad-stevens-jayson-tatum-has-grown-and-is-now-6-foot-10/). I literally saw him in person a few weeks ago and he’s the same height as KD standing next to him

"Oh, Mitchell is really good and is making huge strides towards getting that superstar mantel. But there can only be so many superstars. Lebron, Harden, KD, Kawhi, Giannis, Steph, Jokic, Embiid are the only superstars. I honestly don't even consider Dame and AD superstars because according to me there can only be so many ""superstars"" before the word loses meaning. AD, Dame, Jayson Tatum and Mitchell are probably closest to the title"
"As a Celtics fan I would trade Jayson Tatum for him straight up, son there is that..."
"Oh it's far from good, but they did score 15 at least and started to finally fight back. I thought Jayson Tatum was prone to some sloppy Isos...holy shit Giannis"
"Lol yes they are aware hot take artists and newspapers exist.   I may only be 12, me and Jayson Tatum were in first grade together but that’s another story, but even I know that pros try their bestest regardless of what everyone says about them."
Take notes Jayson Tatum and stop looking at the refs after every shot
Bro Jayson Tatum and Jimmy Butler round out the top 15. Mitchell isn’t better than those two
"This is a joke, right?   Tier 1 Jayson Tatum  Tier 2 Manu Ginobili (you spelled his name wrong plus there's an accent on the o)  Tier 3 Everyone else"
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"Jaylen Brown averaged 30.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 7 games without Jayson Tatum this season. He did so on 50.6% from the field, 39.7% from three and 82.9% from the free throw line. #1 Option JB is really good."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
Current : Jayson Tatum  All time : LeBron James but eventually will be Tatum I feel
"Kyrie, Devon Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and either Trae Young or Jayson Tatum even though their resumes are short"
"He did surprisingly well, hes quicker than I thought. Of course he can't stick with like Jayson Tatum but he can put in 15-20 min a game at the 4"
Celtics did get Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum out of that trade though
"It was the night of the lottery and several hours after the fact. He tweeted ""what pick did we get?"" and I sarcastically replied ""#2, we're taking your replacement Ben McLemore so we can trade you"" (Cold Takes Exposed for sure lol. As much as ET stunk, he was in fact better than McLemore.) He quoted tweeted it and said ""Let's hope so!!!"" and promptly deleted it and blocked me.  Literally I probably haven't even thought about it at all since then until the other day when the Celtics fired Brad and I saw Jayson Tatum quote tweeted an Evan Turner tweet and I was confused why I couldn't see it lol completely forgot about it"
"you don't have to tell me, people spent the whole year acting like Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum need to be split up or that Danny Ainge, the GM that won a title, pulled off one of the greatest trades in NBA history that netted the team 2 under 25 All-NBA level talents was Vlade Divac level bad."
Why does the TNT online stream show the same two commercials for Jayson Tatum and Joel Embiid back to back nonstop. I don’t even know what they’re supposed to be selling me
Guys is it true Jayson Tatum is 22 years old
They’re calling Brad Stevens to try and trade for Jayson Tatum /s
"He did keep cap flexibility to take on bad contracts/picks. The Kings traded Carl Landry, Stauskas, their 2017 pick (ended up being the 3rd pick) and the 2019 pick (ended up being the 14th pick).  The problem is that Colangelo traded both those picks for Fultz.  If they keep those picks instead of trading up for Fultz then they have Jayson Tatum on the Sixers as well."
Dude… Jayson Tatum is only 17 years old
...like LeBron played in a tough East? The East LeBron played in post 2013 was maybe the weakest it had been ever. Only the early 2000s compared. LeBron is great but look at his CF opponents from those years. Jeff Teague and Al Horford won 60 games. DeMar and Kyle Lowry and a 21 year old Jayson Tatum were LeBrons biggest roadblocks to the Finals.
"They did play like shit that game but still, Jayson Tatum is the real deal tho"
Jayson Tatum got a deflection against it in game 5 of their series
"yeah, that's why it's impossible to tell right now. Everything hinges on just a couple of those picks becoming good. Brooklyn was only really bad for two years before Marks was able to kinda right the ship, but those two years got Boston Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, essentially setting up their franchise to be at least competitive for the majority of the 2020s.  Also the tank can allow Houston to keep their pick this year. There's a chance that a top 3 pick this year lands them a future star on that level, so that alone is huge for the rebuild, and there's no realistic chance of keeping the pick if Houston kept Harden, or swapped him for a package revolving around a few good players."
Jayson Tatum is probably the closest to him even then KD is taller and longer. Obviously Tatum is much inferior but he was getting KD comparisons in HS.
Jayson Tatum averaged 27/10/5 last year in the playoffs when he led his team to the ECF. After he averted 24 and made an all nba team in the regular season. I’m almost certain you’re 8 years old and a filthy casual now lmaoo
"Nobody in this sub is taking Kyrie over Jayson Tatum.  Beal at his very best defensively was average. And when he was, he wasn’t averaging 30+, Tatums averaging 27 and is a great defender that’s the difference"
This is a such a great point from a developmental standpoint. I feel like Jayson Tatum is a decent example of this. His playmaking got better after he became an offensive assassin.
"Lmao Kyrie, Beal, PG and Gobert are not better than Jayson Tatum at basketball. My god 😂  Casual mfer"
Name 16 players better than Jayson Tatum this will be hilarious
As big a blowout as losing by 50?  Again without Harden lol Jayson Tatum was still cooking the defense
"I think the bucks can make this a series, but man if they get swept and Jayson Tatum and the Celtics were able to get one game off them, It's going to look real bad on top of being already bad.  Tatum did this with The big three. They're playing a big 2."
Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker Trae Young Jayson Tatum
You must not have seen him go up against Jayson Tatum.
"East front court is stacked but I definitely think he makes it.

"Jaylen  brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, Fast PP"
"We lost key personnel since the defensive juggernaut teams. Baynes who reinvigorated his career. Mook who was supposed to be an offensive player developed into a good defender here. Horford is obviously the biggest game changer on those. Our perimeter defense has been trash because Jaylen and Jayson are way too focused trying to help the interior D. You saw it tonight when Jaylen would help, they set up a screen for Steph and Steph is left wide open because absolutely everyone has to prevent the easy 2. Payton was actually a massive boon for our defense. Quick enough to help bother paint offense and gets back to his man the moment he smells the ball handler passing outside. Tatum and PP were out best help defenders, our defensive issues really got exposed the moment 1 of them is even out and now we have Marcus out too"
"Jaylen and Jayson have 2 legit seasons. Peak IT lasted one year. Kyrie called it quits after one. Hayward was always hurt and took forever to rehab from the leg injury only to come back and get minor injuries. Horford was arguably the most productive over the longest period of time for us but his age was showing by the end of that 2nd season.   The timing for Cs has always been fucked post IT  1st season: Sign Hayward and trade for Kyrie, Jaylen, Jayson, Horford and Terry peaking in the playoffs but their out for the rest of the season.   2nd season: Healthy Kyrie next season, Tatum and Jaylen regresses while Hayward was obviously not ready and Mook and Terry on contract years.   3rd season: Signed Kemba to recover from losing Kyrie. Cs looking great. Hayward breaks his hand after running into Aldridge on a blindside screen. Hayward comes back looking good, reinjures his leg  4th season (current): Jaylen and Jayson are tearing it up. Kemba is out. Kemba comes back and looks like ass trying to play his way back. Jayson is out because of Covid. Team is finally all together. Marcus Smart is hurt now.  What can you honestly do? Ainge hasn't hit on the FA market in terms of role players so our bench has been beyond trash since last season. With the amount of injuries we have, its just been a killer."
"lol i like wanamaker; he's a smart dude, but he has zero shot of stopping jayson tatum"
Did you know Jayson Tatum is only 20?
Then you have the Celtics who seem to draft solely based on looks. I’m not embarrassed to say that the C’s have the best dynamic duo based on looks with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
I’m a jayson Tatum fan like most people but he does the same thing ALL the time.  ALWAYS complaining.
The Jaylen Brown pick was the Nets pick that year which we got from trading Paul Pierce and KG to the Nets. We used another Nets pick to draft Jayson Tatum. That pick was from the same trade.
Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic are better than either Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Is that really a hot take?
"Presti has no incentive to make the Clippers better, he owns their draft picks from now until Jayson Tatum turns 20."
"I mean, could we even come to an agreement right now?  I have:  pg: Curry / Luka / Dame / Cp3 / Kyrie  sg: Soften / Beal / Mitchell / Dbook / CJ McCollum  sf: LeBum / Kawhine / Jimmy Butler / Jayson ""6'10"" Tatum / PG13%  pf: Giannis / AD / Sabonis / Siakam / Williamson  c: Jokic / EmbiId / Bayumn Adebayo / KAT / Zhe Baguette Money Man  &amp;#x200B;  and I guarantee there would be a bunch of angry people regarding those rankings."
Conveniently leaves out Kevin Love as well as spark plugs like Jordan Clarkson Rodney Hood and veteran shooters like Kyle Korver and George Hill.  the toughest teams he faced where the pacers who somehow took them to 7 (lol) and Celtics led by rookie jayson tatum. I think KD would do just fine lol
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
"On the plus side, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are unbelievable."
Jayson Tatum shot 34.2  on 4 attempts at Duke
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Ok, so then I can spin this back on you and say that Anthony Davis is only 2 years away from requesting a trade from the Lakers if they don't build an adequate roster around him in the event that LeBron suffers a serious injury and is never the same player anymore.   Do you realize how stupid that sounds?   I don't expect Anthony Davis to leave LA. I don't expect Kawhi Leonard or Paul George to leave LA. You shouldn't expect Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown to leave Boston."
"Its better to build around Ben simmons than Jayson Tatum,"
"He's the ultimate compliment player. Superstars are the MVP votes getters. The main piece that people build around. Steph and KD are superstars. Klay is a compliment to them. Chris Bosh wasn't a superstar. Brad Beal, Mitch Richmond, Tim Hardaway Sr., Kyle Lowry, Middleton, etc. aren't superstars. Klay has always been efficient and plays good enough D to have made all-defense 1 time. He's 2 times all-nba on the 3rd team. That's not a superstar. Jayson Tatum is closer to being a superstar than Klay ever was."
"Also, side note, that Nets team got swept in the first round after having the pandemic happen late season along with no KD or Kyrie. I doubt the Celtics would be making it to the ECF without Jaylon Brown and Jayson Tatum."
I’ve never heard of Jason Tatum. I know of a bright young man named Jayson Tatum tho
"Played an 19 years old Jayson Tatum in the ECF tho, that conference was abysmal that year."
Jayson Tatum
"Not OP but P Willy looks great, he just has something about him that makes it seem like he’s gonna be great. Right now he projects to be a Kawhi/Jayson Tatum type player (obviously probably won’t become that good but that’s a pretty good comp for him)"
"then u have PJ Tucker who is maybe considered a bigger man than Durant is.   Historically you have guys like Charles Barkley and Dennis Rodman who plays the PF. Draymond Green too who are all smaller than Durant. Hell even Jayson Tatum are taller than those guys, it's more about the style of play and reputation I guess. Also tall =! big"
"Jayson ""Kuroko's Basketball"" Tatum"
"Then why did you compare them to Jayson Tatum if you realize they're much older than MJ?  As for the rest, of course MJ was better than them in the 90s. I don't think anyone in this thread has questioned that. However, MJ had rivals for best player throughout his career. Bird and Magic were the faces of the NBA for the first chunk of his career. Magic won two more MVPs after MJ's first. Then MJ faced challenges from Hakeem and Malone before finally losing his throne to the next generation of players in Duncan and Shaq.  The comparison to the original point of this thread should be obvious. Since taking the throne in the late 00s LeBron has had several challengers. However, like MJ, no one has really caught him and taken the throne. There hasn't been a point since early in his career that anyone would say someone other than LeBron for best player in the league. KD is great but no one has ever considered him the best player in the league. No one was even sure if he was better than Steph on the Warriors, much less LeBron."
"Best coach is subjective, but I genuinely believe that he is a coach that maximizes his roster and gets players to develop. Jaylen Brown went from a guy who couldn’t shoot foul shots to a guy who is a knock down 3 point shooter. Marcus Smart went from a walking punchline to a solid defender and passer. Jayson Tatum has steadily improved. I mean, hell, Isaiah Thomas turned into an MVP candidate under him."

"Last night should be crystal clear to the green teamers that Brad Stevens and Danny Ainge are not fit to lead this franchise, but they will continue to scream until they are red in the face ""the future is bright"" ""next year is our year!""  Brad Stevens is the Celtics equivalent of Scott Brooks/Mark Jackson and should be fired ASAP because he's holding the team back. Danny Ainge has not done a single good thing for this franchise after drafting Jayson Tatum. He's getting old and should retire for both the sake of his health and the sake of this franchise."

"Same can be said about Jaylen ""Michael Jordan"" Brown and Jayson ""Kobe Bryant"" Tatum"
But have you considered Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum?
Jayson Tatum just sat down at the opponents basket while his teammates scrambled for the final shot. Why didn’t he even get past half court? Seems lazy end of game play with the W on the line. I would want Tatum to take that shot. What happened?
"I know I’m a Laker fan and I’m pretty much obligated to hate Celtics, but Jayson Tatum is easily one of my favorite players"
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.

"Yes because defensive Specialist ""Kyle Kuzma"", a DPOY candidate can guard Jason Tatum and Brown of Jaylen better than Montrezl.   Let me remind you this:  Jayson Tatum dropped 41 pts on Kuzma's head on insane efficiency.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzq7rz4QQo  Do you honestly believe Kuzma or the Morris dude can do better than Montrezl Harrell? You need to think hard about this before answering me. If your answer is yes then we won't argue anymore. I can't change your mind/opinion. it is what it is."
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum
why was Jayson tatum at half court during that whole last scramble play lmao man just became a spectator
jayson tatum is fucking legit
"Bruh. Not related, but do yall see Jayson Tatum with the Kobe arm band and playing out of his mind?!!"
"Jayson ""Jaylen ""Michael Jordan"" Brown"" Tatum."
JAYSON TATUM ALL TIME GREAT PASS ALERT PEJA FLASHBACKS WOOOOOOOOW
Jayson Rondo or Rajon Tatum?
Jayson. Christopher. Tatum.
Imagine not having Jayson Tatum on your team. Couldnt be me
"Danny Ainge knows what he's building. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown could easily be All-NBA players. Not trading for AD, a player that didn't want to be here, was the smart move. Not trading for a one year rental of Kawhi was the smart move."
"He’s shooting open shots? I don’t care if his shot is off, I want him shooting that everytime. He isn’t taking some Jayson Tatum step back, he is taking open shots."
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum
C'mon dude. As a Celtics fan you benefited from trading away former All-Stars for picks and assets.  - Nets 2016 1st Round Pick used to get Jaylen Brown at 3. - Nets 2017 1st Round Pick used to get Markelle Fultz later traded for #3 Jayson Tatum and some future pick.
"Not sure why the downvotes,  you're not wrong. Can't get mad at saying that he's not as good as 2 of the top 10 all timers. He could get to that level, just like Jayson Tatum could become better than kobe. Possible but unlikely and definitely not a knock against him"
"He's gonna do well in any model because his floor is so high and he doesnt miss games. I kind of think he'll finish top 5 in MVP voting again this year. Problem is actually finishing no 1. I think for +5000 though I would consider it.   The other one also is Jayson Tatum +8000. It's gonna take alot but this is an open race, he's in a popular market and capable of a hot run. I just dont think LeBron is really gonna do it this year he's in it by default at no 1 I dont think we'll be forced to resort to a default guy by the endo f the year. Someone will emerge and I think the odds of it being a guy with low odds are the best it's been in years."
"I'm so confused with ""above average"" being better than good, and also the idea that someone shooting 50/40 across a season isn't exceptional.  I'd say ""above average"" (which is better than good) doesn't really capture Jayson Tatum sufficiently, for example."
I assume he means Jayson Tatum but yeah no one calls him by those initials lol
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
Cmon man Jayson Tatum is not better than Kyrie
beal played just one more game than kyrie.... and jayson tatum missed games too
he reminds me of an older Jayson Tatum
"16, a year younger than Jayson Tatum."
contract doesn't match i'll take a kemba and Jayson tatum please fair deal.
Better than Jayson Tatum and certainly better than Jaylen Brown
Just remember that Jayson Tatum has more playoff wins than the Sixers franchise does since 2003 and you’ll understand

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."

"This is from their site   &gt; FINISHING AT RIM  Our Finishing at Rim rating seeks to capture how well a player scores at the rim on the attempts they have once there, and doing so while capturing and adjusting for variables that may impact performance finishing at the rim (such as spacing, if they were creating their own shot or not, location of shots, etc.).  These values are represented using z-scores.  One big thing is I currently don’t have access to a synergy account the type you pay $30 for but one thing is they track on there how well guys finish at the rim in the half court or out of more specific situations in that realm. Point is more that allows for better evaluation of finishing by not focusing on plays that just include uncontested layups in transition or what not   And these figures often vary a decent bit from what a players overall percentage from 0-3 ft like you’ll see on bball ref. There are guys like Jayson Tatum as ex who in particular their percentages on finishing on such plays is a good bit lower than you would expect if you just saw what BBall ref had their percentages from 0-3 ft at"
"Boston needs bench depth, but Wings... as crazy as that sounds. last year we had Brown, Tatum, Hayward so there was no reason to get a wing because 1 of them was always on the floor and most of the time 2 of them were out there. Without Hayward this year on the wing we have Jaylen and Jayson. after that the depth is really: Javonte Green, Semi Ojeleye, Romeo Langford (injured), Aaron Neismith. the back up ball handlers are Teague, Pritchard, Edwards and Waters. IT was one of my favorite players, but we couldn’t really use any point guard help right now unless we move some guys."

Although this was a little surprising to me I looked [it up](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612738&amp;StarterState=5v3,5v1,5v2,5v0,4v2,4v1,4v0,3v0,3v1,2v0,2v1,1v0,3v2,4v3,5v4) filtered by the number of times each guy got to play with at least one more starter on their team than the number of starters the opponent had on the court at that time.   This season and last Jayson Tatum has 816 of such minutes. Jaylen Brown has 684 the gap isnt as big as I expected. In other words I dont think there's a big gap in terms of how much time each guy gets to spend in favorable settings in terms of having more starters on the court than the opponent does at that time.  One thing I would say is that alot more teams do this kind of rotation where the star rests early plays the start of the 2nd than 10 years ago. So it's not necessarily the advantage it sounds."
"A lot of those Tatum no Jaylen lineups come at the end of the first and start of the second quarter against bench units, so that’s one reason why those lineups are so good. Jaylen is good but I doubt he could carry the bench lineups the same way Jayson does.   I definitely agree on Jaylen being a bit of an overrated defender. His team defense and off ball defense still leaves a lot to be desired."
"If you can get over the irish thing - Boston Celtics.   Look up Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Tako Fall - most well rounded young trio in the league."
Jumpshot's also kinda similar to Jayson Tatum tbh
"looking at the box score, yea we did. you might wanna change that flair from “Celtics” to “Jayson Tatum”"
"Hello, i would like one Jayson Tatum plz.  Could have won both these games without him, had chances failed. But i think both games are won if we had our top 15 player in the league back."
"Ask it next year and it'll reverse. And then the year after it'll reverse. Or, it will just always be Jayson Tatum haha."
Jayson Tatum last year in the playoffs
I feel like not enough people are pointing out Jayson Tatum has 0 points tonight. Are people really just glossing over his disappearing act?
"If Seth Curry is on the court, he just increases the offense for both teams, he helps the Sixers offense and he'll help the opponents offense.   If he is on the court in closing 5, James Harden/Jayson Tatum/Jimmy Butler etc. will force a switch and get him onto them and he will bleed points.   I've seen this happen to my own damn team, Kemba got hunted by Jimmy a bunch last year."
"https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/brad-stevens-comes-clean-about-how-jayson-tatum-height-drama-started Nah not really, most players ain't growing once they reach 21 or 22 years old"
"JaYson Tatum also went from 6’9 to 6’8, and is now apparently 6’10"
I wad arguing this also. Donovan is a legit two way player and he's 24 years old. Personally I believe he can be a #1 option just like I believe in Jayson tatum.
Jayson tatum and brown getting there
You guys so lucky lol I'm a Celtics fan btw see ya next sunday Jayson tatum coming in 😜

"I generally like Keith Smith on Twitter, and the Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown combo is great! I worry about the Kemba contract, but their young depth pieces are interesting.     Sixers are so intriguing, because they're built the way 2016-2018 OKC should have been built so I may have to give them a try. Thanks!"
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
"As a nets fan, they've traded away the draft rights to:  Dame Lillard (Gerald Wallace)  James Young (Paul Pierce/KG)  Jaylen Brown (Paul Pierce/KG)  Jayson Tatum (Paul Pierce/KG)  Collin Sexton (Paul PIerce/KG)  and now.... they traded 7 picks/swaps in the future... Yes they have 3 of the top 20 NBA players *right now* but if they don't go to the finals or win a ring, they're getting blown up in 2 years.  I don't even want to know what will happen with those picks if that's the case..."
Jayson Tatum can guess the flavor of popsicles by sitting on them
"Unlike Jayson Tatum, James Wiseman is in fact only 19."
His name is jayson tatum
Jayson Tatum over Jo Jo White.
"Man, Chaminade high school has produced some great talent between David Lee, Bradley Beal, and Jayson Tatum."
"In our 2018 Philly series, Brett Brown thought it would be a good idea to have him guard Terry Rozier, who is lightning quick. Then he put 6'3 JJ Redick (with a 6'2 wingspan) on Jayson Tatum.   To this day I'm still offended by how little player scouting they did for that series.  RoCo is a good defender when used in a very specific way. If you treat him like a small-ball PF/C like Houston did then he's fine. Yes, he gets beat off the dribble but every big does."
"Ok fair enough but I don’t think it was about political correctness. Jarrett Allen was effusive in his support of Kyrie.  If he felt differently he could’ve sidestepped it.  If KD is displeased, we  see it, like with Dray or Westbrook.  For all the locker room cancer talk, even all his former Celtics teammates all praised him except al Horford.  Jayson Tatum always talks about his love for Kyrie."
"Give Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Terry Rozier and I guarantee he doesn't flame out in the second round all the while talking about he should've shot more, when he's like 2 for fucking 17. Kyrie hasn't done shit without having a top three player on his team."
"r/nba: lmaoooo playoff P!!! Pandemic P!!! Side of the backboard P lmaooooo  Also r/nba: Danny Ainge didn’t trade Jayson Tatum for Paul George, is he even a top 25 GM?"
"&gt;”Here’s the thing though: I’m not sure getting close and not making the deal has missed for Boston. Trade for a couple of guys and you don’t have (Jayson) Tatum or (Jaylen) Brown. Make a deal for AD (Anthony Davis), and you’re out players and picks, and he probably leaves anyway. I think Danny has been right to walk away and not overpay.”  This is logic that you rarely see on r/nba. 99% of the time Ainge didn’t make a trade that we knew of, it was the right move.  AD would’ve absolutely left, unless Kyrie came back (which still doesn’t guarantee he stays).  Kawhi absolutely would’ve left. Yes the Raptors won, but they gave up way less to get Kawhi than Boston would’ve had to. So because of that, they were able to have an elite team around him. Plus, most people agree they don’t win if GS doesn’t lose Durant.   As for PG and Butler, is there anyone else who still believes *to this day* Ainge should’ve traded one of the picks that became Brown or Tatum to get one of those guys? I mean cmon  These are the types of arguments made against Ainge. They always lack context.   Danny Ainge criticism has always been overblown in literally every aspect. He’s firmly a top 5 GM."
"* **Marcus Smart:** the longest-tenured player on the team and emotional leader is out * **Jayson Tatum:** got COVID, has shown a lack of energy as the game goes on  * **Kemba Walker:** coming off an injury and is currently inconsistent    * **Danny Ainge:** the Celtics are one of the youngest teams in the league, hasn't/didn't traded assets for veteran win-now style players. * **Brad Stevens:** experiments with lineups all season long, at times to the detriment of regular-season wins (I guess in hopes of knowing what he can get out of matchups in the playoffs)  I have much higher expectations for this team and am definitely disappointed this season. The future still looks bright with the Celtics having key pieces locked up for the next 2-3 years on average. At the end of the day, I am grateful to have a team that is consistently competitive but I am becoming impatient watching teams like the rival Lakers winning rings."
"&gt;miss used so many of their   I think people are looking to clown DA...but it’s not like he let his war chest evaporate w nothing to show for it.  * BOS 2014 1st, tanking year: Marcus Smart  * BKN 2014 1st: James Young  * BKN 2016 1st: Jaylen Brown  * BKN 2017 1st: Jayson Tatum  * BKN 2018 1st: traded for Kyrie Irving  * SAC 2019 1st: Romeo Langford  * MEM 2020 1st: Aaron Nesmith  Langford/Nesmith are incomplete. Jays + Marcus are hits. James Young (at #17) was an obvious whiff, and you could make an argument that the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie."
"Yep. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are bonafide stars, All-Defense 1st team Marcus Smart is out. Celtics will turn it around soon. These hot takes are so annoying"
Jayson Tatum tries to avoid contact though

"and, specifically just this season and at this moment, Beal above Tatum. Jayson just hadn't been super good this season yet. probably by the playoffs he's back on and he's a top 15 player."
"Or a Duke fan. Man, it's crazy to see Brandon Ingram, Jayson Tatum, and Zion duke it out on the floor. Oh, and Redick."
"Is he better than current Luka? Luka played much better in their playoff series. Lukas averaging 29/9/9.  You say he’s more impactful than those other ones due to his position like he’s a playmaker. If we’re taking that route Jokic definitely does more to contribute to the offense and playmaking.   I’ll give him being on the cusp with Lillard. On that cusp are also guys like Kyrie, Butler, Jayson Tatum, and arguably Zion. I think Paul George is a great player and I’d currently place him in the 11-16 range. If you want to argue he’s top 7-10 go ahead but in no world is he top 5."

"&gt; iso  isolation, meaning one-on-one. on some plays you will notice the guy with the ball working with a screen, other times they clear a whole side of the court and just let him try to beat his man. that would be iso.  &gt;3&amp;D guys  just means guys that can shoot threes and play defense well. valuable archetype of player, because everybody needs good defenders and if you can just stand there and hit open threes you are valuable on offense. it's basically the ideal mold for a role player.  &gt;wing defenders  wings are a pretty broad term for guys that play the 2 or 3 (usually 3s probably?). bigger than your small guards, but not big guys that sit in the paint. lebron, paul george, kawhi, jayson tatum type players.  &gt; off ball players  just meaning they do a lot of work without the ball. creating separation so you can shoot is huge in basketball, some guys are very good at creating this without the ball in their hands.   if you have any other specific questions feel free to ask.  &gt;Which player's highlights would you recommend to get me really hooked on the game? Damian Lillard's half court game winners are absolutely electric imo.  my favorite non-sun to watch is kyrie irving. probably the best dribbling skills in the history of the league, and just one of the smoothest players to ever do it. i've heard people say before that he plays the game in cursive and i think that fits his playstyle  https://youtu.be/HeK6Z-OR7gY?t=43  one of my favorite highlight videos of all time"

"&gt;Jaylen isn't comparable as a playmaker to Tatum. He also turns over the ball far more often.  5.2ast/100 to 6.5ast/100  4.2tov/100 to 3.4tov/100  If you want to say Tatum is literally a better playmaker than Brown, then that's accurate, but to say that he isn't comparable, or that he turns the ball over ""far more"" is just a lie.   &gt;Neither stats nor the eye test support that.  Jaylen Brown has a defensive rating of 112, .9 defensive win shares, -0.5 DBPM, -0.2 Def RAPTOR  Jayson Tatum has a defensive rating of 111, 1 defensive win share, 0.0 DBPM, and 0.0 Def RAPTOR  Both the eye test and the stats say they're basically the exact same lol."
"Harden and Jayson Tatum look like locks for reserves. Zach LaVine has been playing his way into the ASG as of late. Jimmy Butler, though he's missed a lot of games, should be in due to his value to the Heat. Sabonis putting up good enough numbers to be in. Jaylen Brown will probably join Tatum. As a Knicks fan, I'll go with Julius Randle for the last spot."
"No, I think he has a better case than Sabonis, arguable with vucevic, but Vucevic is producing on a team that has been blasted by injuries and is just generally worse than the Knicks (they might have the worst point guard situation in the NBA).  Aside from that, I would have him behind Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum, Khris Middleton, and Giannis. That would have him at like 7th or 8th in the eastern conference frontcourt, so no, I don't think he deserves to be an all-star."
"Nets picks have turned out to be: Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, and motherfuckin' Colin Sexton.  Nets picks when used by anyone else are all-stars."
When you have jayson tatum and jaylen brown you are not in rebuild I mean you dont need picks when you have that two I think they should trying to build a solid bench solid roleplayer in free agency and looking for more trade options

"Pretty sure Pippen was top 3 in mvp voting in '94.

Players that are elite scorers and above average playmakers at their position that are also first team all defense leaving their team for nothing and they stay in the same spot.  Examples in 2021 is like Kawhi, AD, Giannis, Lebron, KD, jayson tatum, bam just die tomorrow and the team carries on nearly unaffected.   Can't even add Steph or dame to that list bc they're only half of the prerequisites."

"Are you saying every player in the NBA is going to get COVID? That's absurd. A disease that attacks your lungs and oxygenation levels in the blood, reducing cardiovascular health in a player that relies on their cardiovascular health to play a game isn't concerning.   We still don't know of all the long term side effects for COVID, and you have guys like Jayson Tatum saying that he doesn't feel the same coming back from COVID. You should be slightly worried about his production and his conditioning."
I guess this is favorable https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30912183/boston-celtics-jayson-tatum-says-feeling-effects-covid-19 huh?
"I mean, besides pulling off one of the best/most lopsided trades of recent NBA history and using the haul to draft Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum and build a contender that's been to the Conference Finals 3 of the last 4 years I guess the Celtics have no vision/plan?"
"Jayson is the better player. It’s exceedingly clear watching the team that the team lives and dies with him.  Jaylen is an excellent player but he’s not able to impact the game yet on the same level as Tatum. I’m not gonna bet against Jaylen taking another leap. He seems to do it every year, but just watching the team when Tatum is in vs out is night and day. Jaylen doesn’t impact the game that way unless he’s shooting lights out."

Lebron on the Warriors in this year’s West would not come close to sniffing the Finals. His Cavs team in 2018 got taken to 7-games by a Celtics team missing their best player lead by a 14 PPG scorer in rookie Jayson Tatum
"After that one bad game on yesterday, Jayson Tatum has become the official punching bag of r/nba. I wonder who it will be next week."
"For perspective, Ben’s 19 points in the 1st were over three times as many as Jayson Tatum had in 4 quarters against the Wizards yesterday. Again, just for perspective"
Better than Jayson Tatum
"How Kyrie not better then Jayson Tatum, Middleton, bam, Mitchell..."
"Kind of, but that seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction. Like, what is a player like Jayson Tatum? The Celtics may list him as a forward, but his skill set and usage is fairly similar to a guard. It just seems like an unnecessary way to prevent the five most popular players from being starters."
nah man Ainge won a chip back in the day as a GM and he picked Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown so he's totally immune from any criticism
"Yea, but there's 0 reason to bring up the C's. We have literally no way of getting him outside of throwing Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, or Kemba Walker at them"
"The Fact that Terry Rozier, rookie Jayson Tatum and 2nd year Jaylen Brown marched through the playoffs and just about made the NBA finals is crazy"
"I didn't say he was wrong 😂  But truth be told, I for one was never big on Jayson Tatum and suggested multiple times (maybe not here) that Boston could and should have traded him while there was this ""He's only ""x age"" hype surrounding him. He was perfect bait IMHO.  Not hating on him, but I think he's been hella overrated ever since he trained with Kobe (RIP)."
I feel like he's getting downvoted cause his post implies Jayson Tatum is not a true superstar 😂
"I didn’t watch the game yesterday but it seems they don’t really pass?   Everyone, please meet Boston Celtics’ starting backcourt. In yesterday’s game, Kemba got himself 25 points with 2 assists. Jaylen also with 25 points and 0 assists.   Their star player Jayson Tatum.. Mind blowing 4 assists ! With 8 points. Their starting lineup came up with a total of 8 assists (Theis had 2). And their bench contributed another 6 assists.  Now I’m no statistician but just for comparison Harden got himself 16 assists in his last game... so yeah."
Jayson Tatum with COVID: chill until he’s healthy

"They should use the TPE, but Vuc is going to command at least one first-round pick, if not more. Why would they give up a package like that when it's not going to make them title contenders this year. Vuc is also not a cheap contract and has two years left. Do you really want to be paying Kemba and Vuc $60 million in two years when Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are starting to make decisions about their future? It's too early into Tatum and Brown's careers with the Celtics to make an all-in move like that."
I think the pelicans should trade Bledsoe and JJ Redick for Jayson Tatum
Not if you’re Jayson Tatum. Also Siakam got hacked. Point is refs are inconsistent as fuck and garbage and the NBA needs to let these guys play.
"Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan, Kawhi Leonard"
"Payton Pritchard saw Jurassic Park and hated the Raptors, so he always makes sure to get his revenge against the Raptors.   Jayson Tatum loved Harry Potter as a boy, so he goes easy on the Wizards in order to show his appreciation."
"Yeah it's crazy that Demar and Domantas are at the same position. PF nowadays can really be anything, from a point forward like Demar to a rim finisher/shooter like John Collins, to a perimeter shot creator like Jayson Tatum."
"""Jayson Tatum is SOOOO much better than Pascal Siakam""  Oh really? OH REALLY?!?!  jk I love Tatums game and I'm not going to let a couple of meh games convince me he's trash unlike some of these nephews out here"
"There is really no point in comparing them...  BUT IF YOU INSIST:  Starting with defense. Brown is a bit better on ball, he’s actually fantastic, but Tatum is great there too. Last season, Brown was miles ahead in on ball defense but he has regressed in the sense that he is back to jumping on a ton of fakes. Still great in that regard. Off-ball. Tatum is miles ahead here. This may be because of coaching or may just be Brown, but he helps *WAY* too much. It always either ends up with him fouling the guy he helps on or an open three. Tatum isn’t some amazing off ball defender but he is still above average. In the past I would 100% say Brown was the better defender, but this season Tatum has definitely been better on that side of the ball.  Onto offense. Let me just start by saying either of these guys can just get his. But, Brown is the much more efficient ISO scorer (not actually looking at stats, just more of an eye test thing). He has cooled down a little from his insane, historic start from mid range, but he is still elite there. Tatum in the ISO forces up a LOT of bad shots. I’m not completely mad about this because I’m the future I am sure he will make them at a higher rate, but I would definitely rather him chill out on those a little for now. All this majorly helps out Brown in the argument considering Brad Stevens doesn’t really run an offense and is a big ISO coach (which is infuriating). Last season, a lot of times we actually ran a good offense and Tatum thrives in this (especially the month he averages like 30). Tatum is amazing with any space whatsoever so plays that gives him this will work. Everytime. Right now, this season, he is being passed the ball with a defender hanging on his back and it ends up with a bad shot. Finishing. For now I would give the slight edge to Jaylen. Jayson started off the season really bad at finishing but has definitely picked it up a lot. Both are pretty good here but I would give it to Brown. Mid range. Brown. Three point. Tatum. Both are good at each, but both are also a good bit better then the other in their respective categories. Overall, in this offense Brown is given the advantage. But it’s not like it makes Tatum ineffective as he still puts up incredible numbers.  Rebounding. They are basically a wash here. Not much to say about it.  Playmaking. This easily goes to Tatum. Brown has ok assist numbers, but a lot of that is from drive and kicks drawing multiple defenders. This is still playmaking I guess, but it doesn’t require an insane amount of skill. Tatum literally runs point sometimes.   Overall if you are starting a team I think everytime you pick Tatum. He is still like two years younger and can easily and justifiable be argued as the better player.  But either way you go you can definitely make an argument for all around player. Personally, as of now I would go with Tatum but I can easily see someone picking Brown.  In the end, we have both so honestly who cares."
Honestly if you’ve watched slot of C’s this year browns defense has dipped some. Still a good defensive player but it’s took a dip while his scoring has went up. Personally I don’t think brown is really having much of a better year but he’s in the light bc of the leap he took to get where he is. He’s been fantastic. But he can’t carry bench units like they have been having Tatum do quite yet and he doesn’t set up guys around him as consistent as Jayson. But that’s nitpicking really they’ve been great together it’s really the lack of depth that’s hurting the team
"Jayson Tatum just had a pretty bad week, he’s still the best player for sure."
"At this exact point in time, probably Jaylen, but once the playoffs come around it will be Jayson Tatum."
"If Jayson Tatum performs like this, it doesn't matter who the Celtics trade for. They're never going to win many playoff games. Part of the reason the Heat beat them in the playoffs is because Tatum choked in big moments."
the Celtics team construction is ass. they need frontcourt help like Jayson Tatum needs a razor blade.   hard to be a great team when your rim protection is Theis/Semi
Bruh ur team took Markelle Fultz over Jayson Tatum and your criticizing Ainges draft picks?
yeah you guys are really going to win a lot of games with *jayson tatum* leading your team lol
"Total historical revisionism, people were clowning Ainge for passing on Markelle Fultz to take Jayson Tatum. People were *destroying* Ainge for taking Jaylen Brown.   Most players who are drafted into the NBA don't pan out (how many second round picks can you name right now other than Draymond and Jokic). Ainge isn't perfect but people shitting on him for not drafting starters or 6MOY players in the teens and 20s of the draft are mistaken."
Jayson Tatum 🤝 Russell Westbrook  🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱
"If not worse this trade is as bad. Harden, Durant, and Ky will all get angry and leave when they have a chance. That means that the Nets won’t have a single pick, no Kyrie, no Durant, and no Harden without a single way to get young players for the future. Just like the Celtics getting Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum the Rockets will be able to get top 3 picks yearly while still being a good team centered around Wood. It’s the same situation as the Celtics. It will be a rebuild where the team doesn’t even need to rebuild."
"I think you could go lower than that.  Because the other team isn't 10 of X.  So say 10 Jayson Tatum, sure at very top AD and Lebron will outtalent the top 2 Tatums but even in starting lineup, the other 3 Tatums have a big talent advantage over the other 3 lakers.  Not to mention any bench minutes, 6-8 Tatums are huge advantage over Lakers bench minutes however low it might be."
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum gunning for that spot lol (sorry my biased shamrock colored glasses got the best of me there)
1. Steph Curry ......... 47.2%   2. Zach LaVine ........ 36.9   3. Jamal Murray .......36.9   4. James Harden ..... 36.8   5. Dame Lillard .........36.0   6. Luka Doncic ......... 35.7   7. Jayson Tatum ....... 34.6   8. Jordan Clarkson ... 33.3
"Pretty sure Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Victor Oladipo, Derozan, Lowry, and Derrick Rose were the best players in the East the Cavs faced in their 4 finals runs.  &gt;The Jordan Bulls beat Magic, Isiah Thomas, Barkley, Shaq, Stockton/Malone in the playoffs.  Magic, Barkley, Stockton/Malone all played in the West Jordan didn't face them in the East."
The play-in game where he got hit in the face with two hands and poked in the eye? Jayson Tatum just left a playoff game because he got poked in the eye: https://streamable.com/nxuni6  You guys are just awful people. Chris Paul pulls anyone else's shoulder like that and everyone criticizes him for being dirty. He does it to Lebron and Lebron is the one who is criticized. Fuck outta here.
You saw Jayson Tatum leave the game tonight with a poked eye right?

Just a small reminder that Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum were the only players on rookie deals who were extended this offseason on a max deal and given a player option for the last year..just file that away in your mental rolodex
"I really don't think it's an outlier for this particular series, the Wizards have no forward defense they just gave up 50 points to Jayson Tatum. Harris is either gonna have Hachimura or Bertans or a short guard on him all series, of course he is gonna cook. He sucked the last two playoffs because he was going up against the 19 Raptors and 20 Celtics both of which had good to elite wing defenders."
Offensively Jaylen Brown statistically had an almost identical post season 2018 as Jayson Tatum. And Al Horford statistically had a superior post season 2018 than both of them. So “lead” is a reach.
Hawks can’t stop Alec Burks but wanted to play Jayson Tatum
"hey tell that to jayson tatum lol, the wiz really tried"
Jayson Tatum he’s had over 50 three tiles this year
"Ah yes Jayson ""Get to the line"" Tatum"
"Very true for the Celtics.  **Jayson Tatum** got COVID in January and needed an inhaler during games afterward. He didn't appear fully recovered until late March.  **Robert Williams** only played 52 games, missing time with various injuries, including a knee injury that kept him out for a couple of key weeks down the stretch in April.  **Jaylen Brown** tore a ligament in his wrist in early May, missing the end of the regular season and the *entire playoffs*.  **Kemba Walker** missed the first month of the season with a knee injury.  **Marcus Smart** missed 1.5 months with a calf injury.  Those are arguably the five most important Celtics. Since late March, when Tatum appeared fully recovered from COVID, the Celtics are 7-2 in games all five of them play. Unfortunately, with JB out for the playoffs, we won't see anything close to a full-strength Celtics team in the playoffs."

Jayson tatum
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are not the much ballyhooed Nets pick.
"I laughed so hard when they gave Kevin Durant a flagrant foul on Jayson Tatum. The NBA has been a joke for over 10 years, and it's getting worse. It's why I rarely watch it these days outside of a Durant / Curry game."
Yes. There chances of winning went up in my book today because of KD’s defense of Jayson Tatum
2 egregious offensive fouls and instead Jayson Tatum gets called for the foul. Ridiculous composure from tatum to not get ejected there
Jayson Tatum looks like the best player on the floor today. Who said defense didn't matter as much anymore?
Does Jayson Tatum have potential? /s
Nothing would make me happier than a Jayson Tatum statement series.
Imagine putting this bitch ass nets team together in hopes of taking down Jayson Tatum. Must suck
"two on Jayson Tatum drives actually, but close enough"
"The clear sign that Harden and Durant do not have what it takes to lead a team, unlike Kyrie, is that they need a quarter to shake the nerves. Jayson Tatum, on the other hand, would be winning this series single handedly if he had a number two who understood their role and a coach who could handle the role players."
They really gave Jayson Tatum to a prime Jabari Parker huh
Who is gonna tell Jayson Tatum that he's not a good midrange shooter?
Doris Burke calling a Celtics game. Hope they have a plastic seat cover for her. She orgasms every time she says “Jayson Tatum”.
Dorris Burke is obsessed with Jayson Tatum
How does it feel knowing Jayson Tatum went farther in the playoffs as a rookie than Giannis ever will with the Bucks
"Clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game ball is inbounded to Tatum who turns face to face against Durant   ""You took my family""   moves to the left   ""You took my friends""   moves to the right   ""You took all that was dear to me""   clock winds down to 2   ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR MY FRIENDS"" goes up, fire coming out of his shoes   ""TATUMRUKEN”   Ball flies over Lebrons head, goes straight into basket. Jayson falls to the ground, exhausted.   ""Kyrie... Senpai... I...""   faints  Final Score   Nets 103   Celtics 63"
Oh dang   Same age as Jayson Tatum
"&gt;If you can trade him + everything for a top 15 player you do it  What Top 15 player will a team trade away for Wiggins, Wiseman (the worst rookie in years) and a pick for? Unless that star tanks his trade value to the point of threatening to quit basketball unless he's traded, I don't see who you can get  I know you were just mentioning a hypothetical, but the bottom end of Top 15 is like Jayson Tatum tier IMO, so keep that in mind"
Jayson Tatum
1. Demar Derozan 2. Pascal Siakam 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steve Nash 6. Jamal Murray 7. RJ Barrett  8. Jeremy Lin 9. Norman Powell  10. Jayson Tatum
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

Only 5 separations between Jerry West and Jayson Tatum. Who the hell is Kermit Washington? He connects   Jerry and a lot of people together.  Edit: 4 connections between Collin sexton and Kareem is wild.
"PG: Luka Doncic SG: Jaylen Brown, SF:  Jayson Tatum, PF: Ben Simmons, C: Jokic  Not only do I have scoring, defense, length and multiple ball handlers mixed through out this line up, I have longevity.   Picking guys like Steph, Lebron, Kawhi and KD would be better.....for a couple years. All of them are in their 30s and have a lot of mileage. KD, Kawhi and Lebron are getting hurt more than they ever have recently which shows they are slowing down. My line up is tearing up the league for a decade+."
The eye test has shown me that free throws are still shot just as often in the playoffs as in the regular season. Stats show it too. Dirk shooting 24 free throws in a game against the Thunder is just one of many examples which challenge the theory that refs don’t call as many fouls in the postseason. Or Jayson Tatum shooting 17 on Tuesday
Jayson Tatum
"lol, I used Mikan too, 7 degrees from him to both Jayson Tatum and Antony Bennett"
Jayson Tatum
"Biased but yea, Tatum willing his team to a W is great. Its one of those games where a guy is just straight up unstoppable and it doesn't matter if the game is a blowout. It doesn't matter if it was Jayson, Steph, Lebron, Giannis or basically any other All-Star, watching a guy go off like that is always fun"
dont worry he posted 'Jayson Tatum is the best player on the planet right now.' too
Jayson Tatum had 50 the other night and I literally didn't even realize he was on the court.
"AD after watching Jayson Tatum yesterday: ""hold my bricks"""
Jayson Tatum
"Dillon ""Jayson Tatum"" Brooks"
"It’s not hating him, we just actually watch games.  Westbrook is a top 30 player and has an argument for top 25, top 20 possibly if you really push it, but he is nowhere close to being the best player in the league, or top 15 for that matter.   I can say Jayson Tatum is not a top 5 player in the league and still love him as a player."
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier. Sounds like a pretty solid team to me. Except it wasn't, and we know exactly why, because only one of those guys is still a shitty teammate. And it just so happens he was supposed to be the one that held it all together."
"Kyrie was supposed to be the leader, the glue that kept 21 year old Jayson Tatum and notorious asshole Marcus Morris on track. Instead, he fucking bailed. It's not about ""who was good"", it's about Kyrie making EVERYONE worse."
"Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, and Jayson Tatum probably won't even make All-NBA this year, so I'm going to say there are at least 20-25 guys in the NBA who you can build around.  They're not all top-7 guaranteed playoff run guys, but they're building blocks."
i would put mitchell a tier below jayson tatum
Pacers playing great basketball / talking shit &amp; Jayson Tatum dropping 50 is somehow bad basketball.
"we should all just keep an open mind, countless times we all thought a superteam was gonna dominate the season/playoffs/championship but they flop and fail horribly. lets not get ahead of ourselves. i think itll at least be a great series. only thing is celtics going in weakened without brown but jayson tatum may or may not go supersaiyan so who knows"
"a restaurant near me used to dice up jalapenos into their BBQ sauce to make a spicy BBQ and it was the best wing sauce ever. sadly they got bigger, franchised out a couple locations, and their handmade spicy BBQ gave way to some crappy chipotle BBQ that they could presumably get in a bottle. i've been chasing spicy BBQ wings ever since but no one else around here makes them.  i'll be really happy if Spicy BBQ becomes a thing because of Jayson Tatum."
"Jayson Tatum doesn’t spend any money he makes from his contract, just cash from Ads"
"Yes, people are going to clown you, but only because you said a 23 year old Jayson is a better scorer than *two of the best scorers in NBA history*. The only one of the big three Tatum is even remotely close to is Kyrie and you’d still have to be delusional to say as of today (not talking about potential) Jayson is a better scorer than Kyrie."
"idk why I even read threads like these, it's just full of straight circlejerk garbage. The guy is a career 40% 3 point shooter on high volume which is obviously extremely impressive. He torched the Nuggets and Suns this year with some incredible shooting games. They signed him to shoot, and he's great at it, but all shooters can have bad outings occasionally. Think about all the times Jayson Tatum has gone like 4/22 from the field and he's a max player. It happens, and it's not like 20M/year for Bertans is an albatross"
"&gt;Rui Hachimura, the primary Jayson Tatum defender and one of the only players who can guard Tatum, picked up 3 fouls within the first 6 minutes of the game.  Rui got his third foul with 4 minutes left in the first half.  Very hard to tell without replays, but the [first one](https://streamable.com/49719e) could have gone either way, the [second one](https://streamable.com/nq7ss2) looked soft (but hard to know given the angle), and the [third one](https://streamable.com/wje5b4) was a boneheaded take foul for a guy who was already in foul trouble."
"""such a shame he's in Boston""  Yeah because every good player should be in Los Angeles for their legacy to be valid. Piss off, Jayson Tatum is a Boston Celtic (and I hate the Celtics as a Cavs fan)"
Jayson Tatum just played the best Play-In game in NBA History.
"You are literally just making this up, no one ranked Kemba above Tatum and Celtics fans did not hate on, nor slander Jayson"
As a lakers fan you gotta be happy that the team chose the superior Lonzo ball over the virgin Jayson tatum right?
"Why would anyone slander Jayson Tatum?   He shouldnt have star expectations yet, hes only 19, its normal for these players to hit a rookie wall  Good thing he’s pulling through but it would be just dumb to slander such a young player anyway"

"They literally won their last game despite shooting the exact same percentage from the field (33%)  But the massive difference is Jayson Tatum and Brad Stevens.   If the coach is smart, he’ll put one of the best isolation defenders statistically in Rui on him and won’t elect to let him rot on the bench with 5 fouls and 17 minutes played. Or even Hutchison, although not as good, just anyone w/ size besides a hobbled Beal."
"I mean even if he didn't want to leave Rui out with 4 fouls to start the 3rd he could've rotated Hutchinson and given Gill minutes (who has the size) just so you try to get physical with Tatum, make him work harder for his points.  But then your lineup is 3 guards over whom Tatum can shoot with no trouble (I would've said if he gotten the switch on any of them but he didn't have to cus his main defender was Beal, who had to give up lots of energy on defense defending Jayson) and Bertans and Len who have the size but are nowhere near capable of defending Tatum, especially Bertans who is a total negative on the defensive end, he should've switched his minutes with Garrison Matthews or Hutchinson but then again no plays were ran for Davis so...  I am by no means an expert in basketball coaching, but somebody please explains to me Scott Brooks approach to this game"
"JAYSON TATUM SAVES STEVENS JOB  Following their absolute slaughter of the Washedington Wizards Jasyon Tatum, who dropped a mind-bending 50 on the night, said in his post-game interview that he ""didn't want to lose Brad"". Putting in a masterful performance he saved the recently-under-fire coach from Danny Ainge, one of the most ruthless GMs in the NBA.  read more..."
And that 5 minutes' name? Jayson Tatum
Marv Albert said Bradley Beal was younger than Jayson Tatum at the beginning of the game lol.
"Fr, he somehow had to bring up LeBron during his praise of Jayson Tatum shooting 17-17 from the free throw line tonight"
"Not defending Brooks, but if you have a basketball dilemma like guarding Jayson Tatum and your answer is Anthony Gill or Chandler Hutchinson, that problem remains unsolved."
&gt;How to beat the Wizards  &gt; Use Jayson Tatum  But how does one acquire Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum joins Celtics legend Kemba Walker as the only players to score more than 25 points and go 100% from the free throw line in a play-in game
"If there hasn't already been a Jayson Tatum coming out party, this series could possibly elevate him to that next level. He's needs to do great things for the Celtics to even have a chance in this series."
Jayson “Jaylen ‘Jaylen ‘Michael ‘God’ Jordan’ Brown’ Brown” Tatum
"terrible game. Firstly, fire scott brooks. Also Jayson Tatum had to have the best game of his career on this exact day where russ and beal also had terrible games.   BTW why does Len get to be in the NBA but not Lin? Also Bertans contract is a waste of money. Dude is just not good. Everytime I see him jack up a shot i have less faith in it going in then Russ' shot. I know he shot 39% from the three but its so on and off."
"I just realized that if you count the Play-In game as part of the playoffs, that means Jayson Tatum has a 50 point playoff game and Shaq doesn't."
&gt; Jayson Tatum ~~woke up~~ was born today and chose violence  FTFY
"So we get the worst possible play in outcomes:  A Celtics “team” which is basically Jayson Tatum and nothing else  The bland, boring, faceless, nameless Pacers"

JAYSON TATUM IS A SUPERSTAR! THATS IT.
"Jayson Tatum is just insane. I love watching this guy. Unfortunately, now we play Brooklyn, and I don't know if we can even steal a game with our health situation. Just no more injuries in this upcoming series please."
I am also no expert but I think it's hard to win a game when a Kobe-possessed Jayson Tatum is on the other team
Jayson “Jaylen ‘Michael ‘God’ Jordan’ Brown” Tatum  Edit: What the fuck did I just type
"Scott Brooks, this is how you don't guard Jayson Tatum..."
"That's all-time NBA Play-in Tournament scoring champion Jayson Tatum, put some respect on his name"
"Not saying he's anywhere near the *most* underrated, but Jayson Tatum has objectively been the 2nd best defender on the Celtics the last couple of years, and probably deserved an All-Defense nod in 2020. He's legitimately one of the best help defenders in the league, he's a nightmare in passing lanes, and he can absolutely lock down big wings even if he's not quite quick enough to stop explosive drivers."
Ill say it again and people can downvote me again.  Give me Jayson Tatum over Luka ANYDAY
Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum
"Had no depth last year, between being a top 5 youngest team in the league and literally the most affected team by covid, and smart, kemba, williams, and Brown injuries. The entire season was essentially the Jayson Tatum show and everyone on the other team knew it"
Jayson Tatum *please* take this as a slight and go HAM
"Celtics have never had a great free agent superstar willingly sign since the big 3. Kyrie was traded to Cs and then lied and left. Al Horford was never that big of a star and they couldn’t retain him. Hayward was barely a star when he joined. The only guys staying are the Js who are coming off rookie deals. In all honesty, unless Jayson Tatum stays long term the Celtics are an organization with a storied past that may not be reflected in the future. Why would anyone willingly want to be based out of Boston?  Also the Pelicans, good lord, the sheer amount of talent New Orleans has had and to be this bad still. Once again, why would anyone logically choose the Pelicans of their own free will if they didn’t have other opportunities. Zion is already unhappy, how bad does an organization have to be to be to sour a relationship that quickly. The biggest signing was Jrue Holiday as a FA. Good lord, you look at the Spurs today, no one shits on them and yet there are already talks of “how will they ever find a rebuild”  Milwaukee and Denver have top 5 players and no FA is running to join them. How often did a superstar think of joining SAS big 3? Role player Pau? LMA? Market always wins, org is literally just “who is the least annoying”. Orgs thinking they are special..these stars make hundreds of millions of dollars, they’d rather have their own doctors."
"&gt;we have way more leverage right now than we did with AD.  Are you guys looking to trade him right now?  &gt;Jayson Tatum isn’t trying to leave Boston because of the IT trade  That's the Celtics though. They have other things to their organization.   They also have a team around him.  &gt;and super stars already don’t want to play here, so we have no reason to do what they want.  That is not a good ideology.   &gt;It’s like how everyone says that “teams show players no loyalty, so why should a player show the team loyalty?” Players don’t show the Pelicans loyalty, so why should the Pelicans show them lowalty?”  Players don't show y'all loyalty because you guys aren't good at creating competent teams."
"Even if it does hurt his trade value, it won’t hurt it a lot. It happened with AD to a much larger level and we still got a huge package for him, and we have way more leverage right now than we did with AD.  Also, if Zion wants to leave already, I doubt we care about how future superstars will feel about this trade. Jayson Tatum isn’t trying to leave Boston because of the IT trade, and super stars already don’t want to play here, so we have no reason to do what they want.  It’s like how everyone says that “teams show players no loyalty, so why should a player show the team loyalty?” Players don’t show the Pelicans loyalty, so why should the Pelicans show them lowalty?”"
Eh Fultz kinda leaped from a top 5/10 to No. 1 guy over the course of that college season leading up to the draft. Jayson Tatum and Lonzo Ball were bigger names in HS
Why do people think other r/nba users like these kind of threads. Fuck lebron and the lakers. I'm tired of only seeing posts sucking them off. Jayson Tatum is gonna boom Lebron in the finals en route to a sweep. Rant over
Jayson Tatum as a GM?
Who would you rather have on your team Paul George or Jayson Tatum
"Danny Ainge built a team with Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams.  At some point the GM can only do so much. Danny Ainge did everything in his power to start a dynasty, it just didn't work out for non-front office reasons."
PG: Kyrie SG: Ray Allen SF: Jayson Tatum PF: Larry Bird C: Shaquille O'neal
There’s a running joke on this sub that Jayson Tatum is still a fetus
Jayson Tatum is older than herro by two years lol
And his younger brother? Jayson Tatum.
Jayson Tatum is grossly overrated. He's not even the best player on his own team.
"Jayson Tatum is one of the most overrated players here. He's done nothing to separate himself from young guys like Trae, Book, and Mitchell yet ppl act like he's on a completely different tier. Only young player who's on a tier by himself is Luka"
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"I just don't get the whole narrative around it  Shouldn't the second best player of all time BE EXPECTED to beat a team led by Victor Oladipo, DeMar DeRozan, or 19 year old Jayson Tatum who averaged 14 PPG that season, providing that his supporting cast isn't literally the Process Sixers(which they weren't?)  I've literally seen people bring his run up to say ""LeBron would have beat the Bucks this year/qualified from the playoffs in the West"" as a way to bash Durant or Curry but WHEN did LeBron beat a guy as good as Giannis all on his own, OR make the playoffs in the West with a horrible supporting cast(he tried to and failed in 2019?)"
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."

Jayson Tatum joins the Brooklyn Nets with their brand new max slot.
"Yeah I didn't realize that it pretty much directly turned in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kyrie (for a couple years). Ainge was probably ecstatic that that opportunity fell into his lap like that"
Giannis-Boban-Adams-Jrue Holiday-Jayson Tatum for wholesome players.   Idk why you have Hookah Doncic in here lmao.
"I love him, but Jayson Tatum is pretty egregious with this walking up the court. Not even for a reason, just 10 ft from the defender his hand is at 6 oclock each dribble"
Jayson Tatum got an opt-out on his extension for Summer 2025 - seems like a smart move
"KD, Giannis, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, DeAaron fox"
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Joel Embiid  Bench  LaMelo Ball / Jamal Murray / Austin Rivers / Lu Dort / Jae Crowder / Robert Covington / Clint Capela  I legitimately think this team can go 82-0 if injuries are not a factor.
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Giannis, Embiid"
"PG: LeBron James (SS) SG: Brad Beal (AS) SF: Kevin Durant (SS) PF: Jayson Tatum (AS) C: Rob Williams  6-12 FVV, Seth Curry, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis, Tacko Fall"
It's arguable that PG and Jayson Tatum could be Super stars but I don't think they are THAT good.
Yea he’s good but so is Jayson Tatum and I don’t see anyone complaining about that selection
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
"PG isn’t a superstar, he’s an All-Star. Do you think Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum and every other top 15-20 player is a superstar?"
"PG: Shai Gilgeous Alexander  SG: Paul George (allstar)  SF:  Kevin Durant (superstar)  PF: Jayson Tatum (allstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  \---  Bench PG: Fred Vanvleet  Bench SG: Mikal Bridges  Bench SF: OG Anunoby  Bench PF: Robert Covington  Bench C: Myles Turner  \---  Third string: Marcus Smart  Third string: Marcus Morris  &amp;#x200B;  I think starting lineup is basically impossible to guard. Bench is more so developed to focus on defense and basically hold the fort down while my starting lineup rests. Third string are luxury players for niche lineups. For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."
"PG: Steph Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  Bench: RoCo, Issac, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, Myles Turner, Andrew Wiggins, MPJ  My starting lineup is just the 2017 Warriors except I upgraded Klay to PG, downgraded KD to Tatum, and gave them AD to completely destroy their biggest weakness  My bench is just valuable role players mostly 3 and D and Lamelo and MPJ to boost the offense  Gave myself an extra challenge of not putting any borderline stars in here like Fox and SGA. MPJ is the closest and I don’t believe he’s on the other guys level"

PG: Steph Curry  SG: Bradley Beal/Devin Booker/Donovan Mitchell (Preference)  SF: LeBron James  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Christian Wood
Heck yeah. Imagine a one point game with 24 seconds left and you got a 1v1 with Jayson Tatum vs Mikal Bridges for the game.
Can Patrick Beverley guard Jayson Tatum?   He did a pretty good job on Devin Booker.
"Russ is the only one who seems like the odd man out there, Either Luka or Trae takes a hit from not being on-ball all the time there, but you do have the same Spain pick and roll/ double drag action the Hawks already run with Jayson Tatum instead of John Collins and Joel Embiid instead of Clint Capela which seems like a lethal action that they could run as frequently as they wanted."
there is no way you can actually believe that Jayson Tatum is a better fit in Phoenix offense over Devin Booker
Jayson Tatum is according to the LEBRON metric in the 99th percentile of defenders.
"What you're looking for are superstar/star players who run their teams offense and/or rarely play off-ball *or* focus on creating their own shot.  For example, the best-worst team (with some wiggling of positions) I can think of would be;  PG: Trae Young  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Joel Embiid  To be fair Embiid would probably slot in alright, but in terms of star C's it's really either him or Jokic and I worry the latter would be able to corral the rest of the time into playing well off-ball."
Booker had two 40 point games that they still lost. Jayson Tatum is changing that?
Then jayson Tatum is on the Phoenix suns.
Hahaha gay joke  jayson tatum is a fetus
I’m not saying he’s bad but he has a tendency to get tunnel vision and jack up shots without getting others involved (similar to Jayson Tatum). His PER is also pretty week for someone who puts up the kind of numbers he does so idk where you’re whole “metrics disagree with you” argument even came from. He had almost identical PER to Westbrook if that tells you anything.  And you never even responded to my comment about him being a turnstile on defense.
Rn I think he’s ranked 11th i’m just saying that he’ll take a leap once the season starts (as he always does) and he has insane potential I read somewhere that he outscored the entire east at one point and in a week he averaged 42 pts (search up jayson Tatum player of the week and compare his stats with the Dbook the other player of the week big difference) he had 3 50 point games and a 60 point game which btw tied the franchise record with Larry Bird. This might be an unpopular take but Tatum has the potential to become the best scorer in the league even better than Luka
"Well for one injuries. Kemba, Smart, Brown, and Tatum only played 18 games together last season. Ik Kenna’s gone obviously, But just having Smart, Brown, and Tatum on the court together will make the team improve. A lot of games last year they were playing with just one or 2 of them. Also theCeltics were right in that 3-4 seed range when Tatum came down with COVID, and when he came back we were in the 8 seed range. Even with a month left In the season they were at the 4 seed, then a losing streak dropped them down to 7.   Other than injuries which were a big part of last season for most teams, the Celtics defense should improve, getting rid of Kemba and Tristian, bringing in better defensive players like Horford and Richardson. Also Aaron Nesmith played well last year, and could make a jump to a pretty good rotation piece, he was already solid defensively last year, and his offense should improve this year, he was a knockdown shooter in college I could see him having a very good year.   Next is Robert Williams, who is an all star level player if Healthy, which I know is a big if. Next is ball movement, where the Celtics really struggled last year, but with bringing in a new coach I think some of those problems like the offense getting stagnant and iso ball will change.   And finally, The biggest reason is Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. I think that duo is better than any one in the east besides Nets/Bucks, and expect each to take a step forward, Tatum has MVP potential imo. Obviously it might not all work out, but if each team reaches their ceiling I could see the Celtics being as high as the 3rd seed, and I think it’s really close between them and the Heat, but I give the Celtics the edge because of the stars. But it is very close, not much difference between the 3-6 seeds it seems."
"He may not be the GOAT, but Jayson Tatum is the ZyGOAT"
Either Brad Beal or Jayson Tatum right now. I think they have the scoring ability and the type of team that would let them go crazy.
"Jayson Tatum for Bill Russell? I think so, Russell and Brown would be a sick pair. Russell would be the ultimate switch 5 and the best rebounder in the league. Would be easier to find a wing or guard to pair with them than it is to find a big to pair with Tatum now"
"No, now hear me out, I’m a Celtics fan, larry bird is better than Jayson Tatum all time, but with Larry’s back issues, I just don’t think he would be able to keep up like Jayson tatum can in today’s game"
Jayson Tatum for Jayson Tatum? I'd do it in a heartbeat
"Patty Mills, Jayson Tatum, and Rudy Gobert made me spit out my milkshake"
"Jaylen Brown - Luigi. He's a star in his own right, but is resigned to playing second fiddle to Mario / Jayson Tatum. And he rocks a green outfit."

It caused a very healthy Jayson Tatum to have to use an inhaler for months after. Considering some guys have heart issues or asthma (pre-existing conditions) I wouldn’t be so sure about everyone having mild cases

Jayson Tatum had a 1/18 game a year or two ago. It was....not pretty.
Jayson Tatum. Say what you want but his off-season grind is going to dramatically improve his PER on the court this season and will lead the Celtics to the ECF
Trae&gt;Jayson Tatum
"Only two years ago there was a thread asking if you would rather have Jayson Tatum or PJ Tucker for the upcoming season.   The most popular answers were PJ Tucker.   Tatum averaged 23, 7 and 3 on 43/40/81 shooting the next season and lead his team to the ECF.   Tucker averaged 7ppg and shot 36% from 3."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"Not true, those teams did not have comparable level of talent. Looking at All-Star teammates only is ignoring the other HoFers in Russell's teams that contributed heavily, but didn't make All-Stars for various reasons, guys like Frank Ramsey and Satch Sanders instantly come to mind.  Wilt had great teammates at the time because everyone had it, there were very few teams in the league and rosters were stacked with HoFers, but Bill had the greatest collection of talent the league has ever seen in those teams.  The '62 Celtics had a starting lineup of Cousy, Heinsohn, Jones, Russell and Sanders, all of whom are in the Hall of Fame, they also had two bench players that are also in the Hall (Ramsey and K.C). You wanna know who this team added the very next year to their already stacked roster? John Havlicek. It would be like if the Nets had KD/Harden/Kyrie next year and then casually added Jayson Tatum."
I think Jaylen Brown is a better and more important part of the Celtics than Jayson Tatum
"Trust me, your judgement about Jaylen will never be better than your average guy in r/bostonceltics. Most of us watch every regular season Celtics game. Believe me you are wrong. Jayson Tatum is better in all area and I even named my son Jaylen and I will admit Jayson is currently better. Sophomore JB is prolly better than Rookie Jayson but that its. Of course, I would love to be proven wrong."
Missed out the chance to say: “Jayson Tatum tries to bam Adebayo”
On a side note I think Jayson Tatum will be top 5 in 2 years from now
"Love how upvotes could mean you might actually be making people think about it and agree, or they're just not that hot of a take to begin with.  Also homer takes getting downvoted, as they should be. Nobody needs to hear how Zach Lavine is better than Donovan Mitchell or Jayson Tatum coming from a Bulls fan."
Donvan Mitchell &gt;Jayson Tatum
As long as its not Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown
So do you. There is no way Zach Lavine is better than Jayson Tatum. Ask any GM or anyone or maybe the janitor on your 3rd grader if who will they pick between JT or Zach. I bet your ass no one would even think twice on picking Jayson Tatum. Straight answer JT every fucking time.
"thats true and it was the smart move for OKC at the time.  i don't think OKC selling high on a 29-year old PG set to earn $106M over the next three seasons is comparable to 23 year old Jayson Tatum entering a 5-year deal.  what you're suggesting would be fairly unprecedented.  and again it was a smart move for OKC, but they are also just a much more poorly run franchise.  constantly building for a future that never comes."
"The one chance in his life he got to play a professional basketball player, and he was just messing around? Jayson Tatum comes to your court, calls on you to play 1s--- you're just gonna 'mess around', waste everyone's time? I seriously doubt that lol."
"My god, Jayson Tatum is coming."
They need another star player alongside them. I think Jayson Tatum can be the best player on a Championship team if he has the right pieces around him down the line.
Jayson Tatum finally decided to pick on someone his own age.
"Kyrie aint kyrie without AI in the league.  How quickly the past fades away for us. Perhaps Kyrie is ""better"" as you say, ok so he is.  AI played in a different era, where it was possible to play how he did and he crushed it.  But in sports, stats aren't everything.  There is no stat for Kyrie being a kook and teammates probably liking AI more or the fact Iverson had the balls to try to lead a team by himself against the likes of Kobe and Shaq, one of the most insane duos the L has ever seen, where as Kyrie needs 2 of the top 5-10 players in the league to team up with.  Iverson took a JV squad to the finals at the helm, Kyrie with the celts made the playoffs 1 out of two years and got bounced in the second rounds having baller teammates like, marcus smart, al horford, jayson tatum, jaylen brown plus a good coach.  Different players, different times.  Both hoopers.  Both got solid shoes too."
"As a Raptors fan in 2017, I remember being so happy the Celtics missed out on Josh Jackson and instead got mediocre Jayson Tatum.   I was very wrong."

"jayson ""the settler"" tatum"
Jayson Tatum has hit his ceiling
Jayson “The Charisma Killer” Tatum
"Donovan's efficiency this season is average for guards. Not good, not bad. Right in the middle. Certainly not elite. Numbers wise, he's slightly more efficient than Jayson Tatum and slightly less efficient than Jaylen Brown."
Is jayson Tatum considered an elite top 5 player?
"Just from that list of top 100 FTA/FGA, he's above Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, etc."
"If ESPN was really just trying to stir up contoversy, they would do something more drastic than leave out RJ Barrett. I think he genuinly just got left out. I was reffering to Jayson Tatum was put under Lamelo Ball"
"I realize that but RJ isnt even popular enough for it to cause any major controversy. Most fans know him from Duke and once he got drafted to the knicks, stopped caring about him. Hes not nearly famous enough for it to cause much outrage. The Jayson Tatum listing on the other hand would cause major outrage"
Jayson Tatum and turnovers
Jayson Tatum isn’t the first option on a championship caliber team.
4-8 year old Jayson Tatum
"Get a New point guard, and do better on defense.  Jayson Tatum take less hards shots"
Jaylen brown &gt; jayson Tatum In the long run
"Jayson tatums true shooting percentage is .562%    It's barely league average if that.    A list of players with better true shooting percentage   Embiid .647%  Jokic .647%  Giannis .631%  Zion .664%  Kawhi .620%  Jimmy .595%  Dame .618%  Luka .595%  Steph. 646%  Durant .652%  Kyrie .613%  LBJ .605%  AD .588%  Harden .616%  Beal .600%  KAT .608%  CJ .585%  Derozan .594%  Shai .623%  Lavine .602%  PG .609%  Tobias. 610%    Conclusion. Tatum is not one of the most efficient players in the league. Not even close. He is, in fact, inefficient and doesn't score enough for the amount of shots he takes. Furthermore tatum is 40th, thats right 40th in PER. He's become wildly overrated by this sub simply because he's popular. I'm not even tryna be a dick I just think it's absurd how overrated his offensive game is"
Jayson Tatum is 6'8 210 according to Google and I wouldn't say that he's skinny
"He’s already that player, every team could use him. What makes him really intriguing to me is how he’s expanding his game tremendously over the course of the season, and he honestly could take a Jayson Tatum esque leap"
Hey guys!!!! I found the Celtics troll that doesn’t know that Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown carried to the ECF last year.
Kemba missed over 20 games. Brown has been nursing a knee injury the entire season and clearly isn’t himself. Do you really think Julius Randle is a better player than Jayson Tatum?
I guess they were voting for Jayson Tatum

I've always felt like Jayson Tatum was an absolute star but I look at other guys around the league and their ability to facilitate and touch every part of the game and not just scoring and I don't know. I feel like Tatum is a guy I would want to put next to a max player especially if I want to win a championship. The ability to average 25 a game is great but there's a lot more to the game especially in the playoffs. Idk I think its the GM's job to set him up to win in the long run
"Jayson Tatum, I prefer star players who don't turn into Bismack Biyombo in the half court"
how the hell is this bad fit? It's Jayson Tatum not Tacko Fall
imagine making this post with jayson tatum and jaylen brown on your team lmao
jayson tatum is currently 2/9. Does that make him bad? No.
Jayson Tatum really took that L to heart
James Harden - Gojou Satoru (both cute)  Jayson Tatum - Phil from promised neverland  Damian Lillard - Roy Mustang  Blake Griffin - Kagami  Russell Westbrook - Bakugo   LeBron James - Ash Ketchum (really good but always loses when it matters)  Jerome Robinson/Kevin Knox - Brock (brock)  Ben Simmons - Rock Lee (talented)  Luka Doncic - Gaara (young prodigy)  Michael Jordan - Jiren (goated chad with hella game)  Steph Curry - Leorio
Jayson Tatum is 23 right now.  Jaylen Brown is 24.  Zion is 20.    so everyone's clocks are all fucked up by these guys.

"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive.

Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
Fucking bum how the fuck does a #1 overall draft pick get stage fright and forget how to play fucking basketball you dumb ugly haired bastard Jayson Tatum is going to cook us for the rest of his career and its all your fault all you had to do was not get so scared that you forget how to shoot you dumb chick-fil-a filled piece of shit you better remember how to play the sport you devoted your whole life to becoming a top prospect in you dipshit
"Indeed but I’d actually hate losing to the Small Dicks even more since we’re battling for playoff seeding with them, which is absolutely hilarious. We’re almost 3/4s through the season and Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown are looking up in the standings at Tommy Thibodeau, Julius Randle, and Reggie Bullock.   #BUCK FOSTON"

"Teague spent most of his minutes getting backpacked by Tatum in our Jayson+bench lineup.  He's every bit as bad as advertised, it's just that Tatum and Timelord have been good enough to make the rest of the bench look just regular awful instead of cataclysmically awful.  Tbh Jeff will probably look fine in Milwaukee too, now that he's got Giannis to carry him."

"I love Jayson Tatum, but I just don’t think he’s a number one option if we want to win a championship. He lacks the ability to finish around the rim and is not good at finishing through contact, and due to this, his efficiency isnt great because he is forced to settle for tough jumpers.  Hopefully he proves me wrong."
People’ve asked me once they’ve asked me a million times. Jayson Tatum is the most overrated player in the game

He was simply not better than Jayson Tatum last year
You know you can just say Jayson Tatum   We all know he's always been a little fetus
"Lol  Worst team in 2007, won championship in 2008.   Drafted Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.  Built a team of Kyrie, Jaylen, Hayward, Jayson, Horford, Smart, Marcus Morris, Rozier"
"Oh wow, look at little baby fetus Jayson Tatum."
"It's been a weird stretch, but over the course of the season it looks like he's been getting a decent amount of calls. He's #29 in FTA per game, #39 in FTA per 36 minutes, and #37 in FTA per 100 possessions. He's #70  in FTA/FGA per game at 0.258, which isn't great, but still better than some notable players like Deandre Ayron, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Jalen Brown and Jayson Tatum."
A team with 5 MVP level players should not be getting taken to 7 by Victor Oladipo and rookie Jayson Tatum lol
"Jayson Tatum since the All-Star Break: 4 wins, 8 losses"
Superstars play like superstars for 82 games. That's what makes them superstars and not lesser stars like Jayson Tatum

Luka Doncic is better at basketball than Jayson Tatum
"These are fair points but I still disagree. I think bandwagoning is tacky as hell and I think players forcing their way off of teams - because they can - is especially tacky. I find it dishonorable to basically decide not to honor your side of the deal - work hard and play your best. You might say some of these guys didn’t do that or it’s not fair to accuse them of it but... come on.   As for what I want them to do? Yea - I would like to see players do their damndest to win on the teams they are on, as long as they’re on those teams. I don’t think that’s unreasonable. And I’d love to see the NBA find a way to modify the rules (probably some combo of cap rules and max contracts but I’m not knowledgeable in the details) to make it harder for players to stack up ridiculous rosters out of nowhere like this.   I am glad in a way that some people enjoy watching something like this play out. I just personally find it to be a huge turnoff, largely because of the lack of continuity. I *enjoy* watching a team grow and progress and try to get over the hump. I think it’s great that I’ll hopefully be able to watch and root for Jayson Tatum for his whole career, even if that’s good years and bad. That’s part of sports!  By the way, if the players have all the power it’s not about waiting for the team to “pull their head out of their ass” - don’t you think every team would love to be able to recruit the superstar?? That’s what’s so silly about the whole thing. It’s not like the Bucks or someone wouldn’t want to add another star."
"It's crazy how those picks basically turned into Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Colin Sexton (who was traded for Kyrie Irving) and yet it is likely that the Nets will end up winning a title before the Celtics."
Harden and Westbrook were both reaches I think. Like KD was a no-brainer but those two picks are still impressive. Being able to actually evaluate top talent matters. Not being able to do so is how you end up taking Markelle Fultz over Jayson Tatum or Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic.
"Nah, Brooklyn has Durant coming off an ACL tear, Kyrie who has injury and personal issues, and Harden.  Unless you expect 36 yo Harden to be the reincarnation of MJ, those later picks will likely be half decent.  Also, if Harden leaves or can’t play for a bit in one season, then we might get a fluke season that nets us Jayson Tatum Jr."
Dunno what to say except Jayson Tatum existing got you so worked up you named your account after him. Is that soft?
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
"I mean BI has been more efficient by a solid amount both last year and this year. I don’t see how Tatum has a better offensive arsenal. BI is more efficient in [every zone except 20-24 ft](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=F&amp;StarterBench=Starters&amp;PlayerExperience=Veteran&amp;CF=AGE*LE*23) so unless Jayson Tatum practices extremely long twos, I don’t see anything Jayson Tatum has better than BI in terms of offensive moves."

Their best opportunity was last season before the Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown's extensions kick in. It's going to be harder to do roster construction from here on.
"It's Christian Wood, washed up John Wall, a guy that sounds like if a 5 year old tried to spell Jayson Tatum (he's actually pretty good tbf) and a bunch of G-Leaguers  Not counting KPJ in there obviously since he wasn't there when Harden was in Houston"
If we lose Jayson Tatum is going to throw all his subway sandwiches at us.

AD best scoring season: 28ppg on 61% TS  Zion right now: 26ppg on 67% TS   Just a massive gap efficiency wise. That 6% TS gap is like the gap between James Harden and Jayson Tatum.
"Jayson Tatum, Kawhi, Jordan, Kobe  The mid rangers make their games so pleasing and it’s undeniable"
"Sixers fan here, I just came to say how much I love Jayson Tatum  Hi, I’m new to basketball, why should I root for your team.  Oh, that’s a nice bit of well researched anecdotal evidence against my opinion, welp, in response to that all I have to say is fuck you I’m right  Yes Russell Westbrook is the best player in the league thank you very much for not asking  Hey how do you rank this list of 28 players that all play different positions and roles"
"Paul George is at the top of this list, followed by James Harden and Jayson Tatum"
"For sure.  I remember there being some people goofing on him when he was selected for the 3PT contest, but Tatum is a deadeye shooter from range despite his percentage being lower this year.  He shot 40% on 7 attempts last year, was shooting like 42% on 8 attempts per game pre-COVID, and has been back to pre-COVID level since the All Star Break.  I think a lot of people don't realize just how good of a shooter he is because he gets stuck with the inefficient label since everyone just cares about true shooting now.  But his TS% woes come from drawing a disproportionately low amount of fouls for the amount of times he drives to the basket (last time I checked he was top 20 in drives per game and drew the second lowest amount of fouls behind I think Curry), and because he takes a shitload of awful bailout mid range shots since he has to spend a good part of every game as literally the only scoring option on the floor surrounded by our trash bench.  There are very few players I'd rather have taking a three with the game on the line than Jayson."
"Lol.   You had Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on your team, signed an all star in Gordon Hayward, then traded for Kyrie Irving all while still having a decent abundance of assets.   If issues and injuries didn’t get in the way, you could have had a team with 4 elite top 20 talents."
Breaking: sources tell me Jayson Tatum and Jayken Brown were traded today for Lamelo Ball

LeBron also has a pretty excellent bag of tricks but it feels like he has relied so much on being bigger, stronger &amp; faster than everyone to get to his spots it's not as flashy as some of the other guys on this list."
Jayson Tatum will leave the Celtics as soon as he possibly can.
"Just imagine how good this team is if we could get (and I know this is a silly thing to say because you can’t just go pick up a superstar) a Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Paul George type guy.

Jayson hasn't quite been enough. You can bench Marcus Smart while he's cold and cobble together something. You can't bench Tatum while he's cold
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum both need to become more consistent scorers.
Recency bias but Jayson Tatum for Markelle Fultz.
Celtics team: \*gets a 4-on-3 fast break\*  Jayson Tatum: \*takes on all 3 defenders by himself\*  also Jayson Tatum: \*makes the bucket\*
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"Just as i suspected, Jayson Tatum isn't even a top 5 player on his own team. Grant Williams is the clearly better Power Forward."
Everyone is older than Jayson Tatum. Jayson Tatum’s children are older than Jayson Tatum.
He’s older than Jayson Tatum
"2017: Sacramento loses out on Jayson Tatum, selects De'Aaron Fox (albeit in a timeline where Sacramento has their first Boston probably selects Tatum #1 and Sacramento still takes Fox or even Markelle Fultz)  2019: Boston selects Romeo Langford  Honestly as far as bad trades go, they got off pretty easy."
AD is like the Jayson Tatum of bigs. He settles for way too many mid range/deep jumpers where Embiid bangs and gets closer to the rim more often for better looks.
I wasn't a believer in either the Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum picks at the time of their drafts.  Brown I was *sure* would bust. He was so raw and had terrible advanced stats at Cal. Tatum struck me as an old-fashioned player too inefficient for the modern game. The kind of player that would score points but not contribute to winning basketball.  Very happy to be wrong on both counts.
Jayson Tatum is a one-dimensional player and will never win a title
Russell Westbrook is the Best PG since Magic Johnson.  Jaylen Brown has more potential than Jayson Tatum.  Kevin Durant is the GOAT 2nd fiddle.   Porzingis is the most predictable player in the NBA. Second is Carmelo  Giannis is more dominant than SHAQ
Jaylen Brown has a higher ceiling than Jayson Tatum
Honestly Jayson Tatum is overrated.
"Ray Allen should have won Finals MVP in 2008.  Lebron should have won Finals MVP in 2015, if not him, Curry.  Jaylen Brown is a better all around player than Jayson Tatum."
"then who is the better option we should be listening to that has as wide a presence as Kanter???? Beggars can’t be choosers, if you care about the way people are being mistreated then you can’t be picky about the people drive the issue.   That’s like saying fuck what MLK said, let’s wait until we have someone who doesn’t cheat on their wife to spread the message of equality.   It’s not like there is  or some other high profile athlete that’s speaking out on China that we should be listening to instead. If somebody like CJ McCollum or Jayson Tatum or Jerami Grant started saying the exact same thing as Kanter, then that’d be great, but in the meantime, Kanter is the only one pushing back.  Is it unfortunate that Kanter may be colleagues with some of those people? Yes (but also wtf they’re only pictures, Kanter could’ve met those guys for like 2 minutes. Even Ali is pictured with guys Bush and Clinton, Jackie Robinson was “friends” with Nixon). Everybody fucking loved Obama even though he also killed thousands of innocent people with drone strikes.   If we start calling people guilty by association then every single notable person will be guilty. Like what the fuck are we doing.   Kanter being a Gulenist is atrocious, but we also haven’t heard him talk about that at all recently (or at least I haven’t, if you do know of any podcasts/articles/etc of him talking about Gulen I’d be interested to hear/read them)"
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Jayson Tatum will be a better player than Luka by the end of their careers
"I’ve heard Kobe being Top 3 even before his death because he has a lot of fans/players who look up to him + there are a lot of Lakers fans.  Most objective people didn’t have him Top 3 before or after death, so don’t worry lol.  Did Jayson tatum say that?"

"In other news, the demise of Jayson Tatum and Jalen Green was greatly overstated."
Why nobody saying Jayson Tatum????
"I think Jayson *could* be a top 5 player in his prime, but I see him having a PG like career but slightly better. Tatum is a slightly better scorer than PG, but other than that, their games are pretty damn similar. He'll have a few years being a MVP candidate, but IMO, he'll be mostly a top ~10-15 player."
Only answer is Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum is an insanely elegant shooter.
Jayson Tatum
"You’re looking at it a little too simply.   The triangle suppressed Kobe’s (and Jordan’s) ability to get hella assists. So getting more assists in the triangle than Tatum is a testament of the playmaking difference already. But there’s more:  Kobe, in his prime, had multiple years with an adjusted turnover rate that was &lt; 8%. Tatum, in these last 2 years, has an adjusted turnover rate of 10.1%. Tatum is much sloppier with the ball when you account for their offensive loads.   Kobe’s highest recorded passer rating was a 7.3. Jayson Tatum has a passer rating of 4.8 in these last 2 years. He has ways to go to be the passer Kob was.  Also, Tatum didn’t have anywhere that level of gravity that Kobe had.  Tatum is one of the best players in the league. Super versatile . Maybe he catches some BS criticism for his playmaking, but he’s still notably behind the level he has to be at. The sky is the ceiling for him. He’s young and I imagine he will develop his playmaking and be in MVP conversations one day"
"Surprised no one’s said Jayson Tatum but he’s up there, PG and LaVine also"
"&gt;*Must be nice to keep getting first overall picks and generational players*   &gt;   &gt;*With that attitude, you guys are definitely moving to Seattle*  IDK there have been some really great picks not chosen at #1.  KD, Giannis, Dame, Steph, PG, Kawhi, Jokic, Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Luka, Trae, Lavine, Spida, Kobe, Booker.  Maybe there's more to life than draft order."
"""You fool. Haven't you realized that I can boom you from anywhere?""  Tatum's thin smile was unnerving. Anxiously, Nicole thanked him for his time, excused herself and turned to leave - only to be confronted by 3 identical copies of Jayson Tatum.  ""I'm that good"" they chanted in unison, their smiles morphing into maniac grins  Nicole Yang was never seen again"
"This trade has been floated for [years](https://www.nj.com/sixers/2019/05/nba-rumors-ben-simmons-for-jayson-tatum-exploring-sixers-celtics-trade-suggested-by-bill-simmons.html).

Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
Those are Jayson Tatum numbers
combined they still had a better shooting record than jayson Tatum
I think they snuck a current picture of Jayson Tatum in there
Well it’s Jayson Tatum JR but he calls him Deuce
Damn but so is Jayson Tatum and look how well he’s playing
"He’s an incredible playmaker are you fucking kidding me?  He had RJ Barrett on him and he’s Jayson fucking Tatum, you let him do his thing and see what happens."
Yeah I can't believe people actually think Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum are good players too
Its one game. See Jayson Tatum.   OGs shot looked a lot better in the 4th. Lets wait and see atleast 2 games before we think we know everything lol.
"Yeah. That was the hardest part to watch. The shots he actually made were, like, long fadeaway 2's. When Jaylen was on fire early, the Knicks started scrambling and the ball found Jayson fucking Tatum completely wide open for three on like 5+ occasions. He just kept missing them."

"Mediocre Scottie Barnes highlights such as? His first NBA basket? That's your mediocre highlight? Better get on Rockets fan cause there is a highlight of Jalen Greens first NBA bucket on here! You seem to have also forgot posts hitting front page of rookie Tatum doing banal things like hitting a basic corner three off a kick out.  And Tatum was actually good? Yeah, duh, he is Jayson Tatum he was good as a rookie. But I guess based on one NBA game in his career so far you are going with the ""Scottie Barnes is not actually good"" angle huh. And why wouldn't Scottie Barnes posts be posted by fans of the team he is on? The same way rookie Tatum posts were all Celtics fans or Caruso and THT posts were all Lakers fans. Mans is really clueless af."
"As a Knicks fan, I hate that Jaylen and Jayson are on the Celtics but pre draft I always rated Tatum highly and loved how much mature and hardworking Jaylen was. Both deserved their all stars and they’ll be scary good year by year"
This is who Jayson Tatum is as a player. He'll have games like this but he'll also turn up and drop 55 and you're like wow wtf. Needs to fix the consistency issues a bit.
He saw Jaylen Brown star shine bright so Jayson Tatum made it his mission to ruin JB career night
And Jayson Tatum shot them right out of it
Jayson Tatum hates Jaylen Brown
"If Jayson Tatum just recognizes “hey, not my night. Let me pass to JB because he’s prime Tracy McGradu right now” the Celtics win this game comfortably. Some selfish ass hero ball cost them"
"Just being realistic, Jayson Tatum isn't going to go 5-20 twice in a row."
Jayson Tatum doesn't want Jaylen Brown to shine. He has ruined Jaylen Brown career night deliberately.
"I was walking down the street of New York when I heard gunshots! Turned out, it was jayson tatum shooting jump shots at MSG. Shame on you, JT!"
"Jayson ""Westbrick"" Tatum"
Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum
"Of all the problems a basketball team could half, Jayson Tatum shooting good shots ranks very low."
jayson tatum but then he threw em up
Jayson Tatum trying to make it in Real Estate brickerage
"Jayson Tatum gets in his own head which causes him to have games of 3/17, and he lets the missed foul calls upset him to much. He gets wacked a lot but doesnt flop so he hasnt gotten many whistles but still he needs to keep focused."
"Imagine seeing Jayson Tatum need fucking inhalers for months after getting Covid and thinking, ""nah, I don't need this vaccine."""
u gonna have to change your flair to say  &gt;[LAL] Jayson Tatum  when he becomes a free agent
"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.   Looking at all +24ppg scorers ≤25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up. If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
"Giannis joined Larry Bird and Lebron James as the only players to average 25/10/5 in a single postseason while winning the title.   Fun fact - only one other player has put up that stat line while also winning at least two rounds in a single postseason, and that player was Jayson Tatum in 2019-20."
Because jayson tatum is good for &lt;enter middle school age&gt; and “Lebron and AD scissoring” are so much more funnier.   All those repeated ass jokes suck.
"I thought he deserved it, but just barely. He played 45/72 games. That's 51 games over an 82 game season. Had he missed *any* more time, it would be hard to give him the nod over guys like Jayson Tatum."
Jayson Tatum about to teach the NBA world what true PAIN is
All-Fuck-Simmons 1st Team  Trae Young | Kevin Huerter | Kawhi Leonard | Jayson Tatum | Joel Embiid
Is that what they're calling Jayson Tatum now?
"Give Jordan Poole 5”, now we have our own Jayson Tatum   Give the last inch to Steph"
Paul George is better than Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum
"Jalen Brown, Jayson Tatum, three FRP, 2 pick swaps"
"I will intentionally mis-interpret this to understand that in 9 years, Jayson Tatum will be the fourth best player on a small market team that will clinch its first championship in several decades.  Am I doing this right?"
"James harden, giannis, Kyrie Irving,  kawhi Leonard, Joel embiid, Kevin Durant, Luka doncic, jayson Tatum, Jimmu butler, Paul George, jokic, Chris Paul, lillard   The list can go on and on"
"* Haliburton's play falls off a cliff. * Lakers are the 2 seed but a second round exit * Sixers play better with Tyrese Maxey starting at point guard than with Ben * De'Aaron Fox All-Star * Nets don't make it past the ECF, again * Bucks play badly to start the season, end up with the 4th seed but go to the Finals again * The Nuggets make it to the Finals * Jayson Tatum MVP"
"I can’t help but feel a big part of this is how much star power / talent is in the league today.   Pace is up, efficiency is up and scoring is up - no doubt. But even when you account for all these increases it doesn’t quite explain the top scorers averages being this much higher. And honestly I think a big part of the reason for that is someone like jayson Tatum being the 10th highest scorer. In other eras I think he’d be much higher on the list but there is just so much talent today."
I really want Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum to be a thing
"PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: OG Anunoby  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo/Anthony Davis  C: Anthony Davis/Giannis Antetokounmpo   Bench: Ben Simmons, Brook Lopez, Klay Thompson(obviously expecting him to be the player he once was)  Size, Switching, Secondary options if AD gets hurt and none of these guys are liabilities from the line in close games besides Simmons so I don't have to take them out. Should be the best team in the NBA."
i'd have to go with Jayson Tatum and Donovan Mitchell
Definitely. Both drafted in 2017 too. Collins has played 2.6k minutes in 154 games. Isaac has played 3.5k minutes in 136 games. For comparison Jayson Tatum leads the class with 289 games and about 9.5k minutes.

Jayson Tatum MVP

Steph with the Jayson Tatum statline 🤢
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are darkhorse candidates. Horford isn’t close to the discussion of even being a darkhorse
Jayson Tatum
"Because there are easily 3 western conference teams playing ball as good or better when they’re supposed to be title favorites. Not to mention they haven’t necessarily created separation from an Eastern Conference field they should have even without Kyrie Irving. The Bucks came out the gate hobbled, the Sixers are an up and down mess but they’re gonna be better once Embiid is fully back in the fold, Jayson Tatum has been his worst self to start this year for the Celtics, the Heat have been a litmus test team like the Jazz while you know they can perform in the postseason and are still learning how to play with Lowry.  This nets team being a 1 seed *is* the bare minimum. And we have 0 evidence to indicate that Kyrie is gonna get the jab and return them to superteam status this year. We’re calling them a mess because they are a mess. The most talented mess in the league, but a mess."

"Well then I don’t know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren’t good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we’ve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they’re at risk of a shot clock violation."
Awww shit. I’m way too invested in Jayson Tatum.

Imagine being Marcus Smart and having to talk to Jayson Tatum everyday
Marcus Smart and I guess Jayson Tatum as of now are getting shredded by Celtics fans
"Here's the thing: Jaylen Brown can be the 2nd best player on a title team. Jayson Tatum has the allure of a star, but is really a hyped up Zach LaVine."
"I just posted this in the Celtics sub  &gt;I don't wanna pile up on Jayson or continue a circlejerk; that said - this team's identity is playing team ball, every single player is ready to contribute when we play team ball. And Tatum is just literally isoing and slowing everything down.  &gt;The evil dumbass voice in my head saying we need to swap him for a better pick is showing up way too often this season."
"If you think Brad Stevens was a good coach and that Ime Udoka is a coach with potential, the only logical person to blame is Jayson Tatum. By the way, he is also the reason Jaylen Brown is requesting a trade in approximately 13 months."
Jayson Tatum is kind of overrated at this point but I think people are catching on more now
"&gt;Though I guess it's not hard when you get so many assets back lol  Got them James Young, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kyrie.  2 out of 4 is pretty good for guys not in your future."
"Jayson Tatum - Jayson Tantrum, Temper Tatum  Hopefully JT stops complaining to the refs so much and outgrows these nicknames."
We have quite a few:  Grant Williams  Marcus Smart  Jayson Tatum(to some extent)
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
"Judging by r/bostonceltics recently, it’s Jayson Tatum."
The Celtics and Jayson Tatum are mediocre.

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1.

"I mean, I think Jayson Tatum is worth a little more than FC Barcelona B shooting guard Kyle Kuric."
The Celtics are whack af. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on the team yet this is the quality of basketball they put forth.
"Of course Jayson Tatum wants the Celtics to lose, he’s a Lakers fan"
"""Jayson Tatum should force his way to another Eastern Conference team"" - Eastern Conference exec"
"Giannis faced kevin durant on Opening Night and beat him in that game. I know it is a regular season game but Kevin Durant has an MVP player in James harden while giannis has khris Middleton. In my opinion, Giannis is better because if you look at his teammates none of them are in the top 10 player list in the NBA both lebron and kd has anthony davis and james harden. Im not trying to disrespect khris Middleton but the man is inconsistent imagine if giannis had a top 10 player that fits his playing style that is consistent like jayson tatum who is close to being top 10 nobody in the east or NBA is beating the bucks. Giannis can carry a team better kevin durant needs MVP and all star caliber players on his team to succeed"
"Yeah, *but* an Eastern Conference assistant coach said Jayson Tatum is about Jayson Tatum, and that *he* doesn't think Jayson Tatum cares about winning now.   That's gotta count for more, right?"
"Welcome to the last three years of Ben and Joel's four year partnership. If Jayson Tatum isn't Jaylen Brown's absolute best friend, and vice versa, then this will continue until they either are separated or they win a title (I assume)."
Yup. Only three and a half months ago. [https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/jaylen-brown-jayson-tatum-celebrate-team-usas-olympic-gold-medal](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/jaylen-brown-jayson-tatum-celebrate-team-usas-olympic-gold-medal)
"The Lakers will have approximately two bad years and then in 2025 they'll be, like, Zion Williamson, Kawhi Leonard, and Jayson Tatum. The fans won't complain. They will just be like ""see, people always want to come to LA."" And they will be right."
"Jayson Tatum does too much outside of basketball. He's completely exhausted himself, and it's obvious. The guy probably falls asleep getting dressed after the game. In this case if he's the last guy out, then that's probably not a great thing. I don't blame him for wanting the bag, but I do believe he wants the bag over the ring. I'm still rooting for his ass as my fave player on the team, and I'd trade every last man on the team before him. I also don't see him as the type of guy who would say me or JB. Me or Marcus well sure."
&gt;They've looked like [players that] legitimately don't enjoy each other's success  FOH there's literally a picture of Jaylen and Jayson partying together the day Tatum came back from Japan and Jaylen is holding the gold medal smiling like a madman!
"As if there's something wrong about ""Jayson Tatum is about Jayson Tatum"".   The teams never sacrifice for the players. Why should players sacrifice for the team?   It's just business."
"&gt;Jayson Tatum is about Jayson Tatum  Yes, that is how being a person works"
"""I heard, Jayson Tatum called Marcus Smart am ugly poopy pants.""  These gossip headlines citing unnamed sources are something else, man. Can literally just make up what they want, claim it's an opinion of someone with credibility who may have 0 access or close knowledge, if they exist at all, and pass it off as newsworthy."
You missed Tyrese Maxey and Tyler Herro being ranked over Jayson Tatum and Trae Young
"&gt; Now that the season is underway, the latest version and others during the season will function as more of a ranking **based on how they're playing at the moment.** Big stars with slow starts (Trae Young, Jayson Tatum) will get some benefit of the doubt, but even those names fell a few spots.   Still a bad list IMO, but with that context in mind it’s not the worst list ever"
"They did it with him but he wasn’t a starter or a key piece. Kuzma gave you 10 inefficient ppg and basically nothing else during their playoff run. Rondo was running the offense while LeBron sat and Caldwell-Pope, Caruso and Dwight Howard were playing strong defense. But the Lakers this year are trying to turn Tucker into a starter and a key piece and I do not see that working if they want to make a playoff run. They should trade him for an NBA vet who has more experience. And they should have done the same with Kuzma when he was being compared to Jayson Tatum early on. It would be crazy to make that same mistake again."
"""Drafted well"" or have been drafting at the top of the lottery for quite a bit? I think they'd be looked at as more successful talent evaluators if they took Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown instead of Lonzo/Ingram. Caruso was undrafted.  I'll give some credit to the later rounders (add Kuz, THT, Zubac) but Randle, D-Lo, Lonzo, Ingram, etc. were good picks but had much higher expectations given where they were taken and overshadowed by the success of players taken a little after them like Lavine, Booker, Brown, Tatum... But at least they didn't go Jahlil Okafor or trade into the #1 spot to take Fultz."
"&gt;CHA: Lamelo, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington &amp; a 1st  &gt;BOS: Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart &amp; Al Horford   &gt;PHX: Booker &amp; Ayton  Those are the only teams I see with good enough assets and Luka brings his winning style of basketball to these teams."
Tatum's kids real name is Jayson Tatum. Deuce is just a nickname
"There isn’t a consensus, and would depend more on whom you would be getting in the transaction / rest of the team.    Jayson has a higher ceiling but is less of a natural leader - will take home time to get there (much like how both Pierce &amp; Kobe were not natural leaders for some time).  Jaylen seems more fit for that, but his ceiling is a little lower.  There’s recency bias though; Brown has been amazing and Tatum has slumped at the beginning of the season - but that looks turned around.  The probably correct answer is keep Tatum.  The most natural pairing &amp; hardest role to fill would be a top PF/C. Tatum can play PF, but when he does Boston can be a little undersized. There’s a reason Danny Ainge lusted after AD, and why we’re especially furious that LA &amp; Paul tampered their way into that one sided trade while both Boston &amp; Portland had superior offers for him.  I digress.  I mean, the most gettable star that fits that description is KAT.  I think there’s a world where we don’t have to give up either to get him, but if we do I still don’t think it’s obvious of whom would be a better pairing with him."
"I want Jayson Tatum to flame out in Boston because the Celtics so obviously won the Markelle Fultz trade with my Sixers. Basic, I know."
"Jaylen Brown is a saint, I love that man. Jayson Tatum can go cry in a corner, always complaining to the refs, always pushing off, thinks he’s basketball Jesus. Can’t stand Tatum."
Anthony Davis  Giannis Jokic  Jayson Tatum Zion if healthy (not lookin likely but still) Ja Morant  Joel Embiid  Lamelo Ball Anthony Edwards Deandre Ayton  Evan Mobley  Emoni Bates  Bronny Jr Victor Wembayana  These are just the standout talents of you told me they are going to be the best player in the world I can clearly see why   What is Luka’s why?
"This is not a petty take (or even a hot one on this subreddit), but I honest to god believe Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum because Brown has consistently proved he’s willing to improve and play around his team"

“Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown can’t play together”
Jayson Tatum being so effective despite being 1-9 from 3 is really good to see
"That feels about right if you think of him as a big, although it's worth mentioning that Webber was only an inch or so taller than Jayson Tatum, and had a similar desire to play away from the basket even though it's maybe not playing to their strengths.   Compared to Tatum, I like Webber's defense, passing, and BBIQ more, but his shooting is much worse. So maybe in the modern era Webber sees himself even more like a wing. (I mean, KD doesn't really see himself as a 4 in the ideal situation, either). That is not playing to his strengths. If you think of him as a large wing, it's a little harder to slot him in. Is he better than Tatum?   Last year, the forwards who made all NBA were Giannis, Kawhi, Randle, LeBron, Butler, and PG. KD, obviously, is dislodging one of those guys, but Randle seems to have fallen off and Kawhi won't make it this year.   So if you think of him as a forward, this season, KD, Giannis and PG are ahead of him, I think he's part of a scrum that includes Randle, Butler, Tatum, Brown, AD (who maybe gets in as a C) and LeBron - you're talking six or 7 guys (unless I'm forgetting someone?) for three all-NBA slots. Webber's right on the cusp.   So, clearly an all-star, but borderline all-NBA depending on how a given year shakes out."

Literally every single team in the league wants a Jayson Tatum
"So you're telling me the last four years weren't a fluke, and Jayson Tatum is actually a wonderful young talent and one of the better scorers in the league? Huh who would have guessed..."
The demise of Jayson Tatum was greatly exaggerated
Jayson Tatum is back  No Jaylen Brown or Rob Williams and they still blew 'em out
The demise of Jayson Tatum was greatly exaggerated
wait did they just say jayson tatum grew up being a lakers and kobe fan? no way
Jayson Tatum is back
JAYSON TATUM
I really wish Jayson Tatum wore any other colors besides Green and White. Kid's a beast.
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown:  A combined 51/13/8 with 5.4 turnovers on 57.8% TS and 58.6% TS respectively  Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo:  40/16/12 with 4.8 turnovers on 60.1% TS and 62.6% TS respectively, with better defense.   Scoring at high volume isnt everything guys, Bam and Jimmy generate the same amount of offense with better efficiency, rebounding, and defense."
No Jaylen? Jayson at 17?? Zion (who doesn’t play defense and has never been in a playoff series) at 13??? Chris Paul at 12 seems super weird also. I imagine most Suns fans would take Tatum over him without flinching.  Who wrote this?
"Ironic statement about a guy who averages the most assists in the league and has less of a usage rate then Luka, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving Damian Lillard, and about 10 other guys."
You know super athletes like Jayson Tatum and Myles Garrett had a really bad go of it? Just because a few of your mates got off easy doesn't mean you won't end up with longer term health problems. Look at the entire population not just anecdotal evidence.
"Maybe he should talk to Jayson Tatum about how COVID can fuck up your lungs, then, even for a young athlete in prime physical condition.  Being ""careful about your body"" is *all the more reason to get fully vaccinated the millisecond you can*."
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
"Funny thing about small percentages of big numbers, eventually they get to be real world numbers. Covid has killed over 2k Americans under 30, and made many many times that suffer miserably, including healthy people like Jayson Tatum."
"Okay but if Jayson Tatum is so good, why isn’t there a Jayson Tatum 2 yet?  Wait... you’re telling me that his son’s name is Jayson Tatum, Jr.? Fuck me."
"Except the play-in is also part of this set schedule to prove you should qualify for the playoffs that you're holding so sacred, and every single player in the NBA knew that before the preseason started.  Not having a Play-In is a kick in the face to teams that had early covid related losses.  You know what else is unfair?  Russell Westbrook and Jayson Tatum not having their lungs back to pre-covid condition before the regular season started.  I don't see Lebron standing up for the Celtics and Wizards to get their fair shake though, weird how he only cares about the thing that hurts the Lakers..."
"I think the early findings for the newest mRNA vaccines suggest vaccinated people are very unlikely to transmit the disease if exposed.   Even if that were not the case and the vaccine only protects you,  you'd think LeBron would have looked around the league at what covid did to his peers to see the very real consequences of catching the disease. Let's not talk about wanting to protect others, just selfishly consider what it could do to him. Young uber athletic Jayson Tatum was huffing and puffing his way on the court for a good half season before finally getting into full game shape just now. His new teammate Evan Fournier talked about being in a brain fog from the disease. Young Blazer Nassir Little lost like 25 pounds and felt like he was going to die for weeks during the summer and missed the beginning of the season from his own bout.  The severe effects of covid are very much real and even now with one of the best vaccination drives in the world we are still seeing 50k cases a day. Tatum probably has some mild scarring in his lungs given how long it took him to recover. Compared with the theoretical at best risks from the vaccine? Should be a no brainer.   Any reason James has against the vaccine is purely irrational. It's a free country though and he can decline the vaccine. I look forward to the pikachu face avalanche on social media if he gets knocked out for 2 weeks right as the Lakers are scraping for that last playoff spot though!"
"The amount of dumb takes in this thread are making my nose bleed.  The Celtics have good talent on their team - they’re having a rough year where their best player and pretty much everyone else has gotten COVID (and that dude is matching records made by Larry Fucking Bird just this week). They’ve experienced significant talent drain at a variety of positions and are filling them out with rookies (some performing admirably, some not). They’ll suck this year and try and figure it out the next.  I wanna know who all of these GMs are that would do a better job than Ainge at constructing this team. PP and Nesmith look like good picks. Robert Williams looks like a fucking steal. Jayson Tatum may be one of the best draft moves of all time. Jaylen Brown is also great. Sorry we don’t have the location pull of a Brooklyn or New York.  Ainge and Stevens are here to stay. We’re gonna win a ton of games. And if for some reason one of them gets fired around 25-27 other teams will be climbing over eachother to sign them. Peace out."
"He left but maybe you can give us the next best thing, Jayson Tatum"

Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum deserves so much better than someone like Jaylen Brown.  Jaylen Brown is an embarrassment to the Celtics jersey and he should be embarrassed he even considered himself to be Tatum's equal. Aaron Nesmith showed more hustle and heart in one game last game than Brown did for the entire season. But we all know Brown is going to make some feel-good PR message after the game so green teamers will forgive him.  Brown needs to personally apologize to Jayson Tatum and the rest of the team at the very minimum. I hope Danny Ainge trades him in the off-season.
Jaylen Brown clearly jealous of Jayson Tatum and is trying to be the overtime hero - terrible basketball IQ
They failed to consider Jayson Tatum
How many undersized guards can Jayson Tatum bring back?
"Celtics: [chucking bricks every shot]  Jayson Tatum Sr.: Fine, I'll do it myself."

The only hole would be if teams tried to go big and attack Tatum, but that would almost definitely cause more problems for them trying to cover Tatum than it would for the Celtics since Tatum could easily beat almost any PF big enough to create a mismatch and could honestly still probably hold his own defensively."
You're comparing Lonzo Ball (who turned out to be a pretty good player) and Jayson Tatum vs. Kobe and Todd Fuller though
Hindsight is 20/20 every single time. Why did the lakers take lonzo ball over jayson tatum? Nobody drafts perfectly.
I’m still not sure the Celtics understand that Jaylen Brown is as good as Jayson Tatum.
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
"Jayson and Jaylen were absolutely not top-3 consensus picks tf?  Jaylen was #9 on the draft board and Tatum was around 5. Also Terry Rozier, Robert Williams III, Pritchard, etc.  They definitely deserve lots of credit."
"""Jayson Tatum"" is just a laundering front"
He’s best friends with Jayson Tatum and the two used to walk to school together every morning. Beal called playing with Tatum in the all-star team and being in a team with him for the first time a “blessing”
So much for being the next Jayson Tatum LOL
"I mean on paper, he was exactly what all teams are looking for.  Long athletic wing with a strong frame who had a respectable shot.  Work in progress, but then what 19 year old isn't.  In fact, Knox got tons of Jayson Tatum comparisons heading into that draft.  They weren't graded wildly different, Tatum just seemed a bit more polished.  The pick was completely defensible at the time.  He just turned out to be way more clueless at the NBA level than anyone expected."

I’d say jayson Tatum but idk if hes 18 yet
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.  And Aaron Nesmith.
"Trae, Jayson Tatum, Adebayo, Lamello, Edwards, would be my guess but idk if its that unexpected.  These might be a stretch but theres also Tyrese, Pat Will, Ingram, Wiseman, Killian, and Fox"
Why is Jayson Tatum not an option to be picked because you 100% of the time take Jayson Tatum with Embiid and Simmons over any of the other pickups
Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum will be out of the league in 4 years after not being able to shoot over 30% from the field for 2 consecutive seasons
"I think superstars are the top 11-12 players in the league who could be a first option on a championship team. Lebron, KD, Steph, kawhi, Harden, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Dame, Ad, and Luka. Stars are guys just below that who are better suited as second options on a championship team like Kyrie, PG, Russ, CP3, Beal. All stars are at their best when they’re third options like Jrue, Vucevic, Conley, and Middleton. Jayson Tatum, Trae, Zion, Dbook, Lavine, Ja, and Shai are all too young imo to be rated on this scale yet. They could all end up being superstars, or all stars, or somewhere in between."
Jayson Tatum is top 10
"They hate Kyrie cuz he was a flop and he lied to them about wanting to stay. If you have the memory to go 2 years back you’ll remember that the cities favorite player Isaiah Thomas, was black. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett all are black. No they don’t hate Kylie cuz he’s black they hate him cuz he ditched them."
"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"
Jayson Tatum wins the MVP
Hm. Young and healthy but a covid long hauler like Jayson Tatum. Or young and healthy but lost six family members like KAT
"Hell, you had Warriors fans insisting that LeBron's block was goaltending, and there's a lot more to work with here, visually. I'd feel a similar urge if something had happened to Jayson Tatum. There was obviously no foul on Jrue's steal, but if viewed through fan-o-vision you can hallucinate one with little difficulty."
"Jerami Grant yelled, “There we go!” Draymond Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Jayson Tatum belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Keldon Johnson hit the locker room door, ex-USA Olympic star Carmelo Anthony hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
jayson tatum is so streaky and inconsistent.
Why has Jayson Tatum struggled so much with Team USA?
"the only irrelevant information is the hypothetical bs you seem to be playing. if jayson tatum averaged 120 points a game the celtics sweep the nets, but that’s not the case, so who cares?   the nets didn’t beat milwaukee, no other “what if” scenario matters."
"Come on blazers FO, Kuz has as much potential as Jayson Tatum. Please dame for kuz straight up please??"
The top 5 is exclusively Jayson Tatum
"Jayson Tatum is a woman. A beautiful, strong independent woman..."
lmao alright Jayson Tatum being trans truther
"I hate to say this, but Jayson Tatum would be doing this too...with length and defense."
People don’t talk about how erratic Booker has been his whole career. He’s great but has had a tendency to completely disappear. Reminds me of Jayson Tatum before he figured it out.
"Jrue ""Jayson Tatum"" Holiday"
He just turned into Jayson Tatum
"OKC are a dynasty as their draft picks have panned out.  Boston Celtics win at least one ring during this 5 year span.  Jayson Tatum, Giannis and Luka are the consensus top 3 in the league. Jokic and Trae round out the top 5z   Minnesota return to their spooky status but fail to be anything more just like last time.   Hawks are contenders but never manage to make the finals.  Mavs surround Luka with a solid #2 and win a ring in this time span."
That dude could be Jayson Tatum for all we know.
"Miami heat are in first place and Boston are a close second. Detroit is in third.  Cade Cunningham finishes second in MVP voting.  Jayson Tatum wins MVP for the second time in a row.   Lebron retires halfway through the season on a shitty team, Possibly on the cavs  Kawhi Leonard hasn’t won since 2019.  Lebron hasn’t won since 2020.  Giannis has a god awful season. With 20% ftm, 35% FG and looks slow.  🤷‍♂️"
"Jayson Tatum turns 20, Ben Simmons wins ROY on the Blazers"
Those flamin hot bbq ruffles with jayson tatum on the bag are hella good
"Hold on he isn’t Jayson Tatum here, Keldon isn’t 12 years old"
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
Jayson Tatum plugged his ruffles chips a couple times as well but nobody gave him shit or made his AMA a hot flaming shit show
"If we win a championship, Jayson Tatum will never leave Boston, because generally, stars that win championships with their homegrown team don't leave.   The best way to win a championship is to accumulate top end talent and then surround them with quality role players. We've already got one All-NBA player in Tatum. What's better than one All-NBA player? Two.   Yeah, there's a risk that we never win a championship while Dame and JT are under contract and Tatum could walk. But the odds that we do with those 2 are much higher than they are right now over the next 4 years as things presently stand, barring an unlikely injection of talent, and that's coming from somebody who is really excited for next year's team and thinks we have a legitimate chance to make it out of the East."
"One of our shittiest years was also when we were led by Jaylen and Jayson.  And I'd disagree -- there was no ""building around"" IT or Kemba. IT was like hitting the lottery -- they didn't draft and trade to build the team around him, he was just in the perfect place at the perfect time, hitting his peak with a coach who got him. Kemba was an added piece. The only PG we arguably tried to build around was Kyrie, and it obviously failed. But for the most part, what has remained consistent with the team-building philosophy is sticking with guys they draft -- Brown, Tatum, and all the rest of the bench garbage they overvalue."
Luka  Giannis  Donavan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae   Honorable mention:  Jokic  Embiid  Zion definitely up in the top 5 if he stays healthy
Don Cheadle was actually Jayson Tatum the whole time
"the players left (as I read it are)  Jayson Tatum, Dame, Draymond Green, KD, Bam, and Zach LaVine"
"Yet Dame/CJ got to the WCF, so what could a Dame/Beal squad do on an Eastern conference team? Plus if they team up in a market like NYC, Jayson Tatum will probably force his way there eventually too plus ringchasers"
JAYSON TATUM SO HELP ME GOD DO NOT TALK TO A SINGLE OTHER PLAYER UNLESS YOU ARE DOING THE RECRUITING!
1. Luka Doncic 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jayson Tatum 4. Zion Williamson 5. Paolo Banchero
have u ever heard of this guy from st louis named jayson tatum?
"Please don't be a delusional Dubs fan spouting superlatives like this...  I'd take KD, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, OG Anunuby, Khris Middleton and Jaylen Brown immediately, as well as a healthy Kawhi and Lebron, but it's unlikely any of them are available. I'd also highly consider Nic Batum, Tobias Harris, Micheal Porter, and Harry Barnes  Wiggs is good enough and important to fill a specific role on the GSW, and he's vital to holding on to that max salary slot for trade purposes.  But he'll always be an overpaid #1 pick with significant limitations. The lack of ball handling and passing vision/BBIQ, poor FT shooting, poor rebounding, and generally bad shot selection all contribute to being an average player who has always been net-negative by BPM, RPM, RAPTOR, etc."
Tobias Harris?!? But they already have jayson Tatum!
o no what will Kevin Durant Damian Lillard Devin Booker Jayson Tatum and Zach Lavine do without offensive help
"Stars coming out of games is part of the freaking sport and they need to stop selling out to casuals to the detriment of the game. If you watch the Celtics to see Jayson Tatum instead of the Celtics, Im not interested in how much you enjoy the game"
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"Yup. I love book and he still is growing into his prime but he hasn’t reached that top 10-5 range of nba players. Those are the guys who cannot really be stopped. I think he’s more in that donavan Mitchell / jayson Tatum / Paul George range. Perennial all star, top 15ish.  Though if he can develop a really good consistent pull up three (say 38-40%) he would reach another level of offensive talent."

Are we sure that's not just Jayson Tatum?
"yeah and jayson tatum is a much better NBA player  just magic johnson was BFFs with lavar ball  I dont think this is the flex you think it is ""the lakers got suckered in by pre-draft hype and missed out on a much better player"""
"Let’s give some context.   They drafted Kuzma late, solid pick  They drafted BI with the second pick one before Jaylen Brown, mediocre pick and he wasn’t productive until the Lakers traded him to a team with a real development staff  They drafted Lonzo with the second pick, one ahead of Jayson Tatum, bad pick  Thomas Bryant, similar to Ingram was good when he went to a team with a real development staff, fine pick  Randle, was a bust until last year where he continued to fizzle out in the playoffs. Drafted ahead of LaVine. okay pick, before last year would’ve been considered a terrible pick  Moe Wagner, dude fucking sucks, why are you  including him  THT, you guys hype this kid up wayyyy too much, he’s a good pick, definitely not as good as Lakers fans say he was  Zubac, I mean he’s fine, I guess."
"Deuce as in 2,he’s Jayson Tatum the second"
"Thybulle defense is special, and the special type that doesn’t come across too often. He’s not even the Tony Allen or Lu Dort type of guy that can clamp you up with physicality or laterally sliding his feet. Thybulle is a savant with length, instinct and timing, he can fit perfectly in about any defensive scheme, can clamp a lot of dribble penetration from fast guards like Kemba and Lavine with his length and timing.. struggles a little bit rn bc he’s not strong against bigger wings like Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum but that can easily be improved, another thing is his defense turns into live turnovers: steals, blocks that lead to transition offense is so valuable.."
"Jayson Tatum has such a boring personality, honestly a lot of these young guys do. Nobody is really beefing or talking trash in the same way that people did in the 2000s, probably because they are a lot more smart with their image and often are friends with these guys or know them from AAU. Trae Young has been the biggest young star trash talker, but honestly even then its nowhere near the level of guys like Kobe, early Lebron, Shaq, Kevin Garnett. A lot of these young stars too are wealthy upper middle class - rich people who didn't have to struggle in the same way so they don't have the same dog in them that a guy like KD has."
Jayson Tatum plays and USA loses both games. Tatum doesn't play and USA wins by a blowout. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
"For future reference, it’s a lot more impactful if you left out the “I don’t care anymore, I have a job to go to” portion of your comment. Even if it’s true, it makes you look like a punk that couldn’t handle the heat.,  *Against who? I was very straightforward. I thought the joke was funny and felt true. I also think it’s crazy that Jayson Tatum is now 23. Your “analysis” of my comment was wrong and overly complicated. I’m not sure where the disconnect is *  See doesn’t that look so much better."
"Jayson Tatum sucks bandicoot balls. He thinks because he can he a easy turnaround jumper 40% of times he's Kobe. Yea you better not think you are one of the best young players in the league Jayson, because you aren't. 8th seed in the East and only gets hyped up because he's lightskin. Just Sickening."
Jayson Tatum was clearly holding team USA back
Jayson Tatum out! What the heck?

Jayson Tatum is the issue you’re right
"Celtics management have gone to the eastern conference finals 3 times in the last 5 years, drafted Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and managed to build a roster one year of Kyrie, pre-injury Hayward, Brown, Tatum, and Horford with Smart, Rozier, Mook, etc. off the bench.   It’s new management anyway. I don’t think people would agree with you on that. The Celtics had been the most consistently good team in the NBA over the 2010’s."
"We can absolutely bash a team with Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, and Kevin Durant on it for losing lol."
"I suppose it would be something like Jayson Tatum ≤  Player x  ≤ Bradley Beal   You know, all those dudes"

Jayson Tatum tenderly caressed his defender’s knee.   “Get on your knees” he said.   The defender did as he was told “I’ve…” he paused with nervous excitement. “I’ve  never done anything like this before.”  Tatum threw up an airball but he didn’t care. He was taking his prize
"&gt;Throughout the games, multiple players, from Jayson Tatum to Bradley Beal  The hell does this even mean? Is there a range between Tatum and Beal? Who would be considered inside that range?"
"I see Cade as more of a Jayson Tatum type myself over a Luka type.  If he’s coming to Detroit I don’t think he’ll be our primary playmaker, he’s more likely gonna be asked to score."

"This deal would be arguably be more than what we got in that deal from the Nets, assuming we are considering Dame equal to Pierce, KG, and Jason Terry, which I think is fair. It was 4 picks (went on to be James Young, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Colin Sexton) along with Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, MarShon Brooks (waived), and Keith Bogans (refused to come to Boston) Wiseman and Wiggins are significantly better than Humphries and Wallace."

It’s like Jayson Tatum and that’s the list. Tatum’s only an elite shooter with muscle because his natural form doesn’t push the ball but kinda throws the ball. The motion isn’t really changed by how strong one becomes.   Other muscular players with nice jumpers I can think of are like Dame but he’s lean muscular rather than big muscular so his form isn’t interfered with.

"That's kind of the expectation nowadays for #1 scoring options. Would you ever expect KD to score less than 30 if he's forced to put the team on his back. Lebron? Steph? Dame? Hell, even Jayson Tatum and others.  It's just the reality of being the number one option on a contending team. There are very few instances where scoring is actually equally dispersed across all starters."

Favourite: Domantas Sabonis  Least Favourite: Jayson Tatum
"Brad Stevens was a shit head coach for like 4 years now. He's fantastic at player development, but that's where  my praise for him ends. The heat were very beatable in the bubble. Bad coaching and failing to reign in Jayson Tatum towards the end of the game cost them the series.  Every single year for the last 4 years, you could have made easy correction s and came out on top, but Brad never did. Every single young player he's ever coached did show consistent improvement year after year though, so I'm glad he's still with the Celtics in some capacity."

"Not really, the only difference is that Brooklyn exists (and is much better) than Toronto. Milwaukee still is there. Miami will be back next year. That's really it.   Philly is a fake contender until proven otherwise/trade Simmons. Atlanta had a nice year where they surprisingly made the Conference Finals. That's nice. We've done that before, twice as a matter of fact.   Knicks/Wizards/Pacers/Bulls etc. don't have a best player that stacks up to the level of Jayson Tatum."
"Schroder, Richardson, and Horford will be better than Kemba, Fournier, and Thompson.   Plus a full season of healthy Jayson Tatum that's not affected by COVID and full season of Jaylen Brown who is not playing through knee tendinitis."
"Well I actually think they would beat the pistons and magic.  There is one thing that non-usa teams showed this year and it's actually playing like a fucking team.  How the fuck is a team with Jayson tatum, KD and lillard losing? Dude that's easily 3 of the top ten mothafuckas at the top of basketball period. Well USA good ole US of A don't know how to mesh and play together. Even Luka wasn't getting no buckets but was able to set his teammate up with 20 assists? Bro that's so crazy when his real life teammates is porzi and Hardaway Jr. Like dawg you can't think just because NBA players =good player anymore. Jared Dudley will lose to a lot of the olympic players this year. Not all the exact best players in the league and we all know that."
Jayson Tatum is one of those kids
I actually believe Jayson Tatum will be in the conversation. Just came off of 50 point game against Nets big 3. Olympic run. And now the team is fully lead by him (no Kamba).  I think the Celtics will be better than people expect and Tatum will prob get most of the credit for it. But they gotta be top 3 seed.
All this to stop a single Jayson Tatum
"[Rohrbach] Overheard in Cavs locker room after Game 7: “He got me,” LeBron said of Tatum's dunk over him. ""That f***ing Tatum boomed me."" LeBron added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add Tatum to the list of players he works out with this summer.  This is in reference to [Jayson Tatum yamming on LeBron in Game 7.](https://streamable.com/k5aby)"
Does KG really even deserve a jersey retired there? What exactly did he do in his 6 years that let’s say jayson tatum hasn’t accomplished
2011 Rondo was disgustingggg. Very much extended the big 3s values. Which led to Brooklyn sending a massive package for Pierce and KG…. Which led to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. I love sports.
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"Jayson Tatum ambled past a horde of infants as he surveyed the postnatal ward at the Las Vegas hospital.  Cascades of crying.  The off-color smell of dirty diapers.  Babies being posed for pictures.  ""I'm too young for these streets,"" Tatum said."
"The 76ers could have picked Jayson Tatum instead of Fultz, and then did nothing... they could have a lineup of ben, shamet, Covington, Tatum, and embiid. With players like Mikal bridges and thybulle coming off the bench    There's a reason the great artists seem to die young: the longer you live the more mistakes you make. Hinkie was canned before he could finish executing. All Philly had to do was not fuck it up"
So who else would be a 1b?  Jayson Tatum? AD? Kyrie?
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
Jayson Tatum being as good as he was helped a lot. Showed that superstar potential from the beginning
Jayson Tatum Main. Ja Morant dark horse.
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
"Hmm. I wonder if they considered surrounding him with Anthony Davis, Damian Lilliard, and Jayson Tatum yet."
Celtics:  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (23rd pick in 2016)  SG: Jaylen Brown (3rd pick in 2016)  SF: Jayson Tatum (3rd pick in 2017)  PF: Pascal Siakam (16th pick in 2016)  C: Mitchell Robinson (27th pick in 2018)
PG: Simmons  SG: SGA  SF: Kevin Porter Jr.  PF: Jayson Tatum   C: Mitchell Robinson  And they'd still have Embiid on the team
"&gt; but I don't see the point of talking up Danny's acumen if he wasn't really able to accrue those benefits from the pick.  Because it shows he's a good evaluator of talent?   In 5 consecutive years, he drafted Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams.   All 5 of those guys are going to be making at least 15 mill per year starting next year and are all Top 100 players in the league."
"Uhm, Jayson Tatum is one my favorite players and to this day I hated the decision of the Lakers to take Lonzo over him. But from day 1 of MJ in the league up to his 2nd retirement, Tatum can’t hold his jockstrap at both ends. Maybe Wizards MJ when he was a playing part owner of the franchise at age 40 Jayson has a chance."
Jayson Tatum *grows* up to be that kid
"Because they think we're stupid enough to watch a video on what Jayson Tatum thinks about Gelo. And sadly, they are correct."
"Ironically, his ceiling is Jayson Tatum"
Jayson Tatum grew up to be that kid
Grew up? That kid is Jayson Tatum.
That kid grew up to be Jayson Tatum
Imagine following Jayson Tatum around so you can ask him if he thinks Dennis fuckin Schroeder can land a big contract next year lmao
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."

Tell that to Jayson Tatum.
Jayson Tatum went to highschool with NHL player Matthew tkachuk
Bradley Beal used to walk Jayson Tatum home from school
"People just define basketball skill in a very arbitrary confined way. How you read the game, your decision making, how malleable your skill set is in different context all that tends to get ignored partly because its harder to gauge. Skill and ""talent"" largely just gets reduced down to making contested buckets, whether it looks cool if you move your feet on defense and other just flashy super easy to notice things. There's rarely real consideration in terms of how a skill set fits in at a 5 man team level and how it adds to a team at a 5 man level overall. How much do you actually stress an opponent with how you operate on both ends is something I often come back to when I look at why certain players volume stats dont match their impact metrics.   ""Feel for the game"" is a vague nebulous phrase but there was just something very different in terms of how like rookie Jayson Tatum approached the game and found different ways to contribute when he couldnt take contested jumpers vs how rookie Wiggins approached it"
La4ss - jayson tatum
"Are you actually brain dead? I said the duo of Tatum and Brown were the most efficient in the NBA. I'll break it down even simpler so someone of your IQ can understand it. When Jaylen and Jayson play together, at the same time, in the same line-up, they are one of the most efficient duos in the NBA. If you can't understand that then I don't know what you're doing in the NBA subreddit.  Huh even with that racism Jaylen doesn't want to leave. What does that say about New Orleans if every player wants to get out of dodge?"
https://twitter.com/abovethebreak3/status/1413735578324152323  &gt;i think Nikola Jovic is the first prospect i've seen directly emulate Jayson Tatum.  - PD Web
PG: Jason Kidd / Derrick Rose  SG: Michael Jordan / Klay Thompson  SF: Kawhi Leonard / Rick Barry  PF: Kevin Durant / Jayson Tatum  C: Bill Russell / Hakeem Olajuwon
He probably would rather play with his childhood friend Jayson Tatum
Keep up that talk while we are in the second round and y’all get swept by the nets or bucks. And please is see plenty of comparisons of Jayson Tatum being close to Luka. Still don’t get how in your mind. Two guys in jayson and jaylen who are in your opinion way better than our 2nd guy and Marcus smart who is apparently better than our 2nd guy leads to a .500 average while we were at .568 in the west vs the East.
Luka-Bradley Beal-Jaylen Brown-Jayson Tatum-Joel Embiid with RJ Barrett-Otto Porter- and Enes Kanter off the bench.
"Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum.  This sub and the NBA community has had a hard-on for Tatum for years. He was a more heralded recruit, is the subject of the infamous Fultz disaster for the 76ers, was better as a rookie when he was super young for his class, etc etc.  Since then Tatum has gotten a lot better but hasn't gotten better at nearly the same rate as Brown. Brown has been more efficient, just as good an outside shooter if not better, and in my opinion has a much higher ceiling as a defender because of his lateral quickness and strength."
"Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown"
"Not a top 15 player. Not even a Simmons hater but I can confidently say he's not top 15.   Lebron, Steph, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, Harden, Doncic, Jokic, Dame, AD, Embiid, Butler, Jayson Tatum, PG, and Kyrie are all undeniably better than him, and there's a ton more that I haven't mentioned."
"Jimmy Butler also had better offensive options around him last year to finish his passes. ""Only 6 points per game"" is literally bigger than the difference between Steph and Jayson Tatum, 6 points at that level is massive. Jimmy's scoring is probably his biggest liability and is the biggest issue with him as a first option"
Devin Booker&gt;Jayson Tatum
"Weird how you left off the one stat that is directly related to the score, Jayson Tatum averaged more ppg then jimmy Butler has ever averaged in his 4th year. It is absolutely not unreasonable to pick the person who has made the ECF in 2/4 years and while I agree jimmy is a better defender the Celtics lacked defensive identity this year but Tatum had shown he can be an excellent defender before so it's not like comparing the best defender ever to the worst. ""Doing everything better except scoring"" is kind of a big deal."
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum will lead the Celtics to a ring within the next three season.
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both good players and on stable teams. Good enough to be All-stars for a stretch, but they don't really generate headlines that casual fans would remember."
"Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum  Jaylen has gotten better every single year he’s been in the league. His defensive impact is huge, and the strides he’s made offensively since his rookie year have been absurd. It seems like it’s widely accepted that Tatum is the more valuable piece, but I think the career progression so far matched with his supreme leadership makes Jaylen one of the most valuable players in the league right now"
I have a few.  1. Jaylen Brown &gt;&gt;&gt; Jayson Tatum  2. Russell Westbrook &gt;&gt;&gt; Damian Lillard  3. I also think James Harden was the best player in the NBA from 2017-2019.
"Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, etc...  they need to make a championship run or have some exceptional games like harden or lilliard to be not forgotten."
Brandon Ingram. I think he could be just as good as jayson tatum if he was in a similar situation.

Jayson Tatum ends up in the MVP discussion
Jayson Tatum is going to win MVP
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
KD just gonna leave if the team is trash so you wouldn’t even take him over Jayson Tatum anyway

Jayson Tatum is good but I think people overrate him.
lol he did not beat the big 3 “like 4 times”   Pistons were old. DRose is the most overrated player on this sub.  The east was cupcake as fuck his entire career. Oh no paul george and demand derozan! lmfao oh no Rookie Jayson Tatum!!!
"I would apply this to a player's success as well. I still say Miles Simon was better than Bibby, and Erick Barkley was one of the best Point Guards i ever saw, but they were both drafted into horrible situations and never got the playing time to prove themselves. Jayson Tatum is a perfect example of the other end with Gordon Hayward's injury."
Both Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown are super over-rated
"1. LeBron‘s championship window is closed.  2. Harden, Luka, and Trae will be completely fine with the new rule changes, but Embiid and Butler will have worse seasons than they did in 2021 as a result of them.  3. Jayson Tatum is not a fringe top-10 player. He’s not clearly ahead of any of Booker, Beal, Trae, and Mitchell. Those 5 are close to interchangeable. His defensive edge is not great enough to clear him from the other 4, who are significantly better playmakers.  4. The Blazers organization has failed to surround Damian Lillard with sufficient talent, but he should also be held accountable for their postseason woes. He is one of the worst defenders in the NBA, and his playmaking is a significant notch below that of other elite point guards (Steph, Luka, Harden, Trae, CP3). He can be an excellent second option, but can’t be the centerpiece of a championship team.  5. Julius Randle’s 2021 season was an anomaly, and it will have been his peak.  6. Michael Porter Jr. is not a max-extension worthy player yet. He is a lights-out shooter, but his IQ lapses and inability to become an elite defender (injury limitations) will be a problem for him and the Nuggets in the future.  7. Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson are the two most overrated players in NBA history.  8. Kevin Garnett at his peak was better than Tim Duncan at his peak.  9. Stephen Curry is the best offensive player ever.  10. The Suns will win the 2022 NBA Championship."
"If the rockets had eliminated the warriors the cavs weren’t a issue at all lol. Lebron can’t do everything. Hed get his numbers but our team won 65 games for a reason, Victor oladipo and jayson tatum each took bron to 7 games and you’re implying harden and Chris Paul that already beat the GOAT team wouldn’t take them down?"
"It’s not like they made bad picks but I wouldn’t say they “hit” on every single one   Like at the time Ingram Lonzo Russell were all the right picks but all underwhelmed at times on the Lakers, and guys behind them (Jaylen brown, jayson tatum, kristaps Porzingis ) have done better"
"I think what Tatum needs to improve on more than anything right now, which is inconveniently Boston’s biggest weakness, is off-ball playmaking ability. Boston desperately needs an all star level point guard to run point, with Jayson and Jaylen as your two outlets, it instantly makes the team a contender. Jayson Tatum and the Celtics need a competent point guard to develop Tatum’s off-ball playmaking and improve ball movement within the team.   Sure it’ll help If Tatum develops into a competent on-ball playermaker, but the archetype of point forward like Lebron and Luka came into the league with phenomenal court vision already, at best Tatum can be a secondary playmaker on a championship team, but if he can plays off-ball more like catch &amp; shoot and cutting the sky is the limit for him"
"Jayson Tatum, DBook, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine have already peaked. I can’t see any more upward trajectory due to the fact that all of their games offensively are predictable and sometimes one-dimensional"
"&gt;Jayson Tatum is knocking on the door of superstardom. He may be ""top fiye"" in our hearts, but realistically, he's sitting somewhere around the 15th best player in the league. That's an absolute home run of a draft pick, but short of the 04 Pistons, I can't think of a team that won where their best player wasn't a clear cut top 10 player. I will humbly submit that Jayson Tatum does not need to get any better at scoring the basketball to make that jump into the top 10, but instead must develop as a passer and playmaker to truly unlock his superstar potential.      Bill Simmons (I know, bear with me here people!) opens up his Book of Basketball with a conversation with Isiah Thomas (the asshole not our beloved King in the Fourth). Their discussion centers around ""The Secret"" of basketball. Isiah ultimately concludes that ""the Secret of basketball is that it's not about basketball."" Simmons elaborates:      Nobody writes about The Secret because of a general lack of sophistication about basketball; even the latest ‘revolution’ of basketball statistics centers more around evaluating players against one another over capturing their effect on a team. Numbers help, but only to a certain degree. You still have to watch the games. The fans don’t get it. Actually, it goes deeper than that—I’m not sure who gets it. We measure players by numbers, only the playoffs roll around and teams that play together, kill themselves defensively, sacrifice personal success and ignore statistics invariably win the title.      The ""sacrifice personal success"" makes me think of Giannis relentlessly attacking the rim and going to the line despite embarrassing himself there on occasion. It didn't matter, he knew his team needed him to be aggressive to be successful, ego be damned (looking at you Ben Simmons).      In order for the Celtics and Tatum to t  Now this, is beautiful."
i myself am insanely jealous of Jayson Tatum.
"Jayson Tatum is overrated, BUT is still a good player. I think he, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown are all about the same."
"I watched Booker in the last two seasons take his game to another level as a playmaker which open up his elite dominance offensively. Booker has the killer instinct, he has leadership skills, teammates will ride or die for him, he can get others to outperform their abilities. He has superstar written all over him. His defensive metrics hurt him but as we saw in the playoffs, he can defend and communicate well enough.   When I watch Tatum. I've always been mindblown by his unbelievable skills and talent level. His footwork and now that he is 6'10, its even more telling than ever. Personality wise. I've never been impressed. Not a leader that his team will fight for. More of a true worker. You just don't get the vibe that his teammates will do whatever for him. Doesn't have an edge. Just kinda does what's needed. Hey Jayson, we need 50 tonight, I got cha. Like alphas just know it. Jayson feels like he has to be told how great he is. I don't like his personality for a superstar. For a secondary star, he's perfect but the main guy, that mfer has to be a leader. One of the reasons Milwaukee brought in Thannis was that he can get the most out of Giannis personality wise. I don't know who that is for Tatum but find him and fast and maybe that's still not enough.   I know fans see Basketball like its 2k but Tatum can literally fix everything guys here are requesting and it's still not enough."
Tatum is so close…all he needs now is to leave that terrible franchise and come play for a real championship franchise. No more of this 1 in 30 years type team. Come play where the champs plays jayson
Bucks are so heavily overrated in this exercise. Middleton is on the same tier as kyrie and jayson Tatum and jrue is on the same tier as Trae young and booker and Zion.   Seth is a miluakee guy but still this is kinda crazy. I get winning a ring does a lot but still you can’t ignore that the 3 best teams were all injured.

Nets &gt; Bucks &gt; Heat &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Celtics. It's Jayson Tatum versus the world right now.
I know he’s grown an inch each of the last three years. At his age I’d believe it. I think he could end up at around 6”10 like Jayson Tatum did
Jayson Tatum &gt; Markelle Fultz
"This kid is going to land on his feet.   He had a rough season, and his playoff performance was likely hampered by the COVID-19 recovery (I think a lot of people are forgetting about that).  He's a great talent. I think a deal with Boston will give him the opportunity to show what he still has, and he'll likely get his pay day afterward.   I remember Jayson Tatum had some bad games in the weeks following his COVID recovery, and he was using an inhaler. He had a couple single digit games, and some low/mid teen games. Granted, he still dropped some solid number, but could you imagine the criticism he'd get if he dropped if, over the course of a four-game sweep on the losing end, he dropped 13, 9, 31, and 14 in each game? People would have been trashing him.   But that was one of his stretches.   Hell... he even had a 9 point game in the first round (before his 50 and 40 point games).   And he had three 20-point games in the playoffs.  People just focus on that zero-point game an ignore context.   I think a lot of this is casual fans seeing ""Wow, what idiot turns down 84 million."" They see it as greedy.  But the dude was betting on himself. You want a player with that kind of confidence. He knew his ability, and had the Lakers been healthy this year, he may be signing a 120 million deal and getting a ring instead.  But AD went down, and he was recovering from COVID.   It was just really shitty timing."
I'll believe it when I see it with the Bulls. I actually liked your squad much more before you made the DeRozan move.   The Celtics are never going to be an 8 seed with a healthy Jayson Tatum. It seems like everybody forgets that he had COVID and came back far too quickly.

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

"Ultimately, as a result of trading Pierce, Garnett, Jason Terry, and DJ White, the Celtics have gotten:  * Marcus Smart 6th overall in the 2014 draft (this was the Celtics' own pick, but it is unlikely they would've been drafting 6th if they kept their core)  * Jaylen Brown (pick from Nets)  * Jayson Tatum (pick from Nets, traded to 76ers for 3rd overall pick and 2019 15th overall pick)  *  2018 8th overall pick Colin Sexton (traded to Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving)  * Romeo Langford  The ***only*** thing I fault Ainge for and felt was completely boneheaded in the moment was giving an aging undersized guard a 4 year $141M contract.  Other than that, I can't really think of anything he did wrong.  Hayward was an awful contract but at the time of the signing it seemed great.  And I don't put much stock into ""rumors"" that don't pan out, because none of us are in these front offices, and I would bet that over 80% of NBA rumors are complete BS made up either by reporters or GMs just as a smokescreen."
"Russell Westbrook, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Shaq"
Anyone else getting Jayson Tatum vibes from Booker? His confidence is off the charts.
I mean at this point Jayson Tatum is just infinitely better than giannis post season and I really don't know if I should or shouldn't put a /s after that statement lol
Huge respect to Jayson Tatum. He showed tremendous fight along with the rest of the Hospital Celtics.  I hate Marcus Smart with a passion but that dude would NOT have let his teammates fold like the Bucks just did.  Bucks need to find their mental fortitude if they want to get back into this. Giannis looking shook at the FT line was some sad shit to watch.
Jayson Tatum&gt;Bucks entire team
Celtics need a jayson Tatum 50 point game to win a close game lmfao
"I have huge respect for Jayson Tatum after these first two games. Giannis is just way easier to gameplan for defensively.  The Bucks aren't this bad, but if Giannis is going to keep playing like this they're in a lot of trouble.  See y'all in Milwaukee."
Just how good is Jayson Tatum? Just how bad were the Miami Heat?
Now all of you apologize to Jayson Tatum and the Boston bench.
Jayson Tatum
Couldn't sag 5 feet off Jayson Tatum on the perimeter. It makes a huge difference. Way easier to gameplan defensively for Giannis.
honestly is mind boggling to me that jayson tatum put up a better fight w less than the bucks. crazy world
He’s been top 15 the fuck?  He’s closer to top 10 than 15th which is Jayson Tatum for me
Jayson Tatum &gt; Giannis
it’s not a hot take that Jayson Tatum is better than Giannis right?
"Welp, Clippers fan now.  How Mike fucking Budenholzer let Griffin play like this, when even Brad Stevens, make him look real bad with Jayson Tatum and TRISTAN THOMPSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
"Yeah they're dominating this hard not because they're a superteam but the Bucks are ass. Jayson Tatum with scraps made it more competitive than the Bucks' ""big 3"" are making it look right now"
"If MLE gets swept, is Jayson Tatum better than the bucks? Cause we couldn't do anything to stop him"
Jayson tatum literally did better on a much worse team (no kemba and brown)
"Jayson Tatum went Super Saiyan, nuff said. Tatum is also WAY more aggressive than Giannis, for some reason. I'm shocked that Giannis isn't bullying his way to the rim on every possession."
Is Jayson Tatum better than the Bucks' small 3?
"We aren’t comparing to wings. Luka is not listed as a wing. As a guard Luka naturally has more opportunities for assists because he plays as the primary playmaker. That’s why comparing against their own positions is important. Luka is being compared to primary playmaking guards and Tatum is getting compared to power forwards. If Tatum had Luka’s playmaking he still shouldn’t be compared to a guard playmaking wise.   Technically Larry Bird has less assists per game than Luka but Larry is clearly a better playmaker than Luka and always will be. Larry though was not a guard, so while his assists numbers compared to a guard aren’t that elite, his assists compared to every single wing in history show how elite of a playmaker he was. That’s why it’s important to compare against one’s own position.  Scoring wise I’m not even letting you argue that Luka is a better scorer. Luka had much more help in his playoff series while Jayson was missing 3 starters and missed half a game with an injury. Jayson was doubled literally every single possession yet still managed to take a game off of the most talented team in history while only averaging one less point than Luka. The difference between the two scoring wise is monumental. We can see that with Tatum having 4 games this past 20 games where he demolished Luka’s career high including one where Tatum scored 14 points more, getting 60 in the 3rd largest comeback in league history."
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
This meme will one day be older than Jayson Tatum himself
Jayson Tatum.
"Honestly don't remember his tenure but was he really that shit? I only remember the Kristaps pick and him trying to trade Kristaps to Boston for the pick that became Jayson Tatum (I think it was actually the NO.1 pick but I'm not sure about that), another lottery pick, and an unamed player. That actually would've been a good haul for KP. Was he just shit everywhere else?"
Jayson Tatum was out.
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
"Until you have fans making fun of Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown for admitting they have depression, or purposefully misrepresenting every quote they say as some type of ""cocky""/disrespectful attitude, then no, your franchise isn't hated more than the Clippers."
J tatum looks a lot like jayson tatum
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
This just in: Jayson Tatum publicly calls for hiring of Jason Kidd
"you can mention like 20 players in the league and then you go ""hang the fuck on, Zach LaVine and Jayson Tatum can drop 50 on any given night and they're not in there?"""
&gt;Why is James Harden getting outsold by Jayson Tatum?  Little kids love Tatum.  He's the new Kyrie in that regard.
"The Kuzma-Schroder slander on here is laughable. Kuzma is legitimately two shortened years removed from averaging 18PPG. He’s 25 years old and was thrust into an undefined role for a championship contender. Is he going to be Jayson Tatum? Obviously not. But for a DIFFERENT team he’s still a versatile scorer that fits in today’s small ball stretch style. He’s making $13mil/YR and people are calling his contract an albatross? You can’t even get a bag of chips in today’s NBA for that much let alone a player in his physical prime that has the ability to score from many different areas on the court. For God’s sakes David Bertans is getting $15mil/AAV and he’s a statue that does nothing but pull egregious threes.  Schroder was up and down but his splits from month to month were still fairly decent. He’s clearly a strong player that probably needs a clear defined bench microwave role but insists on being a starter. Again, not a bad player for $20mil/yr which is what people are assuming he gets.  Did we all forget that the Lakers were at one point 22-6 to start the season before the injuries piled up? They were an absolute powerhouse defensively and their offense was dynamic and consistent. Clearly they were the best team in the NBA besides maybe the Utah Jazz.  The Lakers just need to run it back minus Drummond and Trez. Trez should opt out and seek a multi-year deal from a bad team with cap space and Drummond isn’t about to latch on for a veteran’s minimum at 27 years old to role play a garbage disposal.  Let those two go. Resign everyone else. Have Gasol playing no more than 8MPG. Sign Dwight Howard and/or Nerlen’s Noel."
Good thing Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum got those 2 spots then. Looks like the voters were right.
"That’s the truth. Moreover, most nephews think Giannis can just replicate Jayson Tatum this series but ignore that Giannis is a two-level scorer compared to Tatum being an all-around scoring juggernaut. But we’ll take the downvotes for the next couple days."
Jayson Tatum was 20 when his kid was born as well and has appeared to be an upstanding father.
"Y’all ever heard Jayson Tatum, like the song? That shit slap"

Did it really need a s? I just called jayson tatum a scrub for ONLY getting 40 ...
Crazy cause I’m a KD stan but Jayson Tatum is my favorite young player. I became a fan of Tatum before KD said this but it’s funny to see KD give him such super high praise
"This sounds like the perfect straw man argument for Ryen Russillo's next NBA monologue lol  ""*I've even seem some people blaming Jayson Tatum for not playing well enough early in the series against the Nets and I'm like...wait, what?""*"

Jayson Tatum.
"Paul George should be the better player being 31. That’s about the end of your prime in the NBA (27-32). With that being said, I’d rather have Jayson Tatum right now."

"Blazers have to give up Nassir Little too and probably add picks, people said Kuzma was better than Jayson Tatum so he's probably gonna be elite any day now"
I just want to tell you I will never forgive Jayson Tatum for what he did in the season opener this season.
I think you can reasonably hate a player as a rival. Like I hate Jayson Tatum because he is on the celtics and helps them win games. But if it goes farther than that’s unhealthy.
"Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell.  Anthony Bennett (out of the league), Victor Oladipo (derailed by injuries), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2x MVP and a DPOY), Rudy Gobert (DPOY).  Stephen Curry (still playing at an elite level) and Blake Griffin (now a role player/situational starter). And Curry's older as well."
But he’s also better than Jayson Tatum according to Lakers fans
dame needs to partner with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. that would be lethal
"that's amazing. the suns are a great team and monty is an amazing coach. shoutout book too, him and Jayson Tatum are the two closest to Kobe rn."
Guys.............................................Im beginning to think Kuzma isnt better than  Jayson Tatum.
Better than Jayson Tatum
Just you’re daily reminder that Kuzma was thought to be at one point better than Jayson Tatum
"The league's young talent is fucking incredible. Luka has more 38+ point playoff games than games with fewer than 38, Donovan Mitchell has multiple 50 point playoff games, Jayson Tatum has had a 50 point playoff game, Jamal Murray has had a 50 point playoff game and now Booker is gonna drop 50 in a series clincher too."
Jayson Tatum . Dude just dropped 50 points against the Allstar Nets a few games ago .

"Also these executive surveys/interviews are always disappointing because you get an idea for how out of touch some of them are.  &gt;“I think they’ll trade Smart this summer if I had to guess,” an NBA executive told HoopsHype. “Retool around Tatum and Brown if they can get real value for Smart, but a lot up in the air there.”   Looking at the leading players assisting the Jays:    Jayson| Jaylen ---|--- Marcus |Marcus  Jaylen|	Jayson Kemba|	Kemba Rob |	Payton Grant |	Rob     Looking at their Offensive Rating with Marcus On/OFF:  Player| Marcus OFF| Marcus ON ---|---|---- Jayson | 112.2| 116.8	 Jaylen| 112.3	| 112.2   Looking at their worst scoring nights:   * With Marcus: Jaylen and/or Jayson had ≤5FGM in 4/48 games when Marcus played.   * Without Marcus: Jaylen and/or Jayson had ≤5FGM in 10/24 games when Marcus didn't play.  The Jays are 5 times more likely to have a terrible scoring night when Marcus sits.   ***  He's a pass-first PG who leads the charge in getting the Jays involved and their worst scoring nights are often when Smart sits.   He's a big switchable and highly regarded defender which capitalises on the Jay's switchable defensive skills.   He's able to impact the game from a very limited role which gives the Jays more freedom to take over.     If we were to build around the Jays we'd trade **for** Marcus Smart."
They really put lamelo over jayson tatum. Thats a garbage take
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
&gt; But the best they were able to do was get to the Eastern Conference Finals in a really shitty conference twice. Ainge repeatedly refused to trade young assets for proven stars in order to get over the hump and compete for a championship. This is what the Lakers did and they won a championship. This is what the Nets did and they're most likely going to win a championship.  You do realize Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum haven't left the Celtics right
"Lebron didn't leave off playing bad, he left off 39 8 8 against the Magic and 27 9 7 against the Celtics. His 2nd best player was a 37 year old Shaq, Kyrie's 2nd best player was eternal 19 year old Jayson Tatum"
he just wants to call Jayson Tatum soft again
"Wow ... this sure seems like Karma fallout from Kyrie's time in Boston.  That said, building with Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum as the current foundation isn't a bad place to try to re-launch their title hopes."
"Tatum and Brown are building pieces, would it be fair to criticize Pelicans because Zion and Ingram are plenty to build around? He fucked up crucially once in the past few years and that was keeping Rozier and Mook on contract years and telling them to take a back seat for an injured underperforming star after they got pretty far without him. Dude drafted Tatum and Jaylen when people were criticizing him for not drafting Dunn, Buddy, Dragan, Fultz, Jackson or Lonzo. Injuries basically killed whatever he's built in recent years so now the Celtics are punting for Jaylen and Jayson prime timeline"
KD without multiple all stars is glorified Jayson Tatum
So... Jayson Tatum at Duke 2.0?
And 1x fleecing Philly for Jayson Tatum
And all those draft picks which netted them Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
"I like how people still talk about the pick haul as if it didn’t turn into jayson tatum and jaylen brown, plus some players who have the potential to develop further and smart rob and pritchard with our own picks. You can criticize him for not maximizing on some of the whiffs (yabu...) but to act like he failed because he only got an all nba player, an all star, an all defense player, a guy who just blocked 9 shots a week ago and more guys with promise is nuts. If he traded tatum or brown for one season rentals of AD, PG, kawhi or butler we’d be in a much worse position than we are now"
"Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker, Rajon Rondo, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum?????"
"I assure you, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are already fully developed, strong, handsome players :*)"
Jayson tatum
"He did a good job. Made some mistakes, got unlucky, and probably could've shot for the fences more in the 2020 season, but I've generally thought that, aside from not blowing up half of the 2019 team, his decision making aged well. He gets criticized a lot for not going for that list of stars, but in the end most of those players wouldn't have been championship-level difference makers for us and would likely have left, and in the end he gets to come away with both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who each have at least an argument for being the best players in their drafts. And aside from all of that, I think people would look at him and Brad Stevens very differently had Gordon Hayward never broken his leg."
"Yeah, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are both huge wastes of assets"
The beauty of that is it was both he traded down and still got to draft Tatum. That’s an All-NBA GM move right there.   As a Boston fan not from Boston I find a lot of our fans are... well spoiled I don’t follow any other Boston teams and the run the Patriots &amp; Bruins and others have been on must play a part in the local fans sense of constant having to win titles.  I’ve been more than content with regular deep runs into the playoffs and believe so long as we hold onto the two J’s our time will come because Jayson will be a top 5 player in this league we just have to be patient and fill in the cracks as we go.
"Hey, put some respect on Robinson's name. He put the clamps on Jayson Tatum."
He got us Jayson Tatum. I’m more than happy with how we rebuilt us from the big 3 era.
"As an honest Celtics fan, I think the most ruthless thing to do would be trading Jayson Tatum to the Bulls for Felicio, Satoransky, and Al-Farouq Aminu"
What about drafting Jayson Tatum? Guess it depends on how you're classifying a move. Like a trade? Or any type of roster decision?
Jayson Tatum
"They literally did though? Besides the 2014 draft pick in which they drafted a bust (James Young), the Celtics got the Nets’ 2016, 2017 and 2018 draft pick. Guess what did they use with each of the pick? Picked Jaylen Brown with the 2016 pick, Jayson Tatum with the 2017 pick and used the 2018 draft pick to trade for Kyrie."
Yeah how dare he _checks notes_ not trade the picks that became Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
Jayson Tatum would be amazing as a no2. He sometimes.drops stinkers (like games 1 and 2) and having someone to lift the load off him would be super helpful for when his shots aren't falling.
"I mean he basically traded Markell fultz for jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.   Picked robin Williams with a late first round pick  Picked Payton Pritchard with a late first round pick   Assembled great teams of multiple all stars that have been ravaged by injuries.   Made big free agent signings of kemba walker, al Hortford , Gordon Hayward.   Traded for Kyrie with a hurt IT4 and a pick that ended up being Colin sexton.   Not all of these worked out but they were definitely the right move at the time"
Their biggest issue is that their number 2 option is a negative player on the court. Jaylen Brown is among the worst defenders in the league right now and is incapable of doing anything on offense other than scoring on transition/wide-open shots and turning the ball over.  I fear Jayson Tatum is almost guaranteed to leave Boston because 1. Brown is terrible as a #2 option and 2. Celtics fans keep comparing Brown to him.
Crazy the sixers could of had jayson Tatum and mikal
His name is Jayson Tatum Jr.  HER NAME WAS ROBERTA PAULSEN
no thats his nickname his real name is Jayson Tatum Jr.
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.

jayson tatum isoing is always nice to watch. obligatory demonstration by [marcus smart](https://youtu.be/GLmNumujCyc)
Jayson Tatum be goin crazy
"he won back to back when he shouldn't have. harden had a more dominant, valuable, and impressive season when he averaged over 30 points for 40 games.   i didn't say zion or luka or tatum is better than giannis, i said they're more skilled. he has athleticism which beats theirs for sure.   and i'm not being a homer - you asked me who i would build around but you didn't give me any specifics so i answered for multiple situations, and if i was building a dynasty around a player, i would take just turned 23 year old jayson tatum who continues to get better every year and has more pure basketball skill than 26 and a half year old giannis who still struggles with a shot and will not have his speed and jumping ability forever."
Isn’t Jayson Tatum playing like 1.8 fewer minutes? Are you worried?
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He’s better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn’t easily."
"The thing is that people have such wildly different reactions to it. On the Celtics, Marcus Smart was asymptomatic and said he found it easy getting back into game shape when he came back. Jayson Tatum got it and still has to use an inhaler.   I can’t find anything about how MPJ was affected but I know Seth was one of the ones really badly affected. That doesn’t mean MPJ isn’t just not talking about it, but if he didn’t have as severe symptoms, it probably wouldn’t impact their games to the same extent."
"Celtics go to the ECF, no bias  Jayson Tatum averages 40, no bias   Jabari Parker has a 37 point game, no bias  Luke Kornet moves up to number 1 in all time regular season + playoff three for a 7 footer, no bias  Sixers get swept, no bias"
Giannis LeBron Kawhi Paul George Zion Williamson. Pick Jimmy Butler or Jayson Tatum for the final spot   Those should be the forwards. Sorry Julius Randle and whomever else misses the cut.
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
They deleted the Jayson Tatum Subway post. There’s something they don’t want us to know.
I’m getting the sense Jayson Tatum doesn’t consume Subway sandwiches at the rate he claims to consume them.
"Would you take Brandon Ingram over any of the following: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, or De'Aaron Fox? Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.  I just wonder if the Pels are risking mediocrity by trying to make Zion and Ingram work just because they maxed him already."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were middle schoolers as well one day.
No Jayson Tatum jr. So deuce because he’s the second
Are we sure that's not Jayson Tatum's friends filming Jayson Tatum?
"That's just a nickname. He's Jayson Tatum Jr. so they call him Deuce. Would be funny if Jayson's son Jayson also named his son Jayson then he could be ""Tre"" since there's now 3 of them. Lol."
"you also have to remember this: just because you have vaccine doesn't mean you are immune to the virus, that means your chances of having the disease to the point you have to go to hospital drop significantly.  Or use this comparison: just because you have body armor, that doesn't mean you won't get hurt if someone shot you, it just hurt...""less"".  Beside, with so many ppl still not vaccinated, do you really want to run the risk of getting COVID even with the vaccine?  Just ask Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert how they feel now, long-haul COVID is real, don't risk it."
"I mean Shai was ahead up until he got hurt, and it was even more significant before the Celtics went on this run. I don’t see how we can knock Shai for being hurt and shut down by a tanking team who’s in no hurry to bring him back (because he’s too good).  Jaylen and Jayson are both historically not highly efficient players. You’re making my point for me when you argue Jaylen and Jayson play with other primary playmakers, because they NEED that to succeed, we saw the Celtics slump badly until Kamba stepped up a bit as a playmaker.  Shai put up better numbers with a G-League team around him, while Tatum/Brown have one of the best coaches in the league and have plenty of talent around them.  So yeah, you can make the sample size argument, but you’d have to actually watch Shai to see that he’s legitimately elevated this year. Like I said though, I understand taking Tatum with how he’s looked the past month or so, but Brown is too far."

This game had:  -Shit officiating (both ways)  -Jayson Tatum getting the worse triple double I have ever seen  -Tremont Waters as one of the best Celtics players on the floor  -Grant Williams interviewing for a Chicago Bulls job
If I cherry pick games pretty much all of the max guys have stretches of 30 ppg. None of them need to cherry-pick to get to 22 a game.  If you look at his averages he’s below pretty much all of them.  MPJ is a 22 year old. He’s 6 months younger than tatum. 6 months ago jayson tatum was putting up 25-10-4  in the playoffs. MPJ is not at that level and will never be.   Mo bamba also hasn’t played minutes. Nobody thinks that he’s still some super high potential prospect. This is because he’s had 3 years of nba training.   Guys who play their “rookie year” as 21 and 22 year olds don’t have the growth curves of guys who start at 19. I don’t understand which part of this is so hard to understand.  He’s a siakam level player on offense without siakam level defense and he’s probably getting paid around a siakam level contract (maybe a bit less).
The old steph vs Jayson Tatum 😤
"&gt;If jayson tatum at his current age was playing like MPJ, nobody would be trying to give him the rookie max.   No one would be considering 22/9 on 68%ts for a max with another season yet to go on the rookie deal?"
"I can guarantee that every nba player would agree with me that having 2 years of prior nba coaching is not equivalent to being a rookie. That’s why Donovan was wearing “not a rookie” t-shirts with Ben Simmons.   MPJ is about 5 months younger than tatum. If jayson tatum at his current age was playing like MPJ, nobody would be trying to give him the rookie max."
The sub is not “full of trade Jayson Tatum and trade Jaylen Brown”. You clearly haven’t been on there.
"And he won't be earning the max next season. It would kick in for the 22/23 season.   He is already averaging 20ppg/9rpg on insane efficiency over his last 30 games, which just brought him up to the minutes played of a starting rookie (Jayson Tatum played 2450 minutes his rookie year, MPJ is only at 2300 minutes played so far).  If he only improves a little, he'll average 22/10 next season on his rookie deal, then the max kicks in. Who doesn't max a kid who puts up stats like that on his rookie contract? And if he improves a lot/ anywhere near the pace he has this season? He'll be a 25-27ppg scorer on elite efficiency while providing 10 boards a game and offering rim protection and at least solid defense. That's a fucking all nba player, with just normal improvements in his game (handle, quicker decisions, better rotations, moving feet, all things easily learned)."
"His development isn't even that slow realistically. He has barely played 100 pro games and a good chunk of those was being eased in after injury/not playing for 2 years.   In basically 70 games he has gone from bad to acceptable defense, bad to acceptable handles, and in the last 20 games is posting 21.5ppg/8.7rpg on insane shooting splits and a 67.24% true shooting.   For comparison, Jayson Tatum from games 80-100 (and at that point he had about 500 more minutes played) was posting 16/6 on 55% ts.   Mpj is putting up year 3 Tatum numbers and *hasn't even played as many minutes as Tatum did **his rookie year***. Mpj is posting, between 1600-2300 minutes played, the numbers Tatum started posting after 5000 minutes played.  That's actually really dramatically fast development, he just missed a bunch of time at the start. Since he has been given regular minutes, he is developing lightning fast and is a no brainer for a max"
Defense - Jayson Tatum   Shooting - JR Smith  Both defense and shooting - KCP or maybe Danny Green
"Jayson Tatum after Luka decides to come to the Cs to form a devastating big three with JB.   Jokes aside, it would have to be someone like AD or Bam. Great defenders who do stuff off the dribble."
Here is the full list updated on the season:  Julius Randle: 7/22  Kyrie Irving: 4/14  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5/13  Devin Booker: 3/11  Steph Curry: 1/5  LeBron James: 2/8  Bradley Beal: 1/7  Domantas Sabonis: 2/6  Jayson Tatum: 2/6  Jaylen Brown: 2/6  John Collins: 1/7  DeAaron Fox: 1/6
"Start: De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle, Bam Adebayo  Cut: The rest of em  Shooting guard is definitely the most difficult to decide. Close race between all of them."
~~Steph Curry vs Jayson Tatum~~: I SLEEP 😴😴😴  #Chris Boucher vs Lu Dort: REAL SHIT 🤩
"Ok, say McMillan says “Cam, we are going to play you every minute (about 36) that Jaylen Brown is on the floor. Your sole purpose is to guard him. If you can limit him to 20, that’s going to be great”.  Cam can limit Jaylen to 20, whilst giving you 8 of his own, on even WORSE shooting than what Jaylen is putting up. Jaylen Brown’s shooting efficiency is .593 TS% so you’re telling jokes if you think he’s an inefficient chucker.   What happens when somebody needs to double Tatum? Is Cam excluded from that play? What if Cam is switched onto Kemba in a PNR situation and Trae is switched onto Jaylen. Do you send Cam to double Jaylen and leave Kemba wide open?  Or you’re ok with living with a 4 on 5 scenario with Jayson Tatum on the floor?  Who will be sent for the help defense? Will it be Capela? Cause Capela is such a versatile, switchable defender like Siakam and Bam are.  No I forgot, D’Andre Hunter is going to slow him down.  The entire game is going to consist of 1 on 1 matchups between Tatum/Hunter and Jaylen/Reddish, and Atlanta are going to win the +/- of those matchups lmao."
"&gt;	Capela and Myles Turner are better defenders than Bam??  There isn’t much evidence that Bam is a better defender than capela and Turner. Bam can’t rim protect like those guys can, which is the most important part of center defense. Jimmy has been a better defender than Bam this season too.   &gt;	Collin Sexton is better than Jayson Tatum btw.   If you wanna believe that go ahead. You’d be hard pressed to find any good evidence for that tho."
"Capela and Myles Turner are better defenders than Bam?? Lmao now you're just saying ridiculous things and then when people point out how ridiculous they are you just respond with ""you're a Heat fan so you're biased and it doesn't matter.""  Collin Sexton is better than Jayson Tatum btw. If you disagree it doesn't matter because you're literally just a biased Celtics fan."
Jayson Tatum Lakers Game at Staples Center last year  Final minutes was a shitshow
Jayson Tatum to the ECF.  Embiid missing half the season.  Jeff Teague floaters.  Lowry taking charges; Kemba Walker taking charges.  Zion dunking from outside the restricted area.
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
"I wonder where he got his sub if its better than Jayson tatum, firehouse subs?"
"Those jimmies were definitely rustled, and at the time it was statistically comparable.  But watching their games... man you can tell Tatum had that scoring bag since he was a teenager, compared to Pascal who excels when he has the length/quickness advantage, but you can tell his offensive game is not as refined as Jayson... it's miles wide at this point lol  With ALL that being said though, when he's engaged Pascal Siakam is an elite defender. So I look forward to the rest of the team improving offensively so that Pascal can focus on defense, run the floor, hit open shots and not be pegged into that lead offensive initiator role that Jayson is more comfortable in."
My man said Tobias fucking Harris was outplaying jayson Tatum 😂
"I get what you're saying, you do have a very valid point. But are casual fans, that are just tuning in to watch Steph play, are they the the same people sticking around after the game to watch Jayson Tatum get interviewed? I'm really asking, cus my guess is no, but I have no idea.  Like, do their faces scrunch up in confusion when they see Jayson Tatum on their screen and they angrily grumble ""no Steph?"" while scratching their heads, until Curry is mentioned and they all sigh and go ""oh...Steph!"" with big smiles on their goonish faces?"
If I could make the case for the Boston Celtics.  1. 17 championships is tied for most ever. 2. Larry Bird was a fucking monster. 3. Jayson Tatum is a 23 year old superstar and Jaylen Brown is pretty damn good himself.  4. Bill Russell can’t fit all of his rings on two hands.  5. Tacko Fall

"I said the Warriors defense is weak, they have problem on guarding this man. And the fans are crazily downvoting me just because I said something bad about Warriors.  In this game, Jayson Tatum is like Celtics version of Michael Jordan, literally unguardable. I am a huge Warriors fan, but it doesn't mean I can only state the good side of the team. Celtics have 6 more offensive rebounds and 14 more field goal attempts than Warriors. Jayson Tatum has the highest FG% in this month.   If that's not defensive problem, I don't understand what else can be regarded as defensive problem."
"Yeah from my perspective getting Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Kyrie Irving because of a trade was a terrible idea"

Jayson Tatum exists.
Jayson Tatum is worse than Jaylen Brown and the most overrated player in the league
"Surprised no one's mentioned Jayson Tatum, dude's shot looks so aesthetic."
Lmao nice one  All I’m saying is those picks could be Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum or they could be Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson but right now they are nothing. You disagree?
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i´ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren´t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
There are like 3 guys in the league who can make a comment about politics and have it be anything more than niche news. You're tripping if you think Kyle Korver or Jayson Tatum commenting on politics is having any sort of substantial effect on viewership.
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are still particularly *soft*
Jayson Tatum said the same thing in an interview when he was asked who was the best defender that ever defender him
Jayson Tatum still has 20 years till he hit his prime
"u/devic3: As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 pt game was a fluke. If Tatum and Jaylen are stars, why aren’t the Celtics winn- oh shit they are- the Celtics are only winning because of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown is doing nothing. The Green Teamers will disagree but you know it’s true, Jaylen is not a good player. Remember, all this is coming from an honest fan. Me, u/devic3."
"Oh yeah, i definitely still trust jones. I dont think smith will be a wash either, haliburton is just that good that i cant believe he got passed up that much, and the fit seemed perfect for him. Serviceable backup bigs are pretty cheap, and saric seems to fill that roll nicely anyways. You cant count out the no preseason+covid impact either. Thats stuff that pretty much takes all season to recover from depending on the severity, and maybe even longer than that after catching the [jayson tatum inhaler](https://www.sbnation.com/2021/4/14/22383455/jayson-tatum-covid-celtics-inhaler) story. So yeah, its not like im down on smith, i just think haliburton is the 2nd best player from this draft class."
I first read the title as ‘Adebayo admits he’s still tall ??? To Jayson Tatum’ and I thought this was weird.. but not something surprising
The Chad Bam Adebayo vs the Chad Jayson Tatum
In no universe an I gonna accept people thinking that Jimmy Butler is on a higher tier than Jayson Tatum.   It’s just not happening.
"watch Jaylen on defense when his guy doesn't have the ball. then watch Jayson. the difference is pretty stark, with Tatum generally putting in a lot more effort."
Now that r/bostonceltics allows memes I'm a little surprised that we haven't seen some Jayson Tatum in a suit of armor memes.
You may find this amusing:  https://valleyofthesuns.com/2018/02/24/josh-jackson-has-already-surpassed-jayson-tatum/
"1st - Harden, Luka, LeBron, Giannis, Jokic  2nd - Dame, Curry, Leonard, Durant, Embiid  3rd - Mitchell, Booker, Williamson, George, Gobert   HM - CP3 (no arguments if you swap him for Book), Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum"
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum aren’t the same person. Who’s the dumb one again?
"yeah cuz jayson tatum, jaylen brown, marcus smart, terry rozier, payton pritchard, and robert williams were wasted draft picks! good point guy! got me there!"
"&gt; Meanwhile, siakam, OG, FVV haven't really gotten any better especially on offense    [That](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anunoog01.html)  [is](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/vanvlfr01.html)  [an](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/siakapa01.html)  incredibly stupid take.   &gt;we have no rim protection  ... we have the 5th best player in the league in blocks per game  &gt;we have no rebounding   Yeah, our rebounding sucks, before we got two competent centres. Now it's average.   &gt;plus having half your team have COVID doesn't do anything  Uh, Jayson Tatum still has to use puffers becuase of COVID.  Also we were without our starting 3/5s of our starting lineup for... 6? 8? games? in a 72 game season makes a huge fucking difference.  I'm sorry if you jumped on the bandwagon in the chip year and don't know how to watch basketball, but these takes are fucking moronic."

Did you read any other part of my comment or just look at the part where I brought up the Pace and that’s it? You’re comparing basketball in 2021 to basketball in 2011. It’s a lot easier to score now-days. Teams averaged under 100 PPG back then. You can’t just look at the numbers and come to a conclusion. If you just strictly look at the numbers then every top-10 player today is better then everyone from 2011.  Would you say that 2021 Jayson Tatum is better then 2011 Kobe? Because looking at the stats and nothing else Tatum is better then Kobe.
"This was funny man, don’t take the downvotes seriously   This sub still upvotes “Jayson Tatum 19!! Simmons ROY!!!” Lol"
"&gt;He leads the entire NBA in 4th quarter scoring, ahead of Zack Lavine and Jayson Tatum.  He leads the league in 4th quarter scoring because he leads the league in 4th quarter minutes and FGA.   Fox is [15th in the league](https://go.nba.com/ujf9) in 4th quarter points per 100 possessions."
Jayson Tatum and 2 first round picks but I’m not doing that as a Celtics fan
"The ECF was against rookie jayson tatum lol, lebron was still the best player in the league and pacers, toronto and celtics didnt have top 15 player at that time.   At that time, replace lebron with kd/curry/harden/kawhi and cavs still make it to the finals.   That year the east was in their worst form, giannis and embiid wasnt become top 10 player and kyrie as well as hayward got injured."
You forgot Jayson Tatum man. He's only 19 and still growing! 😂
"You made a definitive claim: that Jayson Tatum and others permanently lose ""athletic capacity"" (by which I *assume* you mean something like vVO2max) without any data to support that claim.   I contradicted you: that it was unlikely to be permanent (given what we actually know), and *even if it was permanent,* Tatum (a rich man) made the choice to play this season in exchange for money. So no, it's not necessary for us to all virtue signal about how horrible it is that he made that choice."
"Haircut Jayson Tatum, Game 6 Klay Thompson, Michael Jordan after taking it personally"
"We doubled Dame and Jayson Tatum, but that was when we had Hart and Zo, and rn we have a bunch of guys who've never played together.   It's amazing James Johnson is fitting in as fast as he has, because he's been here like a week."
Jayson Tatum has a higher potential then Luka Doncic.
"A bunch of things. He wasn't getting the respect from the ref is probably the biggest. The over-reliance on Theis/Horford/Baynes sealing for him. His shot-selection going to shit because of those. There are a lot of games in prior seasons where Jayson would drive, get smacked around and not get called for it. If you watched rookie and sophomore Tatum, his bread and butter was actually slashing and was getting called ""long boi"" with a whole bunch of go-go gadget arms references. With Theis gone and Celtics going to shit, he's been going back to it and has actually been a monster at slashing. There are also 2 instance in the past few games where he goes for a dunk and clearly gets whacked on the head with no calls."
"Jayson Tatum, 0 bias involved."
"Yea I'm also aware that his entire tenure is somehow defined by one playoff series where the other Celtics ""stars"" played equally as terrible. Jayson Tatum scored 12 ppg with a .464 TS% in 30mpg. Do people just forget the fact that Kyrie was all nba second team that year.  But I guess it was all Kyrie's fault despite multiple teammates defending him after the fact and still remaining close with him."
"Idk bout that, don’t get me wrong he’s really good but what has he shown that’s given you Jayson Tatum vibes this early?"
One MVP season away from joining the ranks of other MVP's like Jayson Tatum.
"Unless you're Jayson Tatum, I don't think 1 year olds are allowed to be on reddit"
Jaylen Brown vs. Jayson Tatum. A lot of jealousy on both sides of who is Batman and who is Robin.
Jayson tatum
Jayson Tatum
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
Jayson Tatum?
"Dude you are way too sure of yourself on this. You say this and the Celtics ended up with jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum from pick swaps. You have no idea what will be going on with bkn in 2025, 2026, 2027. This isn’t about selling the fans on something. They are rolling the dice and it’s not a bad gamble at all. Kd is 32 off a torn Achilles, harden is 32, and ky has talked retiring early. It’s the start of 2021 right now and you are going around everywhere saying they took a bad deal when they have bkn’s firsts 6 years down the line from now."
"Anecdotally, the only 4 NBA players my girlfriend knows are LeBron, Jayson Tatum, ""Marcus Mart"" and Danilo Gallinari, because she thinks he's hot."
"I did, it's a bunch of nonsense. It's either incorrect or arguing against popular opinions as if they're unpopular.  &gt;He cuts the rim more the Durant and Harden  Last year, Kyrie cut 0.7 times per game, which ranks 7th on his own team. He cut 0.8 times per game in '19 and 0.7 in '18 (only 3% of his possessions are cuts). On Cleveland, he averaged 0.4 cuts per game.  Kevin Durant has averaged more cuts per game than Kyrie literally every year of their careers. Every single one. He cuts two times more frequently than Kyrie  So now, he doesn't cut to the rim more than Durant and Harden. He cuts to the rim less than Durant. You are talking nonsense.   &gt;Kyrie won a three point contest for crying out loud!  lol   &gt; Why would KD and Harden intentionally try to make sure Kyrie, a guy who’s 28 and can drop an efficient 50 on any night, plays 3rd fiddle scorer every night.  Kyrie has scored 50 points or more literally 4 times in his entire career. But he can score that every night? What are you on about my man.  For reference, Harden has done it 23 times.  &gt;There’s a reason LeBron said Kyrie would be selling himself short if he didn’t win a MVP before his career was over.  And that reason is what? Kyrie is not and never was an MVP-level performer, if that's what you're implying.   &gt;My final point is, can we please stop acting like Kyrie isn’t a good 1st option for a team. This guy lead the Celtics to a 41-16 record in 2018. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum were not who they are today, you think if Kyrie’s not on that team they get such high seeding? They were 14-11 without him that year but it just gets ignored because of the playoff run.  Yeah, just an ECF playoff run. Teams who are not good do not make ECF runs and play a G7 for the Finals.   &gt;They beat the Sixers who had their first playoff birth since 2012, and the Bucks who were not nearly the team they are today, and went to 7 against a Cavs team that was brutally swept in the Finals. 2019 was a troubled year because those Celtics thought because they made it that far that they were better than Kyrie.  With Kyrie they best Indiana. And that's it, that's the only series he won as the 1st option.   &gt;Was a it underachieving season, no doubt, but you don’t have to win a championship or go to the finals every year to be called a good 1st option for a team.   What you do need to do is have an actual good performance in the postseason as the 1st option. Kyrie never had that.     &gt;People want him to fail in Brooklyn and be clearly the third option when he’s 28 and has MVP caliber talent.  He doesn't have MVP caliber talent and he never did.  &gt;Hate on him all you what off the court, but as a basketball player, he’s still a top 3 PG in the league and a top 15 player and by the end of the year he could be a top 10 player if the nets have a good year and he keeps up this efficiency.  A top15 player is not MVP-caliber, obviously. And he will not be a top10 player by the end of the year."
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum both have beautiful forms
"&gt; Bold to say that when the Lakers exist  Eh, the only Lakers fans that are annoying are the Bron stans, and I can sorta see why they are the way they are. But Celtics fans man... they get Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, and these dudes go around talking about how they're the GOAT and Kobe reincarnate. tf lmao"
I question the validity of a stat that says Payton Prichard brings almost as much value as Jayson Tatum or that Jeff Teague is better than Marcus Smart or that Shake Milton is the second offensive player on Philly behind Seth Curry and also the second best defender.   There are so many glaring discrepancies in this stat that I doubt there should be much stock put in it.
For players all currently in the league I can think of   Jrue Holiday  Justise Winslow  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid
Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Jayson Tatum  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Jaylen Brown  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard  Payton Pritchard
"&gt; He was a 25 YO coming off an All NBa second team  I don't know how the fuck he got on any All-NBA team last season, never mind fucking 2nd team over Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum"
celtics rookie payton pritchard is older than jayson tatum.
Obligatory Jayson Tatum is 19 (!)
In a 2 player keeper league I kept him over Jayson Tatum so yes I did.

Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are officially a 1a and 1a duo!
"Lets be honest, the 76ers' offers just aint near as good as Nets', Id say not even close. At least 2 of the Nets picks are guaranteed to be top 4-5 picks, especially the 2026 and 2027. Remember the Celtics got Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum from these Nets picks, the Rockets can get much better returns in future.   There is a reason why ESPN rated the trade as A- for Rockets and D for Nets. Of course, it can be an A+ for the Nets if they win at least one title, but doesnt matter for the Rockets as the Nets will have to rebuild in 2025 at the latest anyway."
"when giannis came in a lot of people saw his ceiling as a superstar wing (i.e jayson tatum). he shot like 35% from three and 70ish percent from the line his rookie season and then he changed his game completely  honestly giannis with his current athleticism, finishing, speed, footwork, etc. and a developed 3 point shot and ft routine would be literally unstoppable."
"So let me get this straight- without Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker, **AND** Carsen Edwards, the Celtics still obliterated a playoff team??"
I'm not even saying they automatically win against Warriors if Chris doesn't blow his hamstring but the fact this man is bringing up the CAV's makes everything else he says absolutely ridiculous. That team was lucky bounces away from losing to 12 year old jayson tatum
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"the wizards played the nets, KD had to quarantine, wizards play sixers, several sixers are out, wizards play the celtics, jayson tatum is out with covid and the celtics are on hiatus due to covid. wizards play the bulls, bulls have covid. wizards play suns, both teams don’t have enough players due to covid. and now the wizards have the biggest breakout of all teams"
Knockoff Jayson Tatum
"The amount of hype he got going into college and the draft was like LeBron level. It’s not weird that he didn’t live up to that, few players do. I think what feeds into the Simmons hate is the fact that other guys were taken after him (both in that draft and in subsequent drafts) who have added to their games offensively and become 20+ ppg scorers while Simmons has appeared relatively stagnant to casual watchers. Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, Trae Young, Ja Morant, the list goes on. Would I rather have any of those guys? Maybe some of them. It’s probably too early to tell, but if Simmons gets traded away, the Sixers will be quantitatively worse in a lot of ways and people will see his true value."
My fantasy team needs a glass of milk. Bam. Jayson Tatum. MPJ. Nurkic. Ja
"&gt; **9 Payton Pritchard has a nose for the ball**  &gt; Where would the Celtics be without Pritchard? They are plus-45 in his 229 minutes, and minus-27 in the remaining 251 minutes. All but nearly 50 of Pritchard's minutes have come with one of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, but not both, meaning Pritchard has been crucial in Boston's offense staying afloat in minutes that are precarious without Kemba Walker.  &gt; The Celtics have gutted out a 7-3 record despite outsourcing opponents by just 18 points total. They have four wins by five or fewer points. Scrounging games you maybe shouldn't pays off in playoff seeding.  &gt; Pritchard is active on defense, with a knack for anticipating when it is safe to gamble for steals. Turn your back on him in some location Pritchard deems non-threatening, and beware a Pritchard sneak.  &gt; There are guys who read the game at such a high level -- and move fast enough -- that for them, gambling isn't really gambling. They have an edge. They count cards, basically. Manu Ginobili was a card-counter. What was reckless for most was not so for him because he operated one step ahead.  &gt; Pritchard might be a card-counter. He's averaging two steals per 36 minutes -- an elite number."
"Yeah draft picks are so overrated, thanks again for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown."
Uh oh. Next jayson Tatum. HES ONLY 19!!!!!!!!
"Listen, I will always root for the Raptors to win the game I'm watching. But there's tons of upside to losing this season as well.   First of all, this is a fake ass season. Half the league has covid, the Raptors are playing 72 road games essentially, and there's so much shit going on that I really don't think this season matters. Asterisk season. If there's a year to bottom out and just chalk it up to external circumstances, it's this one.  Second, I'm tired of always having to develop guys. I love that our team is filled with underdog guys who were drafted late and worked their way to starring roles for this franchise are great stories, but our only lottery picks on the roster are Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. For once can we just have a naturally gifted talent to build around? Can we get a Ja Morant or a Jayson Tatum. Even RJ Barrett would be a great type of player to take and develop under an organization that has proven to get the best out of its draft picks. Why not? This year's draft class is supposed to be stacked, this is the year to have a top pick. We have never signed a star free agent, we could trade for one, but we have no real trade pieces without gutting this roster for it to be even worth it. The easiest way to inject star potential talent is with a top 5 pick. We have the pieces to go, FVV/OG/Siakam, and you pair that up with a Cade/Mobley and we're off. It's just one season."
Jayson Tatum's own son is older than Jayson Tatum. Incredible how young Tatum is
Payton Pritchard is older than Jayson Tatum
"To be fair (an anomaly on /r/nba) Jayson Tatum tested positive before any Wizards did. Beal sat out the Mia game for talking to him afterwards, then the Phx game, then Wizards started testing positive. But carry on being nba reddit"
His name rhymes with Celtics star Jayson Tatum
Bootleg Jayson Tatum had 13/5/10 tho
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"Jae'Sean ""Jayson Tatum"" Tate"
That’s similar to what people said about the KG/Paul Pierce trade. I would take Jayson Tatum over Simmons and with that many picks there is a good chance they end up with at least one top three pick.
He is very good friends with one Jayson Tatum.
The trade resulted in Jaylen Brown/Jayson Tatum (and a Kyrie rental) for my Cs sooooo yeah I mean....
"The nba looks like a inter-murals tournament from college when the frats would make their own jersey, except the frats would actually have team colors and stick to them   Also the shoe color freedom drives me crazy, why the fuck is someone like jayson Tatum wearing bright yellow or purple shoes ON THE CELTICS"
"They're not extra picks, but the pick swap that the Celtics got from the Nets in the Pierce/Garnett trade turned into Jayson Tatum (and Romeo Langford), so they're definitely valuable assets still."
&gt;2024: Boston star forward Jayson Tatum has requested a trade to the Los Angeles Lakers
Bruh this story is older than Jayson Tatum. Capella only involvement in the story was likening it to a similar situation he went through in Houston.   Now we're on the game being postponed and hyping OO to the moon before his first start. Get with the times geezer.
I remember seeing this comment but with Kyrie being the 'Alfred' to Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum a couple years back when he played on the Celtics and the Jays were outplaying him.
"yeah part of the appeal of the whites for the Lakers was that they were strictly for Sundays.  Once Kobe dropped 81 in the whites they were a part of the franchise's history and I think that helped.  Ultimately alternates are fine if people like them &amp; they're done well, my grumpy old man opinion is that they should be for the ""new money"" teams that haven't been around as long and aren't as iconic/classically NBA.  Like it's really cool to me that by &amp; large Bill Russell, John Havlicek, Larry Bird, Paul Pierce &amp; Jayson Tatum all wore the same jersey with the same look, same for Wilt, Kareem, West, Magic, Shaq &amp; Kobe.     If the Timberwolves, OKC, Hawks or the Kings et al want to revamp their jerseys every year and have wild alternates that's fine for them.  I do like some of the alternates some years, but a lot of them are just awful.  Unlike most things on r/nba, this is purely subjective &amp; aesthetic, so I can appreciate that there's room for different opinions here."
"Proclaiming you know where the picks are going to land is just as irrational as the people over-rating them. No one knows what these teams will look like in half a decade, it's a gamble.  The last time Brooklyn made a similar trade, two of the picks ended up being top 3 and netted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum"
yea the last time nets traded picks it turned into jaylen brown and jayson tatum so we just gotta see
Or they could be Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum
"I think it's real close but yeah thinking about it more I might lean this way. Thing is the perimeter/wing defense if there's no PJ involved becomes pretty shaky now if this deal happens. Obviously you still do this deal but its an issue.  Ultimately though I dont think I can trust Tisse to really play 25 min a night in the playoffs this year yet and if that's the case it's just hard to justify giving up Maxey.   If the cost of getting PJ Tucker though was having to give up Maxey over Thybulle I would do it. Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard......that roster just really needs a true wing defender to win a title."
Thanks for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown btw
"Ben is the most realistic best player available for us, he's under 25, and he is on a ""friendly"" contract for a superstar over the next 4-5 years. It's the best trade available if we don't want to sink into the abyss of the west. Simmons, Wall, Wood can at least compete for a bottom playoff spot and you have building stones with Simmons and Wood. No it's not equal value to what Harden gave to us over the years but my dude it was always going to go down this way. If Ben is that much of a disaster I do believe we should be able to swing him for other assets to another team because he is certainly a desired commodity for poorer teams. Who do I want? Jayson Tatum. But it's not gonna happen."
I think he matters because they will need a bigger wing to throw on Kevin Durant Jayson Tatum Jimmy Butler and hell if they make it that far LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard. Danny green can’t do it anymore that’s the PJ duty  You want lineup flexibility. Tobias/Harden/Embiid....you don’t really need more offense around that. Want to compliment it with more wing defense if the possibility exists. I actually think the lineup I like most is Embiid/Tobias/PJ/Seth/Harden. PJ guards 4 positions doesn’t matter what you list Tobias as if you want him to guard 4s you can easily make that happen    Also Dwight looks good now but it’s no lock he’s gonna be reliable enough to hold up as a backup C after the first round. They lost a series to Toronto literally because they died without Embiid on the court PJ is a real backup 5 for 10-12 min a game you don’t have to worry about
"man im talking about how they putting players on leave due to having contact with jayson tatum while also not putting players on leave who literally played against jayson tatum, the man who supposedly had covid.   needa postpone this shit its starting to look mad stupid"
It means he was never available like I was saying.  And it means that Jayson Tatum mostly led the the team...  Like I was saying...
"First of all, there are fans that aren't too sensible in all fanbases.   \-Theis and Thompson does not make up the front court. They have Jayson Tatum and Brown at the forward positions and that therefore makes them an above average front court  \-You are completely downplaying Gobert's impact on the defensive end. Offense is more valuable than defense in this league, but I would rather have a good defensive big (especially with a team like the Celtics who have plenty of firepower) as rim protection is the most valued type of defense in the league.  It seems like you disagree with a couple people in the sub and therefore want to call them all ""idiots"""

Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward
&gt;Did most of his damage in the 1st half and cruised through the second  Ahh the Jayson Tatum special
"I mean with the rise of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, unless Gordon was truly happy with being a forth option, or even third if Kemba gets traded, the fit was never going to be great. 3 wings is great but someone is going to have to guard tall athletic 4s like AD, Christian Wood and etc. and I don’t think that’s going to work long term."
"Because we don’t have the same talent log that the Celtics do. We don’t have to fit Jayson Tatum, Kemba, and Gordon Hayward into the same offense"

\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle
"It's hard to say because I feel like what seperates stars and Superstars is consistent performance.      We've seen how good guys like Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum and others can be when they're at their best and it's comparable with top tier players but the best of the best just do it more frequently."
"For all the people saying Tatum isn't a superstar, here's some analysis of him that blows bill simmons away: [Thinking Basketball Jayson Tatum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9w01cTw4AU)"
If the season ended right now probably Paul George or Jayson Tatum. Lebron and Anthony don't really have the stats for it right now. Jokic's team is negative. Stephen's team is barely over 0.500. Joel maybe but he did miss 2 games which is 20% of the 'season'.  Paul has 25/6/5 on 50/50/95 shooting as the 3rd seed in the West.  Jayson has 27/7/4 on 47/44/89 shooting and 2nd seed in the East.

And it will be Jayson Tatum next year
Still not as young as Jayson Tatum tho
Not Jayson Tatum.

"[Murphy] Per source: Jayson Tatum tested positive for Covid today, and is now awaiting the results of a confirmation test. He is **asymptomatic.**"
"I think y’all have no idea how contact tracing and close contacts are actually determined. Jayson Tatum was just ruled out for two weeks, the NBA isn’t pulling strings so Joel Embiid is cleared to play."
Jayson Tatum is barely 19 and already 6’10”

"Again, I never spoke on that being the right way of thinking, my point was that those players are kind of incomparable. They were nowhere near the player Zion is at 20, so to compare them struggling to Zion struggling doesn’t make sense.  Maybe better comps could be the second year slumps that great rookies sometimes have. Like Jayson Tatum."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown become the worst pair of teammates in the last 20 seasons to each record 250+ points in their teams first 10 games.

"Ya they should also go for Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Mitchell Robinson and Christian Wood."
"it's almost impressive you using a big fancy word like connotation but to still have reading comprehension THIS BAD  Jayson Tatum said that some players didn't play like themselves in the bubble - obviously he's talking about dudes who played out of their minds like Murray and Mitchell   But the dude said Siakam cause the opposite is true - he didn't play like himself either, but not because he was better than normal, but because he was trash  Do you get it now"
"&gt; It just seems really stupid to me. Why do people feel a need to shit talk some of the greatest athletes in the world?   I think its because sports are a drama, and every drama needs heroes and villains. I personally have a hard time hating on guys I dont know so I make up reasons to root against em. Like I fucking love Jayson Tatum and jaylen brown but I hate Boston sports, so when I have to root against Boston, I think real hard about Brad stevens' best attempt at passionate rendition of the Friday night lights speech. That gets me nice &amp; ready to root for their demise."
Jayson Tatum isn’t even the best player on his team rn
Jayson Tatum is better then jimmy
"so they walk off the court...  only to come back and play the game...  does anybody else think this is ridiculously LOL.  Like, i get your upset about what happened, but to act like youre not going to play the game, but then you play the game...seems rather..silly?  Also, do Jaylen Brown and Jayson tatum not realize they can boycott their basketball game and the world wont miss a beat?   I'm all for correcting the injustices of our country, but these athletes seriously over believe in power/reach sometimes. It's almost a slap in the face of working class citizens, like look we can choose to work or not work, while the rest of the country is A. lucky to have a job if they do and B.  has to work through whatever shitstorm is currently winding through the country that given day of the week."
Hey so there are these guys named Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
"Lol what? By far? What about the Nuggets or your Heat for that matter? Also let's not forget they took Lonzo over Jayson Tatum, a clearly superior player."
"We had this Gordon Hayward last season. He just wasn't a fit with us anymore. When we signed him, it was expected that him and IT would carry the offense. Nobody expected Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to be this good so soon. The offense simply changed while he was hurt and his role never recovered. IMO the change was necessary for both sides."

"One of the worst defenders in the league and these bozos are saying he's at the top 😂    Embiid is the best, then there's a slew of other guys like PG, Kawhi, Conley, and Butler.     The fact that people are saying KD and Zach Lavine and Jayson Tatum speaks volumes to the state of this sub"
"If you think jayson tatum isnt better than jimmy, n beal isnt better than youre on crack."
When you study for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown but you get Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard on the test.
"Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum aren't 1, 2, or 3 in points this game lmfao imagine betting that"
"I remember the guy who was ranting about using initials for players who are unknown or who don't deserve it  I feel the same way with using first names only of players. It's okay if it's Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi or Steph, but it's getting annoying when it's used for players like Khris (Middleton), Jaylen (Brown) or Jayson (Tatum)"
I love Jayson Tatum his game reminds me of Stanley Johnson who can dribble
"Tim Duncan took a paycut and won in 2014 and was relevant in playoffs until he retired. Case closed.  So this is Lakers FO excuse. How is losing (wasting last few years of Hall of Famer) good for branding? Did you just forget how poor the image of Lakers that time? Some Lakers fans even become Warriors fans and I bet watched more Warriors than Lakers.  Mental gymnastics. 14-16 they got Ingram and Randle whom they failed to develop **quickly**. Worse, sell their potential for proven stars for a trade. This is past Kobe but they picked average Lonzo over All-Star Jayson Tatum. That's all info I need to conclude Lakers FO were just a dumb failure not some shrewd marketer on giving Kobe that contract. They got bailed out by fucking LeBron going Hollywood."
"You’re forgetting the most important part, Jayson Tatum is the focal point of the opposing teams defence."
"The East is weak on front court players this year. Embiid, Giannis, KD, Jayson Tatum, Bam...  Next in line is Someone from the group of Randle, Hayward, Vucevic, Sabonis and Tobias Harris."
Jayson Tatum shoots 14.3 2 pointers per game for context
"He's *scoring* better than Tatum this year, that's indisputable.   However, Tatum is still a much better defender and much better playmaker.   I love Jaylen, but he's quietly becoming overrated in the sense that he's only good at aspects of play that are individual: he can score efficiently and he's a good man defender.   However, his off-ball defense is legitimately awful, and the team's offensive rating sucks whenever he plays without Tatum, which, if he were as good as he is made out to be, wouldn't happen.   Tatum is the guy who still gets the lion share of attention from defenses (blitzed/doubled in PnRs), Tatum is still the guy who Brad trusts to run the offense more than Brown.   Ultimately, for all of Jaylen's progress this year, there's one thing that still hasn't changed from last year:  Whenever Jayson Tatum is on the floor, the Boston Celtics play at the level of a borderline elite team.  Whenever Jayson Tatum is off the floor, the Boston Celtics suck and play at the level of the Minnesota Timberwolves."
&gt;All I meant was he is young enough and talented enough to accomplish a lot. No one else in the league has both those going for them.  Other than Jayson Tatum.
"Well Jordan Clarkson is only 1/4th Asian, he's as Asian as Jayson Tatum is white.  That being said, we all know it ultimately comes down to looks."
Jayson Tatum = Javier Tatuun
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"Kemba costs $6-10M less per year than John Wall and is a better shooter.  Wall is most effective with the ball in his hands, at this point I want the ball with the Jays as much as possible.  Kemba has been bad so far this year but he's coming back off an injury, I am withholding judgement and panic until he's had more time and until Marcus Smart is back.     As soon as Smart comes back, the double big lineup of TT &amp; Theis can go away and it'll be easier for the Celtics to have more playmakers on the floor all the time.  I am still concerned about Kemba's size &amp; issues driving to the rim when it matters, but a 27 PPG Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum mean that Kemba won't need to do as much in the playoffs."
How are you gonna use rookie Ben Simmons as an excuse when he got beaten by rookie Jayson Tatum lmao
"Just makes me sad to think that Jayson Tatum is leaving the Celtics at the end of his contract or requesting a trade in two years. We have a head coach that has been regressing ever since Kyrie broke him, a president/GM that is becoming senile, and fans that constantly think an inferior player (Jaylen Brown) is better. This sad franchise has nothing but history left.  It's over. The rebuild has failed. We have to start over again."

Jazz may want to take their defensive player of the year off the Jayson Tatum assignment
Jayson Tatum &gt; Rudy Gobert
"In no order:  LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Jokic, Doncic, Embiid, Giannis, KD, Harden, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, KAT.   That's 17 players any sane person would take over him just on the basis of being strictly better at basketball. Then when you factor in his questionable mental state I could add on another 15-20 easily. I would say he's around top 30 at best, top 40 at worst."
Jayson Tatum had a sick one just last week.
"Between the Jayson Tatum random bank 3 game winner, and the final possession clock nonsense against the nets (with terrible 3 point shooting), two easily winnable games. Should be fine."
"I feel like I need to explain this better 'cause that is a really bold claim, I know. Hear me out, Brogdon is not a good defender. I could see how Boston fans think he is because he did player really good defense on Jayson Tatum that one game, but he is not a good defender. His size is good, but it comes at a cost, his feet are slow. He gets blown by a lot. Like constantly, his first step might be the slowest in the league for a PG. Myles Turner plugs that gap a lot, but it leads to tons of kickouts to open shooters.    He's not unselfish. His biggest issue as a PG is his inability to create for teammates, because when he drives he almost always does it with his head down. I've never seen so few passes out of drives, it's wild. I say McConnell has been more effective than Brogdon, not better, and this is why. McConnell is a natural creator out of the drive, and it's palpable how much more he collapses defenses, and how many more open looks we get with him on the floor.   Which brings us to he can shoot. He **has** to shoot. And teams have kinda figured it out. Our last three opponents have all started to go under screens cause his shot is a little low and a little slow, and they can recover to him if the go under and cut off the drive which is what has killed us the last 3 games.   People are going to believe the guy below you cause he has a Pacers flair and he's saying the easy narrative to believe because his stats look nice, but please please please really watch a Pacers game, I promise you'll see everything I'm talking about.    Also to back up the McConnell point, McConnell has been a net +11 and Brogdon has been a net -58 in our last three games. I know BPM isn't the best stat, but that isn't nothing."
Looks more like young Jayson Tatum than young Jayson Tatum.
&gt; but Jayson Tatum put up one of the best rookie performances ever  No he wasn't. Get out of here with your nonsense. And if rookie Tatum were on the lakers he 100% would not be starting.
"Your examples make no fucking sense. There are plenty of players who are in the league at age 20, but Jayson Tatum put up one of the best rookie performances ever. Why would compare Horton-Tucker to him?  If Tatum was on the Lakers at 20 there wouldn't be guys ahead of him, its just a bad comparison. It would honestly make more sense to bring up Kawhi. Long athletic guy on a championship team who needed some time to develop his game."
"It's called a dip and it's not as awful as people on here are saying. It's understandable because coaches go crazy over this. It's a rhythm thing. Players who dip before shooting:   * Steph Curry  * Bradley Beal  * JJ Redick * Jayson Tatum * Kevin Durant * Klay Thompson * Fred VanFleet   Should I go on? It doesn't slow the shot down. I don't understand the logic behind why it's bad. You still have to bend your knees and the dip motion happens simultaneously with the lower body. By the time you raise up to shoot, the ball is coming out an the top of the jump."
Jayson Tatum was just a twinkle in his parents eye
"this is fucking absurd. i’ve laughed at lakers fans thinking kuzma is better than jordan clarkson, but JAYSON TATUM???"
"It’s so crazy looking back at what could have been with DSJ. Even after tearing his ACL as a senior he was a top 10 recruit in high school, up with De’Aaron Fox, London Ball, Josh Jackson, Bam Adebayo, Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Jayson Tatum. He then goes to NC State and had a good season, ends up getting drafted 9th overall up there with basically the same stars from his HS class.  People learn how to play defense or shoot 3s later in their career so maybe he could do it. I see the best case for DSJ is to become Lou Williams. The first scoring option off the bench for the 2nd unit, a slasher who also shoots ~35% from 3. Worst case is he ends up being a perpetual 3rd point guard on a team making the minimum."
Kyle Kuzma is better than Jayson Tatum. Perpetuated by many laker fans up until a yea ago
"We talk about the war chest of assets like he didn’t do anything with it but that’s blatantly false. With that war chest he drafted 3 cornerstones in Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart. One high end rotation player in Payton Pritchard. Two high potential young guys in Nesmith and Langford. 3 solid 20 min a night guys in Timelord, Ojeleye, and Williams. To go with that he also traded some of the chest for Kyrie which sadly didn’t go well."
"On offense he definitely was an ideal fit. The Jays struggled to create off the dribble, but Jaylen and Jayson shot the fuck up when it came to shot creation. Jaylen in general and Tatum from the three."
You're tryna bolster Jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum? Good luck
Bulls? Pacers? Teams with one offensive option come crunch time? Yeah sure. The Celtics were the only team with a true chance of beating the Heat with their roster till 2014. Let's not even talk about the field for the 4 years after that. The two best players LeBron faced in 2018 were Jayson Tatum and Victor Oladipo.
We’ll give you Quinn Cook for Jayson Tatum
"Signed Horford, traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.  Ainge gets a weird amount of hate for an absolutely stellar GM."
"""Or"" isn't enough.    Over the past 5 years, Danny brought in:  Isaiah Thomas + Al Horford + Gordon Hayward + Kyrie Irving + Kemba Walker + Jayson Tatum + (soon to be All-Star) Jaylen Brown.   If ""or"" was enough then people would already be satisfied. Danny fell short because he didn't bring in all those guys ""and"" more.  You have to get every single All-Star in the NBA or you are a failure."
"Uhh... Jayson Tatum was the best player for the Celtics in the playoffs and carried the team to game 7 in the ECF against Lebron(and boomed him) when he had just turned 20. Brandon Ingram was averaging 16/5/4 when he had just turned 20. I don’t understand the comparison you’re trying to draw there, there’s other players you could’ve compared him to."
"There are some really bad takes in here. Let me just tell you all this. Before you start talking about it is just the lakers and other nonsense, just watch him play for a few games. The kid *just* turned 20 two months ago. He has forced the best team in the league to move him into the rotation with his play. Think about where Brandon Ingram was when he just turned 20. Where Jayson Tatum was. THT has a long way to go, but he has a really amazing ability to get to the rim and is showing some good defense, as well.  Bottom line is, before you go acting like all the professionals in the league  taking notice of him are so stupid, you should watch him a bit yourself. Nothing in the future is guaranteed, but he has looked very good considering his age and experience."
TB to when Jayson Tatum tweeted this: [@KingJames  Follow back it's Larry Hughes nephew from st. Louis and Abe and Rj Lil cousin and Justin Son Follow Back](https://twitter.com/jaytatum0/status/190937795047596032)
Thanks will take that on board. How do you rate Jayson Tatum as a defender? I’m just curious
I’d trade him for Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.
"If we increase to 4, only two people qualify. James Harden and Jayson Tatum."
Fair point but honestly 1/3 of the way through the season I would expect him to keep it up. Kemba will probably pick it up too but I think it will be hard to outplay Tobias rn especially with jayson tatum and brown
My Friends cousin named Clay locked up Jayson Tatum in a 7th grade game. Dude never stops talking about it
Jayson Tatum with an all time great play in performance
This Jayson Tatum dude gonna be a problem

Jayson Tatum got one of the worst beards in the game
"Regardless of how shit the year has been for the Celtics, at the end of the day they still have Jayson fucking Tatum."
Jayson Tatum had basically shot as many free throws as the entries Wizards team and you all are really trying to say this game is being called fairly...
Jayson Tatum has literally shot more foul attempts than the entire Wizards team... this game hasn’t been called fairly my dude

Jayson Tatum has 0 personality
"I guess watching Jayson Tatum going 50 a game and getting sweep by the Nets will be a fun experience too, for both the celtics and the nets fans."
I’m finally comfortable to admit it. Jayson Tatum is the best player in the NBA.
I was wondering who the analyst was. Not surprised it's Grant Hill. Knew it had to be a Duke guy with the way he's discussed Jayson Tatum all night.
POV you are Jayson Tatum👶
Jayson Tatum is good at basketball
"Jayson Tatum has almost as many FT attempts as the whole Wizards team, and the Wiz has been getting their points mostly from the paint"
Why did the most successful franchise in the eastern conference have to luck into Jayson Tatum man?! 😑
Need the Raptors to draft a Jayson Tatum type of talent expeditiously!!
Jayson 'Tater Tot' Tatum
Sometimes when I’m sad I remember the Celtics are the team with Jayson Tatum and everything is happy
He’s only (looks up Jayson Tatum) 23 years old
Hmmm this Jayson Tatum kid is good
Jayson Tatum woke up feeling dangerous 😈   5-15 FG 🔥 2-6 3P 😮
In what universe does Jayson Tatum get second team all nba this year
"For no particular reason I think a ""duo"" of a pass first veteran point guard, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams would be awesome HAHAHAHA jk but what if?"
"Teams sit players who don't help their team all the time, don't usually sit players who help their team. That's why if you watch this game tonight you'll see a lot more Jayson Tatum than Tacko Fall."
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
"My point is it varies quite a lot person to person. These players have to play a high stress sport on the highest level. Any compromise in their lung activity can seriously hamper them. We saw this with Jayson Tatum as well, where he was much worse after his Covid experience, but gradually got better as he recovered. To downplay the effects of Covid is stupid and really insensitive."
Would you rather have the Fauci Ouchie for a couple days or end up with chronic lung disease like Jayson Tatum?
Fuck Jayson tatum
"Honestly not. Wizards is a worst team than the Celtics. Plus Westbrook fans are the worst out there, so any chance to fuel their craziness is absolutely to avoid imho.   Also Stevens is a far far superior coach than Brooks, I think he could put in trouble the Nets more.  For the general NBA fans would be better to see Tatum vs KD matchup, I think Jayson is one of the fewest out there to match with him. Also the Celtics has a defensive structure to resist more the Nets, and I'm only sad that there wouldn't be Brown out there.  So I literally don't see a single good reason to Wath a Nets vs Wizards matchup rather than one with the Celtics, if not to show off what could have been if the OKC traded Russ rather than Harden (that would have been the right thing to do in 2012 and Harden is still a far superior player than Russ)."
"Yeah sure buddy, how did fultz pan out instead of a Jayson Tatum? Talking shit about Ainge is one of the dumbest thing someone can do when it comes to the celtics and don't worry, we even have idiots like you that cheer for the celtics and act ignorant about ainge."
Jayson Tatum will probably do it next year when he is 20.
"Jayson Tatum is an incredible player, but that was a pretty flukey game winner lol. The only other game winner I can think of that was even more flukey than this one was the Kawhi game winner over the 6ers."

"What would be the actual most selfish big 3 in the league right now? Maybe I'm like Devjn Booker, Jayson Tatum and Giannis?  But even then I could see that working out pretty well. We don't really have a Kobe in the league right now.  Maybe Westbrook would not like to be on a team where other guys are taking away his assists?"
Toppin goes like 13th or something. He's the same age as Jayson Tatum and it isn't clear what his path to being a good NBA player is

Doesn't top the Jayson Tatum explosion.
"Yo a little fun fact for the Knicks fans: Randle is leading the league in minutes played with 2583, over 100 more minutes than second place jokic at 2471. By the time you get to just 11th place in the whole league, Jayson Tatum, it's all the way down to 2263. That's insane durability and stamina"

Would you rather take the chance on long term side effects from the virus itself or the vaccine? Assuming the vaccine has any, which it doesn't."

"I mean, I'd take the Knicks straight up over the Celtics right now. Especially at home.   And the Celtics can't move up or down after this game. The only thing they can do is rest their players since they have a game two days later and have no reason to make it the third game in four nights that their starters are playing. I'm not sure putting the Heat in the Sixers bracket so they can maybe play them in the second round in a series the Sixers would be favored in anyway is worth screwing themselves over for.   In fact, I'd go so far as to say willingly putting your starters including your young star, Jayson Tatum, in a three games in four night scenario for the *chance* to *maybe* *kinda* screw over your rival would be the dumbest move I've ever seen from an organization.   Meanwhile the Knicks have everything to play for."
"You'll be ok. Remember that even with long covid, Jayson Tatum has been able to play and has actually played more mins per game since. He plays in the nba, if it was actually bad the man wouldn't be playing haha."
"Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Luol Deng, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert for the 2 or fewer allstar appearance players."
Jayson Tatum
"Jayson Tatum says he still doesn’t feel normal, he had it four months ago."
"Mediocre after years of having an attrocious record and giving the Celtics two top 3 picks that became Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. I think you're forgetting how bad they were for that 3-4 year stretch after that trade.  They don't necessarily need lottery picks; it's not picks that win trades, but players, and players picked. If the Rockets can get one all star calibre with any of the Nets picks, or if they can package them for a superstar player, then it's definitely a win for the Rockets, maybe even win-win if the Nets can get a chip."
Jaylen brown jayson tatum and marcus smart is highway robbery for old pierce and kg. The issue is the rest of their assets they didnt capitalize on. Boston 100 percent robbed the nets but they fucked themselves in the foot by not doing anything at all with those other picks
"But he is not a big and everyone knows that. Is Jayson Tatum a big? No, because that’s not how it works."

Luka or Jayson Tatum?
&gt; You have a better case of comparing Cade to Jayson Tatum then Simmons.  That's by far the most common comp I've seen.  He's really close to Tatum.  I've never even seen him compared to Simmons.
Kyle kuzma is the same as jayson Tatum
"i just imagine if danny ainge traded Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown after 3 seasons for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and a couple FRPs.  he wouldn't have stepped down as GM, he would've been absolutely chased out of town with pitchforks.  and the Celtics will be lucky if Tatum or Brown becomes anywhere near as great a player as Harden.  to Presti's credit, i do think he is particularly good at evaluating college talent.  but that is where his good qualities as a GM end."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Jayson Tatum.  He's trash compared to people's opinion of him, especially Celtics fans. He takes bad shots And a lot of them. He doesn't create good looks for his team mates. He takes away team mates opportunities. He's far too inconsistent, which again hurts the team, is he gonna shoot 3/20 tonight and get blown out by the Bulls, hit 3/15 and lose to the Wizards or go 20/30 and beat the Nets, who knows just roll a dice. Guess his teammates just hope Tatum pops off? Cause they aren't getting enough ball to get any rhythm going if he doesn't.  The more the Celtics rely on Tatum, and the less they have other players on court taking and creating shots the worse they do. I swear the Celtics roster should perform better every season, but they do worse year on year.  I also think that the way Tatum plays, he makes the players around him worse, like the opposite of the CP3 effect. Like for example, Evan Fornier joins the team and goes from scoing 19ppg to 13ppg despite the fact his shooting percentages went up. On the flip side, Thies had the opposite effect, he moved to the Bulls and his PPG went up, despite his 2pt% staying the same and his 3pt% going down... Look at everyone else who joined this team? Tristan Thompson went from 12ppg to 7ppg, Kemba went from 26ppg to 19ppg. Who could forget scary Terry? MF went from 9ppg to 20ppg. No player has joined this team and gotten better and all of them who left suddenly improved and everyone acts like it's a God damn mystery. Everyone just forgot the fact Rozier got a massive pay day? Dude looked great, but just never got his chance, and guess what he balled out when he was given the chance. If it wasn't predictable why did the Hornets pay him so much and let Kemba walk?   As Tatum's usage rate goes from 10% to 30%, the Celtics go from a Win % of 70% to 50%... Despite what everyone expected was to be the Celtics getting stronger every season due to their high draft stock and already strong roster with guys like Brown, Smart, Irving/Walker, while the team had Hayward on the roster taking the bulk of the salary space AND being out with injury.  He's a great player, with great potential, but his game has major floors which need to be fixed. He's an above average player, on an okay team. But jesus people suck him off like he's in MVP contention despite only going 36-36 with a very decent surrounding cast.   Like if you said to me 2 years ago, there will be a team with: Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, an All NBA calibur player, Jaylen Brown, Tristan Thompson starting and a bench of Fornier, Teague,  Parker, Williams and Thies, I'd say holy shit that's a top 4 team. But no just 7th in the East, 36-36 record. What?"
"The 06 Finals were rigged for Miami. The NBA betting scandal was discovered the next year.  Paul pierce and dwade are pretty even all time, numbers/accolades aside.  Lebrons skills as a GM cost him a ring  KG is the greatest PF all time because Duncan played more minutes at center.  Jokic will have more rings when he retires than Luka.  Jayson Tatum will end up being the best player of his generation. ie when lebron/curry/KD/Harden retire he is the next man up.  Tyler Herro will be a career bench player   Volume Off-ball scoring is the most valuable skill in the game.  Forcing all rookies to play there first year in the G-league or be  at least 21 years old would make the league substantially better to watch.  The next big thing teams are overlooking is offensive rebounding. It will be the new 3pt shooting.  David Stern was an asshole but a great commissioner."
Jayson Tatum is overrated
"It was discussed that it was Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Salary + Picks (#14, #16, and the super-valuable-before-Ja Memphis pick) to bring AD in to play with Kyrie, Smart, Horford, and Hayward. That was unequivocally off the table once Davis had his fucking dad come out to bat against Boston.   NOLA wanted Tatum over any other player at the time.   Celtics could have easily beaten the Lakers offer by a significant gap. There was just no longer a bidding war because Davis was just going to leave in FA because the Lakers could have just cut cap space the next season and sign him outright.   Side note: KD sign+trade for Hayward was the next logical move the following season when KD wanted to come team up with Kyrie.   Think of a Jrue Holliday, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, and Robert Williams Pelicans core and a Kyrie, Smart, KD, AD, and Horford + ring chasers Celtics.   Makes me feel dirty as a Celtics fan but wouldn't it have been better for basketball? Pelicans drafted a potentially generational player and still couldn't build a competitive team with that Lakers roster."
"Like, say Jayson Tatum? Which was a way more welcomed AMA by redditors even though that was also sponsored by ruffles?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mz19ft/hi_rnba_im_jayson_tatum_of_the_boston_celtics_and/"
Jayson Tatum would be an MIP candidate once Kyrie left Boston or that Oladipo would become an all star after leaving the Thunder
"He's a 3rd-year undersized guard averaging 27ppg over the last 2 years on 59% TS. What more do you possibly want from him?  He's more efficient than Jaylen Brown, along with Jayson Tatum who you probably think is the next coming of Christ."
higher TS% than both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown... yikes
"He’s more efficient than jayson Tatum, and you’re not using nearly enough stats to get the whole picture of his playmaking ability, or you could just watch him, either works."
Jayson Tatum
"To put into context for others who think Bam is old, he was in the 2017 draft class which included; Markelle Fultz, Lonzo, Jayson Tatum, De'aaron, Jarret Allen, Kuzma, Josh Hart, Lauri Markkanen, and Frank Nilikina."
Jayson Tatum
This must mean that Tyler Herro &gt; Jayson Tatum.
"MVP: Jayson Tatum (yeah you probably think I’m crazy but I saw multiple guys say Trae young so this seems justified)   MIP: Jordan Poole  6moty: Dennis Schroder, I mean a lot of people have been shitting on him and just acting like he is a bad player so I think he’s gonna try and prove everyone wrong  DPOY: as much as I hate him Ben Simmons   ROTY; Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green"
"In this modern era, your franchise's developmental program is nowhere near top 3. You sign a lot of guys that are already established and do away with your young talent. A lot of other franchises have that player that they can say they developed into something big. The Jazz has Donovan Mitchell. The Hawks have Trae Young. The Celtics have Jayson Tatum. The Heat have Bam Adebayo. The Pelicans had Anthony Davis and has Zion. The only guy I can see potentially fit that bill for y'all is THT, but only if you keep him."
well for starters he literally said he thinks he could be jayson tatum so he’s kinda doing it to himself
Jayson Tatum said he also didn’t touch a basketball for most of the lockdown. Didn’t seem to affect him much. Just admit Siakam got locked down and exposed by Jaylen
"Jayson Tatum, when he dunked on and got up in Lebron face. But the basketball fan in me know that he is a future star in this league."
Jayson Tatum?
Jayson Tatum or Glen Davis
Paul George is directly better than Jayson Tatum at everyhting.
&gt;6th man  &gt;Jayson Tatum  Wut
2. Jason Terry  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Tyson Chandler  5. Jayson Tatum  6. Dwayne Wade  7. Kawhi Leonard  I probably flunked it
Kyrie left that same offseason and based on how the relationship soured AD wouldn’t have made him stay especially when he was going to join KD in his hometown. Now AD brown and Tatum is a great team but better than Lebron &amp; AD ehh I don’t think so and that leaves you with 3 non shot creators as you’re 3 best players and no one to optimize them. Not to mention that you were losing brown to trade for AD. No way David griffin or the previous GM does that trade without brown. So now Jayson Tatum and AD without a good shot creator is definitely worse than Lebron and AD. So they probably again sign Kemba to replace Kyrie and we all know how that worked out. So no way they’ve won a ring by this point and I don’t think their near future would look anywhere near as good as the Lakers do right now so you’re already starting to waste ADs prime years. Obviously hypotheticals create ripple effects of other events that we can’t foresee but I again just don’t see how that could possibly translate into a greater than 4 year real title window. Kawhi was never staying in Toronto they literally did everything they possibly could achieve to get him to stay and he didnt and they definitely did not have as good of a package to trade as the lakers. And Lebron at 40 will be a top 30 player easy lol. He has skills that would translate at a high level if he lost 50% of his athleticism.
"Not defensive rating, the stat that says jayson tatum is worse then Steph at D lol"
"Yeah ""a good return"" is not the same as Jayson Tatum"
Jayson Tatum. That boy been 19 for 5 years now
"Jayson Tatum  I know I'm wrong, I just don't like him."
"Jayson Tatum records 50 PTS, 6 REB, 7 AST, 2 STL &amp; 1 BLK  He became the 3rd youngest player with a 50 point playoff game in NBA History  He tied Larry Bird for the most 50-point games in Celtics franchise history."
Jayson Tatum
Zion. He is basically a guy who can dunk at a high clip. He doesn’t defend or do anything outside of the paint.  His ex coach called him and the team out for not defending. And everyone has hyped him up to be this great player and we haven’t seen him take over games or win at all. He is always on list of top players under 25 whiles guys like Jayson Tatum who have won a lot or guys like Ja who contributed to the team being somewhat respectable.
Kyle Kuzma straight up  on one hand he does everything better than Jayson Tatum. The best player in the 2017 draft by far  on the other hand is a 6’9 Ellen Degeneres who can’t playmake for shit. An ISO scorer who can’t hit a 3 and has some wack workout music coz **wOe WoE**
Yeah... and Jayson Tatum is 7ft
Meanwhile the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in those very same drafts (very much NOT the consensus picks) but clowns on nba reddit will STILL insist Ainge is overrated trash lol
"what in the fuck yes he did  his biggest competition the past few years in the east was a teenage jayson tatum, demar derozan, kyle lowry, victor oladipo, and a young paul george  you gotta be smoking nuts to think he wasn't in the absolute weakest conference all those years  plus on top of that the dude would get to the finals and LOSE to the western team more times than not"
"Jayson Tatum sidestep 3    He does it so quickly and creates so much space with his massive step that he can get it off against any defender. It’s such a difficult shot that’s requires a ton of balance, quickness, and precise footwork, but Tatum hits it so consistently that it’s a good shot."
Remember when Jayson Tatum was 6’10 last summer. Good times
"And considering who Tatum became. If Philly had Jayson Tatum right now I’d be willing to bet that they wouldn’t care quite as much about the Simmons return and would’ve traded him a little sooner. They also maybe wouldn’t have felt like they needed Tobias Harris around as well given that positionally Tatum can fill his role and be far far far far far better in it.  Edit: with that said, I believe the Celtics would’ve still taken Tatum #1."
"The real truth is there's plenty of blame to go around. In no particular order, I blame:  1. Adam Silver giving into NBA ownerships and agents pleas by installing Jerry Colangelos and his big-collared son, which led to us making a lot of short sided decisions that drained a lot of assets acquired by Hinkie.  2. Josh Harris and the ownership group being absolutely boneheaded greedy bloodsuckers at every turn.  3. Fultz straight up forgetting how to play basketball, and drafting him over Jayson Tatum.  3. Choosing to give Tobias Harris a max contract over Jimmy Butler.  4. Ben Simmons inability to improve at any level on the offensive end.  5. Hiring Doc Rivers.  Etc, etc. This franchise has continuously just makes wrong decision after wrong decision."
Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum
"The problem there is everyone acts like he can't also catch fire and just pop off for big games without a ton of it being free throws. No one appreciates the games he is a flamethrower because yeah, when cold, he seeks the comfort of that free throw line lol. But it's not like his 60 and 50 point games, or his year of averaging almost 40 he had 20 free throws a game. Maybe 10, which is still 30 a night making very tough shots carrying the rockets without cp3 at the time.   Yet when someone like Jayson Tatum, who doesn't get to the line a lot, goes off for 40 and 19 of them are free throws, it's like he is praised. That's just a random example, I like Tatum lol"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
The process was to get multiple generational talents to set themselves up for a championship. If they took Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown instead of Simmons and Fultz they’d be in that position but their drafting/scouting/development  was subpar
Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum has everything but the chip and that will happen pretty soon
"Jayson Tatum. He's already in a ton of advertising, he plays for the Celtics, he has Best-In-League potential, and he's American. I see no reason he won't be the next face"
Jayson Tatum is still 16
"Not biased at all, but Jayson Tatum"
"?  are you 1) denying that Tatum had Covid, or 2) denying that Covid affected him?  well let's ask [Tatum himself](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31254061/boston-celtics-jayson-tatum-fighting-covid-19-effects-close-100-percent-performance-picks-up):  &gt; Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum said Tuesday night that he is still dealing with the after-effects of contracting for COVID-19 three months ago and has been using an inhaler before games as a means to combat them.  &gt; ""Close,"" he said, after scoring 32 points, along with nine rebounds and five assists, in a 116-115 Boston victory in Portland, when asked whether he's back to 100 percent. ""Very close.  3 months later he was still using in inhaler and not back to 100%. in the same interview he said that he felt a lot better than he did a month prior, and he was playing basketball that whole time.   But back to your point, just because Tatum posted his best offensive season doesn't mean Covid didn't ""take it out of him"" on offense for a couple months. Anyone who watched him can tell you that he was hindered on offense for a while, but he's such a good shooter that he got by during that period. The difference before and after Covid was apparent to the eyes."
The KG and Pierce trade. Still the dumbest trade I’ve seen in my life. Even worse is that those first round pick Boston got ended up being Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in the future. Well at least we got the big 3
There's zero things on the basketball court that Tatum does as well as Paul George. Maybe like post moves. At the same age Paul George was going toe to toe with Miami heat. Don't get it mistook a good career for Jayson Tatum would be to end up like Paul George minus the three major injuries.
"Jayson Tatum Ruffles: 1  Paul George Ruffles: 0  I’m not saying anything, I’m just putting out the numbers for the rest of the world"
Norman Powell fouling Jayson Tatum trying to get the rebound after Grant Williams missed both Free Throws in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.
Bro our best player that year was rookie Jayson Tatum who we DIDN'T EVEN FEED AFTER HE POSTERIZED LEBRON IN GAME 7. You can't seriously call us the '55-win Celtics' when we were missing our best and only All-NBA performer in the playoffs from that team.
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
When did the lakers trade for Jayson Tatum
They should include Jayson and Deuce Tatum
moody+jordan poole HAS to be enough for jayson tatum right????
"&gt; was Lowry on that team? was PJ and Kieff? and you said Dragic's big production is not replicable but also criticize them for last season?  I was referring to Herro/Butler/Bam.  &gt;you're also overrating Butler in the playoffs that year based on what he did in the Finals. his first 3 rounds are in line with how he usually produces  Yes, and then what happened to his production the following year, the most recent playoffs?  &gt;based on Trae's elite playmaking ability...?  Both are elite scorers, one is an elite playmaker, one is an elite defender. Conclusion? Neither one is clearly better than the other. Same tier.  &gt;LOL that is pure delusion. if Robert Williams and Josh Richardson are 2 of your starters, you better hope you have an All-Star coming off the bench  Williams is fine starter material, it's J-Rich who is concerning but all 4 of these teams have some form of a weak link in their starting lineup.  &gt;yeah and the difference is Trae Young...which is a star the Celtics don't have  They have Jayson Tatum, they'll be fine. Either you're overrating Trae or underrating Tatum, as they're both top 12-15."
"I do wonder if our definition of what's neutral or good is different. To be clear I'm talking about his impact and fact he is a center generally helps that.  I can see your point as well though. While Jokic grades as slight positive on most defensive impact metrics LA-DRAPM does have him as slight negative.  In any case overall I guess it comes down to what you consider neutral defense for example. If you compare him to other anchor big's you could say he's below average, however most anchor big's tend to be above average.  On D-LEBRON his last season (0.61) grades him as around top 75 defender out of 247 players that played over 1000mins that season. This would put him among players like KAT, Jayson Tatum, Maxi Kleber, Montrezl Harrell and Pascal Siakam.   For me I would consider most guys in this 0.3 - 1.0 range to be slight positives on defense. Usually these are players that have at least few notable issues or limitations that stop them from being clear positive, but who also have some strong points and do enough to where you can be fairly certain that at least they aren't hurting their teams on that end. I think alongside of Jokic KAT and Josh Jackson are really good examples of this."
"The NBA is not soft in terms of defense. The offense is just better than it was before. Defense will always remain the same because of the limited stuff you can do in defense. Offenses will continue to evolve over time.   Mid range jump shots will always be the key to winning team no matter what era. The best offensive perimeter players prove this. (MJ, Kobe, KD, LeBron, Steph, Bird, etc). Pretty confident the team stats will back this up too. Feel free to fact check this.   Physical defense does not mean better defense  Jayson Tatum, DBook, Jaylen Brown, BI, Bam have already peaked. Can’t see any further development in these guys.   MJ had less expectations coming in the league compared to Bron.   This maybe a preference thing but I would rather take a longer lasting prime than the highest peak ever for 3-5 years.   Robert Horry is a HoF candidate just not first ballot. (Sam Jones already set this precedent)  Reggie Miller is overrated. His legacy is built upon his moments and elevated playoff play only."
"&gt;The worst team lebron played in the finals is better than the best team Jordan played   2011 Mavs is not better than the 90's Jazz lol, or the '93 Suns or '96 Sonics for that matter. Plus, its not like Lebron had a better team than the Bad Boy Pistons in his own conference.  &gt;Imagine being guarded by Danny Ainge and Jeff hornasec in finals after finals instead of defensive players of the year like Leonard and green  Two can play this game. Imagine being guarded by JJ Barea, Demar Derozan and rookie Jayson Tatum instead of prime Rodman, Gary Payton, Joe Dumars and John Starks.   &gt;yet lebron has much better finals performances  Really? Lebron averages 28/10/8 on 48% FG and 4 turnovers per game in the finals. Jordan averages 34/6/6 on 48% FG and 3 turnovers per game in the finals."
Jayson Tatum is not an elite midrange shooter.
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. That's the answer you seek.
"Depending on how big of a leap they take, I could absolutely see players like LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, and Ja Morant becomes cultural influences for the league, actively seeking the spotlight. Even superstars right now like AD, Embiid, and Jayson Tatum are showing me that."
I dont get with the set supermaxes by the league whats the point of having an agent if you’re a player like Jayson Tatum who’s gonna get the max every contract. I say just get rid of em

"&gt; NBA agent Rich Paul says he warned the Boston Celtics about trading for Anthony Davis for their own good.   &gt;Paul told ESPN’s Dave McMenamin — in a report Tuesday about how the All-NBA big man’s blockbuster deal from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Los Angeles Lakers went down — **that he tried to persuade other suiters, like the Celtics, against mortgaging their future for Davis.**  &gt; “The last thing you want to do is put a GM in a situation where he trades away an asset and then the guy walks out the door,” he said. “Like, you can’t do business that way. So it’s not really a hard conversation to have.”  &gt; Paul — who represents a number of high-profile stars, including Davis and his new Lakers teammate LeBron James — **had made it clear at the time that his 26-year-old client would likely leave in free agency next summer if the Celtics acquired him from the Pelicans.**  &gt;“I don’t think it stopped Danny Ainge from trying,” he told ESPN.  &gt;The Celtics had tried to compete with the Lakers’ trade offers last June and some fans urged the team to go all in for Davis, a franchise-caliber talent. Ainge has reportedly coveted the six-time All-Star for years. However, according to Paul, he ultimately “wasn’t willing to give up the young players.” While the Celtics were reportedly open to trading some combination of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Marcus Smart, they weren’t willing to match the package of players and draft picks that the Lakers ultimately sent to the Pelicans for Davis — especially if he might leave Boston after one season.   &gt;“I don’t blame him,” Paul said. “I wouldn’t give them up either if the guy is not going to re-sign.”  &gt;Davis had narrowed his preferred destinations to the Lakers and the New York Knicks — and Paul pushed to make sure other teams knew that. **David Griffin, the Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations, told ESPN that Paul “had done such an effective job of smoking out all of the competition” that the team realized they wouldn’t get a better deal than what had been offered by the Lakers.**  &gt;**In May, Paul told Sports Illustrated that the Celtics could trade for Davis, “but it’ll be for one year.” Shortly after Davis first requested a trade in February, his father also spoke out against the idea of his son playing for the Celtics, “after what they [had] done to Isaiah Thomas,” who was traded for Kyrie Irving while recovering from a hip injury he sustained during the 2017 playoffs, which derailed his career.**  &gt;Paul didn’t express opposition to the concept of Davis playing for the Celtics, but said he made the risk clear to the team.  &gt;“**If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020,” he told SI. “I’ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don’t blame Rich Paul.”**  The 'Ainge has no loyalty' narrative was steaming hot at this time and the quote was used at the perfect time when Celtics seemed ready to finally pull the trigger on AD now that it was clear he wasn't staying in New Orleans. Just seems awfully coincidental."
JAYSON TATUM
"Gobert signed an extension worth more AAV than Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, Karl-Anthony Towns and Devin Booker, who're all franchise cornerstones. But his value isn't at the level of any of these players in the playoffs."

rudy gay. harrison barnes. jayson tatum
Idk like Jayson Tatum and assets
Ans the fact that Jayson Tatum was passed over twice for a complete bust and a role player only compounds  it.
Jaywatch. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown
Jayson Tatum gets away with it everytime too
"but that's what people mean when they say ""young players,"" people who haven't played a bunch of nba basketball  like Jayson Tatum is 23 but I don't think anyone would describe him as a ""young player"" at least from a mentorship prespective"
He’s good tho  Jayson Tatum better but still
Good thing I said on the court. This thread is on fire for making dumb comments. I read it as each team having 2-3 NBA guys. Its Not at all uncommon to have 5 NBA guys in a college game.  This seems like a really hard concept for you guys so I’ll just list guys that came from college recently I guess  Trae Young Jayson Tatum Donavon Mitchel Devon Booker Zion  And a lot of these guys played against each other. These are not the guys at the end of the bench. They are superstars. Which means there’s future superstars in college games. Is this confusing? I’ll slow down if I’m going to fast
"Let’s see the picks that surrounded them. Tatum was chosen over the consensus first overall pick Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Jackson.   Jaylen was drafted over Dragan Bender and Kriss Dunn.   Marcus Smart was drafted next to Nik Stauskas, Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum, and Jabari Bird.  At what point are we gonna dispel the idea that just because you are drafting high means that the pick is going to work out. It’s absolutely crazy to not reward GM’s for making the correct pick, even high in the draft.   Jayson is the best player out of everybody in his draft class. Jaylen is the best player in his as well (I personally think he’s better than Simmons because Simmons can just get schemed out in the playoffs and has been in the past).   I seriously don’t know why people use this as an argument."

"Yeah this isn’t the east bro, 19 year old Jayson Tatum and all star al Horford aren’t your biggest threats. An injured Miami Heat took you to 6"
"Lebron James:  “If I could come back, in the NBA, I want to be Jayson Tatum.  I don’t want to get boomed on because I want to keep my knees good and all that.  I want to be that f***ing Tatum:  come out of preschool; boom people anytime I want, ultra green jersey, be so good (x4),  just go home after and work out with me this summer.”"
"There are roughly 10 teams that could win this year, so your first options are Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic.  Mitchell is easily the worst of the bunch."
We talking about Boston “no interior presence” with Jayson “never met a fade-away he didn’t like” Tatum and confused about free throws?
"Jayson Tatum and Rob Williams are the only players worth building around on this team. Danny Ainge needs to consider everybody else in trade packages, even the “heart and soul of the team”, Marcus Smart.  Tatum and Rob Williams deserve better teammates and a better coach."
Got so many jays they call me Jayson Tatum
Can you believe Jayson Tatum is 8’5?
Rodney Hood for Jayson Tatum seems like a fair trade to me
"I think a Dame, Curry, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Jokic line-up would be pretty, pretty good."
"He’d be the perfect center alongside Zion. I would be thrilled if the Pelicans were able to pull something together. They give the Pacers Steven Adams, one of Nickeil, Jaxon, Kira, and a draft pick a couple years down the road? Probably would have to give up another young piece/draft pick, but of all these teams, they have the most attractive collection of assets to make that trade. My big dream is either Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum wants out of Boston by the beginning of next season and the Pels make a big trade for one of them. Who the team gets to finish off their Big 3 is going to determine what kind of success the team has during Zion’s early days."
Hopefully : Jayson Tatum  Realistically : Me
"https://thesportsdaily.com/2018/03/14/your-morning-dump-where-ball-slippage-is-a-problem-for-jayson-tatum/  Not sure what to tell you, it's a commonly talked about issue in Boston. He's never palmed the ball in a game before. Maybe he needs to push the ball against the ground to palm it, but he can't do it in any practical way."
"... that’s not my point.   The whole OP explains why Nets half court defense isn’t as bad as advertised. You mentioned the change of style during the playoffs, and they lean towards the Nets defense.   My point is even with a highly rated defense like the Miami Heat last year, stopping them when the game slows down is impossible. In fact, based on the logic of the OP, getting stopped by them might be more probable.  This isn’t Giannis and Khris Middleton or Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown."
"As a completely unbiased Philadelphia 76ers fan who has love for every and all teams, I’ll have to say Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics (:  (But truthfully I’d say Donovan Mitchell or Murray cuz they were awesome in that playoff series in front of lots of viewers but right now aren’t those same players and haven’t been usually. Maybe they will be but so far those games are the exception not the rule)"
7 comments in and 3 people have said Jayson Tatum. If enough people say he's overrated then he's not really overrated
Either Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell
"That's all accurate, but the real variable was that while he was out, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown BOTH ended up not only NBA players, but the type of guys you re-sign and build around. It's kind of unprecedented that both of them ended up working out like they did, basically because they were forced into the minutes by Hayward's injury. Very few people besides Jaylen Brown himself thought he would grow into what he is now, a lot of Celtics fans hated that draft pick because we already had one athletic guard who can't shoot in Marcus Smart.   So, does this same thing happen, or happen anywhere near this quickly if Hayward doesn't get hurt like that? Or, if one of Tatum or Brown happens to be just meh or a bust, is there still room for Hayward? It's just crazy because none of it is his fault, but there was no spot in Boston for him to do what he's doing now"
"Also drafting Tatum went against the Hinkie philosophy entirely. So even keeping Hinkie would have meant missing on Tatum.  He was entirely consensus BPA focused with little consideration for fit or specific talents. The Process^TM was 'let's be as bad as possible and bring in as many consensus talents as possible, we'll figure out the rest later.'  That's why Hinkie drafted Nerlens, Okafor and Embiid in succession.   He wasn't going to reach for the #4 pick in a draft where everyone was focused on the top 3. Especially since Fultz was considered a consensus safe #1 pick.  Jaylen and Jayson were reaches that really only Ainge was going to make. They fit the archetypes he'd been hunting for years."
Jaylen Brown &gt; Jayson Tatum
I enjoyed 2017-2018 Celtics. Seeing a rookie Jayson Tatum face off against Lebron was fun
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
Is the thumbnail a sad Jayson Tatum with Exposed written in huge red block letters?
"""Jayson Tatum EXPOSED as a fraud bum"" is already in the works"

"That’s fair. But out of Bron, Giannis, Harden, Kd, Steph, Ad, Embid, Jokic, Luka, Dame, Kyrie, Kawhi, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, who can Middleton go above? Plus there’s still arguments for Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Beal, Lavigne, and Mitchell over Middleton."
Why are people asking you about Jayson Tatum so much?
People ask me about jayson Tatum all the time. I always say most overrated player in the game
It also took me way too long to realize Jae'Sean Tate was a player and not just the houston announcer pronouncing Jayson Tatum in a southern accent
"Well Jayson Tatum is only 19, so he must be more valuable than both of them"
The timberwolves dont have Jayson Tatum lol.  Its Towns followed by a whole lot of garbage (and the guys who aren't complete trash can't stay on the court).  And then there's the coaching situation
"Yea, as a Celtics fan who was unsure of how he was doing, I thought that it was nice to see improvements for RJ since I was high on him coming into college. Tatum had a shit season but that was partly to blame off the massive expectations off his rookie season. RJ is improving and I don't know why people are so pressed to give out all this ""context"" for whats supposed to be a quick numbers comparison. Doesn't matter what you call it, Jayson was trying to pull off Kobe's moveset with a high end role players skill."
Yes but Jayson Tatum is 3 years old so...
"I agree. There's a couple more players you can bunch into that group of ""over hyped"": Jayson Tatum and Devin Booker. That's not to say that they're bad, but their hype doesn't match reality. ESPN had Jayson Tatum ranked over Jokic as young players you would start your team around."

What? We are waiting for Beal to be a free agent because he is best friends with Jayson Tatum.
"You say that he sits on his hands when he has made multiple big time trades (one that even won a championship) in his tenure. Recently we made the Kyrie trade which was a massive deal. We also traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford, we traded Pierce and KG for the picks that got us Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown + more, we traded for Kevin Garnett and went from the worst team in the league to the NBA champions the next year, we traded for Isaiah Thomas who became 4th in MVP voting. This narrative is straight bullshit. This sub seems to think that we need to make a major roster shaking deal each year which is straight up dumb. Our 2 best players are 23 and 24, we have no reason to rush the process and shorten their championship window to win now when neither of them are in their prime yet."
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"

Trae Young  Kawhi Leonard  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Jayson Tatum  Bam Adebayo  LaMelo Ball  Are the only current players winning an MVP in their careers
Most overrated player: jayson Tatum
"Every time people ask me who’s overrated, I always say it’s gotta be jayson Tatum.   He’s overrated"
"Most franchises should wish they had Tatum and Brown  While everyone is trashing Ainge I’d also like to bring up the fact that he turned Markelle Fultz into Jayson Tatum and a pick - I mean, maybe Langford doesn’t develop into anything, but that’s a DEAL"
which counts as more points? 3 points or 2.2 assists?   IMO he should have been in over jayson tatum. volume scorer on less than league average efficiency. not as good on defense as Bam or Ben. same record as the heat. why did the celtics deserve two all stars?
"Whenever people ask me about overrated nba players, I say jayson Tatum"
"It depends, some people hit their prime around 24 but I think 26-28 is most common. It will be interesting to see with the league skewing younger what the affect will be for guys like Jayson Tatum who is practically a veteran and still 5 years away what should be his peak. Steph had a very different route so his was probably around 28-30 and waning since. Doesn’t mean he isn’t any good, just means the risk increases as minutes are pushed"

"Bradley Beal convinced Jayson Tatum to go to Chaminade High School. They’ve been buddies for years, sadly Ainge won’t do a deal that he absolutely doesn’t fleece the other side."
"Gotta love watching Jaylen run with the bench scrubs that wouldn’t even get minutes on the other team to start the fourth quarter meanwhile the only guy consistently hitting shots, Jayson, sits on the bench, as we go down double digits.  Then Jayson comes in and immediately makes two beautiful shots and cuts the lead to like five drawing a double team also to lead to an easy bucket. What do we do after that you may be asking? Give the ball to Jaylen Brown, and Kemba for a few plays, but mostly Jaylen Brown to miss shot after shot and turn it over, over and over again. I know what your thinking, genius game plan by Brad because then he lets Tatum loose the last two minutes so you can go crazy? Nah. Instead we give it to the guy living on Antarctica over there.  Great game plan Brad, very inspirational.  Also, would like to here your opinions. Do you think Silver comes up to Brad before every game and tells him if he uses his challenge Adam will kill a puppy?  None of that really matters tho. Still fun to watch because we had a couple good scores off of in bounds plays.  On a serious note, every game Marcus Smart plays he moves up on my favorite players of all time list (well mostly every game). Glad he is back."
"&gt; Jayson Tatum looks back. Jaylen Brown. 5/23, 4 turnovers. &gt;  &gt; Get Tatum more help!  Imagine a scenario where a team could have potentially traded said player in a package for ""one of the greatest players in NBA history"""
If only Jayson Tatum had a subway sub that would help put points on the board
"Jayson Tatum looks to his friend Kyrie. He has James Harden, one of the greatest players in NBA history.  Jayson Tatum looks back. Jaylen Brown. 5/23, 4 turnovers.  Get Tatum more help!"

"Lamelo Ball, Ja Morant, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion Williamson, Luka Doncic"
"&gt;And had the worst record in the league and never sniffed the playoffs. Your point? We were talking about playoff teams both of them have played on.  He was a rookie and played 33 games...  My point is that you lied.   &gt;I'm not blamin him at all, those teams were trash, but no one is makin an actual effective argument detailing Embiid's playoff success because he has zilch.   Wow...  First of all, Embiid is a stretch 5 who shoots mid-range and 3s so naturally his FG% is going to be lower. This is why we use EFG% and TS%.  Second of all, he literally took the eventual champions to 7 games.  &gt;He shoots &lt;45% in the playoffs as a 7'0"" Center   Dude, are you just gonna continue to make shit up? TIL 45.9% &lt; 45%...   &gt;and hasn't show he can elevate his team in the playoffs like prime Dwight - yet.  I’m sure Dwight was elevating his team a ton with his 1.2 assists per game.  Embiid averages 2.9 apg in the playoffs btw, over twice as much.  &gt;He had Butler (the guy who took the Lakers to 6 games in the Finals) &amp; Simmons healthy one year and the furthest he got was the 2nd round, and that team was better than any Orlando team Dwight played with.  Yes, and they literally took the eventual champions to 7 games (which took a historical performance and a game winner by Kawhi for the Raptors to win).  &gt;Lol, disprove what I actually said then.  Gladly.   You said   &gt;Even if he didn't have Ben, getting swept by two 20 year olds and an allstar who's never won a playoff series before is laughable.  Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were 22 and 23 years old, respectively, in that series, not “20 years old.”"
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have already won 5 playoff series in 3 years. None of the players/teams you mentioned have won any. That's why the only teams I said can rival us are the Nuggets who have won 3 and the Sixers who have won 2. Forgive me if I don't take teams seriously who haven't accomplished anything.   RemindMe! 2 years  Let's have a discussion on the state of the Celtics then.
"&gt;  Boston, Miami and Denver have been three of the most banged up teams in the league but only the first two get acknowledged because they are big market.  But again no... As I said:  &gt;Even then, we got plenty of comments talking about how Boston was disappointing, it's only now we're out of the woods the media is willing to acknowledge most of those injuries were even a factor.  &gt;Hell, about 2 weeks ago DWade was on national television saying the reason we were losing was because Tatum and Brown needed to 'learn how to win', nevermind those two have been historic in their ability to win at a young age.  Plus we had about 1-2 months of ""who is more to blame, Danny Ainge or Brad Stevens?""  You're comparing Boston's media reception as they're coming out injuries to Jamal's media reception while he was still dealing with injuries.  The complaints you think we weren't getting, we were getting. Go to ESPN's youtube account and scroll back, you'll see plenty of examples.    * [Danny Ainge is not blaming Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for the Celtics' 'major funk' | KJZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VPgwKQ-2e8)  * [This is rock bottom for the Boston Celtics - Kendrick Perkins | KJZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE3Gj60BPBw)  * [Brad Stevens is in trouble - Stephen A. thinks the Celtics head coach is on the hot seat |First Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JYx7OuTHWI)  * [The Celtics are walking over Brad Stevens - Kendrick Perkins | First Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-CBhYWQCqo)  The national media doesn't give anyone credit for being banged up until those guys start playing better and then the credit is applied retrospectively. It's not about Denver being a smaller market than Boston, because our team has gone through the same scrutiny."
"&gt; If you keep thinking your window is later you’re gonna reach a point where Tatum and browns deals are gonna be up and it’s not a lock the resign.   Our window isn't now because Tatum and Brown aren't good enough as players yet.   All you dumb Nets and Lakers fans who have an agenda against the Celtics like to create this faux state of urgency for the Celtics, when, if you actually fucking watched a Celtics game, you'd know that both players have a LONG way to go as players if they want to compete for a championship if they are the best players on the team. Neither of them know how to make anybody on their team better.   &gt; People aren’t clowning you for not trading for jrue they’re clowning you guys for having the best draft capital haul in history and not making a title contender with it  The 2018-19 Celtics had a starting 5 of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and a bench of Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes.   That was the best 9-man rotation anybody in the NBA had that year. Vegas had us as favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference.   Not Danny Ainge's fault that Gordon Hayward was a shell of himself after he broke his fucking leg and couldn't be the 2nd best player on the team like he was supposed to be."
Jayson tatum
LeBron is the only basketball player I've seen be not be terrible at acting. I'm looking at you Jayson Tatum.
Wait what? This sub told me Jayson Tatum wasn’t clutch though
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Russell Westbrook are the only players to ever average 30/7/7 lol  Jayson Tatum is obviously not averaging that"
"All good, they’ll get Beal with that package when he comes on the market (maybe the Wizards can throw in a first). He’s friends with Jayson Tatum you know"
Jayson Tatum is... a carrot 🥕
"Rob looks elite, Pritchard is solid, and the league is about to recognize Romeo now that he is back. I actually like our young guys a lot. Those ""young assets"" you refer to became Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. What could they have traded them away for that would be better than ending up with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown?"
"First of all just lol. Got Lakers fans are ridiculous. I’m not gonna hold my players to the same standards as the literal GOAT/Second best player of all time.  Secondly, never called them a superstar...no one does. They are stars, all stars, but superstars are like the top 7 or so players.  I can’t get over the fact you just said we should hold Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to the same playmaking standard as LeBron freaking James lol what"
"Hey, come on now. We parted with Markelle Fultz to take Jayson Tatum off of your hands, remember?"
His name: Jayson Tatum
"&gt; Jayson Tatum  To me, he's 23 years old."
"They all expire at the same time, there's no guarantee what he would have done. Maybe KD joins JH in Boston with Jayson Tatum? That would be the best wing combination the league has seen in a long time."
My mom saw Jayson Tatum in a subway commercial and said “wait isn’t that the actor you like”   Must be cool to talk sports w your moms
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
"*Jayson Tatum, when not in COVID protocol, has declined pretty steeply as a pick-and-roll and isolation scorer, and he's not nearly as efficient a jump shooter, particularly off the dribble, as he was last season.*  Feels like they’re saying he’s always in Covid protocol like how some players are injury prone. Horribly written sentence either way"
"I hadn’t thought about it until reading your comment but that distinction for him is gonna be so weird in the future. Power forwards now are basically just swing men, the greatest power forward ever could end up being a player physically/skill set like Jayson Tatum. The other 4 positions are essentially the same, but power forward has evolved so much over the years."
"""Correction, this was not Jayson Tatum, but in fact Meyeres Leonard"""
Name Miller's most famous game then.  Yeah his playoff career that includes 8 first round exits really wowed people. People were really amazed by his 20/3/2/1/0 playoff averages. Jayson Tatum averages 20/7/3/1/1 for his career. Should we induct Tatum into the Hall now too?
"Jayson Tatum, he and Lavine have the most aesthetic games in the league."
Jayson Tatum.
"Jaylen is reportedly 6'6.5"" and 7'0 wingspan. You really think 1.5 inches means Jaylen can not be better than Jayson long term lol? For the record I'd take Tatum but it sure as hell isn't because he has a size advantage."
Jayson Tatum
"&gt;Hol up. First of all, Jayson Tatum's appeal has been what he's done offensively AND defensively- unlike lavine and booker, he's an all nba level defender.  Yeah and my post said :  Jayson Tatum is such an **overrated scorer** and  Lavine and Booker are a clear step above him **as scorers**"
"Jayson Tatum is such an overrated scorer, his efficiency (55% TS) is nowhere near Booker (60% TS) and Lavine (65% TS).  Lavine and Booker are a clear step above him as scorers"
"Jayson Tatum: ""Shoot, imma do it too"""
Jayson Tatum will be the 2021/22 KIA MVP
"No they’re not equivalent. That was literally my entire point lol. However, who you’re playing with doesn’t change how impactful/ dominant tou are. Durant was already a top 2 or 3 player. Him winning in GS didn’t do anything to change that.   Penny obviously wasn’t enough to put them over the top. Neither was Nick Van Excel. Kobe was. Why? Because Kobe by 2001 at the latest was the 1st or 2nd best guard in the league, Penny never got to that status.   14 points when the team is scoring 80 a game is not the slight you think it is. Jackson and Parker did enough as secondary scorers throughout the playoffs to not be considered scrubs. Bowen, Jackson, Robinson, and Malik Rose were all great defensive players (which again was why the Spurs won). I’m not saying Duncan didn’t carry. I’m saying the team was not a team of scrubs. Jackson was an integral piece of  the Pacers team that was primed to face the Spurs in the Finals the year after. Parker became their second best player going forward and his numbers never were significantly better, so I guess he was a scrub his whole career. What you’re doing is the equivalent of going back in 15 years and saying Jayson Tatum was a scrub in 2018 &amp; 19 based on his stats.   Duncan also lost to the Lakers when it was Kobe and Pau. Tony and Manu were their fully realized selves by 2008, so what is the excuse?  What efficiency are you talking about if not scoring efficiency? If you’re making your argument based on a center rebounding better than a guard then we’re having different conversations. The only time Duncan’s teams were better than Kobe’s were the years he was playing with Smush and Kwame and the year the Lakers were dysfunctional beyond measure. Other than that, even on even terms the Spurs got smoked."
"thought the nba paint jayson tatum was jayson tater, but jayson potatum is great LMAO"
"Kemba Walker never really adjusted to that role as a clear supporting option behind Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for Boston because he thrives as “the guy” who is most dominant with the ball in his hands, which is what his situation in NY can offer him, especially in pick and pop with Julius Randle"

Brilliant points against Jayson Tatum and the Celtics bench !
Tyler Herro &gt; Jayson Tatum
"Sorry, we had expectations for a rookie Jayson Tatum and second year Jaylen Brown 4 years ago?   Fact is, these guys have far exceeded any reasonable expectations for players at this stage of their careers, but because they’ve had a couple of outstanding post seasons we give them unrealistic expectations overall."
"**Some modern ones:**  * Jerry West convincing the Warriors NOT to trade Klay Thompson for Kevin Love.  He really didn't like Love's lack of defense * Hornets letting Kemba walk instead of offering him a max contract, not trading for Westbrook, and drafting Lamelo might prove to be a genius move * The Clippers trading Blake Griffin super early into his contract * Trading the #1 pick and presumptive first overall pick Markelle Fultz for the 3rd pick and Jayson Tatum"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
The process could’ve had Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum paired with Embiid but instead they got Simmons and Fultz lol. But if Embiid as a consolation prize helps you sleep then so be it.
"Yeah he's arguably a top 15 player in the league, he's definitely a very good player  It's just that #2 or #3 is a bit high  It's like saying that Jayson Tatum is better than Steph Curry"
"also I've heard it said many times before but it can't be reiterated enough. We get these players like Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc who become All Star/All NBA guys a few years into their careers and we forget that most guys take years to develop."
That kid? Jayson Tatum
"Semi Ojelye.  First of all, understand something. When you're cutting first round picks, if you are a quality team in playoff contention, it really doesn't mean that much, that's number one.   Number two and more importantly, Semi Ojelye is gone! Boston should be celebrating. Throw a parade already whether you win a championship or not. This man was a bonafide scrub! He can't play! No disrespect whatsoever, but I'm sorry to call, tell everybody the truth, the man cannot play the game of basketball. He has small hands, he can't catch the ball, he has bad feet, he can't really move even though he's mobile, doesn't really know what he's doing, doesn't have a post move that he or he puts to memory that he can do two times in a row. He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn't have the heart, the passion or anything that comes with it, and you're asking me whether they gave up too much? Please. The Boston Celtics knew exactly what they were doing, they should be celebrating right now, and Jayson Tatum should not be saying a word!"
"Who is the player everyone knows that everyone agrees is overrated, by the way? Like who are you supposed to say to get upvotes here? Pascal Siakam? Tyler Herro? Ben Simmons? Devin Booker? Domantas Sabonis? Jayson Tatum?"

Its time for people to start talking about Jayson Tatum over Damian Lillard..
"Yea I would love to see how much higher (or how close) Dame is compared to the other guys Ben considered/mentioned for the 10th spot on the ""Factoring in Health"" list (Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, &amp; Jayson Tatum)"
"It seems like there’s a pretty consensus top 11 before we get to PG, Tatum, KAT, CP3, Gobert, Trae, Kyrie, Butler, Lavine, Booker, Mitchell, Zion etc. AD had a rough 2021, so I guess I’m not as surprised he isn’t on here, and I bet he would be 11th,   On another note, wild that I just listed 12 other guys that either played like a top 10 player last season at times (like CP3) or if you told me in 10 months “damn I can’t believe Jayson Tatum/Trae/Lavine/KAT is a top 5 player in the league” I would say “huh, alright yeah that sounds reasonable"
"It's more just that it's an old list that hasn't been updated.   It's all the All-Star wings from a couple of years ago when people were down on Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum because they weren't scoring 20ppg as Sophomores.    It's less of a conspiracy and more just a general guideline. Even with the additions of newer all-stars you'd see RJ is still ahead of schedule.   &gt;I don't see why you can take out LeBron and KD among others but leave in guys like Jimmy or Kawhi who are just as big of an outlier at the other end.  Because we're not talking about top 15 all time scorers. We're talking about ""average All-Star wings"", which is a term you specifically pointed out.   I could include Michael Jordan and Larry Bird in the list and call them average all-stars if it would make you feel better?  No, Jimmy Butler is not as much of an outlier as LeBron James."
"It's kind of weird, since I wouldn't really consider any of those 4 to be at the same level or good comparisons between each other.  I think with Luka Jayson Tatum would be better example of being a young player in the similar level.  With Trae it would be someone like Bam Adebayo, although it's very possible if not even likely that Trae will take the jump this year to a higher level if he can limit his defensive liabilities a bit. (or his team uses him in different kind of defensive role). In his current state it was kind of difficult to find other players of similar position and size to him. I'd say he's somewhere comfortably higher than Kemba, but at least based on last year a step or two behind Holiday. Good comparison of his ideal future would be someone like Lillard who is also relatively (although not quite as) short point guard who's negative on defense but major positive on offense which is basically Trae's profile right now.  For Ja Morant maybe someone like Brandon Ingram could be more fitting comparison of someone that provides similar value overall.  Then for Herro I think Kuzma example already given in this thread was great. Also names that float around him that  I'd bring up are Markelle Fultz or Svi Mykhailuk."
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31254061/boston-celtics-jayson-tatum-fighting-covid-19-effects-close-100-percent-performance-picks-up   3 months after Tatum was still using an inhaler.
"I was responding to another thread and found an interesting comparison:   RJ Barrett - 6'6 SF  Jayson Tatum - 6'8 SF   **Age 19 rookie season:**  Player| Pts| Rbd| Ast| eFG| mpg ---|---|----|----|----|---- Tatum | 14| 5| 2| 54%| 31 RJ | 14| 5| 3| 45%| 30  **Age 20 sophomore season:**  Player| Pts| Rbd| Ast| eFG| mpg ---|---|----|----|----|---- Tatum | 16| 6| 2| 50%| 31 RJ | 18| 6| 3| 50%| 35  As you can see, they put up very similar numbers, as wings that can score from multiple levels with the ball in their hands. Now, Tatum's third season, he made the leap to 26/7/4 on 53% eFG% in 36mpg. The third year is when lots of young guys make the leap. We may in for a big jump from RJ Barrett."
RJ becoming Jayson Tatum doesn’t make any sense to me at all. Neither does OG becoming Klay.
"[Lucille Bluth voice]: I mean it's one Jayson Tatum, how much could it cost? $20?"
"RJ has more potential as a three level scorer, and offense raises your ceiling more than defense. OG is great but he looks like he'll be an elite 3&amp;D player. If OG could become a Klay Thompson type, RJ could become a Jayson Tatum type. However, OG is closer than RJ is to reaching his potential so far.   This year I'd take OG for now based on what we've seen in the past, but RJ could very easily make that leap and be more valuable this year, and I see him as having more potential going forward"
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
"&gt; Boston's offense wasn't quite the ""your turn, my turn"" blah-fest critics made it out to be last season. The Celtics ranked ninth in isolations and in the middle in passes. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are scorers first, but both advanced as playmakers -- especially Tatum. How much more they grow that part of their games will determine how far they lead Boston.  Really glad to see Lowe push back on this narrative."
Somewhere around 11-16.   I think he sits on the outside of the top 10 and would be in the Paul George-Jayson Tatum-Jimmy Butler-Brad Beal range.
"Jayson Tatum needed an inhaler after ""recovering"" from COVID, having never needed one at any point in his life prior to that.  Eduardo Rodriguez lost 20 pounds and couldn't pitch for a year.  Those guys are professional athletes in their 20s!"
"Of course, you have Stephen Curry, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard. Above them is future HOFer Trey Murphy III."

"It’s just that people are used to Tatum being incredible now so it’s talked about less. He had 2 50 point games in the playoffs and took a game off of the fully healthy Nets without 3 starters (Jaylen didn’t play in the playoffs).   I think it’s that mixed with Jaylen’s massive leap. When Jayson was injured/couldn’t play due to COVID Jaylen averaged over 30 points per game and is honestly one of the clear best scorers in the league along with Jayson.   Because of that when the Celtics were talked about  by the media it was “Is Jaylen as good as Jayson?” or “Which Jay is the number one guy?”  The media in general just didn’t talk about how good Jayson himself was last season sans the COVID month.   Hell, they barely talked about how he scored 60 points in a game tying Larry Bird’s record to complete the 3rd largest halftime comeback in NBA history (37 points behind)."

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

Jayson Tatum underrated  Jaylen Brown overrated
All they need is that final piece to push them over the top.   How about Ben Simmons for Jayson Tatum and Dennis Shroder?
"Duncan is the example used because no other team in recent memory has been able to pick #1 overall to a win-now team since that Spurs team, besides the Sixers trading up for Fultz (pause for PTSD flashbacks).   But let's move away from strictly \#1 overall so that we have a larger sample size. I'm pretty sure Jayson Tatum was picked #3 to a 53 win Celtics team the first year Ben played. Yet somehow, despite having to contribute right away due to Gordon Hayward breaking his ankle in the first game, Tatum has developed significantly more than Simmons has.   2003, Dwyane Wade went \#5 to Miami. He and Lamar Odom led the team to a 42-40 record his rookie year, and in his sophomore year they traded Odom and role players for Shaq and won 59 games."
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown like 🤔
Jayson Tatum is playing him the world's saddest song on the world's tiniest violin.
Wait but what about Jayson Tatum who was drafted to a #1 seed that just added Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward?? He seems to have developed just fine
So if this is true why arent jayson tatum and donavon mitchell terrible? Or Kyrie back in cleveland days? So dumb
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
"&gt;Ime Udoka on Jayson Tatum in the post: ""We like him to play big boy ball down there.""  Ime Udoka, the head coach and de facto strategist of the Boston Celtics of the NBA, shared insight on his plans for how he will utilize his young superstar, Jayson Tatum (of the Boston Celtics of the NBA). He mentioned that he likes it when Jayson plays ""big boy ball,"" or basketball in the style of the big players that traditionally play the power forward and center roles. The term ""big boy"" in reference refers to the size of players that are normally playing those roles - the roles are filled by large men that rely on strength and size to score points and secure rebounds for additional possessions. Ime specifically wants Jayson to emulate that style of play in the post (""down there""), where centers and power forwards typically play due to their style of play being more dependent on strength than finesse."
Are you calling Wiggins a young star?????  Young star Jayson Tatum really struggled last season with his bout of covid. He played but he wasn't right.

"LeBron’s teammates showed up for the Raptors, if they’d played like that the whole time it wouldn’t have been a carry job at all despite the fact it was his best series individually. The Celtics had Kyrie most of the season, but tell me more about how a team whose best player was either Al Horford or a rookie Jayson Tatum was anything resembling a competitive conference finals opponent in a year that isn’t absolute ass. Pacers were decent. A lot of teams are decent. Could surround LeBron with the 14 worst players in the league and he should still be beating them, because he’s LeBron and “decent” teams don’t have any business in the Finals either. Which is my whole point."

"More assets not listed here like the rights to LA's 1st, a lotto pick which became Mikal Bridges, which he acquired for MCW lmao.   Another thing worth mentioning is that one of those picks swaps = getting pick #3 in 2017(which became Jayson Tatum of course). Given that it was a swap, the management that replaced him did nothing to get that pick. Pick #3 in 2017 should effectively be specified and added to this.   Not an ""asset"" necessarily, but it's also important to note that Hinkie had the Sixers in position to have multiple max FA slots as well."
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He’d take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons’ lack of shooting does for Embiid’s spacing, we don’t spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid’s presence takes away all of Ben’s post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he’ll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he’s far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it’s so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid’s presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers’ insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons’ violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn’t shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won’t develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he’s actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn’t an ideal usage of a team’s time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here’s the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it’s only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben’s ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."
Jayson Tatum had a rough time with covid too. I’m unsure if he still needs it now but he needed a breathalyzer for a time after getting it and he’s never needed one before.
Have people already forgotten about Jayson Tatum needing an inhaler after having COVID &amp; previously never having to use one?? That was one of the first major red flags to me with athletes and COVID
"Its not about their choice, it is because they are in an influential position as well known stars whose every word gets reported around the country and world.   Who is to stop the next town vax denier from using their words as fuel for spreading more mis-information?  I'm a lebron fan, but imagine if he was unvaxed and a lot of the african american population decided, if Lebron doesn't feel like its worth taking the shot, why should we?  Or Jayson Tatum, or Luka Doncic. They are visible stars and should be responsible."
"Ball Handler: Doncic   ($5) 1 or 1A best combination of youth and skill in the list. Age 22. This lineup would give him the ability to run any set he wants. The rest of the team would allow his defense weaknesses to be covered up (assuming the $1 guy buys in). If you're into traditional positions, he'd be PG.  Wings   Gary Trent Jr ($1)  Excellent shooter who would probably get a lot of room to shoot thanks to Tatum and Doncic. Has defensive skills - if he can be convinced to channel them.  On this team, likely to feast on all the open shots that Doncic/Tatum/Ayton will be providing.  Age 22. Traditional position: SG  Mikal Bridges ($2) All around glue guy.  Age 25.  Does multiple things well, could serve as clean-up both offensively and defensively, setting screens or providing help. Traditional set position: SF  Jayson Tatum ($4) 1 or 1a best combination of youth or skill. The best all-around player in this lineup. Age 23. Traditional position: PF  Big  Deandre Ayton ($3) Best young big on this list. Age 23. Can play in and out, switchable all around. Traditional position: C  Defensively switchable enough to help protect Doncic, offensively could pull off a lot of multiple sets with Doncic and Tatum capable of handling the ball as faciliator. Imagine the pick and roll in different combinations with these guys.  And probably most significantly, the youth of this team gives it both a high floor and a really high ceiling."
"Lonzo Ball $1  Jayson Tatum $4  Giannis $5  Myles Turner $2  DeAndre Ayton $3  Everyone is a competent defender especially in the frontcourt. All of them are in their prime or entering it, 3pt shooting might be iffy but the spacing should be alright. Giannis would be running point and Lonzo would be a spot up shooter and making plays on the break like Mavs Jason Kidd."
Lamelo Ball  Gary Trent Jr.  Anthony Edwards  Jayson Tatum  Nikola Jokic
"Watching him in the playoffs, I came away thinking he was kind of inconsistent. If he could work on that and improving his scoring in general and/or work on his defense, then he could be top 15.   I have him at 20  11.Damien Lillard   12.Jayson Tatum  13.Donovan Mitchell   14.Kyrie Irving   15.Chris Paul   16.Jimmy Butler  17.Trae Young  18.Paul George   19.Zach Lavine   20.Devin Booker  21.Bradley Beal   And you could even make the case that Beal is better than him. I don’t think he’s better than anyone in the top 15 personally. Even if you think he’s better than Chris Paul, there are still the players from 16-19 that have a case to be over him."
"Besides even if you *are* NBA athlete peak shape, COVID can fuck you up. Jayson Tatum needing an inhaler for the rest of the season, Eduardo Rodriguez of the Red Sox missing 2020 with serious heart issues caused by COVID, etc.  We focus too much on the death rate and not the long COVID/long term life altering effects rate which is something like 1 in 3. That's not odds I'd like to mess with."
I just wanted to point out that Westbrook has a higher TS% and eFG% than Jayson Tatum this season.
[jayson tatum tonight](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCFtz3XWUAYd1X2.jpg)
"I guess Paul George, Donavon Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Bradly Beal, and  Anthony Edwards aren't very good this year either since they all shoot 20 or more shots a game and all but Paul George have a worse shooting percentage than Luka even though Luka averages more points than all of them except Paul George by two points. That dang one bucket keeps stopping Luka from not being good."
Tbf Jayson Tatum is just like Kobe
"Man people throw that comparison too early 😂first it was devin booker, then Jayson tatum, who's next?"
Curry would love to play in the east and face rookie Jayson Tatum as the best player in a playoff run.
Jayson Tatum is pretty slow dude. Great player but without the elite shooting he has he'd struggle getting to the rim

"Jayson ""Monkey's Paw"" Tatum"
"If Jayson Tatum had the offball movement of Curry he could legit become the best player in the league one day. But instead he just stands there ballwatching with absolutely no effort to get open or disrupt the defense and becomes so easy to shut down, it's so frustrating to watch. Curry's conditioning is insane, he's constantly moving out there whenever he doesn't have the ball in his hands and his gravity is the cornerstone of the Warriors' motion offense. At this point he is genuinely more impressive to watch than LeBron, it is a true privilege to be able to see him play."
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Ya, I think for the people who didn't get caught up in the hype he's developed into the exact player he was advertised to be. Not a first-option scorer but a floor raiser who can contribute in every way. He's no Jayson Tatum but for teams with another primary scorer, Lonzo provides more value than a Tatum-type player can."
"Calling Jayson Tatum Michael Redd is really stupid lmao. Tatum's played in over 3x as many career playoff games and he's only 23. He's won multiple series with one or two max contract players sidelined. In Redd's whole career he scored over 50 twice. Tatum did that 5 times last season all in the span of two months, twice in the playoffs. He's also literally still only 23 years old."
"Well then he’s gonna have the same problems elsewhere because everyone does that. Marcus Smart just called out Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown like last week. Anthony Edwards called out Kat and Dlo. That’s what Teammates do when asked a specific question. None of them sulked and ghosted the team like Ben though, instead they listened and got better."
Sometimes you’re Jayson Tatum and other nights your Jayson Tatum.
Does anyone else call them Tatum Chips or Jayson Taters or is that just my friend group?
Jayson Tatum is 23.
"Zach has been averaging 25-5-5 for years now, all that while shooting 40+% from 3 and having insane athleticism, people just glossed over him because he played on some of the worst teams in the league.  For example, there's no statistical argument that supports Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell being substantially better than LaVine in the last three seasons, yet 99% of this sub would've said so before this year just because they played in better teams."
I trust Josh Richardson to make an iso midrange jumpshot significantly more than Jayson Tatum this year so far
We really are a Jayson Tatum short of being a real top 6 team in the East. Everyone else was varying degrees of good

"I don't know people are freaking out about the Celtics right now. Jayson Tatum is only 19, they have plenty of time"
"Interesting fact,  this interview made me realize if LaMelo shaved his head he would look exactly like Jayson Tatum"
Jayson Tatum is the worst embodiment of that currently. Jacking up shots without making much
"Jalen Brown and Jayson Tatum for John Wall, who says no?"
"If we were to trade away a Jay, I’d trade Jayson.  The consensus seems to be that Tatum is the better player, but I don’t know that that’s true.  Brown definitely ‘gets it’ in a way that Tatum just doesn’t, and I frankly think he’s just as good on the court as Tatum."
The Jayson Tatum special
Kd: 29.4 points a game at 24.9 possessions a game (1.179 ppp)   Jayson Tatum: 23.5 points a game with 27.2 possessions a game (.864 ppp)  Min 100 poss kd is 13 and Tatum is 145 out of 173 players
Jayson Tatum &amp; Beal knew Nelly since they were kids
"Jayson Tatum couldn't post up 6'1 Darius Garland yesterday man, I feel your pain"
Did MJ lock up Jayson Tatum in the 4th in his 13th career game?
"I mean he is absolutely slumping hard right now, but as a Celtics fan, I remain extremely excited about the prospect of watching Jayson Tatum play for the next decade.   He’ll figure it out."
"jayson ""the settler"" tatum"
"Celtics fans, what has happened to Jayson Tatum? I swear the last I watched him, he looked better than what he currently is."
Why not? Didn’t stop Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum sounds like he’d be real comfortable on a team that never actually wins

"No flair Celtics fan here to agree wholeheartedly with what you're saying.  Shot selection is just hilariously bad most of the time.  He got away with it for a very long time, but now that those bad shots aren't routinely going in, he looks like a foolish basketball player who doesn't understand the game.  I love Jayson Tatum, but I'm concerned he's never going to figure out that getting 21 on 22 shots isn't winning basketball."
What a homer take lol  Jayson Tatum is not a fucking playmaker
As a Spurs fan I can confirm the Celtics play better when they're behind... Especially Jayson Tatum. *shudders*
what jayson Tatum iso plays does to a mfer
"Tatum is not only shooting poorly, he's taking bad shots. Shots that he took in his sophomore, I'm Jayson ""Kobe Bryant"" Tatum, year. Regressed is the perfect wird."
That’s Jason Tatum indeed because lord knows where Jayson Tatum is right now
"He adopted Jayson Tatum in the 4th, what a fucking beast he is."

Remember when people thought Jayson Tatum was good? Like... Really good? Remember when people voted him for MVP? That was hilarious.
Nice how he gets a better whistle than Jayson Tatum. Must be all the squating nurse does.
Jayson Tatum.
"Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum do everything that Beal does, we need a third star who complements them, Beal would be a bad fit."
"It's not like there's much highlights to be posted from the Celtics, other than the ongoing team dysfunction or Jayson Tatum shooting 10 of 35 or something."
Jayson Tatum
And then Jayson Tatum somehow gets younger every time you say his name.
"Who wins a pre-30 vs post-30 game in the NBA?   **Pre:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Post:** Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic."
"Harden is in a tier of his own putting up video games numbers in 2017-19 stretch   But fucking Jayson Tatum got 4 50 pieces? Lol when did those even happen, aside from 1 against the Nets?"
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
I would trade Jayson Tatum before Jaylen Brown.
This is a mistake Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum will lead this team to a title! ............ Who am I kidding 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Jayson Tatum did the same last season.   It's important information, because for better or (mostly) worse a whole lot of people in this country tend to take their lead from the rich and famous."
Hopefully the effects aren't everlasting like it was for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
I don't feel like this has been true for at least a year.  People have recognised the growth in Jaylen's game and the fact that Jayson hasn't taken the leap people thought he would yet.  Most people who actually pay attention have them pretty close while acknowledging that Tatum has a higher ceiling.
"Jayson Tatum: 26.4/7.4/4.3 on 57.6 TS%, shooting 38.6% from 3 on mostly unassisted 3s. 6.5 WS, 3.7 BPM, 3.3 VORP. Better help defender. Much better playoff performances.  Jaylen Brown: 24.7/6.0/3.4 on 58.6 TS%, shooting 39.7% from on mostly assisted 3s. 4.8 WS, 2.5 BPM, 2.3 VORP. Better on ball defender.  Brown is great, but Tatum is inarguably better. A small sample size so far this year doesn't change that. Both are still franchise guys though."
"We'll be happy to take Jaylon Brown or Jayson Tatum plus Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons and Grant Riller.   Win-Win all around!  If we get either of the Jays straight up for Ben, I won't need Christmas for the rest of the decade!  Please Boston, let us fleece you for the Fultz/Tatum fleecing you did to us."
"If you think about it just a little bit deeper than the memes, this trade actually makes sense. The Celtics have been very disappointing this season, and their track record overall since Jaylen and Jayson became the two main guys has been a little bit of a let down. Imo the two guys overlap too much to the point where it doesn’t make sense to have them on the same team. Trading for Simmons, an all world defender, balances out the offense (he doesn’t demand a lot of shots) and reduces the playmaking pressure on Tatum. Plus, it maybe helps the locker room culture in Boston to shake things up (I know, it’s Ben, but it’s gotta be better than staying in the same place, right?). Obviously, makes sense for the Sixers in that they get a solid wing scorer who’s also a good perimeter defender. Sixers defense has been missing Simmons badly, replacing him with Brown at least helps."
"Boston fans were talking shit about Jayson fucking Tatum because of his bad start, booed the team multiple times at home alread and spent all if last season making fun of Grant Williams. Simmons would get bullied out of the league if he went to Boston and played like he did in the playoffs."
"&gt;what's going on with that guy who quit on your team and now does the bare minimum  wait, are we still talking about Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum?"
"Yeah the fit of Tatum/Brown/Simmons is nice.     All very big, switchable and athletic players.   We're struggling with 1st-4th quarter point generation for our role players - [Ben happens to be one of the best in the league at generating 3PA for his teammates.](https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/status/1231375821820088321?s=20)   Ben struggles with late-game offensive responsibilities - [We have Jayson Tatum.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkZhh9eY_Fk)  In Laker terms, Philly needed him to be the Kobe to their Shaq but in Boston he could be more like our Lamar Odom.  He doesn't have to be the leading man, he just has to keep things chugging along so our guys aren't exhausted with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter."
For Ben Simmons Sake Goin From Philly To Boston ain’t No Better Fan Wise lol. Nd imagine sixers did all this extra shit just to still end up with Jayson Tatum😭
"2017-2018 Celtics against Warriors in the finals would have been awesome. If we faced them with Kyrie and Hayward I legitimately think we could have taken them to 7, we had been matching up really well with them that season and their 73 win season.   But if we faced them injured, would still be insane to see a team with Al Horford as the best player make the finals and see rookie Jayson Tatum and sophomore Jaylen Brown going up against Golden State."
I also recall Laker fans hyping up Kyle Kuzma as a better pick than Jayson Tatum in their rookie seasons lmao
a lot of teams in the east don't have Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown. we're chill.
Just like Jayson Tatum is poverty Kobe chucking up shots like mad this year for a 4-6 team.
Chris Duarte is the opposite of Jayson Tatum
"#[Brooks] Kevin Durant on Jayson Tatum: ""How old is he? 19? 20? Sheesh."" Durant said Tatum’s IQ and enthusiasm for the game is “rare” for a rookie. Durant added Tatum is only going to get better."
"I can't explain because I have no idea what these numbers are. Here are their  plus/minus stats as tracked by Nba.com.  * Lavine +0.6 * Derozan +7.6 * Lonzo +6.6 * Vucevic +2.4 * Caruso +1.9  Basketballreference.com has their own version  * Lavine +1.9 * Derozan +3.9 * Lonzo -0.5 * Vucevic -0.8 * Caruso -0.6  But neither source has Lavine as a massive negative influence.  Jayson Tatum also has a similar +/- on the Celtics, lowest of all the starters even though he's the lynchpin of that team."
Jayson tatum
"Looking forward to a 2031 Lakers roster of Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bronny James, Jayson Tatum, and Dwight Howard going 31-51."
"Look up Jayson Tatum, Von Miller, Freddie Freeman, Paulo Dybala."
"Why dont you ask Jayson Tatum, genius"

"seven completed seasons  * missed playoffs first season, made it in six straight since * knocked out of playoffs first round twice, made it to second round four straight since * made conference finals three times, lost to greatest player of this generation twice * coached a team of rookies to the finals * helped coach jayson tatum from a raw player with awful shot selection to a team leader, 2 x all star, 1 x all nba, high level defensive and offensive player * helped coach jaylen brown from a player most people cringed to watch into one a legitimate all star with solid handles, leadership, and scoring ability * has done all of this with one(?) season of a fully healthy team  i think finishing top 4 three times in a thirty team league is pretty solid accomplishment considering he's had no superstars to work with"
"He's been great for awhile now, this was just an off night. Still think he's in the Jayson Tatum or Devin Booker range of value"
"Oh no, we lost to the thunder while missing our best player Jayson Tatum, a massively important Kemba Walker, and the 3rd most impactful player behind only Jokic and Embiid Timelord."
If we are being honest ainge has been a bad drafter outside of jaylen brown and jayson Tatum   He should have either traded some of those picks for veterans who can shoot or used those picks for guys with maybe lower upside but guys who could be solid rotation guys.
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
"Jayson Tatum, Russell Westbrook, D Lillard, KD have all missed open and clutch layups. That’s off the top of my head. It happens"
"C's fall to 7 and lose their way out of the playoffs with Jayson ""the settler"" Tatum doing his best kobe impression"
Jayson Tatum probably didn't even know how to ride a bike when Dwight got drafted
"&gt;**They could have** a starting line up with Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, and Kevin Durant   But they wouldn't"
"I hate to entertain this post but you forgot Colin Sexton. He was selected with one of Nets picks. To go back even further, we traded the 6th pick for Gerald Wallace. 6th pick turned into Damian Lillard.   So really its:  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, and Colin Sexton"
"When facing the hoop: Kyrie Irving or Steph Curry  When back to the hoop: Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan"
"Yes he is lol.   He’s been very good on the defensive end for us.  everytime he was matched up against devin booker, jayson Tatum &amp; Trae young they either weren’t able to score or he gave them a very difficult time."
"Do you still need to feed your son, Duece, Jayson Tatum from the Boston Celtics? LETS GOOOOOO"

Yo that shit was hilarious - Jayson Tatum
"No. Comparing players in different eras is already dumb enough, but by your logic, we’d see people arguing (in an extreme case) say Jayson Tatum is a better player than like Julius Erving because he wasn’t doing crossover and throwing one-hand dimes all over the court.  I think everyone’s point is relative to where they were positioned in the nba for each’s respective era, Charles Barkley has shown much more as a playmaker comparative to Zion in his era. I tend to agree, especially since we’re comparing ~70 games to a 15+ year career. We can pump the brakes a little bit without getting upset lol"
"I hope for him to be another KD type scoring beast. Realistically, if he developes into a Jayson Tatum or even Donovan Mitchell type player, that would be all you want from him and a bag of chips"
"Of course, I thought that goes without saying. - Jayson Tatum"
"Hi Jayson! Were you upset that they picked your twin brother, Channing Tatum, for the role of Magic Mike over you? Thanks!"
"Hey Jayson Tatum, do you guard Kemba during practices? How tough is he to guard?"
"Hi Jayson Tatum, how have you handled with COVID this season? How do you try to maintain continuity with the Celtics while being out?"
It is not really him!!!! He did not sign Jayson Tatum!!!!
"That's exactly it, well said.  -Not Jayson Tatum"
"I have a lot of help with my mom and his mom, they make it easier for all of us so it’s a collective effort. But I don’t really look at it as a balancing thing. Maybe it was at first, because I had a kid 2/3 months after I got drafted so that was all new, just being in the NBA and also being a parent. But now, it’s just what I do. It’s my everyday life. - Jayson Tatum"
"I started at a young age. My dad is like 6’6, and when he was growing up that was extremely tall. But now, 6’6 is like a point guard or a two-guard, and when I was growing up, everybody knew I was probably going to be taller than him, but he didn’t necessarily put me in the post and make me a big man. He showed me guard skills when I was young. So I think whatever size you are, learning guard skills first can go a long way. - Jayson Tatum"
"It was the best feeling ever. I was sitting in the green room at the table, and I’ll never forget when the 3rd pick came up and Adam Silver came out. What they don’t show you is all the cameras before he announced it. He comes out and all the cameras run at me, and I’m like “this is it.” But after about 5 seconds, they left and went to another table, and I looked at my mom looking like the world’s saddest kid. But then they ran back over to my table, and he said my name. It was a surreal feeling.   Ever since I was 3 years old I had dreamed of being in the NBA, and I can’t tell you how many times I dreamed of sitting at that table and hearing my name get called. It’s hard to describe the emotions. - Jayson Tatum"
"Recently, he’s wanted to play basketball more on his hoop. As he’s gotten a little older and since fans have been allowed he’s been coming to the home games, and the last couple weeks, he’s really been trying to get me to play basketball with him, shoot with him and show him how to dribble. I didn’t want to force him, but always thought that he’s going to be around it so much, so if he ever picks the ball up and wants to, obviously I’ll be more than happy to play with him and teach him. And that’s started to happen a lot recently around the house. - Jayson Tatum"
"It’s stagnant right now due to inclement weather here in Boston, but it’s starting to get nicer outside, and I actually got to play for the first time in a while last week. It felt good to get outside and get outdoors. - Jayson Tatum"
"I love watching Steph, Kyrie, Brad Beal and Anthony Davis. And then the guys I came in with like Bam, Donovan and Fox. - Jayson Tatum"
"I had an awesome time during my one year in college. Most of us on the team were from out of state, and so it was kinda like having 14 new siblings. We spent so much time together, from going out to eat and traveling to being each other’s dorms. I still keep in touch with most of those guys today, including two of my closest friends, Amile Jefferson and Harry Giles. I formed some special relationships during that short period of time. - Jayson Tatum"
"Honestly, I didn’t shoot that great in college percentage wise. My first year in the league I shot like 43-44% from three, and over my 4-year career I think I’m at like 40%. I don’t know what happened, but I definitely shoot it better now in the league than I did in college.  - Jayson Tatum"
"We have 10 or 11 games left. You want to win every game as a player, but with how close the seeding is, every game right now is especially important. So we’re trying to finish on a high note, and then trying to be healthy going into the playoffs and feel like the best version of ourselves, individually and as a unit. When the playoffs come, it’s go time. - Jayson Tatum"
"If I could shoot like Steph, that would be pretty nice. - Jayson Tatum"
"I kinda go about a game day like I would any other day. I just try to be as relaxed and calm and normal as I can be. I normally take a little nap before shootaround, but other than that I just like to come in with a clear mind and ready to have fun. That’s when i play my best, when I’m just having fun. - Jayson Tatum"
"Jayson Tatum, who do you think is the funniest player on the Celtics?"
"There’s a lot of restaurants in the North End. Italian, steak houses, any restaurant you go to around there just has that Boston feel. - Jayson Tatum"
"This is a great place to be if you’re a professional athlete. People here love their teams. Every game we have is sold out, and it was like that even before I got here, even if you’re rebuilding. They know basketball, and you can feel that in the atmosphere when we’re playing, if I’m out to eat or even just driving through the city. - Jayson Tatum"
"I’ve had a few convos with KG, and Paul Pierce was around a lot my rookie year. I did a special with him after training camp, and it was great to get the opportunity to talk to a Celtics legend like that my first year. I was just in awe and was all ears. He told me about how when he got drafted, he realized there’s a difference between being with this franchise and others. All the championship banners, all the hall of famers that played before him and before me. There’s a lot of pride but also a lot of responsibility that comes with putting on that jersey, and a lot of expectations with playing in the city of Boston. The fans here expect excellence. - Jayson Tatum"
"In your first year, you’re in a new environment, a new city, in new surroundings. What I tried to do was earn the trust and respect of my coaches and teammates. Listen to everything they had to say. Always be early, be on the first bus. You’re a rookie, so you need to show in training camp and early in the season that you’re willing to do what it takes to get an opportunity. Once you get that opportunity, it’s up to you to decide where to go from there. - Jayson Tatum"
Almost as old as Jayson Tatum
"There are a few. Game 7 my rookie year against Cleveland, Game 3 my rookie year against Philly to go up 3-0, the game I had against Steph Curry last week, Game 7 last year against Toronto to go to the Eastern Conference Finals, and obviously the game I scored 53, my career high. Those would probably be my top 5. - Jayson Tatum"
"In college everyone is relatively the same age. But when I got drafted, I was 19 and had guys on my team like Al Horford who was like 30-32 years old with a wife and kids. It was weird how two people can be at two totally different places in their life but be on the same team. And also just the travel schedule. - Jayson Tatum"
"I always felt like I would be a star, but it just came a lot faster than I expected. Towards the end of my rookie year, around the time when Kyrie went out with injury, we went undefeated on a West Coast road trip and finished the season as the 2nd seed. I obviously had to take on a bigger offensive role, and it was during that period where I felt like even though I’m young and this is my first year, I’m built for this. - Jayson Tatum"
"I think for my own individual matchup, Kawhi and Paul George. Those are two guys I looked up to before I got into the league.  - Jayson Tatum"
"It’s different now. Everything was new to me my first year or two as I was living out my dream. I was a little starstruck, having to almost pinch myself that this is my reality, and getting a chance to compete against these people I grew up idolizing. I think now - I still have that same respect for all the guys that have been doing this for a long time, but I’m also trying to make my own imprint on this game. - Jayson Tatum"
Oh yeah... its gotten better with the curls. Got some positive feedback so for sure top 5. -  Jayson Tatum
"Hi Tatum.   1. Do you find it weird when you get referred to as Tatum instead of Jayson?  2. You and Jaylen Brown are quite the tandem. Given that you get to watch him, both on the court and off the court, what do you admire most in his game? Is there something you see in his game/personality that you wish you had or are trying to emulate?"
Jayson Tatum
Hey Jayson! How does it feel to be the father of future NBA hall-of-famer Deuce Tatum?
"Why aren't all-dressed chips in every store in America?  Even though I want to ask Jayson Tatum 1000 questions, mostly about Daniel Theis, I need more access to America's next favorite chip."
Bruh just google it he’s answered this from like 20 actual reporters my man [here’s a whole article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30912183/boston-celtics-jayson-tatum-says-feeling-effects-covid-19)
Bacon Tatum Subway Subs or Jayson Tatum flavored Ruffles?
"Jayson Tatum, u need to get a cut bro. Where is top 5 TATUM!"
"&gt; I hope they draft a player who turns into a complete stud  Maybe someone like Jayson Tatum? Or what about a guy like Jaylen Brown? Yeah, having either one of them on your team would be great I think."

"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You’re committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of “super stars.” Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there’s not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell’s career.   Basically, I don’t really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he’ll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there’s others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"
"Fair point but comparing the pistons situation to the Celtics situation isn’t really accurate. Pistons doing win now moves when their main option was Andre Drummond was stupid but the Celtics have already shown they are contenders, to take the next step they have to go for it at some point.  Boston still has a somewhat long window but stars these days are dictating where they want to go and if Boston doesn’t improve in the next few years I wouldn’t be shocked if jaylen brown decides he wants to go somewhere else in two years if the Celtics don’t advance far enough. Do the Celtics want to waste another year of brown and Tatum because that’s what they will likely do if they bring this same roster back next year. I am not saying trade jaylen brown or jayson Tatum but get some vets to surround these guys with. If they need to trade a first to get a solid vet they should go for that move"
Lukewarm take but I think part of the reason they were overrated is because people overrated Jayson Tatum. I actually really like Tatum and he's still young but people started treating him like a legitimate top 10 player and he just isn't there yet. He's arguably not even top 15. The Celtics are young and interesting but they still lack a legitimately elite player. Tatum will get there eventually but he just isn't yet.
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That’s 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"
"You have to take context into account.   RJ is having a good year, and Tatum did have a rather underwhelming sophomore season, so that just goes to show, a great year for RJ was a bad year for Jayson. Jayson made a huge leap after year 2. The 2018-19 Celtics were in an ugly situation.   In that ugly year, Tatum averaged 19/6/2 on .597 TS% in the first round against Indiana, so let’s see if RJ is at that level and can do similar this year in the playoffs.   Jaylen Brown’s sophomore year isn’t an accurate comparison. He took 10 shots a game, whereas RJ is taking 15.  Jaylen took just over 15 shots a game last year and averaged 20/6/2 on .583 TS%."
Brandon Ingram and Jayson Tatum been crushin it too.
"&gt;If players could genuinely play significantly better in high pressure moments they’d do it all the time.  The counter-example to that point would be Jayson Tatum. He's known as a clutch player, and the stats back it up. I think he really does play better in high pressure moments, and he could do it all game if he expended the effort."
Even Jayson Tatum thinks the Sixers complain too much
I'll ask Jayson Tatum about his thoughts on JaSean Tate

Probably something similar to Jayson Tatum
"Jayson Tatum is most definitely more than a solid all-star. He’s knocking on the door of top 10. Embiid is a foot in, but Tatum isn’t too far behind him. A few more regular season wins and 3 more PPG doesn’t change any of that.   I can really argue that if Tatum did not get COVID, he would be have an extraordinary season."
Jayson tatum
"Probably because the Celtics won, but the main reason is because Jayson Tatum is nowhere near the MVP debate meanwhile Embiid is at the forefront of it."
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
I saw the Celtics using last season. A couple of days later Frank Bigel said He took it from jayson Tatum and Theisis since rhey used this in their first matchup. I also saw McGee get called for a moving pick trying to do it. Almost unfair if done right. I don’t think it’s new tho. I think you could find Nash and CP doing the same thing years ago.
his real name is jayson tatum jr

"The 2018 cavs basically swapped Kyrie for role players, needed 7 games to get out of the first round, and needed 48 minutes from LeBron in game 7 of the eastern conference finals to beat a heavily injured Celtics team led by 20 year old Jayson Tatum. Yes, they only lost to the super warriors but they were definitively not better than the 2017 Cavs who were literally setting offensive records during the playoffs."
"I feel like this pearl would be wasted on you, but people as successful as Jayson Tatum are the exception, not the rule.   Imagine if Jayson Tatum was of average height.   Boom, career gone."
Jayson Tatum?
You lied to me. You said you were the real Jayson Tatum.🤦🏾‍♂️  You had my trust. Karma is real.
Obi Toppin is also Evil Jayson Tatum lmao
Jayson Tatum against UNC while he was at Duke... I went to UNC and that game I was just so impressed. Both teams were stacked that year and he was clearly a cut above the rest. I had seen a lot of basketball but he was by far the best college player I'd seen since KD.
..iam not even jayson tatum and i don't spend shit on reddit!
"As an honest Jaylen Brown fan I must admit that he deserves to be traded for Norman Powell. If we must, we should throw in a pick as well. Not only that but Jaylen is worthless and his 40 point games are all flukes.

"I haven't seen a lot of talk to that level despite Celtics fans looking at Rob with rose colored glasses on.  And while C's fans are enthusiastic about their young guys, they're no better or worse than any other fanbase on r/nba.  Lakers flairs were adamant that Kuzma was much better than Jayson Tatum.  Sixers fans were still holding out hope that Ben Simmons, who has added nothing to his game offensively in 4 years in the NBA, will magically turn a corner.  Blazer fans are especially precious, they think that Zach Collins is dripping with upside and the answer to their roster flaws despite the fact that he's played 11 games in the last 2 years.  The Celtics fans pound the table for the Jays, but that's because they're both actually really good."
"This year is a weird year.  Like I would have never said Booker, CP3, Paul George, or Trae Young had any shot at this but then AD, Kyrie, and Kawhi were all assassinated and here we are.  Assuming there's not another year like this anytime soon, I think it's probably a player that's already a perennial All-NBA person.  We're at a point where James Harden will never even be the best play on a title team.  I'm going to say maybe Dame Lillard or Jayson Tatum or Anthony Davis or Jokic or Giannis.  I mean, it's gotta be someone really good.  Here's the last 10 years:  2020: Lebron    2019: Kawhi    2018: KD    2017: KD    2016: Lebron    2015: Steph    2014: Kawhi or Duncan or Parker maybe?    2013: Lebron    2012: Lebron     2011: Dirk    &amp;#x200B;  That's an insane list.  You have to go back to 2004 to find someone that isn't one of the greatest basketball players of all time."
"You *can't* use players that won titles? You're kinda fucking us here but let's give it a go:  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Antoine Walker  C: Bob McAdoo?  Reggie Lewis vs Jaylen Brown was tough for me, but we never really got to see Reggie's prime. I also *wanted* to put IT here, especially considering how Kyrie's Celtics tenure went, but I can't really argue that IT was the better player. We only had Bob McAdoo for 20 games, but he was still pretty damn good that year, so fuck it, it counts. He's better than Ed Macauley."

"The bar for first option on a championship team is incredibly high (you essentially have to be a top 5 overall player in the league). Incredible offensive players (like Paul George, Dame Lillard, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Carmelo, etc.) haven’t even come that close to winning as a #1 option. SGA’s shown exponential improvement, but unless he continues ascending to literally top 5 levels, saying he’s best served as a second-banana isn’t an insult."
Jayson Tatum
"Yes if you can get the Blazers to accept an offer of Timelord, Nesmith, all the picks etc you should do that instead. But that's a fantasy world.

You spelled Jayson Tatum wrong.
They let you play as long as you go through their protocols.  You can still play while suffering from the after effects.  Just look at what happened with Jayson Tatum.  He suffered from breathing impairment after coming back and played anyway.
"you are of course right re. blame and responsibility for following protocols - all of that is ultimately on the individual, and unless some insider dishes on a name-by-name basis, it's just unfair speculation (i.e., fallacy that all those who followed/didn't follow protocols were/weren't infected).  but as a classic cynical celtics fan, the problem with the org has ultimately been that the front office has been too fucking crafty in acquiring that ""third superstar"" and consequently disrespecting the GENERATIONAL talent combo of jaylen and jayson. danny has this predilection for undersized guards because he was one, and it screws the trade value of acquiring quality roleplayers to complement our superstars' skills. no one should be getting paid more than them.   this is a fucking essay and a half but i'm just chomping at the bit to give context lol.  stevens got clout for taking rag-tag players and skyrocketing their value by playing them properly in min-max situations (isaiah thomas is on the floor no matter how shit his defense). as far as i'm concerned, danny kept wasting that net growth in value on the next ""superstar guard"" (kyrie, kemba), which is fucked up considering how ace the celtics front office was in doing the tatum pick and giving brown that payday."
"Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Luka, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph Curry, Jayson Tatum, Zion.   16 players that we both agree are better or on the same tier as trae. I personally think there are more that are on the same tier but this is the agreed upon list. How do you not understand what I'm saying when i say that Trae is not top 15. Im a fan of trae i think he's great. I'm not hating on Trae at all. He's a top 20 player."
"Marv Albert: ""Now they're saying Jayson Tatum and Bradley Beal will become the next hosts of Jeopardy"""
"I agree.   There's a huge difference between shooting 1,000 shots in the gym and practicing your shot 1,000 times.   Ben isn't pushing himself to be better and you can only get so far on pure athletic skills and ability.....you need to improve skills.   Jayson Tatum was just a mid range shooter coming into the league.  Now, he's an above average 3 pt shooter and has out up 50 pt games.   Brooke Lopez, Lebron, even Embiid have worked on their shots and become decent to good shooters from range.  And there is absolutely no excuse to be a below 75% free throw shooter at that level."
Jayson Tatum gonna retire to coach the Wizards
"No Dame? Gotta include Lillard on there. And Kyrie is a draw. Not sure on the level of his Nets teammates (especially Joe Harris, obvs) but people pay to see him play.  IMO you have to find space for Jayson Tatum. Love watching him play, and he's got talent and swag at such an early age.  Don't forget Zion, either. He still carries name value."
"Due to the shortened offseason, teams can trade recently-acquired players just 19 days after acquiring them.   **I am aware that the following would never happen. I just got a kick out of thinking about it and wanted to share.**  Imagine if Brad Stevens decides to blow it up and does this in a few weeks:   Thunder get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Jayson Tatum  Celtics get:   * Kemba Walker  * Luguentz Dort  * Theo Maledon  * Aleksej Pokusevski  * 13 1sts (the max OKC can send at this point)   Celtics basically inherit the OKC rebuild, minus Shai. Meanwhile OKC now goes forward with Shai/Brown/Tatum/Bazley/Bradley. I'm sure they could improve with free agent signings or other trades, too."
"Yeah, that's definitely the right move.   My dream would be Jayson Tatum demanding out of Boston and we offer Wiggins, Wiseman, one or both of the guys we draft this year (if desired), Poole maybe, and future picks for him. Can't think of a team that can realistically make a better offer than that. What contender could offer them the quality of Wiggins, Wiseman, Moody, 2023 1st, 2025 1st, 2027 1st, for example?

Bc Jimmy was better than jayson this year. Also if you’re bringing up stats include assists and rebounds otherwise it looks like you’re purposefully omitting something to play Tatum up
"Career TS% for a star as in for Jayson Tatum, not for Jimmy Butler. And you mentioned the playoffs.  The only run he had with elite efficiency was 2021 in the bubble.  “This is true for most players”  Which is my point. The difference between the two is Jimmy Butler no longer can shoot. So those dips that he used to have are going to become much more pronounced when the reality that he CANT SHOOT becomes more obvious.   “Elevate” doesn’t imply just TS%. Volume matters and volume matters A LOT come playoff time. Tatum in his last two years alone has hit higher playoff volumes than Butler has EVER had, all while rivaling or straight up destroying him in efficiency. Butler will CONTINUE to struggle while Tatum will not.   Tatum PPG increases   2018 - +5 2019 - -0.5 2020 - +2 2021 - +4   He’s done this maintaining relatively the same efficiency.   “Not really, he was incredible efficient last postseason without a jumpshot”   Except that was in the bubble where he suddenly received a respectable jumper. Which is what I explained prior…  So no, it’s not “marginally” different. Jimmy Butler will largely become more matchup based in terms of playoff performance just like every other guard in the league that cannot shoot.  The Lakers were quite literally going under Jimmy Butler screens and had whoever the fuck before finally putting AD on him. The DHOs of the Heat were clearly a problem lmao. He looked great against the Bucks last year when they wouldn’t even put Giannis on him and didn’t have Jrue or PJ. He then struggled against Smart, Tatum, Brown, before finally feasting on Lakers dumb strategy and weaker guards."
Oh really? Thats cool you get to hang out with Jayson Tatum!
Sounds like a certain Markelle Fultz-Jayson Tatum trade.

"here's what I will say for Jordan as someone who was alive (albeit a kid, born in 85) when he played.  MJ was a singular force and was by far the best &amp; most popular athlete of that era.  Contrary to what many believe, he did not play against milkmen, there were tons of legends in the 80s &amp; 90s that are all-time players that Jordan went against, and he subjugated them all.  MJ was head &amp; shoulders above the rest of his peers in a way that LeBron hasn't been in his career.  It's up for debate when LeBron passed Kobe, a lot of people say 2012, and for 3 seasons LeBron was the undisputed best player in the world until Curry &amp; KD came along (and then Harden, and Kawhi, and Giannis, and now Luka).  Once MJ passed Bird &amp; Magic there was nobody else even remotely in his stratosphere for an entire decade.  By the 90s, MJ was so far ahead of everyone else and so dominant that he was inevitable in a way that LeBron hasn't been.     As a kid, you KNEW the Bulls were going to win, it was a question of when, not if.  Jordan redefined the sport and is still influencing &amp; impacting the game today.  When you see Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum &amp; others, they're all doing a Kobe impression, and Kobe was doing a Jordan impression.  Jordan was the best offensive player AND the best defensive player in the NBA at his peak, and his statistics are absolutely bananas in a vacuum and doubly so when considering the era he played in.  Regardless of whether you consider stats, career achievements, influence on the game or really anything else, MJ is it.  I recommend that anyone who is able to finds a copy of *Playing For Keeps* by David Halberstam to get the most complete Jordan experience, cannot recommend that book highly enough."
Lebron was playing through an injury at an age where his HOF peers could barely run up and down the court. Calling him a quitter is crazy.   Do you think Jayson Tatum is a quitter because he left a playoff game after getting poked in the eye? Because Lebron stays in the game when that happens to him. Do you think Donovan Mitchell is a quitter because he missed Game 1 of the playoffs with a high ankle sprain? Because LeGrampa still went out there and played.
"Haha ok it was serious, yikes.   Every single coach that doesn’t win a championship (29 out of 30 coaches) “lose” each year…  Lost 3 ecf means he won more in the playoffs than almost every other coach in the last few years. Would you trade that for an actual championship? Of course. Does that make him a loser, especially with the inputs he was given? Lol. You’re saying he’s a “loser” for losing in the ecf. Applying that logic around the league, I can’t imagine what other coaches are. Look at other coaches over that same span.  You’re also calling him a loser for not winning a national championship with Butler, not winning a championship with the 2018 celtics led by rookie Jayson Tatum, and for not winning a championship with last year’s celtics team (without Hayward). Overachieving to get them there in the first place makes him a “loser”.   You think he traded kemba a first pick because he wanted Al Horford that bad as a massive talent increase? Look at anything about the trade, it was about money and paving financial flexibility.   No, he hasn’t been at Butler in 8 years. But go with whatever timeline you care to make up.   You probably still want to run with your take you like, but this is wildly misguided lol."
All of my Jayson Tatum is overrated takes
"The best tough shot maker at power forward is Jayson Tatum. He was listed at small forward this season which is odd to me because if Smart and Kemba are in the backcourt, then Brown is the SF, making Tatum the PF."
"I think he's being overrated due to being misevaluated in the sense of what type of player he's going to be at the NBA level, there's this misconception out there that he's going to be like Luka who is ball dominant and runs a million pick and rolls a game, and that's just not Cade's game at all.   He plays much more like some of the prominent wings we have in this game, like a Paul George or Jayson Tatum in that he's not ball dominant and he probably isn't going to have elite assist numbers."
"Agreed. I saw someone say on Twitter yesterday which I 100% agreed with.   It's OK to think Green, Suggs, or Mobley will have a better NBA career, but its not OK  to think that Cade won't at least have a very good one.  Part of what makes Cade so good is that his floor is so high, even if you want to criticize his ballhandling, that pretty much just makes him rookie Jayson Tatum with a better stepback"
"I think you’re overselling his defense. He’s averaging 1.2 steals, not 1.7, same as a guy like Fournier. 1 on 1 isn’t the most impactful form of defense but he’s not doing it too well anyway even if he’s had his moments. Guys are shooting 2.7% better vs him than their normal, .7% better vs Bogdan and worse vs all other rotation players.  I just don’t see the argument for him being above, say, 40% of the guys in the league. From my eye test, he seems to mess up rotations and gamble on plays a bit too much. Defensive stats are flawed but being abysmal in each one raises questions: he’s tied for 245th of 250 players in RAPTOR; 536th of 539 guys in LEBRON, tied for 165th of 179 in d-bpm; 404th of 500 in d-epm including two way guys/10 day contracts/end of bench guys.  I think you’re ignoring a lot of Tatum’s game. All those skills you mention are things he has and which have been recognized by other people connected to the league. Among others,  Nash has praised his guard-like ball handling and three level shooting while Steph talked about his “skill set” becoming lethal as he’s learned how to “manage the game”.  And, most recently, the comments from KD.   He started by praising Tatum’s skills saying “he’s shifty” and “just so good off the dribble” and “you don’t want to give up the three” but he also “can finish over bigs” and is “a tough tough cover”. Durant called it “an honor to play against him” and said when he “tally marks” players he’s had series against like “Kobe, Lebron, Tim Duncan, the Memphis Grizzlies - Jayson Tatum is in that conversation”. Also said he hates they’re in the same conference because his team is “going to be battling them year in and year out”."

"I don’t like Jayson Tatum.  I met him years ago in Boston during the Eastern Conference Finals while he was rushing at the basket.  He wasn’t a big star at this time and it didn’t seem like a risk to contest him.  The ball came toward me and as he ran up, I said “yo what’s up Jayson Tatum!” He boomed the fuck out of me and said, “what did you call me?” I replied, “Jayson Tatum.  What should I call you?”  And he replied, “how about “so good”? and walked away.  All I could say was “he’s so good” as my girlfriend asked me who I was gonna work out with this summer."

Jayson Tatum said that he wanted to go to Phoenix before the draft because of the warm weather and cause he could get a nice house.
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"If he was taking at 3rd and Embiid was taken at 1st I think he'd have way less of the bust reputation. He's now in his prime and has become a 20/5/3 player with good defense and decent shooting splits. Easily the second best player in the top 10 from 2014 and easily the third best in the lottery from that year (Lavine is higher).   Past 10 3rd overall picks: Kanter, Beal, Otto Porter, ""Wiggins"" for the sake of discussion, Okafor, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Luka, RJ, Lamelo. Wiggins belongs right in the middle of those guys."

The Clippers really aren't that great of a team when Terrence Mann isn't playing like Super Saiyan Rookie Jayson Tatum. The fact that these games are as close as they are with Phoenix playing at home still indicates how important CP3 is to the team.
"By that standard, you could also do Jayson Tatum and Jason Kidd"
"the nets traded for james harden which seemed like a guarantee for a title but kyrie/kd/harden we’re all hurt at some point in the season and eventually 2/3 got hurt in the playoffs so they got taken care of by a healthier bucks squad.  the 6ers were the one seed and looked good in the regular season but their lack of playmaking and shooting came back to bite them in the ass vs an atlanta squad with shooting and playmaking + some pretty good rebounders. also ben simmons had the worst 2 weeks  of basketball games in his life, probably.   the heat, even though they were the surprise finals team of last year, still massively disappointed as they suffered from the quick finals turn around -&gt; regular season + injuries and covid throughout the year ruining any flow to the team.   everyone else out east pretty much followed the script we expected them to follow. jayson tatum went nuclear and took a game off the nets in the first round by scoring 50 and the wizards took a game off the 6ers in similar fashion."

Winning an NBA championship means you're the best in the world, but getting to own a gold medal you get to stand next to someone who's the best skier or shotputter too."

"What? This is jibberish. ""Covid"" is not a technical term for anything, it's a colloquialism for SARS-CoV-2, as is ""the coronavirus"". Chris Paul has surely tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as have millions of people, but he's also reportedly not showing any symptoms, again, just like millions of other people.   When you get a PCR test they test to see if you're currently showing an infection with the virus, and apparently Chris Paul came back positive. For some people this means they'll eventually develop acute symptoms or even die, while for others they'll remain asymptomatic. Chris Paul appears to be in the latter category, and being vaccinated probably is a big reason why. The vaccines not only help prevent you from becoming infected, but also limit the severity of your infection if you get it.   Jayson Tatum didn't get a different virus than Chris Paul, it's just that he wasn't vaccinated at the time and he was one of the unlucky ones who developed more severe symptoms. You need to stop spreading this misinformation. There are not two separate diseases, it's not akin to HIV causing AIDS. It's just that the virus kills some people while leaving others asymptomatic, and everything in between. But everyone who gets it is a risk to infect others, and that's why CP3 is in the health and safety protocols."
"&gt;Turn things around from what exactly  Did you miss all of last season? From *that*. If things don't turn around in the next two years then you'll be looking at three straight seasons of mediocrity. Do you think Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum will be swayed by stuff that happened 4 years earlier with a different coach and front office? Cause I don't.   As a Celtics fan you better hope that Brad Stevens knows what he's doing. His first move saved the Celtics some money but odds are it made the team worse in the short term. Boston needs to be back in the conference finals and looking like they're on the path to a title, and right now they look to be a long ways from any of that."

"""Jayson Tatum led the Celtics to Game 7 of the conference finals when he was just a rookie.""  The Celtics' playoff run in 2018 was built on great defense and a balanced scoring attack.

Jayson Tatum upvotes
"&gt;It’s not just as easy as “CJ score, Ben not score”. What Ben does over 92’ translates to more efficient offense, even if he isn’t scoring himself. The team composition welcomes Ben’s more limited offensive skillset than the current situation in Philly.  I want to agree with you, but the Blazers are already the 4th most efficient offense in the NBA, and 5th highest scoring so the margins for improvement are pretty small. I'm not exactly sure how Dame's top ten efficiency would be improved by removing the ball from his hands? And you are massively underrating CJ's offense. Just look at the stats. He compares favorably to Jayson Tatum and Michael Porter on the offensive end. I'm not sure how you could make the argument that adding a dude with the most baffling offensive mental block in NBA history over a top 40 offensive player somehow improves the offense...and you are saying ***I'm*** peak enlightened fan?"
"&gt;In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.    &gt;The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.  &gt; &gt;22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable.  You are out of your mind on a lot of those.   In no particular order:   1) kyrie - this dude has done fuck all but get injured and be a cancer ever since Cleveland. This dude is whatever the opposite of a leader is. Kyrie absolutely shit the bed with a far better Celtics roster than what the hawks have.   2) Klay hasn't played in two years now. He's also not better than Trae young. Klay is a great supporting player, but he's not the type of player than can carry a team like Trae young has.   3) Westbrook? That one is absolutely laughable. While I have my disagreements with some of these players, Westbrook is clearly not as good as Trae young at this point in his career. How many times does Westbrook have to blow a close game for you to see this?  4) Ja Morant hasn't done anything to really show that he's on traes level. He's a good player. But he still can't shoot and it hinders his game.   5) There is no way in hell Rudy gobert is a better player than Trae young.   6) I wouldn't take Jimmy Butler over Trae Young. This hawks team is a worse roster than Miami had a year ago. And Jimmy Butler had a pretty forgettable year tbh. Maybe he bounces back next year.   7) CP3 is probably a wash at best. At his best he's better than Trae, but he can't carry a team like Trae can due to years of injuries and milage. Pick your poison. I'd take Paul in a single game, but Trae for an entire year  8) Tatum is debatable at best. I would say they are on the same tier. Same with Paul George."

From Colangelo being a complete Douchebag, drafting Markelle Fultz instead of Jayson Tatum, plus giving Danny Ainge 2 Lottery Pick 1st rounders, to the Jimmy Buckets trade  for Roco &amp; Saric and having Butler tell Brett Brown and Brand, umm thanks but no thanks,Ben Blows I'm signing with Miami, to all of the other wasted Lottery Picks, Noel, MC Williams, Okafor.....and NOW SIMMONS....fuckin joke....total joke  &amp;#x200B;  And dont think Embiid didn't blow in Game 6 &amp; 7.....8 TOs in each game....WTF ....yeah he is an MVP....not"
"Nothings wrong with that, this is literally basic science you human goldfish. Ask Jayson Tatum if he’d have rather caught COVID before or after his vaccine. Dude was still using an inhaler a month after he recovered because it beat his ass that bad.   And Jayson Tatum is 23 year old athlete in the physical prime of his life. Meanwhile CP3 is doing Tik Tok’s with his kids and basically just waiting for the green light from the league"
let's add Jayson Tatum since they traded him for Fultz
"Yeah when Devin Booker and Jayson Tatum are your 7th and 8th guys, your team is fucking stacked."
yup he is  edit: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/team-usa-basketball-jayson-tatum-bradley-beal-devin-booker-commit-to-play-in-tokyo-olympics-per-reports/
imagine if the sixers had jaylen brown and jayson tatum instead of ben simmons and markelle fultz (RIP)   TRUST THE PROCESS
"Markelle Fultz:  June 19, 2017: Traded by the Boston Celtics **(as a future 2017 1st round draft pick)** to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected). (Future 1st-Rd pick will either be LAL's 2018 pick if it falls between 2 &amp; 5, or the better of PHI &amp; SAC's 2019 picks, unless it is the #1 pick)"
Trae and Luka are the two best 22 year olds in basketball (Jayson Tatum is cold too)
2014 Zach LaVine instead of Randle  2015 Devin Booker instead of Russell   2016 Ingram was fine  2017 Jayson Tatum instead of Lonzo Ball   2018 Gary Trent Jr instead of Mo Wagner
PG: Jamal Murray (2016)  SG: Devin Booker (2015)  SF: Michael Porter Jr (2018)  PF: Jayson Tatum (2017)  C: Joel Embiid (2014)
Yeah but if trading for Kyrie/Kemba was the right move then not trading for Kawhi was also the right move.  You can't ignore hindsight in one case and then bring up hindsight in another.   * The Kyrie/Kemba trades made sense at the time but were detrimental in hindsight.   * The Kawhi trade made no sense at the time but would have been hugely beneficial in hindsight.  The AD trade wouldn't have done much for us because it would have cost us Brown + Smart + picks as a bare minimum. Tatum and AD aren't winning a chip the way LeBron + AD did.  So now the only other trades we missed were Jaylen/Jayson for Paul George or Jimmy Butler and quite frankly I'd rather have Jaylen/Jayson.
Did you know the 6ers traded up to take Markell Fultz over Jayson Tatum tho. I might have to make a thread
"Jayson Tatum: ""DOES THIS MEAN I GET TO BE RUNNER UP NOW, I WAS THE 3RD LEADING SCORER FOR AN ECF TEAM"""
"I'm sure you can do this for pretty much every team, but here are the players they missed out on during the Process era:  2013: Giannis  2015: Booker  2016: Jaylen Brown  2017: Jayson Tatum  2018: SGA, or keep Mikal Bridges"
"Jayson Tatum has a fucked up looking, slow release.   Human catapult but great at it."
Steph  Klay  Kawhi  KD  Anthony Davis   Chris Paul Kyle Lowry  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Bam   Zion  Booker
Now he can become Jayson Tatum on the Wizards.
jayson tatum has to use an inhaler now you can do it bro
We have Kevin Durant and Jayson tatum playing Nicholas batum and Timothy luwaru cabaret
I say the Celtics not only are him and lebron gonna face off a lot but him and a developing jaylen brown and Isaiah Thomas but it’s interesting on where jayson tatum will be drafted
"Boston trades: Markelle Fultz  Boston receives: Jayson Tatum, Romeo Langford and Markelle Fultz"
"The Celtics have traded Jayson Tatum for David Duke, sources tell ESPN"
Yeah that Kuzma kid looks promising. Reminds me of Jayson Tatum but a bit more skilled
mikal bridges &gt; jayson tatum and it’s not even close
Gregg popovich best bet to win gold this year is  Pg jrue holiday or dame  Sg khris Middleton Sf jayson tatum  Pf draymond green or Keldon Johnson  C bambam or javele McGee
Cool that Duarte’s wife let Jayson Tatum sit on her lap.

Jayson Tatum
"Hi Jake, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA.  What are you’re thoughts on Beal asking out of Washington and if he did is his relationship with Jayson Tatum a potential factor in where he asks to go?"
Maybe jayson Tatum?
"*[Wojnarowski] BREAKING: The Oklahoma City Thunder have agreed to trade the 2035 No. 1 pick, expected to be Duke's Jayson Tatum Jr, to the Philadelphia 76ers, league sources tell ESPN. More details to follow.*"
*[Wojnarowski] ESPN Sources: The Oklahoma City Thunder have landed on a decision to select Duke's Jayson Tatum Jr. with the No. 1 pick in 2035's NBA Draft (ESPN and ABC at 8 PM ET).*
He can still be a Franchise player without being a lead ballhandler. I just compared him to Jayson Tatum! His shooting talent at his size is his separating skill. Over 40% from three with the diet of shots he was taking is elite. I hope he does well too. I like Detroit’s rebuild so far
Jayson Tatum - 7th grader
"I don’t get why the consensus is that Cade is an oversized point guard. He has solid vision but was very turnover prone in College. I think he will end up more as a secondary playmaker in the vein of Khris Middleton or Jayson Tatum. Still worthy of the 1st pick, but a different archetype"
"As a Celtics fan, I was fairly confident he was going to re-sign with OKC, but thought that if he left for ANYWHERE it would be Boston.  Didn't think he'd break the NBA by going to GS, and none of his other suitors seemed primed to win-now and win for the forseeable future as the Celtics did.  KD, Horford, Crowder, Smart, IT (or maybe Kyrie), Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum.  Wouldn't have automatically been title favorites but it would've been a great team that could have competed with Lebron's Cavs to go to the Finals."
"I disagree, one of his best defensive attributes is his ability to help on weakside rim protection rotations which is often the role of the 4 in zone schemes. More and more we're seeing more ""wings"" at the 4 than ""bigs"" - guys like Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Tobias Harris are the biggest concerns in the East on that side of the ball (outside of Giannis, who, lets be real is a PF in the body of a C), not to mention just defending the corner 3 in general from 4 out teams. 4s in the modern game have to be able to defend the perimeter.  My preference is Cam at the 3, Hunter at the 4 long-term like the Celtics use Brown/Tatum."
We lost the Melo trade 1000% huge turning point for our franchise. Brooklyn in no way won the Boston trade- things turned out great for them down the line but they could’ve had Jayson Tatum and I forget who else right to pair with their stars or dangle as trade assets
"Jayson Tatum, Kevin love, Marcus smart, Richard Jefferson, iman Schimper…. I could list all of them"
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
How's it a false equivalency? You used pretty demeaning words to describe a grown woman. Would you call Jayson Tatum a little boy? If you're repeating something he said that I didn't see then nevermind
This is someones daughter.  is never a good fuckin reason to try and rally people on your side.  ivanka trump is someones daughter.  lol.  what the fuck kind of parent reasoning bull fuckin shit is this?  this is why people are not that patient with parents.

Is it that hard to be supportive and empathetic to what others are going through? This is someone’s son and his health your referring to.

"most of the other young up and coming stars in the league right now, even if their personalities vary, have some sort of youthful energy to them, except for Jayson Tatum. he legit has the energy of 35 year old dad."
"Jayson Tatum, the 6 foot 8 guard, with a good game"
Yes. Although I double checked because I thought his language envisioning her as a daughter sounded a bit weird from a famously young guard.  Simone Biles is fifty weeks older than Jayson Tatum!

The virus has serious impacts on people even if you're young and healthy. Like I said, dying isn't the only outcome to care about.   ""Covid does nothing to healthy people"" is objectively untrue."
"Jayson Tatum has played 29 more games in the league than Embiid despite being drafted 3 years later. He's also 4 years younger than Embiid, give or take 13 days. In fact, Jokic is almost an entire year younger than Embiid, even Giannis is younger than him."
"**Fox Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""The Sixers made a no-brainer trade for the first pick, and now they'll make the no-brainer choice with the selection.""  Tatum 3: ""Taking the Duke forward with the first pick would have been a reach. Trading down to No. 3 allows Ainge to take the guy he wants without facing a ton of criticism (and while adding another asset down the line).""  **Sports Illustrated**  Fuiltz 1: Mocking this one is like getting extra credit for spelling your name correctly.   Tatum 3: This could be Josh Jackson (who may have greater value in a deal), but the better fit for Boston would be Tatum, thanks to his potential to space the floor, play some power forward and become a go-to scorer down the line.  **Bleacher Report:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Markelle Fultz remains the favorite to go No. 1, even if the Boston Celtics trade the pick.""  Tatum 5: ""The Sacramento Kings won't be happy to see the Phoenix Suns grab De'Aaron Fox. But Fox going top four means Jayson Tatum slips to No. 5, where he stands out as a strong candidate for best player available.""  **Chad Ford:**  Fuiltz 1: ""That all-around style of play would be a welcomed addition alongside Ben Simmons and the 76ers' numerous young big men to help round out the roster and start the organization's ascent up the standings in the Eastern Conference.""  Tatum: 3: ""It will likely come down to the Celtics then picking Jackson sight unseen or going with Tatum, who might wind up fitting better in the long term.""  **CBS Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Is Fultz ""can't-miss""? He's as close as there is to can't-miss as there is in this draft""  Tatum 3: ""It may prove to be the smart decision, seeing that the Celtics have plenty of flexibility in the near future. (If things break the right way, there's a chance the Celtics could have high lottery picks from the Nets and Lakers next season.) ""  Many of these were saying that the biggest issue with Tatum over Jackson was that Jackson refused to meet with the Celtics. It's likely they would have had Jackson over Tatum, if that didn't happen.  When people are saying Fuiltz is ""as close as there is to 'can't-miss'"", ""Sixers will make a no-brainer choice"", and ""Remains the favorite even if Boston trades the pick"" implies that the majority of people and analysts thought Fuiltz was clearly the better talent.  When they are trying to figure out if the C's should take Tatum over Jackson, when Jackson refused to workout with them, then you know the perceived talent disparity between Fuiltz/Tatum is more then the draft positions of 1-3, rather then the opposite argument which you are making.  Just because Ainge Zigged when everyone else Zagged doesn't change that 95% of the people thought Fuiltz had more talent."
"Because they can.  30 pounds is relative though.  If you're talking about Trae Young adding 30 pounds of muscle, then no, that's probably not reasonable.  If you're talking about Jayson Tatum adding 30 pounds of muscle between 19-25, then yes, that's totally reasonable.  Until they get to the NBA, none of these guys have the time to truly dedicate themselves to the sport.  School takes up an awful lot of their weeks."

I was clearly being hyperbolic comparing him to MCW.   Saying Cade Cunnighams FLOOR is Jayson Tatum is just bad basketball analysis in general if you were being completely serious. He literally has shown an drop of the scoring instincts and moves of Tatum. He’s not nearly as shifty or even as explosive. He isn’t faster laterally.
Calling someone’s floor Jayson Tatum is honestly incredibly ridiculous.   And I think they can.
"Rotation needs to be cut down by a lot. No need to be playing Keldon Johnson 9 mins. KD was in a bit of foul trouble vs France which can explain why he only played 20 mins, but he needs to be playing 30+ in important games going forward. One of Bam/Draymond needs to be on the floor at all times in any important game. I really don’t see the need for Lavine to be starting or even playing at all. Middleton, Holiday, and Booker are strictly better and should take over all of his minutes by the elimination stage.   The next two games for Team USA should be easy to win, so Pop should use those 2 games to get a fixed gameplay/style of play and to find the right number of players in the shortened rotation. The biggest problem is there is no identity with this team. It’s not even the lack of chemistry - it’s not like Luka played with Mike Tobey prior to the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Matisse Thybulle never played with Australia prior to the Olympics. The Nigeria team that beat Team USA in the exhibition had even fewer reps playing with each other than the US team did. It’s just that guys like Mike Tobey and Matisse Thybulle know their role.   Players like Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker, etc. don’t know their role on this team - it needs to be made clear to them they play defense and play more of a 3rd/4th option to KD/Lillard on offense or they get benched. That’s why it’s easier for Jrue Holiday to adjust - he already played this role with the Bucks, unlike the other stars who were #1 options on their teams. And if you don’t want to bench or threaten to bench Jayson Tatum or Zach Lavine for the entire game because they are “too good” be benched, well that’s why they won’t win."
"Pop needs to actually just tell the players that KD is the #1 option, Lillard is the #2 option and everyone else play like role players. That means Jayson Tatum will only be spacing the floor/spotting  up/playing defense from now on. Zach Lavine will only be taking open jump shots/focusing on defense…etc. The only issue is I only see Draymond, Bam, Jrue Holiday, and possibly Middleton understanding this concept though (I guess Keldon and Jeremi Grant might but they just aren’t good enough).   This next game (since the USA is guaranteed to win) would be a good time to practice this concept in the first few quarters where Durant clearly is the lead dog and everyone else plays more specialized roles. Look how Luka played with Slovenia last night. This is how Team USA should structure their team, with clearly a pecking order. And it’s not like Luka had much “chemistry” with guys like Mike Tobey beforehand so this isn’t some chemistry issue that doesn’t affect other teams (Nigeria beat Team USA and their team is even newer than the one USA has). Otherwise players like Lavine and possibly even Tatum, despite how good he might be, should get benched imo since they don’t offer anything extra of value."
"Dude our drafts under Zach Kleiman have been insane. Like getting Ja is pretty easy, second pick take best player available. But he also found Brandon Clarke who was the steal of that draft, and last year found Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman at 30 and 35.   The only players who shot better from deep as rookies than Bane in the last ten years were Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum. I think in a few seasons people are going to be scratching their heads why Bane went so late.  Tillman was also a good find, I think he's a solid backup big who will stick around in the league a long time.  Grizz fans aren't overlooking that we didn't just trade up the first round pick. 10 and 40 instead of 17 and 51, Kleiman just might find two more solid pieces."
"How does me saying Tatum was consensus 3-6 mean I have an agenda when it’s true lol.  [here is your link, it’s a “consensus mock draft”](https://www.nba.com/news/2017-consensus-mock-draft)  This consensus mock draft has Tatum #3, which falls into the category of consensus 3-6. Also in this consensus mock draft, Fultz goes #1.  Let’s look at [another consensus mock draft](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/2017-nba-consensus-mock-draft-final/)  In here it is the exact same. Markelle at #1, Tatum within the 3-6 range.  How about [1 more consensus mock](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2017/6/22/15852100/nba-draft-2017-final-consensus-mock-draft)  Here, once again we see Markelle go #1, but Tatum goes at number 4 behind Josh Jackson, which falls into the consensus 3-6 range.  These were the first 3 results when googling 2017 consensus mocks, completely randomly selected. In these we see a trend, Markelle at #1, Lonzo #2, and Jayson Tatum going in the 3-6 range.  That’s what consensus is. These are mocks by many draft experts who examine the NBA Draft for a living. You’re not gonna try and say they are “random people”, right?  I don’t know what more you want. It is clear that Markelle was the consensus number 1 overall pick, while Tatum fell within the 3-6 range.  I don’t know what else to say. This argument is stupid. You are calling people who provide for their families by analyzing the draft “random people on the internet” when they have platforms read by hundreds of thousands of NBA Fans who search “NBA Mock Draft”.   There were multiple mocks you can find that have Tatum behind Markelle, Lonzo, Jackson, Fox, and Dennis Smith Jr. that you can find. I do admit those are more rare, but they absolutely do exist.  I literally don’t know what else to say. The fact that this is even a discussion baffles me."

not sure why you had to mention jayson tatum in this comment tbh
He has almost 2x the following of your favorite player jayson tatum. Hype is not necessarily equal to ur skill level. He just has a larger following because he’s been followed for years now.
"Here are the two first results when you google 2017 NBA mock draft, both are from 2017.  https://www.nba.com/news/2017-mock-draft-third-edition  &gt;The pick for the Boston Celtics at No. 1 would have been Fultz … and the pick for the 76ers at No. 1 will be Fultz. Not only is he the top prospect in the Draft in a consensus of front offices, Fultz is practically an ideal fit for the 76ers because he can play off the ball with Ben Simmons or in place of Simmons if the 2016 first choice is resting or struggling in his transition to point guard.  This has Jayson Tatum going to the Kings at #5 with the Celtics taking Jackson at #3.  —————————————  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/5/16/15646832/nba-mock-draft-2017-markelle-fultz-boston-celtics-lonzo-ball-los-angeles-lakers  &gt;1. Boston Celtics — Markelle Fultz, PG, Washington  &gt;If you were making a modern NBA point guard in a lab, he would look a lot like Markelle Fultz. Every tool is here: size, speed, length, shooting, and the ability to finish above the rim. What really separates Fultz is his creativity off the bounce. Sometimes that means hitting open cutters with a pass. Sometimes it means finding new ways to score out of the pick-and-roll. There are a lot of great talents in this draft, but Fultz has emerged as the **easy** pick at No. 1. The Celtics should have themselves a franchise player."
"And to think Luka scored 20 more points than Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, and Damian Lillard combined for yesterday lol"
Jayson Tatum to be Kuzma's Robin
"You just aren’t reading or intaking what I’m saying. A big chunk of this team will be in their prime, instead of 2-3 years before it, come next Olympics. If you disagree on the value that adds, totally understandable, but honestly feels like you aren’t really understanding what I’m trying to say.  Jayson Tatum is likely a much better version of himself 4 years from now. So are Bam and Lavine."
"Duke University, known for its star white players like Zion Williamson and Jayson Tatum"
"In general I'm looking at the roster and surprised at how thin basketball players are. Jayson Tatum 6'8"" and 205 pounds? During the pandemic my 5'7"" friend got a ""dad bod"" and was 205 pounds and he just looked stocky, not fat. These weights are really low."
Good. He’s also got amazing chemistry with Tatum *on* the court that’s already been proven. And no need to waste resources trying to get a one year contract when we probably won’t be contenders next year anyway AND Beal will want to sign with us because of Jayson.

There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
"He as a player had covid and quad injuries. Jayson tatum had an inhaler trying to help the Celtics.  Only 1 seed ahead of the Wizards.

"We suck. You can really tell just how badly the NBA rules are destroying the game. Inside the bubble of the NBA, flopping, complaining, and traveling are all *highly effective* ways to win. Hell, James Harden became *mvp* off of traveling, flopping, and complaining.   But the international game is a little different. International basketball doesn’t allow traveling and some foreign ref might not give a damn about giving  Jayson Tatum preferential calls."

Bruh. Isos were nowhere to be found. Jayson Tatum and KD are the best isos in the game where were they?
You probably don’t watch much international basketball either cuz the US sent D list stars in 2019. The best players on that team were legit young Donovan Mitchell and jayson tatum
One whole nanosecond of jayson tatum
Jayson Tatum is the worst player on team USA. How could he let this happen

Jayson Tatum is the GOAT
"LOL. Reggie was really solid, but he was never even seen as a top 10 player in the NBA. Theres a reason he only got on 3 all NBA teams his entire career, and all were 3rd team.   He was a lot closer to a devin booker/bradley beal/jayson tatum level player at his peak than an MVP candidate who got robbed. Not meaning disrespect, but the rose tinted glasses on reggie are kinda wild."

"[ESPN] Does Jayson Tatum hate his teammates, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart?"

Jayson Tatum needs a burner account
There's a lot of capable scorers in the nba.   I just look at Jayson Tatum. He is on the same team as Brown. Takes a bigger offensive effort. But he's a huge plus defender because he pays attention on defense.   I don't expect Beal to chase Steph Curry or battle Giannis. But just pay attention and do the basics. Read the scouting report. Move your feet on occasion. Rotate when needed.   Edit: I don't mean to pick on just these guys. Its a league wide issue with stars.

Jayson Tatum. Bulking up a bit more allowing him to bang inside and add more fts with his deep bag. Pretty solid defense but also gun developing his playmaking is key. Oh yeah and the Celtics need a great record
jayson tatum for dbook straight up
Jayson Tatum. Dude needs some more shots though.
Jayson Tatum: my turn.
pass the ball to Jayson Tatum good things will happen I swear
I cant believe a 19 year old Jayson Tatum is playing for his countrymen
Jayson Tatum: THE YOUNGEST OLYMPIAN
Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum is going to win MVP next season. League about to be fucked hard.
Jayson Tatum regressed?
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
Jayson Tatum. He’s only 19!
Jayson Tatum
"The Boston is the best package for both teams. Brown is amazing fit in Boston but he is a cut below Dame level (superstar/mvp level) player. Dame and Jayson Tatum would be like CP3 and Booker on crack. Also completely and beautifully fills Boston's void at the PG position and with Horford back, Timelord, Thompson they aren't lacking bad with bigs to help out and they have shooters. Boston can throw in picks, Marcus Smart, or young players like Nesmith to sweeten the deal. Portland can remain competitive with a renewed identity centered around the defensive potential of JB + Smart. Possibly let Smart handle the ball. Not perfect for Portland but it's a situation where they have assets they can ship off if they want to fully rebuild or they can try to retool for a quicker turnaround. Team would need work though tbh before it could be championship level with Brown and McCollum as your best players. Could be a great free agent destination though if they have cap space idk if they do or not"
"When you think about it; Sixers could really have had Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, alongside Embiid. And that's just the start. Mad."
Healthy Nets barely 4-1’d Jayson Tatum calm down
JAYSON TATUM
The Jayson Tatum special
"PG: Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving (Efficiency is unmatched at guard, 50-40-90 club guys and champions. Ky was National Team MVP before)  SG: James Harden, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker (Need some D)  SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard (I mean....No explanation needed)  PF: LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Paul George  C: Anthony Davis, Karl Antony Towns (So many goods ones not from U.S)"
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-

"He’s actually right here.  I’ve always believed that Kuzma isn’t BAD, he’s just not playing a consistent role. When he had a consistent role around his rookie season, he was playing synonymous to Jayson Tatum.  Jayson Tatum has since had a solidified role, while Kuzma’s role has been waltzing around. Of course it’s going to be difficult to adjust.  Notice how every in stretch of games that Vogel decides to change Kuz’s role, Kuzma plays a little better and has actually been productive.  However, my man really needs to start hitting his shots because his misses have been singlehandedly the reason that the Lakers cannot close some games."
Jaylen Brown has a bigger impact &amp; a higher ceiling than Jayson Tatum.
"&gt; Western Conference executive 1: He has it. He surveys the game for the first 15, 20 minutes, then says “what do we need?” And he does it. He’s Scottie Barnes (Florida State’s forward, expected to go high in the Lottery) with a jump shot. That’s my problem with Scottie. (Cunningham)’s Jayson Tatum. Same size. Can score from anywhere on the court.  Strong endorsement."
"for context, in game checks alone, Jayson Tatum will have banked $325M when he's 28, at the end of the 25-26 season. We can assume the salary cap will have gone up a good bit by then, and if he's healthy and his career continues on its current trajectory, he gets another max deal. Say $250M over 5 years. So now he's 33 with $575M in game checks. And then maybe he gets $300M for 5 more years and walks off into the sunset with $875M in game checks at age 38. If he stays in Boston his whole career and US and MA tax code never changes by then, he takes home roughly $500+M of that.   Now, LeBron is a global icon and has been notoriously savvy with investments and marketing from pretty early on, and so expecting any current player to reach his level of off vs on court earnings is ridiculous. Only 4 of the top earners managed earn more in endorsements than game checks this year according to the Forbes article, one of which is Giannis but he will dip back below that line once his big extension kicks in. The others are Curry, KD, and of course LeBron. Curry and KD are much closer to a 50/50 split than the 2/3 vs 1/3 ratio LeBron has going.   So assuming Tatum can earn a third of his off court earnings off the court, he's looking at taking home another $150+M after taxes by the end of his career. $650M total, BEFORE any interest starts piling up. A little over 7% annual return doubles your money in ten years, so if he literally kept the money in cash under the biggest bed you've ever seen, and then decided to put it in a fund at 38, he'd have nearly $1.5B by the time he's 50.  Long post short, MJ crawled so LeBron could run, and LeBron ran so that tomorrow's phenoms can go to Mars."
Jayson tatum is not even the best PF in his own conference
Jayson Tatum is the best PF in the league and a top 8 player
I remember Jayson Tatum growing 2 inches lmao
[Jayson Tatum](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mz19ft/hi_rnba_im_jayson_tatum_of_the_boston_celtics_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) also did an AMA for Ruffles and it went much better.
you could also make an argument for jayson tatum tbh
I mean I'd say Doris wants that Tatum d more than anyone Rachel Nichols wants. Jayson Tatum? More like Jayson Tate-yum.
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O’Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De’Aaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who’s good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
And yet somehow Jayson Tatum is only 19
"From like... 1986 to... (uh) 1993 was really the heyday of sideline reporter scandals.  To see a top... (uh) 7 all-time reporter scandal in 2021 is just something we wouldn't have even phathomed... (uh) 20 months ago.  Like, if... (uh)  Jayson Tatum..."
"You've kind of answered your own question.   &gt;Without a superstar point guard to pair with **an elite wing (or two)**, is there any reason to think the Celtics have a higher ceiling than the George Hill/Paul George Pacers?  The Clippers have an elite offence because they have two elite wings who can initiate. As opposed to the Pacers who only had Paul George.   Just as a quick side-by-side here's the scoring hierarchy of the two George/Hill teams:  2013-14 Pacers| PPG ---|--- George| 21.7 West | 14.0 Stephenson |13.8 Bynum| 11.5 Hibbert |10.8  Hill | 10.3     2015-16 Pacers| PPG ---|--- George| 23.1 Ellis | 13.8 Hill | 12.1 Miles | 11.8 Turner | 10.3 Mahinmi | 9.3   The Pacers had a grind it out offence because they didn't have much talent offensively. It was Paul George + Role Players.    The Celtics have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, two wings who were top 20 in the league for scoring this past season. Then you add in Fournier and Horford. A wing and a big who can both score and act as secondary facilitators.  They just have a lot more firepower than what the Pacers were ever working with."
As Jayson Tatum progresses I don’t think there’s a need for a playmaking PG. Having Smart at PG is what I imagine the Clippers thought they were getting with Patrick Beverley.  And for all the talk about “Clippers need a real PG! Clippers need a PG!” they finished top 5 in offense each of the last two seasons.
"A walking bucket, a great defender and Jayson Tatum"
"Agreed, you get Malik Beasley and we get Jayson Tatum"
"Oh my bad bro. Idk pg13, lebron cp3 Nokia embiid. Anthony Davis Steph Klay KD harden Lillard. Jayson Tatum and Westbrook. Giannis ah maybe he's number 15!"
"I think they’d be competitive for the first half or three quarters of games 1 and 2. I honestly think Team USA sweeps.    Team USA’s sheer depth is insane. On a 12-man roster of their best players, their worst player would be someone like Jayson Tatum or Bradley Beal.    Luka, Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid can’t play the full the entire game. Their fit isn’t exactly great either—especially compared to Team USA."
Jayson Tatum said he does that I think
"So what does this comment mean?   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o63tww/alex_caruso_arrested_in_texas_on_marijuana_charges/h2q65lh/  Also, what do you get out of impersonating Jayson Tatum?"
"“Super well” is an interesting way to describe passing up on Jaylen brown and jayson Tatum for Lonzo ball and Brandon Ingram. Not a correct way, but definitely an interesting way."
This is the more reasonable take. The Hawks out-performed this year and fizzled out in the ECFs. We really wouldn't be having this conversation if the 76ers had their shit together.  I like the Jayson Tatum answer a lot more than the Trae Young answer cause it's a lot more likely someone with a physical presence on the court will win MVP than yet another high-scoring point guard who doesn't play defense.
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
I think jayson Tatum is in this subreddit as @jaysontatumofficial waiting on what he to has to say on here
Jayson Tatum played at an elite level his rookie year why are you diminishing that?
"Zach Lavine: 27.5/5/4.9 on .507/.419/.849 splits   Jayson Tatum: 26.4/7.4/4.3 on .459/.386/.868 splits.  Nothing there that says Tatum is better than Lavine, unless you value a couple extra rebounds over more scoring, passing and much better efficiency"
Healthy Nets big 3. Healthy Kawhi. Healthy Klay!! Continued development of Jayson Tatum and Luka hopefully making more noise in the playoffs.
and the 2nd option for the Pacers was Bogdanovic who averaged 12/3/2 on 39% from the field  Celtics were missing 2 All-Stars and led by a rookie Jayson Tatum  how many All-Stars does Lebron need to beat them?
"I agree with everything Jayson said but I also think there is another factor that Tatum isn't alluding to out of friendship. Kyrie is profoundly pompous and self righteous at his best, mentally unstable at his worst.   He is 100% misunderstood but he holds a lot of responsibility as to why he is misunderstood. He is a provocateur who insists that he doesn't want attention. He routinely makes outlandish statements and has a long history of throwing teammates under the bus, being a diva and even quitting on his team in a ECF game.  All the while he plays the whole ""why are you guys so obsessed with me"" dance with the media, acts like a child and constantly brings more attention upon himself. I don't even dislike Kyrie but I grew sick of his antics very quickly. He's a very unique fella to say the least."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De’Andre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
"Well I mean it's kind of weird to think about #1 picks because almost every time, the #1 pick isn't the best in the class   2020- LaMelo #3 (so far but can change) 2019- Ja #2(only because Zions health is a huge question for his career)  2018 - Luka #3 (I don't need to explain this one) 2017 - Jayson Tatum #3 (Markelle and Zo went before him)  2016 - Jaylen Brown #3  2015 - Devin Booker #13 2014- Nikola Jokic or Embiid at #41 and #3 respectively   And this is just in the last 7 draft classes, there are plenty more examples, and for quite a few of these there is obviously still plenty of time before their career are over, but right now none of the last 7 #1 picks are the best player in their draft. That's why the #1 pick isn't really as valuable to me in general because usually even if a guy seems like a can't miss, someone else could always end up being better"
Come 2025 Trae Young will be in LA teaming up with AD and Jayson Tatum
"marcus smart, evan fournier, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, and al horford."
"Hope Jayson Tatum still has room for improvement and get rid of Jaylen Brown for a real, better #2 option. Green teamers will dodge this and blame everyone else but at the end of the day, your team is as good as your best players. LeBron James was dragging worse rosters to deep Playoff runs year after year but two ""All-Stars"" struggled so much just to get in? Heck, is Julius Randle's supporting cast that much better than Boston's that New York is in the 4th seed but Boston needs to play in the Play-In?  Tatum has only shown flashes of superstardom while Brown is just a bad player."
Jayson Tatum a better shooter than both those scrubs
"Doris Burke is so influential for women in media and I respect her for that, but I'm also ready for her to retire. She chooses favorites and rides them hard. It's really annoying to listen to someone kiss the ass of players like Jayson Tatum and don't get me wrong, I like Tatum, I just don't like any commentator consistently kissing the ass of any player all game. Like one or two comments is fine, but she is unrelenting."
"seriously, what is it with this post and people pulling out their completely un-updated Jayson Tatum takes from 2019"
-Someone who doesn’t watch Jayson Tatum play
Jayson Tatum 2.0.
Not everyone can be Jayson Tatum
"This time his father wasn't that loud so kinda nothing.  I had a good feeling about jayson tatum just because of his name.  Luka in favour because of real Madrid.  For some reason I usually am not in favour of small guards like trea, vanvleet (like the fact that he goes from undrafted to starter, underdog shizz).  Didn't like when we got Tyrell Terry with 31.  I want teams to draft bigs or fast players in 2nd round.safer bet compared to guards I think."
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
B is definitely Damien Lillard.  A is certainly Jayson Tatum.  I think OP accidentally swap the defense/playmaker descriptions across the two.  I go Jayson Tatum cause I’m a Celtics fan
"That’s still Lebron, Jokic, and PG   Compare that to some of the star power Lebron faced through the years in the east. Like that legendary 2018 run was through Oladipo, the trash bros, and teenage Jayson Tatum   The Suns got lucky but everyone does, and as time goes on nobody cares"
If you are suggesting a team with 19 year old Jayson Tatum as their best player had title contention potential then I don’t know what to tell you man.
"I was looking at ESPN statistics and I realize now that the way they calculated their statistics is stupid bc they just took the average of all the fg% without taking how many into account. So yours is more accurate but my point still stands. Do you think jayson Tatum is the reason why the Celtics lost? According to you, in the same reasoning as pg, he shot them out of the game bc he had the same fg%"
"  Player | FG% | 3PT% | FT% ---|---|----|---- Damian Lilliard | 46 | 45| 94 Jayson Tatum | 42 | 39 | 92 Trae Young | 43 | 33 | 87 Paul George (FULL) | 44 | 34 | 84 Paul George (v Suns) | 42 | 29 | 77  Cmon man just be objective for a second. It's obvious that PG played terrible, especially in the Suns series. That Sun's series is actually the most accurate comparison between all of these players because Tatum and Dame are both the first option on their team, and PG was the first option for the Clipps in their series against the Suns. There's not way you can spin PG's playoff run in a positive light.  Also, LMFAO @ comparing PG to Trae. Trae is in his 3rd year in the league, this was his first playoff run, and he is a known chucker and low-efficiency player. And even with all those caveats, Trae still played better this post season than George did vs the Suns (again, Trae is the 1st option so you have to compare to when PG was 1st option too)."
"Jayson Tatum, Kyrie, Booker all can have Kobe-like moments, hell even PG/Kawhi sometimes. But there will never be another Kobe. Booker doesn’t have the athleticism, JT missing the fluidity and willingness to jack up volume, Kyrie length. But they don’t need to be another Kobe, be their own legend"
Jayson Tatum in shambles

"Oh so only stars count?  Off the top of my head Jokic didn't miss a single game this year.  Julius Randle missed only 1 game and led the league in minutes played.  Takinf a deep look Book missed just 5 and CP3 missed just 2.  Jayson Tatum missed 8 games, most of which were because of covid.  What about them?  They were fine though.  Also you cannot point at contact injuries and say they're part of it.  Those are really just lightning in the bottle things because what if the ref was like a foot farther away?  What if Capela didn't go for the contest?  Again.  Shit happens in sports.  Part of a season is just being lucky.  Injuries is part of the luck factor."
"Not a nickname, but anytime people say Jayson Tatum is only 19 years old always gets a laugh out of me"

Jayson Tatum
"""Is Jayson Tatum gonna have to choke a bitch?"""
"Tatum is just starting to learn how to play make and isnt that much worse than luka overall rn. Hes more atheltic, stronger, more efficient, better defender, and a better off ball player than luka is. He has more playoff experience too. Tatum has a clearer path to becoming a better player. What else can luka realistically do? Hes already avg a 30pt triple double. Its all a stupidly mute point though cause lukas never being traded and if he is its most definitely wont be for a player basically just as good as him like jayson tatum. The mavs are gonna have to settle for much less."
you know thats not jayson tatum right
It would take them up a bit but I don’t think Brown for Dame gets a ring. The Celtics front office will probably prefer a much longer time frame attempting to build around Jayson and Jaylen. But who knows.   Add Dame to Tatum and Brown it’s more likely. But that’s just not going to happen.
"Aight, this is a fun thread. I’ve got 2 spicy takes:  1.) Jayson Tatum is a legitimate top 10 player who’s season was marred by getting Covid and being on a team with horrible injury and covid luck for the season. If the Celtics had lived up to expectations and JT didn’t lose a month or so due to covid (basically a healthy season) he’d be a consensus top 10.   2.) Luka Doncic is overrated. Luka is a great player and is a joy to watch but his highlight reel doesn’t show his weaknesses. He’s not a very good defender and is an inconsistent shooter. He can get extraordinarily hot at times hitting insane threes but his late clock and clutch stats are not very good. He has a few huge shots to his name that overshadow everything else (that game winning 3 against the clips last year is still nuts).   If you want these hot tales combined I think that Tatum and Luka are at similar levels of play. Luka  is a better passer and Tatum is more efficient scoring and a much better defender. Depending on how you prioritize those will give you an answer to which is better, but it is a legitimate discussion about which of those two. A plug-and-play 2 way wing with some passing chops vs a ball dominant tall point guard that requires an offense built around him."
Jayson Tatum lacks killer instinct confirmed
"League should give All NBA teams by their rank rather than by positions.  This may be an unpopular opinion, but I didn't Julius Randall deserved 2nd Team ALL NBA.   Obviously, he had great stats and help the Knicks make the playoffs, and there arent many all star forwards/PFs in the league.   But the league should give 6th -10th best players in the league the 2nd team ALL NBA rather than by positions. I think players better than Julius Randle got snubbed hard. Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Westbrook, KD, Harden (obviously, some missed significant time but just my opinion)"
I get it sometimes but I just had a super loud song commercial followed directly by Jayson Tatum yelling at me.
"(PPG + ((APG + RPG) x 2)) x 1,000,000 = roughly how much you NBA players are worth if you're a starter level player. All Star/All NBA adds 5 mil.  LeBron = 25 ppg, 7.7 apg, 7.8 rpg in that formula is 37.7 mil. Actual salary is 37.4  Curry = 32, 5.5, 5.8 = 42.65 mil. Actual = $40.23 mil  Derozan = 21.6, 4.2, 6.9 = 29.25 mil. Actual = $27.7 mil  Jayson Tatum = 26.4, 7.4, 4.3 = 37.25 mil. If he had been named All NBA (missed by one spot) his new contract would average roughly that per year  Dennis Schroder = 15.5, 3.5, 5.8 = 20.15 mil. If he signs a 5 year deal he might get $100 mil"
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors — Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats – 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats – 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers’ defenders but couldn’t do much against Simmons.

Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he’s done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he’s kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87. That’s a combined field goal percentage of 29.8."
I'm not 100% sure he's better than Jayson Tatum.
I had the same question about Jayson Tatum with the Celtics. That's just putting yourself on the clock by doing that.
"&gt;Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell in the list of superstars because they are definitely better than AD lol  What the fuck lmao"
Other than Jayson Tatum you mean.  Right?  RIGHT?????   Right.
"I don't think the Celtics would do that trade, but the best way to convince Jayson Tatum to stay with the Boston Celtics beyond his current contract is to win a championship. I think it's much more likely than Celtic fans want to admit that Tatum will leave if they don't win a chip or at least make the Finals by the time his second contract is up.   And the best way to win a championship is by having great players, preferably, generally, 2 of the best 10-15 in the league. Celtics would have that in Dame and Tatum, and unlike Tatum/Brown, there is no redundancy or skill overlap, Dame/Tatum complement each other as a guard/wing do.   All 3 of Kawhi/PG, Tatum/Brown, and Dame/CJ have some diminishing returns to them as duos. All 3 of the Robins (PG, Jaylen, CJ) are better off when you force them into a more prominent role and ask them to do more, and they can kind of disappear and become inconsistent if they aren't in a featured role, even if they aren't good enough for it."
Not sure why The Jayson Tatum is scrolling through Fox News.
celtic fans and low iq.   Hope jayson tatum continues to lead yall to more playoff disappointment year after year

We should definitely do a trade for Kuzma. According to the greatest Instagram fan page of all time (lakersinsider_16) Kuzma has **more potential than Jayson Tatum!**
"Positive takeaways:  -Romeo Langford playing offense (we knew his defense was great already)  -Jabari Parker deserves to be on an NBA roster  -Grant Williams is actually okay at basketball when he gets to play the 5  -a healthy Robert Williams is gonna get a triple double with blocks at some point  -Consistent Effort! For six straight games!  -Jayson Tatum was getting elbowed in the face, poked in the eye, slapped in the head, bear-hugged, and double/triple teamed for 6 play-in/playoff games and averaged 33.8-6.2-4.5-1.2-1.7  Now we let everyone get healthy and come back next season with one of the best wing duos in the league. Let’s go Bruins!"
Lebron “Jayson Tatum” James
Nets just beat Jayson Tatum and the xinjang flying tigers and think they’re hard as fuck lmao
jayson tatum makes every contested three i swear
Did Tatum just block KD....I don’t think people don’t understand how much of a problem Jayson will be once he improves defensively (and he’s pretty decent now as it is)
Jayson Tatum
"Jayson Tatum has been fun to watch, you got a good one there Celtics  Edit: spelling"
"I'm not saying Herro will or won't be good in the future, but remember how over Jayson Tatum everyone was during his 2nd year in the league? The whiplash people always get over rookies is ridiculous. Herro is definitely a promising young player, regardless of how overhyped he got in the playoffs last year."
"Thought about this. I want RJ and Draymond, but I also thought of three other names that might work in this dynamic.  You'd have to screen test personalities as I don't know how the egos mesh.  JJ Redick, CJ McCollum, Joe Ingles. They might all be in the right age range depending on when we lose ITN guys. They all seem like natural media performers (or better, experienced through other formats).  I could see CJ wanting to go down the Aldridge route and wanting to be a reporter though. JJ for Ernie maybe - slightly more edgy due to his white Duke villain past.  Dray already is a Shaq sub somehow, and RJ would be a great Kenny sub. Chuck is hard to replace, but if you replace that southern accent with someone that works (Channing? Jingles? Some sort of Channing Frye/Jayson Tatum hybrid, although Channing Tatum is a ridiculous name for a media performer - it would never happen, right?), maybe?"
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Kevin Durant 7. Trae Young 8. Joel Embiid 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Lebron James 13. Ja Morant 14. Mike Conley 15. Derrick Rose
"We get it, he's your dude, but Ainge and Stevens have been around much longer than Kyrie's stint in Boston and ""toxic"" was never used to describe their team. Brad Stevens especially is a class act through and through.   On the other hand, Kyrie is notoriously difficult, and we have evidence for him calling out young dudes in the media while he was on the Celtics. Imagine how he would have acted directly to them. There were reports he alienated everyone on the team besides Jayson Tatum. If you can't see Kyrie acting above it all and Kyrie-ish and how that would lead to a more difficult work environment, I don't know what to tell you."
As a Nets fan I’m concerned by what I see with this team. Celtics with Jayson Tatum and 3rd stringers got 126 pts on us.   Not saying they can’t figure it out but boy was game 4 concerning. Bucks have stellar offense and great defense. Next round is going to be a battle.
"I would say that Jayson Tatum can be the primary option on a championship contender.  They've made it to 2 ECF with him on the team, both of which he was the primary option during those ECF with.  His defense is very good, and his offense is as well.  He's very skilled in multiple facets on offense.  The team's performance when healthy has been good as well.  He's stepped up his game as needed in the playoffs.  His problem lies more with his team.  The Celtics have not been healthy for any of their runs.  Hayward had been injured or recovering from injury every year on the team. This year, Brown is out for the playoffs, and Smart and Kemba missed significant time during the season.  As for becoming a top 5 player, we need to look at who is above him. Tatum is somewhere in the top 12-18 range now as a player, and yet is only 22 years old.  Assuming health, the ones above him are Lebron (*36*), Curry (*33*), Jokic (*26*), Harden (*31*), Durant (*32*), Luka (*22*), Giannis (*26*), Dame (*30*), Embiid (*27*), AD (*28*), Kawhi (*29*).  5 of those players are 30 or older. 3 of the ones under 30 have consistent injury concerns.  With that in mind, over the next 5 years, I'd only take Jokic, Luka, Giannis over Tatum when building a team. Embiid and AD would also be above him if they remained healthy the majority of the next 5 seasons, which is not a given.  There are other players (Simmons, Zion, Trae, Ja, Brown, and players not yet in the league) that might take a leap into that discussion in they keep improving."
Jayson Tatum confirmed the Aaron Rodgers of the NBA.
He's Deuce because he's Jayson Tatum Jr.
Jayson tatum.... just you wait
You are way more likely to find another Jayson Tatum than Joel Embiid. So build around Joel Embiid
You got any extra wallet size Jayson Tatum photos?
Mans your team lost a game to Jayson Tatum and grant Williams 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Jayson Tatum, dude got me acting strange ngl 😳"
"KDs midrange shooting in 17 was an insane 60%.   In 18 it was 54%, and 19 49%.   In OKC he had years all over the place, some as low as 44%, but also some as high as 54%.   Kawhi as a star scorer didn’t even face OKC, he was always guarding the opposing teams best player, just look at 2017. Even in 2019, he wasn’t guarding Butler the whole time.  Regardless, those San Antonio teams still had MUCH better spacing. And he had an ELITE five out spacing in Toronto. He statistically has the best spacing in the league THIS SEASON as well. Those completely destroy those garbage spacing Thunder teams.   KD is literally clamping Jayson Tatum and averaging 35 for the Nets as we speak as well."
"Did Jayson Tatum specifically say that he was only ranking solely based on skill?   It seems like you are conflating skill rankings with an all time ranking. I think most people take into account many more factors than just skill into their all time rankings  You aren't wrong for thinking the way you do, you should just make the distinction between a specific skill all time ranking and a general all time ranking."
TIL I have a hard time listening to Jayson Tatum
"I have no real evidence or studies to back this up, so forgive me for this point that’s based purely on conjecture — but I feel like the value proposition of the NBA (and sports in general) today is fundamentally different than it was in the past.   When the NBA began, they weren’t competing with much in terms of entertainment. So owners could put out a product that was based more on the team than individual players. But these days, we as consumers have an infinite amount of options that are almost as good as the NBA, and so their leverage for our attention is limited in that regard. That’s just basic economics.   I’m sure people in the past still had their favorite players, but their loyalty was always with the team first and foremost.   Nowadays, it’s flipped for many fans (such as myself). I grew up a Lakers fan, and still cheer for them in most instances. But I’m more of a fan of the league than I am of the Lakers. I don’t stop watching when the Lakers get eliminated. And that’s almost entirely due to the players.   Hell, one of my favorite players in the league is Jayson Tatum. As a Celtic, I should probably hate him. But I don’t. Dude’s just fun to watch, and incredibly impressive at just 23 years old.   The entire reason that NBA owners are in the position that they’re in is that they realize if they pushed the players too far, the players wouldn’t have much trouble finding somewhere else to go (or even starting their own league). And that’s because many (if not most) NBA fans these days watch more for the players than the teams."
"Are you being purposefully ignorant?  Kyrie got on a mic in front of hundreds of Celtics fans verbally committing to re-signing, answering with hostility when asked if that were still true mid-season, undertook a tumultuous stint there, apparently aliented himself from everyone in the locker room except Jayson Tatum, called out his teammates to the media, then dipped after it all.   Then instead of acknowledging that he could've handled all of it better to de-escalate, dude tried to flip the script and basically made it seem like the fans weren't justified in disliking him and played victim rather than just balling out and letting his game do the talking.   That made him even less liked, and now he's just doing openly antagonizing things like stomping on their logo.  You're really comparing Hayward's conduct with Kyries?"

"And yet somehow, even with KD and Kyrie on his team, he dropped a game to Jayson Tatum and the Delaware Blue Coats"
He averaged over 20ppg in Boston too lol. Who were the immensely better players then? 12 year old Jayson Tatum and Guerschon Yabusele?
1 game lol. I’m glad he beat up a team with only Jayson Tatum. WOW!
"Excuse me but if you're not Jayson Tatum or Luka Doncic by year 2, you're obviously a bust and should get ready to play in China.  /s"
You might be right and you might be wrong. There's really no historical support for so the entire thing is speculation and pretty pointless to argue about.   It would be like trying to determine if Damian Lillard + Bradley Beal should be a more successful combo than Damian Lillard + Jayson Tatum.
Well no shit y'all have the Avengers and we have Jayson Tatum and the corpse of Kemba Walker (sometimes)
Fam you guys literally ran him out of town.  Especially your local media who’s doing the same thing with Jayson Tatum right now
Nah man they low key trash. Jayson Tatum was alone out there with legit g leaguers for teammates and we only (I know only lol) lose by 15? And still put 126 on they ass?   Bucks or 76ers will be able to put a muzzle on the nets in a way my Celtics just can’t. We don’t have our second best player and still won a game with a player dropping 50. Like the nets ain’t it mane
"Imagine being the nets, astroturfing your way an all star roster, playing a team of Jayson Tatum and literal rookies, only winning by like 15 points and still talking shit.   UnStoPaBLE man Grant FUCKING williams was guarding durant this game. lets see how they do against a team that isnt completely decimated by injury."
"But the Nets didn’t come out ahead on that trade. The Nets got Pierce and KG. The Celtics got Jaylen and Jayson. The Nets, in an unrelated move, signed Durant and Kyrie and traded for Harden. It’s not like they made savvy moves, they signed dudes bc they’re based in Brooklyn. The Celts drafted Jaylen in 2016 and Tatum in 2017. Consider that the 76ers “process” started by getting Embiid in 2014... you think the Celtics lost the trade?"
"Pascal couldn't score on Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Marcus Smart after not touching a basketball for 6 months  Julius is getting clamped by a 21st ranked defense led by Gallinari and Collins  Julius is far worse LMFAO"
"I feel like Jayson Tatum is basically Billy from Predator. He is going out like a badass, but ultimately getting his ass kicked like a 12 year old would against Jon Jones."
Can we take Kembas 100 million and invest into research for cloning to clone Jayson Tatum ?
"Right now playing we have 2 rookies and 2 players that probably wouldn’t make it onto a China roster, then Jayson Tatum. This man needs help"
Jayson Tatum casually shitting out 30 like nothing with zero help
"Uhhhh we got Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, current 2 best players on the team"
Jayson Tatum will win the 2024 MVP
i know the celtics have other players but this really feels like jayson tatum going 1vX against the mongol army
i swear jayson tatum has to be the most polarizing star in the league. dude can have games like last game where he can drop 50 and it feels like he doesn’t miss anything. then he also has horrible shooting games where he goes like 3-17 and looks awful
the margin for error celtics have is as slim as tatum when he joined the league  love jayson though he's a baller
Jayson Tatum can do no wrong
"Wow this is so fair, 3 top 15 players versus jayson tatum and the future chinese league bench warmers"
"Are you suggesting that a team with Harden, KD, and Kyrie shouldn't lose to Jayson Tatum and the night shift at the TD Garden McDonald's?"
Jayson Tatum would unironically be the best player in the league and the Nets would get an unreal amount of hate
Lol this series sucks. One team is full of bums and the other has Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum
I'm fucking losing it over here.   JAYSON TATUM!!!
"The other one is behind a paywall, but [here's the list.](https://nesn.com/2021/04/espns-top-under-25-nba-list-has-jayson-tatum-behind-lamelo-ball/)"
The Celtics outscored the Heat in last year’s conference finals; the Heat (who play in a state that never shut down athletic facilities for any extended) stretch) kept winning close games by going on runs against the Celtics (who play in a state that locked down so hard that Tatum [went weeks without touching a basketball](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29035905/jayson-tatum-touched-basketball-weeks-says-more-important-things-going-world%3fplatform=amp)) at the end of the 4th when the Celtics were visibly exhausted.
Your team just lost to Jayson Tatum and you’re worried about our 5th best scoring option and his free throw percentage? People on this Sub are weird as hell.
My take away is what Jayson Tatum said about Miami players in the bubble is that they don't play like that normally and we seen that. Where did Robinson and Herro who couldn't miss anything  go this season lol.
Jayson Tatum and Kyrie Irving are doing okay
"In case you still haven't realized, they purposely make these kinda things controversial, and borderline stupid, to get people to talk about them. Their ranking of the top players under 25 was also dogshit. They had Lamelo over Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell lmao."
"You single handedly lost to Jayson Tatum, imagine against a great team like the 76ers."
??  A rookie Jayson Tatum took LeBron to 7 games and got within 8 points of the finals in the 2018 ecf.
Unless you're jayson tatum
"Pretty safe assumption unless Jayson Tatum has a few more 50 burgers. Side note, I’d kill for Jrue on the Celtics."
Correction: Jayson Tatum put up a fight last night
Worry about beating Jayson Tatum and the bum squad first
"Please tell me this man is better than Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum again Heat fans"
Jayson Tatum is the first player to score 50 points while also having the name Jayson Tatum.
I remember being told this man was better than Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown by some people.
Herro is 21 and had a good game 4. Not everybody can be Jayson Tatum
I’ll come back to this after the Nets beat the Celtics. Jayson Tatum ain’t dropping 50 every night hate to break it to you
Are you sleeping on Jayson Tatum?
I have no arguments but of jayson Tatum drop 50 points to save season than Miami can come from a 3-0 hole and win this series.
*except for Jayson Tatum
"but the second coming of  the basketball equivalent of Jesus Christ, Jayson Tatum was"
"Imagine having KD, Harden and Kyrie and losing to Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Tristian Thompson and some dude who's last name is literally a dick disease?"
"Jayson Tatum, the classic case of too good to be a #2 option but not good enough to be a #1 option"

"My center is giving way, my right is retreating, situation excellent, I am attacking.    --Jayson ""Ferdinand Foch"" Tatum"
"Jayson Tatum is the first person with the name ""Jayson Tatum"" to score 50 points in the NBA playoffs. Truly a historic night!"
"Jayson ""DeRulo"" Tatum"
Jayson Tatum giving off big Gohan vibes. When he goes super sayjin he's as good as the best person in the league.
"Curry deserves all the credit more so than KD, because Curry and Draymond were the LEADERS of that team, leadership men’s s a lot outside of the stat line. Also Curry and Kyrie were the last great All star guards to be on the finals, besides Lowry of course who is also a great leader. Before that we have to go back to Tony Parker and Jason Kidd, this goes to show how’s difficult is to make it to the final when led by a small guard as your best player. Nash couldn’t do it, AI almost did. Kobe is a big guard who can play forward, as is Dwayne. This is why Curry and Dame get a pass more so than KD, Lebron, Giannis or Embiid. Also Dame loses series where he is expected to lose, he has also won when he wasn’t suppose to.  The player who doesn’t get enough criticism in my book is Porzingis who has fell off which can be chalked up to injuries, but still. Demand Derozan use to be talked about with Klay, PG and Jimmy. Jimmy redeemed himself from losing that series up 2-0 on the Celtics after rondo got hurt, thanks to his finals run, but now his performance this series another disappointment, even as the underdog. Kawhis leadership in the clutch, as well as James Harden. Russ Westbrook only gets triple double in the regular season has made 1 second round appearance since KD departure. Brandon Brandon Ingram with a third straight season of leading his team to the lottery. Jayson Tatum is #1, Jaylen Brown is second fiddle, that convo is over."
I feel like jayson Tatum falls under the radar as a budding superstar

"we stole a game and Jayson was the only reason while dropping 50, hell of a morale boost going into next season regardless of the series outcome   we need tatum to feel like he’s a top 5 player, I think he thrives when his confidence his boosted (duh) hopefully this core playoff memory motivates him going further"

"not sure how betting works, but watch our injury report and it should be very easy to predict when Jaylen and Jayson are gonna break their career highs.

We have a rookie point guard playing like that, not to mention an all star point guard that is injured, an amazing defensive 2, that is hot or cold from 3, Jaylen freaking Brown, Jayson freaking Tatum, and oh lookie, an average center. I like Tristan and Theis both a lot, but that is by far our biggest weakness.  Their is your rebuttal"
"I’d rather have Jayson Tatum , younger &amp; still improving."
I asked some friends last year and we were split.  Just curious.. Would you guys rather have Jimmy Butler or Jayson Tatum?  I don't think there's a wrong answer.
"Thats not the same situation though. Raptors beating the Sixers wasn't luck and no one would say it is. Raptors beating the Bucks wasn't luck and no one has ever even implied that it was. Raptors beating the Warriors? Yes some luck involved because KD and Klay both got injured. The Heat didn't face an opponent who faced these types of injuries. You can argue Sabonis and Hayward but they're no where near the talent level of KD and Klay. That would be like Celtics losing both Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in the same series.   I still don't see what ""luck"" miami had. Their ""luck"" is that their players played up to the standard that they've been playing most of the season? and the weather?"
Not really. Look at someone like James Harden or Jayson Tatum. Much better off the dribble than they are at moving without the ball.
Jayson Tatum has been 19 for the past seven years
You see it from Jayson Tatum... they just usually don't go in
Jayson Tatum is already top 20 yeah. Evidenced by his All-NBA selection. Booker and Morant aren’t even all-stars
"Jaylen Brown averaged 20.3 PPG, not Gordon Hayward  Kemba Walker averaged 20.4 and Jayson Tatum averaged 23.4"
Celtics did it last year  Jayson Tatum: 23.4 ppg  Kemba Walker: 20.4 ppg  Jaylen Brown: 20.3 ppg  (Honorable mention that almost made it 4 players over 20 ppg)  Gordon Hayward: 17.5 ppg
"Seems foolish to wait to reveal to the world that in a 70 day offseason, Jaylen Brown got better than Jayson Tatum. If you can average 30 as the off ball scorer for 8 games , you can average 30 as the team leader for the rest of your career"
Drafting:   Small Forwards  - Larry Bird  - Hondo  - Paul Pierce  - Gerald Green  - Jaylen Brown  - Jayson Tatum   Recently good in acquiring PGs but small sample size   - Isaiah Thomas  - Kyrie Irving  - Kemba Walker
"Kinda cheating here but the Celtics have a very strong history of small forwards/power forwards. Tommy Heinson, John Havlicek, Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Antoine Walker (kinda), Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and most recently Jayson Tatum."
Celtics  1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Peyton Pritchard 5. Robert Williams 6. Aaron Nesmith 7. Romeo Langford
Me either but I put them there so I wouldn’t get screamed at by Jayson Tatum fanboys
Celtics and small forwards:  John Havlicek  Larry Bird  (Len Bias)  Reggie Lewis  Paul Pierce  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown (probably his natural position)
Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Marcus Smart  Tristan Thompson  Grant Williams  Peyton Pritchard  Kemba Walker
"The Celtics have a great history with Small Forward/wing players.  Havlicek, Cedric Maxwell, Larry Bird, Reggie Lewis (RIP), Paul Pierce and now Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum."
Thanks Jayson Tatum
celtics let by rookie jayson tatum lmao...
"That’s his joke nickname, his real one is 8 Mile as coined by Jayson Tatum"
Jayson Tatum channeling Kobe Bryant on that one.
"I understand what you mean but it doesn’t make much sense. Giannis has the better skills and tools needed to be a first option than Jayson Tatum. You keep saying Jayson Tatum is a better first option but what’s the reasoning behind that? He can’t create for others like a first option needs to be able to. If Giannis was a second option, his biggest strengths of his game are lost."
Jayson Tatum is already a top 5 player in the east but still younger than Buddy Hield at his rookie season.

I want a Jayson Tatum Jaylen Beown beef
I remember when Jayson Tatum vs Pascal Siakam was a debate at one point 😂😂😂
"Yes, Jayson Tatum played sooo amazing. But the young guys really really impressed. Pritchard looked like a fifth year starting point guard. Robert and Grant looked like a front court to be scared of. Semi looked...well...not awful. I still don’t understand the decision to start Tremont, but we won so I guess who cares. Great all around game even if it was against the Raptors."

"If he has anywhere near the Basketball IQ that his father has then even being 6’6 and 210 will be more than enough. I see him growing a lot more though. Look at Jayson Tatum, 22 and grew an inch over the summer. Definitely possible."
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
"I think it’s closer than people are saying just cause Jaylen/Jayson are elite two way players whereas Murray is a liability and Jokic is at best decent. That said rn it’s Jokic/Murray simply because Jokic is putting up MVP numbers but if Tatum takes another step or Jokic declines I think it goes the other way. Imo Murray is becoming a bit overrated based on an admittedly great playoff run, but as of now he’s just really inconsistent."

"Smart and Grant are far from consistent even with wide open looks, especially if it is majority contested. The idiots part was just me in my feelings, but yeah, a Jayson Tatum contested step back three is a better shot then a wide open Grant Williams three imo"
"Jayson has been asked to do more within the offense, over a longer period of time, and has been a consistently better team defender.  This season, Jaylen looks to have taken a real step up in his ability to self create, which wasn't something he really seemed to have in his arsenal as recently as last year. He also seems to be making less glaring lapses with his off ball defense, which was his other gigantic flaw.  As to who is better? Idk. Tatum is still the guy the defense send sthe double at, which probably says nothing. I'm just happy they're both good enough that it's been close this year."
Lmao you aren't doing anything except getting swept again in the first round. Imagine getting swept by Jayson Tatum.
Am I the only guy who thinks Jaylen is more consistent than Jayson Tatum?
I bet it's Jayson Tatum who stole it. They need to waive or trade away this snake RIGHT NOW. Lakers will take him since we are already a hated team.
"&gt; Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert  Those 2 are very good, but I think they are less impactful than Sabonis is, at least in this season so far. Oh and Doncic he will be a super star, but this season he is below Sabonis performance too."
Jayson Tatum is best player in Celtics by miles
A fun game is taking a shot every time they tell you that Jayson Tatum is only 22
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"Blake Griffin? I think he doesn’t look good at all. It just makes me sad watching him play now and seeing the way he moves. He’s lost so much of his fluidity and explosiveness it’s crazy.  My list is KD, Lebron James, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, and Jayson Tatum."

Ah so should the Jazz and Celtics have traded Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum after their all rookie season?
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have both been described as insanely hard workers that are always the first ones in last ones out in the gym. Brad Stevens once told a story about how one day they were still there like an 2 hours after practice ended training and he took a photo for his son of them to show what it takes to be great.
"Jayson Tatum JB Smart  Rob Williams Payton Pritchard  Just cause everyone besides Pritchard we resigned, and Pritchard is probably our best prospect."
Controversial but I believe Jaylen Brown is a better player than Jayson Tatum.   Tatum maybe the better 1-on-1 iso scorer but Brown is the higher impact player and would pair alongside another All Star/ Superstar player a lot more seamlessly.
Jimmy Butler over Jayson Tatum? Are you serious?
Jayson tatum
There's no way Jayson Tatum will be the best player by that time
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
"I’m sure there’s some homer bias mixed with watching him play a ton but I truly believe Jayson Tatum is a top-8 player in the league right now, and by the time he retires will be one of if not the most unstoppable scorer in league history."
"Thanks for the feedback!  &gt; Just seems like a RNG  Technically it is :) but there are patterns in the randomness!  &gt; One year some guy near the bottom of my bench went up 14 points and he like never played.  That kind of thing happens in real life too. Some young players improve while playing very little, and some young players don't improve or even decline despite a lot of playing time. https://basketball-gm.com/faq/#pt explains more, including some evidence.  &gt; Most times, many of my players drop significantly in overall at the age of 28, which I think is strange since everyone claims that's like prime player age and players really only start their decline at 30/31, and for star players, even later.  People may say that, but it doesn't make it true :)  If you look at the data, there are different ways to estimate an NBA career arc, but most look [something like this](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8ylnrt/oc_the_typical_career_arc_of_an_nba_player/), peaking in the mid to late 20s. That doesn't mean players turn 29 and immediately turn to dust. And it doesn't mean that every single player peaks in their mid to late 20s. Just that most players start to gradually decline at that age. BBGM simulates that pretty well I think.  (The age-related thing that BBGM gets wrong currently is very young players. They're worse in BBGM than in real life, but on average they develop faster in BBGM than in real life, so by the time they are like 23 the difference goes away. But this does mean rookies are worse in BBGM than they should be, and drafting is harder.)  &gt; Salaries didn't make sense to me either after the first offseason, a lot of solid players wanted to play/resign for &lt;3 million a year, while rookies were still making 4+ million.   I don't know the specific player that you thought looked funny, so I can't comment on it exactly. But in general the contract stuff is pretty solid. [This explains how it works](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/08/smarter-contract-generation/), but basically contract demands are not just based on how good a player is. It also looks at how much cap space is available and how good the other free agents are. So some years, depending on those factors, the same player might ask for a lot more or less money.  &gt; I started one league and in the first season Jayson Tatum had a higher overall than Embiid, Jokic, Doncic, Durant, Lebron, etc...wish it was true as a Celtics fan lol, but it just wasn't realistic.  There is some randomness in displayed ratings, meant to simulate uncertainty due to scouting. This is probably a stupid idea for stars, since we all have a pretty good idea they are. That explains most of those people Tatum was over for your league.  Also, the 2022 rosters are trying to predict the future, which is hard to do. It'd be surprising if Tatum was the MVP in 2022, but it's not a completely ridiculous thought...  Also, ovr is not everything. The mix of ratings and team context matters too. Some players will overperform or underperform their ovr. Ratings are set more to reproduce stats than to rank players by ovr.  &gt; Orlando seems to always go OP after the first year too since they always sign SGA lol who can't seem to stay on OKC.   BBGM does not have restricted free agency, so a good young player on a horrible team is likely to leave. He doesn't always wind up in Orlando, I just simmed a season and he went to Detroit."
"Played for the first time today for several hours. Had an okay time with it. I feel like potentials and values just don't make much sense to me. I don't understand how they go up or go down. Just seems like a RNG. One year some guy near the bottom of my bench went up 14 points and he like never played. Most times, many of my players drop significantly in overall at the age of 28, which I think is strange since everyone claims that's like prime player age and players really only start their decline at 30/31, and for star players, even later.

I could just be bad with the settings, like I said, this was my first time playing, but those are my thoughts so far. I welcome any help/advice on settings or playing."
Tatum made the ecf in the bubble and had a much better series vs Toronto (and none of his teammates were all star caliber at that point).  But are you legitimately saying that trae young is better than Jayson tatum?

"I just checked out the game for a few minutes and it seems really, really cool. Only thing I'll say is that the trade system seems a little...bugged. I added Bam Adebayo to a trade, pressed ""What would it take to make this trade work?"" and the Heat wanted to give me their entire team for Jayson Tatum.  If there's anywhere I can report bugs or issues, I'll make sure to post there as well."
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Zion Williamson  Trae Young  NEXT 5:  Jayson Tatum  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid  Kevin Durant  James Harden
"The fact people think Damian Lillard is a top 10 player is ridiculous when he has only played 3 great playoff series in his career (2014 first round, 2019 first round, 2021 first round).  Even Russell Westbrook and Paul George are better playoff performers for their careers.  Dame is borderline top 15 tbh and guys like Jayson Tatum and Trae Young have already proved more in the playoffs at this point in their careers."
"First time I saw Tatum play his rookie year was when Boston hosted Washington for their Xmas day game, and I remember watching them interact during shoot around concluding with a clearly-very-tight handshake routine.  It was very surprising to me and I remember looking to see whether or not Beal went to Duke too.  Here’s a (very Celtics-centric) article that was posted the day after that game:  https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2017/12/26/inside-jayson-tatum-evolution-bradley-beal-boston-celtics-washington-wizards-nba-xmas-christmas/"
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9.

To answer your question: I think Jayson Tatum is overrated on this sub
The issue with these lists is that they rarely account for draft picks past the year they were made. I guarantee the author of this list had no idea who guys like Luka Doncic or Jayson Tatum were. They just assume that everyone who was good will still be good and some of the most recent draft picks will be good.
*Jayson Tatum
"Lebron   KD  Giannis  Steph  Harden  Kawhi  Luka Donic  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum   For 14/15 I could care less  I just think that you’re comment about him needing to be top 5 when healthy to be top 15 is complete bs, if I read it right.  If we’re considering Kyrie a PG and James an SG now I hold heartedly believe Kyrie is probably the best SG in the league (yes over Bradley Beal)  He had an absolutely amazing season this year, 9 in points per game, 11th in PER, and is the 9th player to make the 50/40/90 club, he also was having a good playoff run before he went down, and yes I do think Nets take the chip if Kyrie is healthy.  The Nets are a top heavy team that prides themselves on having 3 players who can go off at any moment and are borderline unstoppable when they do, I’ve seen you say it’s best they trade Kyrie, and no offense, that’s BS too.  There aren’t 15 players in the nba better than Kyrie"
"Jayson Tatum is better???? Lmfaooooooooooooooo. Also, this is like the 100th post i’ve seen on this sub being like “dame is so overrated”, so how overrated can he be? no way you started watching the NBA pre-2015"
Saying dame is better than jayson Tatum is actually debatable and I would take him over Tatum.
"Lilliard, Luka, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Brad Beal, Rudy Gobert.  Kyrie’s game is visually stunning, but I dock him for consistently and repeatedly missing games every season. Being able to be on the court and help your team is a pretty important factor in your overall value."
the swap was a last minute add on.  the pick that ended up conveying Jayson Tatum was a last minute add on.  every time JT does something sexy on the court I pray to Billy King.
Because Jayson Tatum said he would trade himself for AD?
Breaking: Jayson Tatum Says The MeToo Movement Not As Important As Anthony Davis
"“I ain't gon' say no names but there was some people on the other team, I'm like hold on, he don't normally play like that. Like he acting different in the bubble.”   -Jayson Tatum"
"One, DEATH ISN'T THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF COVID, HOLY FUCK DOES THIS STILL NEED TO BE EXPLAINED?  Covid can fuck you up, even if it doesn't kill you.  KAT lost 50 pounds due to covid, Jayson Tatum needed to use an inhaler for all of last season, and Christian Wood and Russell Westbrook both got smacked around by it.  Also, just because they can't die from it, doesn't mean they can't spread it to people that will. Just one example: There was a wedding in Vermont that, as a result, killed three people due to covid spreading. None of those three people attended the wedding.  And two:  &gt; instead of older white people  It's killing more minorities than white people! This has been a talking point for months!  &gt; And I say that as someone who’s been vaccinated  Being vaccinated doesn't mean you know a damn thing."
"I specifically said he is not as thin as Curry who is 185lbs and is the perfect example of average athletic build....and he is not as big as Lebron. Clearly there is a 40-50lbs weight difference and it's not all height, there are other 6'8"" players that are much lighter than Bron like PG-13 for example or Jayson Tatum.   If anything he looks like a smaller Giannis, muscular but a little thinner not massive. I remember seeing a jersey swap last season and Westbrook is jacked, just a little smaller, whereas Lebron has thicker less defined muscular build.    Westbrook has been my favorite NBA player since he entered the league, not trying to disrespect."
"""The way their portraying this statement is blasphemous, an embarrassment to the league, and quiet frankly I'm appalled that their intentionally blowing this out of proportion, I know Jayson Tatum and Jalen on a personal level I use to babysit these boys and let me tell you that the fact of the matter is they are both Batmans I watched them play make believe at a young age and agreed that they would take turns saving Gotham.""  -Steven A Smith"
"If it's local law, they need to abide by it is the simple answer.   The other answer is.. Jayson Tatum. He got covid and is a young nba superstar and it hit him hard. I think he was just starting to recover at the end of the year. He doesn't have to die.. thats 50 games that were impacted by him being out or just sub par.  The nba doesn't want to have any more of that or even take the chance.  Also, the vaccine greatly reduced the odds of getting covid. Not 100 percent but a good amount. And that could mean the difference of tons of players not getting sick at all vs...several."
Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.
"Only a dumbass like you would think that drafting Jayson Tatum was a bad move. Again I say, Celtics fans are really fucking stupid."
"Because if you are vaccinated, even though the vaccine isn’t 100% effective (but still amazingly effective)  then three important things are true:  You are less likely to contract it in the first place   You are less likely to spread it to others if you do happen to catch it  If you do happen to catch it you are much less likely to experience severe symptoms (yes the players are in great shape but look at what happened to Jayson Tatum last year, symptoms can persist for a long time even in elite athletes)   This is important because the harder it is to catch and spread disease among players the less likely the NBA will have to cancel games or hold players out with covid issues"
Here is my top 20 list  1. KD 2. Giannis 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lemickey 5. Steph Curry 6. James Harden 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Luka Doncic 9. Dame Lillard 10. AD 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Jayson Tatum 13. Trae Young 14. D Booker 15. CP3 16. Paul George 17. Jimmy Butler 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. Joel Emfatass 20. Karl Anthony towns
"Jokic hasn't made it to the finals because there's no feasible 2nd option on that team. Unless MPJ can stay consistent as a 2nd option behind Murray. Until every other team in the NBA goes cold shooting threes and quits playing iso ball with pick and role elements, a team with a slow skilled big man as their first or second option can't make it to the finals, and if they do, injuries gave them favorable match ups. Argue  your feelings all you want but analytics and just watching basketball proves the point. Teams will let Jokic and Embiid play MVP caliber regular seasons, cause it's the regular season. All you're playing for is as much of a home court advantage as you can get. No one in their right mind would pick Jokic and his MVP season or Embiid over say KD, LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, Jayson Tatum, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Klay, Irving and James Harden. All those guys have proved they can play efficient highscoring games and work well playing Iso ball and running the pick and roll."
Doc Rivers Hate Boston Celtic superstar Jayson Tatum - ESPN probably
"RIP Inhaler Tatum, welcome Working Lung Jayson"
2016: Ingram to Jaylen Brown 2017: Ball to Jayson Tatum Too lazy to look up the rest lol
Reminds me of the Jayson Tatum classic: “I’d trade me for Anthony Davis”
Holy shit.  [Elite athletes literally aren't immune from the effects at all.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/3/3/22292213/athletes-covid-recovery-stories-jayson-tatum-mo-bamba-asia-durr)  You literally just watched an NBA season last year that demonstrated players / teams who came back from positive tests had conditioning/breathing issues.   How do you say something like that with a straight face given the very obvious observations and results available.
"I like MPJ and think he will be a multiple time all star and star. Still 41 million should be for top 5 players and if it’s an clerk at should be for guys like Devin Booker, KAT, or Jayson Tatum. I don’t even think he can make the all star team this season.   Even if he is a great player, I don’t know if he can ever come close to 41 million. Maybe 30-35, but this is a huge risk and I don’t think he can come close to his full contract which is understandable, but this is going to be a lot on pressure on him to perform."
2016 - Jaylen Brown for Dragan Bender  2017 - Jayson Tatum for Josh Jackson  2018 - Robert Williams for Jacob Evans   Fucking yikes.
I agree Kareem  Dudes out here really don’t get how serious covid is. How many times have KAT and Dame talked about what it’s done to them and their families? Jayson Tatum gotta use an inhaler now.   Wasting all the time in the world to show why they’re uneducated when they could simply go and get it in minutes.
"1. And? Guys like Josh Richardson, Jrue Holiday and Jayson Tatum were extremely affected. It affects different people differently so what’s your point ?  2. No the problem is with anti vaxxers for putting other people at risk out of sheer ignorance. Also the reason kids under 12 cant get it is due to safety... research is still being done to figure out the affects/ dosages for children. You realize vaccines have different affects on different age groups and science requires time to study right ?  3. No, cities making the choice illegal are prioritizing safety. I’m mad at the people refusing to follow that law. And again the fact is the law is in place... so it’s their choice that’s preventing them from playing and helping their team regardless of how you try to spin it.  4. My problem is with employees refusing to adhere to the rules of the business they work for. Everyone has a choice and those choices have consequences. It’s that simple. If you don’t want to get vaccinated, then don’t. But you can’t proceed to bitch about the consequences of it.  5. I have the same reaction when players do thinks that put other people at risk, like assault.  6. The same logic applies either way..."

"Lottery pick team for the last 10 years who made it further than your team’s core + 3 allstars who all left after your team failed to be as successful😂 all those shitty years and horrible draft picks and we still peaked higher than yall, tough. Can’t wait to see Jayson Tatum make it as far as DBook once he leaves that shit city"
"**Should be locks:**   Paul George  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Trae Young  Karl-Anthony Towns  **I Would Take:**  Chris Paul   Rudy Gobert  Bradley Beal   &amp;#x200B;  Zion, Mitchell, Booker, Lavine all have strong arguments over those 3 at the end. I think Middleton, Bam, and Westbrook are comfortably the bottom 3 for me. They are great players, but I wouldn't actually want any of those guys as my best player if I'm trying to make the playoffs - and with Bam and Westbrook they have definite flaws that can be exploited."
"Actually defensive stats make him look good, but like you said they’re notoriously bad.  He is covered on defense by Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum and they make him look good.  If you watch him, he loses his man, can’t get past screens, gets bullied even without a mismatch, doesn’t contest shots and doesn’t help well.  I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but he was a borderline all star at his best and was never a good defender, now he’s getting older."
"You would think he would get it after seeing his good friend  Jayson Tatum get absolutely wrecked by covid at age 23, but unfortunately not. UF has a great medical program too. Such a shame."
"I literally typed in because of his free throws and because he jacked up more threes and you ignored the second part so you could argue.  He shows up as a decent defender on stats because he had Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum covering him lol.  He fails the eye test miserably.  He can’t contest shots and doesn’t make it around screens and is constantly bullied on ball.  Marreese Speights led the league in charges for us off the bench and he was an awful defender.  People who go out of their way to take charges do it because they can’t otherwise play meaningful defense."
"Bruh this shit takes like 30min. Go in to the vaccine place, wait for X amount of minutes, get your shot, wait 15min to leave, and boom done.   How has he not looked at former teammate Jayson Tatum who had a battle with covid who has to use an inhaler now.  How has he not seen how it’s effected KAT and his family and think “I’m still not getting this vaccine”.   Dudes just dumb as rocks and self centered."
[Moore] Eye test here at Media Day says Jayson Tatum is definitely much younger than he was last season. Just reaching 6’10. - Tatum had said he had de-aged to 18 over the offseason
"I guess no one's told you about this guy, his name is Jayson Tatum he dropped 50 like three times in a month with a 60 point game as well. I like Fox and have always had him over lonzo but at the end of the day the most valuable players are wings. just look at the past FMVP's. it's all wings, with Giannis being debatable. all about the wings"

"Trae will have more career success than Luka early on, then Luka will go to the Hawks in free agency 2025 to team up with him. They’ll make the finals but lose to a tough Nuggets team led by Nikola Jokic, who gets his first ring and has an alltime great playoff performance where he knocks off a solid Blazers team, the prior year champion Lakers, and an on the rise OKC team led by young studs Emoni Bates, Josh Giddey, and Amari George. Luka and Trae then proceed to win the next two finals, but fail to threepeat due to the poetic basketball of the Warriors which serves as the last hurrah for Steph, Klay, and Draymond but is a coming out party for young stud Jordan Walsh. Luka then returns to the Mavs, forming an intense rivalry with the Celtics who have added walking mismatch and former MVP Zion Williamson to their already all-NBA core of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Bob Williams. The Mavs somehow triumph against the Celtics in Luka’s second year back, making him a Dallas legend. After a few years, he goes to the Lakers where he wins another chip and cements himself as a potential GOAT. By this point, Trae has retired largely due to recurring ankle injuries but is considered a top 10 PG of all time."
"Notable Players in their Age 22 seasons :  - Kawhi Leonard: 12.8/6.2/2.0 60.2 TS%  - Kevin Durant: 27.7/6.8/2.7 on 59.8 TS%  - Paul Pierce: 19.5/5.4/3.0 on 55.0 TS%  - Dirk Nowitzki: 21.8/9.2/2.1 on 60.1 TS%  - Kobe Bryant: 28.5/5.9/5.0 on 55.2 TS%  - Paul George: 17.4/7.6/4.1 on 53.1 TS%  - James Harden’s 1st year in Houston: 25.9/4.9/5.9 on 60 TS%  - Tracy McGrady: 25.6/7.9/5.3 on 53.2 TS%  - Anthony Davis: 24.3/10.3/1.9 on 55.9 TS%  - Jayson Tatum: 26.4/7.4/4.3 on 57.6 TS%  There’s more examples but you get the point. I’m not saying he’s going to be the next LeBron James, but to say he will NEVER be a superstar with how good he is already seems unfair."
Jayson Tatum is currently at his peak and will plateau the rest of his career. Much like PG. After about 4 years in he was who he was.
Either Jayson Tatum from Boston or James Harden from Nets
Jayson Tatum
"Yes im sure the Rockets, Pelicans, etc. fans were ecstatic when their superstars demanded trades......I hope Jayson Tatum demands a trade after resigning, I'm sure you will be happy for him"
"Least favorite team? Gotta be the Celtics.  Jayson Tatum is already a problem, but he's going to be an even bigger problem in a few years."
It’s honestly a toss up between Jayson Tatum and Jimmy Butler.
I’m such a huge fan of Jayson Tatum it’s ridiculous
The demise of Jayson Tatum was greatly exaggerated.
Jayson Tatum is out there somewhere looking up the record for most FGA in a game.
Is Jayson tatum on the wolves?
Lol yes Jayson Tatum has started off bad. He'll be fine idk why I keep seeing Celtics fans panic like he turned into a bum overnight.
Jayson “my parents added an extra letter” tatum
Oh yea? Ill raise you a jayson tatum
"yeah as a Michigan alum who watched both of his seasons there, in his second year he started having these games where he would just take over and completely control the flow of the game with his (usually off-ball) defense. it felt like he was everywhere and would get a hand on everything.   he reminded me a lot of pre-COVID Jayson Tatum sometimes, just a really smart and long wing defender who is in the right place to make a play. really love that he’s looked good for the Magic, they seem like a lot of fun even if they’re still growing"
We need Marcus Smart vs Jayson Tatum

I'll take Jayson Tatum playing like garbage if it gets us 20+ min of Aaron and Romeo
Last time I heard Jayson Tatum was 17 so that would be a 14 year age difference. Tons of time to improve tbh.
"Idk if I ever get a guys twitter like jayson tatum or someone im definitely liking a tweet that says ""Tatum has to take 30 shots a game because no one else on the C's can shoot"" and then logging out.  Tatum catch heat for that for the rest of his life and no one will believe he got hacked lol"
"Since Jayson Tatum entered the NBA in 2017-18, the Jays have more playoff wins than 28 out of 30 NBA teams. Only the Bucks and Warriors have more. But sure Heros better LMAO. Last week it was Bam, Who will it be next week? Butler. Stop rocking a Celtics flair dude we all know you're not a fan"

This 8 game season is the only season Jaylen has actually been better than Jayson."

Jayson Tatum making me vomit in my mouth
"I just wanted to point out that while it's fine that Brown is making less than the max per year, it might not be ideal that they only signed him to 4 years instead of 5, as he'll be a free agent a year earlier (he's in the second year of that 4 year deal). Jayson Tatum as well has a player option on his 5 year deal so these guys are each only locked up for 4 years instead of 5. That's totally fine if they plan to re-sign without hesitation, but considering how things went last year and are going this year, Boston may have to start to worry that they might want out if things don't change soon. I'm guessing the last thing Boston wants is to be worrying about the free agency of Jaylen Brown.  Also, the money saved by getting Brown for a little less than the max really just saves the owners money, rather than helping to create cap flexibility, because Boston is so far over the cap anyway, so there's no real extra opportunity created with that savings. It would probably give Brown slightly higher trade value if Boston looked to move him though."
Lmao all you need is a playmaker Point guard that will set the pace and keep the ball moving.  Extra plus if that PG is a lockerroom leader and great teammate  I literally just described Ricky Rubio  Teams tank for a Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum.. the notion that you have to trade 1 because they are really good but the team sucks is just stupid. It’s not a Ben Simmons situation where he sucks and that affected the team
Jayson “Chucker” Tatum  Jaylen “Tunnel Vision” Brown  Marcus “Not” Smart
Most isolation shots ... Jayson Tatum  I actually have no idea but based on him getting ripped last 24hrs I'm going with him
"so the guy is All Star caliber but won't be one because his team is shite, he's going to have to absorb A TON of losing which cannot be good for the mental of a competitive player, if he plays too well and they win too much Mr Pick Stockpiler will likely shut him down for the rest of the season in pursuit of the best lottery odds. there's even the chance he spends the next 2-3 years losing a bunch of games then getting shipped out if the next big thing is drafted by the Thunder and Presti changes course.  nothing in this league is guaranteed, he could fall off a cliff production-wise in a year or two, pick up a serious injury or just be an also-ran in a star PG-heavy Western Conference pecking order. fact is, he's BALLIN' RIGHT NOW. Luka, Trae, Ja aren't in their ""prime"" years and they're either already All Stars or about to be in Ja's case. tell me that doesn't matter. Jayson Tatum has been overhyped because he's a nice player playing for a marquee franchise with yearly title expectations. Shai is a nice player playing in basketball Siberia atm"
She interviewed Jayson Tatum a couple of years ago and he was struggling holding eye contact lmao https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sY5KDoNhNR0
Jayson Tatum for Ben Simmons trade incoming.
"the boston celtics better keep Jayson tatum and Brown, they both reek of hog."
Isn’t jayson Tatum like 17 tho? Lot of time to grow
"The ball can be passed more than one time. It’s not like whoever they pass it too has to take a shot. Pass move around and someone will get open, he’ll maybe even jayson Tatum"
"Yes.. if you make KD shorter and worse at basketball, you get Jayson Tatum"
if he's such a good defender why did Jayson Tatum let Devin Booker drop 70 on him 🤔
"I get ya. It’s not about motivating the team. It’s about venting your frustration and you never think you are gonna act like that until you become that frustrated and you become that frustrated when you feel like you are being treated poorly as a fan for a long period of time. Our guys aren’t fired up over bad losses like Draymond would be and Marcus Smart ain’t good enough to pull that and it has been a lot of passion-less excuses for a while now. The losses and bad play don’t seem to bother our guys and they seem pretty relaxed about it. So what do you do as a fan after that? If Jayson Tatum were as fired up about bad losses as he was about not getting calls when he isn’t finishing around the rim and come out the next game with a chip on his shoulder, there wouldn’t be a need to boo. But that currently isn’t happening in Boston."
"I guess that's what happens when your entire offense seems based around iso and no players can actually score in iso  jayson tatum is not kevin durant, but apparently someone needs to tell him that"
"Jayson ""The Settler"" Tatum"
They'll have 2: Jayson Tatum and CJ McCollum
clearly someone needs to save Jayson from this.   The wizards will offer the celtics bertans and deni avdija... who says no?  can't believe anyone would try to stop Tatum from coming to the wizards... he's desperate to join his best friend in DC
"This team biggest issue is they have no identity or an outside of Jaylen and Jayson hit some shots and they're bad shots. And when the offense isn't going well, they give up on defense with Tatum by far being the worst that's why we give up buckets in transition and off of perimeter offensive boards."
IMO the Spurs' loss against the Celtics where Jayson Tatum dropped 60 was worse.
I feel as though the Celtics have been the same team since Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum have been on the team. They need a new view. Boston is not it. Blow it up and rebuild!
"Yeah into traffic. Especially Tatum. Who on the Celtic Roster am I respecting from 3? Jaylen, Jayson( who's been struggling), Al sure but as a 5 not a 4."
[More like not enough](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kobe-bryant-and-jayson-tatum-average-assists)
Tell me again why I’m supposed to believe that Jayson Tatum is this super awesome complete player.
"Surely some of this has to come down to the organization bleeding talent since that series right? They went from Younger Horford Kyrie Hayward to Theis Kemba Hayward to Older Horford Schroder Josh Richardson. Sure some of the young guys have come along during that time and Tatum and Brown have grown, but it's tough to maintain a high level of performance when you have key pieces leaving every season and your talent keeps downgrading. I don't think I'm being a super biased fan when I say the Raps have one of the best FOs in the league and even they couldn't avoid bottoming out for a season after losing Kawhi, Danny, Marc, and Serge. It's hard to replace top level talent.  I'm not saying that the roster with Kyrie was a good fit chemistry wise, or that the 2020 playoff roster with Kemba and Hayward didn't have its flaws and injury struggles, I'm just saying those groups were deeper and more talented around Jayson and Jaylen, and that counts for something too."
"I've been hearing this logic for over a year now. Timelines DO NOT MATTER in the NBA. Championship windows are extremely small and most often these ""solid"" teams end up accomplishing nothing. Do you think you will ever win a championship with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown as your two best players? The answer is NO, but since they ""fit the timeline"" apparently it's okay. If your team had traded Brown for Harden back when he first asked for a trade you'd never be in this situation."
"Right now, they’ve compounded roster construction issues with a front office overhaul and a change to a rookie head coach. It’s the perfect storm for early season drama.  Over the past couple of seasons, there have been issues with player accountability. Stevens is, at the very least, complicit on this end; at worst, he’s its driving force. They’ve also failed to capitalize on the last couple of drafts, missing out on guys like Bey, Bane, and Anthony in favor of players who haven’t panned out as well. Hard to tell if it’s a drafting issue or a player development issue.  Jayson Tatum getting COVID two seasons ago, just as he was going on a tear, is also a huge blow. By all accounts, he’s never felt the same since. Even lowering his outlook from an A+ to an A- has huge consequences.  On Reddit, their problem is a bunch of people who don’t watch their games giving their opinions, but that’s how it’s always worked.  Personally, I’ve divested emotionally from this team entirely. They could win the fucking title this year and I don’t know if I’d care."
"Boston isn't my team but I've noticed right away, since his rookie year, that Jayson Tatum has been a super ball hog. Once you pass him the ball, he doesn't ever give it back out."
"meh dude formed a roster of  kyrie irving, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, gordon hayward, al horford, terry rozier, and marcus morris  thats a really fucking good team. like.. really good lol.   but got hit with basically worst case scenario and then the celtics were too content with not making moves after it fell apart  while he made mistakes, he did legitimately form an amazing team in 2018. just unfortunate that it didnt work out"
Jayson Tatum style of play
"No doubt, I'm just saying even a young Kobe would dominate this league way more than the guys he's compared to (Tatum, Book) but an experienced 28-29 yo Kobe would own the fuckin league.  The people on this sub don't know any basketball when they compare Jayson Fuckin Tatum to Kobe"
Ben Simmons for Jayson Tatum or Jalen Brown
"Are you fucking high? We're suppose to suck Kyrie's dick because he scored more points than sophomore Jayson Tatum and the injury ravaged Gordon Hayward? You do know that Kyrie shot 36% from the field that series, right?"
Jayson Tatum spent too long watching Kevin Durant highlights and has convinced himself that he can also shoot 50%+ on contested jumpers.
Lmao yeah the mighty all NBA Jayson Tatum is just giving the rest of the east a good head start to keep it interesting
"Jayson Tatum is working/has to work too damn hard to get a shot -- that's not good long or short term."
"Jayson ""the settler"" Tatum"
"Yeah, I'd say Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown would be a fair trade"
I think if nesmith can develop properly he's the key. nesmith/jaylen/jayson/al/timelord (with tatum playing point forward) is an elite lineup.
"I admit, I'm much higher on LaVine, and lower on Tatum than most so keep that in mind.  PG &gt; Butler &gt; LaVine &gt; Tatum &gt; Booker &gt; Beal &gt; Mitchell &gt; Morant (although Ja he keeps this up, he'll leapfrog some players on this list)  EDIT: [LaVine vs Tatum stats over this &amp; last season](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1=lavinza01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;p1yrto=2022&amp;player_id2=tatumja01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021&amp;p2yrto=2022). LaVine was on a much, much worse team than Jayson which is why he didn't get the recognition he deserves. This is one of the reasons why I'm SO stoked that the Bulls are actually good this year."
"Complacency mostly.  For management as well as the main guys (Tatum, Brown, Smart). I think because they achieved  success relatively easily early on they just think that everything will come easy.  Likewise for management who think just because we’re the Celtics, surely we’ll get into the Playoffs and maybe another conference finals and this have opted not to make significant moves.  Jaylen, Jayson &amp; Smart haven’t bothered to play defense at a competitive level ever since the bubble and it shows up in flashes.   We’ve also had bad luck with Free Agent signings/trades as of late. Good moves on paper that never panned out on the court.  All that coupled with the East getting much better (namely Knicks, Hawks, Nets, Bulls etc) puts us at a 6-8 seed level at the moment.  Oh and lack of leadership, but hopefully that improves with Big Al."
"jayson ""the settler"" tatum is blasting more 3's than ever."
"Jayson Tatum - ISO scoring  Jaylen Brown - defense, his off-ball defense is particularly infuriating  Marcus Smart - similar to Jaylen, his off-ball defense is infuriating, except for a different reason, Jaylen's tendency is to fall asleep off ball, Smart over helps when he doesn't need to. And obviously his shot selection is not the best, not necessarily due to the shots he takes, but *when* he decides to take them. That's something I'm still hoping he can improve but I'm getting less optimistic as the years go by.  In general, this core always shits the bed in close games due to terrible execution of half-court offense."
"Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and ........ Dennis Schroder???"
The Celtics aren't on shit. And Jayson Tatum is closer to the Devin Booker/Trae Young tier than Jimmy Butler and Paul George  Zion's gonna come back healthy and make a big mid-season push for the Pels.  Cam Reddish is going to establish himself as the 3rd best player from his class.  The Bulls are going to run through the regular season but get trounced in the 1st round.
You missed Fredderick Edmund VanVleet Sr. and Jayson Christopher Tatum Sr.
Jayson Tatum is shooting 40% FG 27% 3PT he will get those up in a week.
&gt; they don’t exactly have the best deep threats either.  Jayson Tatum averaged 38.6% and 40.3% from 3 the last 2 seasons. Jaylen Brown 39.7% and 38.2%. That's pretty good especially for the volume they take

For who though?  Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are just the perfect timeline together. Anyone you trade Brown for (since Tatum is a superstar and definitely the better player) would just shorten that window of contention or be too young to win in 1-2 years.
"The Celtics need a new coach . Holy shit , this is bad and Jayson Tatum needs to get traded to another team ."
He has a point though. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum is just not a good duo
"Jayson Tatum is not that guy, trust me."
Counterpoint - Jayson Tatum
"The data is currently adjusted to total jump balls, which would be a better threshold for sample size. Otherwise, you got guys like Jayson Tatum, Michael Porter Jr., and Rudy Gay who all have 100% jump ball win percentage despite playing 60+ games each. They only have 3, 2, and 6 jumps respectively compared to the 40 minimum for the players presented."
Isn’t jayson Tatum still an infant too lol we’re so fuccin funny
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Ja Morant 5. Nikola Jokic 6. Rudy Gobert 7. Anthony Davis 8. Miles Bridges 9. Jayson Tatum 10. Trae Young
"Seriously. How many times can you roll the dice without something catastrophic happening? That’s outside of any long term health issues. Jayson Tatum shouldn’t need an inhaler to compete in a NBA game in his early/mid 20’s.   They also played in empty arenas, with limited contact  outside of the court. The league and these cities want to get back to business as usual. That means full crowds, media, and other league endeavors that generate income. These mandates in cities help to make that happen more safely"

Imagine if Bryan Colangelo wasn't an nepotism case and was instead a good GM and drafted Jayson Tatum instead of Markelle Fultz.
"Not all, but some Lakers fans have the worst takes ever.

How are you still arguing for Jayson Tatum?  I agree with you.  As does everyone
You’re making an argument of Terrance Mann vs. Jayson Tatum.  It’s no contest
He’s older than Jayson Tatum.
We got that player eventually in Maxey so it's all good (except we could have had Jayson Tatum too).
Imagine this team plus Jayson Tatum
"But Kemba fit them so well, right? I don't understand Boston Celtics. Basically this makes me think that Jayson Tatum is on his way out. Gonna partner up with more super stars as if he didn't have enough already."
Everytime I watch Philly play I cant help but think how crazy it is that they could have had Jayson Tatum on this team.
Last year we sweeped them without Gordon Hayward and with younger (and much worse) Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum  The two this season are completely different players.
"Cause we’d of had to trade Jayson or Jaylen, that’s fucking stupid. Jayson Tatum is more valuable today than Jimmy, PG13, AD and however many other guys we were rumored to trade him for  It’s called playing the long game and it’s worked out swimmingly"
He needs an elite ball handler like Jayson Tatum

"Green teamers working overtime to defend Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum and (most importantly) Jaylen Brown from all criticisms by scapegoating Kemba Walker, as if he was single-handedly holding the team back.  It's disturbing what is happening in Boston. People deify three people who have achieved nothing in comparison to other Boston sports teams. Tatum redeemded himself a bit but I respect guys like JBJ and Bergeron way more than the trio of Stevens/Tatum/Brown."

"I actually really like this for both teams  Kemba's contract is much bigger and prohibiting Boston from making decent trades with him at the moment as his deal expires in 2 years and he has tanked his value as a playoff starter  He also has creates a lot of redundancy with Boston's offensive scheme which isn't great in this context, as Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum should be the primary playmakers for that team. Kemba was just offering average to sub par 3 point shooting and defense at that position while also bringing below-average knees (he missed a ton of games for Celtics, who ultimately could have benefitted from a 1-2 seed bump to make a deeper playoff run)  On top of this, Boston has been desperate for rebounding and shot blocking. Horford has been great in the paint most of his career and Moses Brown is a promising defensive center, so they are replacing a negative asset  doing something they don't need with two that have much more upside, given that all they have to do is help reduce Tristan Thompson's minutes  OKC gets picks and a ball handler to drive the tank"
"&gt;Of course Kemba is better but his contract is awful and it makes more sense to move him now rather than punt 2 years of Jaylen and Jayson.  How does this change the whole ""punting 2 yrs of Jaylen and Tatum"" part?   Both Horford and Kemba have 2 yrs left on their contracts.   Kemba is due $36 and $37 mil the next 2 yrs   Horford is due $27 mil and he has a $14 mil non gtd option for 2023 so you either keep him or get rid of him and pay him $14 mil.   What is creating this cap space for 2023 gonna meaningfully change if Jaylen and Tatum are on max contracts, Smart is under contract and they keep Fournier. Not like they are suddenly now in position to sign some massive FA in the summer of 2023(if they would even chose Boston) because of this trade. All it's doing is making sure that ownership can avoid the tax easier."
"There were significantly less flu hospitalizations this past year too. Because when you take measures, it stops the spread of diseases  I also get really annoyed when people look at it as just two alternatives- life or death. Many people had side effects for months and some still have side effects. I've talked to multiple people with various effects still happening months later. Jayson Tatum had to start using an inhaler when he had never used one before. People can't seem to comprehend that the two outcomes aren't just ""healthy or death"""
Someone told him the nets were the bone headed franchise that gave the Celtics the draft picks that landed them jaylen brown and jayson tatum
"Jayson ""John McCain"" Tatum"
"Eh, to be fair that take was much more of a pushback on the Jayson Tatum will be a top 5 guy next year level craziness than saying he was bad. And his perception had some merit, the dude isn’t a creator and that was kind of exposed this year when Kemba was ineffective.   But yeah, that dude was clearly in love with himself."
jayson tatum
If he goes to the Celtics I'll start saying that Norman Powell is better than Jayson Tatum
"Dame, Jayson Tatum, Trae, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler"
Cough Jayson Tatum cough
They’re worth a lot but teams aren’t moving on from future (or current) superstars that have half a decade of team control left. Like Jayson Tatum could tell the Celtics he wants a trade and take a steaming dump on Brad Stevens’ desk and I’m like 60-70% confident he’d still play for the Celtics after that
"Bit of a weird one but I can see it being Jayson Tatum, he went really far in the playoffs in his first seasons, give him two or three disappointing series' and people might clown him"
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  You bucks fans are delusional
Hm. But whenever someone gets into an argument with y’all it’s “17 championships LMAOOO” how old is jayson Tatum? 21?  It’s sort of like Cowboys fans complaining. 5 championships and ur still focused on the bad. Lol
How is losing to LeBron fucking James when your best players are al Hortford and a rookie Jayson Tatum getting out coached? Yall are wild.
"that's why there are 20+ dudes in the NBA making more than Jordan ever did in a season. lol I'm pretty sure Jayson Tatum makes more Ina  year than Oscar Robertson made in his career. that's not because Tatum is better in relation to the league than Oscar was, it's because there are so many more eyes and wallets focused on the NBA, and without those eyes and wallets, Tatum is making 20k a year working a second job the dudes in the 50s did."
"Ready to get downvoted, but I'd take him over Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, and maybe Westbrook."
"That's nothing, Jayson Tatum is only 15"
Jayson Tatum is overrated

Celtics Anti-Cops coalition 🤝 how do you do fellow Jayson Tatum enjoyer
"I mean I don’t think everything changes though. I just think that on an NBA floor Cade will look and play more like Jaylen Brown than Jayson Tatum.  Also Jaylen isn’t an upside comp. It’s a play style comp. There’s a chance he can be better than Jaylen, it’s unlikely, but there’s a chance."
"I mean him being 2 inches shorter than he says certainly changes his role. I get that you’re a Pistons fan but it’s delusional to think that his height being 2 inches shorter than it really is doesn’t matter in any way.   To me his comp goes from Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic to Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown.   That’s not a bad thing, those two players are amazing, they just aren’t as amazing as the freaks of nature that are Jayson and Luka."
Jayson Tatum did this just this year
Easy to feel old in the presence of literal teenager Jayson Tatum.
Jayson Tatum will become an MVP level talent and a consensus top 10 player. Hes already knocking on the door.
"Jayson Tatum.  Dude just put up the ninth most points in an Olympic run since like 1988, and it was on amazing efficiency. Not to mention he is an elite defender. He was the second best player behind the best player in the league. His scoring was just as elite even with FIBA rules and less foul calls where you saw guys line Dame and Book play worse. With the new rules the NBA is implementing to lessen the foul baiting, he will not be hurt while many will.  He is elite, yet somehow people still put guys like Booker, or Trae Young, or Zion over him. Obviously the majority would put Tatum over those guys, but there is still too many not doing so.  No bias whatsoever."
"With all of the context this rivals the “Y’all look so different” meme potential too.  *“Get outta here man, that’s my teammate!” Patty Mills says as he shoves Udoka before embracing Kevin Durant, patting him on the chest. “Fuck outta here!” Jayson Tatum yells. “We know how to lock Patty’s ass up,” Udoka confidently states. They all laugh it off and resume the celebration.*"
Jayson Tatum and Matt tkachuk were friends in high school
“Fuck outta here” - Jayson Tatum (2021)
“Fuck outta here” - Jayson Tatum (2021)
You somehow have a worse back tattoo than Jayson Tatum stop whinging Doncic
Jayson Tatum might have something to say.
Might get hate for this but I think Jayson Tatum was a top 10 player this year and I think itll be the consensus after the next season. Hes my MVP pick.
* PG - Stephen Curry * SG - Anthony Edwards * SF - Kevin Durant * PF - Jayson Tatum * C - Anthony Davis * Zach Lavine * Donovan Mitchell * Bam Adebayo * Zion Williamson * Cade Cunningham * Moses Moody * Trae Young
WHERE’S THE JAYSON TATUM HATE NOW?!?! Act like that man wasn’t the 2nd best player in the gold medal game
jayson tatum cute asf u can’t tell me otherwise
Jayson Tatum! Youngest player to ever win gold!
and Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum and Ime Udoka both win gold. LFG
Ya forgot Jayson Tatum
1) KD  2) Jayson Tatum  3) Jrue Holiday  4) Everyone else...
"I want everyone except Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum and Draymond to give KD their medals"
I thought 14 was the minimum age for the Olympics but I'm glad they made an exception for 10 year old Jayson Tatum. This kid is good
"Jayson Tatum, American Hero"
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
DAMN SON JAYSON TATUM IS SO HANDSOME
"Jayson Tatum  n'est pas un tireur de place en place, il ne va pas courir au coin pour tirer comme s'il était un troisième choix, salope ce n'est pas jj redick, c'est un demi-dieu putain, steph curry réincarné mais cette fois il n'est pas une lâche putain, il tire du logo putain et vous battre en même temps"
Jayson Tatum doesn’t know you’re allowed to pass in international ball
Jayson Tatum is absolutely huge now lol

"Lmao no way  It’s hard to argue that we have 2 players that even SNIFF Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in terms of current talent. There may be an argument that we have the deeper bench, but good benches don’t win games without good starters"
"Wade is short (6’ 4”) but with a freakish 6’ 11” wingspan. The dude has gigantic arms. For reference, Booker, who is listed at 6’ 5”, measured at a 6’ 8.25” wingspan. Jayson Tatum is 6’ 8” and has the same wingspan as Wade. Wade is not your typical “undersized” shooting guard."
I met Jayson Tatum. He was like 6 at the time though.
"its funny how MJ in 13 playoffs has played against more 50+ win teams then Lebron. MJ would make the finals every year alone if his toughest competition  was Paul George, Rose, 5'9 Isaiah Thomas,  Victor Oladipo, rookie Jayson tatum"
"“In a shocking turn of event, Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum has demanded a trade to the Washington Wizards to play with his buddy Bradley Beal. It has been Boston’s plan to wait out for Beal and sign him next season.”   Tatum booms us"
Lakers effect. All their players end up being overhyped as soon as they put on the yellow and gold. Remember when Kuzma was better than Jayson Tatum?
Why Jaylen Brown over Jayson Tatum? also Demar Derozan is on the Bulls.
"“In a bizarre sequence of events, Jayson Tatum is forcing a trade to the Lakers and Jaylen Brown is retiring from professional basketball to become an entrepreneur.”"
“Celtics forward Jayson Tatum has announced his retirement effectively immediately. He intends to move to Kabul and join the Taliban”.
"Your eye test + a poor international tournament overwrites years of being a top 10 player.  Lol what a trash take.  I guess you think Jayson Tatum is dogshit too for averaging 14/2.6/1.4  Brown with 8/4/1 in FIBA last year too, he must be a terrible player as well.  What a ridiculous way to judge players."
"Ah yes, star point guards Zach Lavine and Jayson Tatum"
this thread is so fucking funny. the knicks have one fluke season and lose in the first round and suddenly they're better than a team with jayson tatum and jaylen brown. good grief lol

Tatum is what you would get if you took the brain of Javale McGee and put it in the body of Jayson Tatum

Crazy to think that Jayson Tatum could be playing in his 4th Olympics when he's 32.
Jayson “it’s gonna be either BRICK or SWISH” Tatum
Thx for Desmond Bane   Your username is trash too.   Jayson Tatum might average 20 this szn. Evan Fournier is &gt;
Jayson Tatum stock plummeting
"If we are gonna lose, I would rather lose with KD chucking all the shots, instead of Jayson Tatum missing wide open shots. Pass Kevin Wayne Durant the damn ball."
Pop is a joke not starting Jayson Tatum
Julius Randle literally was one of the 15 best players in the league this season and somehow a bad 5 game stretch in the playoffs is enough to invalidate that despite jaylen literally never putting on a carryjob like randle did for the ten games jayson tatum missed let alone the full 72 randle carried the knicks through
That is true and I'm proud of him for it. Was mostly referring to his Jayson Tatum comparison comment
Crazy that Jayson Tatum just turned 15 this year.
"&gt; I don't think locking up Smart and Williams for 4 more years is good enough for a title.    Agreed 100%, but honestly I'm not sure if a title in the next couple years is really realistic anyway. I think Boston has to look at a title window as a bit further off, but their short term goal should be to make sure Jaylen Brown and then Jayson Tatum re-sign with the Celtics. I would be really worried that all these guys they've just let walk in recent years could be seen as a troubling sign by those two.   Really the focus should be on Brown, who will be extension eligible in two years. Boston needs to make their case that he can win with the Celtics before then x otherwise he might reject an extension offer. I feel like if Brown wants out then Tatum will be soon to follow."
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
"Everybody is exaggerating just how bad we are, yeah our bench isn't great, but we still have Tatum/Brown/Horford/Smart.   Jayson Tatum is good enough to carry a mediocre supporting cast to a fairly decent seed."
"give me jayson tatum, earl tatum and mark tatum  bet mark’s jumper is wet af"
"Now show his playoff numbers from the last 4 seasons. Russ is good in stretches, but he hasn’t been a good player in the post season since before Jayson Tatum was drafted."
"As a raptors fan, I’m most jealous of jayson tatum"
I’m jealous of Boston’s absurd number of rings and Jayson Tatum.
"I always trust the team with the best player, and that's clearly Jayson Tatum. Brown is far ahead of RJ at this point as well. Thankfully the rest of our roster is deep, but especially in a playoff setting the bench seems to matter less and less. Only good thing is that so far our two guys have been incredibly durable."
Jayson fucking Tatum.
Moving onto another point guard nightmare while Jayson Tatum exists
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain – including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 – all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year – and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
Jayson Tatum and Trae Young the only ones who have taken their teams to a conference finals
"Are you looking at the average for the league...or by position..? It doesn't make sense to lump the power forwards and centers in there. Amongst guards he's actually better than guys like Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Drose, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Westbrook"
Great Stuff:  Jayson Tatum.
They can get a team after Jayson Tatum retires. Because I'm sure the second St. Louis got a team he'd be demanding a trade there. He loves his hometown
"We are now receiving reports that Richaun Holmes is heading for Boston in exchange for someone, and it could be Jayson Tatum."
Jayson Tatum has more playoff wins than your franchise since the iPod was released.
"Dame, Booker and Bam have been underwhelming in that starting lineup...it looks like they still havent adjusted to the Fiba rule differences and continue to hunt for fouls. KD is honestly singlehandedly keeping that starting line up in games, although Jrue has been awesome as well.   I think Pop needs to find more mins for Dray and Jayson Tatum...Dray has been so much better than Bam in every facet and Tatum has been the only other reliable scorer.. just not getting a ton of mins. Zach Lavine has also looked decent (albeit limited run compared to Booker)"
"Drazen Petrovic deserves a mention. Go ahead, I'll wait while you look up his stats. I would not include any other C in this but Kareem should be in there. I know centers get everything from within 5 feet of the basket but have you ever tried to sky hook? Dr. J might belong here, Adrian Dantley too. Karl Malone definitely belongs here. Jayson Tatum and Klay Thompson are both working their way into this conversation."
"And Jayson Tatum will be, what, 26 by then?"
"Entering the 2017-18 season we had:  Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes.  We also controlled the rights to Sacramento's draft pick in 2019 and had the Grizzlies first-round pick protected 1-7 until 2021.   It was such a ridiculous position to be in that Zach Lowe at that time called it maybe the greatest rebuild in the history of the NBA coming off the KG-Pierce trade where we blew it up.   Now, only 3 of those players remain, and both of those draft picks that were thought to be treasured assets turned into late-lottery picks. It's unbelievable.   Curse of IT is/was real. Let's hope it's ended now that Danny is gone."
Jayson Tatum just called game
More Jayson Tatum next game please
Jayson tatum.
My name is Jayson Tatum and I'm gonna teach you how to tie a tie
Can someone tell me how Zach Lavine is above Jayson Tatum on the depth chart?
It escalates as you earn accolades. For example if Jayson Tatum made an All NBA team this most recent season he would have made like $30 million extra on his contract
They have Jayson Tatum. They are in a fantastic place...
"Neither of them are 3's anymore. They were borderline 3's when they came in the league, and the league has shifted far away from that at this point, and they are also getting too old to even remotely be able to keep up with athletic wings. Jayson Tatum would and does absolutely cut through them like butter with a hot knife."
"It must really value offensive boards,  because Kanter has a higher rating than CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell, and Jayson Tatum, amongst others!"
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
"Bagley will be a 25 ppg 12 rebound pg guy by the time hes 25 AT THE LATEST The kings fucked up bagley FROM DAY 1 by trying to go for the 8th friggin seed instead of just giving fox and bagley 35 minutes a game to develop and even more importantly develop CHEMISTRY Fox should be able to hit bagley with a rim runni g alley opp in his sleep by now but i can literally count on one hand how many alley oops fox threw to bagley out of the pick n roll last year Fox is atrocious at running the pick and roll and he ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T BE IF BAGLEY HAD BEEN RIM ROLLING FOR 35 MINUTES A GAME FROM DAY 1 Instead, somehow joerger convinced himself bagley was good enough to close out games in the 4th quarter AS THE #1 OPTION ON OFFENSE But somehow wasnt good enough to start This is why joerger was fired and hasnt been re hired since Divac went out and got harrison barnes Bagleys rookie season to play the 3 leaving the starting 4 spot WIDE OPEN FOR BAGLEY What does this absolutely retard joerger do? He starts bogi at the fuking 3!!! And bogi gets injured within the first week Again, it wouldn't be SO WEIRD if joerger didn't have bagley CLOSING GAMES PLAYING THE 4TH QUARTER FROM THE 7 MINUTE MARK UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME And again, it wouldnt be SO WEIRD if the kings offense didn't COMPLETELY RUN THROUGH BAGLEY IN THE MID-POST FROM ABOUT THE 7 MINUTE MARK IN THE 4TH QUARTER UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME If i were bagley, it would ABSOLUTELY PISS ME OFF, THE SACRAMENTO FUKING KINGS GET THE SECOND PICK IN THE DRAFT AND DONT START HIM WHEN HES PUTTING UP 22 AND 11 PER 36 ON INCREDIBLE EFFICIENCY FOR A ROOKIE? Even jayson fuking tatum started for the Celtics as a rookie being the #3 pick in the draft and the Celtics were LOADED The kings hadnt made the playoffs in 15 god damn years when bagley got there FOR VERY GOOD REASON IM SURE HE THOUGHT HED BE STARTING AT THE 4 AND GETTING UP 20ISH SHOTS PER GAME DAY 1!!! Instead joerger wanted to make a ""push"" lol for that coveted 8th seed to be swept into oblivion You cant BOTH develop franchise players AND compete for the playoffs The kings havent learned this is almost 20 years of repeating the same dumbass mistake I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU that bagley will either be gone this season as hed made it abundantly clear hes miserable in Sacramento, or next season When he leaves, hes either going to get traded to a team that plans on using him thenway hes supposed to play... Or bagley is going to sign with a team where he knows hel FINALLY get the chance to be the focal point of the offense and put up 20+ shots a game I love how the kings fan base has already psychotically convinced themselves that bagley will always be a terrible defender lol IT TAKES 4 FULL SEASONS... 4!!! FULL SEASONS, Bagley has played 115 games, the equivalent of about a season and a half, but anyway it takes 4 FULL SEASONS before 99% of 1 and done bigs are no longer a liability on defense I expect bagley to be a VERY VERSATILE DEFENDER Able to start at the 4 and stay with 90% of the players hes assigned to defend, not to mention at 6 11 with a 7 1 wingspan someone that can SERIOUSLY BOTHER 3pt corner shots, which will be what the majority of 4s in next years nba will be doing next season... Standing in the corner and shooting 3s I think bagley speed and vertical will bother those just a lot more than ur average 6 6/6 7 wing defender As far as bagleys ability to play center on defense First of all more and more teams are using a 5 out offense where the center niether sets a pick or rolls to the rim Again 90% of bagleys defense will be closeouts at the 3pt line In the cases where teams do run the pick n roll and bagley is playing center, its going to take some reps for bagley to get a good feel and timing to his pick n roll defense Probably 1 FULL SEASON WITH AT LEAST 75 GAMES PLAYED But with bagleys athleticism once he gets the feel for the defensive side of the ball hel be able to.play 35+ minutes a game If he plays 35 minutes a game hes going to.put up.allstar caliber numbers Oh, one thing u forgot about when talking about necessary skills for todays bigs... Offensive rebounds!!! And bagley is one of the best offensive rebounders in the nba, and possibly the best in the league at scoring on offensive rebounds do to his uncanny ability to get off the ground 2 or 3 times before most players even la d after jumping once And 2. Taking those small ball guys down on the post I can count on one hand the guys in the nba id rather have with the ball in the post than bagley With so many teams going small in todays nba The only way to make them pay is by 1. Dominating them on the boards"
"The year is 2034, Jayson Tatum has retired. Brad Stevens is rolling out a starting five of Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Al Horford"
this joke is older than Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum just turned 15 the other day
And Payton Pritchard is older than Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum is only 19!!
"Damian Lillard came into the league like 3-5 years after guys like Steph, Harden, Durant, Westbrook, etc yet he’s basically the same age.  I’m also surprised to see that Jayson Tatum is still 19."
Jayson Tatum?
Obviously Kyle Kuzma will become better than Jayson Tatum
Derrick Favors finally turned 30.  It feels like just yesterday that he was the Jayson Tatum of the NBA.
Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
1. Kevin Durant  2. (Would be Kawhi Leonard but he injured) Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Luka Doncic  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Joel Embiid  8. LeBron James  9. Jayson Tatum  10. Anthony Davis
That's nothing. Jayson Tatum is only 15.
Holy shit Jayson Tatum at 13
"To me he has not earned the max extension that Philadelphia gave him. He has underachieved in the playoff and has not really improved his game over four NBA seasons. Rookie extensions are generally based on the team thinking a player will continue to grow.   Every off-season he says the right things about working on his game and adding some sort of outside aspect. He posts videos of him hitting threes in workouts. He is probably just a midrange game away from being an MVP candidate, but for whatever reason that is a hill he refuses to climb. I understand why so many Philly fans are done with him.  Look at other players drafted high in the years around Simmons who have been successful. They got better year to year in during their time in the league. Look at a guy like Jayson Tatum who had the same rookie season as Simmons.   |Player|2017-18 |2020-21| |:-|:-|:-| |Ben Simmons|15.8/8.1/8.2|14.3/7.2/6.9| |Jayson Tatum|13.9/5.0/1.6|26.4/7.4/4.3|  Even guys like Lebron and Zion who come into the league and average 20+ points as rookies improved year over year. As some one who has watched Ben Simmons since college, he his still basically the same player he was at LSU. His biggest issue is shooting and he refuses to fire his shooting coach because it is his brother.   At this point, it feels like he is either unable or unwilling to change."
"Jayson Tatum, can’t wait until he finally turns 5"
"I don’t really understand what you are even trying to say here... are you claiming that playing with Ricky Rubio would somehow cripple jayson Tatum and tank his growth?  You obviously wouldn’t want to have a team where you are relying on RR to be the offensive focal point and knock down shots from the perimeter, but I really don’t see what would be so bad about having him on a team like the Celtics where there are plenty of other guys who can get buckets and Rubio could just be a pure distributor.. he’s a great passer, a lot better than kemba at least and Tatum seemed to play fine with him..."
"Yes I do agree, Kyle Kuzma is a better player than Jason Tatum. Now if we're regarding Jayson Tatum, I think differently"
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are both more than smart enough to get vaccinated
"Headline: NBA insider says Kyle Kuzma sees himself on the same level as Jayson Tatum  Quote: “I think that Kyle Kuzma perceives himself as someone like Jayson Tatum,” said Eric Pincus on a recent episode of the Lakerside Chats podcast.""  So Kyyle Kuzma didn't say shit but they sill write a headline that sounds as though he did."
How did Jayson Tatum or Draymond Green get deals with Subway?
"Giannis, Luka, Zion, LBJ, PG13 and my wildcard is Jayson Tatum."
I don't think that you can go by per minute.   35 ppg in 40 minutes is more impressive and a better indicator of a player stepping up than 27 ppg in 30 minutes.   But to answer your question...   What about Jayson Tatum?
Thais is so bullshit. Kuz maybe trash but he didn't compare himself to Tatum. If you read the article it says a reporter thinks Kuma sees himself as a Jayson Tatum type - whatever that means.
Dukes Young Core  Cam Reddish  RJ Barrett  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Wendell Carter Jr
"&gt; “I think that Kyle Kuzma perceives himself as someone like Jayson Tatum,” said Eric Pincus. “I think that’s how he views himself. And that’s great.”  What a clickbait article"
I too see myself on the same level as Jayson Tatum.
"Yeah Casuals like Kevin Durant, MJ, Shaq, Charles Barkley, and Jayson Tatum. Probably way more NBA players too."
"This is literally going out of your way to ignore context. Congrats. And yeah heading in the wrong direction with jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown, do you even listen to yourself before you hit enter?"
"ESPN does not treat the C’s like that haha, if anything they have huge anti-Boston bias. They love Jayson Tatum I’ll give you that but they’d rather see him on another team"
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
Jayson Tatum - George Gervin
Not really a prediction but wishful thinking either AD or Jayson Tatum
Jayson Tatum for cj
Jaylen Brown ——&gt; Kawhi Leonard ——&gt; Michael Jordan  Devin Booker ——&gt; Jayson Tatum ——&gt; Kobe Bryant
"But as great as ad is, he isnt as good as giannis. I dont really think ad could have won without another superstar or top tier all star (bradley beal, jayson tatum)"
Al Horford was probably the best player on the ‘18 Celtics. So I’d put him at 7 game ECF and Jayson Tatum down for last year which was 6 game ECF
If Zion can get a jump shot and a better team I pick Zion but Jayson Tatum has a clearer path to a better career.
I’ll do you one better; Jayson Tatum wasn’t *alive* for the King’s last playoff appearance
Ok? and He was literally moments away from losing to a teams led by Victor Oladipo and rookie Jayson Tatum? and both those teams aren’t in the same galaxy as this years Suns.
&gt; Kuzma was better than Jayson Tatum  LMAOOOOO ISTG 2017 had the WORST TAKES
well they also thought Kuzma was better than Jayson Tatum so i'm not sure their judgment is the best
"You can out Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Zion WIlliamson, Paul George, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, ect. on the Timberwolves and they will still almost certainly be a Lottery team.  Basketball is a team sport, I find it outrageous to blame the Star for a teams lack of success."
Jayson Tatum.
Jayson Tatum no bias
Jayson Tatum
"Yeah, no, I’m gonna root for Jayson Tatum and USA."
"Mark my words, Jayson Tatum will play for Phoenix someday."
"Replace Dbook by Jayson Tatum, will they win the chip?"
also liam antetokounmpo could dunk on jayson tatum jr.
"This is why you love Giannis, many players, for example Jayson Tatum is a big one, would try and take a HERO BALL step back three instead of drive the ball!"
"One thing we know for sure is Jayson Tatum is still a virgin, since he was only born a few years back, and his “child” is a paid actor."
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
Trae Young (age 22 now)  Jayson Tatum (age 23 today)
"As a 5 lmao not as a 4, he didn’t get that playing power forward  &gt; Name one 4 who will absolutely dominate Jokic 1 on 1?  Jayson Tatum, but That’s not how defense works, it’s a problem when offenses force switches"
Jayson Tatum
"okay i love me some jayson tatum and jaylen brown, so let me put my two cents in.  jaylen brown is clearly underrated and is a good player on his own. i would say jaylen is slightly more efficient than tatum. however, tatum is better than jaylen brown. no doubt."
"Jayson Tatum has superstar potential, Jaylen Brown just all star potential."
"Rudy Gobert, Cj McCollum, Anthony Davis.  That last one is salt. The real answer is Jayson Tatum."
"You could work and coach Tatum until he is basically playing games like Jaylen Brown. You need him to be on a team where he's not the best player, but you could do it. You can't make Jaylen Brown into current Jayson Tatum no matter what you do because Tatum is more talented."
It's clear I think. Brown is really good and has a lot of potential but Jayson Tatum is another level of player
I would back Jayson Tatum over Jaylen Brown
Thrist? The holy trinity??? Jayson Tatum 50 point playoff game??????????????  Um excuse me father ya got a minute?
"Our bench has been one of the major weak points this season, but I agree they stepped up huge tonight. Nets has a fairly good bench and we have to take advantage of that if we want to have any chance to win. The rest, of course, is having Jayson fucking Tatum keep pace with the Big 3."
Jayson Tatum is the closest thing we've seen to Kobe.
disrespectful that jayson tatum isn't front and centre in these commercials
I hate Jayson Tatum so much. Fing Dukie.
"Nah but the Nets are the super-powered team here.  Jayson ""Billy Butcher"" Tatum  Jayson ""Hughie Campbell"" Tatum"

"Because every player not named Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kemba Walker were injured in those games."
"In games that Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kemba Walker all played the Celtics went 17-16.   The injuries definitely took a toll and losing the 50 games Hayward played for them last year hurt too, but they definitely underperformed even when close to healthy."
"Tyler Herro - He had a good playoff run whilst being young, gets a lot of hype. Scorers naturally get more hype too. People were high on him but now kinda regret it seeing as how he slowed down a bit this year.  Jayson Tatum - Compared to Jaylen, he came out first, jaylen's kinda living in his shadow. BI plays for the pels, he'd probably get a lot more hype if he was somehow still on the Lakers. Jayson also has big games and people remember those more.  Ben Simmons - Generational talent that could be much better if he somehow learned to shoot better, there's nothing wrong with people saying he's good but at the same time he could be much better if he could shoot which has impacted their playoff run  Andre Drummond - AKA Big penguin. He plays on the Lakers, obviously backlash is going to be a little more overblown. But i mean he clogs the lane when both the stars play, he's meh when he comes to stopping the PnR the Suns run. He also has like 0 offence and bricks when its not a dunk or a layup under the bucket."
"Tl;dr: No I’m not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team’s health that didn’t end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami’s probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There’s actually a ton more reasons I’m very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I’m happy to share if you’re interested though."
"So what you're saying is...   Tyler Herro is the next Michael Jordan.  Ben Simmons is garbage.  Jayson Tatum is the greatest of all time and he's only 19.  Drummond is Drummond.    In all seriousness, all I'm saying is some of these players get too much love while others get too much hate. Maybe it's justified and I'm just not really seeing why..."
well he's either Jayson Tatum or Kyle Kuzma
"&gt;Jayson Tatum ... people were saying he should have had Rookie of the Year    He was on the very fringes of that discussion. It was all Mitchell vs Simmons.   &gt; but his first two seasons weren't even great compared to other players in his class.    He scored the second most playoff points in NBA history for a rookie and almost lead a team to the finals in his age 19 season, but you don't understand the hype?    &gt; I think Jayson Tatum is a great basketball player ... Jayson Tatum is one of the players that are the future of the NBA he will be around for a long time ... He is a smooth handled, 2 way guard, that has a slow pace at times and quick one at other times. He can shoot, drive, rebound, and defend. He is as talented as players come in the NBA, and he is coming off a fantastic season    It sounds like you think that he is worth the hype. Did I mention that he dropped 50 a few times this year?   (And Im ignoring that you called him a guard)   &gt; but my secondary issue with the love that surrounds him is the amount people ignore other talent with similar age and play style. Brandon Ingram and Jaylen Brown    What is this logic? Is there only so much love to go around?   Your issue with Tatum is the Ingram and Brown don't get enough credit? What does that have to do with Tatum getting his rightful credit?   &gt; nobody showers these two with the same kind of love.    Didn't Brandon Ingram win MIP last season and then plateau this season?   And Jaylen gets a ton of credit for his improvements."
"3 years ago today, Jayson Tatum boomed Lebron."
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Kemba Walker are clearly their 3 best players."
kuzma is just like an older jayson tatum
But he blocked Jayson Tatum!!
They're not ready for Jayson D. Tatum
Yea there isn’t a debate. It’s clearly Jayson Tatum.
"Tatum,100%. Ja is great and has a lot of potential but I feel like Jayson Tatum could mess around and be a MVP Candidate next season. He's that good imo."
Jayson Tatum by a country mile.
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."
I would say that’s a mix of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown getting better and Brad Stevens finding defined roles for everyone. I’d say the reason they were worse with Kyrie was Brad Stevens failing to find defined roles for everyone and not being able to get the team on the same page.
pretty sure jayson tatum *could* if you really wanted him to
But [Josh Jackson has already surpassed Jayson Tatum!](https://valleyofthesuns.com/2018/02/24/josh-jackson-has-already-surpassed-jayson-tatum/)
Yeah same way I think Ben Simmons is a more complete player than Jayson Tatum
"If Kemba gets bought out he goes to the Nets too and they have a battle of exes with the Celtics. The Celtics see their two exes Kyrie and Kemba on a date together and freak out. Jayson Tatum screams ""I never loved you"" at Kyrie and Marcus Smart says, passive-aggressively to Kemba ""It's so great that your standards have gone to shit along with your knees."
"Yep Kyrie played pretty bad. Choked almost as bad that series as Jayson Tatum (36% FG, 2/16 from three), Gordon Hayward (34% FG), Terry Rozier (29% from the field, 3/19 from three), and of course Marcus Smart who made a whopping 1 basket."
Jayson Tatum
Lol I remember there was a joke years ago about Jaylen Brown being flat top Jeff Green and Jayson Tatum being light skin Rudy Gay
[I_Said_Joe_Mama] Sources indicate Luka Doncic and Jayson Tatum may team up in Sacramento down the line  Am I doing this right?
"The toughest he had was going to game 7 vs the celtics in the ECF, and Lebron went to 7 despite the celtics best player being rookie Jayson Tatum lmao."
"Well since we're just throwing shit at a wall that could eventually be true in half a decade: ""sources indicate to me Jayson  Tatum and Donovan Mitchell will team up on the Lakers down the line"""

"&gt; pull off getting guys to want to come to play with him... guys like a Jayson Tatum down the line,   There is no ""down the line"" for lillard, it's win now, his career is approaching the end. I think he has like 4 good years left in him."
"That it was a terrible take at the time that's aged horribly. I richly deserve to be dragged over the coals for it.  I'll take a victory lap on ""I'd rather have Jayson Tatum than Ben Simmons if I was a GM"" though."
Jayson Tatum IS The Pro-tato
"TS% l lol that tells me all I need to know about you.  So Jayson Tatum shoots better from the field, better from 3 by almost 5%, and even shoots in the 80s from the free their line, but bc Trae shoots so many BS free throws his TS% tells you, the analytics baby fan, that’s he’s ‘efficient’. 😭  He is not efficient that is what is what’s separating him from Dame, Steph, Kyrie territory. I don’t care about TS %. Ts% will have analytics baby fans saying James Harden is as good as Michael Jordan    As far as the rest, saying he “needs” to shoot —-in his 3rd year, as if he’s been playing forever and this is the proven only way—-is like telling Jordan his year 3 he “needed” to keep averaging 37 a game. What was he averaging when they won chips??! Go look at his scoring progression. 37, then 35, then 33, then 32, then when they finally won it, 30. What you think he was getting worse? No. His scoring tapered as his teammates got better. Which in turn made them better.   But at the same time, go look at Mike’s playoff numbers. THAT is when he went off. Averaging 35, 40 a game. That’s how you do it. With a team that’s legit 10 deep you absolutely don’t need Trae young hoisting. An efficient 23-25 with other busy all giving 15+ and that can be a 60 win team"
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now

The sad part about this is Kuzma will still be a role plyer. Can the guy get his own team so he can become Jayson Tatum please!
He’s actually closer to Jayson Tatum because this is his 3rd year and he put up about the same numbers as Tatum did in his 3rd year except Shai was more efficient.   Jaylen Brown 3rd year of production isn’t close to Shai.
It’s the Jayson Tatum experience
"""Jayson Tatum doesn't know his role""  ""Team USA only up a few at the half, team sucks ""  Yall foaming at the mouth rooting for your own country to lose"
"Jayson ""Kevin Durant"" Tatum"
"He’s closer to Jaylen Brown than Jayson Tatum. That’s not an issue, you guys just need to find the top-10 player."
Every moment is garbage time for Jayson Tatum

"That site has Westbrook as the worst WPA player on the wizards last year lol. Literally the worst.  That list is sorted by total number of shots taken in the clutch, not on efficiency. In fact if you look at the chart the player immediately following him, Chris Paul, is a much more efficient clutch player. And the player after that, Bradley Beal, and the player after that, De'Aaron Fox, and the player after that, Jayson Tatum."
