‚ÄúDwight Howard and Josh Smith played on the same AAU team‚Äù
Bro just got barbecued by Dwight Howard tho
Dwight Howard
He gets bodied by any physical center  He fouled out against Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley the other night ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Tell that to Dwight Howard in 2010 please.
Yes Dwight Howard made a career of not using his shoulders. You so big brain.
"Sheppard has done a poor job imo. Yes, he was put in a bad position with the way Ernie left the team but he can't commit to a direction for the franchise to save his life. Continues to keep Brooks employed despite evidence of him being a terrible coach and hired Mike Longabardhi on the biggest contract of a defensive coach despite being terrible.   The Rui pick in a vacuum was fine, but if the goal is to build a good team sooner than later around Beal then he wasn't the best pick. By your own admission we had little cap space and that was a weak FA class, so why pick a guy that showed he was a poor defender at Gonzaga to pair with Beal? He waived Dwight Howard, who could have actually helped the team's lack of rim protection, for CJ fucking Miles who barely played at all for us. And now he is given a 5 year 80m contract to Bertans who is also shit at defending and whose only purpose is to come off the bench and shoot 3s. I won't even get into the Wall/Westbrook trade, which even if you think was good was handled poorly.  Sheppard is like the old saying about how you can't be halfway pregnant. He wants to rebuild yet also wants to keep Beal at all costs, when the only real way we can rebuild with the current squad and cap restrictions is to flip Beal for assets. Like seriously what are we doing right now and what is our identity?"
Unless Turner has to face the powerful combo of 35 year old Dwight Howard or Tony Bradley  Or any physical center for that matter
He‚Äôll mold into a decent center after the season. Remember he hasn‚Äôt played in forever. He may be old and his injuries fucked him but he still has the skill to bring flashes to when he was the top big in the league. He aint no dwight howard
"Who in the world can break a 2-3 zone with Dwight Howard, Ben Simmons, and Matisse Thybulle. You‚Äôve gotta beat them from the corner."
Mans got outplayed by and fouled out against Dwight Howard lmao Embiid will dawg him when the play them again
"Dwight and K Love never played each other in their primes, but prime Love completely embarrassed Rockets Howard who was still a good defender while prime Dwight put up good, but not great games against young K. Love"
"I agree that some NBA players should jump the vaccine queue to build trust in vaccines. Minority communities generally have lower trust in vaccines and seeing stars like LeBron receive the vaccine would help build some trust. We are now vaccinating over 1M people a day (in the US) so lack of supply isn‚Äôt as big a factor as it was a few weeks ago.  At the same time, I worry that some players will refuse the vaccine and use their platforms to discredit the vaccine and spread distrust (Dwight Howard has expressed anti-vaxx views in the past). I believe that only players who volunteer to receive the vaccine should receive it and that it should not be required league-wide yet. Requirement should be re-visited once the vaccine is more readily available."
Ben is also taller than Dwight Howard
"There are some wild opinions that are highly upvoted and it confuses me lol. Some dude the other day said Dwight Howard had a solid career or some shit, like he wasn't a former multi-time DPOY and best big man for a stretch of years"
Just as dumb as a convo as melo and howard. All locks...     Just three that never were the best and never won a ring (as a top 2 player on the team... dwight)
I think it was Dwight Howard I saw him standing next to once and he was definitely at least a couple inches taller

People are saying Myles Turner after he fouled out defending 35 year old Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley üòÇ
"Covid, load management account for pretty much all 6. I mean you watched that game probably. It was Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, and G leaguers out there. No point in risking injury"
It's a pretty easy trade salary wise for the sixers to make. Mike Scott+TFerg+Tony Bradley+Poirier  gets it done. You can sub in some combination of Korkmaz and/or Dwight Howard as well. You can configure that however you want and throw in picks or your young guys to make it work.
When you study for Embiid but get Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard on the test.
Sixers did a great job but this game was on Bjorkgren   You got Sabonis who‚Äôs tailor made to just shred a zone if you put him in the middle at the top of the key or FT line to facilitate offense. They didn‚Äôt do it at all  Instead it was just pick and roll with TJ or Brogdon. They could never hit Sabonis or Turner on the roll partly because Philly packed up the paint. Easy solution is to just get a shooter on the weak side and kick it out that way amongst other stuff you can do to capitalize on it. And they never did at all. Just the same shit every time embarrassing  Also Myles Turner wanted the Joel Embiid smoke but couldn‚Äôt even handle Dwight Howard without fouling out. Also not good
"Super satisfying game with lots of cool stuff. Shit, even Dwight Howard was legitimately great!"
"Dwight Howard +23 off the bench, that is insane"
[Myles Turner decided yesterday to announce he was ready to step up to the challenge of Joel Embiid and then a day later put up 9 points/5 rebounds and fouled out against Tony Bradley and 35 year old Dwight Howard.](https://twitter.com/dansbadtweets/status/1356065509880582147?s=19)
Marv Albert gonna confuse Dwight Howard free throws with 3 pointers at some point this year
"76ers also have a much better team around Embiid, with another all-star and great defensive player in Simmons, and a borderline all-star in Tobias. Oh, and his backup is Dwight Howard, while Jokic is backed up by Isaiah Hartenstein..."
"As someone who hasn't followed Dwight Howard super closely throughout his career, I'm curious - have his hands always been made of cement? If not, when did he start to lose his touch? I know he's most likely a future HOFer so I can't imagine he's been like his his whole career."
"Really, the only center that I've seen do anything to Jokic's offense is Dwight Howard. So as long as they don't play Philly, Joker will be fine."
"Are you talking about the game a few weeks ago?  Where the nuggest played a bunch of g leaguers/rookies + 35 year old Dwight Howard?  Where a 6‚Äô3 rookie dropped 39 points on a healthy nuggets team?  That‚Äôs like asking why did KD not play when Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Jordan, Shamet, and Green are out.  Because there‚Äôs no point in playing a game you have a 10% chance of winning if you don‚Äôt feel 100%.  What‚Äôs more surprising is that the Nuggets defense is so mediocre that Maxey, a rookie who (albeit showing great growth and me believing he is part of the future of the team) averages 9.2 ppg,  was able to drop 39 points on over 50% shooting.  Embiid didn‚Äôt play because it was a useless game to risk health for.  Simmons, Curry, and Harris, his 3 best teammates, were all out."
"Between Curry, Green, Maxey, Thybulle, Milton I don't see him getting any playing time. I also don't see why we would give anything up for a 37 year old. Outside of an easily replaceable Dwight Howard and a pretty good Danny Green we have a very young team with many years to compete if it stays together. Giving up anything at all for a guy who wouldn't see the playoff rotation makes no sense."
"&gt;No, I think he‚Äôs a good defender in the post-season because he consistently ranks high in most counting and advanced stats, which is further confirmed by the eye test.  That is just not even remotely true. What stats are you looking at?  And what does your eye-test tell you? How do you not see him constantly die on screens? Missing rotations on the weakside? There are a million things that point to Rondo being a negatively impactful defender.   &gt;The same metrics that rank Markieff Morris a hair behind LeBron James and far ahead of Dwight Howard?  [They don't.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) He is among the worst defenders in the league."
"&gt;You accuse me of parroting narratives but think that getting a few steals means a player is a good defender?  No, I think he‚Äôs a good defender in the post-season because he consistently ranks high in most counting and advanced stats, which is further confirmed by the eye test.  &gt;No matter how good or bad defensive metrics are in actually ranking first to last it's a pretty good indicator when he consistently ranks horribly in all metrics that adjust for lineups like DRAPM or D-RAPTOR.  The same metrics that rank Markieff Morris a hair behind LeBron James and far ahead of Dwight Howard?"
Dwight howard and lebron
"because he was the best player on the best team. He carried the team offensively all year, and beat all the other top guards in h2h match-ups that year, and swept miami 4-0. He was clutch all season.   oh they were only 11th offensively so it doesn't count? You realize how dumb that sounds? What..they had to be top 5 to show that he deserved it? He was literally the only guy on the team that could create his own offense lol.  &gt; The voting wasn't close because Rose had the better media narrative  Nope you're wrong, no matter how much you wanna beleive that.   He had a breakout year where he turned into a superstar in his 3rd season. He had the best record in the league. Those are the only narratives.   &gt; the Decision"" Lebron and Dwight ""lol where even is Orlando?"" Howard.  cmon don't be dumb. Bron formed a big 3 and won less games than he did in cleveland the previous 2 years. Had a worse indidivudal season than he did the previous 2 years.   Dwights Orlando teams also weren't as good as they were the previous years  The bulls went from 41 team to 60+ win team in thibs first year. Y'all aren't even trying. At least get your facts straight instead of making shit up."
"And why did the Bulls have the best record?  Because Rose led them to the 11th best offensive rating in the league? Wow. Or because they had the top-rated defense in the league, something to which Rose contributed very little? Or maybe because the Bulls bench had a better Net Rating than most team's starting lineups, including the Bulls?  The voting wasn't close because Rose had the better media narrative, that was it. Homegrown local talent ""leads"" major media market to its best finish since MJ? Obviously he was winning over ""the Decision"" Lebron and Dwight ""lol where even is Orlando?"" Howard.  He wasn't even the best player at his position that year, CP3 was. If the Bulls had an average defense, if they had an average bench, both things Rose had nothing to do with, they wouldn't have won even 40 games with ""MVP"" Derrick Rose.  I will die on this hill."
*Dwight Howard.
"LeBron‚Äôs won the last 6 game 7‚Äôs he‚Äôs played, unless you‚Äôre taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He‚Äôs played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
having dwight Howard might hurt
Man i thought he was talking about Dwight Howard
That draft class was just stacked. Luka won MVP in Euroleague but the other prospects were very highly regarded as well. Look up how many players put up 20/11 with 65% TS as a freshmen in college (while being all pac 12 defensive team). Ayton was the seen as the most athletic bigman prospect since shaq even more than Dwight Howard (until Zion came around). I feel like if Luka hit the 3% a little better he probably would have been the pick. It is a projection no matter what.
"&gt;Pelinka letting Dwight go never made sense.   Yes it did.  Howard did rehabilitate his career last year, but there were significant questions about whether he could back that season up with another -- or if he'd get distracted, or disgruntled, or what-have-you, now that's he's won the ring he sought for so long.  Keeping Howard would have been a gamble, as was letting him go.  Dwight Howard has not been a reliable sure-thing for about a decade now.  Doesn't mean he cannot play, obviously, but relying on him has been risky for a while.  As recently as last August, many doubted that he would be useful to the Lakers."
Man i thought he was talking about Dwight Howard
How amazing is your franchise that not having Dwight Howard is the hard truth you gotta accept
not having dwight howard might hurt
"And that was with Bam and Dragic both getting injured in game 1 and missing games, and Butler getting a concussion at the end of game 5 when Dwight Howard cheap shotted him.  Not sure if Miami ultimately wins, but that's defintiely a 7 game series without all the bullshit that happened to the Heat in that series."
Dwight Howard?
Easy there Dwight Howard.
The same can be said about Dwight Howard. He made more 3s during his 2nd time with the Lakers then in his 8 years with Orlando.
"&gt;By asserting Bogut as some sort of counter-argument to the discussion, when he is actually a prime archetype of why people said the position was dying.  I've repeatedly expressed disagreement on what people ""thought"" about the position at the time. Many of those same people look at Rudy Gobert and are not impressed because he has no creation ability. The common fans evaluation of centers is limited to offense, NOT overall impact as many don't know how to assess overall impact to begin with in basketball let alone the position.    &gt;What they mean is DeAndre Jordan being a 1st team All-NBA Center, no center making a deep playoff run as the clear best player on their team, no superstar centers for years in the league, etc.  DeMarcus Cousins was better than Deandre Jordan, for one. You should know that media decided awards are not some end all test for player rankings. There's also a comparison to be made between Cousins and Towns regarding the lack of success for their respective teams, in contrast to their production and on/off metrics that support them being influential. If Cousins were someone else, would he have suddenly killed the ""death of the center"" narrative? Quite possibly. Certainly had the potential to be first team over Deandre Jordan!  Second, the very year after that Rudy Gobert emerged and Marc Gasol was clearly better than Jordan (an often forgotten part of this discussion). I'm not seeing role players in those two players. I'm not seeing a period where the best center in the league was a role player. That's kinda ridiculous.   &gt;He didn't revive anything, but subsequent players like Jokic and Embiid did, because the position did need reviving. They dispelled the notion of a center not being a position that could harbor a superstar, a clear best player on the team that hopes to contend.  That notion was stupid. Dwight Howard, despite all his offensive limitations, led the right supporting cast to the Finals. Of course another talented big could do the same. It just took the right player and the right environment.  ANYONE who denied that, was being an in the moment idiot, as are the people who thought the position was dying.  &gt;The notion of ""the death of a center"" was not one of people not posting up, it was a notion of centers being relegated to roleplayers in order to have team success. And this notion would persist still if DeAndre Jordan kept being the best center in the league and guys like Bogut at center were hallmarks of a competitive roster.  Deandre was never the best center in the league. We need to stop saying that. People who say that are the reason the ""death of the center"" was ever a thing."
"Depends on your definition of ‚Äúwashed‚Äù. Dwight Howard isn‚Äôt washed, but he‚Äôs not the player he once was."
Also ultimate bully Dwight Howard. But he's in foul trouble from 3 offensive fouls as soon as he gets minutes.
"Not really, he signed Dwight Howard in Houston while letting him get a ton of post-ups and tried to get Lamarcus Aldridge too. He's about talent over everything else and makes everything around that work as best they can. Morey has said before he would post up Shaq every play if he had him on his team. He's not the weird die hard caricature everyone assumes."
"i mean, if you're saying that Gortat was a horribly offensive big and i'm saying that one of the reasons the defense didn't dip when Howard sat was because of him you're kinda substracting from my point unless i'm not understanding you (not fighting, just saying what i took from your comment so you can correct me if needed)  On another hand, Gortat's opponents ORtg generally went down when he was on court and went up when he was not in Phoenix, at least. Being the back up of dwight it only went up just under two points so it's not that bad."
Yeah Dwight Howard is close but Joel‚Äôs offense gives him the edge.
"The worst argument is 2011 for sure. Fun fact about that year btw, Dwight Howard received twice as many combined 1st and 2nd place votes as Lebron.         |Player|Points|1st Place Votes|2nd Place Votes|3rd Place Votes|4th Place Votes|5th Place Votes| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Derrick Rose (Chi)|1182|113|6|2|0|0| |Dwight Howard (Orl)|643|3|57|31|16|11| |LeBron James (Mia)|522|4|26|39|31|12| |Kobe Bryant (LAL)|428|1|18|32|40|12| |Kevin Durant (OKC)|190|0|6|10|20|38| |Dirk Nowitzki (Dal) |113|0|5|3|11|30| |Dwyane Wade (Mia)|24|0|1|1|2|6| |Manu Ginobili (SA)|20|0|2|0|0|6| |Amare Stoudemire (NY)|9|0|0|1|0|4| |Blake Griffin (LAC)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Rajon Rondo (Bos)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Tony Parker (SA)|3|0|0|0|1|0| |Chris Paul (NO)|2|0|0|0|0|2|"
Russell was 6-ft-9 and 5/8 *in bare feet* when coming out of college. That's taller than Dwight Howard (*6-ft-9*) and Alonzo Mourning (*6-ft-9 and 1/2*) at their combines. Russell's height was fine for being an interior defensive force.
"Imagine Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Joel Embiid.  Fuck..."
Dwight Howard arguably had just a good case for winning that 2011 MVP lol
Don't really like drummond. He fills a lot of needs but hes the type of big like dwight howard was when he was with us where he does too much. Just need a big that has hands that plays his role well.
"I feel for him.  I hope he can come out of this stronger than ever.  Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing him posterize a few covid deniers, like Dwight Howard, for instance."
Tobias Howard would be lethal. 2010 Dwight with Tobias shooting ability
He's about to get on that Dwight Howard time
"""They have taken Embiid off""  ""Oh thank God""  ""Dwight Howard is now their Centre""  ""FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUCK"
Imagine going against a team that has prime Dwight Howard and Joel Embiid lol
What does Dwight Howard from years back have to do with anything now? Lebron should be the focus. Not Lakers.
If I were Dwight Howard I would be very good too yes.
It‚Äôs CP3 for me. Seeing him go from dunking on Dwight Howard to struggling to get past Eric Paschall has been rough. People forget how athletic young CP3 was.
Bruh that Dwight Howard/Shaq photoshop got me rollin
"Looks like you put a lot of thought and research into it, but I have some differing opinions. Magic too low at 7. Curry too high at 13, the big O was much the better player. Chris Paul at 27 and two spots ahead of Isiah is a travesty. Paul criminally overrated and Thomas won two titles during one of the NBAs golden periods. Dwight Howard is not in my top 100 neither is Draymond or Lowry. I love the fact that you put this out there. Thanks for saving."
So basically Dwight Howard was very good and if Rudy was Dwight Howard he would be very good also.
Dwight Howard in *shambles*
Lakers should have paid dwight howard
"Yeah and one day you will learn that playing with the two greatest shooters of all time made his life 1000 times easier than Kobe who played with 57 year old Steve Nash and injuried Dwight Howard.  Imagine actually ignoring that Steph UNDERPERFORMING still puts up 24 ppg while Kobe's second best player in 2013 shot under 50% from the FREE THROW LINE.  KD had it easier, plain and simple. Put 2013 Kobe in that Warriors squad and they win the championship with record numbers. Imagine not being able to double Kobe freaking Bryant every possession because he plays with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, that's what KD had."
"Kobe, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash, Antawn Jamison  /s"
Rudy Gobert is slowly turning into the best defensive player of this generation.  He's a legit one man defense.  The last time we saw this was Dwight Howard.  If he was D12s level of skilled on offense we'd be calling him a top 10 player easy.
Him standing next to Dwight howard is crazy too
If Dwight Howard did that he'd be exiled from the league
"you forgot boogie but yeah might be recency bias but demarcus cousins, dwight howard, anthony davis frontcourt rotation would be crazy."
"I don't know how much stock I take in these new ""accurate"" measurements, considering KD went all the way from 6'9"" to 6'10"".  What I'm getting at is that yes, dude looks built as hell, but since he's Magic-sized and not Wilt-sized, it makes sense that he'd look a lot more like a regular dude.  One of the craziest athletic bodies I've ever seen in the past 10 years or so is Nate Solder, the former New England Patriots first-round left tackle who won two Super Bowls. At the combine, he measured 6' 8 1/4"" and 319 (!) pounds with a 32"" vertical. And those NFL combine heights aren't measured in shoes. But look at what he looked like back then: [https://www.denverpost.com/2011/02/27/nfl-loving-solders-commitment-to-excellence-at-left-tackle/](https://www.denverpost.com/2011/02/27/nfl-loving-solders-commitment-to-excellence-at-left-tackle/)  He looks like a 6'3"" dude. No gut on that guy, and the dude was an offensive lineman. Likely the same height as Dwight Howard. And with great coaching and a great work ethic, no wonder he became the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL.  I also felt this about former defensive end Mario Williams, who is perhaps even crazier at 6'7"" and 295 lb with a 4.66s 40-yard dash, 35 reps, and 40.5"" vertical at the combine, like seriously, what? And seriously, he just does not look like a giant person when you see him without anything around him."
"I don't think so  Is it likely that a player is a super star without scoring lots of ppg? No. But that doesn't mean it's impossible  Stars are usually great on offence, and usage and scoring are both big indicators of offensive value, as well as what leads to ppg. So it makes sense that super stars usually get a lot of ppg  But it can be done other ways. I'd argue Dwight Howard was a super star in 2010 and he averaged 18.3ppg. Nash was definitely a superstar from 05-07 and didn't score a lot, including averaging only 15.3ppg in 05. Draymond Green wasn't quite a super star, but he was damn good for several years and never averaged more than 14ppg. Kevin Garnett in 08 was 3rd in his team in ppg, but he was a superstar  If you can play defence and/or be a playmaker then it is certainly possible that a player could be a superstar without getting a lot of ppg. With more ball-dominant all-around players it's more difficult than in the past, but it ain't impossible"
"He's the most proportional big dude I've ever seen with maybe the exception of peak Dwight Howard who probably had one of the most ridiculous builds in sports history. Even bulked up Giannis still has that gangly, Stretch Armstrong / Mr Fantastic type of build. Wilt, Kareem, etc, all looked like tall dudes even if you were to see a photo of them alone without anything else to provide relative scale because of the proportions. Wiseman straight up is a regular looking dude that's super-sized uniformly and it is kinda unnerving to see. Definition of spooky potential."
Dwight Howard was the only superstar HOFer of that generation. You had Joakim Marc Gasol Hibbert Bynum Horford !! They were good but this new generation my god....what a difference.
I can even put Dwight Howard in that group. He won 3 DPOY awards in his prime. Was a dominant rebounder and a better pick n roll defender than Gobert.
Dwight Howard on the Lakers
Jeff Foster cheap shot on Derrick Rose 1  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lynrCDw3W6A  Jeff Foster tries to injure Derrick Rose in the air  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TKZcnkIQxY  Lebron James steps on Draymond Green  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrBgdV1wy_Q  Dwight Howard concusses Jimmy Butler with a cheap shot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQI1vlulm0I
"Sixers winning this game wasn‚Äôt a surprise. An absolute elite team and anybody who disagrees haven‚Äôt been watching much Sixers basketball this season. Embiid is top two for the MVP (so far) this season and he‚Äôs not two. Ben is playing elite defense and getting his teammates involved in all aspects of the game, even without shooting jumpers (as a Sixers fan it makes me mad he hasn‚Äôt expanded his game, so slander can be made here) but if slander is made, at least acknowledge how valuable he is in other areas of the game as well. Tobias is playing arguably his best career basketball. Seth Curry is lights out and shooting career highs. Shake Milton is a 6MOTY candidate, if not front runner. Dwight Howard is adding a much needed spark in the absence of Joel when he is on the bench.   And last but not least, our commander Doc Rivers is the much needed coaching expertise our young core needed. Sixers by an absolute million and I‚Äôll see you guys in the finals.  Edit; Sixers are an elite team barring any major injuries to Ben Simmons or worse, Joel Embiid, since he is the heart and soul of this squad."
Dwight Howard tho
Dwight Howard got a T for his shorts getting torn off by another player. He also got a T for being fouled two games before that.
Kinda weird how Dwight Howard going for a rebound is now an illegal basketball play
Dwight howard has become short haired Steven Adams in terms of peskiness
If Dwight Howard tries to get rebound position it is a foul
"Are people really surprised by this? This is the Lakers MO. The Lakers are all about dirty plays. Do people forget about when the Heat were slaying them in game 5 of the finals, and then Dwight Howard concussed Jimmy Butler at the end of the game with a cheap shot, causing him to play ""strangely"" (aka concussed) in game 6?"
dwight howard would definitely be fine with that
"Embiid +21 already, Dwight Howard -8 in 3 min."
"Reminder that dwight howard got his championship ring today, while danny green opted to recieve his when he can be celebrated by Lakers fans. [Laker fans reading this rn.](https://imgur.com/a9MZjc9)"
Did Dwight Howard just deflect the pass that was aimed right at him? Like he forgot what team he's on?
"To most casual fans, a lot of people would favour T Mac over Dwight. Big men dont get the praise they deserve. Theres still people out there who think Dwight Howard wont make the HOF, which is absurd!"
Dwight Howard (LAL) lol
"Detroit has been garbage Drummond's entire career; Cleveland hasn't been the same since Bron left. If you put him on the championship favorites, he would be Dwight Howard on steroids"
KD Kyrie and Harden sure. But Griffin and Jordan aren't really a factor. That's like arguing the Lakers are stacked with LeBron Ad and Dwight Howard
"Who he have seen? Omer Asik, Dwight Howard, Capela???"
I‚Äôll always be nostalgic for All Star Weekend 2008 in NOLA. Dwight Howard threw it down as Superman and the whole place exploded. It makes miss the use of props and players actually having fun during the dunk contest
Specifically for ‚Äúimmediate impact‚Äù Giannis/ Embiid are out of the question. Giannis needed time to improve and Embiid was injured.   Probably Dwight Howard or AD or Jokic  Long term: Giannis / Embiid / Jokic / AD/ Dwight
Forgot to mention that Lakers had 3x DPOY Dwight Howard and Rondo who shot like Steph Curry in the playoffs last year. That‚Äôs literally a big 4
"Early 2010s was what? Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard &amp; Joakim Noah?       Mid 2010s: Marc Gasol, Boogie, Deandre Jordan, Drummond?          Theres Duncan and AD too but are they noted as Power Forwards?"
"2012 Lakers would also be good.  Kobe, Pau Gasol, Steve Nash, Antawn Jamison, Metta World Peace, and Dwight Howard."
Here's some evidence 90% of Lakers fans saying the Nets need 4 all stars when Griffin hasn't even been close to an all star these past 2 years but didn't say that shit about Rondo or Dwight Howard going to the Lakers?
&gt;CP3 didn‚Äôt put up the PPG for people to perceive him as worthy as a contender for that spot and he also didn‚Äôt have ringzzz. Westbrook wasn‚Äôt the best player on his own team even. People perceived Dwight Howard as a clown and then he also hurt his back  not even gonna mention kobe?
Probably not first but Dwight Howard would be  a high pick
"&gt; he was oft-cited as the 2nd best player in the league for years.  It‚Äôs an interesting point but Durants competition wasn‚Äôt perceived as as competitive during the time he was declared second best player in the nba.   CP3 didn‚Äôt put up the PPG for people to perceive him as worthy as a contender for that spot and he also didn‚Äôt have ringzzz. Westbrook wasn‚Äôt the best player on his own team even. People perceived Dwight Howard as a clown and then he also hurt his back   Now you have Steph, Kawhi and his FVPs and harden competing for that no 2 spot. Also Durant in 2012 had a better playoff run than anything Giannis has had which built him more credibility. Giannis has already lost two playoff series his team was favored in where he got outplayed by the other teams best player."
"Im not an old head, I started watching the NBA seriously in ‚Äò06, but fuck if I don‚Äôt have awesome memories of the Dwight Howard-Nate Robinson-Blake Griffin era of dunk contests. We need to get back to (at least!) when even when the dunks weren‚Äôt incredible the hype was supremely entertaining."
Looks kinda like dwight howard to me
I hate prop dunks. Theyve ruined the dunk contest. Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin ruined the dunk contest
When we gonna get a trans person in the WNBA? Asking for my guy Dwight Howard
Every contending team has ring chasers. What is Marc Gasol doing on the Lakers? Or Dwight Howard on the Lakers last year and the 76ers last year? You can‚Äôt blame players for wanting to play in games that matter.
This is very true and there very well documented instances of American government experimentation on black and brown people.  There is also very recent history of prominent NBA players outing themselves as being an anti science dumbass.  Earth is flat = Kyrie Didn't go to the moon = Steph No dinosaurs = JJ Redick QAnon Supporter = Dwight Howard  I can't shake the feeling this is LeBron also not wanting to get other NBA players pissed at him.
Next year we should do an anti 3pt contest gimme Ben Simmons Giannis Rudy gobert Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard
I think we can count dwight howard as a star for the sake of conversation
Dwight howard should have been in the 3 point contest smh
"If you wanna talk about recent history ‚Äî it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve been a losing organization since Dwight left. Like other smaller markets, we have to rely on the draft and development of these players but we haven‚Äôt been able to do this.   Thus, our younger players aren‚Äôt really that attractive to play with.   If you wanna talk about when Dwight was here ‚Äî well it‚Äôs not like we had the money to sign big time dudes anyway. We had our money tied up in Lewis, Nelson, Hedo, and Howard.   As for why dudes never wanted to come play here with him, who knows. Maybe they didn‚Äôt think the Magic could go far. Maybe they didn‚Äôt wanna defer to Dwight. Maybe it‚Äôs as simple as not wanting to come to Orlando lmao. I really don‚Äôt know."
"This is the man who said Andrew bynum was better than prime Dwight Howard. Bare in mind Howard was averaging more PPG on a higher fg%. Howard averaged more RPG, slightly more assists, more steals and more blocks."
Best I can do is Matisse Thybulle and Dwight Howard.
"Calling anyone who has a first name as their last name by their last name sounds really weird      Ex. Chris Paul, Lebron james, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard. The only exeptions to this are d‚Äôangelo Russell and Michael Jordan"
"&gt; ""If you know you can't pay him, you have to do a sign-and-trade and get a legitimate big. I think they should've went after Dwight Howard much harder, and you could've probably traded for Andre Drummond and added him to the group.""  How to torpedo your own argument 101"
"&gt; I think they should've went after Dwight Howard much harder, and you could've probably traded for Andre Drummond and added him to the group.""  Going to add ""Antoine Walker not being our GM"" to the list of things I'm thankful for."
"I mean, Dwight Howard was pretty much a waiver big and did a good job defending Jokic."
"I wanted to avoid an issue of having old guys who just shot a few end of half hail marys because they'd end up with a big difference. Like Dwight Howard has 80 career threes attempted. Idk, rookies kinda mess it up. An alternative would have been to include everyone and scale the dot sizes based on combined FT+3pA"
"Embiid always had the ability.  Just that this season he came into it IN SHAPE.   Before,  Joel would dominate for 3 quarters and fade in the 4th.  This season, he's in shape and stayed in shape....now he's performing at an all star level in the 4th &amp; in the clutch.     He's been an absolute monster this season and is easily the MVP so far.  I said at the beginning of the season that Dwight Howard's biggest contribution would be to influence Embiid to take his conditioning seriously,  because Howard is a physical freak.  Having a center on the squad that Embiid respects and can challenge him to be better has done wonders for his game and mentality."
"Yeah, some of these comments read like ""If he can't guard 3 match ups in the entire NBA, he should be cut from the team."" Like who else can the Jazz get that can guard Embiid, Jokic, *and* AD? The only centers that have put up good defense against Embiid are Horford (albatross contract), Gasol (not doing too well this year), and Baynes (not doing anything well outside of guarding Embiid). The only center I can think of that did especially well against the Joker is Dwight Howard in the playoffs last year, and that's because he was able to give up free fouls to frustrate him. The only way to neutralize all three of those star big men would be to sign them. Rudy Gobert is *very* good at defense, it's frustrating how he's criticized in this thread."
Dwight Howard
It's what happens when your name is Dwight Howard and you try to set a screen.
"Dwight Howard number one on the list. I‚Äôm in shambles. Lol.   It‚Äôs a pretty interesting list, thanks for sharing! It is definitely one way of measuring clutchness. I think counting the last five minutes of the game over the course of a career is a bit loose. I would be curious to see what the list looks like if you chopped it down to say the last two or three minutes of the game and only count the five best seasons statistically."
"Mitchell wasn‚Äôt, yet he kept jacking up terrible shots and letting our team get back in the game down the stretch. Add in a sprinkle 26 year old Dwight Howard coming off the bench, Hakeem with a Jumper, a Benitentiary and we‚Äôre in business"
You can‚Äôt two hand shove someone and you can‚Äôt hook a defenders arm. It‚Äôs basic shit that‚Äôs called all the time. Dwight Howard is usually good for both every game.
"In the most recent examples, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo both (potential?) future HOFers nowhere near their primes obtaining a ring with the Lakers"
Ask Dwight Howard who gets called everytime for moving screen but gobert doesn't get called or that
Dwight ‚ÄúThe Microwave‚Äù Howard?
I saw the highlight title and figured it was a first-half he was completely alone type of thing. Dwight Howard taking a 3 in the fourth quarter of a close game and making it was not what I was expecting.
"I actually forgot to comment this, but kudos to Dwight Howard he had tremendous impact defensively for Philly in the time he was on the court."
"Howard was shoved in the back by Gobert on that play, otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have been under the basket. Technically I guess the foul should‚Äôve been called for Dwight rather than Shake, but it was a foul nonetheless."
That clear out-of-bounds call where Royce made the save (and cost the entire game).. the Sixers player falling on Dwight Howard and getting the call.. Embiid getting rejected by the rim and getting the call.. want me to keep going?
"i feel ya. earlier this season we had to play against the nuggets with a 7 man rotation of  d green/dwight howard/maxey and 4 guys who are literally in the g league playing right now, because of covid/covid tracing"
Somehow Dwight Howard has a better career 3 point shooting percentage than Ben Simmons.
Dwight Howard hit one too. Center 3's all day.
Yeah they got screwed on 1 play. A basketball game isn‚Äôt decided on a single play lol. Maybe don‚Äôt let Dwight Howard be the best center in the nba for 5 minutes and you would have won
Dont be mad that your team just got manhandled by dwight howard. That used to happen all the time like 30 years ago
dwight howard is who gobert thinks he is
"First off, tragedy that this game wasn't televised. Two #1 seeds dueling and you don't flex this to national TV? I'm happy because I love Zu and Alaa, but that's ridiculous.  Secondly, I'll always find it extremely off-putting when a player, especially a star like Mitchell, gets two T's in overtime in an absolute dogfight of a game. Puts a sour note on the game for me. Yeah he's heated, his putting it all out there against an elite team, I really don't even care if he said he was gonna fuck the refs mother. Who cares? Let him yell. I'd rather that than complete apathy.   Third, Joel Embiid is just unbelievable. I know this is echoed a lot, but my god. Fucking running out to the three point line and burying a three at the end of regulation, finishing with 40/19, holy fucking shit. I would die for him. I'd die several times if I could if he asked.   Last, shoutout to Dwight Howard. That wasn't turning back the clock, that's a parallel universe. Amazing to not have to play Greg Monroe when Embiid gets a morsel of rest.  Finals preview?"
That 3 was a momentum shifter. Never thought I‚Äôd say that about Dwight Howard but then again nothing has been normal for the last 5 years so....
"""dwight howard clutch 3"" is not something that is supposed to happen"
"This is nba finals quality seventy sixers. What a win, playing from behind the entire game, just absolutely roasted by Jazz 3 point shooting, and then the entire roster steps up to play. Dwight fucking Howard hitting a three, then a steal in clutch time. MVPiid hitting a ridiculous 3 to send the game into OT, oh and also scoring 40+ and like 20 rebounds. Ben having his way in the post. Tobias Harris coming out of nowhere to dominate OT. Huge contributions from Shake and Matisse. Sixers bully ball getting the Jazz to commit stupid penalties"
Yeah I agree Dwight Howard is really good
The Dwight Howard three is the kiss of death
Sixers need Dwight ‚Äú1 minute of greatness‚Äù Howard back in
Embiid getting outplayed by the actual best center in the league - Dwight Howard.
The Dwight Howard 3 into steal and free throws was so absurd but clean at the same time. I actually started laughing.
"Dwight Howard: ""it's Dwight Howard time"""
"We‚Äôre so starved for 3pt shots that Dwight Howard is forced to shoot. This is why I hate this Sixers team becau‚Äî- He fucking hit it? What?  Edit: That is Ben Simmons‚Äô shooting partner btw. No, I‚Äôm not kidding"
dwight ‚Äúi‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù howard
dwight howard putting us back in this is not what I was expecting but yknow I'm here for it lmfao
THE DWIGHT HOWARD GAME LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
# GET THAT WEAK SHIT OUT OF HERE. DWIGHT HOWARD TAKEOVER YOU JAZZY FUCKS
Dwight Howard  edit: ***DWIGHT HOWARD***
If anyone can beat the Jazz it's 2021 Dwight Howard
Naturally if the rest of the team can't hit a three then we turn to our best shooter... Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard dunk contest-esque
"the year before the Rookies sported a 30 years young rookie Jorge Garborosa along with 22 year olds Paul Mislap and Andrea ""Primo Pasta"" Bargnani; 23 year olds Adam ""Mustache Morrison and Brandon Roy; and babies (21) Jordon Farmar and Rudy Gay.  Jorge was a year younger than KG, who would appear in his 10th allstar game the next night. And he was older than many of the other allstars, including Gilbert Arenas, Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard..."
"As someone that recently went through a back injury, it will never fully heal.  Look at Dwight Howard.  It took him years and serious weight loss to rehab his back, change his lifestyle, and remain relatively healthy on the court."
Last year with Jared Dudley and Dwight Howard
"""Analytics"" falters when it pretends that players are robots, and that probabilities never vary from moment to moment. Anyone who's ever shot a basketball knows that there's hot and cold streaks. Anyone who's ever played any sport knows how important confidence, pressure, and other mental/emotional factors are when performing.   If ""analytics"" were always right, then why does [Dwight Howard  shoot 80% FT in practice, but much worse in games](https://sports.yahoo.com/dwight-howard-actually-makes-80-percent-free-throws-002057899--nba.html)? The probabilities of his FTAs going in should be the same in both (it's the same ball, same hoop). But they're not.   The analytics-only folks remind me of [the opening of Dead Poets Society, where they're reading about how to mathematically calculate the value of a poem.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjHORRHXtyI)"
Yeah fan vote would've had Dwight Howard inevitably win it last year lol
"This is why he was so disappointed in Dwight Howard, he had all the same physical gifts as Shaq but never seemed to develop anything but one move."
Y‚Äôall have ridiculous standards y‚Äôall expected Harden to win a chip with bum ass Dwight Howard as his 2nd best player
"We do this mental gymnastics every time. And, yes, there can be some effect but its very rarely pushed to the extreme that fans trying to explain these things away pretend it is. And also pretend that this specific player is the only one feeling these effects, and ignore many other players are in the same situation. And we also have methods to adjust for these things that we can look at.  The Sixers also have Dwight Howard which is about as good of a bench rim protector as you could ask for."
Reminder:   Mchale started Dwight Howard and Omer Asik together
Some pairs that I can think of that haven‚Äôt been mentioned here yet:  LeBron and Horace Grant (03-04)  Kevin Durant and Sam Cassell (07-08)  Dwight Howard and Reggie Miller (04-05)  Kyrie Irving and Gilbert Arenas (11-12)
"Whoa whoa chill, I didn‚Äôt say AD carried the series I‚Äôm not sure where you got that from. I said they won game 2 because of AD and that‚Äôs the truth. LeBron simply didn‚Äôt have a good game by his standards until Game 5. LeBron is the second greatest player of all time, I expect him to close games out effectively not turn the ball over and miss open shots in consecutive conference finals games. But it‚Äôs okay because LeBron isn‚Äôt perfect, he‚Äôs a human.  Don‚Äôt compare LeBron to Murray, Murray had a great series for his standards, hes a 24 year old star not a GOAT candidate   Now you‚Äôre bring up rounds 1,2, and the Finals? Why are you so defensive of Brons overall playoff performance when I mentioned nothing about the other roundsüòÇwere talking about the WCF  I‚Äôm not a Bron hater, I know Bron is the MVP of the Lakers but nobody ‚Äúcarried‚Äù that Nuggets series. I know that because yes, I watched it. Dwight Howard and Rondo were huge in that series, other guys for the Lakers hit timely shots in the 4th cause Bron sure wasn‚Äôt hitting them lol and that‚Äôs okay. Be okay with that. You don‚Äôt have to be so defensive man  It is what it is"
And this contest has everything: the absence of Dwight Howard; Spud Webb;¬†a child.
"I wouldn‚Äôt classify Curry as the ‚Äúultimate ceiling raiser‚Äù and this season is proving that. Warriors are 8-13 against +500 teams which is 4th worst in the conference and the warriors have been blown out on multiple occasions. Curry relies on Kerr‚Äôs system too much and that why we see this team so non-agressive when Curry doesn‚Äôt hit his shots.  I‚Äôd classify Harden and LeBron as ceiling raisers because they have found success with lesser rosters in the past. Sure, harden never won a title with Houston but the man didn‚Äôt have a solid team and co-star until 2017-2018 which is a year that was looking like a victory for him before CP went down. post back injury ‚ÄúI still want my touches‚Äù Dwight Howard doesn‚Äôt count in my book. Especially when Houston‚Äôs most successful season with him was when he missed 41 games that season.  The Rockets are dog shit right now and injuries have def been a factor but Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Ben Mac, Danuel House, all look like shells of themselves without Harden controlling the offense. I feel you could swap Curry for Harden in 2015 and the warriors still win that title. Does Harden have a historic season in 2016 like Curry? Probably not but harden is too smart and good of a basketball player to not be successful under Kerr‚Äôs season with 3 all stars on his team (talking bout Iggy)."
"Gobert, AD, Dwight Howard, Shawn Kemp, Nikola Jokic"
Dwight Howard. He would be that dude in the movie who gets caught messing around in the laundry room with the drag queen.
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there‚Äôs no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there‚Äôs names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
Dwight Howard would probably be a better fit with Kobe than Shaq hypothetically speaking.
"They‚Äôre legit NBA players who could carve out a role for themselves later on...  AG/LaVine were the same when they did it, they weren‚Äôt established at all and they gave us one of the best dunk contests ever.  You want an old ass Dwight Howard who got invited just because of his name and because he plays for the Lakers?   Or you want young players who can potentially be nice players in the future but just need the chance to get more recognition..."
"I agree , Jones didn‚Äôt look bad at all! I actually had some Dwight Howard vibes from him"
"He should thank, dwight howard, chris paul , russell westbrook, trevor ariza, eric gordon , clint capela , pj tucker  and the refs/ adam silver when the rockets retire his jersey"
Gimme some Ben Simmons and Dwight Howard while you‚Äôre at it
*Dwight Howard enters the chat*
People still think Dwight Howard is good
"His deal and the extension makes very unhappy but has wide support from the fanbase, at least the pels sub.  I still think there was a different road where instead of selling jrue we bought chris paul and we would have been scary and easily picked up a good center for less money. I also dont like the actual jrue trade.   As for bledsoe vs hill, i just dont see okc agreeing to bledsoe.  Griff has admitted he has a preoccuptation with Adams. I like the guy but he just isnt a good fit and his skill set does not merit his contract.   I thought when we signed svg, we were gonna do a Orlando dwight howard thing with zon surrounded by shooters. A floor spacing big would have been perfect for that. Another aspect is that hayes and adams have overlapping skillsets so we have a lotto pick and 17 million per year tied up in roles that dont complement our best player.  Im pretty iffy on griff but only time will tell."
Jokic was getting clamped by washed Dwight Howard lol.
The same way that Dwight Howard was eating the equivalent of 24 Hershey‚Äôs bars a day via candy and soda.
"I‚Äôm interested in seeing you spin an actual bitchfit over a nickname he barely had and the residual salt filled negging spread across and over multiple players entire careers as constructive criticism. He bullied javelin McGee to the point he felt he had to speak out, he harped on Dwight Howard till injuries and age made it not fun anymore he never once gave them constructive criticism or offered to work out with them or in anyway ever did anything to help.  Just because he suddenly likes Embiid now you think he‚Äôs some sort of sage? Lmfao no he‚Äôs petty, self centered in the limelight, way over sensitive, and egotistical. It‚Äôs what makes him good entertainment. But you‚Äôre a fucking dummy if you think what he‚Äôs doing is anything that resembles constructive criticism. It‚Äôs called Negging, you double down that someone can‚Äôt do something and if they do it you are right because you get to claim you motivated them to do it and that you knew all along. If they don‚Äôt you were right and they were a schmuck that never lived up.  It‚Äôs right next to gaslighting and false flagging in the world of the emotionally under developed and the toxic."
Dwight Howard
Sounds like you just started watching basketball recently and don't actually know anything about Dwight Howard.   * #1 overall pick * 3x Defensive Player of the Year * 5x All-NBA First Team * 1x All-NBA Second Team * 3x All-NBA Third Team * 4√ó NBA All-Defensive First Team * 1x NBA All-Defensive Second Team * Olympic Gold Medal * Second place in the MVP voting * Dragged a mediocre Magic team to the Finals  Put some respect on his name. He's pretty much a lock for the Hall of Fame.
"Did you watch tape of Ayton outside of youtube highlights? If you went by stats and athleticism he was a 20/11 guy with 65% TS which is spectacular and more than any other 1 and done center that I can think of including Greg Oden and Joel Embiid. Also with his 7 foot height and 7'6"" wingspan to go with his [hops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeBhoVeFhT4) he arguably had a more elite combo of height/length/athleticism than any center since Shaq and more than Dwight Howard."
Active but not the same player now: Dwight Howard on the Magic  Active: Jokic  Historically: Tim Duncan or Tracy McGrady
"I would not put Dwight Howard in the HoF. If he is, he is not in Shaqs league. They are not comparable."
He's still out sadly. Fuck Dwight Howard
"This isn‚Äôt new. We used to bitch about this stuff with Dwight Howard and Shaq all the time. Webber used to talk about it.  Garnett. Pretty much every, single, good big man in the game goes through this.  Big guys are reffed differently. Why? Bc they dole out punishment too. It‚Äôs physical in the post.  If you called every foul in the paint that occurs there wouldn‚Äôt be a game to be played. It would be boring as shit.   All of the Denver fans who are constantly bitching on here about Joker‚Äôs free throws are looking at this wrong. It‚Äôs not a great crime. No one is out to get Joker. And my god, the league isn‚Äôt against you. Get over yourselves.    Adam Silver‚Äôs snake ass isn‚Äôt sitting in his hole at night polishing his head and thinking about ‚Äúhow can I screw over Joker and the Nuggetsssssssss.....‚Äù.  This is a right of passage. It means Joker is becoming a great big man. Not good, great.  He will have to figure out how to win and be effective, while being a bully, and at the same time not getting calls. Every great big goes through this. Quit bitching."
"Yeah, I think we're mostly on the same page, and I think I get your point that the usual pattern (save for foul trouble/blowouts) is that he plays most if not all of the 1st/3rd. I get why you said it the way you did, you were probably speaking to the substitution pattern and not him actually playing every minute. My mistake for taking it a little too literally.  &gt;those minutes  This is where I'm not sure if we're on the same page. As an example, as a Sixers fan, I know that Dwight Howard is almost always playing ""those minutes"" at the end of the 1st and 3rd quarter. I doubt he's the one center you were talking about but I looked through our past few games and being out there at the end of those quarters is his pattern. Whether Jokic plays the full quarter or not isn't really the point, but more whether or not he's out there when his team is in the bonus. I would bet that Dwight plays more when the Sixers are in the bonus at the end of the 1st/3rd than Jokic does when the Nuggets are in the same position. As a player who draws a lot of fouls but not a lot of shooting fouls, it might be worth emphasizing those minutes for him, that's the point."
"Very interesting comments. It is really tough because relative to peers, Duncan played in the age mostly when the center was dead or dying. Robinson, Ewing, Hakeem were on their way out. Young Shaq and early middle Shaq were light years ahead of old Shaq. Dwight Howard was a thing kinda. The Gasols were good for their time, but would be just another Brad Daugherty in the 90s.  For me: Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Hakeem, Shaq, Duncan. Moses is next but feels like the start of the next tier.   Yinka Dare is last."
Consider all time career defensive win share.  Russell: 133.6.  Duncan: 106.4  No one else is over 100.    Dwight Howard and Lebron James are the next contemporary players and the are in the low to mid 70's.
Harden played with Dwight Howard back when Dwight was drawing like 10 ft a game. It sucked.
Never heard anyone use flirting in a sentence about basketball unless if the sentence was about dwight howard and his teamates
Stewart got sexy prime dwight howard shoulders too
2011-12 he was No. 8 behind Dwight Howard and ahead of steve nash in MVP votes. He was in the top 3 before he tore his ACL.
generally accepted that it was dwight howard
"Fun fact: The injury expression he has is extremely similar to the persistent nerve issues Dwight Howard had when he was on the wizards.   Good news is that I've had almost exactly this injury, and unless Beal's condition is far worse than what I had recovery shouldn't be too bad. If it's extremely severe he may need surgery or a shot to reduce inflammation, if it's on the better side its just rest and physical therapy."
"I think the closest is James Harden, who played with MVPs Westbrook and Durant, former top 3 MVP finisher Dwight Howard, and former top 2 MVP finisher Chris Paul"
"You're putting recency bias onto it. He wasn't that heavily considered at the time. No matter what stats said, D rose played better and took a far worse roster to a higher seed. Those orlando roasters were underrated as hell and the offense and defense wasn't revolved all around dwight, despite what you might think. Even Lebron had a far better case for MVP that year than Howard."
"Probably not the earliest but by the end of his age 25 season Dwight Howard was already a HOFer imo.   By the end of his age 25 season he was already a 3x DPOY, 5x All Star, 5x First team all NBA, 4x All Defense (3x First Team all Defense). Granted he was only 19 when he entered the league but impressive nonetheless."
Holy fuck Dwight Howard 2011? Man get real...
I don‚Äôt think we will hear Dwight Howard say he is getting it.
"I read somewhere he totally changed his fame and was dropping threes and never dunking. Good to see he still has rocket springs for legs. One of my favorite all time dunkers.   I always loved the big guys who can jump. Dominique, Kemp, Dwight Howard..."
This man said Dwight Howard lmao
Couldn‚Äôt you swap him for Dwight Howard and have the same result. Ayton just pulled in a ton of offensive rebounds. I think that role can easily be filled by any replacement level center
Jokic gonna get abused by 40 year old Dwight Howard and carried by Jamal dropping 50 every game again
"No, that's Dwight Howard."
"I thought Dwight Howard would be higher up.   OP - this is so cool, thanks for sharing! Going through this list was a lot of fun."
\&gt; Montrezl Harrell said he doesn‚Äôt understand the ejection   &amp;#x200B;  Ref: Dwight Howard sends his regards
"You're right, whether it's PF or C, there's always been skilled and great bigs playing--it's just that the positions have really evolved throughout the years. This is nephew-level take from OP. The back-to-back MVP is a big who is fast and skilled like a wing, and has playmaking abilities. In 2017-18: Anthony Davis was third, Giannis sixth, and Durant seventh in votes. In 2013-14, Joakim Noah was fourth in votes. In 2012-13, Tim Duncan was seventh in votes. In 2011-12, Kevin Love was sixth and Dwight Howard seventh in votes. In 2010-11, Dwight Howard was second and Dirk sixth in votes.  OP is romanticizing this too much. It was only eight years removed when Noah was a point-center in the MVP discussion, just not as good as Jokic. A lot of bigs have adapted a perimeter game and some play like a wing (or are wings but are tall like centers). Either way, the ""bigs"" are not likely to go away; they'll just keep adapting and evolving."
"Dwight Howard, Kyle Kuzma, Kyle Lowry, maybe some other Kyles"
"Ah so when past-prime Dwight Howard showed up that made the Rockets a great roster from a terrible one? Not only that, but the Rockets still got the second seed without Dwight while MJ, Kareem, Wade, Hakeem, Kobe got low seeds if they made the playoffs at all when they were paired with poor rosters. So Harden has to be the GOAT in your eyes correct? You've opened my eyes thank you. Harden the GOAT, move aside MJ. Can't believe that bum couldnt get over 30 wins with a bad roster lmfao"
"Timelord is 6‚Äô8 with a 7‚Äô6 inch wingspan and an 40‚Äù vertical.   For a reasonable comparison, Dwight Howard is 6‚Äô10 with a 7‚Äô5 wingspan and a 39.5‚Äù vertical. He was a pretty damn good defender in his prime.   Timelord will be able to defend most 7 footers no problem. His athleticism and length is absolutely insane."

"the sixers added danny green, seth curry and dwight howard, and tobias harris got good again, and the celtics kinda don't play as a team anymore i guess i dunno, they're weird"
"Like the Magic with Dwight Howard, sometimes missed shots are your best offense."
"Ok but think of dwight howard,deandre jordan,Shaq, and finally wilt. What is something they all have in common? Large hands which are proven to worsen your shooting, Heavy weight which is a important factor in free throw shooting, and tall height. Now think of Bill Russell who is 6,9 220 pounds and has about the same size hands as giannis (Which is still pretty big). The fact is people like Wilt are not supposed or should be expected to be great free throw shooters because it is close to impossible. How much sense does it make to compare someone who is of above average center size and someone who would be of small forward or power forward size today shooting?"

"They overachieved and hit a wall. I'm not asking you to list what they've done I'm asking you to look at the fucking roster beyond Brown and Tatum and most of these guys are hardly NBA level players currently. Why WOULD you expect them to make a run? Philly added guys like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard. Real experience and depth. Boston lost Hayward and added more rookies, the ghost of Jeff Teague, and a Covid ridden Thompson."
"1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Dwight Howard  5. Chauncey Billups  6. Derrick Rose  7. Rajon Rondo  8. Bradley Beal  9. Avery Bradley  10. Michael Jordan  To change it to people I grew up watching, I'd swap out Hakeem and MJ for Kobe and Paul Pierce"
I love Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard shouldn‚Äôt be out there. Celtics have gotten 6 pts cause Howard can‚Äôt get anywhere near 3 pt line against the small ball lineup.
"NOW, yes he is.   Kobe was right at the time though, and I think that it took him 10 years to figure out how he fit within a championship puzzle largely supports Kobe's take at the time.   &gt;I tried teaching Dwight. I tried showing him. But the reality is that when you have a perception of what it is to win a championship - and most perceptions of what it's like to win are a very outgoing, very gregarious locker room where you pick each other up and you're friends all the time. That's the perception. And I think that's what his perception was of what the idea is. But when he saw the reality of it, it made him uncomfortable. And it's very tough to be able to fight through that, to deal with that challenge. And I don't think he was willing to deal with that uncomfortable and combative nature.~Kobe  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2015/2/26/8116095/kobe-bryant-dwight-howard-lakers"
"No I definitely agree with that. He will never score enough to be considered a real MVP candidate. Closest was probably Dwight Howard when he finished 2nd in, I think it was, 2009. But he also scored over 20 ppg. A player like Gobert will never win it"
No I'm talking about all the ridiculous shit I see about young players trying to make them into something they are not... If you let r/NBA Tell it. Zion is the next Lebron. Wiseman is the next Dwight Howard. And Trey Young is the next Steph Curry. It's ridiculous.
"Kenneth fahreid  Also, it pains me so much to say this, but Dwight Howard, since accepting his role, would be such a badass backup C."
Ah the Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard?  Partly cause he is a strong idiot though.
Dwight Howard has that effect on teams
"According to Max Preps it's :     Kevin Durant   Dwight Howard   Kevin Love   Derek Rose    Sebastian Telfair   OJ Mayo    Greg Oden     Idk, I'm not like super into high school basketball or even college basketball recruiting, but I do remember the hype around Durant. I don't really remember it for any of those other dudes besides, funny enough, Telfair."
And Dwight Howard
Mate look at videos of Dwight Howard practicing 3's. He looks like Klay Thompson. He can hit even corner 3's.
"Dwight Howard is literally old enough to be Maxey‚Äôs dad. Maxey will be improving his game long after Dwight is retired. Hell, Maxey won‚Äôt even be in his prime by the time Dwight is elected into the HoF."
"2016 Houston Rockets, second best scoring option was Dwight Howard putting up 14 a game (lol). Third option was Trevor Ariza (lol).  Harden put up 29-7-6 with 1.7 steals"
‚ÄúThe best ability is availability‚Äù  So you agree that Cory Joseph is one of the greatest players of this generation?  And that Dwight Howard has had a better season than Lebron James?
Post a vid when you see him do something besides a Dwight Howard pick and roll floater.
But rondo does hit shots in games. His shooting actually looked pretty damn good for the Lakers.  Even Dwight Howard does things that are outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't have a ton of post moves but I have seen him try to develop a baby hook and he will hit it from time to time.
"I think, that the case for Utah being a good, well coached team, put together around the DPOY very smartly, is stronger. Gobert's +/- has a lot to do with his contract and the wise decision to not overspend for a backup, who would be at best a lower quality knockoff of him and plays only limited minutes.   Him being off the court in some normal rest periods and a lot of garbage time should weaken the Jazz, but I also think that Dwight Howard for example could replace some of Goberts production, like in the case of Embiid. Only Gobert is more durable than Embiid and allocation of cap space in that direction would imo be foolish, since the return for that investment would additionally dwindle in the playoffs, when Rudy's minutes increase.  So in the end I doubt there is a real case, but the discussion is surely warranted and by no means ridiculous."
"this man got out scored by Paul Reed, James Michael Scott &amp; Dwight David Howard II, how embarrassing"

"Drummond went 13-36 from the free throw line that game. Hacking got so bad that season that Drummond, Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan were shooting 20+ free throws a game on a regular basis and 10:30pm games were finishing close at close to 2am."
"I don‚Äôt think he has. He got out scored by Dwight Howard, Paul Reed, and Mike Scott today. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but I have no faith in his offensive ability."
"I‚Äôm worried for the playoffs. The regular season no longer matters for the Sixers. Embiid is a MVP caliber player and they can‚Äôt wait on Ben Simmons much longer. He is an elite defender and does many things well, but games like today show his biggest flaws. He looks straight up disinterested at times, and even though he‚Äôs not a scorer he should not be getting out scored by Mike Scott, Dwight Howard and Paul Reed in a game without Joel. This year‚Äôs playoffs will be very interesting."
"I‚Äôll say it again, with more explanation for you. Basketball is more than just names in a box score. Do you genuinely believe that players don‚Äôt change in 2 years? Or that coaching doesn‚Äôt matter? Playcalling doesn‚Äôt matter? Yeah, I would love to swap DG with jbuckets, but that‚Äôs not the argument.   If it means Harris reverts to 32.6%!!! from deep, and ben/embiid have to play in the paint with another (admittedly fantastic) dominant ball-handler that doesn‚Äôt shoot the 3 very well, no, im not taking that deal. We also have Thybulle/Milton/Hill we can swap with curry depending on needs to get more defense on the court. Not to mention Dwight Howard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Monroe.   Compound that with our star 24/25 year olds ben/embiid now have 2 more years of experience, and YES god please give me this team over 2019. Seriously dude, as a sixers fan, I *hated* watching our half-court offense in the past. It was so stale, every. single. game."
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
By not having a center like Dwight Howard clog the paint every game. I'm pretty sure the Ben/Dwight lineups are some of the worst in the NBA.
"Even if he did, does that validate every unsubstantiated forum story about him since the dawn of time? He headbutted Dwight Howard once, so maybe I should believe that one poster who said he did 9/11."
"Sabonis and Towns were born in the United States. There‚Äôs also Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Dwight Howard, and Robert Williams."
"&gt;I think if it was possible, Derrick rose should come out publicly to renounce his MVP and award it to LeBron, the true MVP of that year anyways. So LeBron can have 5 MVPs and be the first 5- peat MVP. Rose doesn‚Äôt have the stress of what the MVP carries anymore  You know the funniest/most idiotic thing about this comment is that Dwight Howard was actually #2 in voting that year."
"dwight howard could lose vision in an eye, but his IQ and team play would be enough to push him over whiteside‚Äôs bumass"
"Dwight Howard averaged around 18/14 with over 2 blocks in that series. He was huge in that series.  I'm not even trying to start anything but Rockets fans love pretending like he didn't exist.  Dwight was one of the biggest reasons they won game 6, he had 20 points and 21 boards with 2 blocks."
Chris Paul is athletic he just short for the nba. He measured a 40‚Äù vert at the combine he dunked on Dwight Howard before &amp; he caught alley oops in the past 2 all star games even at his age
A Dwight Howard who can score anywhere is the end to LeBrons goat journey.
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"
He‚Äôs just turned 20 at the tail end of his rookie season and is essentially the league‚Äôs first prep-to-pro big with expectations since Dwight Howard. That matters  Getting reps at different levels matters. He‚Äôs where he was reasonably expected to be and is probably gonna be an all Rookie guy. Give the guy a full off-season of watching film with Kerr and a full training camp to install more offensive sets and he‚Äôs gonna be a contributor year 2 or 3
"&gt;  He's statistically a perfectly average rim protector. Nothing more.  He's not being asked to be.  That's what Anthony Davis is for.  Drummond is a wide body who will clog up the key and take the physical beating that Anthony Davis is desperately trying to avoid at center.  &gt;  He's also statistically an overrated rebounder. He grabs a lot but his teams don't rebound better with him on the court. Meaning he's mostly just gobbling up rebounds that teammates could have gotten anyway, and rebounding his own misses on offense.  While what you're saying is partially true here, it lacks context.  Drummond is an all time rebounder, and you really, really need to be pushing a slant otherwise.  Here's the context it's missing:  bench squads miss more shots.  There are more rebounds per 100 possessions to be had when bench squads are in.  So when Drummond goes out, Detroit's bench (which has actually had pretty solid rebounders over the years, if not really solid all around players) does a pretty decent job getting a similar number of rebounds per 100, but they actually don't rebound a better percentage.  &gt;  He's not useful catching lobs, he's statistically one of the worst finishers at the rim among centers.  These are two entirely different skill sets.  If you think LeBron James isn't going to have a laughably easy time throwing lobs to Drummond, you haven't watched either of them.  He's made some pretty mediocre centers into lob threats over the years, and while Drummond is poorly adapted to the modern NBA as a star, he's actually pretty well suited as a role player.  &gt;  He's useful enough setting screens, but that doesn't provide nearly enough value to offset what he costs your spacing and defense.  Oh he's definitely a net negative in terms of spacing.  But you have a stretch 4 who can offset some of this, and it's not like Dwight Howard or Javale McGee were providing any spacing in a similar role.  They both played excellent in their role for the Lakers, why not Drummond?  &gt;  The only aspect of Drummond's game that's actually valuable is his passing, both outlets in transition and post-passing.  Eh, he's a decent passer for a big and I've defended this before, but I'd just as soon have the ball in someone else's hands as much as possible in the starting lineup, and in Kuzma/Gasol's hands off the bench.  This is of course assuming they don't have Marc Gasol in the light minutes starting role with Drummond doing the Dwight thing of coming off the bench but playing heavy minutes (matchup dependent of course).  &gt;  Giving him post touches doesn't mean making him iso for a bucket. It means getting him the ball there and letting him make decisions.  If you're talking about high post, there is no coach in the NBA that would rather have Drummond get the ball in the high post that Gasol.  If you're talking about the low post, his decision making is problematic.  He does not have a polished post game or good foot work and is not very efficient this way.  He is at his best offensively when he's catching lobs after setting a screen, and when he's getting offensive rebounds for put backs.  You give him the ball in the low post, he's not so much making a decision, unless he makes a huge change from the last few years, he's just going to dive bomb the basket.  He passes pretty well out of the high post, not the low post, and for the high post quarterbacking they simply have a better option.  If he wants to be a net positive for the Lakers, his job is what Dwight's was.  Hustle, set screens, catch lobs, fight for boards.  He's not the defender that Dwight is, even at this age, but he is a better rebounder capable of playing more minutes at this point."
i mean he got bodied by Embiid other than that dunk but he destroyed Dwight Howard whos not exactly some bum on defense
"It's like Dwight Howard and screen fouls. I use to think it was bullshit, but after game after game of the same shit, from different ref crews, you have to accept reality. These aren't small sample sizes. Dwight is an aggressive screen setter and that often results in fouls, and Jokic is not good at drawing fouls."
Dwight Howard to. Dwight literally made an all-star game in Houston and outplayed Harden in a couple playoff series. And he played with Westbrook.
Bro I thought that was Dwight Howard
"And when cp3 had harden they led 3-2 against the durant warriors. It was only when cp3 got hurt they lost game 6 and game 7. Why is cp3 amongst the greatest? 4 time assist leader 6 time steals leader (most ever) 7 time first team all defence Career 18 points and 10 assists on 47/37/87  Was up 3-2 against the fucking greatest basketball team ever assembled and when he got hurt they went 0-27 from 3, so he was clearly playing his part.  Hope that answers your question. If I'm disrespectful to prime blake, then what the hell are you being right now?  And finally anyone who doesn't praise prime dwight howard is a moron... Although not really sure how that's relevant in the slightest lmao"
"Dwight Howard trade really killed their franchise. It's been almost 10 years man, crazy. What happens when you lose a generational talent, aren't a FA destination, make bad trades, &amp; don't hit in the draft."
Yeah I shouldn't have asked. You disrespectful asf to prime Blake. Hell Cap3 had Harden the 3rd best sg in NBA history.  Please stop Cap3 has underachieved.  Dwight Howard got a team to the Finals and nobody praises him. Why is Cap3 amongst the greatest?
Dwight Howard had a better career than Chris Paul and nobody praises him. CP3 is overrated!
"&gt;Greg Oden could‚Äôve been a more offensively skilled Dwight Howard  Oden never had the skill or athleticism of Howard.  This is like saying Talen Horton-Tucker could be a more offensively-skilled Michael Jordan... yeah, if he developed both way more skill and athleticism, sure."
And yet that's what Dwight Howard and then when we won the championship he was suddenly a ring chaser who we only got because we're the Lakers
Greg Oden could‚Äôve been a more offensively skilled Dwight Howard
Depends what the elite guard/big is. Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook? Dwight Howard or Nikola Jokic?
"Rudy Gay's first season was in 2006-2007. [Rudy Gay has the 14th most points since 2007, right behind Dwight Howard.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-points-scored-since-2007-season)"
"Well you‚Äôre assuming that Brown, Tatum, and the Knicks were saying the same things as Luka. It‚Äôs not inconsistent if they‚Äôre expressing their complaints differently. Players have mentioned that engaging with the refs in the right way is really important. At this point, Luka is tied with Russ and Draymond for second most technical fouls in the league with 11, only beaten by Dwight Howard. It‚Äôs possible some of these are just reputation, but for him to get to that point suggests there‚Äôs something more than just complaining."
Didn't he relentlessly bully Dwight Howard for not having won anything at the start of the decade?
"You can‚Äôt have it both ways,  I love Jokic.  He is the MVP right now.  If the refs treated him like Dwight Howard, he‚Äôd foul out in the first quarter.    Pick your poison."
Yeah I‚Äôm sure a post back injury Dwight Howard and a 33 year old CP is exactly who he wanted to play with all along. Curry was fortunate to be surrounded around one of the greatest teams of all time. You put Harden in for Curry  on those Warrior teams and they still win chips. You must‚Äôve forgot that Iggy won finals mvp and Draymond was on pace to win it in 2016. Harden has carried some shit teams to deep playoff runs while Curry can‚Äôt even crack the top 8 this year. Curry has no finals mvps because his team always stepped up when he was being contained. The warriors dynasty success should be largely contributed to Kerr putting Draymond in the starting line up to allow Curry to play off ball since the heavy workload was starting to hurt his ankles.   You act like Curry won those titles by himself when his team contributed more than he did to winning. Then KD came and showed he was the best player on that roster as well. Curry couldn‚Äôt even beat Kawhi and the raptors because he didn‚Äôt have KD to make the big shots.
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
"Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Klay Thompson"
"Bruh, Dwight Howard 100% ranks over Ben"
"So not even just his wingspan is the same as that of Dwight Howard and Kevin Garnett, but his actual height too."
You wont have dwight howard hugging jokic anymore. I think aaron gordon could potentially be your anti-lebron.  Nets... no chance. They are too fucking stacked.
"Refs generally are focused on enforcing two different sets of rules for ""in the post"" verse everywhere else.  The amount of physical play that is allowed in the post vs everywhere is why LMA, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard, et.cetera are minimum contract players.  If refs enforced the same set of rules... a lot of these players would get a lot more foul calls. Imagine all of the Harden touch fouls that happen... then compare that to what post players get away with when defending big men... it makes absolutely no sense."
"LMAO nice examples of good recent dunk contest, Dwight Howard from 13 years ago I guess fits in the recent category. Name some good dunk contest outside of Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in the last like 10 years. You can‚Äôt because the dunk contest has been absolute garbage because no name or fringe all star players compete in it. The dunk contest has been trash for years it became a joke when the jazz‚Äôs 13th man off the bench won it."
I dont know. We say that with a 15 year gap from Bens dominance and his narrative and legacy established. We don't know if Jokic will end up more a Chris Webber or Dwight Howard who were just as dominant as Ben but don't have the love or luck Ben had and don't get brought up as much as Ben.

"Giannis is a beast at center and have been playing it a lot recently, bobby portis hve been great to play the 4.   Brook isn't just a beast of rim protection anymore like last year. He only got the size and somewhat can space the floor  Imagine if player like gobert, Myles turner in this team or heck even Dwight Howard. 3-5 block per game easily"
the rebounds are debatable. I've seen Curry box out Dwight howard on multiple occasions. He also lead the league in steals. A rotation of Currys means he can afford to risk fouling out to poke the ball lose. Who do you guard if everyone involved can shoot from 30.
Reach out to Dwight Howard he‚Äôs my buddy. Lives in Philadelphia.
Dwight Howard might be of assistance
I would have loved to watch him punch Howard right in the face.  Dwight Howard for all of his god given gifts is a joke compared to Haslem.

"&gt; a slight overpay for a starting caliber center  It's an extreme overpay for a traditional big. Centers who don't shoot 3s and can't defend on the perimeter are of extremely limited value in today's NBA. If all you want is a big dude who can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots, there's no need to pay that kind of money to get a player like that. Look at what guys like Ivicia Zubac, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard or Nerlens Noel are making: combined they are making $8 million less than Steven Adams is making by himself this season."
"Sorry, no, that's a horrible deal for a traditional big like Steven Adams. If all he wanted was a big dude who can't shoot 3s or guard on the perimeter but can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots he could have got any number of guys who fit that description for dirt cheap and not had to waste any draft picks to get them. Go look at what Dwight Howard and Nerlens Noel signed for and you'll see that trading George Hill and a 1st round pick just so you could pay Steven Adams $66 million over the next 3 seasons was an insane overpay."
Dwight Howard or the Morris Twins
"Good list. Dwight Howard has to be up there. He was pretty dominant on the boards, especially in his Orlando years. Led the league in rebounds a couple of times. Honorable mention to KG and Tim Duncan."

"Yeah people were saying the Sixers were screwed long term with the Harris/Horford contracts. People were saying that one of Embiid/Simmons had to be traded and the Sixers needed to rebuild.   But the biggest change they made in that offseason (other than upgrading from one of the worst coaches in the league to a solid one) was that they got veteran level players to put next to Simmons/Embiid. Guys like Danny Green, Dwight Howard, George Hill, Seth Curry, etc.   I think the Celtics have the assets to do that if they choose to, I'm curious to see whether they'll decide to go that route or not. They have their core group of players now they need to trim some of the fat to build around Brown and Tatum. Maybe that involves trading Kemba, maybe that involves trading Smart, but there are moves out there that could change the outlook of the team and we still have the assets to do that."
Didn't he play with Dwight Howard? Didn't he play with CP3?
"I don't agree with that at all. Harden is a better scorer than Dame, a better playmaker and a better defender. I guess the only think that you could say is that Dame is a better shooter. Harden has also carried some insanely shitty teams to wins. Like that stretch a couple years ago when CP3, Tucker, RoCo and basically the whole Rockets roster was hurt and Harden went supernova and averaged 40+ ppg for a 30+ game stretch and singlehandedly kept the Rockets in the playoffs. Or in 16-17 when the Rockets 2nd best player was probably Capela or Eric Gordon and Harden still single-handedly carried them to 55 wins in the west. And he's done that so many times in his career.  But, regardless, I don't know how you can say Dame has elevated the Blazers in the playoffs. Since 2014 (his breakout season), the Blazers have lost in the 1st round four(!!!) times, including 2 sweeps and 2 gentleman's sweeps. Like did you missed all the shit Dame got in the media last playoffs for folding in the playoffs once again? In the other 2 years, he lost in the 2nd round and was swept by the Warriors in the conference finals. Whereas Harden, since 2014, has only lost in the 1st round once and made it to the conference finals twice. And its not like he had elite teammates either. In 14-15 when Harden made it to the conference finals, his 2nd best teammate was an over the hill Dwight Howard who only played half the season.  I don't think anyone would seriously consider Dame over Harden unless they were a big Harden hater or something. There's a reason Harden has been All-NBA First Team 6 times and a perennial MVP candidate while Dame has only made 1 First Team and has never really sniffed MVP."
Wait until you find out about Dwight Howard
"I was all for trading Jrue, one star teams don't win.  What superstar has been traded for pennies on the dollar in the past decade anyway?  Think about the returns for PG, Westbrook, AD, Holliday and other stars over the past decade and tell me which was embarrassingly one sided.  If anything you're more likely to be burned trading for a star like Dwight Howard or Russell Westbrook.   &gt; I also hope that Embiid and Simmons leave so they don‚Äôt sit there and 50 games a year and never actually compete for a chip  wut?"
Dwight Howard intensifies.
Oof that Pelicans roster... Is there any player you'd see playing minutes in the Finals? Maybe Bledsoe as an 8th man? Hernangomez to soak up time against a Dwight Howard?
"I‚Äôve noticed this a lot. I think part of it is how they look on camera (angles, comparison to other similarly built players, etc), and part of it is also that they‚Äôre so tall that their proportions just seem off. My friend saw Dwight Howard at UCLA in like 2012 and said he looked muscular but thin. Obviously Dwight looks like a monster on the court, especially back then."
"But he does fit though. Even 400 pound Shaq is still more mobile and nimble than Jokic. He is still faster than Gobert. I don't think you watched prime Shaq play basketball. He was one of the freakiest athletes to ever play in the NBA. When you talk about size, strength, agility, coordination, speed and power. He was was more coordinated than guys like Dwight Howard who was like 4 inches shorter and prob close to 100 pounds lighter."
"&gt;In a lot of ways, they're the blueprint for the 2015 Warriors with Bogut.  Warriors offense was outside - in focused. Magic was more traditional inside - out. Either Howard post with 4 guys on the 3pt line or a lot of pick n roll and mid range game from Hedo or Jameer as Dwight would roll to the basket for the lob or offensive rebound."
"I respect him as an all-star calibre player. I don't respect some parts of his fanbase though, who are already thinking that Gobert is much better than any version of players like Dwight Howard. I know recency bias is a thing, but come on."
"[Westbrook, KLove, and Dwight Howard](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2012.html) all had worthy seasons that year as well"
"magic dwight is like cavs lebron. they were both by the far the best on their team with the 2nd and so forth bests not being even close.  lakers dwight is like heat lebron. they both had some great teammates, lakers dwight unfortunately didn't last very long though.  lebron got MVP with his nobody Cav's and his somebody Heat's. so im not really sure what wade and bosh have to do with it. Howard has had kobe as a teammate and james harden. not at the same time obviously but if LBJ had those as teammates then everyone would call it a superteam. yet with howard i guess they a bunch of schmucks. lets just be real there are superteams and then there are teams that have LBJ. thats not me sucking his D but pointing out there just arent many teams that LBJ can go to where it wouldn't be called a superteam so may as well just call it a team that has LBJ."
"Reminds me a bit of the 2009 Magic roster in that sense. Mitchell is a much more dynamic and talented offensive threat than anyone on that Magic roster was, but the point is that having Howard as the ultimate defensive anchor allowed the front office and coaching staff to put together line-ups that would not have even sniffed the Finals without Dwight. How many other teams at that time could have done as well as that Magic team did with Hedo &amp; Rashard Lewis at the 3 &amp; 4?"
I don't agree with that - the Magic roster was perfectly constructed for Dwight Howard to blossom.    Surrounded him with All-star level 3 and D guys which left him to flourish and show off in the paint.
Even currently! No offense but aside from Tony Parker and Jermaine o Neal that‚Äôs an amazing run of current players that I consider worthy of this. Maybe Dwight Howard during the early 2010‚Äôs but this is spot on.
1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   2. Wilt Chamberlain   3. Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal   4. Bill Russell   5. Hakeem Olajuwon   6. Moses Malone   7. David Robinson   8. **Dwight Howard**  9. Patrick Ewing   10. George Mikan   I think that Jokic can finish 5/6 depending on how his career goes.

"This dude really said Kobe and CP3 had a chance to not work together lmao. Dude you really typed that out and didn‚Äôt see how dumb it sounded?   Your opinion doesn‚Äôt take into account the carry job he had to do because Nash was hurt and the chemistry issues. If you think Kobe playing all those minutes that season weren‚Äôt a direct result of the team sucking and in result caused him to get injuries then you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre taking about.   A super team where a 38 year old Nash played 50 games, Dwight Howard refused to run the pick n roll with Nash, Gasol played 49 games, and Dwight wasn‚Äôt healthy all season. But yea let‚Äôs not add context to the team. Chris Paul that season played 70 games. Pretty sure he would have prevented Kobe from playing all those minutes do to a lack of another ball handler.   We assume Kobe would not be playing 39 MPG the last 25 games because we would have had CP3 playing and not have Steve Nash who only played 50 games and was never healthy. Like how do you not get that?   I literally asked you why Kobe got injured. You side stepped the question by sayin ‚Äúhe played a highly physical sport‚Äù. No shit Sherlock. You can say that about any injury. I asked you to contextualiza why he got injuries and you got butt hurt and refused to answer it.   I told you I don‚Äôt go through peoples comments, I still haven‚Äôt searched for that comment. All you had to do was say the context or even link the comment but you just refuse to admit that you didn‚Äôt want to add context because it would destroy your opinion. And sure buddy I‚Äôm the one with low emotional IQ. I‚Äôm the one that got mad and lied about it lol.   It‚Äôs not rehashing when you are replying. You could have literally linked the comment if you didn‚Äôt want to type it out but you wanted to get butt hurt and throw insults. Says a lot about you honestly"
"kareem and hakeem were far more skilled. shaq had plenty of skill compared to the other bigs in the 2000s but after the 1998 lockout there was a drastic decline in the bigs with the older guys aging and retiring. shaq dominated comparatively weak competition by being fatter than them. he couldn't match hakeem in skill so he got fat to out power opponents. kareem was the best scoring big ever and hakeem was the best overall big ever imo. kareem's length and touch especially with his sky hook and his bbiq made him amazing on offense. he was slow which hurt him in aspects particularly defensively but there were not many gaurds at the time that could take advantage pf that. hakeem while not as good of a shooter didn't have the weaknesses kareem and shaq had. hakeem was truly well rounded and outperformed both on the defensive end and was one of if not the best shot blocker in nba history. he was all around better than shaq. hakeem was better all around except he didn't have the teammates kareem and shaq had. while people hate this comparison because they undervalue dwight, young shaq was basically dwight howard. the real difference was shaq left the magic earlier, got fat, and had better teammates in his prime. and shaq had better footwork but only really because he had started in an era it was moor important, shaq's footwork was still not that good compared to the guys in kareem and hakeem's primes. shaq got by more on athleticism and then being fat and bullying guys inside."
"I think that's overstating it a bit for the Eastern Conference. Definitely more true in the West at that time though.  -  Eastern Conference centers in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Joakim Noah * Miami: Joel Anthony * Boston: Jermaine O'Neal * Orlando: Dwight Howard * Atlanta: Al Horford * New York: Amare Stoudemire * Philadelphia: Elton Brand * Indiana: Roy Hibbert  -  Eastern Conference small forward in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Luol Deng  * Miami: LeBron James * Boston: Paul Pierce * Orlando: Hedo Turkoglu * Atlanta: Josh Smith * New York: Carmelo Anthony * Philadelphia: Andre Iguodala * Indiana: Danny Granger  -  The centers are hit-or-miss, but the SFs are absolutely stacked."

"I live in North Florida.  Dwight Howard tricked me into becoming a huge Magic fan during college.  Then he dumped me like he did the Magic, and now the Magic and I still get together from time to time and watch Dwight prime time highlights (no frosted tips allowed)"
"I just look at Luka‚Äôs production similar to how I would look at Harden‚Äôs. Harden played with Dwight Howard and barely got triple doubles, the next year Howard was gone and Harden had the most triple doubles in a season for his career, than Capela started playing a bigger role and his triple doubles went from in the 20‚Äôs to around 5.   And I think Luka has the best shot out of all current players to accomplish this as well. However when you say ‚Äúinjuries can screw over any player‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt really work against Westbrook who is 32 and just set the record. Luka needs to stay healthy to break the record, Westbrook already has it. However if Westbrook can stay healthy he can likely smash the record"
"wait you mean Grant Williams right? I assume Robert Williams will be starting. if by chance u mean Grant, I don't really see that working out. From what I've seen, he's really not that great of a player. Y'all definitely should try to avoid playing an undersized center rotation for yet another year especially considering you play in the conference with Joel Embiid, Giannis, and Bam all playing on top eastern conference teams... I think you guys need another real big (look how dwight howard has done wonders for the Sixers this year, a backup center that is essentially a starting quality big is extremely important for a successful team IMO). I think you guys should sign someone like Dwight Howard(although, as I Sixers fan, I hope we re-sign him), Javale McGee, Richaun Holmes, or Nerlens Noel"
"You say any team could have signed them, but they where always going to take LA's offer over any small markets offer.   Also you're still not accounting for stars the force their way out to larger markets. AD, Dwight Howard (2012), KG, KAJ, Wilt, Kyrie, Marbury, CP3."
"Dwight Howard was a pretty big acquisition at the time.  Also, LeBron+Shaq are probably 2 of the biggest names you could've acquired in those eras lol.  Then there's guys like AD requesting to go to LA which isn't the same as FA but still matters.  No all-star FA or player forcing a trade ever said ""I wanna go to Toronto or another small market city"""
"Didn't the Lakers just win a Championship by signing Dwight Howard, Rondo, Danny Green, and Javale McGee? Also while not in free agency, when a star forces a trade, they always request to be traded to a large market."
Find the opposite to be true. Athletic players tend to over-rely on that trait and don‚Äôt develop the fundamental abilities that carry them into old age with grace. Tim Duncan &amp; Karl Malone vs Blake Griffin or Dwight Howard.
The Knicks' sustained success.   Danny Green and Dwight Howard not being washed.   All the heat transactions.   Magic actually blowing it up.
Dwight Howard deserved MVP in 2011
1. Saying this ignores the fact that two of those rings were won with a guy named Kevin Durant who won both Finals MVPs so Curry didn‚Äôt take them anywhere. That was the literal definition of a team effort.   2. If you tell me who was comparable to Klay and Dray on the 2015 Rockets I‚Äôd agree with you. If you say Dwight Howard who had a torn MCL and came off of a serious back surgery and was basically exiled from the Lakers by Kobe then i hope you‚Äôll understand why comparing the two teams is ridiculous.
&gt; **Technical fouls** - Dwight Howard and Luka Doncic (**16**)  No. Not ... yet.
"Yeah. I mean, I love to hate on Dwight Howard, but even he might be able to show giannis some things. Hopefully giannis can at least be a Howard level when he‚Äôs Howard‚Äôs age. Also hopefully giannis will be a great shooter by that stage.  Good shit tho. Always rooting for y‚Äôall cuz of coach bud and giannis is so easy to root for. Even last night cuz I‚Äôd rather have a better pick than play one play in game were prob gonna lose lol."
"Remember when Dwight Howard was a Wizard for like 2 weeks?   I barely do, and sometimes I just chalk it up to a fever dream"

"Giannis, jokic, kd, Duncan, prime dwight howard. Jokic pg, kd sg, giannis sf, duncan pf, dwight center"
"50% of LeBron coming to the Lakers probably does have to do with LA but the other 50% has to do with Magic and Rob convincing him. There is no way LeBron comes to the Lakers if Jim Dumbass Buss and Mitch Kupchak were still running shit. From 2013-2016 they struck out on every big name free agent (Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron who they were going after in 2014, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and Kevin Durant didn't even wanna give them a meeting in 2016). Magic and Rob changed the FO culture and just in time too or else we wouldn't have LeBron and AD"
Did Dwight Howard benefit from going to the Lakers or was it a bad look for him.
And Dwight Howard
"We had a decade span where we had 3 all-time terrible FT shooters having large roles in their teams in Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond. All 3 of them were kinda competing for those terrible FT records. I'm pretty sure they've changed the rules so its harder for them to rack up FTs like that, and I don't think we're gonna have any players be as consistently terrible at FTs as them in the future. Pretty safe record tbh."
What else should we look at? No one makes the argument that Dwight Howard is a better rebounder than Wilt because they like the way his rebounds look more.
"Carmelo is a huge part of the blazers despite coming off the bench. Probably at least the third most important on the team. Sometimes even the most important if he‚Äôs hot. Look at D Rose, Jordan Clarkson, Dwight Howard. Just cuz you don‚Äôt start doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt crucial."
Dwight Howard
We should have not let Dwight Howard walk away for nothing
its not even about scoring its personel. it sucks when an opposing team can send 2-3 players to drain a players energy. like having a dwight howard come off the bench.  young lebron gassed out when he was on the cavs. people said he had no 4th.
Yea I‚Äôm sure that Dwight Howard was out there putting up enough points to take out a prime deandre Blake and cp3
What an extreme. No one expects him to be anywhere near curry. People want him to take shots when he's wide open. Like actually try. Not hard to at least attempt some. Dwight Howard shoots more threes than him.
"Tell the truth: You said the same stuff about Dwight Howard all last year, didn't you?  I don't understand why Lakers fans hate on their own players so much.   Drummond was shooting with a player on the ground under his feet, who was trying to trip him, which is a super dangerous situation. NBA players often miss those layups.  He played well in the first quarter. He was part of the reason the Lakers jumped to an early lead."
"To be honest I rather have Cousins than Drummond. Would also rather have Dwight Howard, McGee, Myers Leonard over Drummond. We fucked up with that signing."
For real lmao fuckin Dwight Howard is shooting more 3s than Simmons... there‚Äôs a huge middle ground between Simmons and Curry in terms of shooting 3s lol
Drummond picks up fouls like vintage 2020 Dwight Howard
The chances of you being invited to a party are lower than Simmons hitting 5 threes a season as well. No need to be salty about the fact that your point guard hit less threes than Dwight Howard this season.
"Man this brings back so many memories of ""Rondo is trash"", ""Kuzma is trash"", ""Dwight Howard Lol!"".  I guess we'll find out."
Wiggins was supposed to be the next kobe.   Anyway dwight howard became what the bulls thought Tyson Chandler would be in 01
Right. I'm trolling because I said JaVale McGee isn't good and that Marc Gasol is a better player than Dwight Howard who has a -13 net rating on your team  ‚úåÔ∏è
It's because he's trash I admit I got fooled by his stats too but I never actually watched the guy play until he made it to LA he has all the problems Dwight Howard did but not near talent
"Yeah agreed, while the Sixers could have used Lowry the required price due to salary matching and assets was STEEP. And arguably would have left the Sixers in a more of a risky place.   To get Lowry they would have needed to trade Danny Green, and let‚Äôs assume the Raptors would take Maxey and not Thybulle. Sixers would still need to add 8m worth of salary, which means trading Mike Scott AND 2/3 of Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, &amp; Shake Milton. Which cuts into their already not exceptionally deep rotation. And then asking for a FRP plus another second? That‚Äôs an absurd price to pay and leaves your roster extremely vulnerable to injuries come playoff time.   Asking for picks and a young player is a fair price for Lowry, but in the Sixers case the salary matching requirements would have cut too deep into their rotation IMO to be worth it. And might have harmed them as much as Lowry could have helped them come playoff time. Not to mention the commitment of future money to an older player required with Lowry, the loss of picks that could replenish that depleted bench roster, &amp; the issue of roster space for the Raptors (even losing TD2 and Matt Thomas would Have left us needing one more roster spot).  Deal would have been tough, and might not have helped the Sixers as much as originally hoped."
Nah shaq was a force. Shit embiid hasnt even proven he can be dwight howard
I remember an announcer saying that Dwight Howard shot 90+% in practice and it blew my mind.
Dwight Howard with the ugliest hair in the NBA
Dwight Howard and George hill really killed this game with the 2nd unit lmao
Dwight Howard seems like a fun dude
Dwight Howard is -14 tonight. Embiid can‚Äôt even catch his breath before the second unit screws it up.
Dwight Howard is a straight liability on the floor tonight.
It‚Äôs really disorienting once you notice that Dwight Howard actually isn‚Äôt that tall lol
Dwight Howard isnt a great defender anymore
"Bro Dwight Howard is gonna be the reason the Hawks come back, that dude is not even trying to rebound"
It's crazy to have Dwight Howard more reliable to shoot free throws than your point guard.
Dwight Howard looks like a pineapple/Sebastian the fish from little mermaid
Replaced Rondo and Danny Green and Dwight Howard and Javale McGee with Schroeder and Gasol.
"Locks Based of Classic Qualifiers: Dwight Howard, Lebron, Melo, CP3, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Giannis, Curry, Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Jokic  Probable Based on the Same Qualifiers: Lowry, Rondo, Irving ,Dame, Klay, Draymond, PG13, Gobert, Anthony Davis  Future: Luka, Trae, Spida, Booker, Embiid, KAT, Jammal Murray, Jah Morant, Tatum"
Dwight Howard just fouled Gallinari's ass with his dick
‚ÄúDwight Howard has never committed a foul.‚Äù  - Dwight Howard
Our daily reminder that all refs hate Dwight howard
Every time I see Dwight Howard I think of Josh Smith. Mainly because its all the Hawks talked about when the Magic and Hawks played back in the day.  It's weird to see Dwight still playing while J-Smoove is probably playing pick up games in Guatemala somewhere.
That play perfectly encapsulates what I think about Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard out here looking like my Troll Warrior in World of Warcraft lmao
I like that Dwight Howard has finally embraced his role as a villain.
Why does Dwight Howard want to look like a rooster üêî
Dwight Howard looks like an actual crackhead
"Dwight Howard cracks me up so much on the sideline, he goes to the bench and puts on a tank top that‚Äôs literally smaller than his jersey lmao"
We were trying to sign Dwight Howard in FA
"You are seeing Giannis slander because he has those accolades with a very unpolished/sloppy skill set.  Personally, it reminds me of prime Dwight Howard. Coasting on athleticism."
Dwight Howard is extremely religious and when he was in Orlando he said he wanted the Cross added to the NBA logo.  He has 5 children with 5 different women.   Athletes cheat and being religious isn't really an inhibitor.
Heads in the sand effect.  I had Dwight Howard.  I know smoke when I see it.  And that‚Äôs with a finals run and a team built to his strengths.
"The only difference between Thanasis and Giannis is a green light. Giannis has, at best, the basketball skills of an 18 year old Dwight Howard"
"In terms of volume I think July 12 2013 is up there above this. ‚ÄúThat‚Äù trade between Celtics and Nets, then the Jrue trade from Philly to Pelicans. Apparently 1/3rd of the draft picks were moved during that draft.    Next day, practically within 24 hours as draft is done in the night, Dwight Howard signed for the Rockets."
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
"That‚Äôs not how physics work at all lol. Everything from the feet up is completely different. KD is freakishly compact for his skill (even though he‚Äôs lanky as hell). His wingspan isn‚Äôt really absurd to his frame. Like Gobert looks like a damn octopus. Giannis carries WAY more muscle, like Dwight Howard. It‚Äôs hard to get a soft touch with that."
First Charlotte ROY since Emeka Okafor.   Who beat Dwight Howard for the honor.   I'll take this little piece of happiness in a severly underwhelming end of our season.   Lets see if we can finally get a solid big man
"KD didn‚Äôt have anyone super physical guarding him.  Meanwhile Butler was driving against LeBron, AD, Dwight Howard, etc all game."
He might as well be an evolved version of Dwight Howard. Not that it's a bad thing but that potential was there for Dwight and he never really tapped into it despite all his DPOYs and stuff.
&gt; There‚Äôs a long list of guys who you‚Äôd rather have on your team at the end of a close playoff game at this point.  Dwight Howard?
"This guy thinks his Tim Duncan... Just like Dwight Howard back then when he was with LA. Keeps shooting mid range, fade aways instead of just going to the basket."
Remember when Dwight Howard guarded Kobe
Dwight Howard comes out as gay and he's secretly been getting topped by Matisse
"The majority of football and basketball players? What are you talking about? I looked up your claims and could only find ""EX-player qanon beliefs"" oh and Dwight Howard.   Qanon beliefs don't make up the majority of any population because they're so wack."
"I don't think Philly fans really realize what it says about their locker room that Dwight Howard is some sort of glue guy. Must be the largest group of herbs and dorks the league has ever assembled. He's been absolutely reviled everywhere he goes, wildly regarded as an insufferable douchebag, but magically turns a leaf on the Sixers? lol riiiiighhhht"
Imagine what CP3 would have done with Kobe and Dwight Howard.....
"I think it will age very well, but redefine.  Giannis at age 30 in a small ball era at center could be Dwight Howard esque... Pre back injury"
"I'd disagree with that, but I can see why you make that case. Having Gobert definitely changes the way they play defensively, but he has almost no impact on the other side. You can't go to him like you could, say, prime Dwight Howard on the Magic and have him give you 25.  If you don't have Donovan Mitchell I just don't know if they have the same trajectory as they had the last couple of years, which lead them to being the number 1 seed in the whole league.  Regardless of all of that, I think we can both agree he should've been All-NBA."
"I've seen every bit of tape on Wilt that has been uploaded and I've rewatched it several times. He's about as overrated as it gets. The 48% FT shooting doesn't lie.  There's a full game 1970 game 7 NBA finals where he basically played an average Dwight Howard game (1 for 11 FTs). Even Shaq was more clutch at the line in the playoffs. In the previous game Wilt went off but nobody has tape of it. In the biggest games of the year, his performance is a crapshoot. Not the kind of consistent value you want on the court game in and game out compared to other greats. Overrated."
"this is a ridiculous take, embiid at his worst is way better than 28 minutes of dwight howard fouling out and then playing with no center at all."
Dwight Howard vibes
Dwight Howard
"right, looking like his career could go more the way of a dwight howard atm. he's got a lot of time though"
"He fouled out vs Dwight Howard.  He‚Äôs a pretty bad rebounder and gets beaten out by the rim runner type in addition to being embiids son.  If getting lots of blocks is your qualification for being a great defender, maybe you should also sign Hassan whiteside.  There‚Äôs a reason that he was offered free of charge to Boston and they turned him down. He‚Äôs not worth his contract whatsoever."
Do you take prime Dwight Howard or Giannis?
Slender Dwight Howard
Giannis is a lanky Dwight Howard
Giannis is just a lankier Dwight Howard
"Who you guys taking, Dwight Howard in his prime on the Magic or Giannis??"
Giannis is prime Dwight Howard 2.0.
Is Giannis a nicer version of Dwight Howard?!
No you can't jump. However you can actually move back further behind the line (I think Dwight Howard has done this).
"The Nets have to try to win without Harden playing. It has been done before that resting a Harden who clearly isn't in the best shape to play worked better for the team.  Remember the 2015 Rockets, down 3-2 in the series against LOB City Clippers, were down by 20+ points in the 3rd quarter. McHale, who wasn't a good coach, rested Harden, and Josh Smith, Jason Terry, and non-Dwight Howard players went on to come back against the Clippers, in Staples Center, to win that game.  Nets have to take that chance, especially with Bud as the opponent's head coach."
Dwight Howard has a pretty high IQ defensively though
"but then he'd have Dwight Howard in his locker room, and that isn't worth it"
LeGM shoulda paid Dwight Howard the amount of skittles he required.
"Yes. At some point in time, a player must develop. You mentioned Donovan Mitchell. He was the #13 pick in his draft class. If he never improves from this year, you take a #13 overall pick leading you at least once to the #1 seed in the West and taking you to at least the second round of the playoffs as your best player. For the #1 overall pick? No.   What's alarming about Ben is his lack of progress. This is his fourth year playing (fifth year overall.) Played 58 regular season games and now nine playoff games. Has made THREE 3-ptrs all year. For reference, Dwight Howard has made more this season. Simmons ceiling, as of right now, is being the #3 option on a conference finals contender or a #4 option on a legit threat to win it all. That's not what you draft players #1 overall for."
"He has to be in the perfect situation to be good, but - Dwight Howard"
"Pick up games. Bruh  Why do you think Dwight Howard or Dikembe never developed a floater? Just doesn‚Äôt work for some guys, especially the super muscly ones for whatever reason"
14/12 and great defense.  Shit give me Dwight Howard on the vet min who can give you half those stats in 12 minutes coming off the bench.  I like Rudy but he is overpaid and that is a understatement.
He's done a lot that Booker hasn't done... I love Booker but there is absolutely no shame in Tatum being the X best player in the league and Booker being the X minus 3 best player in the league.  They're both still young and still have a lot of potential to grow. This feels like when people tried to debate LeBron versus Dwight Howard back in 08 or 09 - they're different players that are both really good and really desirable and it can be left at that without the world exploding
It's kinda crazy to think that Coach Bud maybe fired this off-season.   Dude was a great coach in Atlanta. His first year in Atlanta yeah we had a losing record but we had a fuck ton of injuries that year if I remember correctly. We still made the playoffs and gave the #1 Seed Indiana Pacers a run for their money  and I was hyped for the following year and I was right. The following we had the 60 win season and got 4 players to the All-Star game and a 17-0 January run which put all 5 starters as players of the months. And we made it to the Eastern Conference Finals. Got swept but still ECF.  To be quite honest it was headed to a bright future with Coach Bud as our HC and Danny Ferry as the GM. Danny Ferry traded away Joe Johnson and Marvin Williams and their huge contracts.   And then the emails and convo leaks happened which featured Danny Ferry said Loul Deng having a little African in him which was supposedly written in a scouting report and not directly from ferry.   Either ways that lead to Ferry ouster which didn't favor the fan base. Coach Bud took over as President and made some bad moves like getting Dwight Howard. And new ownership brought in Travis Schlenk and started the Tank. And coach Bud left cause he wanted to coach with a contender. Funny one was Dennis Schroeder think he's an alpha and he requested to be traded.   It does make me wonder had Schroeder never left would we have stuck with Luka and not traded for Trae.   So I wasn't surprised when Milwaukee exploded under Coach Bud which included Giannis winning back to back MVPs. But to get to this stage man. Kinda crazy how coach Bud went.
"&gt;PG claimed he was not the father and will not take responsibility as long as the DNA test confirms he is.   Ah yes, the ultimate sign of not taking responsibility for a kid is when you marry the mom. What a deadbeat.  If only PG could be more responsible, like Shawn Kemp or Dwight Howard or Calvin Murphy.  BTW - the whole ""he initially wanted her to get an abortion"" is fairly meaningless, in terms of him being a good father or not. A fetus != a child - especially when it ain't his belly that it's growing in. Oxytocin levels don't spike in dads during pregnancy like they do in moms (I'm not sure what they do in non-carrying female partners). Dad's level spikes after birth, as he bonds with the child."
"That it was. People have repressed the ‚ÄúMike Budenholzer, President of Basketball Operations‚Äù time period that led to the Dwight Howard and Schroder contracts.  Schlenk came in and immediately hit on Collins, then drafted Trae and Huerter in 2018, Dre and Cam in 2019."
Dwight Howard was playing better. I don't understand why Embiid was back in the game.
My only officiating question is what happened with the Dwight Howard loose ball foul when Collins got the accidental elbow? The PA announcer said they were reviewing to see if a hostile act took place. In my understanding you can give a flagrant or technical in that situation based on replay but not a regular loose ball foul which is what they did. The only way it makes sense is if they were determining if the foul happened before the shot clock expired. That‚Äôs not what they said they were doing though.
"This Rudy Gobert love is weirdest thing on this sub. It‚Äôs not even debatable who the best player is. Do people do it to show they‚Äôre smart or something?  We are literally doubling/trapping Mitchell every time down the floor, and leaving anybody to guard Gobert. We‚Äôre barely playing our Center and he still can‚Äôt score.   On offense our small ball is putting him in rotation and foul trouble, he can‚Äôt live with the drive and kick threes. Yes he‚Äôs an elite rim-protector but calling one your best player is asinine. He‚Äôs not Dwight Howard, who was a focal point of a championship contender."
"It‚Äôs a weird night when subbing out a 35 year old Dwight Howard for the MVP runner up with 7 minutes left in the game becomes a bad decision. Real talk though, I loved how Dwight was playing, the past couple years he‚Äôs played with so much humbleness and heart"
Steve Nash hasn‚Äôt shown to be that smart. Steve Kerr would have done that in game 3 and 4. That‚Äôs what he did to shut down Dwight Howard and Clint Capela against Houston
Prime Dwight Howard &gt;&gt;&gt; Rudy Gobert
Rudy is a poorman's Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard with a four point play instead of Simmons
"Huh??? The 76ers depth features Dwight Howard, maxey, and the recent discovery of shake Milton lmao"

Dwight Howard is the only  person with that haircut that I'll take seriously.
https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/dwight-howard-trans-woman-sexual-harassment-allegations-617438/  I apologize for using the wrong pronouns.
"ppl talkin ""oh how much trae spend to keep his hair hurr durr"" when really he probably doesn't pay shit, meanwhile dwight howard out here spending $250 a clip at the salon to have noodles on his head"
Does Dwight Howard purposely try to look like an unfunny clown?
Dwight Howard just caught a guy in the face with an elbow. Common foul.
"Dwight Howard violently stood there, boxing out, in good position"
Fuck Dwight Howard
Does anybody know why Dwight Howard has a sea sponge on his head?
Fuck dwight howard lmao
Fk Dwight Howard
"Dwight ""Nikola"" Howard"
Dwight is howard
"Sounds like they are saying ""Yuck Dwight Howard""? Weird chant /s"

dwight howard reaching heights that drake can not reach
Ben head taps dwights chest  ESPN: Simmons head butts teammate Dwight Howard out of frustration
Blocking shots after the play ends always makes me think about AI's shot over Dwight Howard though lol
"I think he gets disrespect BECAUSE of his skill level. He's a great guy, but he is where he is because of his superhero body. Dwight Howard didn't get top level respect either. DRob even caught disrespect, and he's probably the most comparable player to Giannis ever. Guys who are seen as succeeding based on raw athletecism and size face an uphill battle to prove their skill."
Dwight Howard. Just to see him flex from the sidelines alone is worth it. Great rim protection is a bonus.
"&gt;2012 maybe  Kendrick Perkins has openly talked about how Harden sucked because he was going to strip clubs in Miami during the finals  &gt;2013 no  Went from shooting 44/37/85 in the regular season to 39/34/80 in the playoffs. **Also went 4/12 with 10 turnovers in their first elimination game vs OKC** (game 4) but the series got extended because he got saved by chandler parsons lol. In the elimination game they lost (game 6) he went 7/22 with 4 turnovers  &gt;2014 no  Went from shooting 46/37/87 in the regular season to 38/30/90 in the playoffs. Elimination game Harden strikes again. Rockets have a lead going into the 4th quarter, down 3-2 to the blazers. Harden scores 2 points on 1/4 shooting with 0 assists while playing nearly the entire quarter (9:21). 2nd year Lillard ends their season, despite a dominant series by Dwight Howard for the rockets  &gt;2015 I guess  Down 17 at the end of the 3rd quarter in an elimination game to the Clippers while down 3-2 in the series (he was shooting 5/20), then he gets benched and saved by Josh Smith and Corey Brewer. Follows it up with another classic elimination game harden performance vs GS next round, shooting 2/11 with 12 turnovers in the final game of their 4-1 loss. **You guess?? seems pretty clear this is a huge choke**  &gt;2016 no  went from averaging 29 PPG on 44/36/86 in the regular season to 27 PPG on 41/31/84 in the playoffs. Lost in 5 to the Curry-less Warriors and got outplayed by Klay. Maybe underperformance fits better for this year than choke. My bad.  &gt;2017 yes  reminder that he lost by 39 to the Spurs missing Kawhi and Tony Parker in game 6 while shooting 2/11 with 6 turnovers  &gt;2018 debatable  Game 6: **Leading by 17 at the end of the 1st quarter and 10 at halftime. Ends up losing by 29**. 0 points on 0/2 shooting with 2 turnovers in the 4th quarter (they were only down by 7 going into the 4th quarter)  Game 7: Another blown double digit halftime lead. Harden missed 10 straight 3s.   &gt;2020 no  4/15 with 4 turnovers in game 7 vs OKC. In the 4th quarter of the lakers series he scored 5, 5, 5, 6, and 3 points; including game 3 with the series tied and game tied entering the 4th, where Harden shot 1/4 with 1 assist in 9 minutes  &gt;2021 no  Like I said, you can use the injury as an excuse for this year but he still went 5/17 on FGs and 2/12 from 3 in game 7"
"MJ fused with Rodman would be great and dead by 28.  Other historical nominees:  Draymond and KD, KG and Ray Allen (basically KG with Ray Allen‚Äôs jumper would be unfuckwitable; surprised I haven‚Äôt seen this), West and Wilt, Stockton and Malone (Stock‚Äôs toughness makes up for Malone being a little bitch), Isiah and Rodman.  Other interesting ones: AI and Dikembe, Payton and Schrempf, Kidd and Vince Carter, Duncan and Steve Kerr, Dwight Howard and Hedo Turkoglu."
Who has a higher basketball IQ  Daniel Theis  Or Dwight Howard
I think it‚Äôs more the icing on the cake than the reason though.  Dwight Howard never got the criticisms Giannis does and he was a worse version of Giannis back in his prime.
"key word is ""average"" hs/college player. there's a lot of guys there almost purely based on their size. tall guys who can barely catch the ball. nba players also have skills they probably will never really showcase in a game - like Dwight Howard shooting 82% in practice. Giannis probably shoots 40% from high school 3.  Speaking of Giannis/Howard/Magic - I used the Howard comparison due to the same usage of size/strength rather than skill to score. Giannis is a more advanced playmaker, but he's similar to Howard in that sense in that it's primarily based on the attention of a double team/help defense. Magic made something out of nothing."
"Cool to brag about acting in bad faith lol?   It‚Äôs really not that hard   2009:  LBJ, Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant you could make arguments for more people also Kobe was 31 and his numbers were dipping and his defense was getting a lot worse   2010:   LBJ, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, and again Dwight Howard   I‚Äôm not even sure this is a discussion unless your argument is Kobe is better because he was popular? He was contributing less than these guys that‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of he was top 5 both years, but not top 3, which is a criteria you created"
&gt; Dwight Howard gifted those accolades to them.  Rashard averaged a super efficient 20 ppg for like 5 years in Seattle lol
"""for his size"". but his ball handling is objectively... mediocre. All his points are dunks/layups, with a few hooks or fadeaways peppered in.  Even the worst NBA player is ridiculously skilled compared to average hs/college player, but Harden is really taking about within the context of the NBA. I would say Giannis is probably in the 25% percentile in terms of ""skill"". Which is fine. Dwight Howard is even less skilled but almost won the mvp. Goes to show how much length +athleticism+effort matters as well."
"You can say this about literally every player  Maybe Wiseman turns it around, he's young and has potential. But if you're considering Dwight Howard as a realistic possibility for him then I'm gonna say Chuma Okeke could be Carmelo Anthony"
"Media &amp; r/NBA on Dwight Howard incognito at an NBA playoff game after getting eliminated:   &gt;""WHAT A SCRUB LOSER!""      LeBron dressed flashy as fuck (like $200k just in the diamond necklaces) to make sure the world knows he's there  with a bottle of his own tequila in a very visible location after losing in three guest round:   &gt;""LeBron is so cool"""
"Dwight Howard gifted those accolades to them.  You say super hot from three, I think most people see it as doing what the roster was constructed to do.  4 shooters out bombing outside shots with Howard in the middle.  IIRC this was the first time this play style was used so prominently and effectively over a long term.  ===========================*  Much like LeBron James in his first Cleveland stint.  Mo Williams was an All star but come on now.  Lol, Antwan Jamison?  Ilgauskas?  Illegitimate all star.  Ilgauskas team before LBJ had the 3rd worst record in team history while in a one of the weakest conferences and divisions ever.  LBJ propped up a washed Ilgauskas for years."
"I don't think people really understand what our weaknesses were. Lowry would still have to operate with Embiid in a crowded half court. The PG iniating the offense would've gotten us past the Hawks that's for sure, but our team with a C, two forwards who don't shoot, and Seth would make Lowry's life difficult. I love the guy and I think it would've helped our team a lot but it's silly to think our salvation lies in a 36 year old PG. We have bigger issues and with how the Bucks/Suns are playing a ""ring"" is pretty silly to think about with this group.  Lowry could've gotten us up 20 every game, if Doc is still using Dwight howard all bench lineups I seriously doubt we push any elite team in the playoffs"
I obviously don‚Äôt remember early Dwight that well but I‚Äôve watched a lot of wiseman and what I can remember about early Howard doesn‚Äôt really match with Wiseman very well. No hate on Wiseman because he‚Äôs still a kid but he‚Äôs really far from contributing at a high level. Dwight was a good player from the start.
People really don‚Äôt understand how good Dwight Howard was in his prime smh
"Jeff Green, Ariza, (old) Dwight Howard, George Hill are all in the same boat here   Every team loves the idea of having them, but they are obviously still ~low to mid tier role players. Which means no long term role and new interest from teams"
The very premise of the question underrates peak Dwight Howard.
He makes 23m  year and he puts up 7 and 9  You can get dwight Howard for the minimum
"Mysogyny and homophobia. That whole Dwight Howard saga was so depressing, people still make jokes about it."
"Peak Shaq (99-2000 season) was in great shape, a phenomenal athlete, and had several offensive moves in the low post. Peak Dwight Howard might be the better comparison.  However, I don't believe we've seen peak Gianni's yet. Crazy as that sounds."
"Yes, because the NBA went through and required each player to be measured and listed at their actual height.  He measured at 6‚Äô9 [here‚Äôs an article ](https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard)"
Why wasn't Dwight Howard bought in tho I like him more than javale
"If not for Stan Van Gundy trusting him with the ball and Dwight Howard who got all of their backs, Hedo is just an OK player. When he went to PHX and Toronto, he was reduced to nothing"
"In no particular order  1.Jordan 2.Lebron  3.Wilt 4.Hakeem 5.Russell 6.Barkley  7.Kobe 8.Shaq  9.Dirk 10.Duncan 11.Pippen 12.Giannis 13.Karl Malone 14.Robinson 15.KD 16.Chris Paul 17.Bird 18.Magic 19.Kareem 20.Kawhi 21.D-wade 22.Jerry West 23.Steph 24.Stockton 25.Dwight Howard 26.Big O 27.Harden 28.KG 29.Nash 30.AI  I probably missed some, but Ginobli, while certainly a very good player is nowhere near the top 30 players of all time. Man had two top 10 MVP finishes. He averaged 13/4/3.5. There are at least 40-50 guys ahead."
And Dwight Howard
"When you have the chance to get DWill and Dwight Howard, you gotta let go of your proven championship anchor center who went on to win a DPOY to do it."
Give Dwight Howard a spin.
Honestly they should just try and get Javale McGee back or go get Dwight Howard
"Hell, it wouldn't have been a total loss had the Mavs actually picked Olynyk for themselves instead of for Boston. Somehow Cuban managed to skip over two worthwhile players, one an MVP the other a stretch big, just to save cap space for Dwight Howard who never came."
All to free up a bit more cap space for Dwight Howard IIRC.  Cuban always thinks he's being so smart while doing stupid shit.
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
"I actually miss him in the Lakers. Marc is good but Dwight brings that energy off the bench, even with his age. Part of the Lakers 2020 success is the fastbreak points by the bigs. Javale and Dwight running the floor gave them easy baskets.   Marc is better in the half court offense. I do want to see them mix it up and have both Gasol and Howard though"
"I remember a few years ago when analysts and fans were all on the ""Giannis is the best player in the NBA"" narrative. It didn't last long but it was out there. It happens every few years with different players.  I don't understand how you are writing LeBron off. He literally just won a championship. He was injured this year and had an injured team. I don't understand how you are writing KD off either. He was literally inches away from moving on. He was hurt and had an injured team as well. He was by far the best player in that series, not Giannis.   Giannis is a top 5 player but LeBron and KD are 1a/1b. Giannis, Kawhi and Steph are all right there. Giannis isn't the guy yet.  This shit changes from year to year. There was a time back in his Pacers days when Paul George was looked at as being on his way to being better than LeBron. Dwight Howard, Cousins and others have all had their brief moments where people were prematurely calling them the next top guy.  I can see Giannis being the top guy. Just not now and not until both KD and LeBron slow down."
Dwight Howard has entered the chat
 CP3 should just jump on Giannis‚Äô back repeatedly like he did to Dwight Howard in 2015   That‚Äôs their only hope
"Jrue ""Dwight Howard"" Holiday"
"Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, and Andre Iguodala."
Head game: Dwight Howard
idk maybe jameer nelson to dwight howard
"The only thing that I see that can keep him from reaching star status is injuries. Other than that I see him becoming one of the top centers in the league. Yes, you can call me a homer. I see the ‚Äúit‚Äù factor with this kid just like with Jordan Poole. He has a unique skillset that if he puts it all together he will be a force of nature.   I‚Äôll call this right now, he‚Äôs going to come out looking like 2nd year Dwight Howard body transformation wise. He‚Äôs covering his body in all his videos but he looks noticeably bigger."
How old are you? Are there actually like 10 year olds on Reddit nowadays that think Philly Dwight is who Dwight Howard is?
"Wilt is probably the most athletic big the game‚Äôs ever seen and even he was only barely able to block Kareem once (or twice ?). In the era of glorified guards I think Giannis with a post hook will do just fine.  On another note only big athletic enough that really could contest a sky hook is probably Giannis himself, maybe prime Dwight Howard too."
Yes. He‚Äôs overrated tbh. I could see him having a career similar to Dwight Howard.
Buyouts as they currently exist are a win-win-win. Teams buying out a player reduce the amount they owe a player by the amount a new team will pick him up at (usually around the MLE). The new team gets the player at a better price than the overpriced deal. And the player doesnt lose any money.   The small market Grizz used the buyout of Dwight Howard as part of a process that got CJ Miles off the books and saved something like $8.1 million.

"Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis also just said, yea, I‚Äôll just show up and play half assed."
"All Defense is way more competitive for bigs than it is for guards. Kobe would not have more all defense 1st teams if the teams were positionless. Duncan was going up against some combination of Kevin Garnett, Ron Artest, Marcus Camby, Dikembe Mutumbo, Andrei Kirilenko, LeBron James, Tyson Chandler, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard every year for nearly a decade."
Ask Dwight Howard
Stephan Marberry Jr smith Andrew Wiggins  Ryan Anderson  Dwight Howard
"Almost all of those players straight up resigned with their team and got super max deals which are one of the few carrots that small market teams can offer superstars. Additionally a good amount of those players then left those teams to go to large markets. IE Steve Nash to the Lakers, Jimmy Butler from Minnesota to Miami , Dwight Howard to Lakers, LMA from Spurs to Brooklyn. Even mentioning Kevin Durant is the antithesis of your point. He joint one of the GOAT teams in the 3rd biggest market in the country.  It‚Äôs a total misnomer saying superstars pick small market teams. More often then not super stars ditch small markets to go to places where they can market themselves better or places with lower income tax."
Wait is this a serious question? You don‚Äôt get why I say James harden vs the 73-9 warriors instead of Steph? Because houston had a trash supporting cast for harden while the warriors were in the midst of blowing up as one of the strongest dynasties we‚Äôve seen recently. Lol dude Trevor ariza? You want me to mention Trevor ariza? At least make it bum ass Dwight Howard. He at least was a big name back then despite being washed and a dinosaur in the league.  You‚Äôre just looking for reasons to whine and act like I‚Äôm being unreasonable your points are so dumb. I‚Äôm not a Steph hater stop crying.
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe? Different era.  &gt; Joe Johnson  [One of the first high profile cases on small market teams having to pay non-deserving max contracts to land meh talent](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/414272-atlanta-hawks-ink-joe-johnson-to-119-million-over-six-year-deal)  Literally goes against the argument you are trying to make.  &gt; Steve Nash (prime)  Sure fine  &gt; Tim Duncan  Drafted on a team and won a ring in his second season.  The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.  Next.  &gt; Yao Ming  lol he agreed to a 4 year max after not playing for a year with foot surgery.  Chinese national I don't think playing for NY is exactly a priority anyways  &gt; Dwight Howard  I mean.. i guess  &gt; Kevin Garnett  I mean he left Minnesota (small market) team for Boston (big market) team so idk..  &gt; Kevin Durant 1.0 free agency (picked Dubs over NYC/LA, who had space and wanted him)  This is the absolute dumbest thing I have ever read.  The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
Dwight Howard took hedo and lewis to the finals .
"I think steve nash,  gordon hayward, dwight howard were overrated"
"The thing that bugs me is his intent is to block, 100% of the time. He'd give up good defensive positions to challenge just to get a better blocking angle, which sometimes leads to an easier layup. For all of his blocks, his on-court defensive metrics is not significantly better than someone comparable with less blocks (case in point: 19-20 Lakers, Dwight Howard with 1.1 less blocks per100poss but only a 2 point drop in DRTG)."
Derrick Rose. I don‚Äôt think he really deserved to win that MVP. LeBron or Dwight Howard should have won it. Rose was great but I do think people tend to over exaggerate how good he was before he was injured just a little
"In a very short timespan, the NBA became similar to the international style of play. Basically, went from a post-game friendly league to favoring 3-pointers.   A dominant-inside player like Dwight Howard went from a top 5 player to almost a liability with his skillset, as he couldn't dominate as a transition player nor 3-point facilitator. Also noticed that his 'FTs per minute played' went down almost 25% as well, coincidentally right around the time Curry started becoming dominant."

"""Sources tell me Dwight Howard to the Knicks.""  ""Chris Paul to the Knicks.""  ""Kevin Durant to the Lakers.""  ""Kyrie is 95% to the Knicks.""  Just a few off the top of my head.  Look - I completely agree that Stephen A has great connections and does break info.  But please don't pretend that *ALL* of these guys would never be above blurting something out to try to be the first to break the story.  Which is what I believe happens - he's likely extremely well connected to the Knicks and his sources there feed him anything they think they have a good shot at - and he spits it out publicly."
I don't understand how Dwight Howard isn't on this team.
People forget cuban didnt make any moves so they could sign Dwight Howard and then just didn't get him
Damn they gotta get Dwight Howard over there. He‚Äôd average 30 rebounds 10 blocks a game
I'm sure Dwight Howard is fuming somewhere lmao.
"Get fucking Dwight Howard, Jarrett Allen and whatever best 7 footer In"
Lolol we ran plays with Dwight Howard as Point Guard
Stephen A Smith saying Dwight Howard wasn't a future HOF last season
Your the only person I‚Äôve seen suggest Dwight Howard. I think he‚Äôd be a great fit. Same for Turner
i mean tyson chandler and dwight howard were the 5s back in the day.  obviously dwight is another level but it's not hard to replace a tyson chandler with one of those guys
I was on a local sports radio show operating the board and the topic was something about Dwight Howard with the Magic and a caller said JJ Redick was a bad shooter and he doubled down after I brought up his percentage from 3 the previous season (41.8% on 4.1 attempts per game)   I know it‚Äôs not the biggest deal but since the guy still insisted I was wrong about the only thing everyone should know about JJ Redick just blew my mind.
Dwight Howard is not why people think the US is full of idiots.
Says a lot about the state of USA basketball in 2021 that they would even consider adding Dwight Howard to the roster.
"I don‚Äôt care who it is. Get Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, or Plumdog Millionaire again. Just go get somebody tall who‚Äôs job is to play defense and get boards."
Only person that come to mind is prime Dwight Howard
"Can‚Äôt really act like there‚Äôs a rule.   Isiah Thomas was a 1st team All-NBA at age 22, same with Dwight Howard.   There are plenty of players that saw success at age 22, the reason why Luka is the most successful 21 year old is more of a part that the previous generations players were rookies at age 22 as opposed to 18-19 like they are today.   You could easily argue that KD was overall better than Luka at the same age Luka is right now, KD finished 2nd in MVP voting to a prime Lebron James at age 21 and lead the league in scoring. He lead his team to the finals at age 22.  Acting like Luka should only be in competition with guys in the top 10 all time just shows that your not really factoring in why those guys ended up top 10 all time:"
I don't want Dwight Howard representing the USA internationally.
"&gt; He‚Äôs 26 his true peak doesn‚Äôt even really happen until about 28-30  Not always the case. I‚Äôd say there are more exceptions, and that most players are in their prime from around 25-29 but there are enough outliers to where it‚Äôs not really useful to view it that way. Giannis could be getting better and better considering he was especially unpolished coming into the league, or maybe he slows down a bit earlier because his athleticism fades. Maybe he pulls a Dwight Howard and decides there‚Äôs some random part of his game that needs to be showcased at all costs and he never gets better then right now. Maybe he‚Äôs like lebron and just keeps adding facets to his game."
"Is the fear of fouling out even effective at preventing that? Take a look back to hack-a-shaq, Dwight Howard, Ben Simmons, Giannis, etc. Teams already do this   Penalize teams harder for total fouls and get rid of individual penalties"
"Yea but I feel like his best years was in nets and phx. He only was with dirk from 09 to like 12? He definitely was not the main guy not even 2nd guy. His best days were behind. Thats like saying Glen Rice was the reason lakers won in 2000 or dwight Howard is the 1 of lakers best guy in 2020 championship.  Even then, I said dirk isn't fully a perimeter.  He can shoot thats it. He doesn't handle the ball up like a guard in half court and on the defensive end he isn't outside"
I mean Dwight Howard already won a ring who was Harden Ex Co-Star teammate.
"This title is slightly misleading. Iggy said from the jump he wanted to go to GSW but they told him they didn't have the cap or flexibility to sign him.  Then Dallas says they want him, they end up putting it on hold for Dwight Howard to make a decision and Iggy gets a call saying GSW has worked out a crazy multi-team sign and trade to make the money work.  Iggy specifically said he wasn't offended by the pause, the GSW offer just wasn't on the table when he was talking to Dallas."
I still will never get over the level of bag fumbling cubes and donnie did in an attempt to get Dwight fucking Howard  Like no disrespect to Dwight but by this point he was not on the same level he was at in like 09 yet cubes and donnie acted like lebron was a FA
Idk why everyone feels the need to compare them to the celtics just because imm a celtics fan I mean they havent been a good team since dwight howard left and before that they havent been good since shaq so go ahead and compare them to whoever you want it doesn‚Äôt matter
Dwight Howard
Don‚Äôt kid yourself my guy the magic is a joke of an organization and if you need to relive the glory days of dwight howard being there to throw jabs at someone that proves my point
Dwight Howard and cp3?
"Butler, CP3, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard, Jrue, and Brandon Ingram included"
"Sure and that's true for everyone, even LeBron (in every last of his slips). Dwight Howard is another semi recent example of a player who was egged on due to his rapid loss of athleticism (still, he managed to have a redemption arc of his own and by now he is a useful role player so people ceased to have issues w him).  My point is more along the lines that one's trajectory may also show how his ""fall"" may be. Many expect Giannis' to be abrupt, however his road to stardom was not (at all) abrupt , he worked from earliest of ages and continuously added things to his game, given that (in fact) I expect him to counter his athleticism's fall with relying more on his game which will start fleshing out.   So I truly expect his fall to be closer to Lebron's, i.e. gradual and many people would only notice when looking (way) back instead of anything abrupt like it seemingly was w Dwight and Russ (though Dwight's was ""aided"" by his back issues ... but still)."
"yeah, no way they win 33 fucking games.  impossible given that he's...check stats  34-34 career without Embiid.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/ben-simmons-win-loss-record-without-embiid  you all want to clown my man, but he's going .500 with fucking Dwight Howard and the ghost of Mike Scott playing the 5"
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre‚Ä¶. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also‚Ä¶. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc‚Ä¶."
"They still had Bynum who they ended up trading for Dwight Howard. Maybe that trade would have happened sooner before Howard got injured. CP3, Kobe, and a healthy Howard would have been formidable."
"PG- Malcolm Brogdan SG- Collin Sexton SF-Jaylen Brown PF-Jae Crowder C-Dwight Howard Bench:  Antony Edward, Derrick Favors, Malik Beasley, Wendell Carter  Overall team ga wouldn't be bad, especially if Dwight was back in prime form."
"If we‚Äôre doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We‚Äôre lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can‚Äôt think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I‚Äôm leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
"Honestly the comparisons are pretty good. Brady got a lot of vets teams weren‚Äôt going after (Gronk, AB etc. ) put them on the Bucs and won. Bron got ( Rondo, Dwight Howard, Boogie, fucking JR Smith and Dion etc. ) and took them to a title"
Is Simmons the new Dwight Howard? Amazing specimen and elite in a couple skills but also deeply flawed.
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don‚Äôt pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot.

"Dwight Howard looked great on the Lakers. Simmons is a much more versatile defender, and he has more offensive game than an aging Dwight Howard too"
"Lemme tell ya what CJ deficiencies are. When dame gets beat off the dribble, CJ will leave his corner assignment to help cuz he thinks he‚Äôs prime Dwight Howard in the paint apparently.   This almost 100% of the time leads to an open corner three or a shooting foul. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve yelled at my tv screen ‚ÄúStop fucking helping CJ! You aren‚Äôt!!!‚Äù"
"They could have done that for a fraction of the price though. Guys like Robin Lopez, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Howard would have been fine."
"I think that's oversimplifying it. The 2000 team had close calls, the 2002 team was a mess, the 2004 team won Bronze because the everyone but AI/Duncan pulled out from the 2003 team. As mentioned above, the 2006 Team USA led by LeBron, Wade, CP3, Melo, Dwight Howard, Bosh, etc lost to a Greece team. They could've lost even more games if Melo didn't spark scoring runs during close games. 2008 could've ended in a Silver medal if not for Kobe. They had it all figured out after that in 2010, 2012 and 2014. They started looking vulnerable again after that. In 2016, they had some close calls as well, one of them again requiring Melo to turn the clock back against Australia.   &amp;nbsp;  1992,1996, 2003 and 2012 were the only times I thought they looked untouchable."
"&gt; Udonis Haslem would still be in the league in 2022  Even though he has already been out a season, Vince playing up until 2020 would have been pretty unbelievable. I remember Dwight Howard called him half man half retired when he was on the Magic lol"
"It‚Äôs super unfair to compare Dwight Howard and Melos efficiency. Dwight has close to no post up game, all his shot were hand fed. Melo on the other hand had to create most of his shots. Mitchell Robinson shot 75% last year, but he‚Äôs not a better scorer than steph"
Dwight Howard had 31 a few years ago.
"&gt; some people said Rose shouldn‚Äôt have won that year regardless.  Rose being MVP that year certainly had a lot of media hype behind it, but he was legit one of the most valuable players in 2011.  On pure stats you can make the case for LeBron being MPV, but he was playing beside D Wade which made that a hard vote. Dwight Howard was the only other guy who had a strong case for being that one man that the team is built on that the MVP typically goes to."
"Look, people *want to believe* you can make a man drop by first pretending to move one direction and then actually moving another.   It is part of the human condition.

Dwight Howard had a crazy game for the hornets too
"So back when this happened, it was pretty consensus that Reggie had the best team.  But looking back now, Kerr's team is pretty filthy. The starting lineup would be Nash/Kobe/LeBron/Malone/Russell, which is easily the best, despite him ""wasting"" a pick on Scottie Pippen. Then along with Scottie, you've got 2011 Dirk, prime injury-free Grant Hill, and 3-straight DPOY Dwight Howard. Dennis Johnson is a bad pick with Pistol Pete on the board, but what a squad."
Can you imagine eating an elbow from Dwight Howard battling for a board? I mean you might die. Like literally die.
Yeah it was rough. Swept by the Magic with Dwight Howard I think
"It‚Äôs been decades and for some reason people still don‚Äôt understand that the NBA lists height with basketball shoes on *and* they round up. When you get measured at the doctors office you‚Äôre barefoot. That difference can easily be 2 inches.   Everyone I know that‚Äôs met Kobe says that he was 6‚Äô4, and I‚Äôve heard similar things about Jordan. Dwight Howard and KD are both known to be sub 6‚Äô10 barefoot, but people refer to them as 6‚Äô11."
"All time blocks, 3830 Hakeem Olajuwon. Closets player still playing has 2192, Dwight Howard. This is an unbreakable record."
"Harden was carrying an injured Dwight Howard, a bunch of role players and bums like Joey Dorsey to the 2 seed &amp; WCF in the West.  Another year he had an injured CP3, Capela and Gordon and was averaging 40, 50 points a game at certain stretches."
"Surprise he only had 3 kids, you would think he would have been in Dwight Howard situation"
Idk if it's a pasta but I love the Dwight Howard come to Milwaulkee post. Shit cracks me up.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1hpxcr/dwight_you_can_still_change_your_mind  Ish Smith: IS A POINT GUARD   Greek Rookie Guy: FREAK
I'm pretty sure he was involved in the trade that sent Dwight Howard to the lakers.
Dwight Howard definitely deserves an honorable mention.  Had a reputation of being disliked by his teammates on *every* team he's been on up until the 2020 Lakers.   Wasn't until a couple years ago that he finally mellowed out.
just the objective truth my friend. Luka is 99.99th percentile complainer. he was even second in the league in T‚Äôs only behind one of the goat babies Dwight Howard.
"Lesser known pasta  MAGIC FANS IN PHOENIX  I'M SO SICK OF MAGIC FANS INFILTRATING OUR ARENA  Seriously, every year their entire fan base has the audacity to come and try to infiltrate our home court. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have been to a Suns Magic game and gotten in arguments with stupid Magic fans. Bro, stop trying to tell me Dennis Scott  was the best shooter you have ever seen. Stop shoving Hedo Turkoglu and Rashads Lewis piss samples from 15 years ago in my face trying to prove to me they weren‚Äôt on PEDs. I don‚Äôt care that your sister banged Dwight Howard and he doesn‚Äôt pay for child support.  But this stops NOW . Stop giving Magic fans our tickets. Seriously background check if you need to. Oh the person buying your tickets has an aunt who interned in Orlando back in 89?NOPE no tickets for you bitch.  This isnt Disney World. This isnt Lake Eola park. This isnt a shitty frat party UCF.

Dwight Howard didn‚Äôt deserve the disrespect he got in LA dude put up 20-12 with a broken back and got fucked because Kobe wanted him to play injured
"Look, people *want to believe* you can make a man drop by first pretending to move one direction and then actually moving another.   It is part of the human condition. It is part of why NBA and any other sports league exists - to play fast and loose with the superstitious, idol-worshipping, and ego-maniac side of the public hivemind. It is about harvesting and reining in the smart apes' primitive aggression so they stare at a screen instead of burning things down.  When children stare open-mouthed at the TV where cartoon characters shoot colored beams from their hands, there is a little voice in their heads saying: *""If you are good enough, you can do transcendent, otherworldly feats"".* You can become *more than human*.   What happens when the channel is changed to ESPN?   ""This athlete can dunk after jumping from the free throw line and over a car."" (reality: he jumps over the hood, had a running start spanning the entire court which the commercial conveniently cut out, and had 7 failed attempts before).   ""This athlete can break his opponent's ankles with his crossover."" (reality: his opponent loses his balance more due to exhaustion, accidentally tripping over himself and floor condition than due to being manipulated).  It is like wanting to believe Superman and five point palm exploding heart technique exists. We already got Dwight Howard wearing a cape. Next up should be Trae Young exploding people's hearts after dunking on them 3 times."
Dwight Howard is a straight man
"Are you trolling?  Harden was a Sixth Man in OKC, I aint talking about those days. Im talking prime for prime.  Curry always had Draymond, Klay, Iggy and a great bench and then traded that bench for KD.  Dwight Howard isnt on the level of all that fire power and neither is Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook.  If you really think Curry hasnt had the better supporting casts for his prime, you gotta take the homer glasses off. The fact the Warriors made the WCF without him playing in the first 2 rounds in 2016 says it all."
"Going 2000 to 2006 gets you Lebron, Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, Joe Johnson, Jason Terry, Mike Dunleavy, and Andrew Bynum. I didn't do every combination but that's a helluva start.  Just looking at good consecutive #1 picks, Building around 92 and 93 gets you...  89 - Stacey King 90 - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Rumeal Robinson 91 - Billy Owens 92 - Shaquille O'Neal 93 - Chris Webber 94 - Eddie Jones  There's some combinations that gets you Michael Jordan at #3 and either Brad Daugherty and Patrick Ewing or Brad Daugherty and David Robinson. Whoever is the best combination of the other #3 pick and the best guy you get with the #10's and #6 has to be decent."

"I remember listening to local talk radio about the warriors trying to get Dwight Howard to sign, and their pitch was you'll be there biggest star in an untapped market (this was pre Kaepernick days), and there's so much money to be made here by a true star.  He passed for Houston, and fast forward: Steph curry had a shoe brand.  Steph made.so much money being the biggest star in a giant market looking for a star. Hell, Iggy came back to build his investing brand."

"Players who are lean and athletic with long wingspans, anywhere from 6'2-6'6 are usually the most fun to watch play. When a player is 6'8 and up, they start getting almost too big and clunky, even for the freak athletes like Giannis, Lebron and prime Dwight Howard. Only Hakeem looked that fluid and graceful at 6'11. Kareem was also very fluid for a 7'2 player, but he wasn't very flashy, just very fundamentally sound like Tim Duncan."

id love to test this hypothesis and trade dwight howard for him
I haven't watched a Magic game since Dwight Howard.
"#Jeremy Lin  Steph Curry, Kyle Lowry, Monte Ellis, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Amar'e Stoudemire, David Lee, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol are the biggest names I could think of. I think I got them all.   I'll go with Curry, Kobe, Kawhi, Melo, Gasol"
I'ma go with my guy Dwight.   PG: Harden/Kemba  SG: Kobe/Beal (very brief time together like &lt;10 games)  SF: LeBron/Vince Carter  PF: Anthony Davis/Rashard  C: Dwight Howard/Millsap (doesn't need to necessarily play 5 but this team needed another somewhat interior defensive big)
I still get hyped watching [this clip](https://youtu.be/HxVRQHU5It0) where Iverson goes to shoot it after a whistle and I think rookie or sophomore Dwight Howard grabs it before it goes in and then AI gets the ball back and shoots that shit with a crazy ass unblockable arc just wild
"Looks like I can't say Dwight Howard, Iguodala, or Korver because they never suited up. We have had guys like the Gasol brothers each leave an imprint on the team, and we have also had some fun vets like Vince Carter and Allen Iverson stop by for a bit. I think I will go with Iverson as the best player."
Dwight Howard didn‚Äôt make your list?  1. Rudy  2. AD 3. Giannis
"Do you mean top 10 most impactful defenders ever? You could make the argument that centers have a bigger impact on defense due to their position and should be ranked higher in terms of impact, I guess. Would multiple-time DPOY centers be ranked higher than MJ in terms of top defenders of all time, then? Guys like Dwight Howard, Gobert, Ben Wallace, Mutumbo, etc?"
"When people say legitimate guard 5s it doesn't mean guard them all game it means he was capable of switching to a 5 and still defend the big man.   Lebron also was going up against some tough competition: Kevin Garnett, Ben Wallace, Dwight Howard, and even Noah/Gasol.   You could even argue the year Jordan won his DPOY that Hakeem deserved it. Michael just had an amazing offensive season as well so the media bias for Jordan to win it all was too strong."
"I love how people use one instance to define Lebron, maybe David West was an outliner lol? David West was just a really hard match up for Lebron. David was just as tall if not slightly taller and stronger. He could bully Bron at his own game. Bron is strong likely one of the stronger dudes in the NBA but what makes him great isn't the fact that he's the STRONGEST dude. It's the fact that he is in the top 90% in every aspect. He's not the fastest but he's one of the fastest, He's not the strongest but he's one of the strongest, he's not the tallest... okay maybe he's not one of the tallest but he's tall enough, He's not the highest jumper but he's one of them.   Just like if you watch Lebron smoke West on the other side with his speed and quickness. Lebron's defense was always physical he could guard 1-5 but he'd struggle against 4/5's that could match him strength wise because in this time frame all bigs played in the low block basically and it was almost purely about strength or finesse. Players that relied more on the former would always get the best of Bron. West, Dwight Howard, Stoudemire, etc.   But he always handled finesse players well, like Melo, Guards, Pau, etc. Also, idk if you actually play ball but making a lob too Pau in the spot Fisher is in, is basically an impossible task. Fisher isn't a great passer and Pau isn't a great leaper it's too risky and can easily lead to a fast break(guess what the heat were known for?) Can't look at the game of basketball inside a box gotta expand a bit and think outside on how the game works and how players are."
"Uhhh‚Ä¶ weird that your comment is so low IQ.   While you‚Äôre right about him not being a standout rotation player, he was still a solid rotation player, had pretty nice BBIQ, did not make low IQ plays, is like the godfather of the flop/charge.  And Javale is lightyears ahead of Varejao in every way except BBIQ, so even that comparison is wrong.   In any case, if DWade had it in his heart to yam it down, contested, in the lane‚Ä¶ he would‚Äôve done that to any center in the league save maybe Dwight Howard."
"Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Carmelo, and Dwight Howard"
Trae Young - nutmeg  Dwight Howard - shoulders
dwight howard would be seen as a laker lifer
Dwight Howard and CP3 were good for 1 year each with the Rockets and Westbrook was coming back from COVID.
i world not say nice jump shot.  but yes a remarkable player and person overall.  he'd do fine today.  think Dwight Howard but bigger and better at everything.
Luka hasn‚Äôt played with Westbrook Chris Paul or Dwight Howard. Just a shell of porzingiz.
Dwight Howard was a good pickup by the Lakers in 2019.  Boris Diaw back in 2012 is another one I remember.
Dwight Howard might start over Gasol
Prime Dwight Howard as sixth man‚Ä¶ yikes
"How many times have you heard *MULTIPLE players* not front office, fly cross-country to recruit a free agent?    I've heard star players might make pitches at home. For instance, Kobe pitched Dwight Howard back in 2011 or so to join the Lakers.  And Derrick Rose, when he was MVP, had no interest in recruiting Bron"
"I would argue yes.  If you look at the top players in the game today, it‚Äôs clear that this is the era with the biggest variety in terms of style of play.    Today you have sharpshooting guards with elite playmaking in Curry, Dame, Harden, CP3, Trae Young etc.    But you also have big, physical wings who like to slash in Giannis and Lebron.  You have 3-level scorers who are elite from midrange in KD, Luka, and Kawhi.   You‚Äôve got Jokic who is an elite low post scorer who can extend to the 3 and is an elite playmaker.    You‚Äôve got Embiid who can shoot threes, but makes his money being absolutely game changing beneath the rim.    You‚Äôve got Rudy Gobert who has never made a 3 in his career, but changes the game defensively.    And that‚Äôs not even touching on the next generation of players coming up all of whom are bringing new skill sets into the game.    This variety exists because the 3 pointer is so important today.  Why?  Because it‚Äôs so easy to get 3pt shooters in today‚Äôs game.  In the 2000‚Äôs, the game was entirely predicated on iso scoring wings and dominant low post players.  But that meant if you wanted to be a star, you had to be either an iso scoring wing (Kobe, TMac, DWade, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, hell even Lebron played as an iso scoring guard when he first came into the league) or a dominant low post player (Shaq, Yao Ming, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard).  If you had any other skill set, you were a role player.  Are you an elite wing defender and playmaker?  Role player.  Are you a hyper efficient 3pt shooter?  Role player.  Are you a stretch big who can rebound, pass, handle the ball, and guard on the perimeter?  Well can you go against Shaq one-on-one 2ft from the basket?  No?  Role player.    Nowadays, if you come into the NBA with staf potential, regardless of skill set teams can build around you because the only requirement that a team needs to have offensive is good shooting, and you can get that from role players, you don‚Äôt need that from your stars.  So now stars can be whatever they are best at, and teams will fill in the rest of the team with 3&amp;D role players and be all set."
People still act like Dwight Howard is actually gay
"No. I'm acting like a 20 year old not knowing certain facts or not caring about traditional education isn't the end of the world considering he was playing professional basketball as a Teenager. Literally.   Lamelo is among the small group of people who did not need school. Basketball stars project to the NBA early. EARLY. You almost always see it coming unless it's an AD or Dwight Howard.   So no. Lamelo Ball. Who at 17 was playing basketball against grown men professionally did not need school. Again, you're wrong."
"It‚Äôs crazy that the NBA has gotten to a point where almost all elite players are adding 35ft+ bombs to threaten defenses.  Take this with a grain of salt though, no NBA player misses in empty gyms. Dwight Howard could shoot from every spot on the 3pt line and hit the vast majority of them in the empty gym.  The NBA doesn‚Äôt only require elite skill, but a large amount of these NBA players are athletically on the level of low tier Olympic sprinters, long jumpers, and more. And these guys are also sporting huge 6‚Äô3+ frames.  It‚Äôs underrated how much duress an offensive player is under in these NBA games. These guys have to rush their shots, the vast majority of the made layups and jumpers that get made were fractions of a second away from getting blocked. The defense is that tough."
"Rim-runners are replaceable, but there's still only a finite amount of rim-runners who are available at any given time and sometimes you gotta pay a little bit extra for the betterment of your team.  JaVale, Robin Lopez and Gorgui Dieng got all in the 4-5M per year range. The guys who got vet mins with the exception of Dwight Howard (ring-chasing) are all players that have a ton more flaws than any of the above guys."
"I can understand the lack of wanting a long-term investment but I will argue that with your team especially that JaVale was their best option and they paid slightly more than the vet min to fill a big hole in the roster.  JaVale, Robin Lopez and Gorgui Dieng got all in the 4-5M per year range. The guys who got vet mins with the exception of Dwight Howard (ring-chasing) are all players that have a ton more flaws than any of the above guys.  Rim-runners are replaceable, but there's still only a finite amount of rim-runners who are available at any given time and sometimes you gotta pay a little bit extra for the betterment of your team."
"Probably because: 1) Analysts liked the Clippers back then with Lou Will, Kawhi, PG13, Pat Bev, Montrezl, etc. compared to the Lakers. While the Lakers were the betting favorites, the Clippers were sort of the favorites among analysts and media. 2) There were questions on the Lakers regarding age, fit, lack of shooting, etc. They were among the oldest teams in the league (now they're even older) and their best shooters were KCP, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, and Troy Daniels (before he was waived in the middle of the season). Not to mention potential fit issues with Dwight Howard in the mix. Plus, ""AD at the 5"" debates started when they insisted on starting McGee at the 5 at the start of the season. 3) How much did Lebron have left after a rough 2018-19 season when he had a non-contact injury when he pulled his groin and he performed rather mediocre for his standards after he came back. 4) Frank Vogel: How well can he coach guys like Lebron, AD, Dwight, etc.? Sure, he's well known for his defensive schemes. But was that enough to get them over the top.  Fortunately for them, things worked out in the end. Sure, the Bubble sort of added context on how the championship will be remembered, but every playoff team had to deal with it."
"Dwight Howard posted videos of him draining 3s in the gym and he has decent form. It‚Äôs just  fucking hard to do in an actual game, but would be cool to see him attempt one or two every few games if we‚Äôre ahead. Would be crazy to see an aging big known for living in the paint add that to his bag."
"Right, the Lakers basically paid Dwight Howard in 2020 to sit on the bench until it was time to throw an extra big at Jokic. He sat on the bench with DNPs the rest of the playoffs, but was logging a solid 15-20 minutes a game against the Nuggets. And it worked pretty damn well to wear Jokic out and keep him frustrated."
"He literally got the next best wing player in the league after himself and Kobe to team up with him lol, not to mention the most athletic and agile big in the league not named Dwight Howard. I don't see how that's THAT MUCH different from joining a superteam."
"To reduce the offensive skills of Harden and Kobe to ""efficiency and playmaking"" versus ""floor raising and off-ball movement"" is vastly oversimplifying their offensive games.  Harden in his prime operated best from:  * The top of the key, operating off the pick and roll where he could:  * hit the roll man (for example, Capela for lobs)  * make the skip pass  * punish the pick and roll big man defender by attacking the paint   * drawing fouls   * hitting floaters  * the midrange (sometimes via the high post), which went away during the D'Antoni years * **his most lethal and signature attack** nowadays is his above the 3 point line isolation game, where he can hit the defender with a flurry of dribble moves to set up a step-back or drive-and-kick.  Kobe's offensive arsenal had more variety, which is partly a product of his time and coaching (Jackson's system). Early 2000s ball emphasized isolation ball, and players like Kobe, T-mac, VC, Iverson, and others who grew up emulating Jordan had some of the most polished and varied isolation games since Jordan. These are the kind of guys who would destroy modern players in 1vs1 simply because of their arsenal. Think an entire generation of guys who had offensive bags like Kyrie Irving.  Kobe could attack from:  * high post, as an initiator of the triangle. He often strayed from the triangle in this position to Jackson's chagrin and let his creativity go to work. * mid post, in isolation with his fadeaway, or as a playmaker in the triangle * low post, especially against smaller guards. Kobe had lethal footwork, surprising strength, and more post finishing moves than the average big man. * pic and roll, especially later in his prime with Pau Gasol. See the 2008 spurs, 2009 magic series where Kobe torched teams with his mid-range, drop-off passes, and amazing finishing against all-time great big men like prime [Tim Duncan](https://youtu.be/5aXVxcLm2qQ?t=324) and [Dwight Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xilW4WiS1Qo). * off ball * 3 point line isolation  There's honestly not enough space to really dive into his entire arsenal. Each of these bullet points could be a whole Kobe masterclass. As I mentioned above, both of these guys are a product of their times. If Harden were in Kobe's era, he would've flourished under the triangle, and if Kobe were in Harden's era, he would've worked on his 3-point shot more. To me, it comes down to their natural gifts, which are really subtle and hard to say definitively.  In my opinion, Harden is the naturally better:  * pure shooter - especially with Kobe's two-shot motion being less reliable. * unselfish team player - Kobe would shoot his team out of a game before passing (and not always because of the triangle) * dribbler - Harden's tight dribble package is phenomenal and his footwork in these positions is really tight  But what Kobe had over Harden was:  * strength - Kobe was just a bit bigger and stronger without sacrificing much if any speed to Harden * leaping ability - Kobe's body type was lankier, which translated into better leaping (especially early in his career) whereas Harden was never the highflyer Kobe was. Kobe's paint attacking was truly amazing and on another level than Harden's. Harden makes up for some of it with his foul-drawing prowess, but against smart, vertical big men Harden struggles compared to Kobe. * cutting and activity - Kobe's motor especially earlier in his prime was amazing to watch. He would physically wear out defenders by coming off of rub screens, posting them up, coming off of screens, and fighting for offensive rebounds. In his prime he was one of the best-conditioned players in the league. * transition - again, Kobe's leaping ability, physicality, and motor made him one of the best transition scorers especially early-prime.  To me, Kobe's era-independent strengths give him the slight edge over Harden. Prime Kobe's modern-day best comparison would be a combination of Kawhi's lethal midrange and post game, combined with Paul George's excellent pick and roll finesse, Booker's off ball game, while also being a top 5 highflyer."
Can somebody fill me in on the Dwight Howard gym story.   Be sure to tag u/-bluemonster when you do it. I'm not sure if he has heard it before
"Bam coulda played the other 3 games and Dragic coulda played the other 4.5 and it woulda ended just the same, in 6 games. Heat were no match.   The Lakers woulda abused a defender like Dragic on switches about the same as others, and Dragic playing woulda unintentionally limited Jimmy's insane amount of touches which were what gave the Heat's offense life in those Finals.  Bam coming back also hurt spacing, even if he's much better overall than Olynyk, and woulda made it harder for Jimmy to run the offense the way he did (spread out, P&amp;R on the mismatch and attack wide open paint) as Bam's offense was useless vs AD &amp; Dwight Howard.  Dragic &amp; Bam played in G6, when people thought the series tide was about to shift, and they went down by 30+ at the start."
"Lol. Casual. So Harden‚Äôs greatest achievement is getting 3 wins in a series and then losing. Just getting to WCF is not even celebrated. He had Dwight Howard, CP3, Westbrook, and Durant throughout his career. All he did was consistently lose. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs hiding behind that beard. He‚Äôs ashamed and taking it out on all his stripper friends. He can go ahead and admire Kobe‚Äôs rings. Harden is a loser with a regular season game of foul baiting."
"Great journalist when it comes to Boston. She has that Bob Ryan, ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt take Dwight Howard‚Äô thing the world hates. It‚Äôs ok she‚Äôs from Boston. We all hate Boston, not her."
If I have to hear that Dwight Howard gym story again ffs‚Ä¶
"Before a Houston-GSW playoff game, a friend and I showed up early to catch the players warming up. I watched Dwight Howard, playing a shooting game with his trainer, hit 17/20 corner threes --- with his left hand"
Best I have is Dwight Howard. That work?
"Now that I think about it, I‚Äôm pretty sure we got Howard by trading away Miles Plumlee and Marco Belinelli. The whole thing was a disaster.   1.	We traded a relatively valuable FRP for Belinelli in a desperation move to scrape into the 8 seed, so that we could be swept.  2.	In another ‚Äúwin now‚Äù move we panicked and traded the cheap contracts of Spencer Hawes and Roy Hibbert for the terrible contract of Miles Plumlee 3.	Stuck with Plumlee‚Äôs terrible contract, we took the only deal we could find to unload him, which was to take Dwight Howard who fit terribly with our team. We also got the #31 pick in the deal, but we traded it for cash considerations and a low second rounder  The entire end of the Cho regime was just a non-stop fight to reach the 8 seed, where we kept making worse and worse decisions to try to salvage the other terrible decisions we made in the past.   The whole situations made me feel really anxious about trading for another Plumlee this offseason, lol. Luckily, Mason is better than his brother and on a much cheaper deal. All the other moves we made were with an eye towards the future too."
the dwight howard era in houston is complicated to say the least. he was definitely hated (a lot!) but it‚Äôs died down now that he‚Äôs viewed as a loveable role player.
Again after 2011 finals many wouldn't say that. People called lebron a weak minded playoff choker all off season long. I still remember on facebook arguing against lebron haters who said dwight howard&gt;lebron lol(to be fair he did have a great season that year).  That's your opinion.  Of course giannis isn't there yet because he hasn't peaked. Comparing players at their peaks to a player still improving every year and not at his peak yet makes no sense. So again i don't understand your point.
"Dwight Howard was 2nd in MVP voting that year. Even if Derrick Rose didn't win (he fully deserved to win that year), Dwight would've been the runner up. It's absurd to think that people wanted LeBron to have that one."
"Yep. By contrast on first picks overall win shares:  48, 20.8, 65.9, 242, 138.2, 50.6, 18.9, 7.3, 42.8, 77.2, 44.1  So, if the first pick gets you a 50% chance of getting: Lebron, Blake Griffin, John wall, Derrick rose, Dwight Howard, or Yao Ming   That‚Äôs a better than 50% chance at an all NBA player. The two biggest busts are Bargaini and Oden."
"Wait, when did Dwight Howard play for the Hornets? I don‚Äôt remember that at all."
I completely forget Dwight Howard was on the Hornets.
"Harden will never be their best player when KD is on the floor. This postseason has assured that. Harden always had a  co-star. First it was Dwight Howard, then CP3 then Westbrook and now a big-3"
"Is anyone else imagining a portly SVG, clad in white armor sending 2009 Dwight Howard into battle with an Orlando Magic Loyalty T-shirt against a battalion of Enes Kanters, all dressed like Lawrence of Arabia? Begun, the culture wars have."
"Harden is not a better basketball player than Curry. That‚Äôs just crazy. This over dribbler still lost with non-garbage teammates like CP3, Eric Gordon, Ariza, and Capela. Then he also played with Westbrook or a prime Dwight Howard in Houston. Before that, Westbrook and KD when he was young. In OKC, he disappeared. Then with Houston, he always fell short since his game is built for the regular season with that foul baiting iso style.   He was also dumb enough to not be in shape at the start of last season which caused him to get injured at the end."
Well Durant beat Lebron multiple times. Kawhi beat Lebron. Hell Prime Dwight Howard beat Lebron in a series. Does that mean Lebron is 4th all time? No. Head to head means nothing on who‚Äôs the better player unless they actually go 1v1 and even then you have to take into account the teams around them.
The Anti Dwight Howard
"2007 Suns, 2001 Kings, 2002 Nets, 2011 Bulls, the Grit and Grind Grizzlies, the Dwight Howard Magic, the 90's Jazz, the GP Sonics, the PG13/Hibbert Pacers, the Reggie Miller Pacers, the Ewing Knicks, any Iverson team, and honorable mention to the Blazers for Brandon Roy/Greg Oden/Aldridge (all individually incredibly game changing players... when healthy)"
It's kinda hard to take these kinda tweets serious anymore after what happened with dwight howard.
"Then add the fact that Lebron was 36.5% from 3 and 69.8% from the FT line, Davis was 26 and 73.8%, and Westbrook was 31.5 and 65.6%. The spacing and shooting concerns are legit even more so if you have a C like Dwight Howard in there."
Dwight Howard Brooklyn Nets Legend for all literal 30 seconds
"If Kobe's not #1 he's gotta be #2. He has EVERYTHING. Kobe's game evolved throughout his career and we got to see the full package. Flashy dunks, athletic dunks, tenacious defense, monster blocks, crazy fadeaways, dozens of gamewinners, impeccable footwork, creative shot creation, tight crossovers, post game, lefty shots, etc. Kobe passed the ball to himself off the glass at least 5-6 times. He's dunked on Yao, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard. Behind the back 360 dunk. Shot over countless double teams."
"A name people often bring up is Dwight Howard. Despite all his accolade his game remained limited, and he failed to reach the potential many people expected. Others argue his achievements throughout his career prove he in fact reached that potential.  Others I had in mind: Jeff Green, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Jennings, Michael Beasley, Rondo, Derrick Williams, and I always though Eric Bledsoe would be better"
Did you know Dwight Howard and Josh Smith played on the same AAU team?
Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant haven‚Äôt played against each other since late December 2017
More like Orlando Dwight Howard.
"Ok I didn‚Äôt ask if the signings were successful so I don‚Äôt see the point in that comment.   But let‚Äôs break it down. LeBron and Shaq are our 2 biggest feee agent signings. Malone and Payton were big so that gives us 4 even tho 2 of those signings were past their prime. Ron Artest should not count as a superstar/great player signing. He wasn‚Äôt close to being an all star so you‚Äôre reaching. Dwight Howard was traded to us and he left. We got him back after he was bought out. He wasn‚Äôt a great signing, it was a smart signing because few teams wanted him. Steve Nash was past his prime and was 38 when we got him. Kind of reaching by including a 48 year old wouldn‚Äôt you? Melo is no longer an elite player. There‚Äôs no way you can count him as one of our great signings. He‚Äôs the definition of a role player and has been for the last couple of years. Mid tier role players aren‚Äôt great players. I asked you to  make me a list of all our great player free agent signings. Danny Green was a great signing but he wasn‚Äôt a great Laker, Trevor Ariza is washed, Fisher scammed the Jazz and signed with us but he isn‚Äôt a great player. He is a Laker legend tho for his contributions. Rondo was viewed as a bad signing. People said he wouldn‚Äôt fit with the Lakers because he‚Äôs ball dominant and can‚Äôt shoot. Funny how the narrative changed.   Perfect let‚Äôs talk about those players, PG didn‚Äôt give us a meeting after bitching that he wanted to go to the Lakers, Kawhi didn‚Äôt sign with us after rumors came out that his preferred destination was the Lakers before he got traded to the Raptors, DeRozan didn‚Äôt sign with us, AD was traded to us, iguadala didn‚Äôt sign with us.   No team is getting free agents on discounts in the last decade? I guess the Heatles didn‚Äôt exist, i guess the warriors didn‚Äôt get a ton of great feee agents, i guess the Nets didn‚Äôt just get every free agent last year? Lmao come on man.  So out of all those players you were only able to give me 2 Laker great signings (Shaq + LeBron), 2 great players in Payton and Malone and then a bunch of role players. Nash wasn‚Äôt great even when we signed him, he came off a season averaging 12/10. And the. You named a bunch of role players.   So go ahead and name all the GREAT PLAYERS  that we signed because so far you were only able to name 4 and I‚Äôm giving you 2 of those"
"I wont qualify whether they were sucessfull or not, cuz that was not your inital statement. but look at the names the lakers pull in free agency.   Lebron, shaq, malone, payton, ron artest, steve nash(snt), dwight howard. melo. mid tier role players as well, danny green, trevor ariza, fisher, rondo, schoeder(was sought after prior to last year). Numerous other recentish players who wanted to or rumored to go to want to sign  or force their way to the lakers, Kawhi, Paul george, DeRozan, AD(obv), Igoudala etc etc.   not gonna accept the ""but nash was garbage and payton and malone were old"" arguements cuz they arnt relevant here. No other team is consistently over the last few decades getting free agent veteran players that want to play for their team at a discount.   gtfo"
Dwight Howard would be a WWE legend. He has the personality and physique. I could imagine a storyline where he goes from hero to villain and back again.
Not with Dwight Howard along.
Dwight howard was praised as the best back up center embiid ever had.  But he looked no better than greg monroe when we needed him most

Just look at Dwight Howard. Definitely on T.
"&gt;So a bunch of prime of their career hall of famers in the west and a bunch of up and comers and perrenial losers in the east?  lol @ losers and up comers as **accurate** for classifying Derozan, Butler, Giannis, Melo, PG, and Lowry. And no, I did not compare them to Durant, Curry, Harden, AD , Kawhi, Westbrook, Prime Boogie, left out players like Dame, CP3, Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dwight Howard, Dirk, because there is no need to do so.   I compared them only to, themselves, and the celebrated status they enjoy.   Therefore I stick my argument, that those players are comparably effective as the West stars. Plus I chose to use that year's ASG roster, because it gave the best **real time** window into who all was playing at an elite level that season when the East was so ""weak"" as some people imagined."
"In all honesty Dwight Howard and his dumb fouls (including the flagrant) were a major reason we lost the series as well. Playing Thybulle, Howard, Simmons lineups was also coaching malpractice by Doc. Some of his lineups were horrendous and sixers were bleeding points rapidly."
"So a bunch of prime of their career hall of famers in the west and a bunch of up and comers and perrenial losers in the east? Just read your own list, your comparing Derozan, Butler, young Giannis, Wall, Melo, recovering PG , Lowry, Kemba, and Milsap ..... to Durant, Curry, Harden, AD , Kawhi, Westbrook, Prime Boogie, left out players like Dame, CP3, Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dwight Howard, Dirk.   In fact here is a top 100 list from 2016 , 13 of the top 16 are western conference players. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2015/08/25/top-100-nba-players-2016"
"Not just Bazemore, but fucking DWIGHT HOWARD as well. Talk about a God tier negotiation table lol."
For a small forward.  And yes he was. He wasn't in the company of someone like Dwight Howard for instance but he was the equivalent of an above average starting centre in terms of rim protection in Miami. It's what let Miami do pseudo small ball lineups.  Evidently you have no clue about basketball if you don't acknowledge James' defensive excellence.
2015 Dwight Howard absolutely counts as a star bruh.
"Tried to post this Just my two cents in the discussion...      Going through the initial list from NBA 50th anniversary and Simmon's Pantheon (given that he is/was the basketball savant)... seems that there are 27 players in the Pantheon (not on the 50) AND have ended their career later than 96:         Rank Player	               Rank Player	Rank	Player	Rank	Player   7	  Tim Duncan	39	 Dirk	69	Dennis Rodman	85	Arvydas Sabonis   8	  Kobe Bryant	41	 Gary Payton	72	Chris Webber	88	Shawn Kemp   20	  Lebron James	43	 Jason Kidd	74	Joe Dumars	89	Vince Carter   22	  Kevin Garnett	47	 Paul Pierce	77	Tracy McGrady	90	Chris Paul   28	  Dwyane Wade	55	 Dominique Wilkins	78	Dwight Howard	93	Kevin Johnson   36	  Steve Nash	62	Ray Allen	82	Chris Mullin	96	Tom Chambers   37	  Allen Iverson	63	Reggie Miller	84	Robert Horry		   IMO, all the names up to Rodman should be included in the 75, as well as Tracy, Dwight and Chris Paul - total 18 players      Of course the Pantheon doesn't include current household names as KD, Steph, Harden, Leonard or Giannis (could also add Westbrook in that list for MVP and number of All-NBA teams consideration). - other 6 players, bringing the total to 24.      That leaves one extra player to add in the top 75. Perhaps Jokic due to his late MVP, dunno.      The tough question to answer is whether we are keeping the initial NBA 50 list intact or can we remove a few names and create space for more current players?  |||| |:-|:-|:-| ||||"
"Another fun fact is at the same offseason this was happening, Chris Paul was telling the Clippers he was coming to Houston with Dwight Howard if they didn‚Äôt hire Doc Rivers."
"there is no better opportunity to succeed than dunking a basketball with no defender in front of you.  Stop defending Ben lol  Dude lost the playoff single-handedly  As a point guard, if you shoot worse than Dwight Howard on the FT line, there is no excuse"
"&gt; If lebron averaged 25 10 10 AD average 30 16 3 (blocks) And KD averaged 30 5 5 ID say kd would be the 3rd best on the floor.   Well how is Harden doing? Because that statline clearly shows that AD is carrying Lebron if he‚Äôs that dominant although I seriously doubt Lebron can get 10 AST with Russ on the team. So if Lebron isn‚Äôt the best player on his own team, then it‚Äôs AD vs KD, and you can take 1 series but if you‚Äôre taking series is Dwight Howard better than Lebron in their primes? In 1v1 KD has the better accolades and stats. There is nothing AD can do this season to pass KD so in this rock paper scissors match KD is still the best. Unless ofc the Lakers blow out the Nets which they really aren‚Äôt capable of doing."
"&gt;Your answer is just for small market teams to‚Ä¶ be better.   Well obviously being better is good advice for anyone. But how about just ""don't be terrible"" as a standard to try to meet? Keep in mind, the Pelicans went years without a medical or training staff dedicated to the team, and they just fired a coach after one season. And that's before even getting to the stupid signings and trades they've made.   &gt; The truth is, large markets will always be able to draw way bigger talent   This is definitely an advantage that big markets have, but this doesn't mean small market teams are incapable of competing. There's really no substitute for great ownership and management, and big market teams definitely do not have a monopoly on that.   &gt;Most teams don‚Äôt get to turn Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, and a couple of draft picks for an MVP candidate  Two #2 overall picks, the #4 overall pick, two unprotected picks and two pick swaps is some kind of shit return now?  &gt; LeBron is already there because of the brand opportunity.    #1 the Lakers deserve all the credit for building that brand, and they did it through great ownership in Dr. Jerry Buss and great management in Jerry West, and they did this over decades. It didn't just magically appear. #2 the Lakers didn't just have ""brand opportunity"" they also had two max cap slots and the assets to trade for a third star. That's the kind of situation that is appealing to lots of players, even if the team isn't in LA.   &gt;Players don‚Äôt force their teams hands to leave for Milwaukee or Sacramento.   Like Jrue Holiday? He just wanted to go to a place where he could win, and after being traded from one small market in New Orleans to another in Milwaukee, he immediately signed an extension, and the reason is because the Bucks are run well.   My basic point is this: the Pelicans can't keep being poorly run and expect good players to want to play there. This is true for any team, even the Lakers. When Jim Buss was the Lakers' GM they were rejected by a whole slew of free agents and had Dwight Howard walk away in free agency. So even the Lakers can't expect to just get whomever they want if they're a poorly run team."
Dwight Howard trade
Dwight Howard loses 20 lbs every off-season! At the rate he's going he'll be -140lbs at the start of the season
"The crazy thing is that in his second rookie year he made 41 of 58 for 70.7%. Not great, but perfectly acceptable. Somehow he regressed to 25 of 73 for 34.2% in the playoffs last year, which would embarrass Dwight Howard."
"The Lakers had a GREAT defensive scheme for Joker.   It was McGee and Howard taking turns with AD and LeBron providing help sometimes.   Also... Joke is 280 (bigger than Big Country), and Shaq was between 300 and 320. That's not 50 pounds.   That's very similar to Sabonis, who gave Shaq a lot of problems.   And Dwight ain't small. He's over 260,, which puts him within 20 pounds of Joker. McGee is 270.   So let's not undersell one weight difference and over sell another.   &amp;#x200B;  Plus, Joker would demand Shaq to step outside his defensive comfort zone. He's have to let guys switch to cover the 3 ball because Shaq was always to slow to play in-out defense, the way Hakeem could do easily."
"Okay lol. Look at Dwight Howard, what did he use to dominate other than quick twitch muscles? You can say its a cultural thing, but China goes to extreme efforts to develop athletes and their basketball team sucks."
"While I do think run and gun was always the future (GMs stating so, stat nerds pushing for it), there's no way Oden would've gone the way of Hibbert.  If Giannis can have a tremendous career playing like how he has, especially in this past Finals (with Ayton in the middle, mind you), Oden could easily replicate his own version.  Remove Embiid and Jokic's three point shooting and they're still very effective players who you can't stop down low.  Lebron without a jumper is still Lebron (not like he relies on that jumper).  Otherwise, Oden had pretty good FT% for a big man and was working on a jumper before his injury.  The guy was faster than KD at the combine, had handles on par with Mike Conley, had an incredibly high vertical for a big man, could pass out of doubles, and had natural strength on par with prime Dwight Howard.  Run and gun is great for role players and star guards but I think you've just forgotten how an elite big man actually looks that you're mistaking them for random centers."
Dwight Howard took 20 3 pt attempts last year. Do you know how many Ben Simmons took?
Dwight Howard doesn't take threes. Is he mentally weak?
"The funny thing is that the Magic would use that blueprint to build the team around Dwight Howard during his prime as well, over a decade later."
"I think you‚Äôre missing the point, you‚Äôd be picking players based on their play for your specific team. You‚Äôd be getting Kevin Durant from his time as a net, not as a warrior. So Dwight Howard wouldn‚Äôt really count and Kevin Garnett would probably be taken out considering he wasn‚Äôt that good on the Nets. Also how can you call yourself a Nets fan and leave Dr. J on the bench lmao.  C Kenyon Martin  PF Kevin Durant  SF Dr. J  SG Vince Carter  PG Jason Kidd  James Harden only has 1 season on the Nets, I didn‚Äôt really think he‚Äôs done more for the franchise in that 1 season compared to Vince. I think if harden has 2 or 3 more great seasons and brings a chip to Brooklyn he‚Äôd have that spot in the Nets all time team."
Dwight Howard is 100% from the 3 in the NBA finals. Steph Curry who?
"We can run out a lot more stars than that. Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard (was a Net for one day), etc."
"C Dwight Howard (was on the Nets one day in 2018 before being waived)   PF Kevin Garnett   SF Kevin Durant   SG James Harden   PG Jason Kidd  Julius Erving, Kyrie Irving, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Andrei Kirilenko etc on the bench."
Damian Lillard Dwyane Wade Dominique Wilkins Dirk Nowitzki David Robinson  Dikembe Mutombo Dwight Howard Demar Derozan  Dale Ellis Dennis Johnson
Back in 2010 it was Dwight Howard for sure
It was perfect. Everyone watching the game including the Lakers thought the alley oop was going to Dwight Howard (because obviously) but it went back door to Courtney Lee lol
Some throwbacks that I could easily see here...  1983: Rick Mahorn (WAS)   1987: Kevin McHale (BOS)  1988: Bill Laimbeer (DET)  1990: Xavier McDaniel (SEA)  1991: Isiah Thomas (DET)  1994: Spike Lee  1995: Dennis Rodman (SAS) / Vernon Maxwell (HOU)  1996: Latrell Sprewell (GSW)  2004: Ron Artest (IND)  2012: Dwight Howard (LAL)  2014: Joakim Noah (CHI)
Dwight Howard from ten years ago
"Sorry but no statistics support your bullshit.                                    He wasn't succesfull in postseason because Mavs lacks another legit PG besides Luka of course. And this is supported by +/-  and by VORP.  He isn't some sort of Harden 2.0 who couldn't won championship neither with Durant and Westbrook ,neither with CP3 or Dwight Howard ,neither with Durant and Kyrie."
"Embiid has been defending Ben for 5 years and the whole org has been asking him to work on his deficiencies for that long of time as well. Most recently Dwight Howard and his challenge to Simmons to shoot more 3s. Eventually enough is enough though, especially if he is eating up max space on the cap."
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
"You replied to one part of my comment, read the entire thing i'm talking about every part of shooting  Free throw shooting is also not muscle memory, it's form + mental, in game it's much different because there is pressure  Dwight Howard was an 80% FT shooter in practice we have stats of Lakers practices, yet he is ass in game  Simmons is probably the same, he can drain 3s, mid range and FT in practice in game it's different, the level of NBA games, the pressure it's a completely different thing"
"i‚Äôve seen kat, dwight howard, KD, donovan mitchell in LA but i don‚Äôt think i said anything to them because of the setting."
Dwight Howard playing for the Rockets feels like it was 15 years ago.
If Dwight Howard starts shooting like KAT and passing like Jokic he'll have the longevity of Malone
"Ah yes, the game with the egregious Dwight Howard hold on Seth Curry‚Äôs jersey at the end of regulation that the refs didn‚Äôt call that cost the Mavs the game."
Top 5 team easily obviously the defense would be top 3 with Dwight. Millsap. Rondo. Etc. multiple defensive all timers. Offense would be top 7 MAYBE top 6. Offense would mostly consist of Dwight Howard post ups and for him to be used as the main focus of offense. Rondo could probably get back to top 5 at his position if he could average 14 or so assists. Plus the intangibles of bbiq and pure veteran knowledge will add multiple wins on its own. Definitely a dominant roster
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
I had a dumb fat high school coach who was about 5‚Äô5 and he swore Dwight Howard couldn‚Äôt dunk on him because he thought he was such a badass lol being a high school coach doesn‚Äôt mean jack shit
I think the narrative was our players were tired from the previous title runs so while it was disappointing it wasn‚Äôt as crushing. So there wasn‚Äôt a big deal made of it. And it was a hell of a series so it felt like a like a ‚Äúgo on and win your championship‚Äù type of moment.   Then we learned the next round that Josh Smith and Dwight Howard were teammates in AAU.
Lol Dwight Howard has a career FTr of .789
"i guess i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs at his best bc he gets to hit wide open looks bc of D Wade and Bosh. in cleveland, it just didn‚Äôt matter who was guarding him, whether it be 5 straight ECF Pistons, 3-time DPOY Dwight Howard, or best defense of all time ‚Äò08 Celtics  bron didn‚Äôt have to round out his game because it was way easier for him to just drive by you and then explode with the right hand. shaq esque dominance"
"No doubt...though watching Steph body and outrebound Dwight Howard under the basket was pretty satisfying, too. lol [Curry Bests Howard, Snags Offensive Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzszeBrAj5s)"
"We'd still have Billy King and a desire to make an splash in our brand new Brooklyn location so I feel like there'll still be some stupid trade for a ""household"" (aka washed) name that'll generate some buzz for us but set us back in the long run  Josh Smith (lol) or maybe actually getting Dwight Howard after going through the Dwightmare just 2 years ago?"

Dwight Howard game 6 of the 2009 Eastern conference finals against Lebron's Cavs. 40 pts 14 rebounds 14/21 FG. Dwight showed he could deliver in a big game and upset the King leading the Magic to the Finals for the second appearance in franchise history. I'm not a fan of Dwight anymore but I will never downplay his importance to the franchise.
"Game seven 2016 nba finals. LeBron James. My favorite game of his. Game sealing defensive play, let Kyrie eat, and like a 34 pt triple double with multiple clutch blocks and steals.    Lukas bubble winner in game four. Stepback on Reggie in OT for game and like a 40 bomb triple double.    Dwight Howard and Josh Smith game one in Houston, Dallas was visiting. I think 2013?. IIRC. They were just lobbing it up over Dirk all second half it was funny as shit and I've loved Dwight ever since.    Speaking of Dirk, fs his duel with KD in the playoffs, game one."
"&gt;How did the lakers suck  Did you look? The 2018-2019 Lakers were 37-45. Kawhi and AD moved in the same offseason.  &gt;which stars joined Kobe other thean Shaq and Pau  What a weird way to communicate. Instead of this silly exercise, let's list the stars that have joined the LA Lakers over the last 20 years.  * Russell Westbrook * Dwight Howard * Anthony Davis * Rajon Rondo * Karl Malone * Gary Payton * Caron Butler * Pau Gasol * Shaquille O'neal * Ron Artest * Steve Nash * Roy Hibbert * Lou Williams  I'm sure I missed some I'm just tired of doing this."
Dwight howard?
"He was actually on Duncan Robinsons pod recently and talked about it. Basically a ‚Äúif you let guys punk you, they‚Äôre gonna think they can keep punking you‚Äù  He also mentioned how Dwight does that shit every game ‚ÄúHe throw motherfuckers down every game, I watch him just toss them around, it‚Äôs not even a basketball play. You‚Äôre not finna throw me down‚Ä¶‚Äù  Funny enough, it was a weak push by Howard that sent him lmao, but I‚Äôm sure he saw Howard do it plenty of times in the finals so it was in his head a bit.  Pretty entertaining episode tbh  https://youtu.be/943BcpzGB2Y 2:34 mark on ejection"
Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard is the best modern day nba player that I could compare to cam Newton.   Both top tier players that they both got to their respective finals/super bowl and were the leaders of their team. Dwight was a perennial mvp candidate like Cam (Cam was able to win mvp once). His game was about elite athleticism and strength like Cam‚Äôs. He wasn‚Äôt/isn‚Äôt very skilled just like Cam. Then a back injury took it all away like Cam‚Äôs shoulder injury.
"Dwight Howard faded very quickly from dominance to irrelevance. He's younger than LeBron, yet his impact dropped off a cliff after he turned 26."
Dwight Howard ?
Dwight Howard
"&gt; As for the MVP, it is an award relative to the strength of your peers, and it is also narrative-driven, meaning it‚Äôs intrinsically flawed.  I'd argue this is an example of a good argument that doesn't actually help your case.   You're right that the strength of an MVP should be seen in the context of its time but your implication that Kobe faced more competition is wrong.  Bird had more competition in those years than Kobe. When we talk about Bird being Top 2 for 7 out of 8 years, the only year he came 3rd was because Jordan and Magic were 1 and 2.  Kobe never really faced that sort of competition.  &gt;Also if we are arbitrarily looking at Top-2 finishes, Bryant has 2 more Top-5 finishes.  During his prime, the **only** people who beat out Bird were:  * Kareem  * Erving  * M. Malone  * Magic  * Jordan  When it came to MVP voting, prime Bird only ever really lost out to consensus all-time top 20 players having one of the best years of their careers.  Kobe lost to guys like LeBron and Shaq but in his top 5 finishes he would also lose out to the likes of:  * Rose  * Dirk  * Jermaine O'Neal  * Stojakoviƒá	  * Nash   * Dwight   * Kidd  * McGrady  Still great players, but as you can see, he lost to a lot of guys Bird would never have lost to.    Along the way, Bird would beat out guys like Drexler and Wilkins. He would tower over young Hakeem, Isiah, Barkley and K.Malone.  Bird wasn't losing to a young Derrick Rose or Dwight Howard."
Dwight howard
"Since the 1982-83 NBA season, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Willis, Enes Kanter, Dwight Howard, Andrew Bynum, Kevin Love, Barkley, Mutumbo, Rony Seikaly, Michael Cage &amp; Charles Oakley are the only players to grab at least 30 rebounds in one game.  Dwight Howard &amp; Kevin Love are the only ones to score at least 30 points while grabbing 30+ rebounds in the same game.  Rodman had 5 30+ rebounds games in his career while Kevin Willis had 2."
Dwight Howard
"Draymond. Weirdly, also Dwight Howard. I think if given the ball more, he could kill. He's taken a smaller role, and seen his numbers go down. This is the same guy that averaged like 13 and 10 on 25 min just two seasons ago. And season prior put up 16,12, and over a block and a half a game. He's chosen to go for rings at this point. And don't blame him. But give him a mediocre team with minutes to spare, and he's giving you 12+ and 10 a game with a block a game. Easily."
"That surprised me so I just looked it up.  Theo Ratliff led the league a couple of times, Kirilenko once, and then Camby led the league for several seasons until Dwight Howard showed up."
This is similar to Dwight Howard too  Both also do the Superman
Dwight Howard.
And which one of his stints after Orlando showed the same Dwight Howard of the past.
"Hell, today's NBA would have trouble with prime Dwight Howard. Shaq would bowl through a lot of today's leaner stretch 5s."
Dwight Howard. Came in the league as ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù and now a backup or worse
Dwight howard comes to mind
This house is 9k SqFt for $19.6m.  Dwight Howard bought a 35k SqFt palace for $8.8m in rural Georgia.
Dwight Howard or Amare Stoudemire
"Yes, he was better than Dwight Howard and Carmelo"
"I‚Äôm not denying that Orlando Shaq could have been a great defender. he had the tools to be on the par of David Robinson and Dwight Howard. He just never put it together. By the time he was LA Shaq, he had a lot of bad habits and he himself said that his effort on defense was contingent on him getting shots and that he would take games off against teams that ran a lot of PnR. He was so good on offense it didn‚Äôt really matter."
Dwight Howard should have been invited to the 3 point contest
"Moments before Dwight took that dagger 3 he had a brief, yet consequential conversation with Vogel.  HOWARD: ""You want Philly Philly?""  VOGEL: (brief pause) ""Let's do it.""  Scenes from the Last Dance Lakers edition 30 years from now."
"15 all-defense and no DPoY is nuts.  Career overlapped with Mutombo, Big Ben, KG, Zo, and Dwight Howard.  That‚Äôs quite a list of defensive bigs.  He also split votes with his teammate, Bruce Bowen, which hurt him."
I wonder what the green light signal from Vogel is lmao  ‚ÄúStares at Dwight Howard intensely; show me what you got.‚Äù
"Pump and Dump... wait. That only applies to Dwight Howard, nvm."
What about Dwight Howard working out with Hakeem some years back?  Lmao
I lost a huge bet on FanDuel in the bubble season when my parlay was killed when Dwight goddamn Howard chucked up a garbage time 3 and made it.
I wasn't suggesting that dwight howard should practice kyries handles. I was following up on the OP. True improvement doesn't come from doing what you think is releasitic its from pushing the boundaries. The equivalent for Dwight would be like learning to block two players at once. It can't happen in a game but could help learn invaluable information about what is useful for blocking.
Dwight Howard has more 3s in the Finals than Shaq or Kareem. Checkmate.
Dwight Howard. Dude practicing 3‚Äôs and fast break hesi moves on his Instagram all the time lol
"Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard or Nurkic. Lol ok. Didn‚Äôt know Nurkic was a defensive savant. That Blazers team had no defense, we all saw it in the bubble and after."
Fun fact: I was at a Dwight Howard basketball camp back in 2011 and watched him make every mid-ranged and college three-pointer he took. No backboard required. Just swooshed everything. I said why tf can‚Äôt he do that in a game??
Dwight Howard must‚Äôve been shooting 3s in practice again.
So did Dwight Howard
"I can name everyone up to John F. Kennedy in the form of a song we had to learn for a post-911 national pride production we did in my elementary school. While I don't remember the tune past Kennedy, I know who the presidents were in between, and I remember the song ended with, ""...and George W. Buuuuuuuuush!""  George Washington  John Adams  Thomas Jefferson  James Madison  James Monroe  John Quincy Adams  Andrew Jackson   Martin Van Buren  William Henry Harrison  John Tyler  James K. Polk  and Zachary Taylor  Millard Fillmore  Franklin Pierce  James Buchanan  (loud) Abraham Lincoln(/loud)  (soft) Andrew Johnson  Ulysses S. Grant  Rutherforrrrrd B. Hayes  James A.

Kennedy...  ...and after Kennedy it was LBJ, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump, and Biden. I think that's 46."
Dwight Howard literally got shit from fans for smiling too much lmao
Dwight Howard-Too Much fun? Can the Magic‚Äôs dunk machine get serious for a moment? SI circa 2009
Dwight Howard got to much hate
"I‚Äôm going to push back on Smits. He might‚Äôve had a more versatile bag, but Ewing scored efficiently off his limited move set.   It‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs better on offense? Prime Vlade Divac or Prime Dwight Howard?‚Äù Vlade is literally better at each individual skill, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs better on offense."
"Lol at making it sound like Durant had the better supporting case that year  That's like saying ""the Lakers have LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, if they don't win it's the biggest choke in NBA history"""
Dwight Howard
He might do better on defense with Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard behind him instead of Enes Kanter.
So just because only three guys have won championships as a top pick means that it‚Äôs pointless to get a top pick? So Indy shouldn‚Äôt even try to get a Dwight Howard or a James Harden or a Kevin Durant because they didn‚Äôt win a chip with their original team? You didn‚Äôt even mention Kyrie Irving btw or how a ton of those top picks have brought their teams to the conference finals or finals‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs better to be a first round exit every year and take a gamble? You‚Äôre mentioning Giannis and Kawhi but it‚Äôs just a fact that it‚Äôs a lot easier to get star talent in the top ten every year than in the 15-20 range.
Because there were times in the series where he suddenly stopped driving to the basket and this stalled the Miami offense. And there were other times where Wade suddenly decided to take over.   I legit thought the way to beat Lebron was to station a Tyson Chandler or Dwight Howard type under the basket so his game wouldn't go as well as he could do it. Well 2012 happened and that was proven wrong.
"Haslem talking like he's going into Helmand Province did all this being ""uncomfortable"" just to play 2 minutes get bodied by Dwight Howard and kicked out the game for getting emotional LOL"
"What so I'm not allowed to criticize the heat because Simmons is sitting out lol? The points aren't related to one another, the Heat should make UD a coach and open a spot for someone that can give them more value on the court than getting tossed against Dwight Howard once a year"
"I honestly don't think Klay thinks in the way of ""I should make it over Dwight Howard"" but rather ""I should make it to the list. I don't care who else makes it, but I should make it"""
Very disrespectful to Dwight Howard üòÇü§£
"Can't get past a banged up Magic team who just played 7 games against a even more banged up Celtics team. That was the perfect chance for ""Bron"", but damn... Dwight didn't let him, isn't that sad? It obviously justify a cowardly reunion in Miami, also let's forget that ever happened because ""Bron"" is a dignified competitor, right? Howard was so mean, what a asshole"
"Yeah, with 4 turnovers and shrinking under pressure (as always). That's not enough, 65 wins in the regular season, the infamous Mo Allstar Williams, etc.. but of course, LeBron didn't had enough help to beat Dwight Howard, the poor guy. This historic revisionism related to LeBron is simply pathetic"
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."
"‚ÄúThere he goes.‚Äù Carmelo Anthony gave a look of absolute disinterest. Dwight Howard yelled ‚ÄúIs it still the preseason?‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Laker star Russell Westbrook put on skinny jeans and Urkel suspenders &amp; said, ‚ÄúDid I do that?.‚Äù"
"I genuinely don‚Äôt know why people have the idea that Westbrook has this amazing will to win.  People act like he‚Äôs this super competitive player who does whatever it takes to grind out a win, and honestly it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.    To me, a player who wants to win more than anything shows their competitiveness by constant improvement.  They identify their own flaws and work on them until they can‚Äôt be exploited.  Guys like Lebron, Steph, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, etc. all had gaps in their games that they filled in because they wanted to win.   Westbrook, on the other hand, has been the same player since KD left 6 years ago.  Despite being bounced from the playoffs esrly every year while having the same flaws exposed in his game year after year, he‚Äôs refused to make even the smallest adjustment for the good of his team.    He still takes twice as many threes as he should be.  He still turns the ball over like it‚Äôs his job.  He still shoots his team out of games even when he‚Äôs ice cold.  He still prioritizes grabbing easy DRebs over getting out early in transition (something that is just inexcusable when you have Lebron, AD, Dwight Howard, and Deandre Jordan who are all great rebounders who are more that capable outlet passers).  He still dominates the ball despite not being even remotely the best player or ballhandler on the team.  He still hasn‚Äôt even grasped the fundamental concept of offball movement.    Just because a player has a high motor and an aggressive attitude doesn‚Äôt make that player a competitor.   Thanks for coming to my TedTalk."
Ahh the team of misfits:  Mr.Anthony ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find me hobbling on the floor‚Äù Davis  Mr. Russel ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just jacking it‚Äù Westbrook  Mr. Carmelo ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me overrated‚Äù Anthony  Mr. Rajon ‚Äúthey call me tough‚Äù Rondo  Mr. Deandre ‚ÄúI just wanna be in LA eating veggies‚Äù Jordan  Mr. Dwight ‚ÄúI call myself Superman‚Äù Howard
Boban is the anti Dwight Howard loved by every franchise he has played for
"The circus might follow him. There‚Äôs a reason Dwight Howard went from best center in the league to passed around journey man and it was the internal drama he constantly brought to the team. It seems to be happening to Kyrie at the moment. That type of stuff has to be accounted for, ESPECIALLY if the guy isn‚Äôt even a top 10 player.   A player having the yips is just ANOTHER issue that has to be considered with Ben in a trade and another thing that would continue to crater his value. It‚Äôs compounding on top of each other. Guy has the yips and can‚Äôt handle the backlash, then demands a trade, which leads to an insane media circus where he sits out half the season possibly and he‚Äôs not even a superstar? There‚Äôs no way they all of that doesn‚Äôt affect how teams value him."
dwight howard got 2 blocks in the last game and didn't take his lebron approved 3 pointer so he is actually overdue and entitled to one today.
"What the hell is Dwight Howard doing with that ""beard""? That shit on his cheeks looks like absolute shit."
"Morey is the guy who orchestrated the CP3 trades (one good, one bad), the Harden trade, signed Dwight Howard, snagged multiple successful mid to lower round guys (Capela, Brooks, Scola), built a team that took the greatest team in NBA history to the brink.   And we‚Äôre the armchair GMs who know negotiation better than he does? I fully appreciate this debacle has reflected poorly on all sides, but it‚Äôs bizarre how we assume we just know more than what‚Äôs going on inside the room."
"I pulled everyone off the NBA website all time stats page. Seems like it doesn't have everyone who played in the NBA, only players who rank on at least one of the all-timer leaders list for individual stats. It's only 674 players, but it's a good place to start. I don't know where to get the data for everyone who ever played in an easily exportable format, so this will have to do.  The player from the dataset with the highest ratio of ft missed vs. fg made is Dwight Howard at 0.585.  4046 missed free throws, 6921 fgm. Shaq (0.469) and Wilt (0.457) are both in the top 10.  At the bottom of the list, Dell Curry (0.0454) and Steph Curry (0.0472) are #2 and #3. Kyle Korver was #1 and Steve Nash was #4. Seth Curry isn't listed in the data (he doesn't rank high enough on the all time lists for any individual stats), but calculating his manually, at 0.0484 he would fall between between Steph and Steve Nash. Them Curries sure know how to shoot the ball!"
LeTrader of Dwight Howard
"Chris Paul, Dwight Howard are the bigger than anyone Dallas has got.  Carmelo also requested a trade here in 2014 but Knicks didn‚Äôt want to trade him."
Dwight howard   next question
Any combination of 4 of the 75 + Dwight Howard would work for me
Never heard of hyperbole ?  Dwight Howard has taken a hand full or 3 pointers over the past few years. Functionally he still doesn‚Äôt take any cause he very very rarely does. Same thing applies to Ben
Like Houston doesn't? The only player who was star status who has ever signed with Houston is Dwight Howard. Next best is Eric Gordon.
"How old are you? Dwight's career with the magic alone puts him above AD. My main knock on AD is simply he's too young. But Dwight has one more All NBA First Team selection than AD (4 vs 5), TWICE as many All NBA teams, TWICE as many All Defensive First team (4 vs 2), all Defensive team selections (4 vs 5). Plus AD has never been a rebounding leader for a C/PF while Dwight won the award 5 times. Oh and he's only a 3 time DPOY. He was also second in MVP voting the year  D Rose won. Carried the Magic for years while AD could barely do similar when he was in NOLA. Howard certainly belongs on the list ahead of AD."
"Dwight Howard wasn't particularly refined in the post, but it's very hard to dismiss a guy who can score that many points on brute strength and athleticism.  I never thought Bynum was that ‚Äúgood‚Äù."
What has Dwight Howard done that is so much better than Davis?
Greg Oden vs. Dwight Howard will dominate the next decade (ca. 2008)
"No I think that's the way most judge players. For instance, Dwight Howard gets more respect for taking his 2009 Magic to the finals and getting their asses kicked than he does for winning a ring easily as a bench player ten years later."
Luka and Dwight Howard agrees
"When you look at this, it‚Äôs a lot closer than some people think. Through 2021, yes Dwight Howard has had the better career. But Dwight has played 17 full seasons and AD has played 9. Give AD 8 more seasons, and I think it‚Äôll look pretty clear.  https://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/anthony_davis_vs_dwight_howard.htm"
Lakers are undefeated since AD and Dwight Howard put hands on each other bodies in the huddle
Everyone on the list - AD + Dwight Howard. But for real its hard to make a list like this and there's probably 100 players I could put in a top 75. AD has an argument for it and I think it's fine he's on the list.
Refs have tossed Dwight Howard for less
Fucking Dwight Howard was 4/4 from the line lmao
"Exactly ha. If fucking Dwight Howard can hit a 3 pointer even after his twilight years every now and then then Ben can learn to hit a jumper from 12 feet. It was a lot of things that went wrong for him. Most leans on his lack of drive, but he was coddled, told he was great and those around him lowered expectations."
"My b, there was an old joke post trying to convince Dwight Howard to come to the Bucks in 2012ish?  And they ran down the roster, when they got to Ish Smith they just said ‚ÄúIsh Smith‚Ä¶ is a point guard‚Äù lmao"
I watched an entire season of Sixers basketball where Dwight Howard did this exact thing and was called almost every single time.   When a defender sets the screen then moves the leg out it‚Äôs a foul. By the books
"If Dwight Howard wasn‚Äôt on the list after 3 DPOY awards and dragging the *Magic* to the Finals, AD shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near it."
He got tripped by Robinson lol. Should‚Äôve been an offensive foul with how he stuck his leg out. But only Dwight Howard gets called for that lol
Bubble AD was better than any version of Dwight Howard. Just a way way better offensive player and just as good defensively. What AD did in the finals was just on another level to anything Dwight has done
Dwight Howard isn't a hall of famer. üòÇ
Dwight Howard is a crappy rebounder.
Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo don‚Äôt deserve the amount of hatred they get
That Dwight Howard is not a top 75 all-time player.
"I liked the adidas short sleeved jerseys.  Kawhi would possibly be a 3x champ by now with the Raptors had he stayed in Toronto.  Celtics would‚Äôve won Game 7 of the 2010 Finals if they had Kendrick Perkins. I rewatched the game and they couldn‚Äôt rebound for shit without him. So many second opportunities for LA.   Derrick Rose was never bad before his career resurgence in New York. His first Knicks run, Wolves, and Pistons runs were all pretty decent. He just wasn‚Äôt MVP level so he had super high expectations. The only exception was his Cleveland stint but that team was a ticking time bomb before half the team got traded.  The 2009 Magic get too disrespected. They were way ahead of their time in play style. They had great 3 point shooting and prime Dwight Howard.   George Hill deserves just as much blame as JR Smith for losing Game 1 of the 2018 Finals. No missed free throw = no JR situation   Lebron being on Kobe‚Äôs team will always feel wrong to me. He could be in LA another 4 years and it wouldn‚Äôt matter.   The Grizzlies have the most consistently clean jerseys in the league   The NBA needs to relocate the Pelicans. They will forever be a dead in the water franchise as long as they‚Äôre in New Orleans with that stupid name"
I can't believe he made NBA 75 but Dwight Howard didn't.
"""But I'm a top 75 already."" AD to Dwight Howard"
Dwight Howard doesn‚Äôt seem to have the reputation but he‚Äôs become a fouling machine since his athleticism left him with nothing but being a piece of shit
"Not sure if they‚Äôre unpopular, but I got a few hot takes:  Supermaxes are useless. They either do nothing to keep the players or cripple small-market teams salary caps and prevent them from building around the player  Lakers-era Shaq would be ran off the floor by pick and rolls in today‚Äôs NBA (pre weight gain Orlando Shaq would be fine)  Dwight Howard would be a top 10 center of all time if he didn‚Äôt injure his back  Allen Iverson would be better in today‚Äôs era than he was in his own  Iso ball is fun to watch"
"-The NBA contracts need to change in some way that doesn‚Äôt allow players to secure a bag and then force themselves out. James Harden or Ben Simmons wanting out is fine by me but there has to be some sort of disadvantage to leaving your team like that. It just seems too lopsided in the players favor.  -Grayson Allen to the bucks was one of the best off-season acquisitions. As a SEC basketball fan I don‚Äôt like him but damn, he can play D shoot 3s and doesn‚Äôt commit costly turnovers. I would say he might be the 3rd most important acquisition behind DeMar and Lowry.  -speaking of DeMar, no one talks about how he just got a career high in assists last season because he was in SA. He is an all star.   -Brandon Ingram and Zion don‚Äôt work well together.  -the second half Anthony Edwards rookie season showed he‚Äôs most likely all-star bound sooner rather than later  -Russ was right about P Bev. He‚Äôs just running around fooling everyone. He doesn‚Äôt really bring anything to a team.  -Dwight Howard was elite in Charlotte"
"Do you think it‚Äôs untrue? On the offensive end he‚Äôs literally never improved from his rookie performance. In terms of shooting, fucking Dwight Howard attempted more 3s than him last season, and he shot 34% from the free throw line in the playoffs.    He had several flaws on the offensive end coming into the league, and he‚Äôs somehow regressed even more In those areas as his career has progressed. He‚Äôs a great defender, and he‚Äôs improved in that regard, but if you‚Äôre going to be the starting point guard on a championship contender with a max contract you have to have more value on offense in the playoffs than Andre Roberson. Literally all of his weaknesses are things that he SHOULD have at least shown a tiny bit of improvement on at this point but he hasn‚Äôt. Meanwhile Embiid has completely changed his entire game to better fit with Ben and guys like Seth Curry have made massive improvements to benefit the team."
How do Magic fans feel about Dwight Howard?  He's probably one of the 50 greatest players all-time (despite the 75 list).  Howard had his best years with the Magic but the departure from Orlando was one of the cringiest and uncomfortable in NBA history.  Lakers &amp; Rockets the other two team he made All-NBA with are definitely not retiring his number.
"That's KAT'S personality.   Rah Rah Rah at the start of the season. Then a little adversity, he folds. He's really really good getting his numbers though. Really reminds me of Dwight Howard. Except KAT is likeable.   He's destined to be a 2nd or 3rd star."
ESPN: did the scuffle between Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard effect the bucks locker room?
He would have made it if he played more minutes. The Bulls are playing him more. Not surprising since Vogel is the type of coach to play Deandre Jordan over Dwight Howard.
so wild that he's in and dwight howard isn't
"Lebron, Russell Westbrook, AD, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan  Vs.  Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Harrison Barnes  Why is that questionable?"
The Dwight Howard method: pick up former all star vets and hope that they have their best bench season ever.
Top 75 over Dwight Howard. Crazy
Think this was it: [cavs fan ate a shirt after they lost the finals lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ltddo/i_promised_i_would_eat_my_shirt_if_the_warriors/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  [also this guy who said he'd eat a Dwight Howard poster if he didn't have great season (he did tho)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g6x1yi/8_moths_ago_i_said_id_eat_a_dwight_howard_hornets/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
Dwight Howard
The Dwight Howard of his era.
"James ran Westbrook out of town, and CP3, and Dwight Howard‚Ä¶. This team tried 3 times to build around Harden, and typically within a year Harden would be over it and demand they start over.  He owns a lot of the blame."
Dwight Howard or Udonis Haslem
"poor harden, the rockets only gave him dwight howard, chris paul, and russell westbrook to play with!"
2011 Dwight Howard was a complete beast.
"That's actually Draymond point.   He thinks/knows there is more to the story for why Ben Simmons doesn't want to play for the 76ers and requested a trade. But, all that is touted is ""Ben Simmons doesn't want to play, trade him!!!"".   So the media skews the conversation to Ben Simmons drama instead of sharing more about how the game is played, complexities of the NBA , twisting players words to create drama (how many replays, posts and conversations were had about Dwight Howard and AD when that is a spay between two players and they obviously squashed it).   He's saying the media shouldnt speculate and perpetuate drama. They should share the love for basketball they claim they have, and use the platform for good (Barkley's mini soliloquy on the vaccine the other day was very good)."
Dwight Howard for sure deserved it over Klay.
still not better than Dwight Howard
"I mean yeah, it‚Äôs Dwight Howard"
and forgot Dwight Howard...
Meanwhile Dwight Howard was a fucking 3x DPOY and carried his team constantly in the playoffs. I think Dwight is annoying af but even has had more impact on basketball and pop culture than AD
"Klay‚Äôs going to channel prime Dwight Howard? Man, the league is fucked."
*Dwight Howard has entered the chat*
austin reaves must be thinking he's going to wake up any second lmao... literally in the game with teammates lebron james russell westbrook dwight howard and carmelo anthony
The Memphis grizzlies have a tough young team. Incredible tenacity. No softies on a badass team like the Grizzlies. The lakers allow softies on their team. Dwight Howard? Soft AD? Soft DJ? soft at a discount.
1. Bill Russell 2. Hakeem 3. Dwight Howard 4. Ben Wallace 5. David Robinson 6. Tim Duncan 7. Ben Wallace 8. Rodman 9. Pippen 10. Garnett 11. MJ 12. Gary Payton 13. Kawhi 14. Tony Allen  Maybe he's 15th all-time but I probably forgot some older players.
09 ECF  Not top 76 player Dwight Howard destroys Lebron
"Simmons is a self absorbed Pu**y who didn't turn up to play. Westbrook played on during the losing casue against the sun's, while AD and Dwight Howard had handbags at dawn on the bench lol. At least Westbrook plays hard unfortunately theres no stats for that"
Listen to your parents   Work hard in school   Dwight Howard sucks   And always be good
"Is he without a doubt?  Kawhi, Scottie Pippen, Rodman, Bill Russell, Tim Duncan, Hakeem, KG, David Robinson, Ben Wallace, Mutombo, MJ, Gary Payton, Dwight Howard, Kareem  Draymond is in that group but idk if he‚Äôs without a doubt top 10. Not to mention he‚Äôs only had 7 seasons as a starter in his career so he doesn‚Äôt have longevity on his side."
"The 12-13 team's main issue was injuries that year. Dwight Howard was coming off back surgery and probably shouldn't have even been playing to start the season, then fucked up his shoulder halfway through the year. Steve Nash broke his leg in the second game of the year and suffered permanent nerve damage because of it (he was never close to the same after that), and Kobe of course tore his Achilles tendon that season."
I don't think its even just r/nba its just the general popular opinion among nba fans in general. He has some flaws but I think he's suffering through dwight howard syndrome where people think hes worse than he is simply cause they don't like his personality
Yeah agreed . The biggest issue is not changing and reducing the earlier guys . I still think it should be like 5 guys /decade base or something so we don‚Äôt ignore them. But they don‚Äôt always deserve equal representation every decade . The amount of competition and just the level of the game is WAY HIGHER now. Then back then. Pay respect but be realistic that half those guys don‚Äôt deserve it over Dwight fucking Howard. It‚Äôs not fair to current guys competing in a global talent pool with far more players.
I mean look at Dwight Howard. He has 5 kids with 5 different women lol
"Maybe but when Guys like Parker(FMVP) , Ginobili , Dwight Howard (3 DPOY) , Draymond, English etc didn't make it. I honestly fail to see a single argument for Kyrie."
"Lol no way Zion makes top 75 since he hasn't really accomplished anything yet. My point is more like why is Dave Bing, who was 7 allstars and 3 all nba selections in over someone like Dwight Howard, who has 8 allstars, 8 all nba, 3 DPOY and played in a stronger era."
People are in disbelief that anyone could ever be friends with Dwight Howard
"Not really. Players like Dwight Howard or maybe Klay would be more likely to be there.  In his favor, Rubio is very often overlooked as a great PG because he's spent most of his career in pretty bad teams. His passing is fantastic, but what always hurt him has been his lack of strength and his shooting, while good, is not as much a threat as other guards.  Rubio had hype like Luka when he was drafted and he never quite lived up to it. Playing many years on the Timberwolves certainly stunned his growth, it's a terrible franchise.  One last thing that did not help was how on the first few years his head was not in the game. He wrote a good article out about his mental health concerns, mostly feeling alone in the States and his mother's cancer taking a toll."
Dwight Howard for Melo swap
"&gt;You‚Äôre comparing stats like ADs best days are behind him.  I'm not. I'm saying there's no way AD should be on that list over Howard given their careers thus far. I'm going based on facts, not what ifs. Facts are, AD is made out of glass. No amount of talent is going to magically make him healthy.   &gt;AD is just entering his prime and will have a better resume than Dwight did when it‚Äôs all said and done.  This is your opinion which you're entitled to but it's not a fact.  &gt;ADs talent is better and he‚Äôs already a champion and was 2nd best player on a championship team.  I agree but Dwight at his best was the best player on a Finals team...a team he led to the Finals, not riding the coattails of another superstar, not saying AD did, but Dwight didn't have any superstars on that Orlando team.  &gt;AD could‚Äôve won DPOY 2 years by now but finished 2nd in 1 and top 5 in the other.  More would've, could've, and what ifs.  &gt;AD also played with a team with not much help and had to carry the offensive load while still being their best defender.  And Dwight didn't? Who was 2nd best player on those Orlando teams? Hedo? Rashard Lewis? Pietrus? Jameer Nelson? Stop acting like Dwight was surrounded by stars or something. If you want to say he doesn't have the offensive skill set that AD has, then yes I'll agree, but even then Dwight was still leading his team in scoring, while also being their best defender and rim protector. He led in scoring, rebounding and blocks lmao stop with the excuses and what ifs. It's possible he can finish with a better resume, but outside of getting more rings or a Finals MVP, I don't see him winning DPOTY once, nor three times IMO, but as it stands right now, Dwight has had the better career and resume, point blank. And this isn't a knock on AD, his health is what has held him back thus far. I'd be shock if AD is still playing at 35 with his injury history, but you never know."
if Dwight Howard and T Mac can‚Äôt make the list‚Ä¶Klay Thompson shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near it
"54 year old man arguing with millennials about how he could have a body like Dwight Howard the 6‚Äô10 nba star that clearly uses HGH and other supplements that would cause him not to be ‚Äúnatty‚Äù. This is fucking hilarious, I‚Äôm imagining my dad hopping on Reddit, arguing with people my age (25) and posting pictures of his body to prove‚Ä¶ absolutely nothing haha. I‚Äôd lose all respect for him lol that‚Äôs so childish"
Dwight Howard in shambles
"Guys who didn't make the list that I'd take over AD off the top of my head:  - ZBo - Marcus Camby - Dwight Howard - Ben Wallace  AD is Amar'e territory of too frequently injured to be considered on a best of list.  He's a ""what could've been"""
"Man, are the Lakers a mess already? Rondo being a psychopath and Dwight Howard getting pushed around my AD‚Ä¶. Bron better tighten up that locker room."
"AD is a champion... that pretty much trumps Dwight ""Off the bench"" Howard. Dwight is on AD's team."
Your version is more pointless. You're comparing fictional versions of players against each other. Some serious mental acrobatics to pretend George Mikan wouldnt get eaten by Dwight Howard.
I think it's more criminal that Dwight Howard didn't make it in than Klay.
"He lucked out and came along as DeAndre Jordan/Dwight Howard were the model of a 5 in the league. Rim Runner/protector, and the Warriors were coming off that We Believe era and Biedrins was their only big along with undersized David Lee"
"Please Vogel if you wanna keep your job, USE DWIGHT HOWARD HES STILL A BEAST WHEN UNLEASHED"
‚Äúmodern medicine‚Äù  A discectomy was still a discectomy when Dwight Howard had his.   MPJ has now had 3. He‚Äôs done.
Was Dwight Howard the missing piece?  Kinda looks that way tonight.
"Bullshit. Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, and Rajon Rondo are all on the active roster.  That right there is more star power than the entire Kings team, meanwhile we're missing Harrison Barnes and (much less importantly) Marvin Bagley."
Vogel straight despises Howard.  Its personal.  Wonder what Dwight did
The Steve Nash and Dwight Howard trades. Set us back 7 years
Rose is probably the 3rd best player (when healthy) of the past 15 years   Behind Dwight Howard and lebron James
Dwight Howard - 71.4%
Just like Dwight Howard and Larry Johnson after their back injuries?
The coolest shot blockers were Dikembe Mutombo and Dwight Howard.  The most valuable shot blockers were probably Bill Russell and Hakeem Olajuwon.
"I would be be happy for him if he won tho. Carmelo, Westbrook and Butler too. I was  happy when Dwight Howard and Brook Lopez eventually got their rings. Cousins was a great player and I enjoyed watching him on Kings and Pelicans with AD before the injury.    So many greats ended their careers without reaching the summit despite all they did for the game like Barkley, Malone, Ewing, McGrady, Carter, Wilkins among many others. Ring chasing is not that bad."
"Spot on! Even Prime Dwight Howard back in 2009,10 etc was an absolute beast back to the basket player. When Centers use their strength to get right under the basket it‚Äôs just so efficient. Magic made a finals appearance for a reason"
"All-Coaches 5v5. Coached by CP3 vs Rondo; reffed by Anthony Edwards, Dwight Howard, and Rasheed Wallace."
"Dwight Howard, Clint Capella, Josh Smith, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza is by himself?"
"Wait, *third*? Man is approaching Dwight Howard levels of back surgeries."
"I don't know about y'all, but when I got into basketball whenever you blocked a shot you'd always yell Dwight Howard (basically a 'Kobe!' equivalent). So I'm going with Dwight."
I thought it was Dwight Howard with 70%+
How about Dwight Howard leading in 3P% with 71.4%?? (players with 5 or more attempts)
"seems like their biggest problem right now is team defense, AD can give you stretches of DPOY caliber work but he struggles to put together complete games at that level especially when he's also carrying a large offensive burden  carmelo is carmelo he's never gonna be a good defender  westbrook is a very flawed defender, he can do some good stuff off ball but he can also kill you by losing his assignment and ballwatching  and lebron has honestly been dogging it on defense this year when he does play, he's earned the right to take it easy in the regular season but he's still a negative on that end  avery bradley is generally solid at least and can be trusted to take big minutes  dwight howard gives them by far the most consistent defensive effort night to night but I suppose it's unclear how many minutes he can play per game  deandre is deandre"
Stretch 5 Dwight Howard shooting 71% from the field.
"lakers young core of dwight howard, deandre jordan, melo and pick swaps of course ü§£"
"Nah I don't like that narrative. ""11-9 in a weaker Eastern Conference"" but let's look at their L's in that period.   They lost to the Boston Celtics twice who were 2nd in defense that season along with maintaining their big 3 core. Paul ""Shitting don't make sense"" Pierce was still leading his team to a 56-26 record.  They lost to the Hornets who were spearheaded by prime CP3 and had 6 scorers averaging in the double digits while also being in the top 10 defenses.  They lost to the Utah Jazz who had the interior dominant presence of Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson along with a prime D. Will and the jackknife defender AK47.   They then lost to the bully ball Memphis Grizzlies with ZBO and Marc with Rudy Gay being the up and coming 20 point scorer. Not to mention they had Mike Conley and Tony Allen which made them a perimeter nightmare.  After the rodeo in the west they came back east where they got beaten by a Pacers team with a prime Danny Granger, the chonkosaurus defensive presence of Roy Hibbert, and the consistent backcourt of Collison and Dunleavy.   Then they lose to the big daddy Dwight Howard team who would go on to have a record of 52-30. They had 9 players that season averaging double digits and Dwight was still in his dominant prime.  And finally, they lose to Dirk ""The Mullet"" Nowitzki. Their team wasn't just top 8 in both defensive and offensive rating, but they had Jason ""Wife Beater"" Kidd along with Terry, Marion, Butler bringing up the rear.   That '11 Heat team wasn't losing to scrubs and more importantly, they won the match ups that were clearly in their favor. This Lakers team has been losing to random people and a situation where you have Westbrook, AD, and Lebron and LOSE to a Kings team should never occur."
Potentially debatable.  I submit as evidence this Curry rebound over Dwight Howard:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzszeBrAj5s
George Hill and Rodney Hood play for Milwaukee. Harris counts for Brooklyn (and I guess Kyrie technically? Idk lol).   But also the streak can‚Äôt technically end until he retires since he could end up playing with players after they make the finals (like Dwight Howard who counts for 09. (although the window for this is closing).
The Lakers have Dwight Howard on a minimum shooting 71% from deep
Bloody hell. Giannis is approaching peak Dwight Howard physique.
"&gt; Dwight led the Magic to the finals &gt; And Dwight led a team to the finals &gt; consistent championship contention  Then what happened ?  We are talking best of all time. Not good, not great. Howard ain't on that list."
Blake can take on the Dwight Howard goon and rebound role.
"Dude, what the hell are you talking about? You've got to be trolling at this point...  &gt; Ben Wallace was his team's defense anchor  So was Dwight, he was the best defensive anchor in the league.  &gt; and was actually part of a winning team.  Dwight led the Magic to the finals  &gt; Howard during his peak was undeniably great, but he could never figure out how to take those talents and be part of a winning team.  Again, he was the defensive anchor and best offensive player on a team that went to the finals.  &gt; Because individual greatness is tied to how great you make your team, over time.  Agreed, Dwight was so great he led a team to the finals and consistent contention with a supporting cast of Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis, and Hedo Turkoglu  &gt; Howard finally figured this out to be a bench player for a bubble ring, but that's not enough to salvage his career.  He led a team to the finals."
"With his injury it‚Äôs usually laminectomy or discectomy. The spine is basically bones with discs in between for cushion. Laminectomy is shaving down some of the spine bone that is pressing into the spinal cord. Discectomy is shaving the bulging parts of the disc that are pressing into the spinal cord. These aren‚Äôt quite as bad as they sound. I had a laminectomy and you straight up walk out on your own not many hours after surgery, although it‚Äôs hard to say how long until you can play at an NBA level. Many athletes have had these two surgeries a ton of times. Tiger Woods and Dwight Howard have had a few for example.  The more serious surgery is fusion, where you remove the disc completely and fuse two sections of bone together. I have also had this and this is about as long as a recovery can be. I had to wear a back brace for six months and not bend during that time. Unlikely this is what he had at this time. Usually this is a last effort. Using the Tiger woods example, he had three discectomies before finally having a fusion.  But yes, it can basically be boiled down to removing stuff in your back and hoping it fixes the problem. Maybe it accomplishes nothing, maybe you are better for a few months, or maybe better for a few decades. But the problem is likely never gone."
It's not always about the amount of blocks you get either. Dwight Howard only led the league in blocks a couple times but he was the best shot blocker in the league for close to a decade. He just didn't get the same amount of opportunities as other players because no one would shoot in the paint if was nearby.
"I think it would have to depend on the person receiving the pass as I was saying.  If you pass to a wide open Klay Thompson on a corner 3 where he probably shoots over,50% it would count as a ""good shot"" maybe giving like .5 assist in addition to the 1.0 from making it (while still getting the .5 even if he misses).  You'd have to know the statistics of each person but I don't think that would be that hard to find with today's tech.  And on the other side, passing to a double-teamed Dwight Howard from 3 would only get you you 1.0 assist if he somehow makes it, because it's not a good shot.  Could even say that whether that shot is made or not still counts as nothing, with the players shot percentage from where they take it dictating the amount of points they get from the pass.  After typing this I have realized that I didn't take player development/slumps/ start of a season into consideration.  This is probably a lot more difficult to measure than I initially thought."
They should play Dwight Howard and Deandre Jordan at the same time and have them run the pnr.
He clearly has been doing lateral raises in the off-season. That‚Äôs the key. Just get Dwight Howard boulder shoulders
Everyone talks about Dwight Howard being a clear snub from the top 75. But Draymond Green also deserved to be there. Both guys deserved it clearly over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.
"Hey now, that‚Äôs Dwight ‚Äú71% from Deep‚Äù Howard we‚Äôre talking about"
"It‚Äôs unfortunate but I predict a similar thing happening to the Kobe-Nash-Howard lakers did in the 2012-2013 season. At BEST Lakers get 6th seed and play the Jazz in the first round which is still tough. That would require them to be nearly perfect the rest of the season though and other teams to flounder.  Then we have the most likely scenarios...Lakers end up as 7th or 8th and a few games above .500 and Lakers get in because they get two play-in games. But then your first round opponent is going the be the Warriors or the Suns...in that case these teams both know how serious of a threat Lebron is so they absolutely try to crush them as quick as possible. Like they know even letting the Lebron get 1 win on them would be a mistake and those teams seemed incredibly locked in right now and I don‚Äôt see that changing come playoff time. In fact both teams are getting Better as the season goes along.   That‚Äôs what ‚Äúturning it around‚Äù probably looks like. Honestly it will only be because of the Talent of Lebron,AD,Westbrook and Melo that they are able to stay in the 7th/8th spot. Any other team with less talent in your position would probably fall to 11th seed.  That being said...I would love to be wrong about this. It‚Äôs going to sadden me to see Lebron spend his last years in the same position Kobe was in. More importantly is the question what do they do next season? One current issue with the team is they traded all their depth and consistency for star power. Only 3 players returned from last season and i guess 5 if you count Rondo and Dwight who are talented but...if Lebron,AD and Westbrook can‚Äôt move the needle those guys also won‚Äôt.  That brings me to the next question. What will they look like next season? Because all the ring chasers aren‚Äôt going to stay and I‚Äôm sure a few members will retire/go to another team if they really want to keep playing.  Because here‚Äôs the thing...after the 2013 playoffs and with Kobe‚Äôs injuries the Lakers didn‚Äôt make the playoffs with him again. Are they going to actually get a good supporting cast this time in the offseason and will AD take a leap and be better than Lebron? More importantly...is Westbrook staying?"
"Not to mention he got a T, which Poole converted at the line. Essentially he transformed his massive block into a Dwight Howard trip to the line and proceeded to piss Poole and all the Warriors in the process..."
I mean maybe if Dwight Howard shot more of them‚Ä¶
"I love Ben but if the list is supposed to be about top basketball players, individually, then Dwight probably would be ahead of him. They built teams around Howard, while Ben was a key piece on a well built team."
Kuz picked this up from Dwight Howard
"I know right. Dwight Howard was still in his prime too so that could have been huge, big fettering uguodala just glued our whole team Together in a way that still continues now.  Like even Marc Jackson, he might not have been the best coach ever, but some of the things he did I think were crucial in setting the groundwork for what this team has become"
"Kinda funny how things work out.  We tried to sign Dwight Howard, but if we got him, who knows how that would've worked out."
Idk but someone really needs to get Dwight Howard some shorts that fit him. He needs a size or two bigger.
AD secretly a Dwight Howard fan.
"Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony. All examples of superstars who had declined heavily by 32. How good you were at your peak has nothing to do with how you'll age."
"Yeah, David Stern manipulated the league so the Spurs would win 5 titles because they were so exciting. And we never saw Kobe vs Lebron because obviously Dwight Howard and Hedo are a better draw."
"A young socialite would struggle in Portland.   Also, Dame is the epitome of less drama, Simmons has managed to summon a Howard-esque level of it in less time than Dwight. Depending on his next team, he could pass Howard as king drama baby."
Apparently the reason he didn't re-sign (and the reason Dallas didn't get Giannis) was because the Mavs thought they could sign Dwight Howard in free agency üíÄ
"I will never stop believing he is incredibly overrated. With him as the Pelicans‚Äô best player they did absolutely nothing as a franchise. Then he got a ring by teaming up with the greatest player of his generation. He‚Äôs basically Kevin Love. The best player on a really, really shitty team who puts up big numbers because someone on the team has to score and rebound and only wins when he gets carried like a big ole ugly ass unibrowed backpack by the best player in the world. Nobody can convince me otherwise. He ain‚Äôt top 75. Dwight Howard, however, you can‚Äôt convince me isn‚Äôt."
Washed?? Lmao‚Ä¶ they just look washed cause they tried to stack their team with no system or chemistry and too many egos. Warriors out there sweeping the west with g leaguers lol but Lebron Westbrook ad Dwight Howard and melo are just a bunch of scrubs eh
Prime Dwight Howard is unironically a great answer to this question though.
Apparently prime Dwight Howard if he‚Äôs not even in the top 75.
It was ridiculous then and much even more now.  Dwight Howard must be stewing.
"The amusing part is that Dwight ""not top 75 and AD is"" Howard is shooting from 3 better than him."
"Ask Vogel to stop being a coward and unleash Dwight ""Stephen Curry"" Howard. 71.4% on 3s for the year."
"Howard by far in the first one Rodman was an ass offensive player and Dwight despite his limitations was way better, plus Dwight was an elite defender Rodman would never score  Noah in the second one because of size, neither are great really but this depends on which Draymond if it's prime where he could hit some jumpers he could win"
&gt;Melo is easily their best 3 point shooter.   The disrespect to Dwight Howard who is 71% for the year
Ben Wallace &gt; Dwight Howard. Both should be in top 75. Both should be in the Hall of Fame. Obnoxious how long it took Ben to get that nod.
You mean he wouldn't be chomping at the bit to reunite with Dwight Howard in LA?
I still feel that Dwight Howard is the biggest waste of potential ever. Nobody has a build like him and his athleticism is off the charts. If he only took basketball seriously and worked on his offense he would have changed the game.
"Imagine someone told you a team with Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rondo, Trevor Ariza and Avery Bradley lost to the Kings"
"People expected Dwight to do what Giannis did.   I think he might have a point, in what world is ring-less Lillard better than Manu or Kyrie or Pau Gasol or Dwight? How's non-MVP Lillard better than Howard?  Having said that, it could be his antics out of the court that prevented him from being listed, he acted unprofessionally when he left Orlando (the Van Gundy episode was tasteless), and some voters might remember that.   I saw more people complain about Manu's exclusion, because we all think having one Manu is better than having one Dwight, so yeah, complaining about this is kinda soft."
Thank you for the Dwight Howard psychoanalysis
"Tell that to Luka, Blake Griffin, Giannis, Dwight Howard, etc.   He can‚Äôt even pull half the shit he‚Äôs done in his very short career in China which is where he‚Äôll end up. Bush-league ass player"
"Anthony Davis made the NBA 75  team over Dwight Howard, so it can't be that ugly people are being underrated."
Longevity and a place in the top 75 over Dwight Howard apparently lol
"Raw number comparisons without context?  **Try this one on for size:**  Dwight's career missed 3's: 76  Curry's career missed 3's: 3,836  Dwight Howard missed fewer 3pt shots in his career than Steph Curry, so dWigHT hOWarD iS a beTTeR SHooTER."
In a city full of sports heartbreak Dwight Howard is in the top 5 of my most hated opponents.
"The question isn't about who has the better career, why would you assume everyone is an idiot because you can't read?    Lavine being ""only recently a true star"" and Booker being on bad Suns teams is entirely irrelevant.  Swap Mitchell and Booker's careers out, put Donovan on those trash Suns teams, you think they are going to the playoffs?    You are acting like people asked, ""Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, or Greg Oden"" and everyone was saying ""Cut Howard."""
"Look at Dwayne Wade early in his career. Or Dwight Howard. Derrick Rose. Anthony Davis.   Hell, even Kevin Durant. They all came into the league firing, and none except *maybe* Kevin Durant are considered top 10 players, and Durant was far better in his first few years than Luka was."
"Ehhh FMVP, 4x All NBA, 10x Allstar, #16 all time scoring regular season, #22 all time playoff points  There‚Äôs lots of guys on the original list who are worse than Pierce and a few that shouldn‚Äôt have made it in the 75th. The Truth is probably #65 all time ranking and Dwight Howard is top 50"
Dwight Howard has more career points then Stephan Curry. I am aware he‚Äôs older then curry but my point is that we all know Stephan Curry has a crap ton of points and is the most elite shooter in the NBA. It‚Äôs easy to forget how dominant Dwight Howard was because that was over 5 years ago so might even not exist in the brains of the people on this sub. In conclusion Dwight is low key kinda good at basketball.
Dwight Howard sux
"Shaq was insanely better than Dwight Howard.  Dwight has gotten a bad rap, but let's not swing too far the other way.  Dwight isnt even a top 3 big man in lakers history."
Dragging your team to the finals through a prime LeBron is much more than Dame has done.  Dwight Howard is also an NBA champion.
I absolutely hated Dwight Howard for a few years during his prime and that's how I know he belonged in the top 75.
"&gt;‚ÄúMy intention when I first left Orlando was not to go to L.A., and the Magic knew that, but despite my wishes to go somewhere else, they sent me to L.A., which was one of the places at that time that I did not want to go. I felt like it would have made people feel as though I was trying to follow in somebody else‚Äôs footsteps,‚Äù  This little bit adds so much likeability to Dwight Howard that I never knew was there."
"Shaq never got 15 rebs and was not close to the defender Dwight Howard was. Shaq also never led the league in rebounds with all his size, strength and athleticism."
Dwight Howard in his prime era was some of the most exciting nba basketball in the modern era. He deserves his roses
We definitely can't sleep on those Dwight Howard rumours coming out and then the next game being DTD with a butt issue.
Don‚Äôt talk about 2020 NBA champion Dwight Howard that way
"AD and Dame are great players but their achievements pales in comparison to everyone else who was left out. You have Pau Gasol, Tony Parker, and of course Dwight Howard who could have easily replaced both."
Dwight Howard wasn‚Äôt getting shit on nearly as much when he was good. That‚Äôs why he won 3 straight DPOYs. He got shit on once he stopped being a winning player
"Dwight Howard and Tony Parker should have both been on that list over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. The one was the face of a franchise (Dwight for Magic) and was legitimately a top-5 MVP player during his peak years, while the other (TP) was a 6-time all-star, 4-time champion, and a finals MVP -- not to mention that TP is among the leaders in playoff points in the paint, **as a point guard.**   Anthony Davis has only won one 'chip and has not even been the FMVP of that series and Damian Lillard has never reached the peaks of Parker's career yet they are in the 75-team really just shows that they were popularity votes and not legacy votes."
So you think Dwight Howard should of gotten a flagrant when hit he Sabonis in the face then right?
"You guys get back to me when AD, for all his talent and skill, carries a franchise anywhere meaningful without LBJ.   He‚Äôs talented for sure, but as he is playing in what should be his prime years, I feel comfortable saying he‚Äôs not dominant, durable, or consistent as Prime Dwight Howard was."
"I didn‚Äôt change any criteria? I said I didn‚Äôt agree with the way they did the list (which you also expressed), but since this is the way they chose to do it, it makes more sense for Dwight to make it over Lillard (which is where we disagree). Dame cannot reach the career accolades Dwight has gotten at this point in his career. You brought up shaq‚Äôs inclusion and compared it to Dame and AD. I said that wasn‚Äôt a good comparison and explained why I felt that way. At no point did I go back on anything I said. You can frame what I wrote however you want, it doesn‚Äôt change what I said.   Shaq was literally an all star his rookie year. You brought up first team all nba, but if we‚Äôre being honest, Lillard has 0 if Steph doesn‚Äôt get hurt. Dwight has accomplished more than dame could ever hope to, but if Lillard being better than Dwight Howard is the hill you want to die on, then I won‚Äôt stop you.   And I do think that barring injury, Luka will be a better all time player than Dame. That isn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion.   If you want to talk basketball, I‚Äôll do it all day. But if you want to attack character and call people sad and hilarious when they disagree with you, then that‚Äôs not the type of person I‚Äôm interested in having an insightful debate with."
Dwight Howard and Cam Newton are cut from the same cloth.
Dwight Howard smiles after he gets technical fouls that hurt his team's chances.
dwight howard face turn
"Shaq averaged 27 and 11 in that 4th year and was barely in his prime. That‚Äôs the difference, and it‚Äôs a big one. Shaq, at that point, was on pace for top 15 all time. And then he proved he was top 15 (minimum). Dame is on pace for player we barely talk about about in 15 years. There‚Äôs maybe a 5% chance he ends up a better career player than Dwight, and that‚Äôs why people are upset Dame made over Howard."
"Please explain how Dave Bing is better than Dwight Howard then. Or Dave DeBusschere. Hell explain how Rodman was better, I am very curious what the argument could be."
"Aa a magic fan, I still resent dwight howard.  As a basketball fan, it is criminal how alot of people forget how dominant of a force he was in his prime"
"Absolutely. The fact that Dwight Howard is not on the list and Anthony Davis is, is a travesty"
Dwight Howard and Orlando
Any list of a top 75 that includes both Anthony Davis AND Westbrook but NOT Dwight Howard is effin ridiculous to the point of not being worth talking about.   Dwight is the patron saint of cornballs but the disrespect to his impact on the game has to stop.
Lol he definitely was. I remember there was an ESPN Outside the Lines episode all about Dwight Howard and how he wanted to ledgit Change the NBA logo to have a cross on it.  This was his rookie season. He changed pretty quickly because in a few years he knocked up a chick from the Mia heat dance team.  And that same girl said Howard never came to visit his son once. He just gave her checks.
"No other team could have sent us what we got for Howard.  The trade ended up being very complicated, but the gist is:  Orlando sends Dwight Howard, Chris Duhon, Earl Clark to the Lakers, and Jason Richardson to the 76ers.  Orlando receives Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Moe Harkless, Josh McRoberts, and Christian Eyenga and 1 contingent 2014 1st round pick from either the Nuggets or Knicks, 1 protected 1st round pick from the 76ers, 1 protected 1st round pick from the Lakers, 1 protected 2nd round pick from the Nuggets, 1 contigent 2nd round pick from the Lakers.  Yes, we managed to completely fuck up and are once again rebuilding, but it was a really solid trade on our end since Howard wasn't going to stay under any circumstances."
Dwight Howard was the problem  Clint capella was the problem Chris Paul was the problem  Russell Westbrook was the problem  The whole team is the problem so they reformatted and PJ fucking tucker was the center...PJ tucker?? He was always the problem
dwight howard...?
"&gt;Allen looks like he could be special on defense.  Again, not all that rare for that position.  Just look at how cheap players like Noel, WCS, or Dwight Howard signed deals for.  All of whom are slightly worse or slightly better than Jarrett Allen.   &gt; Since you're going to be playing against Embiid, Jokic, and AD - having a center who can actually play some defense against them has plenty of value.  Allen can't compete against any of those guys.  The way you defend against those centers is with team defense and properly executed double teams.    This isn't the 90s anymore.  One on one defense isn't really how it works."
"Lmao what? You think a team of Lebron, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Dion Waiters, Danny Green, Kuzma, Caruso isnt a great team? Thats legit a super team lmao what the fuck do you want on your team 8 superstars?"
"if Drummond played to his strengths I would agree. Unfortunately we've already played the ""What if the theoretically dominant PnR guy stopped posting up and lazing around on D"" game with Dwight Howard a couple years ago. Not really interested in trading for him and then feeling obligated to hand him a giant contract while he sleepwalks to an inefficient 15/15 and shit defense."
"You mean like having Harden and Dwight Howard, or Harden and Chris Paul, or Harden and Westbrook, or KD and Harden and Westbrook, or KD and Westbrook, or Westbrook and Paul George, or Kawhi and Paul George, or I think you get the point."
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"&gt;I mean, yeah you exploit what you can. Curry gets targeted on defense in the playoffs and we don't doubt that he's a great player; dude just happens to be relatively weak in that area.  Simmons isn't just a relatively weak shooter; he's not a shooter at all. He has no ability to shoot, nor does he try to. Not analogous; Curry is a bad defender, but he doesn't literally just not play any defense whatsoever. Curry would literally have to hid behind the stanchion and let his team play 4 on 5 defensively to compare to how bad Simmons' shooting is.  Also, Curry's had the best defensive unit around him EVER to compensate for it... Klay, Iggy, Draymond, KD, Livingston, Barnes, Bogut, Javale all at some point in their title run... are you seriously comparing the two?  Simmons would need an all time shooting lineup around him to compensate for his lack of shooting.... like Draymond. He'd literally need Curry, Klay and KD lmao  &gt;The realistic hope is that Simmons can eventually hit 3s at an okay clip when left open.   Hopefully he finally tries to even learn to shoot... but it's doubtful he ever will get much better at this point. If he can even shoot 30% on a decent sample size, that's a win... but I doubt it.  &gt;Dwight Howard made the Finals without a jumpshot, just sayin  Simmons can play Center? At an All-NBA defensive 1st team rate (as a big man, not just forward)? Simmons can be a Top 8 Center of all time caliber player?  This isn't even mentioning.... guess what... Dwight had amazing spacing and the best shooters around him... a common theme for stars who can't shoot.  Cmon man, what kinda comparison is that lmao"
"I mean, yeah you exploit what you can. Curry gets targeted on defense in the playoffs and we don't doubt that he's a great player; dude just happens to be relatively weak in that area.

"&gt;The team was hamstrung because of moves James wanted to make blowing up repeatedly  This is just a lazy way to look at it.  It wasn't Harden's fault that Dwight Howard wanted to post up instead of run the fuckin Pick &amp; Roll. He literally refused to run it. He wanted to post up and get his stats in losing efforts.  It wasn't Harden's fault the team had a tiny ass rotation in 2018 because they held onto Ryan Anderson's contract, or that CP3 got hurt against the  KD Warriors when they were up in the series.  It wasn't Harden's fault that when he averaged 35 against the KD Warriors the next year that CP3 was putting up games shooting 20% from the field when every game was decided by 6 or less.  And it wasn't Harden's fault that WB was hurt all playoffs this last year and STILL looks like shit.  Y'all are so thirsty to look at results and just go HARDEN BAD but none of yall paid any fuckin attention to what happened."
"Honestly, I'd take Terrence Jones, Motiejunas, Ariza, Pat Bev, JET, and Dwight (assuming you're talking about 2014-2015) over Anthony Parker, JJ Hickson, Mo Williams, Boobie Gibson, and the weird old Ilgauskus/Varejao/old Shaq rotation with no hesitation. I'd also take them over Eric Snow, Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, Sasha Pavlovic, and Ilgauskus.  Howard and Ariza were at least two really, really good players at the time, with Dwight being All-Star caliber still."
This is some wild revisionost history. You're forgetting they held onto that Ryan Anderson contract KNOWING he was unplayable against the team they needed to beat because they refused to attach picks to it (the ones they still had for the WB deal later on). It wasnt just about not willing to spend salary. They cheaped on trading assets too.  To.blame the Dwight shit on Harden is just blatant trolling. Howard wanted to post up and wouldn't run pick and roll.  CP3 got hurt when they coulda won and then was injury riddled all year.the year after.  WB was hurt the entire playoffs. Harden never asked for WB to be shipped out.  Your attempt at blaming all.that on Harden is dumb. You're so delusional that you're making up events to validate your whinging. Pretty sad.   RoCo and CP3 were never on the Rockets at the same time btw
&gt; three solid second bananas    Surely you're not including Dwight Howard?
"How do you mean completely reactionary?  Everyone knew when they signed the Chris Paul and Dwight Howard contracts that they were going for high risk high reward win now moves that required spending large amounts of money.  Those were proactive attempts to bolster the roster around James Harden, and in no way reactions.  If anything, they reacted quickly by trying to retool to actually take advantage of James Harden's prime.  They sign a contract for Dwight Howard to get a great player for James Harden to play with.  BUT, James Harden can't play with him. So they ship him out.  BUT, James Harden wants to win now. So they sign a massive contract with aging and injury prone Chris Paul to win now cause he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, James can't win with Chris Paul his first year. So they try to retool the team. They get the hottest 3-D guy on the market in RoCo and hope for a runback.  BUT, james can't win with Chris again and starts to dislike him. So the team ships him out and further leverages their future for Russell Westbrook because he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, this style doesn't work very well. So they retool the team. They ship out capela and go true small ball.  BUT, they still don't win. James gets grumpy and wants his new friend shipped out again.  And, now, the rockets have a very grim future and James Harden blames the Rockets.  And its not like they havent had competent players on their team throughout James Harden's tenure. PJ Tucker has been a shining example of an amazing contract in the league and Eric Gordon outside this past year was a fantastic second/third option.  They had their chances and blew it. Whether that was bad performances, bad luck, bad timing or a mixture of all three is beyond me, but I don't think its fair to say the Rockets weren't trying and spending for it too.  Rockets fans like to point to not resigning Trevor Ariza after the 17/18 season as an example of the poor management of the Rockets and their refusal to pay up.  But I just don't think Trevor Ariza is the difference maker between a winning team and a losing team.  I think the rockets could have spent more. But I dont think its fair to say they needed to.  In 2018-19, the Raptors spent $11 million more than the Rockets and won the NBA championship.  In 2019-20, the Lakers spent $13 million less than the rockets and won the NBA championship."
Jones and Motiej≈´nas never started together full-time for an entire season. Unless you count the year Dwight Howard was injured. But he still had Dwight Howard on his team.  Also Jeremy Lin and Pat Beverly were his point guards before CP3. Neither are slouches. He also had Chandler Parsons before he became a full-time model.
The Dwight Howard 3+9 route. Lol.
One of the first red flags to me about Harden was when he said everyone on the Rockets but him and Dwight Howard were expendable. I'm not sure why a bigger issue wasn't made out of that.
"Bale is an elite dribbler, or at least was before his golf days.  He probably couldn't do the close control in traffic against elite defenders like Iniesta. But he can run with the ball at an elite level.  Of course he has the physical gifts but it's not the kind of physical gifts that someone like Dwight Howard has. He still has to develop the touch, shooting, passing etc to be a Real Madrid level player."
"So are we really gonna come out and blame Harden for wanting good players/coaches? Getting Dwight Howard when he was still one of the best centres in the league was a no brainer. Trading a bunch of role players for CP3 was also an easy decision. Trading for Russ was more iffy, but CP3 was so terrible in the 2019 playoffs that it was clear they needed some kind of change.   And what were they supposed to do, keep JB Bickerstaff as coach instead of hiring D‚ÄôAntoni? MDA was an excellent coach in Houston."
Lol no he‚Äôs not. Dwight Howard in Orlando was an absolute monster. No center has dominated like he did since
"The comment above doesn‚Äôt even matter since 95% of people won‚Äôt see it, that‚Äôs the problem we have now with the media we have anyone saying anything and it‚Äôs taken as true by a majority like with Dwight Howard"
"I did not expect the mature, stable, complementary, team centric Dwight I have experienced over the past 18 months.    (Minus ""[I don't believe in vaccines](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2900846-lakers-dwight-howard-says-he-doesnt-believe-in-vaccines-amid-covid-19)"")."
"Let's not act like Houston didn't try to give Harden everything, as well.     Houston's front office tried giving this man **everything.**     Dwight Howard   Mike D'Antoni   Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   etc.  Swishout goes into detail about this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ffUJy1sJxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ffUJy1sJxY)"
"True, but how often has Harden decided, ""this isn't a good team"" and pulled stuff?  I'm sure Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall all feel like Harden gave it his full effort. /s"
"I‚Äôve completely lost all respect for Harden. Woefully underperforms in the playoffs, every year they‚Äôre overhauling the roster trying to match him with superstars - Chris Paul, Westbrook, a million shooters and vets trying to keep him happy, even Dwight Howard back when he was great. Then to come into this season as heavy and out of shape as he is shows he doesn‚Äôt give a shit. Then to perform like he did last night and come out blaming the roster? Saying they don‚Äôt have any talent? Fuck off dude."
"Ben actually hurt bro, you could see him visibly limping. And Embiid was clearly healthy enough. Sixers coming off heavy minutes while the league let your guys sit at home and rest. You fucking think Danny Green and Dwight Howard were notable mentions, fucking lol"
"Jokic can't even guard Dwight Howard, how the fuck is he supposed to defend Embiid? Embiid &gt;&gt;&gt; Jokic."
"And y'all had embid, simmons, Danny green, Dwight Howard.........."
There was one questionable call for Embiid. You must have missed the first half when Dwight Howard had like 3 horrendous foul calls either not given for him or given against him
Dwight Howard is one of the most persecuted athletes by the officials in sports
"&gt; You‚Äôre just wrong and don‚Äôt understand basketball.  &gt; It‚Äôs evident most people on the sub are ignorant about the nba.  &gt; It‚Äôs 2021. Offense is valued over defense.  &gt; Let‚Äôs play a game here of what would you rather have with health not being a factor:  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Kristaps Porzingis?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Vucevic?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or KAT?  &gt; You take each of these centers over Gobert based on overall skillset.  &gt; Gobert is considered a better defender than all of them, yet we wall know he‚Äôs worse than all of these centers because he‚Äôs complete ass on offense.  &gt; Being highly skilled on offense and below average on defense is by far more valued than highly skilled on defense and below average on offense. Also, all the centers I listed aren‚Äôt terrible on defense either, just slightly worse or moderately worse than how Gobert is perceived.  &gt; Come playoff time, Gobert and every other unskilled offensive big man are useless on offense and a huge liability.  &gt; The Deandre Jordan/Dwight Howard centers are a thing of the past now.  So people know what this tantrum post is in reference to. This dude is upset that I didn't agree with him."
Dwight Howard gets out first
"We don‚Äôt really have 9 players bc 3 of them are centers. Bradley literally can‚Äôt play unless we wanna run Dwight-Embiid and Bradley lineups which is laughable. We had to play Embiid-Howard lineups for several minutes last night and it was ridiculous. Mike Scott is also recovering from a knee injury so if player safety is paramount he can only go for a set number of mins in his first game back and shouldn‚Äôt be playing a b2b right away after recovering.   Against Miami, Boston had the 8 players ready to go, so why is the game against Orlando cancelled??"
"i think harden is a great example. both exploring the media push through the turn. even in a microcosm with the trade stuff there was a hilariously ridiculous turn. when the harden trade first happend the media started talking him up, then immediately after realizing houston was trying to get good value the media did a 180 and starting slandering him to lower his trade value. finally after it seemed like he really is most likey to stay in houston they just kind of quit trying to push a trade. for a full career trajectory the media turned on harden when he repeated what dwight howard said in that they were the corner stones. dwight left harden to hang when harden only repeated what dwight said. and the media attributed it solely to harden. so harden took all the blame for dwight's ""leadership"""
What if with Tmac  1. What if he didn‚Äôt leave Toronto  2. What if Tim Duncan Signed with the magic  3. What if Tmac got traded to the lakers  4. What if Tmac stayed on the magic with Dwight Howard  5. What if Grant Hill never got Injured  6. What if Yao and Tmac were healthy    Tmac is one of my fav players and it‚Äôs sad to see how his career could have been with all these rumors and scenarios. The two main ones that interest me are the lakers trade (confirmed by jerry west) and the Tim Duncan signing. He could have legitimately been a part of two dynasties and alas he retired early with no rings on the end of the Spurs bench. Heartbreaking

"I think the most underrated ""What If"" in NBA history, that was actually somewhat likely to happen too, is ""What if the Golden State Warriors completed a sign and trade for Dwight Howard signed in 2013.    They don't have the cap space to sign Igoudala, they probably end up trading Klay Thomspon to free up salary space and definitely don't run the same type of offence and have the same type of success as they did in with Stephen Curry, Pre-KD. As a result they don't truly unlock their maximum potential and different teams get an opportunity to win a championship. KD likely doesn't go to Golden State, which you could argue sparked the current player empowerment era, and the NBA over these last 5 years looks completely different."
"Dwight ""The Babysitter"" Howard"
Better than the Dwight Howard Lakers billboard that just said ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù Like he was a damn puppy.
"I think for as long as Dwight Howard is in the NBA, he'll have the best body of any center. He's #2 all-time behind [The Admiral](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/19/31/34/1931346eaab37ecd1d03a95c823ee0fb.jpg)."
"Yes, let's let it be the game where Danny green was the back up point gaurd, Dwight Howard played powerforward, and Isiah Joe, a YMCA player from Perdue, and Paul Reed got major minutes be the deciding factor"
Let's say it'd be roughly the equivalent of an NBA expansion team getting Kevin Huerter and having him average 29ppg and getting Dwight Howard and having him be a DPOY candidate
"&gt; 2007-2012 era of Centers was pretty damn weak. The big brutes that Shaq had faced in his prime were all gone, and the super athletic guys hadn't come into their prime yet. &gt;  &gt; Shaq's opponents during that time, woulda been Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard, ZBo, Ilgauskus, Mehmet Okur, Rasheed Wallace, Duncan, Chris Anderson, Tyson Chandler, Larry Sanders, Al Horford, Kendrick Perkins, Elton Brand, and some other foos I can't remember.  Ilgauskas was big, so was Okur.   Pau wasn't a C, it was Tsakalidis/Wright in MEM and then Bynum/Dwight in LA.   Zbo wasn't a C either, that'd be Joel Przybilla in POR, Eddy Curry in NY, Marcus Camby in LA, and Marc Gasol in MEM.   Elton Brand didn't play C either, Chris Kaman did.   Larry Sanders was only relevant for 1 season, and even then he played less than 2000 minutes that year.   Chris Andersen was a backup, Nene was the starter.   I dunno why you're listing a bunch of PFs and backups, but whatever.   If PHX wanted to run P&amp;R all day, they already had Amare, one of the best P&amp;R bigs ever. Why would they want ""skinny Shaq"" as the roll big when Amare was already elite at it?   &gt; But imagine a slimmed down Shaq running Pick and Rolls with Dwade instead of Joel Anthony. That duo might be able to run through Boston in 08.  08 Miami lost 67 games. Even prime Shaq isn't taking a 67-loss team to the Finals, let alone a 35yo Shaq, no matter what he weighs. Neither could prime Jordan or prime Lebron or prime Jesus."
Dwight Howard would've fallen into the same trap
I think I saw an highlight of him dunking on Dwight Howard
Dwight howard looking like üëÄ
"Kobe's idea for Shaq's in-shapeness probably would be physically impossible.   Imagine being Shaq's size, working out and running all summer and dropping let's say 30 pounds and getting his BF down considerably.   Now you're playing 40 minutes a night, plus practices. But ideally by the time you're in the playoffs you actually want to be maybe 20 pounds heavier.   It's way easier to start off the season with some extra, play your way into shape, and then by the time you're in the playoffs you're feeling the best you've felt all year long.   The only issue really happened when he was past his prime. After the 2007 season when he couldn't play as many minutes, he couldn't play as many games, he wasn't as effective, he was noticeably slow and easier to take advantage of.   Tim Duncan began to drop a lot of weight as he got older. This allowed him to stay on the floor, play in a faster paced offense, and rely less on posting up and backing down.   If Shaq had gotten skinnier (instead of fatter) instead of becoming a journeyman he probably could have become the league's best Pick and Roll partner, and actually been a much better defender as 2007-2012 era of Centers was pretty damn weak. The big brutes that Shaq had faced in his prime were all gone, and the super athletic guys hadn't come into their prime yet.   Shaq's opponents during that time, woulda been Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard, ZBo, Ilgauskus, Mehmet Okur, Rasheed Wallace, Duncan, Chris Anderson, Tyson Chandler, Larry Sanders, Al Horford, Kendrick Perkins, Elton Brand, and some other foos I can't remember.   But imagine a slimmed down Shaq running Pick and Rolls with Dwade instead of Joel Anthony. That duo might be able to run through Boston in 08."
Dwight Howard was at his absolute peak when he was eating huge bags of McDonalds and following it up with a pound of chocolate. Apparently he's corrected his diet at this point and lost some weight. I don't know where I'm going with this.
"Umm, how about Ron Artest, Dwight Howard(probably the best peak defensive player, 7yrs), Scottie Pippen (better than Jordan), Ben Wallace, Bruce Bowen, Kawhi Leonard, etc etc"
Yea I wasn‚Äôt really focusing on the ‚Äúthickest‚Äù aspect. I‚Äôd have to say Dwight Howard or Karl Malone. Really no other possible picks.
"I‚Äôve seen this exact foul get called a flagrant 1 when the guy was in the fucking air because Dwight Howard was the one that did it, soft call"
Aka Dwight Howard
"Wasn't [this](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24863899/kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-apologizes-saying-earth-flat) the last time he's really talked about it?  That's a pretty clear apology and from over 2 years ago at this point. Has he really doubled down on it since? I couldn't find anything.  Honestly, conspiracy theories are a thing that a lot of people gravitate towards, especially during certain times of their lives - we know there's a lot of athletes who do so as well (eg, Steph having had a similar opinion on the moon landing in the past, or Dwight Howard seeming to believe some QAnon stuff, etc). It's just that Kyrie is an easier target and more likely to speak his mind on things like this, along with seeming more eccentric - so it's stuck to him more."
It‚Äôs not that serious bro. That Dwight Howard shit is kinda too personal and makes a person (Howard) look bad so I don‚Äôt deal with that type of shit.
Doc said they were told they would have to forfeit the game if Mike Scott didn't dress. He also then joked that Dwight Howard would probably have to play point guard...
Don‚Äôt forget starting pg Dwight Howard!
Yet they made the Sixers play with Dwight Howard as PG lol
"&gt;What kind of dumb ass strawman argument is that? No, he took less shot because Tony Parker became a much bigger part of the offense, no teammate since Robinson in Duncan's rookie year took more shot than Parker did from 03-04 onward.   Parker was not more efficient than Duncan.  Guess it was lucky for Duncan that he had All-star guards to lean on -- wait, wasn't that my original point?  Sure enough it was.  &gt;Plus Pop really started managing his minutes, he never played less than 39 minutes a game before 03/04 after he never played more than 35. Less minutes plus deferring to other players is why his shots went down.  Too bad he didn't have Robinson around to make those minutes easier.  Wait a minute, damn, that was my original point again wasn't it?  &gt;Rik Smits really?   You said ""Any All-star big from that era"".  If you want to retract your offer, it's too late.  Think and/or research first next time, if you don't want to be wrong.  &gt;Robinson, Malone, and Olajuwon were an era before Duncan  Now you are just getting pathetic.  You said ""from the 90s/2000s"" and now you want that back as well?  Pretty soon you'll be down to ""Duncan was the best player who started his career in 1997 and retired in 2016"".  &gt;Garnett's efficiency went up in Boston because his usage went way down, notice as his ppg and shots per game went down his efficiency went up.  And yet the same didn't happen for Duncan.  &gt;Pau was never the scorer Duncan was, Pau topped 20 ppg only twice in his career, Duncan did it nine times.  Duncan did that just twice without David Robinson distracting the defense -- and only just barely.  So yes, Gasol actually was at least the scorer that Duncan was, and in fact, was better.  &gt;If you want to argue at Dwight's 4 year peak in Orlando from 08-12 he was better than Duncan at the same time I won't argue that, Duncan was 32 and 11 years deep into his career. He peak doesn't match Duncan's peak though and outside of those peak Orlando years, Dwight doesn't even come close to comparing to Duncan.   The only thing Duncan has on Howard is longevity and much better teammates.  Howard was far better defensively, and scored as much, on better efficiency throughout his twenties.  Howard did not sustain that in this thirties, but he's no contest the better player in his twenties.  Howard -- like Robinson and Leonard -- anchored a top-rated defense, and did so with mediocre-at-best teammates.  Something Duncan never managed.  That said, you're off on some tangent here.  We were discussing how inefficient Duncan was offensively.  &gt;Dirk wasn't more efficient than Duncan,   You'll have to acquire a familiarity with numbers if you wish to continue here.  Duncan's career effective FG% was .507, and Nowitzki's was .512.  512 is larger than 507, you'll be surprised to learn.  &gt;Then you must be watching something completely different than literally every other fan, sports analyst, and player who played against him and said how great he was.  No, I just pay more attention."
"&gt; Or couldn't get quality shots against more attention. I suppose you probably believe he just stopped shooting as much to avoid embarrassing the opposition or something, but I sincerely doubt that.  What kind of dumb ass strawman argument is that? No, he took less shot because Tony Parker became a much bigger part of the offense, no teammate since Robinson in Duncan's rookie year took more shot than Parker did from 03-04 onward. Plus Pop really started managing his minutes, he never played less than 39 minutes a game before 03/04 after he never played more than 35. Less minutes plus deferring to other players is why his shots went down.  &gt; Any big? Are you sure about that? You might want to retract that offer in a minute.  &gt; How about O'Neal and his career .582? Left him off your list, didya? Or Robinson, and his .519? Or Dwight Howard and his .565? Or Amar'e Stoudemire and his .538? Or Alonzo Mourning and his .529? Or Karl Malone and his .516? Or Olajuwon and his .513? Or Pau Gasol and his .513? Or Rik Smits and his .507? &gt;  &gt; And for that matter, during the few seasons in Boston when Garnett had something resembling Duncan's supporting cast, he shot 53-54% despite being in his mid-thirties by then. Nowitzki was also more efficient than Duncan despite substantially more volume and attention. &gt;  So, Duncan was more efficient than Chris Webber and matched Rik Smits. Wow, I am whelmed. Is that all you've got?  Shaq is the most dominate low post scorer and efficient low post big man ever, not gonna argue that. Rik Smits really? Might as well say Gobert, DeAndre Jordan, Tyson Chandler and Hassan Whiteside are better than Duncan because their FG% is in the 60s. Robinson, Malone, and Olajuwon were an era before Duncan, I was comparing him to his contemporaries. Garnett's efficiency went up in Boston because his usage went way down, notice as his ppg and shots per game went down his efficiency went up. Pau was never the scorer Duncan was, Pau topped 20 ppg only twice in his career, Duncan did it nine times. If you want to argue at Dwight's 4 year peak in Orlando from 08-12 he was better than Duncan at the same time I won't argue that, Duncan was 32 and 11 years deep into his career. He peak doesn't match Duncan's peak though and outside of those peak Orlando years, Dwight doesn't even come close to comparing to Duncan. Dirk wasn't more efficient than Duncan, Dirk shot over 50% twice in his career. Even if you take into account 3 point shooting and free throws, that doesn't close the gap on how much better Duncan was as a rebounder and defender.    &gt; Almost every seven foot professional basketball player suffers back pain.  Yeah, and once it becomes a chronic issue, they start to become a shell of their former selves &gt;  &gt; Weren't you just saying he was never the same after an injury at 23? And how his unremarkable results without All-Star teammates should be ignored, because he was over-the-hill at 32 by then?  He was never the same athletically after 23, so in that sense we never got to see his skill combined with his peak athleticism, that's a scary thought actually now that I think about it. Wouldn't say unremarkable, but yeah eleven years into an NBA career, most players aren't the same as they were at their peak, especially big men.   &gt; I watched him play, and he wasn't that great. Again, we've plenty of numbers to support that. He was exceedingly lucky to be drafted by a team that won 60 games repeatedly without him, and who reloaded with a number of All-Stars during his career. Otherwise, he'd have nowhere near the undeserved reputation he has.  Then you must be watching something completely different than literally every other fan, sports analyst, and player who played against him and said how great he was. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"&gt;He took less shots after 02/03 season.   Or couldn't get quality shots against more attention.  I suppose you probably believe he just stopped shooting as much to avoid embarrassing the opposition or something, but I sincerely doubt that.  &gt;His FG% always hovered around 50%, even with Robinson. I don't know why you think that's somehow inefficient, if you look at the other All-Star bigs during that time they all shot high 40 to low 50%. Look up KG, Dirk, Webber, Rasheed Wallace, or whatever other All-Star bigman from the 90s/2000s you want to compare him to.  Any big?  Are you sure about that?  You might want to retract that offer in a minute.  How about O'Neal and his career .582?  Left him off your list, didya?  Or Robinson, and his .519?  Or Dwight Howard and his .565?

Is that all you've got?  &gt;He had chronic back pain the rest of his career.  Almost every seven foot professional basketball player suffers back pain.  &gt;Who said we never got to see his full potential?  Weren't you just saying he was never the same after an injury at 23?  And how his unremarkable results without All-Star teammates should be ignored, because he was over-the-hill at 32 by then?  &gt; If you watched him play you saw it, you're really trying to say he wasn't that great because he played with an old injured Robinson and Bruce Bowen?  I watched him play, and he wasn't that great.  Again, we've plenty of numbers to support that.  He was exceedingly lucky to be drafted by a team that won 60 games repeatedly without him, and who reloaded with a number of All-Stars during his career.

Where Dwight Howard is attempting threes but Ben Simmons refuses
"Lowkey think it‚Äôs part of him being a leader and showing Ben he can just fucking shoot. If Dwight Howard, one of the most dominant paint players of all time, can shoot 3s in his 17th season, so can you Ben.   He‚Äôs really embraced the leadership/mentor role, I‚Äôm so happy he won a chip with the Lakers."
We‚Äôre living in a world where Dwight Howard is attempting 3s. Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I just think it‚Äôs pretty crazy how much the game has really changed.
Yeah Dwight Howard and LaMarc Gasoldridge are the only older active dudes his size.[¬π](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/players)
"The Lakers' trade for AD was far more frontloaded than the Clippers' trade for PG. All the Lakers still owe for that trade is two 1st round picks and a pick swap that it doesn't look like will ever be used. The Clippers, on the other hand, [still owe most of this shit.](https://i.redd.it/gablumavxti51.jpg)  But in any event, the Lakers' bench last year was far from ""trash"" as they didn't make any meaningful trades to upgrade it, and instead just added Markieff Morris on the buyout market. Last year's Laker bench had KCP, Caruso, Rondo, Kuzma, and Dwight Howard on it to start the year. Eventually KCP moved into the starting lineup when Avery Bradley didn't go to the bubble, and the Lakers picked up Kieff."
"If they were going to be honest, Dwight Howard. I get his perspective as a high school player entering the league, becoming a star player, MVP type of player, trade requests, how the style of game changed as his career progressed, interesting teammates, Kobe, the change from star player to being unwanted, almost out of the league, to successful role player, bubble, his personal life.   Seems like a man with a 1000 stories."
Yeah he was given the Kobe green light just because the alternative was Danny Green or Dwight Howard trying to create their own shot.  He was still playing and scoring in garbage time lol.
After tonight he shall be known as Dwight ‚Äúthe point god‚Äù Howard...
Dwight Howard is the best center on the floor dont @me
"Against 4 rooks, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Tony Bradley. He should have double that."
"All they have to look up to is the finesse of Dwight Howard.  Oh, and he eats Embiid for breakfast and they just can't stand that."
"Everyone flops and exaggerates, even Bron. That‚Äôs irrelevant, even the 6ers announcers were complaining about Howard doing silly, unnecessary shit. Did Joker exaggerate the push? Probably but Howard is a goon and there was no reason for him to push from behind, the refs are always going to call that.   &gt;	You‚Äôre acting like Green and Dwight have been Sixers for more than 10 games  What does that have to do with anything? The team that either Green or Howard is on is irrelevant they both play the way they play."
"Clearly said he hasn‚Äôt been good this game, which is 100% true when he‚Äôs playing against Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley lol."
Blessing for me. Need to see that Paul Reed - Tony Bradley - Dwight Howard monster lineup.
Lmao and they called that soft ass shit where jokic flopped after Dwight Howard got his arm tangled
"Haha, this probably goes to show how much Sixers I've seen so far this season: just realizing 2020 NBA Champions Dwight Howard and Danny Green are on the same team."
Dwight Howard is 35 and still does the stupidest shit
"Post-Yao/McGrady Daryl Morey Rockets up until they signed Dwight Howard.  Currently, the OKC Thunder? But they're rebuilding and not very good."
"Danny Green, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias. Mike Scott, who has a left knee contusion, was upgraded and will dress but is not likely to see playing time, Sixers coach Doc Rivers said.  Sizers beat writer on The Athletic"
Dwight Howard Point God
"*2 seconds later*  ""A SEN-sational steal by Dwight Howard at mid court"""
"Last season: We need you to go to a 3 month bubble in Florida where you're not allowed to bring any family members or guests. You will be Covid tested every day and play in empty gyms.  This season: Fuck it, play Dwight Howard at shooting guard we don't care"
Dwight Howard Quadruple double confirmed
"Dwight Howard gets to live his dream, all it took was a pandemic, and an asinine response to the pandemic.  Just postpone the game."
Dwight Howard. Now Dwight Howard is great 3 times DPOY is a great achievement but i thought he would end up being a top 5 or top 3 centre of all time.
Dwight Howard?
Furkan Korkmaz Shoots a 3   Marv - *Dwight Howard with a SPECTACULAR JAM!*
"as a rockets fan, i would tell hawks fans that if collins has the attitude and skillset of dwight ""i need to post up all the time even though i'm horrible at it and it destroys the offense"" howard, they would be best advised to move on now.  a guy whose ego exceeds his ability is trouble."
dwight howard is a snake.
"Ok so I‚Äôve watched Shaq my whole life.  Orlando Shaq was a athletic freak. Think of him as Dwight Howard. He could destroy a team on both ends of the ball easily. However he was young with a significant weakness against high IQ teams. Think Bulls, Sonics, Jazz, Lakers. Any team that could hold up a good game plan against him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong he still did his thing but he would sometimes be a liability in the half court game. His individual defense was good but in pick and rolls or swing offenses he struggled with rotating. All in all a great young player.  Fast forward to Shaq in LA. His body has matured and he went from an athletic freak to a down right beast. The size of him was crazy. Guys would look big until they stood next to Shaq. And when he played hard most team threes their hands up conceding to his greatness. A man amongst boys. No one literally no one could stop him. The best you could do was run the floor and hope to get him tired, foul him to get him to the line, or hope your own big would make him work on defense more than a little bit.  I saw you said the player they chose to best guard him was Embiid. The best Embiid could do is make Shaq play on defense. He would in no way slow him down. Embiid is like 270. Shaq was 325 muscle and a weird tone fat. He was like a giant defensive end. I saw Shaq have his way with guys who had much better defense like Ben Wallace, Young Tyson Chandler, Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, Yao Ming, and many more. Again the best most did was make him work on defense. Embiid has good defense in today‚Äôs standards. Back then I don‚Äôt think he makes a defensive team. He‚Äôs only been 2nd team all defense.   But there was a downfall to this Shaq also. The motivation to even still get better. Shaq didn‚Äôt like practicing, didn‚Äôt diet well, didn‚Äôt like working out, and often times slacked on transition and running playing. He‚Äôd sort of move a little bit on offense then ask for the ball since he knew no one could stop him. This is how he and Kobe fell out. He also slacked on defense all year until playoff time. Being the best player on the team he did a horrible job leading them. Kobe was always the leader even though fans saw Shaq as the leader because he was more dominant.  If Shaq had the mind set of a Kobe, Lebron, MJ, Magic, Bird, Hakeem, Duncan, or any other great I think he‚Äôd past Kareem. He surely would‚Äôve won about 5-10 rings with Kobe. I mean they 3-peated and he was giving at most %75 all around effort. They only lost after the 3 peat because Shaq didn‚Äôt want to work hard like Kobe and LA saw they needed to get rid of him because of it.  Those who saw Shaq know how great of a what if story he had. Even he knows and has said it. This is why many die hard NBA fans give so much respect to great players who even still try to get better. It‚Äôs hard to maintain the motivation at the top."
"you said he lost to an injured curry.  that was 2016.  that was 5 years after his DPOY in 2011.  what else could that have been a reference to?  5 years is a long time in the nba.  dwight was down to a 14/12 guy by then.  nice in the best of circumstances but when he wants all the post-ups in the world because he thinks it's still 2009, not much help.  there's a reason he spent the next 3 or 4 seasons bouncing around the league being completely irrelevant until he decided to sign a minimum contract to ring chase with LA.  dwight howard on a min contract not expecting to be part of the offense is nice.  dwight making the max and wanting touches, not so much."
"I think what pops out to me is the functional athleticism aspect.  Some athletic freaks move really stiff , like Dwight Howard in his younger days, or Andrew wiggins to an extent.  Idk what it is , probably coordination or something like that"

Dwight Howard new Secretary of Transportation.
Point Center god Dwight Howard
"I genuinely believe he‚Äôs right handed and I just have no idea why he insists on shooting with his left hand. He clearly favors his right on layups, and his shot has always just looked awkward to me, almost like it‚Äôs not natural or comfortable to him. Fuckin Dwight Howard is practically more of a threat than Ben from 3 now which is just sad"
"Draymond is a more willing shooter than Ben Simmons, but also a less willing shooter than Dwight Howard"
That‚Äôs NBA CHAMPION Dwight Howard to you!
Why is Luka a worse 3 point shooter than Dwight Howard now
This is really shocking. I would have thought Dwight Howard or Yao Ming would have done this by now
Dwight Howard in 2013
"This happens all the time, just players usually don't average a triple double before.   It's the same as Dwight Howard and more- this is what happens when somebody's game is based purely on athletics and not finesse/technique.   Everybody knew when his explosiveness was gone he would have almost nothing. His shooting has always been horrendous.   The only reason why guys like Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose are still around is because they worked on their shooting and developed their overall game. Westbrook hasn't done that and will probably be out of the league within a couple years"
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
"If you mean Nets fans, I dont think we have been in this position before - except on the other end when we bought up Deron Williams and Dwight Howard just last season.  As a Cavs fan you guys didn't benefit from it when LeBron was on the team?"
I'm convinced that Dwight Howard can guard any of PF/C
I'm expecting a Dwight Howard 3 as well
"That‚Äôs tough, I‚Äôm really hoping for the sake of fans that these front offices stop discounting these veteran players that they think are burnt out. How many more vets need to have career resurgences until front offices around the league start catching on? I think it‚Äôs absurd how many people questioned Steph this past year, obviously Lebron is doing incredible things for his age, Dwight Howard in LA this past season being a main piece on a championship team at 35, and now John Wall being another good example. Players will let you know when they‚Äôre done, a great way to piss them off is to assume they‚Äôre done before they‚Äôre good and ready."
Dwight Howard last season would like a word with you
No one has missed more dunks ever than Dwight Howard this year. He'd be less than 50% on them.
Giannis going down that Dwight Howard path he‚Äôs a top 5-7 talent but not as fundamentally skilled as the rest.
"it started when Dwight Howard became the best 7' center in the league 10 years ago. anyone taller them got extra inches. since he's actually 6'9 that meant a lot of ""7'2"" people. im sure over a few years of official heights it will change"

"He's Chris Bosh crossed with Dwight Howard at 7'1""."
Not that i disagree about that era not being discounted... but you can't count Amare and Howard in the **early** 2000s. Dwight was drafted in 2004. Prime Yao didn't get there until 2005. Jermaine O'neal is more early 2000s than them.
"So what LeBron you have 4 rings that just mean we're equals. Only champions with more rings than me can call me out  Shut up Tim Duncan I beat you in the playoffs, only champions with more rings than me that I haven't beaten in the playoffs can call me out.   Shut up Robert Horry you weren't the star for those championships, **I GAVE YOU THREE OF THEM** You're like a Dwight Howard multiplied by uh 7. Only stars with more championships than me that I haven't beaten in the pla -- SHUT UP BILL RUSSELL no one listen to Bill he's old and his memory is going  Only champion stars who ^wait ^what ^were ^my ^conditions ^again ^^ah ^^forget ^^it I AM DA MOS DOMINANT EVA CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT MY OPINION AS FACT"
"I went back and watched a few times.   I feel like Jaylen was kind of not expecting the hit and that‚Äôs what sent him flying.   I don‚Äôt agree 100% flop, and I won‚Äôt say 100% not a flop.   I mean it‚Äôs Dwight Howard. He‚Äôs huge. And Jaylen wasn‚Äôt even preparing to box out, just ball watching.    I could see it be either, though I‚Äôd call that more embellishment that a flop. There was obviously contact though."
" half the comments on here are ""fuck dirty dwight howard"". I was addressing those comments. are you going to complain about all your celtics buddies turning the injury into chirping about a player being dirty when he wasn't?"
"I mean, did he not get hip checked by Dwight Howard? I don‚Äôt think it was necessarily malicious without seeing it again but saying that Jaylen dove? The fuck?"
Fuck Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard is a fucking pussy
Dwight Howard right now is better than he was on the Magic
Fuck Dwight Howard  And shoutout to the ref yelling at him to get up
Dwight Howard shoved Jaylen into him but thanks for the insight dickhead
FUCK DWIGHT HOWARD
"See shaqs pettiness in regard to Dwight Howard, David Robinson and Javale McGee. He went out of his way to humiliate them more than once. Masking it as motivation is just a bullshit PR stunt."
AD starting to become like Dwight Howard.
"hope springs eternal.  FWIW I do think it makes sense that KCP can &amp; will stay hot this year, just probably not this hot.  In year 2 with LeBron &amp; AD he's going to have a better feel of how &amp; where his best looks will come and he can focus on just leaning into that instead of having to freelance a lot.  Also, given the other roster tweaks around him this year I think those can help, too.  Losing Rondo, McGee and Dwight Howard helps the Lakers spacing by itself.  Replacing those guys with Schroder, Harrell and Gasol really amplifies this.  Schroder is a significantly more potent offensive threat than Rondo and has to be guarded all the way to the arc, Harrell requires more attention from opposing defenses even if he doesn't provide tons of spacing on his own (he can hit a 15 footer and operate in the mid-range on face-ups which is more than you can say about McGee/Howard) and Gasol is a great passer who still provides a healthier impact on a team's offense than Howard/McGee even if he's running on fumes at this point.     All that means that lanes are open and less defensive attention is going to KCP, so he's feasting on the easy opportunities he's getting so far.  Projecting KCP to crack 40% on 3s for the first time in his career is totally reasonable, I just doubt he's going to blow away the NBA's single season accuracy mark."
"Shaq, kobe and jordan were all motivated by haters. Shaq literally thinks he is motivating guys by being a hater. And people like shaq, kobe and jordan have no respect for people who need coddling and compliments. People who do better with positivity like Dwight howard. They see them as weak and unable to do anything in crunch time.   Phil Jackson literally did nothign to stop the Shaq and Kobe beef when they were on their run because he knew their negativity motivated them. They were the type to never back down from a challenge."
"&gt;Dwight Howard, Javale Mcgee, and Rudy Gobert  All big men who Shaq, as a big man, has this mentality to *dominate* them still.   ""in 1999 Stephen A Smith said to Shaq ""You haven't stepped up yet"" and that motivated to Shaq to play harder. "" &gt;Shaq literally told Mitchell he was trying to motivate him to his face on Inside.  It's different when it's lil guys lol   He likes Giannis and give him the superman title for how aggressive he is so idk he just sounds like Shaq being Shaq to me.."
"I've gotten the impression that Shaq thinks young guys need to be bullied in order to toughen them up. That was part of the origin of his beef with Dwight Howard, I think. But yeah he's a dick whether this is his motive or not."
You mean the good ole Dwight Howard stat line
"Contending teams get guys like Dwight Howard for the min, but everyone else has trouble signing quality cheap centers."
"doubt it, he was that way in his playing career too. Remember how much he hated dwight howard? and what for??"
not attributes lol you‚Äôll be thinking dwight howard and giannis are shooters
Something like the Dwight Howard Magic?
"As great as Shaq is, he always hating especially against centers. I think he talks down on them  because he know that some of the centers in the league are better than him(skull wise). Especially with Dwight Howard, he's been hating on that man since he was in Orlando. I remember he said that Andrew Bynum and Robin lopez was better than Dwight because they play like ""true big man"" and Dwight plays like a  ""European style big men""."
"Tbh i get that because when I use to play I had teammates who needed that motivation, but the problem comes when not everyone is wired that way. That‚Äôs what happened with Dwight Howard. Now idk bout Donavan so I won‚Äôt speak on that"
"Right? These guys must have forgotten SVG took a Dwight Howard team to the finals surrounding him w 4 tall versatile shooters and a scoring PG. He knows modern basketball, the roster just doesn‚Äôt have the pieces."
I used to love shaq cause he was such an amazing player and he is funny  But he has been acting like only his generation was right all others are wrong  Doesn‚Äôt even give credit where it‚Äôs due  Starts beef with young players like Dwight Howard and Rudy gobert  Both Dwight and Rudy has been way more mature in this situation than shaq ever was
"Shaq also lied about David Robinson snubbing him for an autograph for years. I just don't trust that he has many of these players best interests at heart at all. Maybe some of the big ones, but his comments about Dwight Howard, Javale Mcgee, and Rudy Gobert to name a few show he's just doing it because he's a dick"
Shaq just reeks of insecurity. To this very day he still attacks guys like Dwight Howard and he's been retired for 10 years.
Dwight Howard ? Kwame brown ? Nic Batum ? There are players after they got paid just totally bailed or just quit to improve the new era
I would agree if Shaq wasn‚Äôt such an asshole to Dwight Howard for no reason.
I was agreeing until you mentioned Dwight Howard
Every game I miss the interior presence of Dwight Howard. Why did we pick Quinn Cook over that man
"Tbf most of his teams have had good rebounders.  Dwight Howard (career 12.3 rpg), Capela (career 9.7 rpg) and even Westbrook (7.1 rpg) are all people who grab lots of boards. Harden is a pretty good rebounder for a SG so I think his rebounding numbers in this team with DJ as the best rebounder will go up a little bit.  I doubt he gets to double digits though."
"Dwight ""almost Nick Van Exel"" Howard"
Steph's always been an underrated rebounder    I'll never forget him boxing out Dwight Howard
"Pre 80s and a lot of average players from the 80s on would be setting records that can't be beat, with the exception of Wilt Chamberlin. Put Capela, Dwight, LeBron, etc in that time period and my god. To be fair to those guys they created the foundation which was built upon and they didn't have an intense culture of greatness and all that good stuff, didn't have the nutrition and workout programs, etc.  Basically its really biased because Dwight Howard probably would have never been Dwight Howard if he was born in those times and would have a different muscle mass, view and playstyle of the game, and nutrition program. All that said I would love to have watched prime Howard (with knowledge of modern NBA) go back in time and see what would be."
"Dwight Howard: ""You can say no?"""
"I don't think free throw struggles come down to practice. Dwight Howard is famously known for shooting 82% in practice. Giannis puts in a ton of work into his free throws from reports, but nothing"
"But Josh Smith and Dwight Howard were known as bad shooters. That was not an aberration, I‚Äôm sure getting them to the line was a part of the Warriors‚Äô strategy. And was Curry over performing or was he starting to come into his own as a superstar?"
"So Harden would‚Äôve won a ring if Josh Smith and Dwight Howard were better at basketball? You realize Dwight and Josh Smith bricking free throws wasn‚Äôt exactly out of the ordinary for them, right?  ‚ÄúIf these players who are known for missing shots just didn‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôd be different!‚Äù And if Frank Ntilikina were Kobe the Knicks would be a playoff team."
"I agree with most of what you've said in this comment thread to the other dude, but  &gt; The only thing separating James Harden from finals appearances was the conference he played in  ...is absolute bs.   Harden very likely has a ring if Josh Smith and Dwight Howard don't shoot 26/63 on free throws in the 2015 WCF. It took Steph elevating his season 23ppg to 31ppg in the 2015 WCF to knock out Dwight and Harden. That was a *very* good Rockets team that won 56 games in 2015."
Walt Clyde Fraizer was born in Georgia...and you got Dwight Howard as all time best player from there. That's just disrespectful.
"Blows my mind the best Georgia has done is Dwight Howard.  It seems weird to have MJ for New York and Shaq for NJ, especially since MJ left when he was 5 and neither played high school ball in those states."
Ewing was usually the 4th best Center in the league during his career. I think he would be pretty good today. Only issue he would have today would be adjusting to foul calls. He had a little Dwight Howard in him where he‚Äôd take dumb fouls with an errant elbow.
The back is def not upper body if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm shocked Dwight Howard is still upright. Something happened to him in summer 2019 and I want in.
Dwight Howard punching the air right now
"&gt;have Steph‚Äôs career and accomplishments   there it is, the slip.   I'm not talking about Harden's or Steph's career, I'm saying your logic of ""Curry won 73 games so he must be better"" is stupid. If you could come up with something tangible about how Curry is better than Harden in terms of actual skill, instead of **team** success, I'd listen. But you blabbering about playoffs games just makes you look like a dolt.  &gt;3 separate all-NBA teammates.  The only player to make an All-NBA team **while on the Rockets** was Dwight Howard, in 2013. Like I said, all players were past their primes or injury prone. Once again, repeating tired old take is a sign that you know your argument is weak.   &gt;Harden has failed over and over in the games that matter most and you can‚Äôt even debate that  So has Lebron, and Curry, and Kobe, and MJ. Every player has duds in the playoffs. This goes back to my point of you being just an ignorant hater, and not actually understanding basketball at all. Also the fact that you completely glossed over me talking about Curry's shortcomings, I guess individual games don't matter when you're talking about him. Double standards.   I also love how running into a 70 win team and losing to a  team with 4 all stars is a ""failure"" or ""short comings, but when Lebron does it, he gets excuses. Harden also lasted against the Warriors longer than Lebron.   &gt;24.3 points on 40% shooting in game sevens, and 23.8 on 41.6% shooting in 19 elimination games.  Curry in elimination games 27.5 ppg, 42.4 fg% and 36.9 3p%, wow big difference there, also keeping in mind that Curry has three other all stars to defer to, while Harden is usually the lone star in his elimination games.   3.7 point difference in scoring and and a whooping 0.8 difference in FG%, is that the margin for what you're talking about here:  &gt;difference between him and all-time greatness  Is that all it takes? If Harden shot 0.9% better you'd consider him over Curry?  -------------------------------------------------   Once again, you're proving how you have no idea what you're talking about, just talking with a foot in your mouth. But its ok, there's people like you who get all their information from others, without vetting it or understanding context, and there's people like me, who actually understand the game and can think critically.   &gt;you want to suck James Harden‚Äôs dick nothing changes that.  Case closed."
"Dudes shooting guard that's a statistically worse free throw shooter than Dwight Howard, he's a certified bust"
The Dwight Howard trade to LA. Nikola Vucevic was just filler in a 4 team trade but probably ended up being the best player over that span
&gt;Big 4 Nets  They literally had a top 5 all time power forward. Age killed them not a lack of physical bigs they had kevin Garnett for God sake.  &gt;2013 Lakers   All there players had injuries at one point in the season. And dwight howard and pau Gasol were on that team. I dont think a lack of big men was there problem. Espiecially since dwight had just won multiple DPOYs in a row at that point.  &gt;04 Lakers - people are going to mention Dwight but the issue was Dwight lost his way on defense making him just an offensively talented big   Dwight was on the 2013 lakers not the 04 lakers. They had shaq and karl malone. That's two of the most dominant and physically intimidating front court players of all time.    &gt;97 Rockets  They had Hakeem and Charles Barkley. That's two mvps in the front court one of whom is top 10 all time.    They're has never being a super team like the current nets. And non of the super teams you mentioned failed because of a lack of physicality and big men.
It‚Äôs crazy cause you look at someone like Dwight Howard who has had back surgeries and other injuries but is still a great athlete at 35 years old
God forbid these Nets lose tomorrow to CLE. Hot takes will be uncontrollable and the Kyrie haters will be out in full force for their trade demands for a Dwight Howard JaVale McGee 3 team package.
was Dwight Howard not a superstar?
"Him not suiting up to play has no basis on his value.   In 2012, the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum in a four-team deal that also sent Dwight Howard from the Magic to the Lakers and Andre Iguodala from the 76ers to the Denver Nuggets. Bynum never played a game for the 76ers.   Bynum signed with the Cavaliers in the 2013 off season and by January Cleveland traded Bynum to the Bulls in a package that got them Luol Deng.   So what did you learn? Teams will always be eager to make stupid trades."
Dwight Howard trade should be in here if for no other reason that it was a 4-way trade that every team lost
I think this game kind of show the Lakers miss Dwight Howard and Javale Mcgee shot blocking.
Dwight Howard has entered the chat
"The rule is, you can't direct it at another player. Mutombo's finger wag started getting techs. So the only way you can do that, is to do it towards the fans. You'll see Dwight Howard block and do the finger wag to the crowd. Its why the stirring and LeBrons knee things don't get tech.  If he did the French kiss towards the crowd, nothing happens, no tech."
He should get with Dwight Howard in the off season and get some help with his 3s
He played with future HOF Dwight Howard as well!!
Now I know why he wanted Dwight Howard back in 2013
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
"I remember a game last year vs them where he had like 15 ft in the 1st half and he was still bitching, he even tore his jersey up  Later in the game he literally started jumpin on top of Dwight Howard and getting fouls called on him, puttin him &amp; Javale out of the game by the 3rd quarter. We had to play Dudley at Center because Luka was jumpin on our players' backs  He's no better than Trae"
Would have been a continuation of the Dwight Howard redemption tour. Howard and Harden teaming up again in the playoffs. Maybe go up 3-1 with Doc as the coach.
and size!   I often refer to [this all star dance off video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9LmHXXWiJs) to give younger fans an idea of how much of a freak Shaq was. He towers over Dwight Howard and LeBron in the video and his coordination and agility doing dance moves is just exceptional for some of that size.
"He said since Orlando Dwight, so Howard is already included"
"I think the 76ers would have been better going by O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs report  James Harden/Shake Milton/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Seth Curry, Thybulle and Dwight Howard off the bench  I don‚Äôt see how you stop them"
"yeah, I was basically trying to say shooters and exceptions like bam, who even tho his game is athletic I think he could last to like 38 and be like an upgraded Dwight Howard."
"Ngl, his insane athleticism reminds me a bit of a young Dwight Howard. If he improves his defense, he'll be really really good"
"Kobe - many people used to despise him. Later in his career, he became a much more beloved figure. Kind of the reverse of Kyrie Irving.  Chauncey B-B-B-Billups - from general afterthought and possible bust, to Finals MVP of a team with no superstar. Dude almost won 2 rings before even being voted an All Star  Dwight Howard - from the best C in the game, to a guy who didn't take the game seriously enough, to seeking redemption as a champion for the Lakers"
"*This* is the one that pisses you off?? Not losing a 24 year old MVP coming off a title season; or the 7'3"" Jokic that would have joined a team that made the finals twice; or the 7'1"" Dwight Howard that's willing to do PnR and able to hit free throws at 62% with his left hand?"
Are we pretending that most nba players don‚Äôt juice now? What you think Kenton spending millions on his body and his yearly Miami retreats are for massages? Come on man. People don‚Äôt walk around looking like Dwight Howard naturally
Dwight Howard was the Lakers best scorer last year because of his FG% lol
They could use a Dwight Howard for sure.
Apparently Dwight Howard is a high 70% free throw shooter in practice. Does that make him a good free throw shooter if he doesn‚Äôt do it in games?
"&gt; Dwight was still legit, just a locker room concern.  Literally nobody wanted 33 yr old slow Dwight Howard, this is insane, people were straight up clowning us. What the hell.  &gt; KCP was overpaid, though.  He showed that he wasn't.   Green was.  &gt; Morris was a good addition.   I still remember all the Clipper fans going like ""You got the discount Marcus"" man..  I don't disagree with Rondo, but he still exceeded expectations with solid shooting."
They still got Dwight Howard and Demarcus Cousins for free. The mans point is legit.
"Also, nothing against people like Rondo and Dwight Howard who had to buy in, but it definitely seems like the coaching staff and elite players made it possible for those other people to succeed (and it's recursive; Rondo helped make other people better).  All of the analytics stuff is definitely valid and yeah, winning cures a lot of problems, but it's still actual people involved and the collective culture they foster to help other players get better or worse.  Anyone who has ever come into a situation where you need to learn from others and they're willing to actually teach you stuff, or vice versa, knows that the gestalt is not predictable based purely on numbers."
oh yeah dude we totally remember you guys RAVING about the rondo and dwight howard signings lmao. Honestly baffling the 180 everyone did on those guys
"Not sure why you think Dwight is near some of these other guys.  Harrell was 6th man of the year last year, literally the best non-starter in the league.  Ibaka scores more, still plays good defense, and can stretch the floor, I think he's clearly more valuable than Howard. If we could swap them I'd do that in a heartbeat.  Steven Adams is a starter who does pretty much everything you'd expect from a starting center. Not flashy, but he gets the job done.  Howard might be closer to Lopez and Thompson, who aren't all that special and play similar roles. I just think those guys might just be getting overpaid when they actually should be minimum level guys, rather than Howard underpaid."
"Yeah sorry, I still don't buy it, not that John Hollinger is gospel but here are his comments on Dwight signing with the Sixers:  ""Philadelphia lured Dwight Howard from the Lakers on a one-year minimum deal that only counts $1.6 million against their cap, even though Howard will make $2.6 million. With Howard‚Äôs BORD$ value just over $3 million, this is good business for Philly, giving them a decent option in the middle when Joel Embiid takes a load management night off. The Lakers will need to find another minimum big man to take his place.""  This means that even after having a good showing in the playoffs, his value was just slightly over the minimum, which I would guess means that he was around minimum value when he signed with the Lakers.  The difference between Rondo and Howard is that Rondo's a guard, and guard backups are just much more valuable than backup centers in today's NBA. Also, on Rondo he says:  ""Rajon Rondo‚Äôs two-year, $15 million kinda sorta shores up a position that hurt the Hawks last season, but I thought there were better options out there for Atlanta. The second year on a deal for a 34-year-old is, shall we say, suboptimal. The Hawks had several options at this price point, so lasering in on Rondo at the expense of, say, D.J. Augustin, Shabazz Napier, Elfrid Payton or Trey Burke seemed unusual. Burke, in particular, would have fit right in to the Hawks‚Äô high pick-and-roll, rinse-and-repeat scheme and he got half as much money from Dallas.""  So it's very possible that Rondo just got overpaid."
I remember being pissed that they joined. Not so much Payton but Malone was a shitty dude and I never really liked him. Plus I am a Celtics fan and thought the Lakers were overdoing it.  But my favorite Lakers team that fell apart was the howard/Nash team. That stupid SI cover and Dwight being so unlikable as a reject Shaq clone who tried way too hard to make people laugh even though he's not funny at all
Would you like links? I literally have links to people suggesting Dwight Howard as the perfect trade link. Another person said Capella is a great trade as well. Weird to assume its literally 0 when you can pop in any single Kyrie thread and see what people are saying. But yeah.. strawman.
"That's simply not true. You signed Howard at his prime. Then you get LeBron, and AD forces his way there. It's literally 3 superstar caliber players wanting to play for/forcing their way to Lakers in the last decade. That's more than teams saw in their entire existence.   It didn't work with Dwight, sure, but that's hindsight speaking. And to this day you still keep signing bunch of elite role players because it's LA and because LA bleeds purple, even when the team is shit."
"Mostly because he wanted them to bring in superstar teammates like Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook and he ran each of them out of town in succession while the Rockets gave away all their future picks and took on bad contracts. Then he demonstrates he wants out by breaking COVID protocol and not showing up, instead, is filmed partying strippers and is clearly out of shape now.   For him to say he gave it everything he had is disingenuous. Its like a spouse that runs up credit card bills, cheats, gets drunk all the time and then says ""I've done everything but this marriage just isn't going to work"", all the while flirting with someone very attractive (the Nets)."
"Because we have cases like Dwight Howard, who is well known to be a much better free throw shooter in practice than in the game."
"Team defensive rating is usually the biggest factor, just look at the recent winners of the award. The last 8 DPOY's have led their team to a top 2 defence, 12/13 have led their team to a top 3 defence.        |Season|Player|Team DRTG Rank| :--|:--|:--| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|1st| |2018-19|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2017-18|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2016-17|Draymond Green|1st| |2015-16|Kawhi Leonard|1st| |2014-15|Kawhi Leonard|2nd| |2013-14|Joakim Noah|2nd| |2012-13|Marc Gasol|2nd| |2011-12|Tyson Chandler|5th| |2010-11|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2009-10|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2008-09|Dwight Howard|1st| |2007-08|Kevin Garnett|1st|"

that‚Äôs what high school hype will do to you   Drummond was always the next Dwight Howard in high school and he‚Äôs been trying to live up to it ever since
"&gt;but how quickly we forget that the Kobe/Dwight/Nash Lakers were supposed to be a super team  And you apparently forgot that both Howard and Nash were traded to the Lakers, not signed -- and the latter was for two firsts and two seconds, one of which became Mikal Bridges.  That was one of the worst trades in Laker history.  The Howard trade only wasn't terrible for the Lakers because of Bynum's injuries and, emotions, I guess."
Dwight Howard.
It is well documented that Dwight Howard refused to run the pick and roll as much with James Harden and wanted to prove a point that he had more to his game and decided to post up more (this was at the peak of Shaq bullying him)
You‚Äôre correct and this post is dumb. When your centers are Mike Scott and Dwight Howard you‚Äôre probably going to have problems protecting the rim without fouling.
Drummund could be the new Dwight Howard if the Lakers get him on the buyout market. I doubt he'll go for it though.
"Hairstylist: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre we doin with the hairdo this time, Mr. Howard?   Dwight: ‚ÄúMake me look like a golden ram.‚Äù"
Lmao! Dwight Howard is a freak man. How did grab that?
"&gt; Harden has had Dwight Howard, CP3, and Russ. Say what you want, but Harden has had help. And truthfully I think he'd have a chip by now if he didn't have to play against Steph's teams. But that's the point, he's never gotten past Steph. So you're acting like Harden is so much better than Steph when Harden's teams have never won their matchups.   bro, you can't say dwight howard with a straight face. did you watch those seasons? not only was he injured as fuck, he refused to play the offense they wanted to run so he could post up. he didn't run PNR with harden. he refused to.   CP3, they were an all time great team. but CP3 got hurt.  WB was a weird fit, and then WB got hurt again. he missed half the playoffs. how WB started this season was a continuation of that.  You say ""Steph beat Harden"" as if he didn't also have Klay, Draymond, etc beside him. When Harden got equivalent help, Steph got KD. and Harden STILL almost beat them. in that game 7, it was Harden vs KD, Steph, Dray, and Klay. 1 allstar vs 4. you can't look at that and go ""yeah it was steph that won."" even the year KD got hurt, KD played every game except 1 and averaged 35 (as did Harden). Without KD, they don't win that.   it isn't about saying nice things about the other player lol. we're comparing 2 direct facets of their game. if you wanna talk about something that favors steph objectively, i'll agree. steph is a better teammate, better off ball threat and better 3pt shooter than Harden. don't need to say anything ""nice"" about harden there. just talking facts."
"Steph doesn't stuff the stat sheet like Harden does, no doubt. No debate on that, if you're playing fantasy bball, go Harden.  Harden has had Dwight Howard, CP3, and Russ. Say what you want, but Harden has had help. And truthfully I think he'd have a chip by now if he didn't have to play against Steph's teams. But that's the point, he's never gotten past Steph. So you're acting like Harden is so much better than Steph when Harden's teams have never won their matchups.   I've awknowleged Harden's greatness multiple times, you haven't said a single nice thing about Curry. I just think you're a hater bruh"
"He has like a 6'10 wingspan. Plus generally a big frame and weighed like 230 in his prime, while still being very muscular. So he will never look small out there on the court. Kinda like Dwight Howard. Really only 6'9.5, but has freakishly long arms, big frame and absurd athleticism in his prime."
"The Hornets already tried the Drummond experiment in Dwight Howard.  That being said, LaMelo Ball throwing lobs to Drummond might actually make him a star... Lol."
Was Dwight Howard not a perennial all nba player in Orlando? His mindset in ATL and LA needed changing for sure but not Orlando.
"Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed.  Reed who was called up from the G league for that game.  But there‚Äôs probably no possibility you are going to have a rational conversation about Embiid or the Sixers so there‚Äôs no point in further discussion"
"There's a couple things here.  The first is that he isn't like old Dwight Howard where he demands the ball more and asks for a coach who recognizes his weakness to get fired.   He knows he's not great offensively and essentially feasts on scraps at that end of the floor (offensive rebounds and guys dumping the ball into his hands when the defense breaks down).   As to getting rebounds; he does that. More than anybody in the league over the last nine years. Since his rookie season, nobody has grabbed more rebounds than him in that time when you combine those nine seasons.   His screen setting could be better, but it's his offensive ineptitude that makes it harder. If he steps out to set a screen, his defender can stay back or step out to get ahead of the switch. There's no need to worry about him.  As to catching lobs, that has been an issue in part because he'd never played with a great point guard. Had he been a rookie with a guy like Chris Paul or LeBron, he'd be more adept at that sort of thing, but he played in a system that relied on a heavy dose of post play from Greg Monroe early (which didn't work for Monroe because Drummond's defender was always close at hand for a double team) or with Jennings and Smith, neither of whom were very interested in passing the ball.   &amp;#x200B;  People point out Drummond's offensive ineptitude, but it's like beating a dead horse.  He knows his limits, he doesn't force it, and he grabs almost as many offensive rebounds as he has missed FGs, so, statistically, his offensive game is actually pretty productive.   The issue is that his defender can lean off him and double his teammates easier, which makes things harder for his teammates on offence."
"Yes and no. He has the same mind set as dwight howard, in that they both think they're elite on offense. If he can strictly play in the rim roller role and set good screens and rebound and defend. He would be very valuable."
haha I mean yeah the guy sucks if he wants to be a focal point of an offense. But he'll have a Dwight Howard-esque late career if he wants to keep collecting checks.
"Allen is the player everyone wishes Drummond would be. A guy who knows his role, plays D, rebounds, catches lobs etc. Unfortunately Drummond has Dwight Howard Syndrome"
58 of Thybulle‚Äôs 78 shots are jumpers and 49 of those are from 3. This is the equivalent of me posting a Dwight Howard three to prove that he‚Äôs a stretch 5
I don‚Äôt even have to leave our own team to find one: Dwight Howard.   Matisse has a positive NETRTG since you seem to care about advanced stats.
"That's what I was thinking, like Dwight Howard WAS what Drummond wants to be."
Lmfao dwight howard wasn‚Äôt even good. He was good for 1 year.  And Chris Paul? Didnt we win 65 games and go up 3-2 in the conference finals till he was injured? Lol.  Russ wasn‚Äôt more successful for shit. Everyone knows harden is easily the better player. You guys kept the worst of the big 3 and now they‚Äôve teamed up again but without westbrooks trash ass
He is what Dwight Howard could have been had he stayed on the Magic and had free reign to get his every night for the of his career. lmao.
I thought y'all had Dwight Howard? Is he not panning out in Philly?
In b4 he pulls a Dwight Howard and refuses to roll to the rim and instead insists on posting up every single play
Drummond needs a Dwight Howard level ego check and realize he's not a star player the way he's playing.  it's dumb because he actually has the physical ability to be a great center if he actually fucking tried to be
"This was the narrative around Dwight Howard in L.A., and when he bought into his role everyone knew that was bad news for everyone not on the Lakers. If Drummond would buy into being that kind of role player, he'd be a huge asset.  Too bad we all know better."
he has Dwight Howard-itis where he wants to do so much more than what he's actually good at. the problem is he's nowhere near the unstoppable finisher Dwight was not is he even on the same planet when it comes to defense.   its not what you want. he wants to play like he's Giannis/Jokic when the team he's already on traded a first round pick to replace him with Jarrett Allen.
Ah yes the 2013 Dwight Howard dilemma
"He is IMMENSELY talented but seems completely averse to playing to his strengths. He's probably an all-star level player if he locked down and focused on his defense, and approached the offensive end like Rudy Gobert and Clint Capela do. But he doesn't.  Instead he thinks he's a post up big and occasionally a point center, which results in an endless stream of turnovers and a lot of inefficient shooting.  Defensively, he has the tools, but mixes in games with no effort where he's a complete liability. It's just a catastrophe.  He's basically a mirror image of Dwight Howard in Charlotte, if anybody watched that."
"do you guys remember why Dwight Howard kept getting passed around every year despite putting up great numbers everywhere he played?  It's for the exact same shit Drummond does- no defensive effort most of the time, infuriatingly stupid offense (both guys like to pretend they're point centers sometimes and post up way too often), endless turnovers.  In a lot of ways Drummond is actually worse than Dwight, who both Atlanta and Charlotte ended up dumping for negative value."
Yeah harden had Dwight Howard and Chris Paul with him during his failures. Definitely not two surefire hall of famers.
"If Metu did that to Dwight Howard , he would enjoy that"
"Key of the game for the Lakers, their 3 point shooting needs a lot of work. ‚ÄúNo Dwight Howard‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fix the bad 24% 3 pt"
I'm getting 2020 Dwight Howard vibes from these fouls being called on Trez.
"FT% is the one part of basketball where it's almost completely mental. Guys [like Dwight shoot 80%+ in practice](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1554442-dwight-howard-makes-82-of-free-throws-during-meaningless-moments-of-practice#:~:text=Dwight%20Howard%20Makes%2082%20Percent%20of%20Free%20Throws%20During%20Practice,-Gabe%20Zaldivar%40gabezal&amp;text=Dwight%20Howard%20is%20a%20competent,the%20charity%20stripe%20during%20practice.) but 50% in game."
Dwight Howard agrees
"If by drop the hammer, you mean Jimmy Butler was playing concussed because Dwight Howard hammered him in the head at the end of game 5, then yeah, the Lakers dropped the hammer on them."
Ahh so based on this metric Dwight Howard should be DPOY. Got it. /s
"Notice no response  Curry stans have literally no logical consistency to any of the arguments they're spewing on here.   There are people arguing Harden playing with Russell Westbrook, CP3, and Dwight Howard at different points in their career while they were all outta their primes, often injured and bad at the most important times (Dwight hurt and mediocre in 15 &amp; 16 playoffs, CP3 hurt in 18 playoffs, mediocre in 19 Playoffs, Russ hurt mediocre in 2020 playoffs).....  is somehow equivalent to Steph playing with Klay, KD, Draymond and Iggy all relatively in their primes for years. Bullshit. Then there's people claiming Steph has to play with Juan Toscano Anderson while implying Harden's worst role players were guys like Eric Gordon when in reality they were guys like this:  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html)  Notice his only season with Harden was his last season in the NBA. Harden had to play 70 games with a guy who was so bad he dropped out of the league forever afterwards.  Jesus, the lengths people go to defend Curry at all costs. You can still acknowledge Curry is better and all without lying about objective facts"
Dwight Howard was washed
those GS teams were fine but 2015 and 2016 Howard was not even close to the young Dwight. like at that point Klay was way better than Dwight. Harden carried hard
"Harden has played with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook.  He played on a lot of quality teams."
Dwight Howard dominated everybody and took his team to the finals and he never was a smart player at all
Dwight Howard? That‚Äôs who you thought of?
"Look, Shaq is an idiot for his stupid beef with Mitchell and Gobert, but he ain't insecure about the Jazz. He's just insecure in general. He's beefing with Gobert for the same reason he has beefed with guys like Dwight Howard: he feels threatened by any good centers. Someone somewhere probably said they thought Gobert could guard Shaq and he's all in his feelings about it.  What I see in those clips are a couple guys who joined Shaq on the Lakers to go ring chasing and [a guy who absolutely wanted no part of playing Shaq at all.](https://youtu.be/NHx0Pkle5_0) Those Jazz were good but never won, meanwhile Shaq and the Lakers won three straight. Whatever issue Shaq had with the Jazz, he got over that long ago. He's right though that the Jazz don't have what it takes to win, he's just mixing it in with his stupid insecurities.    Like [Greg Foster](https://i.imgur.com/clNDhBd.jpg) said at the 2001 Lakers championship parade: ""if you can't beat em, join em."" Back üòÇ"
"Those preseason expectations were based on Harden hate, Dwight Howard leaving, and people not believing in a team full of shooters with not so great defense in 2016-17.   Meanwhile, while people predicted the Thunder would win around 43-45 games, it was because they expected Russ to go off and carry the team like he did in 2015, and he did. And also they had a better offense on paper before the Ilyasova/Jerami Grant trade."
"A number of modern players. Dwight Howard,  Gobert, Harden, Mitchell, etc. Petty White is definitely known to seem jealous of modern players who make more than be did."
"Hot take but Dirk was my pick to win it in '11.  * 23 ppg, 7 rpg, 3 apg on 52/40/89 (most efficient season of his career) * 57-25 record (3rd in the West, but tied with LA for 2nd, just 4 games behind SAS)    * Dirk missed 9 games with an injury, then had a minutes restriction in the 2 games back, Dallas went 2-9 in those 11 games.    * In the games that Dirk played and started, Dallas was on pace for a 64-18 season, which would've easily been the best record in the league. * 6th place already for MVP voting (nearly tied with Durant for 5th, then behind Rose, Howard, LeBron and Kobe) * Better WS/48 than everyone ahead of him but LeBron and Dwight Howard. * Most efficient player in the entire MVP race (13 players) * Was the only player (alongside Derrick Rose) with no all star teammates from a top seeded team.    * LA had Kobe/Pau (Bynum was also a fringe all star), SAS had Duncan/Ginobili (Parker wasn't an all star but easily could've been), OKC had Durant and WB, Boston had KG, Pierce and Allen, Miami had Bosh, Wade and LeBron, Atlanta had Johnson and Horford.  I'm totally fine with Rose winning, or Dwight for that matter, but I feel like Dirk's 2011 regular season is super underrated, and most folks just look at his playoff run (which was absolutely bonkers!) but his regular season from 2011 was arguably a top 5 Dirk season up there with 03, 05, 06 &amp; 07."
Dwight Howard attempted 1532 free throws in practice and made them at 82% when he was on the Lakers for example. He was 49.5% career ft at the time.  Bunch more examples here: https://180shooter.com/problems-with-free-throw-practice
"The way the docu described it was the very basic free throw mechanics that were taught to players by coaches since the early basketball days, were made with guards in mind, and feature a full range of motion starting below the hip and ending over the head. But when you get guys that are 6'10 and 7 foot and teach them that same mechanic, it's gonna have way different results because of the extended proportions of their bodies. Add in the strength of these big players like, dwight howard, shaq, wilt, deandre jordan, andre drummond, lebron james, Hakeem, etc. Etc. Etc. And those free throw mechanics that work for smaller guys are just not gonna work for them.   There's a reason these these dudes can't hit free throws at a high clip besides nerves. I mean think of Tim Duncan, ""the big fundamentals"" but he shot 63% from the line."
"They went way too experimental with small ball. PJ Tucker as Center?! At least Durant or Draymond have length to be center-esque in their play.  Like they should have known any competent team with even one big man could have made their playoff run a disaster. And they were in the Western conference with a Lakers team consisting of Lebron James, who had Austin Rivers on him at one point, Dwight Howard, who is still a relatively flexible big man, Anthony Davis, a younger dominant big man, and Kostas Atetokounmpo  on the Bench, who‚Äôs not his brother, but in a pinch has a serviceable game.  Like skill is good. But skill and height is REALLY good."
"I can only say as Heat and Jimmy Butler fan, this shows some parallels with the situation, but some counters as well.  For parallels, it is clearly a player on a team he‚Äôs with dissatisfied with. He was very clear on wanting to be traded, and went not met, he acted out to show how very much he was serious about leaving. This was much the same with Butler and the T-Wolves, that practice being evident.  However, unlike Butler, Harden was not only the franchise player, but also pretty much was the face and orchestrator of the rockets with Darryl Morrey and D‚Äôantoni. He got his Dwight Howard, his Chris Paul, and Westbrook, and while made playoff runs, he couldn‚Äôt finish.   So while I can understand the want of a trade for him, he shouldn‚Äôt be making an excuse. He should be honest about it, especially about the parts on where even though Houston gave HIM everything they could, HE couldn‚Äôt capitalize on what was given to him.  I would respect Harden a lot more if he did that, but instead its more like he‚Äôs still trying to have everyone on his side, but in trying to appease them, he‚Äôs just making it worse. Brutal honesty is how Jimmy Butler went from vilified toxic lockerroom menace, to Miami‚Äôs new superstar sun."
Agreed. They need [Dwight Howard aka D12 aka ‚Äò*let me tell you about my D*‚Äô](https://youtu.be/veFgWXGDFFk)
Yeah I looked it up.  If the cut off was top 25 there would be 3 more non-HOF (with two active).  Dwight Howard sits at #21 with 2.89 TOV/per game.  And Harden is #25 with 3.69 per game.  Mark Jackson is the non Hall of famer at #24 lol.
Dwight Howard
"November 18, 2012. Kobe and Dwight Howard balled out against the Rockets. Unfortunately, the Lakers were a clusterfuck that season, but I bleed purple and gold until I die"
Bol's a nice kid but I'm glad he didn't.  Bol's made of glass and can't put on weight.  Go against Charlotte's bigs... he'd be okay.   But he's gunna have to play AD and Dwight Howard regularly.  He won't last if he has to do any post stuff.
"I would say dwight howard, but i didnt watch as much of him in his prime so i could be wrong."
"I think it would be interesting to look at average difference in win shares between the 1st and 2nd pick in the draft. You‚Äôve got your Shaq and Alonzo Mourning cases: transcendent player and all star quality but far away in comparison:  Your Duncan/Van Horn in a transcendent player and a quality starter but the gap is bigger  Then the Lebron/Darko case: transcendent player and bust.  Like since 1990, the best number 2 picks have been KD, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and Alonzo Mourning.   An MVP all timer, two all time point guards who couldn‚Äôt quite be the best player on a championship team and an all star who was never really the best at his position.  Contrast that with the 1st picks with Shaq, Chris Webber, AI, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, and that‚Äôs just the 1st team MVP types.  Then you‚Äôve got Kyrie, Ben Simmons, KAT, Larry Johnson, Yao, Blake Griffin, John wall, multiple time all stars who have been the best player on a playoff team (or in the case of Simmons and KAT will obviously get there)   That‚Äôs 15 guys in 30 years who can be the best player on a 50 win team. That‚Äôs good odds"
Oh yeah I‚Äôve been pissed about it since Dwight Howard did it.
"Uh. signed Dwight Howard, traded for Beverley for basically nothing, drafted Trez and Capela, traded for CP3, got Eric Gordon"

"Prime Dwight howard would steal Andre drummonds lunch and eat it in front of him, they aren‚Äôt even in the same stratosphere   Before the back injuries he was hands down the best center in the league. there were holes in his game, but they didnt matter pre injury. He didn‚Äôt have fancy post moves, but he didn‚Äôt need them. He was bigger faster and stronger than everyone.   He led the league in blocks and rebound like 5 straight years. And these weren‚Äôt empty 20 rebounds games like Drummond where 5-6 of them were his own misses and the team lost; he would dominate the paint on both ends for a team that was a legit title contender.  Additionally he was great with the ball in his hands- the whole offense operated out of the high post. They surrounded him with shooters so you had to choose between leaving him 1v1 and leaving shooters wide open. Half the league is still copying that formula in some form"
Not Dwight Howard anymore
"Agreed. In a lot of ways that Magic team was a precursor to the NBA we see now. Point forward Hedo  T√ºrkoƒülu, 3 and D guys like Micka√´l Pi√©trus  and Rashard Lewis, knockdown shooter in JJ (underutilized at the time), good perimeter defense with a ""scrap-heap"" type guy Skip 2 My Lou, and, uh, well... Dwight Howard.  Edit: NBA Champion Dwight Howard"
Just checked and it doesn't really seem like it. There's only been one DPOY since 2007-08 that wasn't able to lead their team to a top 3 defence and that was Tyson Chandler who took a Knicks defence that was 22nd the year prior and brought it to 5th.       |Season|Player|DRTG Rank| :--|:--|:--| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|1st| |2018-19|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2017-18|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2016-17|Draymond Green|1st| |2015-16|Kawhi Leonard|1st| |2014-15|Kawhi Leonard|2nd| |2013-14|Joakim Noah|2nd| |2012-13|Marc Gasol|2nd| |2011-12|Tyson Chandler|5th| |2010-11|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2009-10|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2008-09|Dwight Howard|1st| |2007-08|Kevin Garnett|1st|
"Dwight Howard. The only argument for Carmelo Anthony is ""muh 25 PPG!!!"" Howard was better at his peak, led more successful teams, and racked up better accolades."
"It‚Äôs the other way around, Dwight Howard was more deserving in 2011"
Dwight Howard can do that already
"&gt;2011 he had an argument over Rose, but Howard was better than both IMO  revisionist history with Dwight. He deserved DPOY but he wasn't anything spectacular offensively, a career high 22 a game. And the magic regressed hella from 59 wins in '10 to 52 wins in '11. you're not going to win MVP being substantially worse than the season prior."
Who gives Dwight Howard treatment to Stephen fucking Curry?
You forgot about the combo of Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley forcing him to foul out
"Their backup centre went from Dwight Howard to Montrezl Harrell. This isn‚Äôt that surprising, and it also doesn‚Äôt really matter because AD will be back at the 5 during the playoffs."
He had a rough game against us without Embiid. Fouled out against the combination of Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard.
"Thing is, drawing fouls is *hugely* influential on games.  And the refs . . . it's a fast game, and a few referees, no matter how good, can't catch everything that's going on.  A *lot* of high-usage offensive players get fouled *constantly* . . . but most of them are 'ticky-tack' fouls that, you know, the refs *might* call.  Once in a while.  But not consistently.  The league trains players to work the system, because the system shapes games.  Dwight Howard got trained to grab jerseys on defense, under the basket, as soon as he became a 'star' and refs stopped calling it.  I blame that on the league.  A lot of floppers flop because, *yes*, they have to sell the fouls to get a fair number of calls.  (Daniel Theis is just out of luck, LOL.)  If you get fouled, *really* fouled, and it doesn't get a whistle, you're being trained to sell the foul.  And if fouls still aren't called consistently, you're being trained to flop or whine every time there *could* have been a foul.  If you get properly fouled ten times a game, you're gonna feel like you oughtta get ten whistles.  If not on the plays where you actually got fouled, *fine*, then whenever you can get the ref to blow the damn whistle.  I think in 3-5 years there'll be expert systems watching the games and flagging fouls, and refs will check with them sometimes to see the right replay or see what the software thinks.  And it'll be weird, but it'll actually be fairer.   For now, you gotta expect the flopping and complaining.  If a player flops *ineptly*, or every damn time down the floor, that's bad.  If they complain so much they miss the next play, that's bad.  Otherwise, screw it.  It's just part of the game, unfortunately."
This shows that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Only players that I can see being better are KG and Dwight Howard and possibly Kawhi but I would put Draymond above them bc his perimeter defense and help D was better even though they were more physically able and could guard 1 on 1 better. That‚Äôs why I said possibly not absolute. Ofc there‚Äôs better all time like Ben Wallace and Alonzo Mourning but they‚Äôre not of this generation. I want to know why you think that‚Äôs such an outlandish statement. Literally it‚Äôs a very common opinion that Draymond is top three of this generation for defense. This is why you don‚Äôt understand the love for Draymond bc you don‚Äôt even understand how good his defense is.
"Remove Dwight Howard, replace with Nate Thurmond."
"Just looking at some of the oldest players still in the league that likely could be had for cheap:  Iguodala (37)  Marc Gasol (36)  Carmelo (36)  JJ Redick (36)  Ariza (35)  Dwight (35)  Lou Williams (34)  Deandre Jordan (32)  Derrick Rose (32)  Blake Griffin (31)  Boogie (30)       The question is does he realize potential primes? like for the Celtics he could bring back Kemba, but does Tacko Fall become an even larger KG? or does he even reach current Dwight Howard level? or is it based on Prime that has actually happened to this date?       Either way,  Gasol/Boogie/Derrick Rose/Blake Griffin + Time Lord would pretty much be unstoppable. And that lineup is only $49m this year (2.5+2.5+8+36m) or only $15m if you take Melo instead of Blake.  So id still have over $95m to make a roster which i could make another super team out of and even if i bench Timelord, the old fellas are still competent role players without the Time Boost"
"In my 36 years, I've never seen an athlete with this intense of a combination of personality flaws. He's self-centered to an absurd degree, but completely unaware of himself at the same time, while also constantly terrified of being disrespected due to a massive victim complex. We see a lot of guys that are self-centered (LeBron), we see guys that are not self-aware and can't handle the spotlight (Dwight Howard, at least back when people used to listen to him), and we see guys that default to playing the victim for no reason (KD), but it's very rare to see it all maxed out in one individual. Kyrie has no idea how ridiculous he sounds the vast majority of the time he talks, because it always seems like he's trying to paint this picture of some existential crisis he's going through, when in fact he's one of the most gifted and privileged humans on the entire planet. He is playing on arguably the most stacked team of all time in the sport, and all he can do still is talk about how unfair it is.   But if you tried to tell him that, he would just accuse you of trying to suppress his identity or some other bullshit he has floating around in his head."
"Rockets had a contender when they had Harden, Dwight Howard, Patrick Beverley, Josh Smith, and Jason Terry."
I swear to god he is a disgrace to the league.  Their are NBA players who have lost several members and get shit on every night..  Yet he is so self absorbed that the only thing he sees is that his team is hyper focused on..  This is just as worse as Dwight Howard having all those kids and than abandoning them.  Some NBA players can be so stupid and self absorbed.
"The You Cant Fucking Recycle That Name, Stop It All Stars  ""Melo"" Ball   ""AI"" Andre Iguodala  ""LT"" LaDanian Tomlinson  ""Bad Boys II"" 00 Pistons  ""Dream Team 2"" 96 Olympic team  ""Superman"" Dwight Howard  ""A-Rod"" Andy Roddick"
"Ah the classic comment to tell how someone clearly hasn‚Äôt watched him this year.   Idk how anyone surrounded by an injured Murray, an undersized defensively terrible guard in Morris, a 36 year old Millsap, a dumbass MPJ, Barton who‚Äôs been getting roasted by wings, and 5‚Äô11 29 year old rookie would play good defense. Jamychal green has been his only defensive help on this losing streak.   Embiid has a top 3 guard/wing defender in the league in Simmons, Dwight Howard, a much improved Tobias, Thybulle among others to help him.    He‚Äôs been playing better defense and it‚Äôs clear when you watch him, and it‚Äôs also clear his defense is not the issue. Stats back this up."
The NBA hates Dwight Howard lol
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Nash displayed more energy in that 5 second clip of him arguing with Dwight Howard on the Lakers than he has in all the 20 something games he‚Äôs been a nets coach.   My man stands on the sidelines like üòê
"Fuck, reading every reply you've done in this thread makes me roll my eyes harder and harder. Try looking at all the facts before coming up with shitty arguments.  Rockets were worse in the playoffs with westbrook than they were the previous year, yes. Of course, you forget to notice that westbrook was coming back from COVID and an injury, and was rushed back because rockets weren't doing great before westbrook even returned to the team.  Westbrook also helped them win the series, saying after the game 7 against thunder, that he recognised the play being ran as BD had run that play for him when he was back on the thunder, hundreds of times. Rockets would then go on to lose to the eventual champs. You know... like they've done the last few playoffs, losing to the West representative that makes the finals.  The thunder also had a 0.1% chance to make the playoffs as you said. But that was due to all the predictions being that thunder would tank and trade all their pieces. Realistically, a team with CP3, Gallo, Shai, Adams, Shroder, etc is really good, and should be expected to make the playoffs.  Finally, you talk about him being 'the most cancerous  player that destroyed every team he touched'. Let's go through some eras with him, and then with another player.  KD era - peaked with a finals appearance. KD eventually leaves, even with Westbrook offering to accommodate KD more. KD admits in a burner account that Billy Donovan was a big reason why. MVP Year - historical season with Oladipo credited as his number 2, who wasn't great that season. Oladipo is traded away and becomes a star the following season. Dipo credits Russ for his improvement. PG/Melo - have an amazing season together, until Andre Roberson (having a DPOY season) gets a practically career ending injury. Dre was important for helping hide Melo's horrible defense. Adams can't do it by himself, making the team worse after this injury. PG year - Russ takes a back-seat and PG becomes third in MVP voting. Sounds toxic, right! Rockets - already spoke about this above a bit, but pre COVID, westbrook was balling. Had a slow start with a new team but found his footing and eventually had a stretch playing better than Harden.   Now... speaking of Harden, let's have a quick look.at him. Had all star talent beside him including Dwight Howard, CP3, and Russ. None lasted very long. Each time, Harden requested them, and each time, Harden requested them gone. Diminishing returns every time. The latest being swapping Russ for Wall. Rockets continually screwing over their future by losing picks, to accommodate their star.  Their star then decides to ignore a global pandemic. Ignores training camp and returns eventually, looking unfit. Looking bored. Looking like he wants to be anywhere else.  Westbrook has played his heart out every single game he's ever played. He's made the players around him better constantly. Harden let the rockets continually trade their future away for him, and doesn't even respect the team enough to show up on time.  Harden is more cancerous than Westbrook. STFU and come up with facts rather than saying ""trashbrick sucks"" repeatedly."
"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
"&gt; Hardly any at all, Simmons plays heavy minutes with Dwight Howard and Matisse Thybulle who are both awful shooters  One of these dudes has 100% 3pt in the Finals. Put respeck on his name, please."
"100%.  Dwight Howard, LeBron, a ton of people who were getting into their primes 2010-2012.  I saw that shit going on in college 2006-2010 at the bigger schools, of course pros were doing it before it was banned.  Even after they kept doing it in the offense and would stop in enough time before the season for it to flush out in case they got tested."
"The ESPN commercials with all the guys riding in the Tour Bus with JVG and Mike Breen were hilarious. Also the Dwight Howard adidas ""ghost hunter"" ad from 2012."
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"He is one of those players that are kind of frustrating because he could be so much better.   In college as a freshmen he was a 20/11 player with 65% TS. That is rare company and has the potential to be a 25 point scorer in the NBA. He supposedly has a [43.5 inch vert](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664?lang=en) with elite length. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is Chris Paul. How isn't he a 20+ scorer by now? We can't use the excuse that he hasn't had pg's that can pass. By the time Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Joel Embiid, Kevin Garnett, and Giannis were 22 years old they were all 20 ppg+ scorers already. Many of us were hoping he would turn into them and his first two years he had a trajectory that he might but then going back down to 14 ppg is a little disappointing. However, the Suns play a super slow pace with Chris Paul and have bottom 5 lowest possessions per game in the NBA when last year they were top 10 so everyone's stats is going to go down a little bit. Additionally, the Suns have a lot of mouths to feed with 7 players scoring in double digits (6 players if you don't count Dario who only played 6 games)."
"Yeah who tf does he think he is, prime Dwight Howard??"
"Yeah, this is just a premature question. We've seen Dwight in his prime. Embiid is *just* reaching his prime and the level of play we've seen so far is him still growing in the league. It'll probably be 5-8 years before we can actually give a good, well reasoned answer besides ""Howard because he's reached his prime and we've seen what his peak looks like."""
Dwight howard. Easily. This is not a legitimate debate. I swear ppl think dwight was some scrub
Not really. Dwight Howard is more likely to make a 3 in the finals than LeBron is to start in an NBA game. See how dumb that sounds?
Im going to say less then 50% Do your friends understand that Dwight Howard is one of the most athletic people in history and also taller than most players which also gives him a longer reach. All that combined made him dunk on 12. I don't think there are many players with all those attributes combined to be able to do that. Also I dont know shit so who knows maybe it is easy for most of them lol
"Not to mention Bam...  Also, Jimmy rolled his ankle in game 1 too.  Also, Jimmy played game 6 with a concussion after getting hit in the head by Dwight Howard at the end of game 5....  Miami was the best team in the bubble. They got royally fucked by injuries."
it takes a lot for a former superstar to realize his days are behind him and learn how to use his veteran saavyness and whatever he has left in the tank to make a positive contribution.  Dwight Howard  has figured it out the past few seasons.
You sound like Warriors in pre Curry were of same statures like Lakers and Celtics. They were absolute shit and were having worst stretch in their history when Curry joined. Even players like fucking Dwight Howard refused to join Warriors. The Warriors were full with washed vets and fringe NBA players barring the core. And guess what around 10 players in that team no longer in the NBA.
"I've been saying that the issue is Ainge.  His overall drafting and acquisitions have been atrocious.   I look at the teams that are contenders.  They have their superstar(s) but the also have good/great supporting cast and depth.  What I see is their players are athletic, have length,  good ball handle handlers and great-good rebounders and their players have a combination of these things. I look as our roster and dont see anyone with the above mentioned except maybe Robert Williams. Ainge got rid of Kanter and even Poirie(sp) so now we get bullied under the boards.   He wanted more versatile 5s then decided to get Thompson who is average at best.  He put on too much weight and lost his leaping ability.    We could have gotten Christian Wood for cheap!!!! Imagine getting close to 20 points from him and 10 rebounds? Also,  he can spread the floor.   I think Montrezl Harrell was a affordable contract.  He's a bad man, a Marcus Smart type with more size.  I think I'd rather have him than Thies(sp) or Thompson.  We could have gotten Dwight Howard,  Javale McGee cheap and Whiteside for nothing!! Rondo would have been better than Teague and if Ainge had the foresight,  he would have gotten D. Rose from Detroit.  How come Ainge cant find the Browns(Nets), Caruso(Lakers) and other so called no-name players who are playing lights-out????  Speaking of foresight, he drafts Grant William's and Carson Edward's but the are sitting or not being the kind of contributors we need.  We let Max Straus go he he's playing well.  What about drafting Neismith but haven't been giving him time to develop? We could have gotten Bey and we also gave Memphis Bane who has the best 3 point percentage of the rookies.   Tatum and Brown are good-great players at times but they are too young.  Kobe needed Shaq he got really good, where the y just needed to surround him with the right roll players.  I think we miss Hayward more than we think.  His years of experience plus the ability to give us 20 points at any night is a plus.  Kemba is going down hill and doesn't have the explosiveness quickness like J. Morant or Fox.  He's a defensive liability and that's bad for a team known for defense.  We miss Horford and also Crowders tough ess.  We have 2 choices.  Either chalk this year and play the young guys so they have experience and also to see who they should keep. Second,  they can make some moves like sending picks and players to get someone who can contribute more than what we have.  Would it be possible to get Rose and Knox for Kemba, Thompson or Thies and our trade exception?   What about 2-1st rounders,  Kemba and Thompson for Turner and Warren?     Steven's can do better but he's dealing with the hand Ainge gave and continues to give him.  Gros said sometime ago that he would go over the luxury tax to be competitive.....well, let's see if he's serious"
Seems like they could use Dwight howard right about now.
Dwight Howard still plays?
do you currently consider dwight howard a superstar? what about Rose?
"Marc Gasol was never prime Dwight Howard and he was one of the best defenders in the league. Jokic does have the tools to be a decent defender (some of the best hands in the league and is fucking huge), but I'm not sure the effort and drive is there (which is fair because he has a huge offensive load)."
"It‚Äôs a mix of both. He had a great start to the season, and it was a real breath of fresh air for sixers fans to not see our leads immediately evaporate when Joel sits. He provides solid rim protection, rebounding, and interior defense that we‚Äôve never really had behind Joel before.   That said, he then hit a bit of a skid. He played pretty poorly for a month and we were getting at most 15 mins a night with him. Part of that is he‚Äôs older and foul prone, and it‚Äôs hard for him to stay on the floor for long periods of time. Part of it is he‚Äôs not a great fit with the hybrid bench unit Doc seems to favor, where Ben runs with the Shake/Tisse/Howard+ one of Korkmaz or Mike Scott (both of whom have been in and out of the lineup with injuries).   There‚Äôs not enough shooting in those bench lineups, which lead to offensive stagnation and some rough games for Dwight where he was fouling too much.  He is basically the same as last year, an impact player who due to age and play style is very matchup dependent.   So really, both things are true. He‚Äôs the best backup we‚Äôve had for Embiid, and he has games and matchups where he dominates and we love to have him. At the same time, having one more option at the five spot, particularly someone who can stretch the floor for those Ben+Tisse lineups, would also be a huge benefit to our bench production."
Raps and mavs both wish they had Dwight. Last years playoffs showed me how useful he can really be. But isn‚Äôt it weird as fuck that Dwight Howard is a secondary type player now
Would Dwight Howard work on the Nuggets? Bump Jokic to PF. Losing Grant really blows.
"I know that. But YouTube videos usually did not have the same quality as the live airing.  Also, coming across YouTube videos that had a similar quality to the Dwight Howard dunk was waayyy more common than it is now. That‚Äôs mostly what my comment was about."
"If he's a shit defender then can you explain why we're a better defensive team than we were last year? Even with AD already missing more games than he did last year?   Hilarious how morons in this sub somehow think Marc Gasol is the issue for this Lakers team. It's the offense not the defense that's the problem, shooting specifically. Dwight Howard isn't going to fix that."
Except Dwight Howard /s
"Dwight Howard has all of his in frames. You can see that in his house tour.   Idk why you‚Äôd wash it though, it‚Äôs not like wearing a shirt where your sweaty armpits suffocate underneath the shoulder sleeve. It‚Äôs still a little gross though."
"""I tell you what..Dwight Howard rolling over in his grave"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
It‚Äôs hard to have any concept of how big this dude actually is. Go google Dwight Howard Kris Allen to get an idea. He‚Äôs an absolute monster.
And ironically Dwight Howard was avail this year and they didn't try to sign him.
"the team that has Dwight Howard has that, yes"
"It's really sad. Tyson said he wanted to retire here. Cuban was just unhealthily obsessed with Dwight Howard, who was never going to come."
"You should know that Walton was absolutely nothing like Dwight Howard. Honestly, I'm not sure I can think of many worse comps (edit: except that Hassan comp. Oof)   I'd say he was more like a more physical version of Pau Gasol. He moved with that same awkward fluidity/coordination and had that same super high release and great passing. Walton was an elite defender and rebounder though, and they ran the offense through him more than Pau."
"Prompted Chuck to say on live television, ""If I had a body like Dwight Howard, I'd just go around the country beating the hell outta people."""
Young Dwight Howard and young Blake Griffin will forever be two of the most exciting players ever to watch. It looked like the Zion highschool mixtapes but in the mf NBA.
Better passing prime Dwight Howard without the leaping ability. Pure hustle guy who was strong as hell. My granddad has an old reel of film from the 1977 NBA finals and made me watch it so I could ‚Äúlearn the pain of being a Philadelphia sports fan.‚Äù
"or challenge him to get in his mind ""fuck shaq. I'm going to go all out and prove him wrong."" Shaq doesn't actually want guys to not improve unless their name is Dwight Howard"
"‚ÄúHowever, Haynes reports that the Lakers reportedly never gave a formal offer to Howard, and instead, they had a ‚Äúdeal concept.‚Äù He was then forced to delete the tweet.  Then, while waiting to hear back from the Lakers to see if he had an official offer to accept, Howard accepted a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers. He will now play with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons this season.‚Äù   [if you want more info here‚Äôs a link just summarizing the whole situation ](https://www.sportscasting.com/dwight-howard-lets-everyone-know-what-happened-between-him-and-the-lakers/?amp)"
*Dwight Howard is a valuable component to any contending team!*
Al Horford is better than Dwight Howard lol
Dwight Howard still can throw down a good dunk
Great to see Dwight Howard throwing down a bunch of dunks.
"I‚Äôve been in a coma since 2011, is Dwight Howard still the most dominant big man force in the league?"
"vintage Dwight Howard tonight, would have been even better if that 3-pointer went in"
Dwight Howard and the defense won this one for the Sixers
"Please let the final score fool you. *This was definitely a close, hard-fought game where the Sixers pulled away in the final minutes.  The Mavs totally didn't get dad-dicked by Ben Simmons and a 95-year-old Dwight Howard.*"
‚ÄúLakers fans will regret not re-signing Dwight Howard‚Äù   Imagine reading that like a year and a half ago lol
"Dwight Howard carried the bench unit like crazy, absolutely sucks we did nothing with Simmons and embiid off the floor"
halfway through the 2nd quarter and the leading scorer of the game is.. Dwight Howard
I genuinely believe that 2019 Dwight Powell was better than current Dwight Howard. This is just sad :(
Is this really about to be the Dwight Howard game. This brickfest lol unreal
dwight howard babying the Mavs' centres
dwight howard is now an mvp candidate hes having the best game
Dwight Howard single handedly beating us
Cool we‚Äôre gonna just let Dwight Howard boom us?
"I mean Harden has played with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. Those are some pretty big names."
"Hakeem Olajuwon said Kobe was his best post student. Considering that Melo, Lebron, and Dwight Howard are all players who worked with Hakeem, for a shooting guard to be his best post student really speaks volumes to Kobe‚Äôs dedication to the entirety of the game."
"Giannis has been in the league since 2013. We could do the same shit with him.  Dwight Howard was garbage in the playoffs aside from the Dallas series and the portland series, go look what he did against bogut and the warriors."
Dwight Howard in 2015
"&gt; But again, if he slows down, he won't be as unstoppable  Counterpoint: game 4 against the Heat. His injury made him unable to make long runs, instead he would take the ball at or below the 3pt line and actually score better.  Or -I dunno- Kidd's Giannis who was playing closer to the basket during the playoffs and actually improved his performance (compared to the RS).  Granted , none of the two examples were ""traditional big"" stuff, but the idea that will get slowed down closer to the basket does not hold water. He is no traditional post player (though he does have some post moves) but he is no Dwight Howard either. His finishing ability is one of the best in the NBA due to his use of angles.  My point is that Giannis seems to be more comfortable closer to the basket than people give him credit for. Merely it is not there where he started so he is only slowly getting there. And yeah I do expect him to have a usable post game by the time he is in his 30s. That and the fact that his athleticism won't go as far down as people think (athletic people that protect their bodies remain athletic in their 30s. Westbrook is still way more athletic than most of the league despite his age) can well extend his career.  In fact I fully believe *that* to be the next phase of his career. Transitioning even closer to the basket with all that that entails."
"&gt; Dwight Howard shoots like 90% from the FT in practice.  Ok, so there are legit hoopers out there that shoot 90% from the line as well."
"Yeah, I mean look at this video of Howard/Simmons shooting 3's in practice:  https://fansided.com/2020/12/16/ben-simmons-dwight-howard-pregame-3-point-contest/  Can a *really* good amateur shooter beat Howard or Draymond in a 3-point contest?  Yeah, probably.  There are lots of good shooters out there - ex college players and the like who never go pro.   But the average fan sure as hell can't."
"Man the last time I saw the dunk contest was when they had dwight howard and he did the Superman dunk. I just catch the highlights on here or twitter. 99.98% of the time it isn't intentional. There's times I completely forget to watch it and there's times I remember to watch it, turn it on and the 3pt contest is on so I turn it off, then when I remember to check back again I missed everything already.   Never seen a pro bowl in my life, religiously watch every playoff game and regular season game for my team.   MLB, I'm sure I've seen the HR derby at least once although the last time I watched an actual game of that period was when Barry Bonds was chasing 756 or whatever that figure was,so if I saw a derby it was more than a decade ago. Those were good times."
Dwight Howard shoots like 90% from the FT in practice.
"ah yes the gentleman's sweep from the warriors was his only other conference finals, however his first two seasons on the rockets 1st round exit, then conference finals with dwight howard team, first round exit, second round exit, chris paul conference finals where they may have won, second round exit, second round exit, and now we are caught up to present"
"I think the lack of javele and Dwight Howard is being understated in your argument. The more that Rudy Gobert gets to guard AD the better for us and Marc gasol is currently averaging just over the same minutes as each of them individually. The lakers backup center presently is Trez who is a total defensive liability and can be matched up with bogey much easier than McGee or Howard would have been. I think losing their size hurts AD against us a lot and they are not similarly constructed to how they were last year so I really don‚Äôt think his stats from last year are valuable comparisons. This is a league of matchups and pg and kawhi are without a doubt a worse matchup, we only have one elite perimeter wing defender and them being able to play Morris at the 5 plays Rudy out of the game which harms us a lot more than what the lakers can do."
It‚Äôs crazy he is only piece still around from the Dwight Howard trade.
"To be fair i'm not saying anybody could shoot 90% if they just chose to shoot underhand, Wilt was about 60.5% underhand and about 48% overhand (presuming he shot exclusively underhand from '60-'62 as the first result of my google search suggested).  I'm not even sure any one player could shoot as well as Wilt did when he flipped the grip but I am sure that traditional form did not work for Shaq, DJ, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard and imo they shouldve at least given it a real chance in games."

Those lean post-Shaq years weren't great, but it actually looks like his last 3 seasons sunk him the most. Same story for Pierce, although for him it actually looks more like his early Celtics years sunk him."
"Shows how young this sub is that even 12 years ago is too long for people to remember how insanely good prime Dwight Howard was on defense. Dude had Jameer Nelson, Hedo and Rashard Lewis starting with him and made them a top tier defense. I'd put him at the top only because Ben Wallace played in an ugly era of basketball before teams really started spreading the floor."
Jeremy Lin and Dwight Howard
"*shrug*  No stake in that debate. I will say, didn't Harden have any help? Could have sworn he had one of the greatest PGs of all time on his team for a while. As well an all star in Dwight Howard. So it's a bit disingenuous to say Harden did it all by himself."
Dwight Howard was not the reason we back swept our opponents lol
"Those are prime Dwight Howard numbers, but better"
"Our best 3pt shooter? Nah, it was Dwight Howard. He shot 60%!"
"He wasn't the clear number 1 option that year, him and Howard where on the same level. Next season when Dwight went down and started regressing because of that injury, he wasn't the same in the playoffs and Harden took control of the team. He also lost against KD and WB in 2013, but he wasn't the superstar player we think about today."
But do you think Dwight Howard will get into the Hall of Fame?
"&gt;I 100% did not make a case for Harden with those 2019 stats.  BPM and VORP are no better than PER and WS, all of them are mediocre at best advanced metrics. I'd personally take WS/48 over VORP and BPM. LEBRON and net rtg are the best of those advanced stats imo, and they easily favor Giannis.   &gt;   &gt;Also worth noting Harden had a fantastic supporting cast in 2018-2019, better than Giannis did. Still won 7 less games.  DO YOU WATCH BASKETBALL? Harden had an injured CP3, Capela and Gordon who played not even 10 games together healthy all year, what the fuck are you talking about? Giannis had a better team by the virtue of them being fuckin healthy, and he played in the cupcake Leastern Conference.  Harden still took them to the 2nd round as a top seed despite being injured all year. He had 40 games of 40. 30 straight games of 30. Averaged about 50 for a stretch of a couple weeks without CP3, Capela and Gordon. Giannis could never, ever dream of doing anything close to that in terms of carrying a team  &gt;For 2014-2015, I think Harden's supporting cast has often been vastly underrated. He had a very deep squad, the top 3 doesn't match GS, but the 4-8 guys are better without a doubt in my mind.   Shaun Livingston, Barbosa, Iggy and Barnes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; washed Jason Terry, injured Pat Bev (who didnt even play vs the Dubs in the playoffs), Montejunas and Joey Fucking Dorsey, who was so useless he was out of the league after that season.  You are beyond the pale if you believe that, you're just making shit up if you believe Harden's depth was better than prime Warriors'. Jesus Christ.   &gt;I don't see how you can look at their seasons and conclude that Harden was more dominant. Curry's ridiculous efficiency is the reason Golden State rose to glory the way they did.  Never said Harden was more dominant. At all. Just said that Curry wasn't 'far more dominant' than anyone else that year, because he wasn't.  He was in 2016, I'll give him that  &gt;My criteria is a combination of individual stats, how much did a player make a team better, and how successful the team was in general. How many games do you think GS wins if they were led by Thompson/Draymond without having Curry? Likely not even a playoff team.  They are likely definitely a playoff team, even in the West. That's 2 All NBA players, with prime Iggy starting with Curry gone to bring more firepower. Other good depth too. That motion offense of Kerr's can raise their floor to 40 wins. Curry's more of a ceiling raiser; the perfect ceiling raiser that elevates that team to being the best  But I like this argument; where do the 15 Rockets go without Harden? If you say anything other than the worst team in the league, then I'm done. Montejunas, injured Pat Bev, washed Jason Terry, Ariza and washed &amp; injured Dwight Howard (missing 41 games) maybe win 20 games."
Or Dwight Howard
"Dwight Howard in Orlando, LA, Houston, Atlanta and Charlotte.  (If you go back and look at threads for those last 2 years, you'll see he got All Star buzz and even from the guys on Inside The NBA)"
Fuck it just have Dwight Howard put a cape on again.  People will eat that shit up
He wouldn't have deserved it over Dwight Howard in 2011 even if Rose didn't win. Do you realize Wade basically put up similar numbers to Lebron that year? Lebron wasn't even the alpha on the team. Plus the Bulls swept the reg season against the Heat. I think it was 4 games to 0. NBA is about storylines and narratives. No way Lebron was winning that award after Rose hit that ridiculous reverse lay up against Wade n Lebron chasing him down.
"....is that a bad thing? I only have beef with shaq when he does his forced BS like with Mitchell or making up whack shit like g5 clearance. Usually he seems to enjoy what he watches, but holds big men to a very high, somewhat unreasonable standard. Does everyone have to be nice and appreciative all the time? He‚Äôs literally on an entertainment show. As long as it relates to basketball critique and not stupid shit like with Mitchell.   My take is: Kareem and Russell stood on the stage and passed the torch to shaq and he legit cried. This man is not gonna pass that torch on to fckin Dwight Howard, even though he‚Äôs a beast in his own right. Is that a bad thing"
It really sounded like they were close to tears after a Dwight Howard box out tonight. Incredibly funny
"I have alot of respect for Shaq. It's clear that he was raised on Kareem, Moses Malone, Walton. Then he had to prove himself against Hakeem, Ewing, Robinson. Dude loves the mythology of the back to the basket center (partially because he was enshrined in it). Dwight Howard was a perversion of that as a Big who could run and dunk and defend but had no soft touch, footwork or competitive fire that he or his forbears had. I can forgive him somewhat for shitting so much on Dwight (and McGee for similar reasons). Embiid may be the last great back to the basket center. Dude is Hakeem with the charisma of Shaq."
Called Dwight Howard a thug
He said that Dwight Howard isn‚Äôt a bball player anymore and is just a thug.
He tweeted earlier calling Dwight Howard a thug
it appears he called Dwight Howard a thug
Dude went IN on Dwight Howard. Not wrong though
"For people asking, raps reporter said Dwight Howard was more of a thug than a bball player  Edit: reporter not annoucer"
"Depends on who you ask. For example, if you ask Skip Bayless he will tell you Luka is the worst three point shooter ever, worse than Shaq and Dwight Howard combined"
They never complain about the refs or Dwight Howard as far as I know
Dwight Howard adds very well to Philly's NFL tactics
do u think dwight howard has ever made a car door fall off by closing it too hard?
He's not gonna finish with his points or assists. But of he wasn't on the floor I doubt the Raptors would be doubling/tripling Dwight Howard so hard that they constantly leave good shooters wide open.
I don't think /u/Andrewski18 gives a fuck about Dwight or JaVale. He's complimented bigs when he was slandering Howard/JaVale.
"The whole 1 year rental point aside, did we not go for it with the Kyrie trade and the Hayward signing? That didn‚Äôt exactly work out. It‚Äôs not like you can simply trade for a top 5 player every single year and automatically win a chip. If it were that easy every team would go for it every single year.  Also what about the Clippers selling the farm and being a 2nd round exit last year? Or the Rockets going after Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and not making the finals? There are plenty of teams that make trades and it doesn‚Äôt work in the first year, or at all, and if all the Celtics were getting were likely 1 year rentals why would you do that and have to start rebuilding as Tatum is getting around to that start-of-prime-years range?  The reference of the Heat going for it with Jimmy Butler was also kind of strange, since didn‚Äôt Philadelphia do the exact same thing with him and they didn‚Äôt make the finals? It‚Äôs all just painting a picture to fit this narrative.  These media nephews need to chill on the Boston slander and leave that to fans and redditors."
NBA players mostly make wide open 3s. Even Dwight Howard would score a few.
"mavs wanna win now to keep luka happy because every superstar bad season is an implicit threat that they'll leave. porzingis isn't helping them win now. magic have 1 asset who helps the mavs win now (vucevic), and he's the franchise's only all-star since dwight howard. i doubt the magic are gonna trade their only good healthy player, a healthy big european center playing and shooting at an all-star level, for an unhealthy big european center playing and shooting at a below-average level. and i don't think the mavs could sell a porzingis for fournier/davis trade to the team or fanbase.  any other suggestions though? it seems like a lot of the ""puttering"" teams are also severely lacking the necessary assets. pistons can't even trade any firsts and they're practically hoarding unhealthy big guys."
"He was a warrior who was playing the Warriors, but let's admit it, he was not fouled on that play and the refs blew some bullshit fouls on the Warriors that gave the Lakers the game. I still remember a Dwight Howard moving screen where Steph received a foul for it."
Boogie isn't mobile enough. He'd get crushed in the Raptors system. Remember how Boucher totally torched Dwight Howard? Boogie will get regularly torched on the Raptors.   Cousins at best would be a Baynes replacement (18 minutes off the bench) ... but you'd have to hold onto Baynes anyways because Cousins is an injury risk.
"This is gonna get long but the deal would have been perfect if Oladipo was playing like his pre-injury self.  But the problem is that he isn‚Äôt.  So the Simmons deal was higher floor/ lower ceiling, while the Brooklyn deal was higher ceiling/ lower floor.  There are a few ways (most of which involve the Nets becoming bad) that the Brooklyn deal pays off:  1. The Brooklyn Nets‚Äô big three breakup and join new teams which can happen at the end of next season.  2.  Harden, KD, and Kyrie age horribly and cap out the Nets down the road  3. Brooklyn‚Äôs roster bottoms out due to injury   4. Some combination of all the above  5.  Houston uses those picks in future trades for star level players.  If any of those things happen this trade is a success, and whether or not it‚Äôs better than Simmons boils down to how high or low you are on him and who they eventually get in return alternatively.  Now it‚Äôs hard to speculate on these things.  The prevailing attitude seems to be that Harden, KD, and Kyrie will all age like fine wine, get along well and retire together in Brooklyn leaving all those picks to be in the 20s.  However even successful super teams can be short lived, and injuries can tank even the best of franchises-case in point Miami Heat with LeBron and the KD era Warriors.    But even if they get along well and even retire together, they will get older in years 2026 and 2027, Kyrie will be 34-35, Harden will be 36-37, and KD will be 37-38.  It‚Äôs difficult to say how good these players will be at those ages.  Just for perspective Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony are both 36 years old right now, while Dwight Howard and CP3 are both 35 years old.  DWade also retired at age 37 not too long ago.  So it‚Äôs very possible that by then Kyrie and Harden could be both be on bloated contracts and KD could be retired and still have no depth making for a very decent chance at at least two lottery selections there, although it‚Äôs tough to say how much carrying those guys will be capable of at that age.  So the best realistic case scenario for Houston is probably a combination of #2 and #5 where they trade most of those picks (excluding years 2026-2027) for young star caliber players (ie MPJ and or John Collins) while hitting big on their own picks and while still having 2 very valuable lottery selections in years 2026-2027  TLDR: We don‚Äôt know yet, it really depends on what happens with those picks/what Houston does with them. So time will tell"
"He did against John wall, Russ, Dwight Howard, obviously not as respected as cp3 but still pretty respected players, you can‚Äôt hold back against people just because they are good or he‚Äôll look like a punk. But I do see where your coming from."
"OK, [here's an example](https://fansided.com/2015/05/29/rockets-dwight-howard-suspended-flagrant-upgraded/) of it happening before 2016. Anybody who thinks this is some unprecedented thing for the NBA to upgrade a common foul to a flagrant after the game either is very new to watching the league or simply doesn't pay any attention."
"Dwight Howard had a dude shove a broom in his ass, he doesn‚Äôt count."
Gilbert Arenas And Dwight Howard
"they bought that shit and they couldn't even give it away ... lol Funny thing was it was the same for Dwight Howard his first time around for the Lakers with #12 and fans thought, fuck ... why did he change it I wanted to wear the old jersey"
"Wow... I wouldn't have thought Chris Paul could dunk on Ron Howard, let alone Dwight."
Ok here we go : - Patty Mills warm up dunk : https://youtu.be/fJRWKKRolJ8  - JJ Reddick : https://youtu.be/V0JnL74D8TU  - Ricky Rubio : https://youtu.be/05ace2B1GNU  And just for the pleasure : - Chris Paul on Dwight Howard : https://youtu.be/UDjzvJYWtoc  - Tony Parker : https://youtu.be/pvdR6b6hwek
Robinson wasn‚Äôt half the post player Timmy was. Man was like Prime Dwight Howard with a decent enough jumpshot which is still ridiculously good but he was more a freak athlete as opposed to a basketball savant like Timmy or Hakeem.

"Anyone who can shoot the 3-ball.   With our 3 point defense this year, I'm just waiting for Dwight Howard to double the total threes he's made in his career all in one game against us"
"Are we forgetting that Dwight Howard was a 3 time defensive player of the year and the best player on a finals team??? I know he‚Äôs fallen very far, but the disrespect of asking why Dwight is not Rudy. Lol Dwight I‚Äôm his prime was waaay better than Rudy gobert."
Devontae Cacok-Dwight Howard
" I wasn‚Äôt really trying to make much of his defensive metrics - I even mentioned that they rarely tell the full story. My point in bringing them up is that they likely hold some validity in his case considering the impact that he makes on that end, which of course is something you have to actually watch to fully appreciate. His on/off defensive numbers probably do a better job at showcasing that.   &gt; Team D definitely matters and I don't disagree that Lebron is the anchor of the team, but they also have last year's DPOY runner-up in AD, the active leader in career DRTG in Dwight Howard, and the #12 and #16 active leaders in career DRTG (Green &amp; Rondo). The nuggets have one player in the top 100 for career DRTG (Millsap at #11).   Bro, AD hasn‚Äôt played in a month and Howard, Green, and Rondo are no longer on he team."
"number 27 for the Sixers is kind of interesting  https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400828119  Harden dropped 50 because of course he did  Sixers played against Dwight Howard and Corey üÖ±Ô∏èrewer  You‚Äôll recognize several OG processors such as RoCo, Jerami Grant, and Regular Jah.   Sixers DNP - coaches decision? Some guy named ‚ÄúChristian Wood‚Äù"
"Andrew Bynum, but nevermind,  on his 2nd &amp; 3rd yr. he won two rings  (2009, 2010) with Lakers, contributing on offense as well as defending Dwight Howard  Kevin Garnett. After that  (2012 &amp; beyond) he fall on injury bug &amp; never recovered his Lakers form."
i thought Dwight Howard was number one in SEMEN considering all the children he has
Damian Lillard  Demar Derozan  Kawhi Leonard  KG  Dwight Howard
Dwight howard tried. It was...bad.
"Someone that has the athleticism and verticality to be able to catch lobs and finish dunks, at the 5 meaning as a Center (positions are numbered 1 through 5). A good example is if you look at the sixers, our main 5s/centers are Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard. Embiid‚Äôs obviously amazing, but he‚Äôs not much of a lob threat. He doesn‚Äôt get up in the air super quickly, he‚Äôs quick on his feet moving around but he‚Äôs not jumping out of the gym on a consistent basis. Dwight has a far more limited skillset, but he‚Äôs a terrific lob threat. He has a huge ‚Äúcatch radius‚Äù meaning he has a lot of range for where passers can put the ball on an alley oop, it doesn‚Äôt need to be perfectly placed.   LaMelo is an incredible passer, and plays extremely well at a fast pace and in transition, and having a center who is a true lob threat (compared to Cody Zeller and Bismarck Biyombo who are not), would benefit both players a lot."
Dwight howard
"Seriously watching Drummond is one of the worst experiences Ive ever had with the NBA. This guy just looks lost and it really seems like he just doesn't know what he's doing when he has the ball in his hands. He's playing horrible on offense and is not engaged on defense. Watching Drummond play the Lakers was the worst 25/18 I've ever seen. Before watching this game I wouldn't have believed you could put up these numbers and be the worst player on the court simultaneously lol. If he were to just focus on catching lobs, grab rebounds and offer some rim protection he could be a good roleplayer but this guy is on some Dwight Howard shit while being 10% as talented as Dwight."
"I can also provide examples of players who peak younger than that. Kevin Love, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Rajon Rondo.  You can say guys get injured but that doesn't allow you to dismiss them from the data set, that's a big part of why they fall off."
because the lakers were the number one rated defense and dwight howard did his job really fucking well that series
Prime Dwight Howard had a shoulder almost as big as his head.
Penny hardaway  Nick Anderson   Dennis Scott maybe   Dwight Howard (cheating but he was a pf his first 2 years)   Shaq
"If you‚Äôre not going to listen to my points then I probably shouldn‚Äôt spend the time to respond to you. To reiterate, Dwight Howard and Javale McGee‚Äôs entire jobs in that series were to get Jokic to foul out. They would hang on him, play really physical, etc. They would both pick up fouls in the process but it didn‚Äôt matter because there were three of them (including AD). If he matched their physicality even a little bit, they would exaggerate contact to get him the foul. Dwight Howard himself would admit this. His goal was to get Jokic out of the game. Jokic was in a lose lose situation. Thankfully, the lakers are less equipped to do that again this year because they don‚Äôt have as much size/athleticism at the center position."
"Those who watched that series know that there was little Jokic could do. The lakers‚Äô strategy was to send really physical guys at him and get him in foul trouble quickly. Dwight Howard would foul out fast, but then they‚Äôd just send Javale at him or AD. They even admitted their strategy was to play him really physical. So either he could disappear by not playing aggressive or he would foul out by even trying. Not to bring reffing in it, but the refs were perfectly happy to take Jokic out of the game early."
"Always weird to me how someone that has never met the woman would say they can't believe the man left her or cheated on her. Maybe she is a massive bitch, maybe her pussy was trash, maybe they had an open relationship. Plus I promise if most average joes had the options these young millions do, they'll go crazy. Prob have more baby mamas than Dwight Howard and Shawn Kemp."
I have the banger:  I really my team to take Emeka Okafor over Dwight Howard. Do I get a pass for being 14 years old?
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
Not as legendary as Nets legend Dwight Howard though
"for awhile i thought Dwight Howard would be on similar path, but he surprised me with his run for the Lakers and he is not so bad for the Sixers either.  Wonder if something similar could happen for COusins. Not on defense though."
And Dwight Howard is apparently the reason the 76ers are on top of the east.
"You need in game reps to get your 3pt better, I have no doubt Simmons can shoot his ass off in a gym and he has shown he has before, but that doesn‚Äôt matter in game, look at Dwight Howard warming up before any game. If anything the fact that his FT has improved shows that the potential is there, there is no reason for him to not be taking threes AT LEAST if they are blowing teams out."
Better than Durant? No  But I think a healthy Oden is probably the best center in the league in the time period between Magic Dwight Howard and the current era of Embiid and Jokic
"I don't think it's fair to expect anyone to have a career like KD has had. It's very rare.  I think Oden would have a similar career to Dwight Howard, with maybe a little more longevity. He was a physical big man who would have been nasty on a potentially scary Blazers team. But the league evolved away from his type of play and he wouldn't have had the longevity. At this point, he would probably be like an older Andre Drummond."
Dwight Howard gets to the rim
"There's a huge revisionist history on Reddit about D Wade during that Heat era.  As absurd as the comment seems to you (and me as well). The vast majority of this sub who were to young to be watching the NBA 10 years ago, honestly believe that Wade was washed up like Dwight Howard on last year's Lakers, when they won in 2012-2013.  It's all part of the LeBron fanboys narrative to make him greater than MJ. Apparently Wade was a washed up veteran when the heat won and it was all LeBron. Meanwhile 33-35 year old post-back surgery Scottie Pippen averaging 14ppg is the main reason the Bulls won in 97-98."
"I mean seriously we started a game with Isaiah Joe, Tyrese Maxey, Dakota Mathias, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard with a bench of Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and supposedly Mike Scott I‚Äôm not sure why anyone is shocked that our differential is a bit off."
Am I high or have I seen way too many Dwight Howard highlights in this sub?üòÇ
LeBron did it in his second game 18 years old. Dwight Howard did it at 18 as well. I'm guessing others have as well.
"When people compare  Embiid's defensive stats with Jokic, it seems like they forget that one of them is surrounded by defensive stalwarts such as Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, etc, and backed up by Dwight Howard, while the other has... Gary Harris. If he's healthy that is.. and is backed up by Hartenstein, or the #1 on the list JMG. When  perimeter defenders can't contain their players, the center will obviously have a hard time stopping 1 on 2s, or even 1 on 1 when dealing with quicker guards. It's not the same when you're defending the post against off balance guards due to good perimeter defense, and going 1 on 2 and having to choose between picking up a foul or not contesting a layup..."
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn‚Äôt pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‚Äò04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‚Äò05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‚Äò06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‚Äò07: Durant (#2 ‚Äî sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
"Shit bro you proved me wrong, I forgot Rudy and the Jazz made some serious noise during their back to back first round exits...  He got overextended all series during that embarrassing Rockets matchup two years ago. I‚Äôm not shitting on Rudy, but he‚Äôs not Dwight Howard. He plays in a system that maximizes his strengths and has surrounded him with the pieces to succeed. And in the postseason, he has not played close to his best basketball because teams figure shit out. ‚ÄúCarried‚Äù my ass lmao."
yeah they're gonna have to put at least peak Dwight Howard in there and maybe I'll take the Nets in 7
Dude had no interior presence against us. Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard feasted against him and Markkanen. This team badly needs an interior presence on both ends.
Dwight Howard special except its reversed
"That‚Äôs the power of doing things without complaining, something Melo finally showed at the blazers, and look at all the praise he‚Äôs now getting. It‚Äôs the same as Dwight Howard to some degree, was seen as a cancer to teams, but now is one of the most valued veterans on the lakers last year and philly now"
How‚Äôs he not? Dude got cooked by 36 year old Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley
Gonna need Prime Dwight Howard and Prime Gary Payton just to make that team average on defense.
"It would be the ECF in that case, so yeah he‚Äôll be averaging insane numbers considering he‚Äôll play like 45 minutes a game due to our backup being Dwight Howard"
"I know what you mean but Raptors want their big to be a 3 point threat and that's why they went for Baynes. But Baynes has been awful this season, especially from 3. In the off season, Baynes for that price looked like a steal for the raptors but no one expected him to regress that much. It was the right move at the time, but now that we know Baynes can't provide a 3 point threat either, Dwight Howard would have been the much better option. But, Hindsight is 20/20 and as a 76ers fan, you should be overjoyed that you have one of the best Back up centers in the leagu e"
Ibaka? Gasol? Make a run at Christian Wood? Take a flyer on Harry Giles? Willey Cauley Stein? Harrell? Juan Hernangomez? Dwight Howard? Literally anyone but the worst starting centre in the league would have been just fine
You could get Dwight Howard to do the same thing for a veterans minimum.
"Honestly, and I don't say this to be mean, most people are too swayed by media bullshit and stat sheets, and don't WATCH GUYS play.  Old guys are great to have in LIMITED roles, because they have the skills, but maybe not the physical ability anymore.    Like, your Marc Gasol example.... He was clearly FUCKING WASHED. He was already splitting time with Serge during 2019, was hurt a ton in 2020, and already can't jump, move, and is reluctant to shoot.   But, because it was the Lakers and Marc had a rep for defensive savvy, people just ignored that he could obviously not replace Dwight and Javale who are athletic players. Howard was always good as he's been! People just hated him as a personality and didn't want to feature him. But given the minutes, he got boards, points, and bullied people. Even in Charlotte. He got hurt in Washington and everyone acted like he sucked.  On the flipside, Melo could still score. The Rockets basically smeared him and blackballed him because they expected him to be a young player that just ran around and stood in the corner. Which was dumb. He's on the Blazers and does great.   Blake will be great for the Nets, because he's a backup 4. Blake as a backup 4 man is amazing. He can allow the Nets scorers and shooters to run free cuz he's a great ball handler and distributor."

"&gt;Sometimes I wonder why it more popular before Dwight showed up.  Well, you need a center who can own the lane, and those are relatively rare.  The three players mentioned in this thread so far are Wilt Chamberlain, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Dwight Howard -- which is fairly-rare air in those terms.  Without a center who defend and rebound at a world-class level, this is a difficult strategy to execute.  Especially before the 3-point line, when your mediocre defensive centers needed help from defensive-minded forwards -- otherwise you'd get killed inside and never make enough jump shots to counter that."
Zion will have a worse career than Dwight Howard
"&gt; Multiple all-nba is exceeding expectations as a #1 pick.  Let's see how many #1 picks have 2 all-nba team selections or more.

Don‚Äôt forget that Jimmy also got injured in game 1 and wasn‚Äôt at full strength for the series and then got concussed by Dwight Howard at the end of game 5.
Yes Dwight Howard &gt; Damian Jones
Dwight Howard will become the new big dick nick
How could Marc Gasol make us miss all these 3s?! We need Dwight Howard Back!!!!
"Dwight gets dinged for being a dingbat but was a top 5 player at his peak and maybe the best player in the world in the late 2000s. He was an elite defense on his own, one of the greatest pick and roll lob threats and rebounders ever, the magic made the finals with hedo turkoglu as his best teammate.    Ewing was great too, losing to MJ without a teammate near pippens level over and over, usually in 7.  He played a little more like embiid than howard, not peaking as high as howard but could anchor a top quality unit on both sides for over a decade.  Both are no worse than the second best player in franchise history and deserve a little more respect than i‚Äôm feeling for them on this thread."
Guess Embiid will become an emeny of Philadelphia in 3 years and traded to the pacers   Or Dwight howard becomes BDN and leads us to a finals win over the defending champion Lakers  Pick one outcome
"I don't mean this with any disrespect or anything. I'm not an old time basketball fan. I was under the impression that Ewing was just one of many ""very good players but never really won anything"" that exist during a generation of players. Something akin to Dwight Howard before he ringed as a role player. Is that inaccurate? I ask because I'm surprised at him being compared to Jeter who was a household name not only in sport but for general celebrity as well."
2007 to 2014 Dwight Howard was all time level of play. The 09 and 10 Magic team were really fun
PG: Goran Dragic  SG: Dwyane Wade   SF: Lebron James   PF: Tim Duncan  C: Dwight Howard
A overdose of defence please. Can't handle seeing us give up 80pts in the paint to Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard or every fucking center in this league.
David Robinson's peak on offense is what Dwight Howard should/could have been.
"Current Embiid on his best day is better than Dwight was. Current Embiid on a normal day is worse than Dwight was. The biggest difference? Dwight's first six years he missed three games and played about 35 minutes a game. Embiid's first six years had two full missed seasons and no season of 65 games, playing 30 minutes a game.  If Embiid played almost every game for a few years at his current level then he has a case, but flashes don't make a career and Dwight played winning basketball with all-time defense on a team he was carrying for 7 years and then became a phenomenal second option on a team that would have been championship threats were it not for the greatest team of all time.  Embiid's career so far is fantastic but it has three major asterisks that make it almost impossible to rate him above legitimate superstars. Health, consistency and playoff success. Embiid has an All-NBA, All-Defense teammate, Howard had Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis but has had way more playoff success."
Disagree. He couldn‚Äôt even hold Dwight Howard in the finals
"Here   https://www.sportscasting.com/dwight-howard-lets-everyone-know-what-happened-between-him-and-the-lakers/  ""Haynes reports that the Lakers reportedly never gave a formal offer to Howard, and instead, they had a ‚Äúdeal concept.‚Äù He was then forced to delete the tweet.  Then, while waiting to hear back from the Lakers to see if he had an official offer to accept, Howard accepted a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers.""  Deal concept in place and we were about to offer the real one when he accepted with Philly"
Dwight Howard is already on the sixers tho

"A mix between Gobert and Mutombo on defense  Offensively, it depends. But I think he would be a 15ppg lock. May be 20ppg.  At his prime... Could've been a 22/13 +3 blocks easily. I mean... Those are peak Dwight Howard numbers"

"Oh boy, let‚Äôs fucking GO.   First off. Melo era Knicks, name 5 other players from that era who played with Melo in their prime? How many of them are even in the hall of pretty good careers?   Second off, Melo is there one of the great scorers of all time (notice my terminology I‚Äôm not saying the best). He‚Äôs somewhere in that tier 2A range. He happened to me overlap with a lot of great scorers during the period of Lebron, KG, Kobe, Steph etc. he‚Äôs never been the best scorer of the league but he‚Äôs spent most of his career being too 3 behind 1 and 2 who are first ballot HOFers.  Why should the Knicks retire his jersey? If you‚Äôre a top 5 to top 10 NBA player that spent most of your career at a shitty franchise that didn‚Äôt do dick for you throughout your prime, they deserve to send you some recognition. One could argue that the greatest supporting cast Melo EVER had was the absolutely insane era of Linsanity. The greatest support he ever had was a fucking Basketball anomaly. Yet he spent the prime of his career carrying your shitty ass franchise as a top 5 or top 10 player depending on the year? You back that up with reciprocated respect.   Basketball, for all the individual accomplishments we talk about it, is a team sport. I‚Äôm not going to shit talk Dwight Howard for never winning in Orlando the same way Portland shouldn‚Äôt shit talk Dame for not winning I. Portland. Btw the super teams in the east didn‚Äôt help his career at all.   If it was any team but the Knicks, lakers, celtics or anyone in that reign it wouldn‚Äôt even be a question."
"Let's go through our bench.  Dwight Howard: Very solid backup Center in limited minutes. Strong on D, okay on O with quite a few dumb mistakes. Count on 8 points, 12 boards and 4 Fouls (with 2 of them being Offensive)  Shake Milton: Supposedly our 6th man. Started season very hot, hurt his ankle and has not been able to hit the broad side of a barn since. Always been a streaky player, but this is exceedingly cold. Had a nice bounce back later in the game, but still a bad shooting game.  Furkan Korkmaz: The most divisive player on the bench. He's just as likely to go off for 25 points and 6 3s as he is to turn it over 6 times in 8 minutes. Goes ungodly cold and nuclear hot at random, but also likes to play like he's Lebron for some reason. Liability on D, but active enough that he can sometimes cheese a steal.  Matisse Thybulle: Legitimately one of the best defenders in the NBA, but is having a horrendous offensive season. Shooting something like 35/25/60. Gets plenty of play because he's good for 3+ steals in 12 minutes, but really bogs down the offense.  The rest of the bench are all pretty much scrubs or rookies that will not see play in the playoffs."

Mitch didn‚Äôt get a lot of high draft picks during his Lakers tenure but he has a very good track record.  He‚Äôs a really good GM who‚Äôs getting a lot of bad rap because of how it ended in LA. Around 17 years as GM and signed/traded for these names but is mostly remembered for Deng and Mosgov contracts:  Karl Malone Gary Payton Andrew Bynum Trevor Ariza Pau Gasol Ron Artest Chris Paul Steve Nash Dwight Howard
This is cap. Dwight Howard averaged .88 PPP on post ups in 2011-2012. That would rank him 41st out of 57 players in the league today who average 1 or more post ups per game this season. That's the same PPP on post ups as Mason Plumlee.    He was not a good post player ever by any stretch of the imagination.
"The problem is that 2011 Dwight Howard demanded the ball constantly too and didn't want to be a ""complementary player""."
"Embiid no question. Dwight was a 3x reigning DPOY which is great, but Embiid is no slouch on defense. He is a 2x All-Defensive second team selection, and a perennial contender for DPOY every year. And then there‚Äôs the offense - where Embiid is so far ahead of Howard that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not even a question to me who is better overall. Embiid is a legitimate offensive weapon from just about anywhere on the floor this season. Howard may have averaged a nice 22ppg, but he never had a go-to post move or even a 12-foot jumper. This years Embiid all day for me."
"According to the article Gasol is considered a borderline bust?  I thought they were just saving him for the Playoffs.  They knew he was ring-hunting and not the same guy from 3-4 Years ago.  What were they expecting out of Gasol, another DPOY?  I can't believe I'm saying this as a Lakers fan, but letting Dwight Howard go was a big mistake.  His defense and rebounding was a perfect fit, and he even tweeted like he was staying so the Lakers blew it.  They should have run another ""Stay D12"" campaign again after 2020, only this time it wouldn't have been embarrassing like it was the first time."
Also here's a fun fact: Dwight Howard and Josh Smith were teammates on an AAU team in HS.
"Really? Admittedly, I don't have a counter-example to offer up as a better place for LMA to end up, but the Lakers don't seem like a team which needs Aldridge. If the Lakers need a center, it seems like they need someone who can fill the McGee/Howard role from last year as a full-sized center who can provide some vertical spacing. Aldridge doesn't provide those things. I'm not saying Damian Jones is the solution for the Lakers, but he's a closer fit *in theory*, albeit nowhere near as good as Javale or Dwight."
"Yeah, aside from the part where he said was in the running for best center with Dwight Howard for best center in the league it was pretty good"
"Is Ben Wallace career an all time great nba career? Why is everyone using him as a comparison? Instead of Dwight Howard, Dennis Rodman and so on?"
How can you pick just one? Change a few of these and the Magic could have been a dynasty from 99-05ish.  Nick Anderson free throws  Shaq leaving  Penny getting injured &amp; leaving  Duncan not signing with us  Grant Hill's 9000 injuries  TMac tanking his 4th year with us because he played with dogshit teammates &amp; getting himself traded - if we coulda just kept him to pair with Dwight Howard ... man that would have been fun  Courtney Lee's tough miss in the 09 Finals  VC choking in the 2010 ECF  Dwightmare
still younger than Dwight Howard
"You guys can tell me if I‚Äôm being a homer here, but how are Derrick White, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard, and John Wall on this list and Ja Morant isn‚Äôt? How the fuck does that make sense?"
Dwight Howard[4] has more 3s than Ben Simmons[2]
Mark eaton Dwight Howard who?
"Hmm. Idk who the sixers have off the top of my head, but maybe mattise, Dwight Howard, and Danny green?"
Check what dwight howard did against andrew bogut when the rockets matched up in 15 and 16  Chris Paul was great in 2018 then got injured and we lost. In 2019 he had the worst season of his career and played like ass games 1-5 against gsw   Then russ put ups 17/4 on 40% TS  In the playoffs. Anything else?
"Let‚Äôs see James harden has played with Dwight howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. All future hall of famers and dude has had mind blowing terrible performances in the playoffs."
"How many MVPs has Wade won? How many 1st team all NBAs does Wade have? Scoring titles? Harden has been top 2 in MVP 4 times, Wade has made 2 1st teams.   Harden has 3 scoring titles, Wade has 1.   Like, maybe let‚Äôs say the MVP versus the finals MVP is a wash. Harden has still had the longer and better peak.  Also, harden has never played with prime Lebron James. He‚Äôs played with a past his prime Dwight Howard, a past his prime Chris Paul, and past his prime Westbrook, and for a lot of that time he was going up against one of the greatest dynasties ever."
First year of Dwight Howard on the rockets was just as good if not better then shaq on the heat. 2006 wade was a one man wrecking crew.
"We have overwhelming support (29 upvotes) for top 20, but apparently no consensus feeling (net zero) towards top 10. Can we agree on say 12th-13th? Dwight Howard is the 13th best center in the league?"
*Dwight Howard turning back the clock*
I remember a clip of him boxing out Dwight Howard. That was good technique from him.
"My bad, was responding a couple of posts above to  u/inshamblesx about this offseason. My comment got lost in the overall thread.  I don't disagree he's inefficient, but some of that in Charlotte can be chalked up to his best teammate being who? Nic Batum, Dwight Howard, and Al Jefferson? Those Charlotte teams he had ZERO help so of course he's going to be a volume guy (a lot like Beal is right now, except Beal is a better scorer). This year I kind of blame the injury, as he's having his worst shooting year since 2014-15. I mean, could he be regressing back to that? Sure, but part of it has to do with the knee and him being less quick to his spots. He was an iron man in Charlotte, that's not really Ainge's fault.  Smart I agree has been less of a positive impact than in past years, but with their defense being so shaky, even if he has not been as good, can you really trade him when Boston has no defensive identity? It's a tricky situation that I think is going to depend on how Langford looks and then you can use either Brown/Fournier/Langford at the 2 spot and trade Smart when his value is at its highest (a lot of teams would want him and we could get a good return), or Brown/Smart/Langford. Fournier seems more like insurance to see what the team does in the playoffs as a Hayward-lite and what to do going forward. We do have his bird rights so we have flexibility there. But I can only guess on this, I'm not a GM.  This is a weird year overall with COVID impacting every team. How can you accurately assess an unprecedented situation? This applies to all teams.  Harden, KD and Westbrook were 3 very good players. KD was 2nd in MVP voting with 28 and 8, Westbrook was 12th in MVP voting with 24/5/6. Harden was 6th man of the year. Ibaka was 2nd in DPOY. You know who has a similar comp to that? Last year LeBron was 2nd in MVP, AD was 2nd in DPOY, Harrell won 6th man. The Lakers are a championship level team. Tatum, Brown and Kemba are not on that level. But we can't get LeBron.  I know you were responding to everyone I listed, but it's cherry picking to say PG and Melo got out (didn't win) and so did LeBron and Durant (did win), but then you can flip it around and say Lillard has been loyal (hasn't won) but then again so has Steph Curry (has won). And I know it's kind of an era ago, but Dirk eventually got a ring, Duncan never left and got a ring in 2014 against LeBron. Giannis might stay in Milwaukee his whole career and may win a ring, he may not. Lowry stayed in Toronto his whole career and they won because they honestly got lucky landing Kawhi and the GS injuries that finals. He only wanted to leave SA because of how they handled his injury. And there's a difference between Simmons wanting out and getting traded is my point. Brown was mentioned as a trading piece if we went after Harden. Would Harden be a better duo with JT than Brown is? Sure.  But building super teams or amassing a bunch of talent doesn't always work. The 2012 Lakers, PG to the Thunder, Lob City Clippers,  the Rockets ""helped"" Harden REPEATEDLY with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, then Russell Westbrook and he still demanded to be traded. It's playing with fire if as a GM you mortgage the future to build a contender now and it doesn't work. Clippers traded away a bunch of picks to land PG. What if they don't win? Milwaukee traded away picks to get Jrue, are they going to beat Brooklyn or Philadelphia? Everyone laughs about it now since the Nets are good, but when Billy King traded to get Garnett and Pierce to be competitive, dude got fired for how that ended up and is the only reason we have Tatum and Brown in the first place.  So if your concern is about their prime and fear they might want out, let me give you 2 scenarios:  1. Trade (because this year's FA doesn't have anyone that makes them contenders with how loaded Brooklyn is) for whoever is available now that is *very* good to put them over the top and teams are willing to just give you despite Ainge's reputation, and competing with Brooklyn's 3 All-Stars and all top 10 players, the Lakers having the best player in the world and Anthony Davis with our undersized front court, Philadelphia and Milwaukee loading up, and try to win as many championships as possible in the next 2-3 years before guaranteed rebuilding. 2. Keep your perennial playoff team good by putting pieces around your budding superstars and be an attractive FA destination, let these aging super teams fade in 2023 RIGHT when Tatum/Brown are in their prime and Brooklyn's big 3 contracts run out, Milwaukee has no 2023 first round draft pick as a trading chip, Embiid's contract is up and that's a serious question Philly has to answer if they want to pay an injury-prone big man when Harris and Simmons are both making over $30M, Kemba will be off the books freeing up cap space, LeBron will be 39 going on 40, and you can almost certainly bet a good team now is going to blow it up before then if they loaded up and don't win.  Flexibility is way more important right now than worrying about this season, because we aren't getting LeBron, Kawhi, Curry, Durant, Harden, Luka, or Giannis, and honestly, who else is worth it if we're REALLY trying to win now. Ainge pulled the trigger on MVP winner Kevin Garnett and the game's best shooter at the time in Ray Allen. Absolutely no way he does that for a guy to help Tatum/Brown unless he is MVP caliber in the current NBA landscape."
"Dwight is bitter sweet as hell. He‚Äôs not a great fit but he‚Äôs very much not washed. I love watching him play. Philly eats up his bullshit too, it‚Äôs kinda a match made in heaven. He‚Äôs also like an A+ citizen like he‚Äôs been a good mentor. Like I never thought I would say that stuff about Dwight Howard."
"Read ""Dwight Howard gets..."" and immediately thought he got ejected again lmao. Nice play!"
Dwight Howard has entered the locker room
"Backup PG =&gt; Brunson  Consistency =&gt; Too vague so I don't know what you mean by that  Rebounding =&gt; Who should we trade for? Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capela , Enes Kanter , Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson?  I suppose we should offer their current team all our first round picks and give them a max contract post trade.  I think you are searching too hard for holes. Mavs don't need to be perfect to become champions. A little better team than right now and with some winners luck, they can get it done."

BREAKING: Dwight Howard requests trade to Washington!
Dwight fouled a lot and went for blocks way too often the lakers were deep enough to usually only really play Howard when there was a mismatch   In the playoffs he hardly played except against Denver. Houston he was unplayable and Portland kind of too cause they‚Äôd kill him in the pick n roll (lillard and McCollum)  Against Miami he barely barely played and he could not guard Bam at all  He was cool in the regular season but he really didn‚Äôt play a lot in the playoffs cause AD at the 5 is just too good

"Look up how many minutes Dwight played in the Finals. Look at Rondo's counting stats, on-off impact, whatever stat you want across the playoffs and the finals. Both the eye test and advanced stats can tell you that Howard was not some ""force off the bench"" and Rondo played well, but he was tied with Caruso as the fourth best player on our team at best. KCP clearly was the third best player.      We didn't even have Rondo in the first series, and Dwight played a grand total of 15 minutes in the second series. Did we struggle against those teams? NO.      There's literally nothing that suggests our success was dependent on Rondo or Dwight in the playoffs. If you're so inclined on making your point, please pull up any combination of stats that suggests otherwise."

"&gt; Lakers added Schroeder who‚Äôs definitely an upgrade over rondo  I don't think you watched him play last season in the playoffs.  &gt; Marc and now Drummond it‚Äôs at most a slight downgrade over Dwight probably an upgrade as well  Injured and a complete wildcard. Howard fit perfectly into the system, we have no idea how their 5 rotation will be this time around."
"I see your point, but what if Brett Brown was such dog shit that any replacement was gonna get solid results from adding Maxey, Curry, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard while Embiid was putting up MVP season. Coaches can only really be judged through playoff success anyway so Doc's run with the Sixers is still a question mark, I remember when Bucks fans loved Bud lol"
Could easily been a Dwight Howard quote
Dwight Howard liked that
Yeah last night was an ex of when he didnt really give a shit about playing defense it does happen. Ive also kind of just learned over time with perimeter defenders this happens with everybody there being reg season nights they just dont bring it see it with someone like a Marcus Smart.  Off ball he's never going to have Draymond esque defensive recognition instincts which is part of why I dont think he's DPOY caliber. Other thing is getting over screens which can be tough at 6'11. I also dont really trust guys like Dwight Howard and Mike Scott to be calling out where and when the screen is coming properly which matters lately.
"Overrated is difficult, because many NBA reporters point such declines out relatively fast and, like with Kawhi or Lebron in prior seasons, it is sometimes just star players saving energy.   My pick for most overrated is actually a great defender, who also gets a lot of amazing help defense from his teammates and whose defensive impact gets overrated, because many people believe perimeter defense is really important:   Ben Simmons, who some demand should get DPOY for being versatile, when impact-wise Embiid is the better defender on his own team and Dwight Howard is a bigger reason than Simmons, that the defense stays great after Embiid's injury.   Simmons is still a great perimeter defender and should absolutely make 1st All Defense, but that is it, centers are just way more important defenders and drum roll, please: **It's not even close! The whole conversation about it is horribly stupid! There is no case whatsoever!**  &amp;#x200B;  Underrated are actually quite a lot of players.   ""Rookie X is so bad on defense, total liability!"" Well, yeah, that's about 80% of all rookies and way too often the narrative sticks for too long, when the players have already developed a better understanding for defense. Were they still so terrible, they wouldn't be in the rotation in their 4th year in the league or so, especially most role players, incredible bench scorers aside.   I would nominate Devin Booker, who improved over the years and is now at the level of ""Doesn't help bad defenses, doesn't drag down good ones."""
"It doesn't really :( the only thing I can think of was the Mavs basically blowing up their championship team to try and get Deron Williams and Dwight Howard in free agency, but I can't remember any other championship team where the best player left without coming back when they had the chance to contend again."
Minutes per game in the 2020 NBA finals:  Anthony Davis: 38.2 Dwight Howard: 11.8 Javale Mcgee: &lt; 1  Who the fuck was playing center for the vast majority of lakers minutes if it wasn‚Äôt Davis?  I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm arguing with a Lakers fan about whether or not Davis should be playing at the 5 or the 4
It's how I feel about guys like Dwight Howard.  Got paid millions and never admit you have a gaping hole in your game and work on it.   It makes me see the work guys like Nowitzki did to try and comback each off season better at something  truly impressive.   Guy went from looking like a euro bust to in the conversation for best PF in the league.   Every year he came back with  some new skill he worked on over the summer (some more impressive than others)

First off Dwight Howard should‚Äôve won that MVP and by no means was D rose the best basketball player in the world that year. It was still Lebron
"Donnie Nelson wanted to draft Giannis really badly, but Cuban said no to create more cap space to go after Dwight Howard in free agency, so the Mavs traded down in the draft for a cheaper 1st round rookie contract."
"You‚Äôre rounding 26.4 up to 27 PPG and you‚Äôre rounding 62.4 up to 64%? Either use decimals or round properly.  2011 Dwight Howard: 22.9 PPG with an eFG% 9.5% above league average (2P% 11% over average)  2021 Zion: 26.4 PPG with an eFG% 9.3% above league average (2P% 10.1% over average)  You can claim cherry picking and round up stats to inflate them all you want, but there‚Äôs no reason that Dwight Howard (playing in a tougher era) should be this close to someone who‚Äôs an All-Time great scorer. He might be some day, but he isn‚Äôt now.  And if you‚Äôre an All-Time great scorer then FT‚Äôs and eFG% (that accounts for other players shooting 3‚Äôs) also matter.  Zion scores almost all of his points from within 0-3 feet and shoots 70% from there. 2011 Dwight shot 75% from there and a real All-Time great like Giannis or Shaq had seasons where they were from 75%-82% while also scoring on higher volume.  He might get there someday, but he isn‚Äôt yet. Zion also having a PER that‚Äôs 1.8 above Jimmy Butlers isn‚Äôt really a large factor considering all the other advanced stats put Jimmy above Zion pretty easily."
"&gt; Absolute abomination that Duncan never won DPOY.   Quite a bit of context is missing here.  Duncan is also one of extremely few players\* to play with two different DPOY -- Robinson and Leonard -- plus 8-time All-defensive Bruce Bowen.  Without one of those three as a teammate, Duncan anchored Spurs' defenses rated 8th, 10th, and 11th, which is very unremarkable.  For two of those seasons Duncan also had Danny Green, another all-D teammate.  \*LeBron James has played with Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, and Marc Gasol, obviously, but none were close to DPOY level at that time.  A few other Spurs also played with David Robinson and Dennis Rodman, but Rodman was years' removed from that level of play/sanity.  Some 2020 Clippers played with Leonard and Joakim Noah -- the latter for 5 games.  That's how rare Duncan's defensive teammates are, which should be taken into account.  &gt; also shows that even as a 40 year old and after declining that the Big Fundamental was still great on defense.   Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated Spurs' defenses without Duncan.  Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th, as noted above.  &gt; including the greatest defensive rating in the modern era (2004)   Not coincidentally, in the second-lowest scoring season in the modern era.  Crediting Duncan for that, is disingenuous to the extreme.  His defense is wildly overrated."
Dwight Howard got shit on for saying basically the same thing before.  Will be interesting to see the difference in reactions.
That was mostly due to you guys being matched up against the Celtics small ball lineup though. Any traditional big would be at a real disadvantage against such a team. Like Dwight Howard definitely wasn't washed last year but the Lakers still had to sit him against Houston cause they played small. If you guys had played Philly instead he probably would have been much more useful.
"Dwight ""I will do better"" Howard"
"Yes lol, he‚Äôs like the Dwight Howard of point guards"
Dwight Howard should get a flagrant 2 for that mess he's calling hair
The game very rapidly moved past him. He was signed with the world thinking that stopping Dwight Howard and the Lakers was necessary to make it to the finals in the west. That obviously didn‚Äôt go as expected and suddenly a strong but slow grinder big man with no offensive utility was a massive liability.
"""Ahhhhhhh!""  --Dwight Howard"
"And your a tone deaf Rockets fan who most likely pumped those role players up in the past but are now trying to downgrade them to make your argument sound better. Those are really good role players to have. Harden has had awesome role players as well as superstars like CP3, Westbrook, and Dwight Howard. Dwight has a ring, CP3 made a bad Sun's team really good, and Westbrook is once again playing at a historic level. Unfortunately he ran everybody out of Houston with his poor leadership skills. But that's another story in itself. This guy has a different superstar on his team every year.  Also I never once said Harden is bad. He can win a regular season MVP by jacking up crazy shots, stat padding against terrible teams, and foul hunting all he wants. He gets exposed every year in the playoffs.   Hope the Nets enjoy their shame ring this year. You better believe the rules will get changed to stop this bullshit from happening. Harden is a cupcake just like Durant and Kyrie. They run from challenges and look for the easiest route to a ring. They are turning the NBA into the Harlem Globetrotters."
"Dwight Howard needed back SURGERY for a herniated disc, David Robinson never had to get a back surgery.  Back surgery is life changing and definitely the primary reason dwight's production changed."
"It‚Äôs a good thing the Lakers only need him to catch lobs, and rebound, not be 2009 Dwight Howard. He‚Äôs undoubtedly talented and physically gifted, and you think getting him on the minimum isn‚Äôt a steal? Lebron makes everyone better kiddo I‚Äôm sorry"
"Because Dwight Howard was an athletic, defensive, and rebounding monster. He didn‚Äôt have an arsenal of post moves, or a shooting touch, but he used his strengths well.   Orlando built a great team around him, he was really good at drawing attention in the post and kicking it out to the open man. 4 out.  But then he struggled passing out of double teams, athletically declined with the bad back, and never polished his skills so the decline was tough."
That's not unique to Dwight. If you recall the initial injury that led to David Robinson missing the season - which netted the Spurs Tim Duncan - was a back injury followed by a broken foot. Robinson was still great but not quite the same afterward. However Robinson had versatility that allowed him to play a significant role alongside Duncan. Likewise even Ewing with his famously creaky knees could still score well in his mid 30s despite limited mobility because he had good skills.   I agree the back injury likely prevented Howard from reaching a higher peak but at this point I don't think that's the main problem with Howard. It's that he lacks versatility compared to other great centers and the current NBA isn't friendly to such big man.
I remember when Van Gundy told the media that Dwight Howard wanted him fired. I wonder if there are other instances of people actually being honest to the media.
"Why do bad free throw shooters always take so long at the line? I remember hearing similar criticisms for Dwight Howard, Andre Drummond, Russ, and even LeBron"
Dwight Howard?
"They want stars in major markets. This entire league is run by nothing but greedy money-grubbing douchelords who would really rather just see New York vs LA every night if the ratings were high and the precious international market dgaf about the middle of the country  Notice how nobody was trying to push anyone towards Cleveland when we were the champs, it was all about where they should put LeBron next. They couldn‚Äôt get KD and Harden out of Oklahoma and into Houston or San Fran fast enough, and basically told Blake Griffin to shut it down so they could put him in NYC. Who was the last superstar Free Agent to sign in San Antonio? They were a DYNASTY and every single star they had from David Robinson to Kawhi Leonard was drafted. How about Dallas? OKC? For a team like Denver, Utah, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Portland, etc to be successful they either to hit in the draft or just get really lucky with putting together the right mix of guys nobody else wanted...and hit in the draft. Look at the last champions who did it through FA, LA, Miami, Boston, San Fran in the KD years (Cleveland runs riot without him there), LA again in the Shaq and Kobe era not to mention guys like Dwight Howard, and Ron ‚ÄúMeta World Peace‚Äù Artest. I guarantee if they took away profit sharing, we would find out some real shady shit from the smaller market guys. Keep owners paid, and they are happy. The draft lottery is rigged as hush money as well. Bet"
"Clint Capella, Westbrook, CP3, Ariza, PJ, Dwight Howard just to name a few of the many good to great NBA players he has had in Houston. He got desperate and forced a trade to form a team of guys who want easy rings and cake walk to the finals. The spirit of competition means nothing. Harden is what you would call a gamey player. The problem is the refs swallow their whistles in post season so his bullshit doesn't work. The ole Harden drive with a head snap back to simulate him getting punched doesn't work in playoffs. Or the ole stepback three with leg kick forward doesn't work."
Yeah thing is regardless of knowing who is most deserving these awards just matter. The way we talk about Derrick Rose vs Dwight Howard changes drastically based on who won the award in 2011. Same with All NBA teams etc. A hypothetical completely undeserving candidate winning still benefits massively long term.   The fortunate thing is I think this year is an outlier year. Most seasons the winner is fairly clear cut to where politics/clout/access cant do enough to change it. Or at least a 2017 situation where as long as one of the 3 legit deserving candidates won it Im fine with that.
"Okay, here's another article from December of 2010 arguing that Howard is the leading MVP candidate.  Yes, the article is on SB Nation's Orlando Pinstriped blog, but it also cites ESPN's Zach Lowe.  The quote from Lowe:  &gt;Howard is the centerpiece for everything Orlando does on both ends, and he remains unmatched in his ability to both protect the rim and rush out to disrupt pick-and-rolls. His traditional stats are as good as ever, and he ranks fourth in the league in Player Efficiency Rating.  And yes, people did care about efficiency back then:  &gt;Howard's scoring a career-best 21.3 points per game on 59.4 percent True Shooting. Only Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks and Kevin Martin of the Houston Rockets have scored more points more efficiently than Howard this season, and neither contributes nearly as much in other areas as Howard.

Or is that your intent?"
I watched the whole game and stand by what I said. Howard was owning him on every box out and Trez got his feelings hurt. Then Dwight blocked the shit out of him and was in his face. None of those techs happen without Trez being a giant baby.
"Here's a random article I Googled from 2011 arguing Howard was the MVP.  Choice quote: ""No player means more to his offense than Howard.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/661586-2011-nba-awards-dwight-howard-is-the-true-mvp-of-the-season?search_query=Dwight%20Howard%29  And yes, I was around.  I'm old."
"You're really out here trying to say that a team who had:  Dwight howard force his way there via trade  signed Steve Nash and Lebron James in free agency  and had even more players try to force their way there like Chris Paul ""haven't had interest from stars? lol  Ok, you say that's too recent, let's go back farther and look at a few free agent signings:  - Rajon Rondo  - KCP  - Derek Fisher  - Ron Artest  - Horace Grant  - Karl Malone  - Gary Payton  - Mitch Richmond   - Ron Harper  - Rick Fox  - Shaq  - Magic Johnson  is 30 years enough or should we go farther?"
"So I see he is still in the Dwight Howard on the rockets phase, When he doesn't realize that he's merely a role player yet.  Drop in lakers fans this is gonna be fun."
"High defensive IQ? 1000%. Just watch Dwight Howard on defense and you can clearly see how well he understands how to play defense in the NBA. His athleticism has decayed alot, but he still knows."
"&gt;	Ever since they created the DPoY award, defensive specialists just don't get considered for MVP  Dwight Howard lol"
He's saying Dwight Howard was/is a player with high defensive IQ
dwight howard did this so much that [it indirectly lead to being suspended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dimOsindqig)
I remember when Paul Pierce got the refs to call it on Dwight Howard and Howard almost got kicked out of the game lmao    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkRebnenSGk
So he wants what Dwight Howard wanted until he was almost out of the league
So you're saying Dwight Howard is a high IQ player?
"Marcus ""Dwight Howard"" Smart"
"Howard AND McGee playoff averages were a combined 25 mpg  McGee played about 10 min, Dwight about 15 min  Drummond can easily eat up a half of basketball no problem"
Is it Dwight Howard?
"Your argument is valid to say that Draymond is a great defender, which he obviously is, but we are talking about the GREATEST DEFENDER OF ALL TIME.  The Warriors defense was great, yes, for today's standards and for a grand total of three years. In 2018, the Warriors ranked 11th on defense and then 13th in 2019, people are here talking like the Warriors were the 2000s Pistons who had to hold teams to 80 points to win games, this is was the greatest collection of talent EVER, their defense was hardly the main or 2nd reason they were great.  Is Draymond Green a versatile defender? Absolutely, but he ain't a all-time great perimeter 1 on 1 defender, plain and simple. We are comparing him to guys like Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard and Dikembe Mutombo, dudes that not only are more decorated than he is, but that have the stats to prove how much better and impactful they were.  David Robinson led this league in DWS and DBPM three times, led the Spurs to top tier defenses for almost a decade and his teams actually relied on defense to win games. Scottie Pippen did exist and was the same height of Draymond, guarded point guards, wings and power forwards and people on this sub are acting like Draymond is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Draymond also didn't play with scrubs on defense, he anchored that Warriors defense, but he also had the help of truly good defenders like Klay, Bogut and Iguodala."
"He is and that's the point, just a decade ago there was a guy that was CLEARLY more impactful and more athletic than Green on defense, who had all the intangibles that people like to throw around Green (you can say everything about Dwight, but he has great defensive BBIQ), but he was simply bigger, stronger, more athletic and maybe even faster.  Those people saying that Draymond has a claim for defensive GOAT show that they absolutely didn't watch Howard in his prime, because if they had they would see how absurdly higher his impact was. Dwight led Orlando to be one of the best defenses in the league without having any other truly ""great"" defender alongside him and without having the benefit of playing with the greatest offense of all time on the other end."
"&gt; Lol guards can't even guard Dame or Kyrie, FOH.  I seem to recall CP3 eating Dame's lunch in their matchup in 2016, in fact when CP3 got hurt was when Dame actually played well in the series. Jrue Holiday also guarded Dame exceptionally well in their 2018 matchup, so yeah, hardly ""unguardable"".  &gt; Do I think Draymond is the best defender of all time? It's literally an impossible, and pointless, question to answer.  No it isn't, as his claim isn't backed up by awards (there are countless all-time great defenders who are more decorated than he is), by stats (Draymond shockingly has never led this league in DWS and only led it in DBPM twice) or by the eye test. Dwight Howard won three straight DPOYs, led the league in blocks twice, led it in DWS four times in a row and in DBPM once. Also, the eye test CLEARLY showed that Howard was WAY more impactful than Green was on defense.  &gt; team defense, switch ability, recognition/awareness, communication, etc etc all matter.  Yes, let's act like Draymond Green is the only all-time great defender that has those skills, as if Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwight, Pippen and many others didn't have all those skills AND were more athletically gifted with better individual defensive prowess.  &gt; Yeah Draymond is gonna get burnt by some guards  Tell me one instance where Draymond Green has successfully guarded an elite NBA guard for an extended period of time. You won't find it, because Klay takes all the defensive assignments on guards and when Draymond gets switched on to them, he is neither fast or athletic enough to stay in front of them. Draymond couldn't guard Kyrie, Dame, Mitchell, Murray, you name it, he simply doesn't have the athletic abilities to guard a quick small guard.  &gt; Once again, not saying he's the best defender of all time.  You don't have to, he isn't even close. Ben Wallace was CLEARLY better (backed up by stats AND individual awards) than Draymond Green and anchored an actual all-time great defense on a team that didn't have the greatest offense in NBA history, so they actually had to hold opponents to less than 80 points to win."
"Anyone who is upset about the nets doing buy outs look at blake griffin, he's not good. Older stars who are past their prime are fun to have on contenders.   Dwight howard and rondo being on the lakers last year was fun."
All ima say is people said a similar thing about Dwight Howard with the Lakers.
"Dwight was not getting position. He was leaning on Trez to be an asshole and get him mad. Yes, he pushed Howard, you‚Äôre allowed to swipe a guy off of you when he‚Äôs doing stuff like this. The contact between Howard and Trez when Howard was leaning on him and pushing into him with his hands is not supposed to be allowed to continue. That‚Äôs 100% on Howard.   He was intentionally walking into Trez for no reason except to harass him more or start a fight. People are confused because they‚Äôre not seeing the whole clip, it‚Äôs obvious Dwight bumped him intentionally when you see it. I think there‚Äôs confusion too because refs usually don‚Äôt see the initial thing and only the retaliation, but Howard was being so obvious, and frankly dumb, that they were watching him like a hawk.  That‚Äôs why they knew Trez was not at fault. You can argue Trez would normally get a tech or that Howard should‚Äôve just gotten a tech, but whatever Howard got, Trez needed to get less. This wasn‚Äôt a double tech situation. It‚Äôs not supposed to be equal, if the refs can identify the instigator, they should call it that way."
"If he doesn‚Äôt understand and accept his role next to Lebron and AD nothing, he will never succeed anywhere. If Dwight Howard, a guy that tanked the latter half his career thanks in part to his ego could set it aside with Lebron and AD, Drummond sure as hell can."
Tldr: I cannot allow opponents to Dwight Howard me
Opponents were dumb af back then and offenses were schoolboy level.   There was no real outside shooting. It was just player after player attempting to score near the rim and getting blocked easily by a 7-foot guy.   Dwight Howard in the 60s would have had simiilar stats for sure.
"That ain't the point, the point is that one of the biggest pieces of bullshit ever told in this sub is that Draymond Green can guard guards, no he can't, he couldn't guard a 45 year old Baron Davis, let alone the top tier guards in the league. Draymond is a high IQ versatile defender, he can switch between wings and bigs, but to say that he can guard 1-5 is the biggest piece of crap ever told, he can't guard Dame or Kyrie to save his goddamn life.  The reason Draymond's claim was foolish is because he isn't as good guarding big guys as Tim, Hakeem, Dikembe and Dwight were, he isn't as good as LeBron, Michael, Kobe, GP and Scottie at guarding wing guys and he certainly can't guard small guards.  How can you be the greatest if you aren't the best at anything? Dwight Howard in his prime had more of an argument than Draymond Green (who doesn't even have the accomplishments to go against the very best defenders ever). People on this sub need to understand that versatility =/= best"
"it's more the attitude change in Drummond getting to play with an actual contender (just like Dwight) not necessarily his playing style or body of work, playing for the Pistons and Cavs. before Howard played for the weak ass Rockets, Hawks, Hornets and Wizards.  ALSO not all players need to be big impact, Drummond is a clean up the boards, put that shit back in dirty work, no glamorous guy but end of game fills up the stat sheet with a double double.  We're good with AD/LeBron, need guys like Drummond to just be consistent"
Why do people keep comparing him to Dwight?  They are completely different players in completely different scenarios.  Drummond has never been close to the player Howard was.  Howard geared his body towards putting in max effort into small spurts and was therefore able to make a big impact in small minutes.  Drummond has never been a big impact guy regardless of minutes.
Dwight Howard is way better than Drummond.  Howard's biggest problem was staying focused and taking the game seriously.  Drummond puts in max effort and gets beaten on the defensive end with decent regularity.
[Dwight Howard](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/howardw01.html)  That's his job. Nothing else.
Drummond on that Dwight Howard shit
"cool, they said the same thing about Dwight Howard when he returned last year for the Lakers, was far from it so we'll see"
&gt; Drummond is the only walking 15/15 in the NBA in the past 20 years  Timberwolves Kevins (Love and Garnett)  Tim Duncan  Orlando Dwight Howard  Drummond isn't going to score that much with AD and LeBron being the obvious better options on offense but he's likely taking Dwight's role from last season and dominating teams on the glass
Enes Kanter but thinks he's prime Dwight Howard
I think Dwight Howard from last year's impact will be higher.
i feel like denver has a much better chance against the lakers without dwight howard out there with his sole job to fuck with jokic
"""Rest Up Kyle"" Kyle Lowry will play in tomorows game after a hard screen collision with Dwight Howard"
"Agreed. I think Lebron Vogel Dudley pelinka will make Drummond play a Dwight Howard role. No post ups, only putbacks dunks layups and he solid defensively in the paint"
"I mean it's a lot similar to Dwight Howard joining the Lakers last year. Former stars that were washed as primary options, but are capable of being productive complementary players at the minimum."
Markieff wasnt close to being the 4th best player though. Dwight Howard would be a better answer.
"Nope Cuban was actually right to make a move it was just a bad one. Mavs had NO defense, I don't know why they thought Rondo was really the solution there though.  Rondo was bad but there real problem with that series was Dirk getting abused by Josh Smith and Dwight Howard. Also Chandler wasn't at his old level anymore."
dwight howard
"Toronto won a championship by trading for Kawhi when they didn't think they could keep him. OKC traded for PG13 when they didn't think they could keep him, and ended up keeping him and getting a haul. Philadelphia traded for Jimmy Butler when they didn't think they could keep him. Going back, the Lakers traded for Dwight Howard and then lost him to free agency.  Ignore my flair (because it's easy to just bash on the Lakers). There's only a few teams that can trade for guys and be ""guaranteed"" that they don't leave. Very few teams have a championship window longer than 2/3 years, and those teams are built around 1 superstar talent. Ainge was caught looking ahead and looking back. In hindsight, it's easy to see that Boston should have just pushed their chips in and traded for Kawhi/AD.  All that said: Ainge is an awesome GM, and I don't disagree with his choice to value competing over multiple years rather than pushing for a championship in any given year."
Somehow Dwight Howard still got kicked out.
By this logic Dwight Howard was better than LeBron James in 2009. Yes?
"They also lost Danny Green, Javale McGee and Dwight Howard. Remember Bron and his 2017 side couldn't take down KD, and that was when Bron was more in his prime."
Dwight Howard
Wouldn't it have been simpler in the end for the Lakers to try and convince Dwight Howard to go for a 3-peat?
"Aron ""I made Dwight Howard quit the Lakers"" Baynes."
"Why do you think winning a ring won‚Äôt help his legacy at all? It can literally only help. Being an important part of a championship is a de facto boost in legacy. I don‚Äôt really see how it could be otherwise. People think differently of players like Dwight Howard, for showing they can accept a different role and produce in high-leverage playoff situations. Same principle with Rondo grabbing a second ring off the bench for the lakers last year, Javale w/ the Warriors etc etc"
"Dwight Howard, on teams choosing not to double him all game: ""If you want to stay in the DMs with me, I'm going to be the one to get those cheeks first ... whatever the hell that means."""
"Harrell was courted way earlier by Klutch and Bron. Andre Drummond played for Detroit and so was probably an unknown entity who just happened to become available just as LA needed a body at the 5. And Marc is a consummate professional who's body, not BBIQ or demeanor, is declining.

"It was a rainy Sunday. I was over at Drummond‚Äôs house playing some 2K with him and he paused the game and said he had to go to the bathroom. 15 minutes later he wasnt back so I made my way there. He wasnt there. I walked down to the living room and saw Dre on the couch. Sure enough, he was masturbating to a picture of Dwight Howard in a Lakers jersey. ‚ÄúYou good man?‚Äù I said, and he replied with ‚ÄúYeah just give me a few‚Äù.

"No team was going to give the assets to match contracts to make a trade.  Drummond agreed to a buyout. Now, if that buyout did not include a reduction in Clevelands financial obligation to the extent that the Lakers would pay him, thats a poor negotiation by the Cavs.  An example of both the trade and the buyout situations: Grizz traded CJ Miles (8.7 million) for Dwight Howard (5.6), then waived Dwight Howard shaving off 2.6 million.  With the waiver, Dwight Howard still got every penny he was owed that year, the Lakers just filled in the 2.6 million he gave back to the Grizz. The Grizz saved 2.6 million from D12, and 5.7 mill from where they started off with CJ Miles. And the Lakers got a player for the amount they were willing to pay for him, not at his overvalued price.  If Drummond is more like CJ Miles, he would have had trade value (within the tolerated percentage salary difference). But it seems the Cavs learned he was more like D12, maybe they werent willing to take back a larger contract. Hopefully they got Drummond to give some money back in the buyout."
&gt; giannis  The Bucks are a 3 point team though? They're the modern version of the Dwight Howard Magic.
"Honestly Al Horford missed it by like 3 years. He spent so much of his athletic prime nailing shots 4 feet inside the arc, he would've been so much better if teams committed to having him as their 3 point shooting center. He also got bodied by bigs like Dwight Howard. If he came into the league now he'd be a regular all star, occasional all NBA"
"Having a baby mama is fine, I was specifically thinking of a Dwight Howard situation where you have 5 kids with 5 different women before you‚Äôre 30 - which speaks more to irresponsibility than a deep moral failure IMO, but it‚Äôs still worse than anything Durant has ever done"
He's going to come back with 30 pounds of muscle. Looking like prime Dwight Howard.
"So he ""donated"" to his own charity? That same Mark Zuckerberg trick that even Dwight Howard uses."
"It is and the answer is LeBron  Let me be clear, I don‚Äôt think the champions are decided ahead of time, nor necessarily the playoffs, but they scripted LeBron‚Äôs various moves as well as ensured Cleveland would get the necessary draft picks etc. They also decide how each game will be called and whether to call fouls on things like moving screens (the unofficial MVP of the warriors‚Äô run) or over the back (Dwight Howard in the EC semis). Sometimes it goes wrong, I think Kyrie was meant to be a star in Boston alongside Hayward and reignite the Lakers-celtics rivalry as a LeBron v Kyrie battle"
It can be fixed. Ask Dwight Howard.

"No way. First, the only similarities between Embiid, Jokic, and Ming is that they're tall. That's where the similarities end. Joel Embiid would absolutely DOMINATE Yao Ming in today's NBA and so would Jokic. Players like Yao Ming struggle just to see time on the floor in today's NBA. You either need to be 1) be able to hit mid-range shots at a high clip or hit 3's, or 2) be a really versatile defender and be able to at least not get embarrassed picking up someone on the perimeter. Yao Ming wasn't good at either one of those things. In some ways, Dwight Howard is one of the last traditional bigs in the league but even he had to basically abandon what made him a force in the NBA to extend his career. Today, bigs need to be more like Joel Embiid or KAT than they do Yao Ming. Even Shaq would have to adjust in today's NBA despite what he will tell you. Just ask Roy Hibbert. From the ECF to out of the league in less than 5 years without a single major injury attributing to his early departure. The way players utilize the pick and roll, and the number of bigs that actually participate in the pick-and-pop.. it would just be devastating for someone like Yao Ming. He ain't built for this."

It was one of the most impressive MVP years ever. He should've won it unanimously. But Dwight Howard got a lot of first place votes and LeBron got some as well.
Tall dwight howard
"/u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show *(featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament)*.   MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose *(the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06)*.  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT *(14-25)* on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's *(ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans)*. That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers *(and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots)*.  **26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG%** Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  **17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG%** Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  **19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG%** Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. [Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.](https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rose-dwarfs-other-improvements-with-defense/?_r=0)  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales *that* heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas **37 times that season.**  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;*""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""*  **Jason Kidd**  &gt;*""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.*  **Steve Nash**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""*  **Tyson Chandler**  &gt;*""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""*  **Magic Johnson**  &gt;*""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""*  **Michael Jordan**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""*  **Scottie Pippen**  &gt;*""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""*  **Kevin Love**  &gt;*""MVP. He's my MVP.""*  **Z-Bo** after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  &gt;*""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""*  **Mike D'Antoni**  &gt;*""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""*  **Frank Vogel**  &gt;*""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""*  **Charles Barkley**  &gt;*""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""*  **Mike Breen**  &gt;*""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""*  **Jeff Van Gundy**  *""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""*  **Scott Skiles**  &gt;*""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""*  **Stan Van Gundy**  &gt;*""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""*  **Doc Rivers**  &gt;*""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""*  **Phil Jackson**  &gt;*""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""*  **Gregg Popovich**  &gt;*""I‚Äôm not even being politically correct, normally guys say I‚Äôm giving it to LeBron but honestly I‚Äôll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he‚Äôs on right now, he‚Äôs got my vote if I was part of the committee.""*  **Juwan Howard**  &gt;*""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He‚Äôs playing, well, like he‚Äôs the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He‚Äôs the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""*  **Chris Bosh**  &gt;*""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""*  **Lebron** when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;*""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""*  **Brian Scalabrine**  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"I know there's a lot of noise in these numbers, but both the Magic and the Heat got outscored when Dwight and Lebron sat that year, while the Bulls still outscored their opponents without Rose.  * Rose On: +10.1, Off: +7.4, On-Off: +2.7 * LeBron On: +4.6, Off -4.3, On-Off: +9 * Dwight On: +6.2, Off -2.7, On-Off +8.8  This would suggest that the Bulls were pretty competent even without Boozer and Noah.  LeBron was statistically better than Rose in:  * PER * Win Shares * Win Shares per 48 Minutes * Box Plus/Minus * VORP  Rose led Howard in BPM and VORP, but Howard had the other three.  Literally every available statistic indicates that LeBron was better than Rose, and most of them say Howard was as well.  Rose had a great season, but that was a narrative-driven MVP."
Why question is who is the a-rod of basketball? dwight howard?
"And Dwight Howard was 2nd in MVP voting. Lebron was 3rd. So for people who are still butt hurt about it, Lebron wouldn‚Äôt have won anyways if Rose didn‚Äôt."
Saying that Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are all-stars is like saying the Lakers had all-stars Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard last year.  By this logic DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are all-stars for the Nets and they have 5 all-stars.
"Other than 2000 what other ones   01 pau gasol, Zach Randolph, Tont Parker, Joe Johnson, tyson chandler, Richard Jefferson, gerald wallace     02 yao ming, amare stoudemire, caron butler, nene, tayshaun prince, John salmons, Mike Dunleavy    03 is obvious    04 Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, lol deng, andre igouldala, Devin Harris, al Jefferson, Jr Smith, Josh Smith, Tony Allen    05 Cp3, Deron Williams Andrew Bynum, Andrew bogut, Danny granger, David Lee, gerald Green, nate Robinson    06 Rondo, Lowry, Aldridge, Brandon Roy, Jr Reddick, rudy gay"
"Pat bev, Dwight howard, Clint Capela, montrezl Harrell, Trevor ariza, and Micheal Beasley all of these players are solid and better than almost any respective player on the warriors roster"
"not in the name of Lebron, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving, and Lamarcus Aldridge"
"Dwight Howard didn't play half that year.  Main teammates were: Ariza, Motiejunas, Brewer  Joey Dorsey started 17 games"
"Embiid, Hakeem, Shaq, Dwight Howard etc"
Dwight Howard
When the Dwight Howard drama was going down in Orlando one of the things the media talked about a lot was how much he smiled on the court and how coaches and players wished he ‚Äútook the game more seriously‚Äù
That Dwight Howard ptsd
Refs get paid a half a million a year to miss that dwight howard travel call
"When the refs go through points of emphasis over the off-season one of the bullet points must just say ""Dwight Howard."""
Embiid and Dwight Howard
"&gt; and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%  My claim above is that this is due to a greater percentage of free throws being shot by perimeter players.  The increase in FT shooting accuracy occurs precisely as league-wide 3PA skyrockets starting in 2016-2017 after Curry makes 400 3s in a season on the best team offense in league history.  It is certainly not driven by a handful of low volume big men like Drummond or Jordan figuring out how to shoot FT at a somewhat serviceable level.  And for every Drummond or Jordan there are plenty of players like Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, Giannis Anteteokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, even Russell Westbrook or LeBron James, who are marginal-to-bad free throw shooters but don't appear to have gotten any of the benefits of 'modern coaching'.  It's certainly possible that Shaq might have taken that coaching and benefitted from it -- shooting FT at 75% would have easily made him the greatest peak player in league history -- but it's far from a given.  &gt; There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left   There was only one in Shaq's era as well -- Shaq!  [In the year he won MVP there was only 1 other sub 60% FT shooter in the top 100 players by FT attempts -- Jason Caffey at 59%.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FTA&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=1999-00&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)"
So you weren't calling Dwight Howard gay to poke fun at him? I would love for you to explain the joke to me.
"Top 3 were Lebron, Kobe, and Wade. Howard was 4th. Dwight was good but had too many weaknesses in his game to be over Wade."
"But Seth is [questionable](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-tobias-harris-seth-curry-dwight-howard-questionable-warriors).  C'mon basketball, Gods. Give us the sibling rivalry matchup we need."
"Top 3? Bitch wade is not better Than Lebron, Kobe or Dwight fucking Howard.  Top 5 yes but hell nah on top 3."
"Yeah, you were insinuating that Dwight Howard uses Grindr, a dating app for gay men. Don't be obtuse."
"It‚Äôs probably true. A lot of Simmons fans argue that he‚Äôs ‚Äújust making the right play‚Äù with his non-shooting. But I would argue that to get better at shooting you gotta at least try in game. And there‚Äôs a pretty obvious balance to strike, he probably shouldn‚Äôt shoot in the playoffs but what is the harm in using a 30 point blowout vs the hornets or something as time to practice but he doesn‚Äôt even do that. Even Dwight Howard and Javale McGee practice threes during blowouts lol"
Donatas Montiejunas and Dwight Howard
"Well I wasn‚Äôt trying to sound insensitive, I‚Äôm just curious, as there are many fathers who played in the NBA (e.g. Dwight Howard, Karl Malone) who are/were not close to their children.  And according to Wikipedia, Pippen &amp; the mother of Antron got divorced after just two years back in 1990, so I think it‚Äôs a reasonable question to ask, especially considering the wording he used."
"I'd say Harden is up there, playing with Westbrook/Durant, then playing with Dwight Howard, then Chris Paul, then Westbrook again, then Durant and Irving. He's pretty much always needed a superstar pairing for his team to be relevant. Just like basically all superstars, except maybe Kawhi in 2019 and Dirk in 2011."
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
"His offensive ceiling would be like if you averaged out Dwight Howard and Nikola Jokic. Elite athleticism and build but not a dominant force like Howard. Good isolation scoring potential, so in the middle between Howard and Jokic. Already a way better shooter than Howard, but I‚Äôd be shocked if he was ever at Jokic‚Äôs level there. Not a defensive menace like Howard, but still elite there. His passing is great but not game breaking.  Its weird to compare a player by averaging two completely opposed players, but I think it‚Äôs the only way I can really describe Bam‚Äôs potential. As for statline I‚Äôd say a likely prime statline would be like 20/12/6 with 2 blocks."
"Yes. Based on Jimmy's interview w/ JJ Reddick, he seemed to have a problem with the head coach more than anything, followed by the FO. So if he got along w/Doc and felt appreciated by Morey et al, he'd probably do well. Ben Simmons said that Doc has been great about stressing ***accountability***, which seems to be Jimmy's language. Also Dwight Howard is the Udonis Haslem of the team (the vet capable of helping teammates climb another gear) a role Jimmy appreciates. Plus Jimmy and Embiid are tight."
&gt;Harden+ All Star Dwight Howard  Remember when Harden and Dwight Howard got eliminated in the first round by the lower seed Blazers? Didn't even mention that in my post. Defending Harden's playoff legacy is a losing proposition. Stop wasting your time.
&gt;Harden+ All Star Dwight Howard  im dead lmao.  You typed all that while completely ignoring the difference in rosters as if steph did it all himself.   weird that he cant make the playoffs this year if it was such a solo effort
The GOAT Dwight Howard leading techs
Worked with the Lakers and and the Dwight Howard comeback. üëÄ
Dwight ‚Äú3 fouls in 28 secs‚Äù Howard
"How do you count players on an all time team? Like kobe bryant, magic johnson, shaq, kareem, wilt, karl malone, lebron, davis, nash, pau, dwight howard?"
"Clippers. The 6ers would have *absurd* interior defense, and their bigs aren't particularly lumbering either so they can go out on the perimeter, but that Clippers team just has too much of everything. The scoring, floor spacing, defense, and IQ are all of the charts. Rondo is one of the best passers/floor generals of all time, regularly averaging double digit assists back in his prime and he was also a good defender. Prime Ibaka was a shot-blocking savant. Prime Boogie isn't even that far removed, so people should know what he's capable of. Prime Batum was a swiss army knife.   Clippers get upgrades at every position outside of their main duo. They're currently posting the best ORtg of all time right now, so just imagine how lethal the offense is going to be when you've got a younger Rondo and a prime fucking Boogie, lmao. The sixers get an upgraded Dwight Howard but that's pretty much it. Embiid is who he is, so is Ben Simmons, Danny Green hasn't really changed his whole career so him being in his prime doesn't change anything, and Tobias Harris is already currently having his 2nd best scoring season PPG-wise and his best season efficiency-wise."
before he came back to win the championship last year it was probably Dwight Howard
Okay Dwight Howard
"Lol this is a Lebron team, he just straight up won't be allowed to have those high volume/poor efficiency nights with Bron/AD on the floor. Sure, he won't get 15 FGA in the playoffs, but the looks he does get will probably look closer to this, than his down DET/CLE games.   Dwight Howard went from 57 TS% in Charlotte, to come to the Lakers and post a 70% TS%. It was the lowest usage &amp; highest efficiency season of his career - which was by design. So seeing Drummond integrating with a new team, while coming off an injury is definitely promising with Lebron/AD on the way"
~~Lebron got JR Smith?? Lol imagine thinking this will work~~   ~~Lebron got Dwight Howard?? Lol imagine thinking this will work~~   ~~Lebron got KCP?? Lol imagine thinking this will work~~   Lebron got Andre Drummond? Lol imagine thinking this will work
He's one of those players that is just big without even trying. At least with Dwight Howard and those type of players it looks like they put a lot of time in the gym. Drummond is just big for no reason lol.
Rather Dwight Howard
"Pretty solid list. To add to it, looking at half decades:   PG:   * 80-85: Magic Johnson * 85-90: Magic Johnson * 90-95: John Stockton * 95-00: Gary Payton * 00-05: Jason Kidd * 05-10: Steve Nash * 10-15: Chris Paul * 15-20: Steph Curry  SG:   * 80-85: George Gervin * 85-90: Michael Jordan * 90-95: Michael Jordan * 95-00: Michael Jordan * 00-05: Tracy McGrady * 05-10: Kobe Bryant * 10-15: Kobe Bryant * 15-20: James Harden  SF:   * 80-85: Larry Bird * 85-90: Larry Bird * 90-95: Scottie Pippen * 95-00: Grant Hill * 00-05: Paul Pierce * 05-10: LeBron James * 10-15: LeBron James * 15-20: LeBron James  PF:   * 80-85: honestly real hard, all the great players were either a SF or C. I guess Kevin McHale * 85-90: Charles Barkley * 90-95: Karl Malone * 95-00: Karl Malone * 00-05: Tim Duncan * 05-10: Dirk Nowitzki * 10-15: Blake Griffin * 15-20: Anthony Davis  C:   * 80-85: Moses Malone * 85-90: Hakeem Olajuwon * 90-95: Hakeem Olajuwon * 95-00: Shaq * 00-05: Shaq * 05-10: Tim Duncan (at this point he had moved to center almost exclusively) * 10-15: Dwight Howard * 15-20: Nikola Jokic  In total, players with 3+: MJ and LeBron, players with 2: Duncan, Hakeem, Shaq, Bird, Kobe, Magic."
"Man Dwight Howard carried a team to the NBA Finals, I love Noel and Robinson but there is no comparison here"
"When u think about it it makes sense cause of how many centers are in the league that kinda do the same thing as each other. Off the top of my head u have Noel, Robinson, Dwight Howard,  Isaiah Stewart, Jarret Allen, Jakob Poetl, etc. Obviously some of these players are way better on offense or defense than some of the other players but for the most part they have the same role and all are pretty good at it"
"Lol calm down dude you don‚Äôt need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
Dwight Howard has entered the chat
"We played today without Tobias Harris, George Hill, Seth Curry, or Dwight Howard."
Wait- does Dwight Howard have an air plant on his head?
"And if it makes you feel any better, both Dwight Howard and Josh Smith completely dad dicked my AAU team multiple times two decades ago. I still remember how embarrassing those games were."
Dwight Howard Game 6 vs Cleveland
"Iverson is better, Kyrie never carried a team to the Finals  Pelicans are young and have had spacing issues, Celtics have been struck with covid/injuries all season  Kuzma is not world class (and he's on the Lakers), Dwight Howard is not world class (and he is super divisive from when he  used to be world class), Westbrook just has haters because people don't think he deserved MVP, Simmons I actually don't know, Kelly Oubre is not world class"
"Curry's shooting %s have been up and down this year, started off blazing but regressed after getting covid. But he's basically what I gather he's always been.  Danny green shooting is insanely hot. Good team defender.  Tobias is playing really well. Consistently scoring, esp at the ends of games. His defense has solidified. Still passes up open 3s at times.  Thybulle has gotten better, picks his spots better. Shooting is still super iffy.  Korkmaz has been good lately. Defense is improved and shot is falling. When his shot is falling he's a playoff rotation player.  Shake has scoring pop off the bench. Not quite the 6MOY level we were hoping for and his shooting has  been down this year, but a necessary player.  Dwight Howard has been a decent backup, except the insane number of offensive fouls he collects. He and Simmons cannot play together tho, the numbers are awful and will only get worse in the playoffs.  Mike Scott's shooting is off, and he doesnt do much else so he looks awful.  George Hill is a theoretical being"
Dwight howard
The Harden/Dwight Howard teams with Kevin McHale coaching weren't very good.
"I mean, [Dwight got a non-guaranteed contract on purpose to help him stay motivated.](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/12/7/21000390/lakers-rumors-dwight-howard-non-guaranteed-contract-free-agency-news-stats-analysis-jump-ramona)   But yeah, he's really turned himself around."
Dwight Howard is probably the worst best center in the NBA. Remember when him and LeBron were competing for MVP? Good times.
That Dwight Howard ‚Äúdefense‚Äù clip with the reporter after the game was hilarious tho ngl
"Yes, not by a lot but better. People forget that prime Dwight Howard anchored a top 3 defensive team with a starting 5 of Hedo Turkoglu, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis. The only real good defenders he had were Keith Bogans, Courtney Lee, Mickael Pietrus who played larger minutes.   Yes, SVG had some really good defensive schemes of tunnelling everyone to the paint and using Dwight, but Dwight carried those Magic teams both offensively and defensively.   If I had to describe the real difference of Gobert and Howard is that Gobert uses his length to scare the offensive players, and Howard used his speed and strength. There was a sense of safety with Howard that you could somehow get through him, and then he exploded to block you or contest the shot. Young Dwight didn‚Äôt really had any weaknesses as a defensive player, he could defend anyone 1 on 1, and he had both the speed and quickness to defend anyone in 2 vs 2 situation.   The problem why Dwight declined so heavily wasn‚Äôt just the injuries, but his laziness and lack of on the spot BBIQ. When Dwight had to think for himself and not just play in the SVG system he really struggled to find his place, and the best defensive position."
"Shaq was one of the greatest players of all time during his era and he quickly fell off, so did Dwight Howard (obviously not as good as shaq or curry) Heck even boogie was seen as one of the best of his time got injured and how he goes from team to team.  Obviously none are as good as Steph but injuries especially on old people can fuck careers.  So to assume he might of taken a back seat and only had a idk 24/3/6 season is really fair and trae is currently having a decent season that if curry had taken a backseat which would have been understandable then yes trae would be the better player for that season"
"This would hold up if we were talking about 1 or 2 people, you are saying there are 3 individuals better than anyone on the Lakers. Not to mention the Sixers are also rolling out Dwight Howard, Danny Green and Tobias Harris to round out their rotation.   The only negative defenders in their top 8 rotation are Seth Curry and Shake Milton, both guards."
"Embiid for sure. He‚Äôs flirting with some of that Steph/Dame magic this year ‚Äî [this still might be the most insane play I‚Äôve ever seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mvudpg/highlight_embiid_almost_ties_the_game_with_a_full/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Thybulle has been a pleasant surprise ‚Äî he certainly demands a lot of attention.  As for players not on the Sixers, I might have to go with Giannis. The fact that he‚Äôs taking so many 3s now rules. He shoots like Dwight Howard, but he makes a lot of them! He‚Äôs just so big and good lol"
"You're saying Dwight Howard is shooting 60% from 3 this year, on high volume."
Sign me up. I‚Äôd love to bring back Nerlens but bring me the great Dwight Howard if Nerlens gets a big bag elsewhere that king Leon Rose doesn‚Äôt want to match

"He would play that defense when he upped his intensity. Especially showed up in the playoffs as he'd be so effective and disruptive to guys like Tim Duncan, both Gasol brothers, Klay Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Dwight Howard, etc. It's really flourished ever since his last year with the Clippers then on to the Pistons and now the Nets, he plays so physical and with a high motor that just frustrates guys."
"10 blocks could be prime Dwight Howard sidelines seat blocks. As if he's saying, ""Try Again.""  Extra possession for opponents."
"Then ya dont get it friend. Basketball is a numbers and a skill game. When coaching defense, you want the opposing team to take the worst likely shot they can take.  That would be... Dwight Howard for three."
"[""Dwight Howard contributes pretty much nothing for the Sixers all season lol""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n7a6qe/game_thread_new_orleans_pelicans_3036/gxc7d5v/) - u/whatsgoinonhere190"
"Chandler was great that year, but he wasn't a better defensive player than Dwight Howard. It's also one of the few times the DPOTY wasn't on the all defensive 1st team. I think same thing with Gasol the next year. I feel like it's used as a cop-out, like mvp and offensive player of the year in the NFL."
No it isnt lolol. Any team worth their salt in the NBA will gladly lose to Dwight Howard taking 3s
I think most Laker fans that watched the team last year were annoyed that Dwight and the Lakers had the miscommunication at the start of free agency.  Dwight was a key backup center and his defensive IQ really helped anchor the defense. It allowed us to have a strong defense even when AD was on the bench.  It also gave us crazy lineups against teams with bigs like Denver since Howard could be played next to AD which gave us monster defensive lineups like Caruso Green Lebron AD Dwight (pretty much everyone being super high Defensive IQ).
Lakers fan Lurking in a Dwight Howard thread.  Obviously reminiscing about the good ole days.üòÇü§£
All I‚Äôm here to do is remind you that ESPN made a graphic at the beginning of the season showing Dwight Howard starting at PF alongside Embiid at C
At the time Gasol and Harrell seemed like an upgrade over Howard and McGee and Morey getting Howard seemed like a weird move. Nobody could've predicted the Lakers dropping like flies and Dwight becoming the People's Champ in Philly
Masai got greedier than Dwight Howard at the 3 point line
That‚Äôs Dwight ‚Äú100% from 3 in the NBA finals‚Äù Howard
Who needs Dwight Howard when you can have legendary Andre Drummond
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford"
"&gt;  I mean a great look at the rim over a weak defender.  And....who would that be?  The only weak defender who will get any minutes will be Seth Curry, and you can expect he'll get fewer minutes in this matchup.  You're talking about ""weak"" defenders when the Sixers are running:  Embiid, Simmons, Danny Green, Thybulle, Harris.  Those guys are all somewhere from good to elite on defense, and their backup center is Dwight Howard.  The rim is untouchable and the switchable, long defenders will be contesting 3's."
"Nah, Wiggins played like Wiggins always does, Jimmy did underperform, but still was the best player for the Timberwolves in that series.  KAT on other hand was absolute hot garbage, he made Clint Capela look like prime Dwight Howard and was the main reason why the Timberwolves got blown off the building by Houston. KAT has the skills to be the best big man in the league, especially on offense, but he is soft, that's why Jimmy doesn't respect him.  Kinda crazy how much of a polar opposite that KAT is to KG, who is the guy that he was supposed to succeed in Minnesota, both extremely skilled as big men, but one is soft like charmin and the other was a crazy maniac."
"Nobody was calling him a top 5 player tho. He was easily one of the most hated players in the league, was thought of as having a shitty attitude, broke the all-time single season turnover record, and was clowned on for his defense more than any other point in his career (not to mention winning Shaqtin MVP)  His chemistry issues with Dwight Howard added to his negative public image, as well as the fact that he got McHale fired right after a WCF appearance"
Big dopey idiot's still have great defensive numbers! Look at Mark Eaton and Dwight Howard!  Give me a better argument you halfwit
&gt;KAT is such a loveable person   Yeah... don't be that.     On-court killers HAAATE sweet and soft big men.     Remember Kobe calling Dwight Howard soft? Remember Jordan punching Longley?
"This. They play BB not compete for mister OLYMPIA. yes it helps if you are fast and can jump high but in my book that doesnt make you a good BB player.   I rather have Team with Luka, Jokiƒç, than team with, RW and Dwight Howard and we all know that RW is 10 times more athletic than Luka and DH is 10 times more athletic than Jokiƒá."
"Damn.  Seeing Lakers fans this dejected makes me kind of sad for some reason.  You guys JUST won a chip and you've got LeBron/AD heading into the playoffs.  Haven't seen Lakers fans this down in the dumps since the first Dwight Howard ""era"" in LA."
"&gt; Lakers best thing to do is try to bring Dwight back next year.  Rondo and Howard were the most important players they had behind AD/Lebron. Even if healthy, they will miss them sorely."
"First, I appreciate that you're more intelligent and taking this more seriously than the  casuals -- the type who think that anyone who makes out MJ to be anything less than the GOAT (or worse, anyone they disagree with) is dumb; and that only box stats and team wins should determine MVPs.  With that said...  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Isn't Jokic pretty much leading most of the ""Metrics"" tho? I'm not trying to get into an argument, I'm legit wondering which metrics you would use to say someone else deserves it. He has a nearly 3 point lead over everyone in BBRef +/-He has big leads in Win Shares, Win Shares Per 48, PER, and VORP. Along with RAPTOR  Since I apparently wasn't clear enough, when I implicated +/- metrics over box stats, I was including advanced metrics that predominantly rely on box stats.  VORP, 'Win Shares' proper, and PER are based on box stats.    I forget about RAPTOR's reliance on box stats, but it's mostly a trash stat based on research I vaguely recall from a couple years ago.  For instance, it had Chris Paul with the best +/- of all time, as of a couple years ago; and last season going in the playoffs it had the Lakers with one of the lesser championship odds, the Rockets as the best, and the Lakers as low as 2% when they were down a game to the Rockets.  I'm open to some deep analysis that finds some value in the stat, but right now I ignore it entirely.  PER isn't that good even accounting that it relies on box stats.  BPM/VORP is basically the better version.  PER is historically significant in sort of being the grandfather of advanced metrics, just now it's worthless.  BPM/VORP is the best metric I'm aware of that's based on box stats.  Win Shares proper I've also come to ignore completely.  WSp48 last season would've suggested that Dwight Howard and JaVale were about as good as LeBron.  I don't think I need to go on.  Where are you getting BBRef +/- Jokic being in front of everyone figure?  I have the site in front of me and can't find it.  Here are the stats I have in mind why Jokic shouldn't be MVP:  * ""On-Off"" based on BBRef's seasonal rankings, under ""+/- Per 100 Poss."" This is good for comparing a player to the rest of his team, and not just raw +/- which is heavily influenced by teammates.  Not accounting for minutes played, Jokic is currently sitting at 44th in on/off per 100m.  Accounting for mins and p100p, Gobert's the field's leader, and it isn't close.   * WINS, which is RPM in accumulative form.  Jokic currently 3rd with 14.41 (RPM of 4.87).  Gobert is slightly ahead with 14.85, and Curry's easily #1 with 17.76.  RPM is black boxy about its methodology, but I've read before that on-off is a strong component of it, and spending some time looking over playing ratings over various teams and season, know in advance roughly where a player should fall, none of their ratings are way off and it isn't biased toward high volume shooters that so many metrics are, so it seems to be one of the best advanced metrics IMO."
Dwight Howard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Drummond
Dwight Howard contributes pretty much nothing for the Sixers all season lol
"Chris Paul, Westbrook, and Dwight Howard"
"Eh I mean they still got Dwight Howard who's a big time playoff vet, George Hill, Danny Green"
People had all the same complaints about Dwight Howard last year. Then in the playoffs he was super valuable against Denver. Same thing will happen with Drummond.   Fans don't value old school bigs who can't shoot 3s. But they are still valuable in the playoffs.
Ok but the guy I replied to was taking about Dwight Howard
"Lebron wasn't even second in mvp voting, Dwight Howard was."
The disrespect to Dwight lol.  Howard made the finals as by far the best player on his team.  Drummond has never made the playoffs as his teams best player
"When does he play as the 4, when Dwight Howard is on the court with him"
If he played how current Dwight Howard played he‚Äôd be really good. But he plays like he‚Äôs Jokic. So he‚Äôs terrible
Dwight Howard loves transvestites and getting bit on the butt Marv Albert style.
"There was a really old thread on the magic realgm forums (like 10+ years old now) that was ranking all magic players ever and Dwight was the consensus number 1. Dwight Howard was still on that team and before he hurt his back so the recency bias was huge there and the fact that Shaq left the team and Dwight yet hadn't. I am sure if you asked who was better between KD and Westbrook shortly after KD left, many Thunder fans would rate Westbrook the best player. Just a reminder on bias."
Dwight Howard never learned how to hit against the shift.
"Yeah, Shaq does have something against Dwight Howard. It‚Äôs weird cause I‚Äôve honestly never personally known anyone who refers to him (shaq) as Superman.    It‚Äôs not like George Gervin being mad if someone else is called iceman. Or Julius Erving over Dr J. But barely anyone calls shaq by the nickname he gave to himself."
Anthony Davis got spanked by Dwight Howard when he was on the lakers
"Man, I forget where he was at the time, but your 2019 squad with the Dwight Howard you have now (or maybe the mindset he has now but more of his athleticism of 2019)  You guys would have been crazy back then!!   edit: I forget who you guys had to lean on back then...Greg Monroe???"
Rivers decided to experiment with embiid and Dwight Howard out on the court together for a chunk of minutes in a game earlier this year. Safe to say that experiment ended quickly
He rolls like Dwight Howard in his prime.
So did Dwight Howard
"And that‚Äôs why, Dwight Howard&gt;Bill Russell"
"I wanna push back a little bit on this idea that most important always means best. During those Magic runs, I think it‚Äôs accurate to say Dwight Howard was the most important player to his team out of anyone in the league. The team lived and died by what he did. They had talent around him but if he wasn‚Äôt doing his thing the whole team fell apart. Whereas a guy like Kobe, important as he was to the Lakers at the time, if he had an off night or missed a game they could get his points from Pau and Lamar and Bynum and D Fish and Ariza and Lamar could pick up his slack defensively. But to argue that Dwight was better than Kobe at the time was and is preposterous.  I agree with you on the topic of KD and Curry/Harden, just think it‚Äôs wrong to say most important = best."
Dwight Howard has 3 DPOYs.  Bill Russell has 0.
Dwight Howard did
"Correct, there was a time when the rockets were no1 seed and both harden and clint were on the mvp ladder ranks. They should be part of the discussion, dwight howard was part of the discussion on the 09 magic too"
Dwight Howard seems pretty dumb.
Dwight Howard counted out loud and then our bench started counting out loud last time we played the bucks
"HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.  ""What if Dwight Howard jumped over him and he kissed the bride?""  I'd never seen this before. I had no idea my life was so empty."
"Or he might not have the talent level to improve on things like ball handling, finishing and shooting to elevate him to star player status. People kept saying the same thing about Dwight Howard, but sometimes a player just doesn't have that feel for the game, touch and coordination to improve all their technical deficiencies. I think if anything, Wiggins basketball IQ should be questioned more than his motivation or work-ethic."
IIRC Dwight Howard had a stretch where he was repeatedly called for it. Players started counting out loud while lined up waiting for the shot attempt.
"I love watching Dwight Howard get his 8pts, 8reb and 8 loose ball fouls per game haha"
Last time I‚Äôve ever seen that called was against Dwight Howard in like 2009
Dwight Howard
"Dwight howard even though he was ""washed"" late-career dwight when I saw him  That man is just enormous"
"Dwight Howard did this 3 times in one season, including back to back games down the stretch of the year that got him to 18 techs on the season and earned him a one game suspension"
Dwight Howard is soft.
Shout outs to Dwight Howard in Orlando getting called for this many times.
They‚Äôve enforced it against Dwight Howard before
Dwight Howard did that in on of their games this year. If Dwight's complains about how slow your free throws are you know you have a problem
Better question is Drummond or Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard once shot like 50ft just so the lakers could get into the playoffs. I might‚Äôve been dreaming or high I don‚Äôt know but I just go with it.
Dwight Howard got called for it
Dwight Howard would like a word with you
They used to get Dwight Howard all the time lol
Maybe our last playoff series is why im not salty about this and just fond it funny he gets away with it when pour Dwight Howard got called for it in his prime.It used to be fun seeing a new video of Dwight getting called for a 10 sec every other week.
"I legitimately can only think of 1 time in my 20+ years of watching basketball when I've seen it called, against Dwight Howard back in like.... 2009? He was still on the Magic, I remember that much."
Because most players don't go over and when they do it's by a small amount.   They'll only call it if it's egregious or if someone starts complaining. One of my favorite plays is when it happened to [Dwight Howard](https://youtu.be/8T8uRmwP1jE) and you can see Paul Pierce counting the seconds.
"What? OP raised the idea of Zion with Draymond level of defence.  Zion is in his second season and if he continues to develop on this trajectory, could become one of the most dominant offensive forces in the games history. I would say Shaq type of output is not unreasonable for his offensive ceiling - top 10-12 all time.  Even if he doesnt develop any further, he could probably have a Charles Barkley type of career - good for top 20-30 all time.  Now if you add Draymond Green level of defence to either of those guys? Barkley becomes top 10, and Shaq could have an argument for GOAT. I dont think that is a particularly hot take.  Dwight Howard makes no sense for this conversation. Zions offensive game is leagues above what Howard ever showed. Unless you were changing it to Howard with Zion's offensive game (or Shaq's offensive game) - and then that is more in line with what I am suggesting."
"If you guys had your way, every Tom, Dick and Harry would be in GOAT conversation.  C‚Äômon man. By your ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù Dwight Howard is in the GOAT conversation then ?"
*Dwight Howard has entered the chat*
"I fixed the formatting for you lol. Looks like a good list to me, but I would have KAJ for the Lakers, maybe Wilt for GSW, maybe Dame for Portland, and I think Dr. J is the right choice for Philly, but AI makes it close.     Atlanta Hawks: Dominique Wilkins   Boston Celtics: Bill Russell ( a tough one tbh)   Brooklyn Nets: Julius Erving   Charlotte Hornets: Kenna Walker   Chicago Bulls: Michael Jordan (obvious)   Cleveland Cavaliers: LeBron James (no brainer)   Dallas Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki   Denver Nuggets: Alex English   Detroit Pistons: Isiah Thomas   Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry   Houston Rockets: Hakeem Olajuwon   Indiana Pacers: Reggie Miller   Los Angeles Clippers: Bob McAdoo   Los Angeles Lakers: Kobe Bryant (SUPER TOUGH)   Memphis Grizzlies: Zach Randolph (tougher than it seems   Miami Heat: Dwyane Wade   Milwaukee Bucks: Kareem Abdul Jabbar   Minnesota Timberwolves: Kevin Garnett   New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans: Chris Paul   New York Knicks: Patrick Ewing   Oklahoma City Thunder: Russell Westbrook   Orlando Magic: Dwight Howard   Philadelphia 76ers: Julius Erving   Phoenix Suns: Steve Nash   Portland Trail Blazers: Clyde Drexler   Sacramento Kings: Oscar Robertson   San Antonio Spurs: Tim Duncan (easy choice)   Toronto Raptors: Kyle Lowry   Utah Jazz: Karl Malone   Washington Wizards: Wes Unseld"
It should be Dwight Howard.
"&gt;I see you posting this everywhere.Drummond was okay in single coverage. Gasol was much better.  Gasol was not better at all, and for only about 1/3rd as many minutes as Drummond.  &gt; Drummond has zero ability to play out of the post, with bron gone that means the team has very poor playmaking.    Watch the games.  Drummond has more than zero ability in the post.  You are being completely ridiculous.  &gt; Drummond isn't a very good lob threat or even average I might say .   Same is true of Jokic.  Not everyone has to be a lob threat.  &gt; Pray tell why you think Drummond was better than the stat line suggests   Since you've read my other comments, you should have already seen me explain this repeatedly.  Since you apparently don't read very well, here it is again.  How, exactly, did Denver have their worst offensive night of the season?  Because Jokic could not score efficiently against Drummond one-on-one for \~20 minutes, and the Lakers did not have to double him -- which other teams are forced to do, and which allows Jokic to find open teammates for easy baskets.  That's the same model the Lakers used in the playoffs last year, with Dwight Howard as the primary defender on Jokic and a few minutes of McGee."
I don‚Äôt think the stat would be that valuable. Finding PJ Tucker in the corner is a much more efficient pass than finding Dwight Howard. Adjusting to the league average shooting doesn‚Äôt account for the extra defensive attention good shooters or finishers will get off ball. It‚Äôs going to be more difficult to find Klay a shot than Oubre.
Because of the double-doubles people had the perception he could be a Dwight Howard type player. In reality he's more close to a Kevon Looney or Javale Mcgee.
"About to drop some knowledge on you from a different thread, please hold:  I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I‚Äôm not even being politically correct, normally guys say I‚Äôm giving it to LeBron but honestly I‚Äôll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he‚Äôs on right now, he‚Äôs got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He‚Äôs playing, well, like he‚Äôs the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He‚Äôs the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
It‚Äôs similar to the Dwight Howard/Harrell minutes in the playoffs last year.
Philly not a maybe. Dwight Howard by himself is meant to bother and foul Jokic as much as possible when they meet up
This is actually a fairly common occurance. Shout out to Grizzlies legends Dwight Howard and Dion Waiters.
No more than 5 million. I mean Dwight Howard makes the minimum lol
2015 Warriors: beat a James Harden led Rockets team who's second best player was a declining Dwight Howard   2021 Sixers: need to beat a team that has 3 superstars and might be the greatest offensive team of all time.   Also the sixers don't have the depht that the Warriors had. Horrible comparison
Shoutout to the great Dwight Howard as well. Best backup they‚Äôve ever had for Embiid by far.
Or Dwight Howard
prime dwight howard?
Love D Rose but Dwight Howard deserved MVP that season in my opinion. It was still good to see him win it though
 I will admit fashion wise I am pretty disappointed in the NBA jersey changes the past 8 years. The Lakers left their early 2000's future Lakers yellow gold the ones Kobe Wore most of his career although the classic yellow is fine I don't like the purple black sides rendition I preffered past early 2000's road purple. The Orlando Magic not using those good jerseys Dwight Howard 2009 Magic anymore sucks. However the Cavs 2017- to now is a good jersey. Overall the Suns lost that cool Steve Nash mid 2000's Suns Jerseys very upsetting to lose that great jersey. Detroit and Milwaukee recent jerseys are the worst awful I wish they had their early 2010's jerseys. I don't know about those purple road Raptors Jerseys this season kinda not as cool as the late 1990's Raps Jerseys. Overall my team the Kings have good jerseys in recent years. Utah with the sunset Jersey they should switch to their retro 1990's instead. I really hope teams stay cool looking like the early 2000's jerseys cause the 76ers changed theirs too much too should have kept their 2019 ones..
Anyone want to guess who the other player besides Luka to have 16 techs is?  None other than sportsman of the year Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard also went to the 76ers this year.
I‚Äôm living in an alternate reality but the call was against Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard &gt; Paul Pierce
Dwight Howard is a 5 and Tobias Harris is a 4
"His hometown where he's basically treated like a god, there's basically nothing but bad blood for Josh Smith and Dwight Howard, Lou's the only hometown hero from that era to have nothing but love from the locals"
Suprised no one has mentioned Dwight Howard. Would have also had the added benefit removing some of his primary competition in the east
Dwight Howard
Luka made Powell look like prime Dwight Howard against the Lakers so it's not hard to imagine how the actual D12 would fare with the Don.
"Remember when Southwest Atlanta Christian would have pickup games at the school and their alumni would show up, Dwight Howard, JJ Hickson, and Javaris Crittendon being the most popular of course. Dwight was hella childish, turning the lights off while we were changing, tapping people on the shoulder and running to the other side, etc. He was like 25 going on 13. Not saying he was a bad person, just kind of annoying."
Dwight Howard is a hall of famer so yes lol
Most teams in contention with a prime Dwight Howard would be favorites   So yea
Not with Lebron and AD Prine D12 was good but at the end of the day they can shoot a any prime big man out the game. I was a huge Dwight Howard fan when I was younger I really think he would of been better in Orlando for longer.
Yes but in the case of a person who is taller than everyone in the league besides his bench teammate and Tacko Tall... All you do is   1. Catch ball 2. Hold ball tightly as you turn towards basket 3. Shoot however shitty of a jump hook is necessary to get off unbelievably easy shot against anybody  Even Dwight ‚Äúnever cane close to his offensive potential‚Äù Howard learned a fucking shitty jump hook JFC
"They wanted to start pj tucker at center and they badly needed a wing defender who would make up for no defense from harden and Westbrook. And cutting salary didn't hurt either.  I agree w your point. Look at the team w the best big man in the league - they protected him with Dwight Howard, McGee, Marc gasol, Montreal Harrell, and now Drummond."
tatum built like Dwight Howard + AD
"Grayson Allen, Dwight Howard, Austin Rivers, a decent amount of players hate Rondo.   Jimmy Butler hates a good amount of players üòÇ"
Didn't Dwight Howard do something similar a few years ago?
Draymond Green and *maybe* Lakers Dwight Howard only because the refs let him hack the fuck out of Jokic with impunity.
is just like last play-off when Jokic guarded by Dwight Howard. I feel ex-DPOY veteran are Jokic kryptonite
Possibly 5 if you include Dwight Howard and Antawn Jamison
lol thats not dwight howard bro. its andre drummond
Remember when Rondo was silently counting out the seconds it took for Dwight Howard to shoot a FT?
Dwight Howard would have clamped Ayton
"This is long, but somehow it also didn't feel *too* long. As opposed to when Dwight Howard took over 10 seconds it felt like a lifetime"
I miss Dwight Howard and Javale McGee
Dwight Howard to Andre Drummond?
Multi time all-star Dwight Howard and a Curry swap. Final offer
Are there any other players that have consistently slow free throw releases? I feel like Dwight Howard got critiqued for the exact same thing
"Yes, you were. He‚Äôs no Dwight Howard."
"Younger people forget but LeBron was capable of playing great defense on Dwight Howard, a center who was an MVP candidate, and Derrick Rose, a point guard who won MVP, both in their primes. There are very few players in NBA history who could do a good job defensively on both the league's best point guard and center."
I wanna see this with Dwight Howard or Montrezl
"Yea there‚Äôs always a good bunch of stars coming up.  People forget we just had Lebron, Curry, Harden, KD, Westbrook as young players. They‚Äôre still great.  Before that it was Shaq, Kobe, Nash, Duncan, Nowitzki, KG, Paul Pierce, prime Dwight Howard.  League always finds young stars. Will always be a few that look like they‚Äôre gonna be good for a while."
Rodman was an over glorified role player....who worked as a journeyman in the league because his game wasn‚Äôt worth the baggage he lugged around with it.  Maybe the equivalent of Dwight Howard for the sixers. Ben is a franchise cornerstone and the sixers wouldn‚Äôt be half the team they are without him.
"Wilt, Kareem, Russell, and ‚Äúarguably‚Äù Olajuwon, yes. The rest in their prime, no way.  Plus, Dwight Howard? JC, man."
Shaq Wilt Kareem Hakeem Bill Russell David Robinson Moses Malone Patrick Ewing Dwight Howard are all light years ahead of him
"I dunno man. It‚Äôs hit and miss in both eras. Plus that‚Äôs really just recency bias. I go down the list and know most of them cause I watched basketball then.  3s in 2000s - Harden, Horford, Derron Williams, Ben Gordon, Melo, Pau Gasol  There were a lot of misses at # 2 tho. Gotta give you that. Besides Durant it‚Äôs a lot of nothing. Same up until 2015 really. That 2 pick is fucking rough.  And some of the 1 picks flamed out. Kwame Brown, Greg Oden, Bargnani.   But the good 1 picks you still had Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Yao Ming, Lebron and Kenyon Martin wasn‚Äôt bad.   A few of the ones we think are good now from the late 2010s will inevitably get injured in the next 3-4 years and flame out too. Happens to a lot of players. Then we‚Äôll have the same ‚Äúwho was that guy‚Äù posts in 2030 because they only had 3-5 decent seasons."

"So you want one team to have prime Shaq, Dwight Howard, AND Giannis...and the other team doesn‚Äôt have a center? A in 4 unless the ref just calls it early"
"Looks like some of the same guys out there, unless you think dwight Howard was the heart of the team"
2 way contract a la Dwight Howard. Needs to redeem himself after a bunch of misfit years. Totally plausible.
And George Hill and Dwight Howard. Hands everywhere.
Wizards legend Dwight Howard
can i see another dwight howard
i love dwight howard
"Even with Dwight Howard on the floor, the Sixers all bench lineups are occasionally hilariously bad at rebounding. They look like a Three Stooges sketch with the confusion and the heads whipping around trying to track the ball."
Dwight Howard has entered the chat
Dwight Howard joined the chat.
Add Dwight Howard and TJ McConnell
"Prime Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons on the same team means you're bombing away from three every single game, good luck not being able to hit a layup doing that.  Second round of the playoffs or better, depends on whose going to hit shots on offense."
Prime Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons would not work on offense in today's NBA.
Embiid pre injury was #1 pick material and probably still as good as he was in his original rookie debut maybe better. Combined with Dwight Howard that team would be seen the same way imo because they would still be a tier below the Nets.
Dwight Howard has entered the chat.
***Dwight Howard has entered the chat***
Drummond isn‚Äôt really a better version of Howard/McGee.   He is an elite rebounder but doesn‚Äôt have near the defensive IQ of Dwight
Yeah but that took finesse. It‚Äôd be like if Deandre Jordan had faced up Dwight Howard and hit him with that move.
Dwight Howard noises
Dwight Howard
This. Random though - what if you had a Dwight Howard as your back up big  Waving towels - energy - support - positive love of the bench   They have the analytical Rondo - but no heart and soul no ego let‚Äôs have fun guy
Yeah Paul George is basically the new Dwight Howard. Left a small market that loved him and hasn‚Äôt been the same since.
So uh. LeBron and AD look pretty healthy. Major chemistry issues. Gasol is unplayable though. They would be so much better off with Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard
"For what it's worth I think Giannis *should* play Center but the spacing on the Bucks is good enough with Lopez where it's not as necessary. Meanwhile the Lakers have had JaVale McGee, Dwight Howard, and Andre freakin Drummond as your centers alongside AD which are considerable downgrades in fit"
"Last year against Houston Vogel started Javale in Game 2 as well. He started him in the second half of Game 2 and again in Game 3, but he was never seen again after that 1st shift in Game 3. Dwight Howard played his usual shifts in Game 1, but sat for the rest of the series (until garbage time in Game 5). Vogel knows what he's doing."

Also Dwight Howard iirc
Yeah immature clown Dwight Howard who put on a whole dog and pony show for a season and ruined his reputation.
"He developed Dwight Howard pretty well though, best of his career. No reason to think he couldn‚Äôt do it with Zion"
Danny green former champion was a big part of that too defensively. He was a great help defender. Also Dwight Howard a former multiple defensive player of the year and hall of famer . While maybe on offense they can be overlooked they did a lot of little things defensively I feel like we are missing. Mainly communication and knowing your role to a point that your rotations are happening in sync with the opponent.
"The point is no one is forcing their way out of the current contract to play with anyone except these 4 because they‚Äôre the only ones that have proven they can win  I saw a thread earlier where a quoted Bob Meyers said they had players that wanted to come to Golden State, but as soon as Klay went down it just didn‚Äôt happen, so maybe in this case it was 2 stars  But there‚Äôs a reason Harden forced his way out to play in Brooklyn, or AD did to play in LA, Blake, LMA and Drummond all were bought out to play in those 2 places too. I mentioned it in OP but same with the bigger name free agents to those 2 + Clippers. Nobody has bought out their contract to play in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Utah, Phoenix, Denver, Dallas. All those places have young guys who haven‚Äôt proven they can win yet.  Harden did mention PHI was one of his preferred destinations and they did get Dwight Howard in free agency who helped the Lakers win last year, so maybe Embiid is that next guy up that can draw the same kind of stars or ring chasing vets if they win this year"
Dwight Howard isn‚Äôt a fair comparison. That dude shoulders are farther apart than my eyebrows and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll ever change
"I can add to your list  AI, Mcgrady, kidd, dwight howard, dwade"
&gt;  they aren't juicing like baseball players did to hit the ball farther  idk i imagine they're just better at using PEDs now. like you cannot look at vintage dwight howard and tell me he wasn't on the gas.
I remember Paul pierce snitching and doing a countdown to get Dwight Howard called for the violation
Compazzo is the Dwight Howard of Point Guards
Why stop liking good players. Looking at you dwight howard
"Hopefully, not aloof like we thought Dwight Howard was."
"Not only that, he was a rim protector at 6 foot four. Blocking guys like Dwight Howard, Brook Lopez, Tim Duncan. Pretty crazy to think about"
Would Dwight Howard be a decent fit for this team? He‚Äôs available in the off-season and he only commands like 2.5mil. Splurge on the extra .5 mil and you have a decent 1-2-3 of big men in Looney-Dwight-Wiseman. Could even get some twin tower shit going at some point.
Jokic‚Äôs only issue was racking up a shit ton of fouls because he let Dwight Howard get in his head
"Not too sure about versatility. Howard is obviously more mobile than Gasol and Drummond, but he saw fewer minutes in the Heat series because they continued to target him through switches and what not. Gasol and Drummond just made this problem significantly worse, but Dwight Howard wasn‚Äôt the one that was necessarily going to fix it."
"I couldn't find one that wasn't potato quality, but...  [CP3 dunking on young Dwight Howard is a fucking classic] (https://youtu.be/7yHdl4e6HEc)"
"Because on paper, he fills the same role as Dwight Howard and Javale McGee. A huge defensive presence that can rebound like a motherfucker.  Problem is he wants to play like he's the centerpiece of the front court. He's slower than molasses and has to stay in and around the paint to be affected.   Howard / McGee had such quick feet that could cover more of the floor more effectively and since they weren't scorers that made room for Davis."
He'll get there eventually. Took Dwight Howard 10 years to win without the great Jameer Nelson.
"Yeah exactly, you guys will be fine once Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard and Danny Green hit their straps."
Terrible coaching job by the Lakers. Vogel has been around this team for two years. He should know his players. Rotations are absolutely embarrassing. He should know Drummond is unplayable. Much worse than Javele McGee and Dwight Howard. Yet he CONTINUES to play Drummond. He needs to tighten up the rotation. Limit it to 8-9 players. If we do that we will be alright. It was always a 10 pt deficit. We could never really cut into it and it never really got out of hand. As long as we stop playing Drummond and limit Shroeder and Kuzma we are going to be fine. But it comes down to the fucking coaching.
Alex Len or Drummond?  Tony Bradley or Drummond?  Dwight Howard (lol) or Drummond?
Really missing Dwight Howard tbh
Lakers are missing Dwight Howard dearly
"They just need Drummond to be Dwight Howard 2.0  That's all you need to do Drummond, rebound and play hustle defense lol"

Embiid: +9 in 10 mins   Dwight: -10 in 14 mins      Howard a decent backup but I don't want him playing 15+ minutes in a playoff game. Ig thats what happens when Embiid gets called for soft fouls
Prime Dwight Howard was soo good
Dwight Howard hof easily
dwight howard is the king of and-ones
Yo. Dwight Howard is the Busta Rhymes of the NBA. The older they get the more angry and brutish they become.
Dwight Howard is a walking illegal screen
How the hell you confuse Shake Milton with Dwight Howard?
"Yeah, on 2nd thought he probably meant Dwight Howard. That makes more sense lol."
You are thinking of Dwight Howard
"I think you're talking about Dwight Howard, not shake lmao."
"just wondering, is dwight howard the best bench center in the league? cos i cant think of a better one then him"
"Hawks legend, Dwight Howard showing out against his former team"
Why does Dwight Howard look like the Angelica doll from rugrats bruh?
Dwight Howard and the old school game.
*Everyone watching Dwight Howard*‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúShhhh be very quiet he‚Äôs about to do something stupid‚Äù
Hawks legend Dwight Howard a future 2 time champ!
Good to see Dwight Howard is still rocking the Sour Gummy Worms
"Are you kidding me? The eastern conference from 2008 to 2018 was literally one of the weakest conferences of all time if you exclude Lebron... The only notable team was the Big 3 Celtics who got injured and was aging terribly by the time Lebron joined the Heat. There was a Hawks team that got #1 seed lead by Paul Millsap ffs. That shows just how strong that conference was.   The 80's had mountains more competition specifically in the eastern conference against Bird. Now if you want to argue the West had weak competition outside of obviously the Lakers and at times Houston, Spurs and Nuggets in the 80s sure but the East in the 80's was fucking stacked. Lebron had to deal with Dwight Howard once and it gave his team problems. Imagine 5 other teams with Dwight Howard and Boston Big 3 like competition or better, leaving you with less chances to dodge that competition in the playoffs.   &gt; LeBron was also doing it in a far more competitive and complete league Bird had no argument at the time.  GTFO here."
Man dwight Howard isn‚Äôt the player he used to be but he‚Äôs such a good depth big
"Thybulle, Korkmaz, Maxey, George Hill, Shake Milton and Dwight Howard is ""no bench"" in your opinion?"
He's got those Dwight Howard shoulders.
"For people who didn't see that last Jazz-Sixers game, it was so, so fun:  * UTA 92 - PHI 86 in the 4th quarter, Dwight Howard (?!) hits a big 3 with Gobert on him * UTA 118 - PHI 115 12s left in the 4th quarter, Embiid ties the game by catching the ball near the elbow, almost losing it, then dribbling out to the 3pt line, pump faking bojan who contests, then hitting the 3 with bojan's hand in his face * Sixers win OT 131 - 123"
"He would be amazing. This is why I think it is wrong when people say the bigman is dead. The bigman was dead for a while just because there wasn't any good bigmen in the league. If Dwight Howard didn't exist, people would have been saying the bigman is dead in the late 2000's after Yao Ming injury. The bigman got good again when good bigmen entered the league like Joel Embiid, Giannis, Jokic, Gobert, and Bam."
The venn diagram of perennial 3pt snipers and LA finals series enders is just a circle. It‚Äôs Ron Artest and Dwight Howard.
team B is literally the kd warriors with prime dwight howard
Dwight Howard strokes 3s in practice all day   These NBA players are just on another level
Dwight Howard is the main one that comes to mind.  He has come close in the past to getting the automatic suspension for having too many flagrants in one season.  Dwight and Embiid have [7 flagrants](https://scores.nbcsports.com/nba/leaders.asp?year=&amp;type=Totals&amp;rank=055) between them this season.
That‚Äôs a bit extreme lol I don‚Äôt think the Magic have won a playoff series since Dwight Howard was there that‚Äôs well over a decade. Wouldn‚Äôt happen on Masai Ujiri‚Äôs watch.
Dwight Howard does this every second he is on the floor.
"2010 Magic  Jason Williams, JJ Redick, Dwight Howard, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkolu, Vince Carter, Ryan Anderson"
The Dwight Howard special.
"So Dwight Howard has GOAT level defense accolades, so he should be able to ‚Äúshut down‚Äù Jokic and Embiid right if he was tasked with guarding them. Murray would make this series go 6 games imo, with Suns winning"
"Bro nah.   Prime CP could pull up from 18 feet, dunk on Dwight Howard, and lock up the best guard on the other team.  Prime CP3 almost won an MVP over prime Kobe."
Dwight Howard was crucified in 2012 when he got ejected before a sweep. Jokic deserves that same criticism
"People need to understand that refs have a certain criteria they use to determine which level of flagrant foul it is. It didn't look that bad, but that doesn't mean they're able to stray from the rule book.  Intent, wind up, contact to the neck-and-up region, and follow-through is going to get you a flagrant 2 every time.    I personally don't like it and I'd love to see them have the ability to make more of a judgement call, but that's not how the rules are written.  Also, if that was Dwight Howard or one of the Morris twins, nobody would be questioning the ejection."
No. And Dwight Howard would be banned for the rest of the playoffs
Why should him being mvp matter? I'd Dwight Howard did that he would be banned for the playoffs
I seriously think Russell and wilt can be pushed out of the top ten. I think they were special players in a not so special league. Very important to the history of the league but they can't have been much better than prime Dwight Howard you know?
They gonna be worse next year. Unless they sign Dwight Howard
"Damn, you completely didn't understand what I wrote. Harden never beat a team better than his in Houston and lost twice to teams worse than his. Luka has lost twice, both to teams better than his. lmao. I don't believe you honestly think the Mavericks were better either year than the clippers.  &gt;Harden took G leaguers to a top 4 seed in the west.  Man, people sure like to look at the 2013-2014 Rockets and forget that in the Portland series the best rockets player was Dwight Howard.   Dwight Howard had his last vintage performance while Harden was chucking shit."
"Chris Paul, Dwight Howard wanted to come to Houston. Westbrook requested a trade to Houston two years ago.  Bosh and Melo also wanted to come to Houston but it fell through   Feel like Houston would‚Äôve had better luck if they weren‚Äôt so capped out every year with bad contracts."
He could've joined the Sixers and been a sold backup PF along with Dwight Howard.
"&gt;he wanted Dwight Howard to come and run Pick and Roll. Howard instead wanted to post up and put up his own empty stats, intentionally fuck up screens before getting injured and missing a shitload of games.     Exactly. James Harden wanted him and the front office got him. That he didn't work out exactly the way Harden wanted him to is not on Morey. Plus, Nash had the exact same problem with Dwight in LA. Why did Harden think he'd be any different in Houston?   &gt;yes, and they almost won the chip when he was healthy. but then his hamstring went, he played horribly, and he kept barking at everyone even though he was shooting 30% from the field and cost them a series.     Again, how is this on the front office? Chris Paul has one bad series and Harden decides he's had enough of him? Why couldn't they work out their issues and run it back?   &gt;I don't understand this on a couple of levels. The role players he played with weren't elite. Harden made them LOOK elite on occassion, but under Moreyball the whole idea is that roleplayers switch on defense and they shoot 3s. Which elite roleplayers shot even 40% from 3? They just shot a lot of them all on the back of Harden's drive and kick game - which many, many teams do. 3&amp;D isn't just a Harden thing.     Capela was an excellent roll man and rim protector. PJ Tucker and Ariza were great switch defenders and a big part of the reason why the Warriors were forced to go into KD-iso mode for that series. Eric Gordon provided a great scoring punch off the bench and was a more than capable defender. If you want to critique their shooting percentages in that series, you also can't ignore the fact that Harden's TS% was 54%.   I'm sorry but if you want wing players who provide that level of effort on D and can also shoot 40% from 3, you're gonna have to pay a lot more than the 7-8 million. The Rockets probably wouldn't have been able to afford CP3 then.  &gt;not when they were supposed to be serious about winning a title. they had plenty of moves to make to solidify those teams with CP3. Tillman didn't want to pay tax and he didn't want to give up picks to fortify the team until Harden threatened to leave; which is why they attached picks to CP3 to get WB - it was a desperate move, rather than using those same picks to get actual elite roleplayers to play with them in 2018 and 2019.     But they were serious about winning a title, which is why they went to the conference finals twice in a loaded conference, won about 7 playoff series and posted 5 50-win seasons in the 8 seasons he was there. Morey made the best moves possible. His whole philosophy has always been to get the best player on the market. That's why they made the trade for Westbrook. Do you think that if he had been more stingy with his first round picks, Harden would've been more inclined to stay? Or that they would've traded for Chris Paul in the first place?   Fertitta definitely could've and should've been more willing to go into the tax but that's an ownership problem. The front office did everything they could've for Harden. They really valued his input and made plenty of personnel decisions based off of it, which is more than you can say of a lot of franchise players. Given how involved he was in that process, don't you think he should be held more accountable for their perceived failures, especially for not patching things up with Chris Paul?"
Giannis reminds me of Prime Dwight Howard in that they have no moves at all.
"I hated Dwight Howard getting the ""Superman"" nickname only because Shaq had it before him. Also, DWade's self-anointed nickname ""WoW"" was cringey, especially because ""Flash"" is such a sick nickname"
"&gt; He wanted Dwight Howard, they gave him Dwight Howard  he wanted Dwight Howard to come and run Pick and Roll. Howard instead wanted to post up and put up his own empty stats, intentionally fuck up screens before getting injured and missing a shitload of games.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;He wanted a superstar sidekick, they went out and got Chris Paul.  yes, and they almost won the chip when he was healthy. but then his hamstring went, he played horribly, and he kept barking at everyone even though he was shooting 30% from the field and cost them a series.     &gt;It's true that he didn't play with a lot of bona fide superstars but the role players they surrounded him with were elite and complemented his game perfectly. The whole Moreyball scheme was tailored around his strengths.  I don't understand this on a couple of levels. The role players he played with weren't elite. Harden made them LOOK elite on occassion, but under Moreyball the whole idea is that roleplayers switch on defense and they shoot 3s. Which elite roleplayers shot even 40% from 3? They just shot a lot of them all on the back of Harden's drive and kick game - which many, many teams do. 3&amp;D isn't just a Harden thing.      &gt;This is a terrible example of a team mistreating their cornerstone player.  not when they were supposed to be serious about winning a title. they had plenty of moves to make to solidify those teams with CP3. Tillman didn't want to pay tax and he didn't want to give up picks to fortify the team until Harden threatened to leave; which is why they attached picks to CP3 to get WB - it was a desperate move, rather than using those same picks to get actual elite roleplayers to play with them in 2018 and 2019.   &amp;#x200B;  Like, for years everyone would talk about how washed guys like Dwight and WB were.. but then when it comes to Harden, he's supposed to be thrilled to have them as his only ""star"" backup lmao"
"Harden was very involved in all of the Rockets' front office moves. He wanted Dwight Howard, they gave him Dwight Howard. He wanted a superstar sidekick, they went out and got Chris Paul. When he decided he didn't like playing with Chris Paul anymore, they reunited him with his childhood friend and former teammate. It's true that he didn't play with a lot of bona fide superstars but the role players they surrounded him with were elite and complemented his game perfectly. The whole Moreyball scheme was tailored around his strengths. And finally, when he decided he wanted out, they traded him to his preferred destination, even though they probably had a better offer on the table from another team. This is a terrible example of a team mistreating their cornerstone player.   If every superstar player had full control over where they want to play, there would only be 3-4 legitimate title contenders every year. That's why the NFL is more popular than the NBA. There's a lot more parity, very few repeat Super Bowl finalists."
No. I‚Äôm not. How many games will Joel miss? Dwight didn‚Äôt in his Orlando years. How many DPOY for Howard? How many finals appearances?
"Forreal. Bad owners don't  deserve blind loyalty  from players. I'd feel bad if organizations actually tried to win and their guys left, but Houston wasted so many years of Harden because he was a guaranteed playoff berth no matter what.  &amp;#x200B;  People love to act like they did him a favor by getting him Dwight fucking Howard and Russell Westbrook, but the only championship team they put around him was 2018 and even then they had moves to make with the Ryan Anderson contract. They could've attached the picks they used to get WB to that contract in 2018 and gotten a legitimately good player to play alongside him and CP3. Instead, they kept it all and Ryan Anderson collected DNPs against the Warriors.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd rather see elite players go deep in the playoffs than be stuck with shitty orgs."
"2011 dwight Howard, mainly because he can stay healthy Back then people were saying he can guard to players at once, and he still got his just by virtue of how athletic he was. https://youtu.be/fGjdKQPz9uo"
Like Dwight Howard did during the Kobe years.
That‚Äôs why Dwight Howard is so beloved
Dwight Howard being accused of being a seven foot bottom by a transsexual was pretty wild.
Remember when Dwight Howard had that weird accusation against him that seemed like extortion?
"I miss having games all day during the summer and all of the 'bubble content' like team golf trips, JR smith rants, Dwight Howard at the pool, etc. It really was a once-in-a-lifetime NBA reality show and a bright spot during an extremely rough year. But I'll never miss not having fans again."

Dwight Howard. Bynum was perpetually injured and eventually became a non factor. Iggy and Howard dipped after a year. Vuc was nice but the magic was stuck in purgatory. However the sixers could be argued to win the trade as it started the process
Nah what you mean is Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard deal was a cluster fuck

"I like this one. I think LMA, Melo, and Dwight Howard are all in the same tier   I think Pierce is slightly above them"
"Dwight ""Maple"" Howard"
"Can someone answer a question for me? According to NBA.com, the 76er's Ben Simmons has a free throw percentage of 35.4% this season (which is making Dwight Howard look good). Why isn't Atlanta fouling him?"
Nah Dwight Howard would be Shaq
"Because he is n athlete and not very skilled.. there are many players like that and media tends to hype them up.. ben simmons will never become a superstar. Media once called draymond green a superstar..the reality is nba is a skill based league..those guys will never be superstars and with time the reality will set in.. look at once perennial allstars dwight howard, drummond... they wont"
"&gt;LeBron turned him into a spot up 3 point shooter   I'm fairly certain Love's weight loss factored a lot in his change of play. Love was barely able to post up Shooting Guards when he was in the Cavs.    &gt;The truth is that LeBron needs a specific roster to play with  I mean, I'm gonna have to disagree with this. If you mean in terms of making a run at the championship, then yeah I think so too (Lebron works best when around shooters and/or another off-ball competent star). But that's true for any player because building around your star is the norm. E.g. You want shooters around Dwight Howard, Giannis, Shaq (if he was in today's game)  But if you mean just relative success like making the playoffs and being kind of competitive, LeBron is one of the best floor raisers ever (he's the best IMO). First stint and 2018 Cavs are a great example of this. And to an extent the 2019 Lakers are too, since they were in the 6-8 seed range before LeBron's groin injury, and by the time he came back his teammate's were the ones suffering injuries   But I do agree Chris Paul is a lot easier to inject in a team"

It's Dwight fucking Howard aka point god
Dwight howard/javale mcgee. He'll sit beside shaq. Lol.
"Meanwhile, Dwight Howard is torching the league at 100% from 3 in the finals"
"Someone mentioned in the danny green injury thread that Jae Crowder and Dwight Howard are the only ones from last years finals that are still in the playoffs without being plagued by injuries after a very short offseason. KCP, DG, Bron, and AD all got injured during or right before the playoff."
The post-prime Dwight Howard special
"When I stop to think about it, it blows my mind that Dwight Howard and George Hill are role players on the Sixers....dudes were top tier, especially Dwight, and now they are so proper in playing their roles as bench guys. Tremendous culture"
"He went from 16 ppg his rookie year to 18 ppg his sophomore year so everyone was expecting at least 20ppg but he instead dipped to 14ppg. Chris Paul runs a really slow paced offense and the team was winning so on one hand people were forgiving but on another it is a tough pill to swallow. Ayton scored 14ppg when all the other great 22 y/o bigman like Giannis, AD, Embiid, Dwight Howard, Shaq, Tim Duncan etc etc all scored at least 20ppg by then and there was a hope Ayton would be a bigtime scorer in NBA consider he was a 20/11 guy with 65% TS in college."
"The interesting years are when the top pick would change depending on the team picking. If a team other than Orlando got the first pick in 2004, Emeka Okafor might have gotten drafted before Dwight Howard. Conversely, Kevin Durant might've gone before Greg Oden for certain teams, which would have put another bust in the #2 column."
Who knew 35 yr old Dwight Howard would be so damn great as a backup!? /s
Dwight Howard was the Al Horford we were promised
He ain't the Orlando magic version but pretty sure the Lakers regret letting Dwight Howard walk away.  Solid minutes and still has a little of the old version in him.
"I turned on the game and immediately thought to myself ""what is Abe from oddworld doing running around the court?"" Then said oh shit that's Dwight Howard."

"Dwight ""Checkers"" Howard"
"&gt;I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not ‚Äúcheap‚Äù  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn‚Äôt the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn‚Äôt he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren‚Äôt cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren‚Äôt exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don‚Äôt have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don‚Äôt have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don‚Äôt trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don‚Äôt know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I‚Äôll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there‚Äôs a high chance of us bringing back. So you‚Äôre talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that‚Äôs 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you‚Äôre in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that‚Äôs fine.   Now I don‚Äôt even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we‚Äôre talking about the Lakers."
MORE DWIGHT HOWARD!!
Hawks are really getting it handed to them by Philly's deadly guard/big combo of Furkan Korkmaz and Dwight Howard.
We're getting beat by 142 year old Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard = Chris Andersen
Dwight Howard is tall
It's great to have Hawks legend Dwight Howard on the court.
Dwight Howard is still in the NBA ‚ùì
I mean Dwight Howard was skinny when he was drafted and he built into one of the biggest dudes there is. NBA strength and conditioning will get him there.
"He played fine defense, there was a dedicated spot for centers, Dwight Howard fucked up his back, and Roy Hibbert was underrated because he played in Indy."
Fucking Dwight Howard loves that shit..
"Jrue Holiday got injured in January ffs His team made the playoffs without him that's no excuse at all.   Mike Conley missed game one. They had him when they were up 2-1. Games 4,5,6 he averaged 11 points on less than 40% TS.  Dwight Howard played 35 mpg and played ever game in that series."
"Add Tony Allen, Dwight Howard playing with a bad back after missing half the season and rushing to get play in the playoffs,"
They kinda screwed themselves with that one in the end when Asik became the 3rd highest paid player on a team with Dwight Howard starting at center.
"The biggest thing Shaq probably doesn‚Äôt think of as skill was his ‚Äúshooters touch‚Äù around the basket. For a freak athlete of his size and quickness to have that was insane. It is a more simple style though as he often says - just jump hook em to death. His conditioning was an issue on the tail end of his Lakers career though. It is one of the reasons Kobe didn‚Äôt get along with him because he literally played his way into shape to start the season a lot. In a way, it shows how insane he was to be able to do that but that was why his decline was so quick. If he had taken care of himself in the offseason ala Dwight Howard he wouldn‚Äôt have dropped off as much as fast. I‚Äôve always thought that was the reason he hates on Howard so much because he knows that‚Äôs a regret of his."
"Common man. The Cavs looked dominant in the regular season, but they still had flaws. Apart from Lebron and Delonte West, nobody on the team could create their own shot to save their lives.   Mo Williams was at most a 5th option on a legit contender and the Cavs were depending on him to be the second star on offense. Regular season basketball is very different from the playoffs.   We see how role players efficiency usually go down the drain in tight and physical playoff games.   We just saw it happen with Joe Harris. Ben Wallace was out of his prime, Big Z was slow as hell, they both got dominated by Dwight Howard. The refs actually did everything to help the Cavs by calling soft fouls on Howard lol. This way when he was out of the game, it helped Lebron get to the basket easier and Wallace could rest his old bones.   Verajao is just an energy guy. There to set picks and rebound, he is a liability everywhere else. The Magic were a match-up nightmare. Turkoglu was roided up and playing like Magic Johnson.   Completely controlling the games and carving the Cavs defense up. Pietrus, Reddick, Rashad Lewis were all more talented than the role players for the Cavs and better shooters too."
"Lebron was def the most talented, but not the best. Wade, CP3, Kobe, Dwight Howard and Carmelo had legit arguments. Dirk was still a monster in 2009. Lebron took his defensive game to a new level in 08/09 season which made him a better overall player, but he still had glaring flaws in his game. 2021 version of Giannis is perfect representation of what Lebron was around that time. Giannis is already a 2-time MVP and DPOY award winner and nobody would say he is definitely the best player in the world. He is top 5, but some other players are still more skilled and complete."
Rudy Fernandez. Dude dunked on Prime Dwight Howard in 2008 gold medal game‚Äô
"As an engineer, it's the prime example of of why stats aren't the end all be all. The best analytics aren't those who can create a graph or databank but those who can put them in context. As somebody who played basketball throughout his teenage years, I can 100% anecdotally confirm I've seen, been and witnessed hot streaks same as cold streaks. For example a 40% of threes while a good indicator of made shots won't determine the single next independent shot you take (alot of factors go into a  shot, which can't be broken down into a single number) it's why Dwight Howard reportedly shoots 80% from the line in practice yet not even close in game, it's why curry can go 100/100 from the corner in practice but won't on wide open shoots from the same spot in game. Hot hands, beeing clutch, hell even the meme of intangibles do exist and every one who played the game can see when someone has IT despite not knowing what IT is."
"One of their main reasons for losing '09 was Mo Williams. I remember up until the Magic series, he was seen as LeBron's best teammate ever and was the ideal Bron teammate, going as far as to make the all-star team. Then he just folded in the Orlando series.Didn't help that the Cavs had 6'3"" Delonte West guarding Hedo for the most part, and nobody could guard Dwight Howard. For a time, Dwight was seen as the anti-LeBron because he was the only superstar who was bigger and just as athletic as LeBron, and whose elite rim-protection was enough to slow LBJ down"
"That's when everyone was on steriods. Everyone looked like Dwight Howard and was covered in tattoos from head to toe...this is when the league wanted to go away from ""thug ball"" and look for a more suburban star. Steph Curry and the Freedom of Movement begin."
Dwight Howard
"Lowry currently has an ~85% chance of making the HoF according to bball-ref. Which would give him the 11th highest chance of active players.  Lebron, KD, Chris Paul, Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis and Carmelo are basically locks. (All higher than 98%)  Then Dame is next at 90%  Then Lowry. And he will still add to his legacy and stats, so I'm assuming it's going to be a lock.  (Paul George, Kyrie, and Kawhi are the next 3, all above 77%)"
"Super team, no, it wasn't a super team era, but in that time Kobe had more help than the other contending stars, except maybe Boston.  For each of the years 08, 09, and 10, Kobe had more help than Duncan, Nash, Dirk, Carmello, LeBron, Dwight Howard, etc.  Only Boston was comparable, and I would argue that the Lakers without Kobe beat the Celtics without Garnet (Lakers without Kobe lose to the Celtics without Pierce, so Garnet is the #1)."
"He cheated on her, and then immediately left her and married the girl he cheated on her with so he could take care of his kid. Yeah cheating is bad, let's not act like vast amounts of players cheat and sleep around. Dwight Howard has kids by many different woman and cheated but no one cares.  People just dislike Paul George and want to sit on some moral high ground about his personal actions. He actually ended up marrying that ""stripper"".   I know y'all think strippers are subhumans but he could've not married her and just let the kid be raised by a single mother like most."
"00-03 Kobe is phenomenal on defense, gaining a reputation for that in a way only Jordan matched.  So, yeah Tim Duncan was better on D but that's a bit unfair, Kobe as a guard would be compared to his guard peers. And... Kobe was better on D in that time than his peers of Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, AI, Antawn Jamison, Tmac, etc. So, that's an apple and an orange.  Also, for a couple of years one would argue Ben Wallace, KG and Dwight Howard were as good or better on D as Duncan was at the big man spot. Not to mention in 1998-99 you could make the case for Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo, David Robinson as being better than Duncan. So again, with Duncan it's never as clear cut as you think.  Meanwhile on offense, you can't really make the case that there was ever a 2 guard better than Kobe, outside Wade in 2006, maybe, and then post 2010. Compared to his peers Kobe was just head and shoulders better."
Seem to be called plenty when the alleged violators are Ben Simmons and/or Dwight Howard.
They only call them on Dwight Howard.  But they're called techs.
"Some of it definitely was, especially all the ""Dwight is gay and fucks trans people"" stuff. It was prevalent on this sub, as well as NBA Twitter (which this sub pretends to be better than).

Dirk my favorite player of all time. If I found out he cheated on his wife I‚Äôd lose a ton of respect for him even if it has nothing to do with basketball"
Hi I'm Dwight Howard and I would like to examine
"I'm not saying PG is Chris Paul or Tim Duncan but they're both guys that only had a couple actually healthy years before they lost a TON of their explosiveness. the kids these days probably don't even realize Chris Paul postered the shit out of Dwight Howard. Duncan was way more athletic in the 90s before he fucked up his knee, too, just like Chris.   just goes to show great players are great players, and they find a way to make it work. Pat Ewing's prime was at Georgetown, before he even got to the NBA because his mobility went to shit. still found a way."
Psh the magic have  Jameer Nelson   Vince Carter  Hero turkoglu  Rashard Lewis   Dwight Howard.   Wait‚Ä¶
Center minutes on the last five NBA championship teams  2020 Lakers: JaVale McGee / Dwight Howard (16.6 / 18.9 mpg)  2019 Raptors: Serge Ibaka / Marc Gasol (27.2 / 24.9 mpg)  2018 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee / Jordan Bell (14.1 / 9.5 / 14.2 mpg)  2017 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee (18.1 / 9.6 mpg)  2016 Cavaliers: Tristan Thompson / Timofey Mozgov (27.7 / 17.4 mpg)
He reminds me a bit of the impact Dwight Howard had last year.
"&gt;how come that hasn't happened every other time we've had players throw fits, demand to be traded, and refuse to play or say they were injured?  Generally players in recent years who have requested trades have been pretty polite about it. Mostly they don't throw fits or say they were injured  AD asked for a trade but wanted to keep playing for the Pelicans, they were the ones that wanted to keep him.   Harden asked for a trade but was happy to keep playing (at least at first), and then while he started getting annoyed on the court he kept playing. That was also because the Rockets were trying to convince him to stay  PG asked for a trade in the off-season, but the Thunder seemed happy with that  Butler did throw a fit and demanded out with the TWolves, and apparently did refuse to play once. But I'm pretty sure he kept playing even as things got pretty openly hostile, the Wolves also spent a lot of time trying to convince him to stick around  Carmelo Anthony with the Nuggets he wanted out but he kept playing. It partially just took a minute to get a deal together  Dwight Howard with the Magic was just weird. He kept changing his mind, but I don't think he ever refused to play, and if I remember it right he was basically publicly on the fence about wanting out. He did eventually ask to go, and so they moved him  The only one I think that really fits the profile is Kawhi. And that was about injury which no one really knew what was going on, turns out he was hurt but also didn't want to play. They could have  fined him, but then that would just be doctors arguing with each other"
"Ayton plays too friendly sometimes‚Ä¶ He should be dominating the boards‚Ä¶ Could you imagine teams going small against Tim Duncan, Shaq, KG, Dwight Howard,Dirk‚Ä¶ Big men don‚Äôt have the fight in them anymore‚Ä¶ Allow Beverly to defend him in the paint? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Dwight Howard already does.
Dwight Howard used to do underhand halfcourt shots during warmups too. Good mems from the turn of the 2000s decade
They should demand Dwight Howard from the Sixers and get Wiggins back. They can bring Anthony Bennett out of ~~retirement~~ the Puerto Rican League too. And maybe they can get Blake Griffin as a free agent too.
"Because with his size and speed(cliche, I know? With a spaced floor he can basically get to the basket at will.   Think back to those Dwight Howard magic teams or a lot of Lebron teams. There was so much space that he can just basically charge right to the rim. A lot of the time Lebron doesn't even need a screen.   Obviously, the mentality doesn't cure everything, but it can most certainly drive him to get better."
Yeah his dismissiveness of the younger guys kinda makes sense when you think about the torch passing...     Russell/Wilt=&gt;Kareem.  Kareem=&gt; Hakeem.  Hakeem =&gt; Shaq.  Shaq =[ Dwight Howard.
The one which Dwight Howard kissed?
Yeah obviously in those two seasons only. Nobody talks about washed past their prime All Stars being the driver of team success.   You wouldn‚Äôt hear an NBA team saying they‚Äôre contenders because of Number 1 overall pick 8-time All-Star 3 time DPOY Dwight Howard lol Jermaine O‚ÄôNeil barely averaged 13PPG for the Heat.
I‚Äôd rather have Dwight Howard on a minimum

"[klix.ba] Dwight Howard: ""If Simmons is leaving Philadelphia, so am I."""
"I'm really baffled by Love. The team is already stocked with superior options at rangy forwards or small-ball centers, what it's missing is a large body. I'd literally have even someone like Dwight Howard, because then at least there would be a diversity in options."
"Penny, T-Mac, rashard Lewis, Dwight Howard, Shaq.  Bench has Steve Francis, grant hill, Horace grant, Tobias Harris, terkaglu"
"Yeah, but I‚Äôm not sure Ayton becomes a better overall player than even Dwight Howard, let alone reach the MVP level of actual champs like Shaq, Duncan/Robinson, and Olajuwon"
"He was the 3rd option even at his 3rd season. But of course a casual would not know this. Also, the Lakers wanted Dwight and the city even had billboards enticing him to re-sign. Even Kobe was in the meeting to convince him to stay. He left for Houston as a free agent and the Lakers got nothing.  ‚ÄúHoward declined a five-year, $118-million contract offer from the Lakers to accept a four-year, $88-million deal with the Rockets, his third team in an 11-month period.‚Äù  Of course a casual doesn‚Äôt know this. Disgusting. CP3 was in Houston for 2 seasons. Harden really choked against GSW. Also, Westbrook left him because he seems more focused on strip clubs than basketball. What‚Äôs underneath the beard is an L."
Dwight Howard since he left Houston.  Shoulda been an All Star in 2018 in Charlotte
Butler was never injured. Bam hurt himself but being a dumbass and trying to body up Dwight howard. And we were up 30 lmaooo
Ayton is a worse version of 2020 Dwight Howard
"He means that if you lose in the playoffs, you shouldn‚Äôt be court side watching another team play. It‚Äôs bad form. And of course it‚Äôs Dwight fucking Howard."
Dwight Howard was literally courtside for tonight's game
Dwight Howard was at the game tonight so that's def not true
Is Dwight Howard courtside?
"Shaq does this everywhere, in interviews and with everyone it's not an act  He gets defensive at everything, he still has beef with Dwight Howard because he called himself superman"
Is that Dwight Howard courtside?
Is Dwight Howard there?sitting behind the hawks basket?
Was that Dwight Howard sitting by the basket? I saw his French fry hair
Is that Dwight Howard?
Is that Dwight Howard? And who is that next to him?
Is that Dwight Howard sitting on the baseline? The blond dreads and pink shirt?
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
He could be elite when he wanted to but that was rare. He was particularly good when he was young and the second option. As the first option no.   He had a 0.3 DRPM in 2009 for example when he was 1st team all-defense. Compare to the other 1st team guys:  Chris Paul DRPM: 3.8  Kobe Bryant DRPM: 0.3  Lebron James DRPM: 3.7  Kevin Garnett DRPM: 3.0  Dwight Howard DRPM: 2.4  Dwyane Wade's DRPM that year was 2.4 but he didn't make 1st team all-defense. Wade rarely did and it was because Kobe unjustly always got selected.   This wasn't just a one year anomaly. Kobe's DRPM in years he made 1st team all-defense:  2004: 0.5  2006: 0.2  2007: **-.05**  2008: 0.6  2009: 0.3  2010: 0.2  2011: **-0.2**  Yeah he made 1st team all-defense even in years he had a negative DRPM.
Y‚Äôall see Dwight Howard is at this game lol
Dwight Howard as ball boy
I hope Dwight Howard is not planning to sign with the Hawks
Dwight Howard sighting. Front row. Cheering for Hawks. How embarrassing.
Was that Dwight Howard front row?
Did y‚Äôall see Dwight Howard in the crowd?? Makes sense cause he‚Äôs from Atlanta but it‚Äôs funny cause he lost to them
Is Dwight Howard sitting in the stands?
Is that Dwight Howard in the front row behind the Hawks basket?
Dwight Howard cameo.
Dwight howard in the crowd lol
Is that Dwight Howard in the crowd?
Dwight Howard sighting
is that Dwight Howard in the audience front row
Was that Dwight Howard courtside?!?
Why is Dwight Howard at the game
Haha fuck Dwight Howard and Hedu
"Collins........12.2 FGA/g.............4.2 FGA @0-3ft...........75.2% @0-3ft  Gobert.........8.2 FGA/g.............6.3 FGA @0-3ft...........79.9% @0-3ft  Ayton.........10.0 FGA/g.............5.3 FGA @0-3ft...........76.6% @0-3ft  Statistically Rudy is the most dominant around the rim of the 3, though Collins obviously has more offensive versatility and is younger with more room to grow as a player.  Ayton is also young and has room to grow.  Just pointing out that Rudy is perpetually underrated on offense.  He's not a monster offensive player but is a great asset to have on offense. Jazz just need 1 more consistent guy to help Mitchell on the perimeter.  Collins not sure he's worth the max, but they should match a max offer I think.  He's pretty close to that level and could still develop more.  Ayton is a no brainer max and I think will develop into a Dwight Howard type player and perhaps even better since he doesn't have the ego issues."
"If he could shoot 34% then that gives the Suns more flexibility in free agency at the very least. I.e. if they want to get a strong back up big who can play 20 minutes (either late career Lopez brother, Dwight howard, etc) then they have more rotations they can put them in since they could almost play as a PF on defense and use Ayton as a lite-stretch big and secondary rim threat with the defensive-oriented backup big. This focuses on comparative advantage and is a relatively small advantage but like potentially substantial. Worth some money on open market"
Dwight Howard. When he boxes out he swings his arms around like a madman
"Not that I'm estatic he doesn't wanna play center, but what do you think is going to happen if he runs into centers like Dwight Howard and Rudy Gobert? He knows his limits, especially when it comes to how his body feels after coming back from injury."
"Normally that's true (e.g. Dwight Howard hitting 3's and FT's in practice with ease), but Ben Simmons is a different story. Unless you think [this is too much pressure for him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_19QsYhuwzU)."
Sports fans act like every player is bad at stuff because they don‚Äôt try hard enough.   Dude Dwight Howard practiced free throws incessantly and never improved. Sometimes you‚Äôre just bad at something.
"physically maybe, but he doesnt play like drob offensively who played like a SF a lot of the time.  i'd say he's more like dwight howard.  prime nba athlete at center thats a beast on defense and can finish under the hoop and run the floor, but not necessarily a well developed offensive game."
"Nah, if the Knicks didn‚Äôt make the trade the Nets were going to instead.   Only reason the Nets traded for D.Will was because Melo fell through before their move to Brooklyn. Once the Nets went 12-70 missed out on John Wall and got the #3 pick (Derrick Favors) they realized they needed a ‚ÄúStar‚Äù player for their move to Brooklyn.   Nets had to deal with the ‚ÄúMelo-Drama‚Äù and then the ‚ÄúDwight-Mare‚Äù shortly after when Howard was forcing his way to Brooklyn only to back out at the last second because he felt bad on the team plane surrounded by everyone.    ‚ÄúDwight-Mare‚Äù led to the Nets in a panic sending an unprotected 1st in a shortened season to Portland to show D.Will they were willing to invest in the roster. That led to Portland drafting Lillard w/ the Nets pick.   Worst part of the whole D.Will era is the Nets were almost free from it in back in 2012.    D.Will was hesitant to sign his 5y/$98m extension and wanted to go home and play in Dallas all while training and rehabbing using the Brooklyn facilities.   Nets lined up Goran Dragic and were ready to cut their losses and move on. Dragic was amped to be on the Nets because Drazen Petrovic was a childhood hero of his. All of a sudden D.Will is given a ultimatum of either sign or leave the facilities and the Nets continue down a dark path. Dragic signs in Phoenix and gets traded to Miami later on.   What could have been in Brooklyn landed Melo and Howard instead or even Howard to pair with D.Will because you have to remember this was still while Howard was in his insane prime before the back injury in LA."
This is the exact same thing trae young did to Dwight Howard and no one blinked an eye
"Since his first few games I was saying Ayton will be the next Dwight Howard.....  And in discussions of draft position as #1, I like to compare his status to Hakeem ... Yes he is drafted over an all-time great (MJ, Luka in the making), but his team doesn't regret their choice that much"
"That's my point man, Karl Malone in the last minute of a game was like Ben Simmons this year.  A 1st team All-NBA regular season award melted away from players' minds come playoff time when you choke again &amp; again &amp; again like Karl Malone. Players talk. They saw Barkley SLAUGHTER in the playoffs, and eventually saw him match Jordan tit-for-tat. They saw Malone fumble balls away and miss free throws in the clutch in the playoffs every year.   Barkley was the closest to beating Michael Jordan in the Finals, and it was when MJ was at his apex prime. Malone couldn't beat a tired, older Jordan who was saddled with a fractured team about to implode while Pippen was playing with a crippled back. Barkley without a doubt had the better prime.  Someday, people will pore through the stats, and determine that your favorite clutch HOF superstar assassin you see today isn't as good as guys like KAT or Dwight Howard"
"&gt; If i spent 100000 hours doing the workouts Curry did and improving my shot i'm never getting as good because i don't have his talent, hand eye coordination and genes of being the son of an NBA shooter  Buuuuuut... you *would* become a better shooter than you'd be otherwise. And Dwight Howard had the athleticism and coordination of an NBA player. Nobody's saying that he should have become as good as Hakeem, but just adding some tools to his repertoire isn't something unthinkable."
"Lots and lots of years.   Think of Cousins, AD, KD, Dwade, Kobe, Klove, Kyrie, Wall, Lillard, etc etc.   It's basically every fucking year.   Shaq. Dwight Howard. Rudy Gay. Paul George. Westbrook. It goes on forever homie."
"No i understand, i mean Dwight had insane potential  He scored 20ppg without any good post moves other than ""I'm Dwight Howard i'm stronger, faster, can jump higher and more agile than you"" so i will bullyball you  So if he actually had a good post game he would have been way better"
"I swear it blows my mind, people solution to Ben Simmons is go on an open gym and shoot  Brother those people have taken million shots, we have stats of Dwight Howard shooting 80% at the line in practice with a sample size of thousands of free throws   In game it's a different thing"
"When did LeBron have the most first place votes? In 12-13 LeBron came on 2nd and had 18 first place votes while Gasol had 30. In 08-09 LeBron came in second and had 4 first place votes while Dwight had 105.  And first place votes don't matter, it's overall voting points. Like in 89-90 when Barkley had 38 first place votes and Magic had 27 but magic got the MVP.  By total voting points in 08-09 LeBron was 396 points behind Howard and was only 147 points ahead of guys like Joel Przybilla and Hedo T√ºrkoƒülu who among others got 1 single point. LeBron truly didn't even sniff the award that year.  In 12/13 Gasol had 40% more total and first place votes than LeBron. LeBron was actually closer to Larry sanders in 7th than Gasol in first. Again he really wasn't close to winning it and Gasol isn't a historic defender.  Jordan didn't need to play that hard in the regular season, he qon 6 titles and won more games in a 2 and 3 year span than anyone ever. But he did.  You are making excuses for LeBron. He isn't as good of defender as Mike. You want to make excuses but whatever. LeBron had every chance to be a full time defender and refused.  I'm taking about a 24 game sample and it's the only example we have. Jordan played in the triangle most of his career.  He didn't refuse to play PG"
"Yeah he probably won‚Äôt but it doesn‚Äôt hurt. The Nets should look to add and reacquire experienced players   Redick, James Johnson, Ariza, Blake, Dwight Howard"
"I know he was a coach on the rockets for a bit when Dwight Howard was there. However, I know he did a lot of private coachings with players like Carmelo, LeBron, Kobe, etc. Where he would teach them his footwork and postmoves. You can find the vids on YouTube"
Dwight Howard saving tens of millions of dollars in child support.
"i still fully believe cuban thinks this, but i myself do not. it just feels like an ‚Äúall in for dwight howard‚Äù offseason type move based on the absurd moonshot hope a guy like dame forces a trade because we have the guys he wants to play for now."
I think we all understand why.   What i don't understand is why people are on here pretending that there's absolutely no room in an NBA game to ever try stuff out.  Dwight Howard shoots a three every other game even though there's no learning benefit at all. Nobody says a thing to him about it
"Bruh he literally practices them, you think it's as simple as go to a gym and shoot and you get better?  LMAO i swear you people are funny, the guy plays for an NBA team with shooting coaches that get paid millions and there are videos of him at the gym praticing   If you think it's as simple as practice then why doesn't everyone become great?    Dwight Howard was a 80% free throw shooter in a gym, a gym vs NBA game is a different thing"
"You know what. That is an excellent question. I thought I recalled free throw routines that took some time and I looked up a few guys who came to mind but, for the most part they were more like 7 seconds long.    Some guys have had the same issue in the past (Dwight Howard and Karl Mallone) but, I suppose I spoke out of my ass a bit there."
i do recall an espn article about dwight howard being a slow free throw shooter.
Dwight Howard was the last one to get called for the voilation
"Imagine walk into a gas station store just to see D-Will, Lebron, Dwight Howard, CP3 and Chris Bosh."
"The 2006 Team USA led by LeBron, Wade, CP3, Melo, Dwight Howard, Bosh, etc lost to a Greece team without any NBA regular if I remember correctly."
"The gold medal match with Dwayne Wade LeBron &amp; Dwight Howard on the floor? We have MUCH more 3 point shooting on the team now. Spread it out, drive and kick."
"LeBron‚Äôs breakdown is: Ray Allen 185, Chris Bosh 356, Anthony Davis 113, Dwight Howard 83, Shaq 64, Wade 371, and Ben Wallace 104. Kyrie would add 235, Love would add 315. So he‚Äôs at 1826 if you include those guys."
"you're right. The U.S does have a big talent advantage but their team isn't as optimal as 08 for example and that's ignoring the big man choices.  Starting lineup 08   CP3 (best PG), Kobe (best SG), LeBron (best SF), Chris Bosh (top 5 PF), Dwight Howard (best C)  Starting lineup 21   Dame (3rd best PG), Beal (2nd best SG), KD (2nd best SF), Draymond (fantastic glue guy but not top 3 at position), Bam (4th best league big man roughly)  edit: Grant and Bam switch off on minutes"
That's like the Mark Cuban special. Getting rid of solid role players to try to sign a star and ending up with nothing. I remember when he tried to sign Dwight Howard for like 5 years running and dumped Tyson Chandler twice to try.
Lol are you trying to assert that 3 bpg is comparable to 1 bpg? Dirk averaged 1 bpg. I guess he was right there with Dwight Howard in terms of being a great rim protector üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Some how you‚Äôre  also suggestin 6ppg is nothing for some strange reason   Not to mention the fact that rebounding and rim protection was far more impactful in 08 than it is now.
"He‚Äôs in his own head. Just like Fultz was. He‚Äôs not Dwight Howard who‚Äôs incapable of shooting, he‚Äôs just thinking too much"
I know I didn't just read someone compare Dwight Howard to Giannis lol Dwight Howard! They aren't even comparable besides being 7 feet and called superman
"So, we got a disgruntled Dwight Howard, a washed up Nash, Payton, and Malone. And Gasol didn't specifically voice he wanted to be with the Lakers. We were just the only ones offering the Grizzlies anything"
"Well, here is Giannis ""Checks Under His Bed at Night for Jimmy Butler"" Flop-etokounmpo playoff record for everyone to see that he has never even won a legitimate playoff series before this year either:  Beginning of time to 1994: too scared of Jimmy Butler to be born  1994-2013: too scared of Jimmy Butler to come to the NBA  2014: so bad he didnt even play that much and he still cost his team 23 more games than the previous season  2015: peed his pants at the sight of Jimmy Butler's Bulls, lost in 6  2016: so scarred by his encounter with Jimmy Butler he refuses to make the playoffs  2017: Wins Most Improved Player and plays on a superteam with Rookie of the Year (better player than Joel Embiid for context) Malcolm Brogdon and Pistons legend Khris Middleton, still loses to a lowly Raptors team in 6 that got destroyed by Lebron.   2018: Lets his superteam down again to the Baby Celtics missing Hayward and Kyrie in 7 games  2019: After winning MVP because voters felt bad for him despite being on a superteam, barely squeaked by Pistons with an injured Blake Griffin (doesnt count, poor sportsmanship not to wait until Blake got better, but Giannis was scared again), beat the Baby Celtics (doesnt count because I said so), then lost in 6 to some random Canadian team led by some mute guy who hadn't played in two years. Used Brogdon as a scapegoat and Giannis cried until they let Brogdon walk (my uncle works for the Bucks, I know all the inside info and know all the players and wear all the flyest clothes and call the players by their nicknames, it's not a big deal though)  2020: Barely squeaked by Orlando without any of their good players (Doesnt count because Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tmac, and Dwight Howard all didnt play). Lost to the Miami Jimmy Butlers in 5 after being so scared that Giannis refused to finish the series."
"Free throw rate is a horrible measure for whose game relies on free throws. Dwight Howard leads the league, he doesn't rely on free throws, he's afflicted with them. The top 20 is awash with low volume bigs that get fouled because it's in the defense's best interests.   Devin Booker shoots a lot of free throws. This is a ridiculous conversation."
"Dwight Howard, Steve Nash, Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Pau Gasol, Antawn Jamison were all all star caliber players that either signed with you outright or voiced their opinions on being traded to your team"
"Reminded me of Dwight Howard when he got to the finals. Was young as hell, looked like MVP and DPOY. Never got back to the finals again until last year.  You never know what'll happen. That's why old players tell young players who reach this stage to leave it all on the floor because they may never get back. Nothing is guaranteed."
"Kings fan here and actually thinking about writing a post.   Context  It‚Äôs important to remember that the Kings are in the Pacific Division (Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, and Kings) plus also in the Western Conference (TrailBlazers, Jazz, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Thunder, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavericks, Spurs, and Rockets), so they have to be GOOD. Like 4th through 7th seed good in the East (Atlanta, NY, Boston, Miami GOOD).  Plan  Advanced Stats wise Fox is low level all star good, but no Trae Young/Jimmy Butler/Tatum and while his shooting has improved he‚Äôs more of a 1 3PT made a game guy than 5. So we HAVE to win with Defense and Playmaking, as long as Fox is our main guy.  Maybe a hot take but I think Halliburton makes an all star team before Fox and usurps him by his 3rd year, but either way the game plan has to be let Halliburton run the offense and use Fox as a Wide Receiver with his speed while they share the court. Delon Wright/Buddy/Justin James/Terrance Davis off the bench for the 3rd guard spot.  Forward-wise older Harrison Barnes, promising Robert Woodard, and our likely SF draft pick (Franz Wagner) give us enough coverage at 3 to not get crushed by better Small Forwards. But we really fall apart at the big man spots (PF/C) with only Marvin Bagley as our only under contract player.  This is where it looks hopeless. Even Bagley believers think that his only value is returning a late 1st and getting his $11M salary off the books. In Monty‚Äôs shoes I move him via waive if we can‚Äôt get a 2nd rounder and free up his cap space. Once we have that $11M back, we can sign one off Holmes back/Daniel Thesis/Otto Porter Jr. to fill a PF or C spot, bring back Metu/Jones to give back up C minutes, and use our Midlevel to sign Bismack Biyambo or Dwight Howard.  From there it‚Äôs all about the entire 9 man rotation committing to running down the opposing teams shot clock every possession and using Fox‚Äôs athleticism to get in front of every fast break."
Every time I see the old bucks arena I think if that Dwight Howard post
"Most Laker fans agreed at the time keepin Dwight Howard was preferred over Trezz, there was a weird misunderstanding between the FO and Dwight, probably due to the FO telling Dwight they hadn‚Äôt made a formal offer yet causing Dwight‚Äôs camp to look for security.  Either way, the Lakers did not lose because all the narratives Clips fans wanna use; they lost because of injuries first and foremost.   And you‚Äôre free to trash talk, but expect it back. Some of the shit yall were talking near the end of the year when we had our injury debacles were funny for a franchise who hasn‚Äôt proven shit."
Ayton is what people wanted Dwight Howard to play like when he was with the Lakers
I usually love watching players that have nice post moves but I remember not being a fan of prime Dwight Howard back in 2009-2013. Something about the way he moved seemed a bit stiff for me.
Jahil okafor and Dwight Howard would be the truth in 80's/90's
"This is super similar to Kat vs Clint Capella argument.  Clint Capella is a Great center just that position in finally loaded. Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, Clint, Kat etc  Back then you have DJ, a aging Dwight Howard and not much else in comparison."
"Lakers had the best front court in the NBA. They had Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, and Pau Gasol, with Artest. Their competition was Dwight Howard by himself."
"Randle is 6‚Äô8, that‚Äôs not gonna cut it. They need Dwight Howard or Jarrett Allen"
"Mavs are my second favorite team, and I remember the constant talks about getting prime D Will and Dwight Howard. Even broke up the championship team on those beliefs"
Except the team would more closely resemble the 2008 team minus dwight howard if you wanna take away a big. which won the gold lol
"He had more than 30 points or more in 4 of those 6 games, and he never had great teammates in any of those games. Its  2016 against GSW his best teammate was washed up Dwight Howard  2017 against Spurs and in 2018 against GSW his best teammate was Eric Gordon(CP3 was injured in game 7)  2019 his best teammate was CP3 who was pretty bad that year, even Eric Gordon outperformed in playoffs while Harden was averaging 35 points against the KD Warriors  2020 against OKC his best teammate was an injured Westbrook who averaged 14 points on 43% TS that series   Also no idea why you keep downvoting like me having 1 internet point less on reddit matters üíÄ"
"That wasn‚Äôt prime Kobe that we had in 2013, but he was still among the best in the league. He was basically the equivalent of Lakers Lebron back then. But lest we forget, when Marc Cuban typed up his formal complaint about the Chris Paul trade, something he mentioned is that the Lakers had enough assets left (Andrew Bynum) to go and trade for Dwight Howard. So that team would‚Äôve been Kobe, CP3 and Dwight at what turned out to be the tail end of his prime."
Lol imagine. Chris Paul shoots Dwight Howard
The Dwight Howard trade to Lakers was bad for everyone involved.
Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard in the corner hiding behind a plant: Not so super now man‚Ä¶
"I didn't see Shaq, but I saw the game Dwight Howard went 21/39 (on TV). It was hilarious. But they still beat the Warriors. He had 45 points and 23 boards."
Ehh he will have his Dwight Howard championship moment
"The Rockets beat the Clippers down 3-1 with James Harden and Dwight Howard, not T-Mac and Yao? The year both of them were injured they lost to the Lakers in the second round"
"If a defender is holding their ground and the offensive player is smashing into them its already a foul. But usually offensive players have post moves that are much easier and less physically taxing as brute strength. Turning over right or left shoulder for baby hooks, spins etc. Much easier to score than running over someone Dwight Howard or Shaq Style. The defensive player usually concedes some space on back downs to try and guard against baseline or middle secondary moves."
"Yeah I mean dwight Howard was literally down to his last shot with the lakers and was a serviceable center for them, why couldn‚Äôt Drummond in theory do the same."
"Unquestionable HoF but remember he is at his late 30's  With extensive injury record  No guarantee he is going to stay the same.  Me personally i pick CP3, why? Because if he is on his shit i feel we will win a chip  While with jrue im not sure if we are going to have as big of a ceiling. But we have higher floor for certain (because younger and less injury prone) as availability is the best ability  While it is sad that if we don't win the chip this year, because u never know what would happen in the future. But i rather enjoy the good times now. I still remember us being 15 win team and upvoting begging dwight howard to come to Milwaukee in free agency.  Just hope we can get giannis 1 ring"
"I actually just played the NBA Jam that came out for the Wii in 2010 which at this point is like playing the original in the early 2000's. First year of the Heatles, Michael Redd &amp; Brandon Jennings, Dwight Howard &amp; Vince Carter,  Melo &amp; Chauncey Nuggs, Steph &amp; Monta, Dirk &amp; Kidd, Kobe &amp; Pau, I could go on and on"
"Yep, dude is about to be the same legend as 2013 dwight howard"
"Again that is such a moot fucking point. Do you think the warriors didn‚Äôt give Harden all their defensive attention? Do you think the warriors were fucking sweating over Dwight Howard or Pat fucking Bev? Trevor Ariza??? Like holy shit man, blame every other series loss on him, but this one? That‚Äôs just fucking ridiculous. All you have said is ‚ÄúKlay outperformed him‚Äù ok??? Klay also had a 10x better team? It‚Äôs not fucking 1 on 1 out there."
This is Dwight Howard esque corny
Dwight Howard: The Movie
Dwight Howard
"...what?  the rockets were starting and playing josh smith and a 37 year old jason terry 30 fucking mins a game. corey brewer and terrence jones were literally the teams two best players off the bench and played over 20 mins a game  all 4 of those guys shot a combined 37%. each of em was below 40% from the field. dwight howard was literally playing on an injured leg he got from josh smith falling on him and he had to rehab it all offseason.  meanwhile the dubs had exactly 1 rotation player below 40%, and it was leandro barbosa who played 15 mins a game. most advanced stats point to the rockets not even being contenders that year. they outperformed most of their metrics thanks to hardens carry job in the regular season + josh smith and corey brewer literally having the best quarters of their career at the same time. every rockets fan will tell you how badly the clippers outplayed us that series. we won cuz they panicked in game 6 thanks to doc never making any adjustments, and ultimately choked"
Dwight Howard and Danny Green just seen Ben Simmons chuck their whole season away cause he can't make a free throw/scared to take a layup yet they aren't pissed about it?      Crazy
"You're writing like someone from /r/iamverysmart  Luck is measurable in that you can compare occurrences of ""luck"" for a given person against other people. Example: winning the lottery. Example: being born white in America. Example: having the genes to be 7'2 but with top 0.1% athleticism, also born in america.  These are luck. An individual cannot control them, but there are measurable occurrences of these things happening to some, but not others. Dwight Howard, through really no action on his own or his parents, was born with the genes to become Dwight Howard. He prepared for the possibility of an NBA career, and the opportunity arrived that he prepared for, but there are lots of kids that don't end up with that opportunity."
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There‚Äôs really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year‚Äôs team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."
The Rockets won 57 and Harden‚Äôs best teammate was a past his prime Dwight Howard who only played 41 games that season. He also blew him out of the water statistically.
Curry once boxed out Dwight Howard https://youtu.be/SzszeBrAj5s. So yeah it‚Äôd be pretty entertaining to see Curry play as a big man against regular sized people
"I remember seeing these same videos with, Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard lol."
"I guess you missed the part where I stated I was going to edit it when I got the chance, so hopefully you‚Äôll read the entire comment this time. Tell me what other teams do you think qualify as a super team? Because forming a stacked team through the draft is not a super team - which is why the Warriors pre-KD are not a super team while the Warriors post signing KD are a super team. Adding an aging star chasing a ring is not a super team - otherwise Dwight Howard on the Lakers last year makes them a super team. So tell me where prior to the Celtics do you see a sudden super team form? I said in my first comment they were weaker compared to what followed, but that still doesn‚Äôt disqualify them from being the first super team. Especially considering they won the chip that first year, managed to make it back to the finals two years later, and only got knocked off following that because a new and stronger super team had formed."
"i have no doubt ben can hit 10 straight threes in an empty gym  shaq and dwight howard can do it even  doesn't mean he can ever hit them in a game situation though, in a gym when you are in a rhythm of doing nothing but shoot 3 pointers makes it a lot easier"
"He was battling Dwight Howard as the leagues best big man in 2012. Bynum was an all star that season but his knees were glass. Got traded to the [Cavs](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAIFPspWAAMIla3?format=jpg&amp;name=small), [Sixers](https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/02/19/andrew-bynum-hair) and eventually flamed out of the league."
"The closest comparison to Bill Russell is Dwight Howard   If you put Bill Russell in the modern day, the Celtics would have been built like the 2009 Magic"
"I‚Äôd say Dwight Howard. I know he‚Äôs not there rn, but he‚Äôs first ballot"
Yup all the big man like javale Mcgee and Dwight Howard showing off their 3 pt range but only shoot it in a game just to troll. Adams should be in the paint doing what he's best at. I'd want him to work on having a better hook shot (over each shoulder) and a better drop step but I guess big men are allergic to that nowadays. Like I get if your a agile big man who can't really bang but Adams is a brute of a man. His damage should be being disruptive in the paint. He'd need to shoot a consistent 38% on high volume before I'd think it ever be viable.
"HAHAHAHAHAH. Not even the best center when he played. He was leagues better than Wilt Chumperlain. Anyone who actually has watched Bill would know that he OWNS Bill. Wilt was absolutely owned by Russell in head-to-head match-ups and Bill created (solely I must say) the single greatest defensive dynasty ever. The idea that Bill wasn't the best center is purely from boxscore watchers like you going back and saying ""Woah Wilt score point! Wilt good at basketball!!!!"" Wilt isn't even in the GOAT convo. Very little longevity comparatively and his prime is WEAK. He demanded post-touches and generally weakend the offenses of teams around him despite his individual scoring numbers.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Russell owned all of the top centers of the era and it wasn't even the weakest era. The 70s is SIGNIFICANTLY weaker because of the ABA but nobody talks about Kareem having problems because of his competition even though during his Bucks years he was beating up on easier comp. We only bring up level of competition when it comes to Russell even though he showed abilities that would translate even to this stage of the game. He was as quick as Hakeem with the leaping ability of a prime Dwight Howard while also having the IQ of someone like KG or Draymond. The only reason PPG merchants like you will continually underrate the greatest center of our game is because they just simply don't understand the intricacies of basketball and haven't watched prime Bill."
"Maybe add Harden, PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, hold on to Eric Gordon, maybe bring in Melo and Dwight Howard for the bench and you'd have a pretty good team right there."
"friends at my lunch table started talking about dwight howard, lebron, dwayne wade, and kobe back in 09‚Äô and they were the only basketball players i recognized (before i was interested in sports)"
"Yeah that‚Äôs true. I just remember after we played the Warriors in the 2015 WCF, the team regressed so much the next year. Ty Lawson was supposed to put us over the top, but he just flamed out. Harden got off to a slow start and didn‚Äôt make an All-NBA team. Dwight Howard regressed. And our key role players that played well the previous year just either regressed or fell off a cliff, like Corey Brewer, Josh Smith, Terrence Jones, Etc.  And in terms of the 2018-19 team being a disappointment. Losing guys like Mbah A Moute and Trevor Ariza Hurt us and then you have Carmelo being waived after like 10 games and CP3 being banged up and looking washed most of that year too"
"from the looks of it, Greg Oden was the size of embiid with better athleticism. Jumped higher and ran faster than durant in the combine. Granted all of this may have led to his glass knees. The transition to 3pt shooting didn't happen until the mid 2010s and most bigs at the time sucked, so Oden would have been the most dominant center in the league after Dwight Howard."
Dwight Howard looks awesome in these drills. Won't shoot them in a game though. His excuse? Don't want to look stupid if he misses.
Dwight ‚ÄúPower bottom‚Äù Howard
Do you not remember how this sub got with Dwight Howard rumors?
It's so impressive that he was able to do that. I think people underestimate how difficult being a good shooter is at that size and strength. There's a reason most NBA players that are 6'9 and jacked aren't good shooters. Like every time I watch Dwight Howard shoot a free throw I'm amazed he can make them at all.
"Orlando Magic Dwight Howard was a beast. Legit MVP candidate. The team was well constructed around Dwight with Jameer, Rashard, Hedo, young JJ, Lee."
Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons do this shit daily lol
"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed ‚ÄúPlayoff Rondo‚Äù.  KCP: ‚ÄúBinary Mamba‚Äù for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers‚Äô Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe‚Äôs word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers ‚Äúain‚Äôt the one‚Äù. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become ‚Äúwashed‚Äù. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to ‚Äúgood‚Äù teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, ‚Äúto continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation‚Äù. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. ‚ÄúFOR KOBE‚Äù is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets‚Äô bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a ‚Äúmickey mouse ring‚Äù or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  ‚ÄúJob‚Äôs not done‚Äù  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
"No.  *Pound for pound* it's Steph ""boxing out Dwight Howard when he had way less muscle than he does now"" Curry."
Bam Adebayo looks life if you tried to draw Dwight Howard from memory
Like a young Dwight Howard?
Dwight Howard??
Ayton is reminding me so much of Orlando Dwight Howard.  Not as much scoring but so dominant on the boards and finishes everything with a dunk or oop
Dwight Howard is the happiest looking dude I've ever seen
"Lakers 2020 w a hyped up, towel waiving Dwight Howard is TNT üß® üí•üíØ   Lakers 2021 is this no juice excuse!!  Need to rail some Adderall before get on set Yo!"
The Dwight Howard meantweet was amazing
Dwight Howard shot 88% from the line in practice  There's videos of him looking like KD+LeBron in an open gym lmao
"Yeah it's not spot on, Rhino was just a rookie with potential on the Nets but did become MIP and a core piece of the Dwight Howard Magic teams."
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who‚Äôs good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
"Dwight Howard wasn't exactly in his prime for us, but he still put up allstar caliber numbers for us. Still remember that mean 30-30 game he had here too. Turns out that is his last season as a starting center for a full season."
He joins the likes of ‚Äò09 Dwight Howard (23) and ‚Äò07 Lebron (22) as the only players 24 or younger to lead a finals team in scoring since 2000
"Damn, even for his ""he's not serious"" critiques, Dwight Howard actually took training and advice from Hakeem. Ben couldn't even take the time or lessons?"
"Dwight Howard lmao just kidding but on a serious note draymond green, personally hate him as a player but he knows his stuff"
Making Dwight Howard look like an amateur.
"&gt;This is why its always quietly amusing to me people bemoan stuff like Blake Griffin or Dwight Howard getting roped into child support payments.   I don't get it. Was it not their children? You should pay child support either way then, doesn't matter if you're rich or poor."
"I think the big reason why Drummond is considered bad is due to expectations. For some people who purely looks at stats, they think Drummond is some monster C like prime Dwight Howard. When they actually see him play, their expectations are shattered when they find out he‚Äôs only alright. I think this leads to a negative response for those people as they are disappointed."
"Dwight Howard, Marcus Morris, Trez (tries to be), James Johnson, Udonis Hasslem still technically is an NBA player, Mike Scott, Boogie, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs mores. But yeah most of these guys can‚Äôt hold a candle to the guys you listed, and I also think the enforcer role dramatically lost its usefulness with rule changes punishing over the top physicality."
Dwight Howard and the lakers
Dwight Howard burner üëÄ
Because Dwight Howard had a better season
"I think you don't quite grasp it.  Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin have each made over 220 million dollars. Cash. That is enough money to buy multiple homes outright and fund kids, nieces, and grandkids all going to college, getting them started in their first cars and houses and if you were smart having 20-50 million set aside in a low cost index fund so the money is perpetually earning new money matching the current productivity rate of the stock markets.  I'd argue its approaching an immoral sum of cash"
because it could get even more expensive when you don't....   just ask shawn kemp or dwight howard
"Vacations, expensive cars or collectibles, sometimes dinner at like a 5 star restaurant, real estate, their children.  This is why its always quietly amusing to me people bemoan stuff like Blake Griffin or Dwight Howard getting roped into child support payments. These guys are making multiple lifetime's worth of cash for 4 year contracts or what have you. These guys who have gotten a max NBA contract aren't gonna hurt for a penny unless they're wildly dumb"
It's because when you're not fatigued you have better muscle control. Same reason Dwight Howard can shoot 90% from the line in practice.  In real game situations you're basically relying on muscle memory bc anything that isn't effectively subconscious form breaks down. So when Simmons was in HS he probably wasn't really breaking a sweat vs now defending elite NBA opposition.  Try it sometime: try doing fine motor tasks before and after doing 10 minutes of HIIT. The drop-off will be much steeper for ones you don't have the muscle memory for.
Remember when Dwight Howard wanted the NBA to change their logo to the cross? lol
*2015-2016 rockets*:  Patrick Beverley   Harden  Corey Brewer   Ariza   Dwight Howard  *2016-2017 rockets*:  Harden  Patrick Beverley  Ariza   Ryan Anderson  22 year old Clint Capela   Both of those teams are worse than the current Mavericks.
prime dwight howard
"Make up all the excuses you want, and downplay it all you like. A team that has Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul, and Dwight Howard, should never lose the gold. Funny to think that same Miami super team trio would then lose to underdog Dallas in 2011. Really kinda says something."
"They could, upsets happen.   In 2006 Greece beat the USA in the Final tournament without a single NBA player on their roster, that US team included prime Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, and Dwight Howard."
"fix the animations/glitches/AI  there was a time when the computer would just cheese the same move with the same player all game so he‚Äôd drop like 60-70 points. there was a year of 2k where if you passed to literally anyone after a drive they‚Äôd just shoot it automatically, led to guys like dwight howard launching 5 threes a game. there was a year they introduced intercepting passes and nobody could pass into the paint against the AI.   there is always something to fix."
You miss 100% of the shots that you don‚Äôt take.  -Dwight Howard
"Dwight Howard is the only player in NBA history to play for the same team 3 times, making an All-Star game and winning a championship in that time."
"These comments show just how much r/nba actually knows about the players lmao. Ben and Dwight are good friends and Ben has talked about how much he appreciates having Dwight around:  &gt; ‚ÄúSomething I need to do to,‚Äù said Simmons. ‚ÄúGet back on the floor, Dwight‚Äôs been pushing me to get better, so now he came out on the floor with me. Got some shots up. He‚Äôs just pushing me. He wants me to be great, and I really appreciate that.‚Äù  https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2020/12/23/sixers-star-ben-simmons-puts-up-shots-with-dwight-howard-after-win/"
When Dwight Howard is roasting your shooting that says a lot
Dwight Howard vs James Johnson in Finals let's go.
Have any of these guys ever shot 100% from 3 in the finals like Dwight Howard?
they‚Äôll be a good half court defensive team but i just watched dwight howard tank the sixers transition defense all year. adding melo to the mix is not gonna help that lol
Bam needs that Dwight Howard inside strength package.
Ah yes Dwight Howard. The goat shooter.
If I‚Äôm him I‚Äôm signing on the minimum to a contender and hope that I have a Reggie Jackson/Dwight Howard/Rajon Rondo sort of break out deep playoff run and then get some money the next off season.
Great news for the Lakers who needed to find some verticality inside.  Dwight Howard will bring all that to this team.
Remember when Rudy Fernandez dunked it on Dwight Howard in Beijing. Man time flies. Rubio still here though :)
For real dude. Just like Chris Bosh should have been benched for getting blocked by Nate Robinson. Or Dwight Howard when he was blocked by Wade. Or fucking PATRICK EWING when he got blocked by MUGSEY BOUGES.....just chill out. Good thing you're only a coach in NBA 2K.
"He‚Äôs not playing both sides.  He will say LeBron had a great roster and got carried if they win, he‚Äôll say it‚Äôs an embarrassing collapse by LeBron if they lose.  Basically he‚Äôs building up the Lakers teammates so he can shit on LeBron.  Pretending like Wayne Ellington is anything but a bench role player, like Ariza isn‚Äôt 2+ years past making a meaningful contribution, and like Dwight Howard will do anything but get 5 boards, 2 lobs and 3 fouls per game."
That's like asking why can't Shaq and Dwight Howard improve their shooting. Why can't they shoot like Dirk
"LeBron, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Carmelo and Russ were all in the 2012 All Star game, as was Luol Deng who is also still technically on their roster. Recent Laker Rajon Rondo was also in that game, as were buyout candidate Kevin Love and current Lakers target Andre Iguodala. AD made the 2014 game:  Westbrook, James, Anthony, Davis, Howard.   Rondo, Iguodala, Deng, Love, Gasol.   TL;DR: Finalise Melo and Iguodala, bring Rondo back, wait for a Love buyout and get the decrepit corpse of Luol Deng back on the court, boys. We're winding back the clock."
"Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gay, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard  Early 2010's cheat code, and then AD came not long after, with Ariza and Marc Gasol off the bench too."
lol what?? There's almost no resemblance at all. Dwight Howard was always a traditional post up center. He had a better Post up game at 18 years old than Giannis has ever had in his entire life. Tell me you started watching basketball 5 years ago without telling me you only started watching basketball 5 years ago lmao. Dwight in his prime and Shaq had near identical play-styles.
"If getting Trevor ariza‚Äôs corpse, old dwight howard, wayne EllingtonüòÇ and steph curry‚Äôs best friend are ur definition of stacked you are on sum.üòÇ"
Dwight Howard
"Role in the game. Javale Mcgee in 2020 looks like he had a bigger role for the Lakers from the outside perspective. He started more games, played more minutes. But his role was to give them good,solid minutes through the Season against a variety of other teams. When it mattered most and when they played the better teams.. Dwight Howard was the primary center in the playoffs. He played in all the clutch moments, played against the others teams best big- his ROLE was bigger in the game because of the talents he has. More minutes does not mean youll play the most important minutes or be part of the smaller rotation come playoff time. Theres more to it than seconds and minutes its when you play and the spot they put you in."
Yeah see the Lakers are going to go with an all-spacing lineup of:  C: Dwight Howard  PF: AD  SF: Lebron  SG: Westbrook  PG: Schroder
Lemme just say that neither kuz or kcp could guard pg or kd. Kawhi roasted both of them. I‚Äôd rather have Westbrook confidently brick a 3 with rage then see kuz or kcp put up some timid shit and crawl into a corner and wait for Dwight Howard to back them up. No one seems to notice what‚Äôs going out vs what‚Äôs coming in.
I like how tier 0 is player accounts yet last year Dwight Howard announced he was re-signing with the Lakers on his Twitter only to sign with the Sixers lmao

I look forward to teams going under on the Russell Westbrook Dwight Howard pick and roll.
i'm waiting for the lakers dwight howard photoshops
"Death, taxes and Dwight Howard to the Lakers"
"Just wait till the Lakers pickup Melo, Dwight Howard and all your favorite draft picks from 03-05."
"Dwight Howard hasn't signed yet, but he's expected to return to the Lakers."
Dwight Howard technically
"Yea that‚Äôs what bothers me, he never even attempts shots. God forbid a 3. Dwight Howard even took a few 3s when left open. He made some and missed most but the crowd loved that he tried."
"Eh the Rockets didn‚Äôt really get that many big FAs. Washed Dwight Howard, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, PJ Tucker were the notable ones"
"Just because you can play him alongside Jarrett Allen, doesn't mean you should.  Just because Anthony Davis can play alongside Dwight Howard doesn't mean he should.  Just because Chris Bosh can play alongside Joel Anthony doesn't mean he should.  Just because Al Horford can play alongside Joel Embiid doesn't mean he should."
"Jamal Crawford, Avery Bradley, Wes Matthews, Jr Smith, Isaiah Thomas, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay and Darren Collison"
Imagine telling Laker fans in 2013 that Dwight Howard would return for a 3rd time in 2021 and Laker fans would be happy about it.
"&gt; And he's an extremely good play maker for the guys around him  Lol only in transition. 80% of plays are in the half court, during which Simmons is relegated to standing in the dunker's spot and setting some screens. He's essentially 2021 Dwight Howard with transition playmaking ability."
It's this. The year dwight howard was a free agent in his prime we missed out on guys like iggy because we waited on dwight. Too often instead of making realistic moves I think Cuban tries too hard to push for the huge stars.
What stars? Just Dwight Howard ?    Everyone else got traded to him.
"New Orleans with a super young Davis, an aging grit and grind Grizzlies,  the Dwight Howard led Rockets before Harden took the leap, and Lebron and Delly, no. That isn‚Äôt all that difficult to manage."
"No lol  New Orleans Pelicans starting PG Jrue Holiday was limited to 55 minutes total and missed one game of the Warriors' sweep entirely coming off a stress reaction in his right tibia. Memphis Grizzlies starting PG Mike Conley missed Game 1 of the series with Golden State because of a facial fracture, and starting SF Tony Allen played just five minutes over the last two games because of a sore left hamstring. The Houston Rockets played without starting PG Patrick Beverley and backup F/C Donatas Motiejunas, while starting C Dwight Howard played through a torn MCL and torn meniscus suffered during the Western Conference finals. In the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without starting PF Kevin Love because of shoulder surgery early in the playoffs and lost starting PG Kyrie Irving to a fractured patella late in Game 1."
And Chris Paul and Dwight Howard
"This is what people don‚Äôt say enough about. Cuban has a rep for being a huge fan and involved, and maybe even relatable/accessible to the fan.  But he‚Äôs publicly called Westbrook a non-star player (years ago, before all the trades), derided AAU ball (where most guys start out), allowed years of dysfunction in his front office and operations sides, always has to have a comment about something and made a wildly corny pitch in the one really serious chance they had to secure a superstar in Dwight Howard.  And that‚Äôs not even mentioning that his missing the meeting with then-FA Deron Williams is known to be the reason the Mavs went from being the favorite to sign him to missing him entirely! He has a history of bad decision making that is buoyed by Dirk going supernova in 2011 and now having another generational star. No way it doesn‚Äôt play any factor into FA‚Äôs decisions."
"I will say when you look back at the list of FA targets Dallas gets linked to targeting that they miss on, it‚Äôs usually a huge bullet dodged - Carmelo, Deron Williams, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan, etc. Those contracts usually wind up being awful."
"Dwight Howard, Gary Payton, and Gary Payton? Dude must hate condoms if he brought the glove up twice"
Dwight Howard shoots better from three than Simmons
"Not a Mavs fan so this could be wildly inaccurate, but I legit just think Dallas doesn't know how to pitch to free agents. They struggle with not just stars but even role players and it makes no sense unless their meetings are leaving players unimpressed  Like thinking back with Dwight Howard they did all this weird comic book Superman style stuff and that's not exactly the best image you wanna be presenting when your job is to sell your team is wanting to win at all costs. I remember with lamarcus Aldridge he said a similar thing about the Lakers, how when he went their for FA meetings their entire presentation was about Hollywood and shit and nothing bout hoops, and when he ragged on them in the media for that that's what pushed their franchise to overhaul the front office  Idk tho, just my thoughts looking outside in. Just makes no sense to me why they struggle so much getting anyone to sign"
"SA got LaMarcus Aldridge. Houston got Dwight Howard and Eric Gordon. Not exactly star-studded there, but Texas has nice cheap land and no state income tax."
Not easy when dwight howard is allowed to hack you 20 times a game
"Bro, he didn't run it back with the 2011 team because he thought he was the smartest guy in the NBA with respect to the new cap and thought saving money/flexibility would be more important. He let Tyson walk twice. He didn't even meet with Deron Williams the summer we were chasing after him. He showed Dwight Howard a superhero cartoon as his big FA pitch. The list goes on and on.   Here's two articles from 2014 where we realized even back then, just a year out from that draft, that the Mavs made a colossal mistake by overruling the GM on Giannis but Cuban still wouldn't admit to it.   * [https://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/mavericks/post/\_/id/4703905/why-didnt-the-mavs-draft-the-greek-freak](https://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/mavericks/post/_/id/4703905/why-didnt-the-mavs-draft-the-greek-freak) * [https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2014/12/9/7344297/mark-cuban-passed-on-giannis-antetokounmpo](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2014/12/9/7344297/mark-cuban-passed-on-giannis-antetokounmpo)"
"Never forget that the Mavs were going to draft Giannis but Cuban overruled them to trade down (twice) to save $400k of cap space to go after Dwight Howard in FA. At least the Mavs ended up with another legend of that draft, Shane Larkin."
"Lowry,Dame,Beal,Kawhi heck even Dwight Howard coming back for the third stints...."
"The Mavs have signed Seth Curry, Wes Matthews, Deandre Jordan, tried to sign Dwight Howard, and traded for pieces like Tyson Chandler, Shawn Marion and Monta Ellis over the last few years. Not sure where the ‚ÄúEuropean bias‚Äù is coming from other than his comments while he was riding the high from drafting Luka. Also not sure what you‚Äôre implying with the Montreal/Luka issue, that doesn‚Äôt connect to Cuban at all. Mavs got plenty of other things to criticize like how they hire coaches and front office staff"

Man it‚Äôs the off-season and we‚Äôre talking about starting Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony on the Lakers.   Obviously they are HOFers.
"Someone will sign him and get good value also. His last year at Cleveland he every 17 1/2 points and 13 1/2 rebounds. He played on bad teams and collected the blame for others inefficiencies.  His biggest deficit is lateral movement on defense he needs to lose a few pounds and get more quickness in that defensive posture may be too late for him to make that improvement  who knows. But some one is signing a double-double machine and if he goes to a good team he'll look as good as that team  I think Drummond has been a victim of bad coaching, like Van gundy trying to turn him into a Dwight Howard clone. No one tried to expand his game or  wouldn't allow it. But if he goes to the right team he's going to look very good"
"They prob just suck at pitchung to free agents. Remember when they put together a whole ass comic book style Superman pitch for Dwight Howard? Lol these dudes are hoopers, they don't care bout that shit"

Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K
"Dwight Howard seems like he would be a great fit, although I think the Warriors messed up by disrespecting him a few years ago, so not sure if he would sign there."
Oh I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm a pretty big laker fan but I love watching jokic and am super glad to see big offensive minded centers still be able to dominate. I never though I‚Äôd say this 2 years ago but I just think Dwight Howard is a great piece to have on a cheap deal
"That's just a play on the old fanfic that Westbrook and Kevin Love would team up on the Lakers from around 2013. In that universe, Durant was a straight up trade to the Clippers for Blake Griffin (they had similar value and contracts) during the Lob City era, which made sense because Griffin had played in Oklahoma during college.  Also there was the CP3 to team up with Dwight Howard on the Hornets rumor that never panned out.  NBA is fun fanfiction."
"I would say Ewing for never win an MVP. Certainly Ewing over Chris Paul, Dominique Wilkins, Dwight Howard, Gary Payton‚Ä¶  John Stockton is a good one for this though too"
"Report: Lakers also have ‚Äòstrong interest‚Äô in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, and the Statue of Liberty."
Not at the peak doesn't mean they can't play. Melo is getting blackballed that's why he having trouble getting contracts. Dwight Howard is still solid but they tried to push him out too. Them dude's still play at a high level
Melo not washed up. Dwight Howard not washed up. Russ not washed up. Wtf are you talkin about? These are former Allstars
&gt; what reason is there to talk about zion right now?  I am kind of curious how his rehab is going. Is he going to come to camp with body by Dwight Howard or Jared Dudley?
"Fun fact 9 year old fact. Afflalo would find his way back to the Magic, via a trade, in the famous four team Dwight Howard to the Lakers trade."
"Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis, LeBron James and Russel Westbrook. Holy shit. That is some ugly ass basketball.   I hope JJ Reddick starts at SG. 2012 all over again!"

100% Dwight Howard
"Carmelo yes, d rose and klay no   Dwight Howard has a case as well"
"Your comment got me to Google Dwight because I wanted to check how old he was now and TIL, Dwight Howard is the brother-in-law of Sharife Cooper who was drafted by the Hawks last night."
It wouldn't even be the biggest failure in the last 10 years. That would go to the Dwight Howard Lakers.
"Man, Dwight Howard is like a Generic player in 2k, that Will leave ur team for 1 season then return on next season."
"Shaq ""thinks about what he says"" and the quality of his commentary is still garbage. He gets paid millions to give generic takes like ""Dwight Howard needs to 20 and 10"" or the Hawks won because ""Trae Young scored 30"". He's just reading the boxscore at this point, ala Magic Johnson on twitter.  People watch Inside the NBA for the jokes and Chuck is the main source of that. Shaq's best known for laughing at Chuck's antics."
"I agree so hard. From the moment he was drafted I was telling people he's gonna be the next Dwight Howard. Yeah he's raw but holy shit just watching him play can be hype, when his game sense improves he'll be a monster."
"jazz @ sixers right before the all star break was fucking amazing. dwight howard hit a 3 while we were down double digits in the forth. we rallied back by the end of the game and embiid hit this disgusting step back 3 to tie it. tobias harris dominated in overtime, and we won. probably the high point of the season tbh, cause right after the all star break embiid injured his knee and was out for 3 weeks and simmons sorta fell off"
‚ÄúDwight Howard in the post dawg‚Äù   Sorry that‚Äôs all I got.
Kobe was a dogshit awful leader. Chased the best player on the team out of town like a spoiled brat and look how he treated Dwight Howard when he was playing through his injuries
Just watch. It's a respect factor. LeBron gets his troops to play the right way.  He made Dwight Howard change his entire perception. Went from being the most toxic player in the league to one of the better locker room guys in the league and a champion.  LeBron is a miracle worker.üôèüèæ
"Carmelo Anthony, Monta Ellis, Nate Robinson, Dwight Howard"
Dude just needs to work with Dwight Howard for his shoulders
"Good point. If Iggy comes back on a vet min, that's one more who played a significant chunk with the franchise already. As a fan I'm hoping for Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, or Batum to come along for the MLE."
"We talking about Lakers history, we shouldn't be ranking him until he actually plays. We could have had these same projections for Dwight Howard in 2012, and we see how that experiment ended."
"People still make ""Dwight Howard is gay"" jokes today though lmao"
Dwight Howard!!
"I just want to put into perspective how nuts it is to have 7 all-stars (former or current) on one team.  In SEVENTEEN YEARS since the Bobcats expansion in 2004, the Bobcats and Hornets have had a total of seven former or current all-stars:  Gerald Wallace, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Dwight Howard, Juwan Howard, Tony Parker, and Theo Ratliff"
Enjoy the battle of Dwight Howard vs Bruce Brown while all the stars are injured
The same thing happened when Grizz legend Dwight Howard was on the team for 12 hours
resign dwight howard!
Dwight Howard after he got SVG fired.
"Ron Artest, Dwight Howard, CP3, traded for Harden, did NOT sign Chandler Parsons, nearly pulled off the Pau Gasol trade. I will absolutely blame him for the Westbrook one though, even though it was prob the owner‚Äôs fault.   how can you just throw out his best trade? You might as well do the same for all the GMs you listed, what‚Äôs Masai without the Kwahi trade, Meyers if he didn‚Äôt draft Curry, Schlenk if he didn‚Äôt draft Trae? That‚Äôs just absurd. Throw out the one transaction that each GM did to land a superstar, then of course they look mediocre."
"Rebounding wasn't the problem  In Charlotte he was bad at everything else. He tried to be a post up big and massively failed at it. Didn't put in effort in defense, didn't screen shooters, traveled at least once per game if not more, probably set some record for most goaltends, etc  You know everything Andre Drummond gets flack about? He's basically a carbon copy of what Dwight Howard was for us."
"There‚Äôs like a million other places to put that anger. Dwight Howard, your shit ass management, Shaq, lots of places."
"&gt;Harden Rockets years have to be recognized as a failure  Ultimately, yes, they were a failure. I think you might agree, however, that different teams have different expectations and their success/failure is relative to those expectations.  The Rockets never missed the playoffs with James Harden. Off the top of my head they had the second best winning percentage over that time span (maybe third). They were consistently a ""contender"" and, when they lost, it was always to a higher seeded team with two exceptions:  * 2018 the top seed Rockets lost to the 2 seed Warriors (who were still the favorites) and were up 3-2 when Chris Paul got hurt. The Warriors won the next two with CP3 out and then swept the finals. This was the one that got away. * 2014 to the Trailblazers b/c Parsons couldn't close out his man. Ugh. Nightmare fuel.   Really only 2014 is a failure in that sense. You are supposed to lose to the higher ranked team.   Also, if you take any of those seasons between 2012-2020 and give them to the Twolves...it's a HUGE success...with or without the ring - b/c their expectations were so low.  And that's why it was, in fact, a failure.   By 2013 we knew we had expectations. It looked wide open. The Warriors were just another playoff team. Harden was special. We just had Dwight Howard come join up. Then...Morey really went all in. I love the guy, but we had been selling our future for years. That was ok, because we all knew there was a window and we wanted to squeeze at least one championship in before it closed.  Then it closed. Blame it on Fertitta or injuries or the Warriors or whatever, but it closed. We went all in and it didn't work out.   It was definitely a failure...but the kind that every team wants to have."
Was Dwight Howard like that? I don't know so I can't answer completely
"Jason Richardson. Dude was as athletic as they come. Might be more memorable with a more unique name.   Dwight Howard - people know how good he was back then, but also they definitely don't.   Elton Brand - dude was as sturdy as they come and was always a hard matchup."
"They‚Äôve tried hard to sign non white stars and no one is interested in coming here. We swung and missed on Lowry, Butler, Beal, Kemba, Dwight Howard, Giannis, Kawhi, DeRozan, Conley, Grant, etc‚Ä¶   I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a conscious choice, we are signing players who are interested in playing with us, most of them want to play with Luka (Goran Dragic, fellow country man) or Lauri Markkanen who expressed interest in playing here. If Bradley Beal or Lowry had wanted to play here we 100% would‚Äôve signed them."
"Grant Hill, Shaquille O Neal, Penny Hardaway, Dwight Howard"
Lakers gave him a deal concept.  https://lakersnation.com/lakers-rumors-dwight-howard-misinterpreted-deal-concept/2020/11/21/   They dont do that if they aren't if they arent't iterested
"You could do that for just about any player but this sub chooses to single out Wade every Time. LeBron, Kobe, CP3, KG, Rondo, Dwight Howard have all committed multiple dirty plays but nobody mentions them."
"Alright now, let‚Äôs not act like Hardens been alone. You‚Äôre comparing his team to previous teams that have won the chip. This isn‚Äôt a Portland-Dame situation. He played with Russ and Durant in OKC, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook in Houston. The team in ‚Äò18 was amazing in defensive versatility and had legit shooters. Compare the 18 team to the suns team that just went to the finals. Are you really taking younger cp3/ariza/tucker/capela over older cp3/ayton/crowder/bridges? I‚Äôm not saying harden isn‚Äôt a superstar.  But acting like he hasn‚Äôt choked in big moments and always come up a bit short is pretty naive.    Let‚Äôs go back one season to the ‚Äò20 lakers. Davis/ old rondo/kuzma/kcp. Obviously Davis is better than cp3 but besides that the rockets had the better players. In the time harden was off the floor in Houston with cp3, cp3 was still playing really well. He made cp3 just a spot up shooter, and then ran the entire offense. Don‚Äôt just gloss over the mistakes that team made to lose. They had that chance, game 5, tied and Durant goes down. Proceed to the lose the game. Game 6, they are facing just the previous warriors team, not a super team, and harden choked hard in the last quarter. They could have taken that chance, proven they could win and go on to beat the trailblazers."
"Dwight Howard will not be forgotten at all! The man is a 3x DPOY &amp; took his team to the Finals! Over Lebron, &amp; not to mention with the Orlando Magic, it‚Äôs not everyday they are in the finals. Also the Superman dunk was pretty memorable.  Dwight won‚Äôt be forgotten, he‚Äôs a first ballot hall of famer"
"I've always liked Dwight Howard. I was pumped when he signed with the Hawks. One of those feelings when your favorite player(outside your team) finally signs with your team. Wish it would've worked out, but it just didn't mesh right.  Side note: I have Howard jerseys for every team up to Hornets, then I had to stop.  1. He switched so many teams.  2. Couldn't/can't find the jersey."
Dwight Howard
May I interest you in one 2012 Dwight Howard trade?
"Outside of vucevic, who made the team twice and was a fringe selection, the last all star from Orlando was Dwight Howard about a decade ago. Orlando is not in a good state right now and someone like issac will not get the recognition he deserves without a team that is competing in some capacity. Does not change his skill level, just his notoriety and ability to get awards."
"To me, a superteam is a team of multiple (at least 2) superstars, meaning players in their primes who are arguably top 5ish MVP caliber at the time, along with at least one more allstar.    The big three Celtics just had two borderline top 10 players and an allstar. Superstars in the late 2000s LBJ, Kobe, Tim Duncan, Dirk, Dwade, CP3, maybe Nash and Dwight Howard. To me, big 3 Celtics are just a great team, not a super team. Same with the 80s Celtics. McHale was not a Bird/Magic/Kareem/Barkley/IT caliber player, he wasn't a superstar.   The 2012 thunder or 2013-15 spurs don't even come close to Superteam status. Harden was coming off the bench and Russ wasn't MVP caliber until after KD left. On the spurs, their was no way old ass 37 year old Tim Duncan and Kawhi (not even an Allstar yet) with Tony Parker, a borderline all-star by the mid 2010s, is considered a superteam when none of these guys were superstars at the time.   The only real superteams I know of are the current Nets, steph/KD Warriors, big 3 Heat, Showtime Lakers, and the 60s Celtics. You could throw 90s bulls in there two if you think Pippen was MVP level himself, personally I think he was just below that.   If it's true that McHale made the KG trade with favor to Boston, and their was a better offer for Minnesota somewhere else, then he made the trade in bad faith, and it makes since that he's considered an awful GM"
In an all time greats list Dwight Howard &gt; Russel Westbrook
Dwight Howard was probably the best center in the NBA for a little while and I don't think anyone will care in 20 years
"Nothing against Wilt but I like how confident you are in your opinion despite never seeing Wilt or any of these guys play. You weren't even born yet. Where does all this confidence come from?   Wilt is undeniably one of the GOATs, but it'd be interesting to see him get defended by men his actual size that can keep up with his mobility, even young Shaq would give him trouble. Gobert. Marc Gasol. Wilt would struggle to box out Dwight Howard or Drummond.  I daresay though Wilt would still be a very good player, he wouldn't be as dominant."
"I give you 2017, but it‚Äôs not like he was supposed to win in 2015 against the 67 win Warriors with an injured Dwight Howard as his second best player. He played bad, but i wouldn‚Äôt particularly call it a choke when he played really well in these playoffs other than that"
Dwight Howard. He has played so long after his prime years that most people think of him as just a role player. The dude was a superstar at one point.
"If i had a 1 v 1 with spud webb, I'd look like Dwight Howard. Using that Reddit Fat for good use, finally!"
"He could‚Äôve kept the same form, but probably would have had to trade the 50 lbs of lean muscle he‚Äôs gained since then. Hard to keep the same form when your shoulders go from KD to Dwight Howard overnight."
I don't think people realize how ridiculously good Dwight Howard was in his prime
&gt;just care about winning is relatively new thing that started with maybe Cuban.  Mark Cuban literally made sure the Mavs couldn't contend in 2012 with his stupid hunt for Dwight Howard
"He is incosistent defender.  To say that Lebron is near perfect basketball player, its such casual thing to say. He also doesn't shoot that well, including free trows. And so far on defense, he can't guard all 5 positions lol. Could you match him with Duncan, Dirk or even prime Dwight Howard? No. He is not equal dominant player on both sides of the court. He has his peaks, but they where not every season there. Especially now, when he is old."
Kobe tore his achilles. Also u trade bynum for dwight howard 10/10 times.
Aaron Brooks fell off a cliff. So did IT. Dwight Howard. Derrick Rose for a while there but he's turning it around.
"&gt;He opted to not bring back Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Dwight Howard after the Lakers won in 2020.  The Lakers could not afford to bring that team back, as most of them got raises to leave.  McGee made as much as Gasol and Howard combined in 2021.  Green made more then Schroder, and provided far less.  Rondo got a 325% raise from the Clippers.  Pelinka is not a great GM, but bringing back the 2020 Champs was never an option."
His demeanour reminds me of KG/young Dwight Howard. The competitiveness and engagement of KG with young Dwight's positivity and happy to be here personality.
"Dwight Howard at his peak for sure. Westbrook was better for longer though, but overall I still give it to Dwight"
Dwight Howard by a country mile. It isn‚Äôt even close.
"Don't forget rookie Chris Bosh and Antawn Jamison. The following season rookie's Emeka Okafor, Josh Smith, Al Jefferson and Dwight Howard were added to the position as well. Howard and Jefferson both came in as PF's before transitioning to the center position a few years later. It was truly stacked back then."
yeah with a sliver of the offense. patrick beverly and old dwight howard wont pop off like curry and thompson
"And how much has that helped his team?   Clearly teams don‚Äôt need a ‚Äútop 5 defensive center‚Äù in a league where post scoring is almost entirely irrelevant, and you can just fill out the roster with big bodies.  If you‚Äôre a contender you‚Äôre better off with a dwight Howard or javale who can play defense and rebounding well enough for you to spend money elsewhere.    Turner is a luxury. While he may be better than those guys, he‚Äôs not 20 mil a year better"
Dwight Howard has more career points than Steph Curry. And Curry is already 33
"No but there‚Äôs a reason Dirk Nowitzki has a ring and Dikembe Mutombo doesn‚Äôt. Same with Rudy Gobert being ringless (&amp; medal less) and Dwight Howard only winning one as a back up. Magic Johnson is considered the greatest point guard of all time even though he was a black hole on defense. Defense is greatly valued but not in primary roles. You don‚Äôt win championships with defensive stalwarts as your best player unless they are equally adept on offense (think KG/Duncan/Hakeem) or an elite two way wing (MJ, Kobe, Bron, Kawhi). You can get lucky and get a few stops with bad to mediocre defenders or they can turn up the intensity to get by. Poor scorers don‚Äôt get hot and all of a sudden carry offenses in the playoffs."

"Dwight Howard was awesome for us. Hyped everyone up, joked with reporters, bought into the frosty freeze out. Really elevated the team's energy.

"&gt;Does Harden make the playoffs with the Rosters Westbrook had in OKC? Even if he gets bounced out in the first round. I personally don't think he does.  When did you start watching Basketball? James Harden has made the playoffs with bad supporting casts in his career, this isn't anything new, he's known as the #2 best floor raiser in the league for a reason.  &gt;Same goes for Dame who took the Blazers to the WCFs with CJ McCollum as his 2nd best player...  In 2015, James Harden took the rockets to a 56-26 record, with his second-best player Dwight Howard playing only 41 games that season. He went on to take the Rockets to the WCF that series averaging 27/6/7 on 62TS% that playoffs. He averaged 28/8/6 on 63TS% in the WCF. Dame, who you're praising for reaching the WCF in 19', got swept by the KD-less Warriors, blowing multiple double-digit leads in the Second half, averaging 22/5/8 on 55TS%.  &gt;lol, with Chris Paul on his team.....Chris Paul, arguably one of the best PGs ever  Yes, to take the greatest team ever assembled to 7 games you'll definitely need help, regardless in 19', when he took them to 6 games, Chris paul averaged 17/7/6 on 57TS% while shooting 31% from three, Harden averaged 35/7/5 on 59TS%. LeBron James the greatest player of this generation never took them past 5 games, and that was with one of the best pg in Kyrie, he got swept the very next season without help.  &gt;Luka averaged more points and more rebounds with a better FG than Harden this season.     What cherry-picked stats to point out lol. I'll be using a 2-year sample since a one-year regular season/playoff stats don't prove all that much  Luka Doncic: 28/9/9 on 58TS% &amp; 54efg% with 4TO in the past 2 seasons  James Harden: 30/7/9 on 62TS% &amp; 54efg% with 4TO in the past 2 seasons.  Harden is drastically more efficient, a better scorer and both are great playmakers."
"Shit didn‚Äôt even use the word good dumbass. It said ‚Äúwho would be a legend at the tail end of their career‚Äù you could say fuckin Dwight Howard, if you wanted.   Then it said ‚Äústar at the top of the industry in the midst of their prime‚Äù which makes you think. You could say someone like Kevin Durant, but KD is also nearing the end of his prime and even then only played 36 games in the regular season. It‚Äôs not just a clean cut answer.  Then 2 up and coming players clearly refers to players who are young but not superstar or even star caliber. Just players who you could see succeeding in the future.  If you don‚Äôt like the post, that‚Äôs fine. What the actual fuck is the use of publicly stating you don‚Äôt like the post? OP obviously had something on his mind he wanted to share with the community, to elicit responses, not whatever bullshit you came up with."
we dont know that. Dwight Howard also looked like a freak of nature at that age. a few years later he fell off completely.   not saying the same will happen to Giannis but its simply too early to tell.
"Nah, we need someone who has played on more teams, and teams with more volatile rosters. I think Dwight Howard will have a pretty insane list of former teammates if he keeps playing."
I don‚Äôt think the solution to the conundrum is truly that difficult. And has been solved by multiple high level teams.  Stop looking for one big that can do it all and get 2 guys that give you different looks. Zubac and Batum. Lopez and Tucker. Dwight Howard and Markieff Morris.

"1) Bill Russell was the only common link between the 57 and 69 Celtics. He had great teammates but he found a way to win with a bunch of different rosters.

I have never liked Chris Paul or Dwight Howard and I couldn‚Äôt tell you the reason why.
Dude played 3 minutes last season and got ejected for fighting Dwight Howard. Fuck his 'veteran presence' lmao. Should've been out of the league 5 years ago by normal standards.
1. CP3  2. Harden  3. Nick Anderson  4. Karl Malone  5. Dwight Howard
"Yes, again if that‚Äôs how you define amazing then every nba player is amazing. Nate robinson performing a dunk? Amazing.   Dwight Howard dunking? Amazing.   Luka step back three? Amazing."
dwight howard
Shaq and Dwight Howard shoot far better in practices too (80%ish iirc) and I wouldn't say their form is ideal.
"Shai Gilgeous Alexander will be a top 5 player in the league at some point - spicy  Immanuel Quickley is going to be the best player on the Knicks in 5 years and they will win a title (homer take) -spicy  I like Embiid but his game will not age well with his injuries, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up as vet Dwight Howard with a jump shot (Marc Gasol esque) - not spicy  Harden has never been better than Curry - debatable, but not unpopular  Oscar Robertson should be top 10 on way more people's lists - spicy  Reddit overrates efficiency and underrates volume scoring because a lot of people here didn't play ball and don't understand the value of scoring/staying on the court while fatigued - all of the ""Embiid for MVP"" discussions shows that they disregarded the fact Jokic played 100% of his games"
‚ÄúChu talking about dawg?‚Äù  - Dwight Howard
The one where Dwight Howard was allowed to hack away at him for five games
I mean the Bobcats/Hornets were literally 1 pick away from both Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis in different drafts...
"Shai Gilgeous Alexander will be a top 5 player in the league at some point  Immanuel Quickley is going to be the best player on the Knicks in 5 years and they will win a title (homer take)  I like Embiid but his game will not age well with his injuries, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up as vet Dwight Howard with a jump shot (Marc Gasol esque)  Harden has never been better than Curry  Oscar Robertson should be top 10 on way more people's lists  Reddit overrates efficiency and underrates volume scoring because a lot of people here didn't play ball and don't understand the value of scoring/staying on the court while fatigued"
"If Ben could make free throws, Kevin Huerter still would have destroyed seth curry, Harris still would have missed open layups, Embiid still would have had massive turnovers, Dwight howard still would have been unable to play without fouling someone"
Dwight Howard looks like Steph in an empty gym    Ben Simmons strokes like Reggie miller in an empty gym
"If you factor in size. Ayton has an argument for number 1, or number 2 behind Zion. Ayton has athleticism and height/length somewhere in between Dwight Howard and Shaq. [Here is his vertical](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664). He may not play athletically but he is very athletic."
So he‚Äôs basically like peak Dwight Howard.
There were some good ones from the theatrical era. Greens Cupcake dunk was dope. I liked Dwight Howard and nates stuff as well
"That's the peak Celtics, LeBron cavs pt1, Dwight Howard magic year. I think pistons were still also good"
"I think you're confused.   My entire point was you cannot compare players like Bill Russell to players nowadays because competition was so much weaker. If we could send Prime Dwight Howard or like Ben Wallace I'm sure they would have had Wilt numbers.   Therefore I would not include Wilt/Russell in whatever GOAT conversation. Players like them paved the way for better players so they should get mentioned but no where should they be accounted for actual discussion.  It's like before electricity and lightbulbs some guy probably invented the first quick way to light matches. Candles, torches, anything that needed an open flame and the guy made some fast ass matchsticks. It was probably very important that time but no way can you say whoever designed and invented that is the top 10 inventors of the world."
why is this just the same dwight howard putback dunk off a miss 10 times in a row?
"I don't know if he really put future first ballot HOF, multiple time DPOY and at the time Champion Dwight howard in his place. Especially after the whole getting tossed to the ground thing with no effort."
"Lakers can actually start Shaq, Karl Malone, Lebron, Kobe and Magic, with Kareem, Baylor, West, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash, Gary Payton and tons of other guys on the bench. lol."
"Perhaps you missed this part: ""the *57 players* in the USA basketball pool (not just the final roster) were subject to drug testing:""  [Here's the full list.](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) In addition to the final Olympics roster, it includes players like LeBron, AD, CP3, Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi, Paul George, Westbrook, Butler, Lowry, etc. That's pretty much a who's who of prominent American players in the latter half of their careers.  Also, you've got the next generation of superstars in Trae Young, Tatum, Zion, Donovan Mitchell; then there's the class of guys who used to be elite and might be especially tempted to juice to battle the effects of injury or general decline: Kemba, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, K-Love, John Wall, Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, and Dwight Howard. That's a whole lot of guys signing up for DUI checkpoints."
"So that he can check in for 30 seconds, fuck with Dwight Howard, and get ejected"
"We were on pace for the 1st seed before getting Gasol. We've had Odom and Bynum for years. We got vets who were past their primes, and we didn't win based off of sheer talent when every team we played in the Western Conference (Rockets, Nuggets, Spurs, Suns) were all incredibly talented in their own right.    And Lakers in '11-'12 were definitely not stacked. That was a team that desperately needed to be retooled since everyone was aging. If we got Chris Paul and Dwight Howard like we were supposed to, THAT would have been a stacked team"
"He gets paid to work out, have amazing courtside seats, have fun, talk to his friends, and possibly get into a game and punk Dwight Howard. Man is for sure living the life."
"We're talking about an empty gym, not in game. I've seen Shaq drain like 8 3s in a row  in shootaround. I've seen Chris Webber fucking around and draining 3s while sitting down. Dwight Howard is wet from 35 feet when he used to play random pickup games in the offseason.   Trust me, any NBA player can hit 35% from 3 in an empty gym."
"Defensive rating has a ton of noise. It also generally works better to evaluate a team‚Äôs defense or a particular lineup‚Äôs defense when they‚Äôre a significant enough sample size.  A single postseason is also far too small a sample size to reliably evaluate a player‚Äôs defense.  Trae hasn‚Äôt played enough to qualify for the active players‚Äô postseason offensive and defensive rating leaderboards. Or bball index‚Äôs postseason Lebron metric. Raptor recommends 1000 minutes at least and defaults to combining regular season and playoffs numbers (in which Trae has the 2nd worst defensive raptor, above only Bryn Forbes).  Even if you did look at just this past postseason, other defensive metrics don‚Äôt reflect as well on Trae. His d-Raptor of -4.6 was tied for 90th worst of 100 players. The only players that low who played multiple series (so one bad matchup didn‚Äôt skew the results) was Forbes, Conley, Monte Morris, Dwight Howard, and Rondo. He also was a -.5 in dbpm or 64th out of 91 which isn‚Äôt as bad but still isn‚Äôt average."
"Lebron, Alex Caruso, and Dwight Howard"
"Listen we all know what Simmons is, everything you're saying is widely understood and yet still his value is what it is right now. What you do in the regular season doesn't matter if you get shut down in the playoffs, both by the other team and mentally yourself.   You'd be hardpressed to find a team that is a great fit for a ball handler who is afraid to take a single jumper, you'd have to literally surround him with 4 shooters, like the Giannis or Dwight Howard strategy we've seen elsewhere.  &gt;he was already really good there.  This is what I'd push back on, not when it really mattered. When it really mattered he was non-existent. A ghost on the floor."
This happened to Dwight Howard who fortunately for him was absurdly good at basketball and made enough $$ for it not to matter that much but not everybody is that fortunate.
"Wilt was faster bigger and stronger than literally everyone in the current NBA. Wilt would run circles in todays league. Imagine a 7'1"" faster, taller and stronger Lebron coming after your ass on the fast break. Giannis is close to that and we consider him a freak, but Wilt is faster than him, taller than him and arguably stronger than both him and Lebron.   I can understand not comparing because of the rules and maybe the the limited amount of teams (which makes it harder to win imo) but thinking no one back then was athletically gifted is just crazy. 60's and 70's had extremely athletic people around the league.  Wilt, Bill Russell, Kareem, Artis Gilmore, Nate Thurmond, Walt Bellamy, Bob McAdoo and Bob Lanier is just a short list of 60-70's centers that would start over 90% of current leagues centers. That's not even the ones that were good centers, that's a list of the *great* centers and centers that weren't injury prone at some point in their careers that I could think off the top of my head. Hell, most of them had longer primes than Dwight Howard. There's plenty of other centers that could play or start in todays league during that time frame who were higher than average or had high peaks with short careers that I didn't list, which may have been warded off with todays medical staff. And that's just the centers! There's crazy amounts of forwards and guards that could play in todays era from 50's to 70's easy."
"Slava medvedenko, Sasha, Luke Walton, devean George, radmanovic, mike penberthy, Jordan farmer, derek Harper, Ron Harper, Brian shaw, Isaiah rider, glen rice, Rick fox, shaq, Andrew Bynum, Dwight Howard, Danny green, kuzzzzzzz, mo evans, Lamar Odom, Ron attest, Ariza, Shannon brown, Robert horry."
"I personally found Yao to be quite overrated.  He achieved nothing for the Rockets aside from first round exits even when healthy and you cannot be considered better than MVPs (Moses Malone and Bill Walton) or MVP calibre players (Dwight, Alonzo Mourning).  Off court he had a major impact but I wouldn't even consider him the biggest international what if in regards to injuries (that would be Sabonis).  Here are centers that are either already better or on track to be better than Yao aside from those mentioned above him if we don't count injuries.  David Robinson, Dwight Howard, Alonzo Mourning, Sabonis, Bill Walton, Joel Embid, Nicola Jokic, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, Patrick Ewing, Dave Cowens, George Mikan (debatable but id say historically has a much greater impact), Bob McAdoo (he played both PF and C kinda like Tim Duncan).  He's somewhere between 15-20 I'd say."
"Oden, Walton, Sampson, frig even Dwight Howard. Plenty of players who didn‚Äôt reach full potential due to injuries that had all-time great ceilings. Then you gotta think about the likes of Sabonis too."
He can‚Äôt learn from Harden. He doesn‚Äôt have the first step burst or deceleration that Harden has. It‚Äôs what makes Harden and Luka unguardable. It‚Äôs like telling Hakeem to train Dwight Howard. It‚Äôs something you have to be born with. You either got it or you don‚Äôt
"For sure I'm mixed on this because talking big shit adds more emotional stakes but these players are people too.   I just want them to know when I say things like Dwight has a baby dick, I don't mean Dwight Howard the person, just the player I see on TV who's actual character I cannot confirm our deny lololol."
Dwight Howard
"Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, and Deandre Jordan in 2012 is nutty. Gasol and Jordan are DPOY players, and Howard is on a decline from 3 straight DPOY."
"If the starters are prime LeBron - young Westbrook - prime Melo - prime Marc Gasol - prime Dwight Howard (BPA line-up), that would still leave a bench of prime Rondo - prime Ellington - prime Ariza - rookie AD - young DeAndre Jordan. Very solid bench.  Throw in some minutes for a rookie Bazemore and make sure 12-year-old THT, 14-year-old Malik Monk don't touch the court, and maybe even 17-year-old Kendrick Nunn."
"Lebron, Carmelo, Westbrook, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Trevor Ariza, DeAndre Jordan, Wayne Ellington. That's a very deep playoff team and it's not losing to anyone. Miles better than that Heat team."
"Dwight Howard has won a ring, but his reputation is tarnished by being one of the biggest divas of that time. No matter what people tell you, he does not claim the Superman nickname."
Shaq Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard. His HOF stock has gone up since playing off the bench
"it's definitely a debate. from my shallow dive into season stats just now i don't believe curry has ever led harden in scoring or assists until this year, where he led in scoring but not assists. keep in mind this includes houston where the best teammates harden had were (separate seasons btw): russ in a slump, cp3 (a pass first guard who averaged about 16 points in houston) and dwight howard in a slump. yes, curry wins more, but he has also consistently had an extremely good supporting cast. hell, curry could arguably be considered supporting cast for at least one of their championships.  i know i'm going to be downvoted for this but i don't care: taking steph over harden is like taking bill russell over wilt. if you value championships (team accomplishment) then steph is better, but if you compare the individuals, harden has a clear advantage."
Players with a greater legacy than George Karl on the ~~2012-13~~ 2021-22 Lakers:  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Carmelo Anthony  Dwight Howard  Rajon Rondo  Marc Gasol  DeAndre Jordan
"I think he'll be a great practice player for Westbrook's style of play ***and*** good in the lockerroom on a Dwight Howard level although DJ  should **BE GREAT** when it comes to cloning Rondo's unique skillset concerning young players.   I think the way DJ embraced the move to give his starting C slot to Jarrett Allen then the way DJ committed to teaching Jarrett very well/helped Jarrett get a bag, *is the exact type of teacher or mentor, which the Lakers will need this year* for Monk THT Nunn etc"
A certain Dwight Howard fills that role pretty well‚Ä¶
"If he does, don‚Äôt be like Dwight Howard and sign twelve 18 year contracts"
"I think age and injury will still be key. Even super teams can be letdowns. It‚Äôs almost kinda similar to the ‚Äò12-‚Äò13 Lakers. - One of the best players in Kobe (slightly younger, at the time, than current Lebron) - A prime and former DPoY Dwight Howard - A still effective Steve Nash entering the ‚Äò12-‚Äò13 season (though older, at the time, than current Westbrook) - Effective All-Star Pau Gasol - Former All-Star and DPoY Metta World Peace  Of course what did them in was chemistry, coaching, and injuries.  We don‚Äôt know if this upcoming Lakers team will work. Sure, AD and Lebron worked in the ‚Äò19-‚Äò20 season, but the former was hampered by injuries last season and the latter is gonna be 37 with a recent injury history as well.   Westbrook is great, but will he sacrifice a bit of his play style for the good of the team? The rest of the roster are just too old to move the needle individually or young, but not proven enough (outside of maybe Nunn) to accommodate the core three in a playoff series.  There‚Äôs a reason why most (if not all) analysts still pick the Nets over them.  The WB, AD, and Lebron trio would‚Äôve been fun‚Ä¶3-5 years ago. It might be fun this upcoming season. But it‚Äôs hard to gauge as of now."
you guys have dwight howard... what does DJ bring that dwight cant?
why... they have dwight howard
They just fixed a mistake by replacing Andre Drummond with Dwight Howard. Don't screw it up again
"&gt;though Simmons wouldn‚Äôt make much sense for them in my opinion since they don‚Äôt have floor-spacing centers to play next to him  This is why his value is low right now. The Sixers already have a floor-spacing center, an All NBA one at that, with Embiid and they STILL can't make it work (Given, Embiid is best in the paint but defenders have to respect his outside game too).    Any effective offensive lineup with Simmons basically requires the 4 other guys around him to be spot up shooters. When you have such specific needs to maximize his talents and prevent him from being a liability, the team loses the flexibility to field different lineups. It's much easier to do when the only non-shooter is your center, not your point guard (like the Magic in 2009 where the surrounded Dwight Howard with shooters)."
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that‚Äôs why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can‚Äôt have two non-shooting players on the floor in today‚Äôs nba. Ben also prob isn‚Äôt gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You‚Äôre not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
"I feel like he's in the same position Dwight Howard was in a few years ago with people saying he's washed. I personally think he could still be valuable in a lob threat role off the bench, but when you have KD, Kyrie, and Harden on your team, you don't even entertain the idea of a big man lob threat."
"How is Harden even remotely similar? Harden gave Houston his all and the era for that Rockets team was done. They tried Chris Paul, CP3, Dwight Howard. Harden dealt with the cheap ass Rockets owner not wanting to all in and go deep in the luxury when the KD Warriors existed.   Harden asked for a trade respectfully in the offseason. Rockets jerked their dicks around and didn‚Äôt do shit cause they didn‚Äôt want Harden to go to the Sixers. Why would they expect a top player in the league in their 30s to just sit through a rebuild?   Rockets got a good return as well. Y‚Äôall just want any excuse to hate on Harden."
I kept guessing Dwight Howard and I was not very correct
The amount of warriors games I've been to watching him and Baron Davis put up numbers while also playing no defense and watching Dwight Howard or someone absolutely brutalize Andris Biedrins... good times
Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard (2013) and CP3 are bigger FAs than Sixers have ever gotten in franchise history
Dwight Howard was a top 3 player in the nba until his back injuries. He was a  legit mvp candidate in 2011.
"He's as much a star at this point as Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap... Aja he used to be one but now isn't"
"I mean yeah the benches are roleplayers are all washed, but the big 3 for both teams are still gonna be fine.  Yeah, ad and Kyrie are injury prone, but you've still got LeBron, KD, harden, and even Westbrook (even if he isn't elite like he once was he's still very good)  Who cares if fucking Dwight Howard or Blake Griffin misses time due to injuries lol"
"Yeah this is something r/NBA hates to talk about. The 76ers starters really crushed the Hawks starters for the entire series. They won big and lost close, and in the losses it was the bench playing awful that let the Hawks back in the game. George Hill, Dwight Howard, really everyone off the bench except Matisse was horrible"
And you don't see Giannis showing the world that he's training. He's somewhere in Greece right now and we don't know what he's doing! Meanwhile you have Simmons showing the usual jumpshot routines even fcking Dwight Howard can do in practice. Like bruh
Ben Simmons is the new Dwight Howard
"It's not even a hard argument either.  **Offense**: Both are about even scorers, Valanciunas averaged 2ppg less but played about 4 mpg less. JV was a lot more efficient (61 v 48 eFG%) and shot 37% from 3, while Ja shot 30% on nearly 4 attempts a game. Ja is obviously the better facilitator. Per36 JV was averaging 22 &amp; 16! When JV was on the court Memphis was a top tier offensive team and posted a 126 ORTG. Ja was at 108.  **Defense:** Neither is an elite defender, JV gets exposed a bit more due to his position and lack of defending the switch. JV is an elite rebounder and great at boxing out though. Defenders shot on average 6% less at the rim when JV was defending, better than Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson, WCS and Mitchell Robinson.  **Advanced:** Almost every single advanced stat paints JV as a much more impactful player than Ja. JV has fringe all star level advanced stats, while Ja has role player advanced stats (WS, WS/48, VORP, BPM, PER, TS%, Net RTG, +/-).   I think Ja obviously has more potential and room to grow, while JV is probably around his peak, but I think JV at this stage in their careers was Memphis' more impactful player, while Ja was their vocal leader and star."
"non-traditional, eh?  let's do Dwight Howard at PG, Anthony Davis at SG, Marc Gasol at SF, Malik Monk at PF to show OP why he deserves to play, and Rondo at C     &gt; bring on IT  no"
"Yes, hall of fame Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrick, Dwight Howard, and Rajon Rondo. We‚Äôre in 2021, not 2013"
"Webber was a way way better shooter than Simmons is now over his first 5 years. That was in an era where people cared infinitely less about that too.  I get the other stuff more, but this is what separates Simmons from all these sorts of comparisons. Hes a Dwight Howard level jump shooter, thats just different to a lot of the optimistic comparisons he gets."
"Ben takes fewer shots but converts at a much higher rate, so its not that different in practice. In fact the only thing that probably keeps draymond close is Bens abysmal free throw shooting  Who confirmed that? Stephen A Smith? not too convincing to me honestly. If you have a source from a legit insider then ill probably give it a lot more consideration.  Also what do you mean it shows? Javale Mcgee looks like KD in practice but is obviously nowhere near that in the game. Dwight Howard is a knockdown shooter in practice but can barely make free throws in the game. You cant judge a players work ethic by just watching them in the game, its not that straight forward  Only proof I want is a legitimately credible insider getting info from a source that‚Äôs actually close to ben"
Second teams would probably be:  PG: Oscar Robertson  SG: Jerry West  SF: Julius Erving  PF: Charles Barkley  C: Wilt/Russell(whichever one you didn't pick)/Hakeem  vs.  PG: Steve Nash  SG: DWade(or Harden if you want better spacing)  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Dirk Nowitzki(in a few years will probably be Giannis)  C: uh..... Dwight Howard?
"Lakers also got Malik Monk, Dwight Howard, and Wayne Ellington, also has Aldridge even signed?"
Dwight Howard is probably more liked by the Lakers than the Magic.
"Yes, Ewing was a very good defensive center. Howard was one of the best. I would never argue Ewing was a better defensive player than Dwight.  Ewing was just so much better offensively, had more team success, Ewing's single best season was (at worst) only slight worse than Dwight's single best season, Ewing's 3 year, 5 year and 10 year peaks were all way better, and he had a lot more team success and it's not like he was playing with All Stars - Oakley, Starks and Mason were good but not exactly what you think of when you think ""60 win team"", Ewing just helped get them there."
"I mean all we're really saying is Harden is better at making free throws and 3s. I fully agree. But that's all it is. More points per game due to various factors. Percentages have been going up since hand checking (04 or 05?), and league focus on efficiency.   You also have to factor in who these players played with. Even comparing against league average. We can't isolate Harden playing with Chris Paul or Dwight Howard against Tmac with Mike Miller or Grant Hills missing ankle."
"Nope, 6 All NBA when 1 spot was reserved to centers means nothing. Dwight wasn't that dominant, it was rather the Magic system to exalts him.   1 finals MVP and an MVP playing against peak Kareem is much more important than what Howard did."
"&gt; Even still, is it crazy to value Jokic‚Äôs MVP over most of Dwight‚Äôs career?  I think so. Give me 6 seasons of prime Orlando Dwight Howard over one season of MVP Jokic every day of the week. Heck even Dwight's first stint with the Lakers and first year with Houston he was still a really good player (at least statistically). Jokic had a single best season better than any of Dwight's, but Dwight has had a lot more great seasons than Jokic.  I'm not saying Jokic doesn't have a chance to be the better player by the time he's done playing, he definitely does, but to value a single MVP season over a several year HoF level peak is crazy"
"What lol. Chicago didn't pull Rodman from Detroit. Rodman was practically banished from San Antonio when they got him  Chicago getting and rehabilitating Rodman was very similar to what the Lakers did with Dwight. He was viewed as a locker room cancer no one wanted to take a chance on when they got him (Even moreso than Dwight), even though both were technically still productive players (Dwights last full season before joining LA, which was 2018 he averaged 17pts/13rbs. He joined LA in 2020. Rodman averaged 7ps/17rbs)  Popovich himself said they couldn't find any team that wanted him until Chicago came along. Tell me all this doesnt sound eerily similar  Rodman  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1995/10/03/bulls-acquire-rodman-from-spurs/05ef2039-04da-4483-a7bd-84219c40417d/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1995/10/03/bulls-acquire-rodman-from-spurs/05ef2039-04da-4483-a7bd-84219c40417d/)  Howard  https://hoopshype.com/2019/08/19/dwight-howard-lakers-rumors/"
Dwight Howard
"My man, there were five seasons between the Lakers making the playoffs and Lebron joining. They had a stretch of 3(!) seasons without an all time great, going from Kobe to Lebron and eventually AD and now Westbrook.  Some of the notable guys who have played for the Lakers include:  Shaq  Kobe   Magic  Kareem  Wilt  Lebron  AD  Westbrook   Jerry West  Elgin Baylor  George Mikan  James Worthy  Michael Cooper  Byron Scott  Vets like Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash,   Plus guys who reportedly wanted to play there like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Chris Paul, etc.  I really don't think it's a stretch to say that they've been a blessed franchise. They have 17 championships, tied for the most. They had a handful of bad years because Kobe was at the end of his career and they were doing right by him. Then they botched their rebuild to an extent, until Lebron fell in their lap and they were able to get Anthony Davis for a bunch of guys who mostly don't even play for the Pelicans anymore."
They just lost Dwight Howard too
&gt; People who are excited about Dwight Howard joining their team are the definition of casual NBA fans. There's a reason he's being bought out. Sheesh  - op in 2019
"Eye test. Ben is a wimp. He‚Äôs not gonna be able to even be anything but a minor annoyance to Dwight Howard, Zubac, Gobert, Ayton etc who‚Äôd muscle him out of any play"
"I am 100% looking at this through homer lenses, but Ayton just finished his first playoffs with 15.8/11.8 on 65.8% FG% (I think NBA playoff record for single playoffs &gt;100 attempts).  He also held Jokic to 25/13.3/5.8 on 47.7%, which are still excellent numbers, but definitely his worst numbers in a playoff series. He was huge defensively against the Lakers and Clippers too.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be more than a rim runner/offensive rebounder on offense, but I firmly believe he has 1 Team All-NBA Defense potential. He won‚Äôt be a guy who can create his own shot consistently like Embiid or KAT or Jokic, but he can be elite at everything else on the offensive end‚Ä¶ maybe like a Dwight Howard.  Again, 100% biased take and I could be super wrong."
"I think they need to have a few qualities right now to make it that far;  * Currently 30+ and playing at a decent-good level (a younger player can but it becomes a pure gamble in guessing) * Comfortable playing a reduced and/or locker room roll * Loves the game deeply and wants to keep playing **or** loves the paycheck deeply and wants to keep playing  My first instinct was KD and/or LeBron but I'm not sure I see a world where either is comfortable coming off the bench or playing 10-15 minutes a game, or starting on a very bad team - I don't care if you're LeBron, I don't believe a 44 year old player is going to be a good starter on a good team playing high minutes.  In all I think Dwight Howard is the most likely. He's just about 36 and said earlier in the year he wants to play five more years. He clearly wants to win rings, and it feels like he's accepted small(er) roles. Still playing at a good level. Chris Paul is another one, though it remains to be seen if he's comfortable taking a bench role which I think is the biggest obstacle for most players staving off retirement."
Dwight Howard requesting a trade all the while acting like it‚Äôs just rumors and made up when basically everybody in the league knew he wanted out. Stan was just tired of the BS and the lies.
Fucking Dwight Howard attempted TWICE AS MANY 3s this season as Ben lmao
Dwight Howard and CP3 were joining the Lakers until stern veto‚Äôd it
Dwight Howard?
Dwight Howard trajectory
"Everyone says that, but what available centers out there give 80% of Allen‚Äôs production for $10 mil? There‚Äôs a couple ring chasing vets like Gasol and Dwight Howard, but they end up in LA or other contenders. Other teams end up having to pay guys like the Plumlees $10-$12 million per year, and they‚Äôre definitely not 80% of what Jarret Allen is"
With a prime Dwight Howard id hope you make it to the finals too bad you lost
Dwight Howard - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y08gvGpGCwA
You can‚Äôt run a pick and roll with no ability to collapse a defense when it‚Äôs engaged in the playoffs.  We saw him with Dwight Howard this season and it was awful
Why are you still saying this? Would you expect Dwight Howard to develop an outside shot when he was young? Because Dwight is a better shooter than Ben. For some people no matter how hard they try they will never develop a 3 point shot. See Andre Robertson for example. Ingram is a much better fit next to Lebron and he's still traded for AD. You are delusional if you think Ben Simmons will not be traded for AD if he's drafts by the Lakers.
He‚Äôs gonna have a Dwight Howard type resurgence in about 10 years Lol
"It‚Äôs not really - I just threw that in here cuz people wanted to comment on whether or not he was truly a scout. Doesn‚Äôt really matter - all that matters is his opinion, which in this instance, I agree with.   The guy has even less of a post game than Dwight Howard did."
"Top of the list would be Garnet, Bryant, McGrady, James, Jermaine O'neal, Rashard Lewis, Amare Stoudemire, Dwight Howard."
"I got 4 and 6 right. LeBron I feel like I vaguely knew that stat already, and not surprising it was him either. And I also remember hearing the one about Booker with his recent debut.  I was expecting some combination of Harden and KD in the first three, so I was especially surprised at the Dwight Howard one lol."
Don‚Äôt give Dwight Howard any ideas
Yep.  1. Trade a first round pick along with a player we won a championship with for player 2. Hailed as our savior at point guard 3. Flames out within the year 4. Acquire Dwight Howard 5. Replaced by a HOF point guard in his mid-to-late 30s 6. This will be fun!!
it's like Dwight Howard when people were like 'damn once he gets post moves it's pretty much over for the league'  but he never really did and then injuries derailed his prime.

"I dont get it, what about KD and Blake Griffin? You clearly don't mean starter in the east since you are including Dwight Howard."
"Kobe was one of those who recommended/cleared Dwight to re-join the Lakers in 2019   https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-10-28/lakers-kobe-bryant-dwight-howard-nba-impact  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2893078-jeanie-buss-kobe-bryant-recommended-lakers-dwight-howard-signing-in-2019     &gt; For him, I really believe he‚Äôs appreciative of the opportunity and I think he‚Äôs going to make a hell of an impact because of the new appreciation he has for playing the game.‚Äù  So I think he would have been pretty happy for the Lakers, LBJ, AD and Dwight too.   He also had recommended Dwight join the Lakers back in 2012  https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/basketball-news/kobe-bryant-wanted-dwight-howard-to-join-the-lakers-in-2012-nba-news.html   I mean Kobe patched it up with Phil, (who had called Kobe uncoachable,) and they went on to win two. So it isn't uncharacteristic."
"reading the part about kobe and dwight made me think about how kobe never got to see dwight win one for the lakers.   &gt;Sometimes, you wonder if Kobe can see the forest through the trees. He might be turning on Dwight Howard already ‚Äî you can see it ‚Äî a crucial development since Dwight could simply flee to Dallas, Houston or Atlanta next summer. Howard‚Äôs missed free throws are driving Kobe batty; he can barely hide his disdain on the court anymore. Same for Howard‚Äôs trying-too-hard-to-be-jovial routine and a general impression that Howard doesn‚Äôt live and die with the result of every basketball game. From what I heard, Kobe already played the ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know anything about winning championships!‚Äù card with Howard ‚Äî during a scrimmage last week, when the second team beat the first team partly because Howard checked out (he wasn‚Äôt getting the ball enough), followed by Kobe blistering him."
Jameer Nelson. Him and Dwight Howard were a great combo in Orlando for a few years even making to an NBA Finals.
"Don't forget how Rondo was feeding Howard a decent amount in the playoffs as well. Now that Dwight is back, we could see a lot more of that!"

"Well the height of those arguments was 2008-2010 and there's no doubt lebron was the best player in the league then. He was on another level.  I know it's annoying to rattle off advanced stats all the time but lebron absolutely destroys him in OBPM, DBPM, win shares, VORP, etc. Just to give you an idea, lebron tied Dwight Howard for 1st in DBPM and led the league in OBPM in 2009.   I know Miami lebron was the most efficient but 2008-2010 LeBron is the best basketball player I've ever watched imo"

"I think its both. Injuries really took a toll on his body and maybe delayed and stagnated his growth as a bball player. Also, I remember reading an article/interview of Bynum saying that basketball is more like a job rather than the love of the game.   But despite of all that, in his prime, there was a time where he was being compared to Dwight Howard. Man, he was on the conversation of being the best bigman that time. Its crazy! But I guess being in the league from a very young age didn't help his maturing."
"Dwight Howard.  &gt; Garnett and Howard have a history going back to their days battling each other in the Eastern Conference playoffs when starring for the Celtics and Magic, respectively. Garnett reportedly constantly taunted Howard by saying, ‚ÄúPaint your face, clown!‚Äù  https://nypost.com/2015/01/12/howard-dares-garnett-before-headbutt-whatcha-gonna-do/"
"Yes Chris Paul was a free agent and wanted to play with James Harden in Houston. Ended up opting into contract for one year to force a trade there.  Dwight Howard was good first two years but that‚Äôs irrelevant to what we‚Äôre talking about. Im saying plenty of NBA guys like the city.  Are you a jazz fan in Austin, Texas? Drive down to the west inner loop of Houston or Galveston beach one weekend."
Chris Paul and Westbrook chose to play in Houston?  Lol.  Dwight Howard was good in Houston???
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Westbrook (if you count him wanting to get traded here), Trevor Ariza, Eric Gordon, PJ tucker   Plenty of good NBA players choose to play here and enjoy the city. Tucker had his bucks championship party in Houston."
"I‚Äôd replace Shaq with Dr. J for dunking, Shaq wasn‚Äôt a very versatile dunker. Even among centers, guys like Dwight Howard could get higher and were more flexible. Shaq was just so strong that he could dunk over practically anybody (besides maybe Yao Ming or Gheorghe Muresan or someone of that stature)."
2012-2013 season. Lakers get Howard and Nash.  Lakers get off to a horrible start as they try to mesh. Nash is in and out of the Line up. Finally start to play well towards the end of the season. Came into the Warriors game having won 6 of 8. They actually look good. Pau and Dwight were finally clicking then boom. Kobe ruptures his Achilles. The start of a very dark 8 years.
"It crazy, I feel like Dwight Howard should be in rebounding and blocks. But his prime was so seemingly short."
Dwight Howard I guess   Jaylen Brown now   Sharife Cooper next üòà
Someone needs to interview Dwight Howard about those kids he was caught in that hotel with a few years back since we digging into basketball players personal lives outside of sports.
"Everyone always says this but I think that's far from a guarantee. The West was really good at the time between OKC, San Antonio, and the Grit and Grind Grizzlies. Plus if they were still planning on going after Dwight Howard, I think that probably would have still blown up in their faces even with Chris Paul instead of Steve Nash.  Imo the real difference is that having Chris Paul would have set them up way better for the post-Kobe years, and they would have been in much better shape to withstand the Dwight fiasco. With Paul as a Laker, they could have really thrown themselves in the mix for LaMarcus Aldridge in 2015 or KD in 16. But then that leads to the question of do they still get LeBron and AD in this timeline. And do we still get the 2018 Rockets? Does the Warriors run look different with some real competition in LA? There's truly a lot you can unpack with this what-if"
"Pau stepped up defensively against Dwight Howard, which is why he deserves a mention for FMVP at least, but Kobe was the best player in the series."
Mike D'antoni making an old team with Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol play a fast paced was head scratching.   Also making Pau Gasol a floor spacer and even starting Earl Clark over him for a few games drove me nuts.
"&gt; Look, people *want to believe* you can make a man drop by first pretending to move one direction and then actually moving another.  &gt;  &gt; It is part of the human condition. It is part of why NBA and any other sports league exists - to play fast and loose with the superstitious, idol-worshipping, and ego-maniac side of the public hivemind. It is about harvesting and reining in the smart apes' primitive aggression so they stare at a screen instead of burning things down. &gt;  &gt; When children stare open-mouthed at the TV where cartoon characters shoot colored beams from their hands, there is a little voice in their heads saying: *""If you are good enough, you can do transcendent, otherworldly feats"".* You can become *more than human*.  &gt;  &gt; What happens when the channel is changed to ESPN?  &gt;  &gt; ""This athlete can dunk after jumping from the free throw line and over a car."" (reality: he jumps over the hood, had a running start spanning the entire court which the commercial conveniently cut out, and had 7 failed attempts before).  &gt;  &gt; ""This athlete can break his opponent's ankles with his crossover."" (reality: his opponent loses his balance more due to exhaustion, accidentally tripping over himself and floor condition than due to being manipulated). &gt;  &gt; It is like wanting to believe Superman and five point palm exploding heart technique exists. We already got Dwight Howard wearing a cape. Next up should be Trae Young exploding people's hearts after dunking on them 3 times."
"I'm not a Boston fan, and Perkin's was good at his role, which was to defend bigs like Andrew Bynum and Dwight Howard.  That weren't many that could do it at the time, and there are even fewer now, due to the decline of big men in the NBA.  He played a very important role against the Lakers."
Pretty short list of 3x+ dpoy players  Ben wallace Dwight Howard Dikembe mutombo Rudy gobert   I‚Äôd be pretty surprised if he doesn‚Äôt end up first ballot
Dwight Howard
"No, he won because he had a much more impressive season than LeBron had (so did Dwight for that matter). He led his team - without any star players like LeBron had multiple of - to the best record in the East. A better record than LeBron had on a team that was favored to win it all from the get-go. Rose's Bulls even beat LeBron's Heat in 3/3 games that season.      Thibs' defensive schemes were great for a few years, but he had absolutely no idea what he was doing on offense. He barely even called plays at times. Rose was the offense of that team. Noah was still not the player he would become and only played 48 games due to surgery and lingering injuries. Boozer broke his hand just days before the start of the season. 38-year-old Kurt Thomas had to start and finish their games. Starting shooting guard Keith Bogans averaged 4 points per game (and might have been the worst starter of all time lol). His best teammate that year was Luol Deng - who played with a wrist injury all season. When on the floor, Rose was responsible for more than 70% of Chicago's offense per PTS/AST even though he was the sole ball handler of that team, clogged by defenders all the time. Still, he lead his team to the best record in the league.      Rose totaled more than 2,000 points and 600 assists that season. At the time, something only MJ (1988-89) and LeBron (2009-10) had been able to do during the modern era. While doing so he received 113 of 120 possible 1st place votes that year, totaling more points than 2nd placed Dwight Howard and 3rd placed LeBron combined. He totally earned it. Even his rivals on the Heat thought so:      *Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He‚Äôs playing well, like he‚Äôs the best point guard in the league and the best player in the league. He‚Äôs the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.*   \- Chris Bosh      *I think it's Derrick Rose, definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being first in the Eastern Conference - they're playing some really good basketball.*   \- LeBron James"
Dwight Howard after him Jaylen Brown
Dwight Howard. The year he went to the Finals with the Magic was one of the best NBA seasons ever.
The NBA player you're looking for is [Dwight Howard.](https://www-sportscasting-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.sportscasting.com/dwight-howard-is-a-snake-whisperer-except-for-the-ones-that-have-bitten-him/?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#aoh=16319055017922&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportscasting.com%2Fdwight-howard-is-a-snake-whisperer-except-for-the-ones-that-have-bitten-him%2F)
Dwight Howard has like 16 snakes
"You're wrong.  The Lakers went 0-2 and beat the Cavs easily twice that season. The Cavs lost two home games all year, one to the Lakers.  The Cavaliers couldn't guard Dwight Howard. You think Big Z was going to guard a frontline of Gasol and Odom any better? Gasol took it to Dwight in the 2009 Finals, you don't think he could handle Ilgauskas?  Come on. The Lakers matched up perfectly fine with those Cavs teams."
"Reminds me of the stat that Steve Nash missed less free throws in his 1,217 game career than Dwight Howard did in that 76 game season with the Lakers"
"Brave of you to say this on reddit, but you're right.  I think everyone likes to compare those Cavs rosters to GSW and LeBron's Heat teams.  Yea individually the guys on the cavs weren't great, but as a team they were. You had LeBron surrounded by shooters and guys who played good defense.  To your point, Dwight Howard with the magic is another example. No one says He carried that team even though he was like the only all star on the team. I think Rashad Lewis may have went, but it wasn't like he was avg 20pts a game.   And Dwight is not as good as LeBron. The thing that gets me about the whole ""LeBron carried bums"" trope is, that those fans turn around and say ""well his teammates sucks"" when he loses.  I really wish people go back and look at majority of the rosters in the NBA in the mid to late 2000s. Most teams didn't have multiple All stats. The cavs roster in the east actually stacked up well with the other rosters in the east.  Can't have it both ways. Can't say LeBron makes guys better, but then blame his teammates when the team loses.  Also Mo Williams was a good two guy for the cavs. Like he wasn't trash. Again, can people go judge the second best player of any any team during those Cavs runs and Mo's stats actually match up well."
"Here we go‚Äî  Let‚Äôs remind the people that the  Orlando Magic that year had Dwight Howard and guess who his second guy was, 5‚Äônothing J. Nelson   James was the best player in the East. He and his team ran rough shot over every eastern conf team that wasn‚Äôt Boston/Orlando."
"Don‚Äôt think you watched Basketball back then if that‚Äôs what you think. The Cavs had no answer for Dwight Howard and were built to beat the Lakers. They surrounded LeBron with 3&amp;D guys which is perfect for his ball dominant playstyle but they had no answer for Dwight Howard. Jameer Nelson, Rafer Alston, and that Mikael guy shot like 50% from 3 too.   Cavs won a playoff atmosphere game against the Lakers that season too."
The series would have been a sweep if the refs weren't calling tic tac fouls on Dwight Howard to help the Cavs lol. He was eating Ben and Ilgaukas alive. Those two were too slow and old to handle athletic prime Dwight.
"Very nice list.  And what a horrible time to live in, for watching the greats at fouling. Only Dwight Howard is in the top 20, at 20. Will he reach 19 next year? Eh, probably.  Wait, hold on. Dwight could jump from 20th to 12th next year. He fouls as much as he did when he played twice the minutes. I guess because fouling out = 6, no matter how fast or slow you do it."
"idk why but i consider 16-6-6 to be the lamelo statline.  trae young owns the 30-10+ games for me.  deandre jordan, dwight howard and robert williams are 7-14-3 block guys.  can't forget the bradley beal 35-2-3"
"Shaq vs Ben Wallace,  Wilt vs Steven Adams,  Adama Traore vs LBJ &amp; Dwight Howard vs Poku."
Dwight Howard if he would pay attention and learn how to do it.
Uhhhh... Terrence Ross for prime Dwight Howard? Yeah man
I‚Äôd definitely trade Jonathan Isaac for Dwight Howard
2 . x guard &amp; Lebron. It likely will be Westbrook/Bazemore/James/Davis/Howard or even Jordan. LAL played both Javale and Dwight two years ago.
Dwight Howard won DPOY in three consecutive seasons.
"‚ÄúIt starts with the D‚Äù  - said Dwight Howard, with a smirk"
Would Dwight Howard committing a foul on Te‚Äôa Cooper be considered domestic violence?
"I‚Äôve seen a comment where he was the best defender at his peak. When guys like BWallace, Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan existed.   Also, they massively overrate his 08 title contribution as if he‚Äôs the main guy.   KG is top 15-20, but I‚Äôve seen some idiots put him in the top 10 also so‚Ä¶ yea."
Dwight Howard talking about D
"Well, then you agree with Harden. We all agree then.   Being a 6'11 dude who moves like a guard, with a 7'6 wingspan and the strength of Dwight Howard isn't just like .... oh its kinda useful, but its not really what makes Giannis who he is.  Its the most important thing that makes him who he is. And he has taken that size and speed and turned it into one of the most dominant play styles we know today.  But without it, he's almost useless as an NBA player.   You give him Tim Duncan's body? He might not even make a starting 5.  You give him Harden's body? He's not in the NBA."
"So LeBron is the only all time great in history where his team isn‚Äôt allowed to build a roster? Kobe is allowed to get Shaq, Lamar Odom, Pau Gasol, Ron Artest, and Dwight Howard, but LeBron has to do it by him self? Lol"
He has Dwight Howard over Bynum though.  Is this all time list or Lakers stint list?  Either way this list is all wrong.
"NOLA has been a poorly run franchise since the Chris Paul days, think that has more to do with it than location. Also, Atlanta has done pretty well with FA‚Äôs for a mid-size market team. Joe Johnson, Demarre Carrol, Bogdanovic, Paul Milsap in his prime, Dwight Howard, etc"
"That's not true lol. Noah only made first team once in his whole career in 2014 lol. There were other stars that made first team in Lebron's time in the east for all those years like Dwight Howard, Dwade, and KG"
What happened to Dwight Howard already?
"That's *really* disrespectful to the Rockets.  They were a fantastic team that would have won it all at least once if the Warriors didn't exist. That's not because they were all scrubs except for Harden... I've seen LeBron come close to that level of carry job, and Harden did not play at that level. Players like PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza were both important cogs of championship rosters, Dwight Howard and CP3 are still very good players years later, and so on."
Javale mcgee and dwight howard&gt;&gt;&gt;marc gasol at least when it came to fitting on the lakers
You put 2020 Dwight Howard over 2017 Kevin Love lol  Also Shaq over Bosh? what
As long as prime Dwight Howard is playing for him.
"Not as good as Chris Paul but far better than pretty much everyone Harden played with barring Dwight Howard.   Warriors had a much deeper and more importantly, consistent, bench too."
"We've kinda had some notable missing players for the 50 Greatest list at the time so I have no doubt we will have the same issue for the 75 Greatest list.  Guys like Bob McAdoo, Joe Dumars, Gary Payton, Alonzo Mourning, Dennis Rodman, Bob Lanier, Sidney Moncrief, and 'Nique missed out on the top 50. Now you have guys like Chris Bosh, Bron, Wade, Melo, Dwight Howard, CP3, Durant, Curry, Westbrook, Kobe, Pau Gasol, Dirk, KG, Nash, Kidd, Duncan, Giannis, Kawhi, Harden, Pierce, Ray Allen, Iverson, etc., that can easily make cases for their spot in the top 75.   That's over 25 players that could be added to the 50 already cemented. And I doubt they would leave out some previously in the top 50, even if times have changed and certain players' legacies are looked at differently in modern context (i.e., guys like Hal Greer, Billy Cunningham, Dave Bing, Dave Debusschere, Bill Walton, etc.).  I don't envy the people who would be tasked to vote the 75 greatest players for this upcoming anniversary."
Bruh what? Yes I think Dwight Howard would want an extra million dollars. Do you maniacs hear yourselves? Every single one person in the NBA wants an extra million dollars.
"(Posted in an Allen Iverson crossover highlight post)  &gt; Look, people *want to believe* you can make a man drop by first pretending to move one direction and then actually moving another.  &gt;  &gt; It is part of the human condition.

Not surprised. But he should be thankful for Dwight Howard
not if dwight howard has anything to say about it
Dwight Howard is absolutely getting on it. He‚Äôs probably gonna be higher than Jokic.
"Uhhhh this comment is wild.   Kawhi is 100% on this list. He‚Äôs a 2x FMVP and won a DPOY.   Dwight Howard won three DPOYs and was the consensus best center in the game for half a decade. He will be on this list.   And you don‚Äôt think Russell Westbrook is even ‚Äúin the conversation‚Äù? He‚Äôs widely viewed as a top 10 point guard of all time, some say top 5. Russ is on this list for sure.   I think Carmelo Anthony makes it, but it‚Äôs fair to say he‚Äôs questionable. Davis I agree with you, could go either way."
"Allen Iverson   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Chris Paul   Damian Lillard   Dennis Rodman   Dirk Nowitzki   Dominique Wilkins   Dwayne Wade   Dwight Howard   Gary Payton   Giannis Antetokounmpo   James Harden   Jason Kidd   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Kevin Garnett   Klay Thompson   Kobe Bryant   Kyrie Irving   LeBron James   Manu Ginobili   Pau Gasol   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Reggie Miller   Russell Westbrook   Stephen Curry   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Tony Parker   Tracy McGrady   Vince Carter"
"2011 Dwight Howard wouldn‚Äôt give a shit, he didn‚Äôt shoot unless it was a dunk anyways."
"&gt; You think Dwight Howard will give a damn about a mid-season tournament?  Absolutely, he has 78 children to support and that can't be cheap."
Most of his teammates are washed up vets who‚Äôs gotten hundreds of millions in their careers  You think Dwight Howard will give a damn about a mid-season tournament
"It was stupid, they got him to stop Dwight Howard even tho it was Orlando's insane unsustainable 3 point shooting and peds which beat us the season prior, ended up not mattering as LeBron fucked up his elbow and disappeared during the Boston series"
"Dwight Howard is a fragile snowflake and cost himself $1M.  The Lakers wanted to do him a solid by giving him a small raise over previous year but they needed to sign Gasol first and then sign Howard over the cap (would have been about $3.5M or something, like $1M more). If they signed Howard first, this would have prevented them from signing Gasol. Because Howard read this as they wanted Gasol more than him, he signed with 76ers immediately for vet-min."
Steve Nash's team is also great:  * PG: Steve Nash * SG: Kobe Bryant * SF: Vince Carter * PF: Dirk Nowitzki * C: Shaq  2nd team:  * PG: Jason Kidd * SG: Joe Johnson * SF: Shawn Marion * PF: Pau Gasol * C: Dwight Howard  3rd Team:  * PG: Kevin Johnson * SG: Michael Finley * SF: Ron Artest * PF: Dennis Rodman * C: Amar'e Stoudemire  4th Team:  * PG: Goran Dragic * SG: Michael Finley * SF: Josh Howard * PF: Antawn Jamison * C: Chris Kaman  5th Team:  * PG: Tim Hardaway * SG: Nick Van Exel * SF: Hedo Turkoglu * PF: Danny Manning * C: Shawn Bradley or Juwon Howard
Tbf. Dwight Howard came with a similar reputation and warnings only the year before. And the Lakers were the first team to convince him to play within a role and it was successful.   I know the situations aren‚Äôt 100% the same but there was some reason to believe it could be different.
"&gt;‚ÄúI was never offered a deal from the Lakers,‚Äù Howard explained.  &gt;‚ÄúAt one point I did, so that‚Äôs when you saw the infamous tweet,‚Äù said Howard with a smile. ‚ÄúI really thought I was going back, but there was no offer. I understand it‚Äôs a business, the Lakers did what they felt was in their best interest and I‚Äôm just very thankful for them giving me the opportunity to come back to LA and have the opportunity of winning a championship.‚Äù  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/04/dwight-howard-on-tweet-lakers-never-offered-me-a-contract-but-i-thought-they-did/  &gt;Lowry is a fucking 35 year old often injured guard who wanted a 2 year max. Trading for Lowry would have been the dumbest desperation move anyone could make. The asking price for him was insane.  As opposed to trading for Westbrook who has 2 years left on his supermax contract and can't shoot plus needs load management as well."
Dwight Howard?
PG - 2011-2013 Russell Westbrook   SG - 2005-2007 Dwayne Wade  SF - 2005-2013 LeBron James  PF - 2005-2009 Amare Stoudamire  C - 2009-2011 Dwight Howard
"Because Shaq is an all time great and brought early success to Kobe‚Äôs career. That made all the difference. LeBron and KD got drafted to bad franchises and stayed for a long time and even extended their rookie contracts. Garnett wasted his entire early career on bad timberwolves teams that basically did nothing in the playoffs except for that one WCF appearance. He is often criticized for not leaving earlier. A team with prime Shaq and Kobe with the goat coach and solid role players is also a superteam. LeBron and kd don‚Äôt have that luxury of attracting superstars to Cleveland and OKC. The lakers brought in prime Shaq. And then just 3 years after Shaq left, they were able to get pau gasol, Ron artest, and Dwight Howard. Playing in LA bring its own advantage of attracting talent."
"*Lakers proceed to acquire Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan in the year of our lord 2021*"
"Dwight Howard,he could of been one of the greatest centers of all time"
Dwight Howard
I know Dwight howard has had a great career and everything but I always thought he lacked the focus to really reach his potential. But there are names on this list I‚Äôve seen that were better examples. I‚Äôm just adding one I didn‚Äôt see.
"Dwight Howard has to be pretty high on this list, though he‚Äôs certainly not in consideration for the number one. With that short neck, he‚Äôs functionally 7‚Äô tall since his shoulders are where a 7 footer‚Äôs are. Massive power, incredible athleticism. Fast, agile, amazing reach, unbelievable motor, made jumping out of the gym look effortless. Dwight was super special.    I think the most genetically gifted NBA player of all time is Kareem or Durant. Lebron‚Äôs top 3 but only beats either if we‚Äôre counting his intellect and natural charisma for leadership as genetic advantage. Kareem and Durant have perfect bodies for basketball."
Dwight Howard
nah bro it was all him. He's younger than Dwight Howard right now. He could be in the league if he gave a shit. He's 7 feet tall and highly skilled.
No mention of Dwight Howard?
- Ben Simmons  - Shaq (to a certain degree. watch his interview with Kobe)  - Ron Artest  - JR Smith  - Starbury (at least when he was with the NBA)  - Kyle Kuzma  - Prime Dwight Howard  - Latrell Sprewell  - Wilt Chamberlain (was more concerned with extracurriculars and stats more than titles and being a good teammate. He could‚Äôve been more better than he already was)  - A lot of the 70‚Äôs players. (Jesus that‚Äôs a lot of coke.)
Dwight Howard
The amount of people that aren‚Äôt understanding what a fucking freak Wilt was. This was Dwight Howard levels of muscle but somehow faster/stronger/ jumped higher.
Dwight Howard gonna be in them cheeks
"What???  Dwight is an amazing rim protector and scoring on him is not easy. In order for what u said to be true, kyrie or Harden would have to be taking mid range or 3 pointers contested by dwight Howard. He is athletic and quick on his feet.   Melo I understand. They can score on him easily.  Now. Since you wanna say ""if kyrie or Harden get switched to Melo it's an easy bucket.'  Pls tell me wtf happens when lebron , ad, or west Brook get switched onto any player on the Nets who isn't kd or Harden üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  Nets in 6 my ass   Nets are my team in the east but the lakers are just better.   Only thing Nets do better is shooting. But we just saw the last 2 nba champions not be great at shooting. It's abt more than shooting."
If Dwight Howard had Allen Iversons frame
"Cam is much more like Dwight Howard, especially corniness wise"
"Fun fact, 5‚Äô9 Nate Robinson has blocked Shaq, Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, and Lebron in his career"
To his credit though steph is a pretty good rebounder for a guard he has a couple of highlights outrebounding bigs like dwight howard
"Athletically, Wilt was a bigger, stronger, more athletic version of prime Dwight Howard. The only guy who's ever been in his stratosphere is Shaq.  Wilt would be much more athletic than every other big in the NBA. Embiid is much more skilled, but it was Wilt who ran D1 track and high jump."
"Expanding to two years would do wonders for Washington, since we‚Äôd get to add Michael Jordan and Moses Malone.   With just one year we‚Äôve got:  - Russell Westbrook  - Mike Miller  - Paul Pierce  - Charles Oakley  - Dwight Howard  Bench: Isaiah Thomas, Mike Bibby, Trevor Ariza  Prime Westbrook+Pierce+Howard is nice, but yeah this team could really use Jordan and Malone to be contenders."
"Nunn who can easily average 18 ppg and Melo who can easily avg 18 ppg.. with dwight Howard and Jordan on the bench...  Also its not like u can't alternate Westbrook, ad , and lebron minutes.. its not like all 3 must come of the floor at the same exact time .. its not like all 3 have to play at the same time LMAO..  they start games and close games.. but in the middle u can alternate ur players....  Only way Lakers fall that low is with serious injuries...you do realize lebron is now surrounded by shooters and 2 super stars ? lmao.. he will be so rested playing with Westbrook that he can be explosive almost anytime he wants.. also.. good luck stopping Lakers in transition.. and I think u also forgot they have a defensive coach who had the #1 defense despite both star players missing tons of games..   Lakers will be 1st seed."
"Not that old but I found quite good ""Melodrama"" and ""Dwightmare"" for Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard when they request a trade from their team (the Nuggets and Magic respectively)."
The reason Kevin Durant signed with GSW is because the Warriors lost to the Cavs in 2016.   The reason the Warriors lost to the Cavs is because Draymond got suspended.   The reason Draymond got suspended is because he lost his temper against OKC.   The reason Draymond lost his temper against OKC is because they were down 3-1.   The reason they were down 3-1 is because KD was beating them.   The reason KD was beating them is because Steph got hurt.   The reason Steph was hurt is because he was rushed back against Houston.   The reason he was rushed back is because they were struggling against Houston.   The reason they were able to struggle against Houston is because Houston made the playoffs.   Houston wouldn't have made the playoffs without Dwight Howard on the roster.   Dwight Howard was on the roster because Kobe abused him.   The reason Kobe could abuse him was because he was traded to LA.   The reason Dwight Howard went to LA is to have a chance to beat the Miami superteam.   The reason the Miami superteam exists is because LeBron left Cleveland.   The reason LeBron left Cleveland is because Delonte West slept with Lebrons mom.   SO   KD went to GSW   Because Delonte West slept with LeBrons mom.
Dwight Howard
"Buying out Dwight Howard benefited the Grizzlies.  CJ Miles was going to cost 8.7. Traded for Dwight Howard who cost 5.6. Bought D12 out for 3, saving 2.6. Total savings 5.7 million, in a year that they were worried about going over the cap, IIRC."
"I‚Äôll take Kobe dunking over a future DPOY Dwight Howard who‚Äôs actually facing him, any day."
Already have Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan plus AD
"wait, when did Dwight Howard learn how to shoot?"
Dwight howard and AD?
"Some of them are like 6‚Äô8-6‚Äô9, and that‚Äôs NFL measurements, I‚Äôm positive a guy like Jonathan Ogden would be called a 7 footer if he was a basketball player. He‚Äôs the same height barefoot as Dwight Howard and KD.   But yes generally NFL linemen are 6‚Äô3-6‚Äô6 which is ‚Äúregular people tall‚Äù."
"When Dwight Howard left the Magic I remember once throwing out T(i)aco Quitter, with T(i)aco in reference to him being obsessed with junk food to boot."
The real question is how did you get 49 rebounds playing with Dwight Howard lmao
I remember when Dwight Howard took what would have been my 50th rebound in 2k15. I can see that mf holding that shit above his head
Problem was that those 3-5 years were when Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard were also playing their best defense of their career.
"Let's see, dwight Howard, Paul pierce, and every free agent ever. Oh also giannis and kawhi if it counts"
Might be nostalgia goggles but 12/13 for me.   I'm having trouble seeing the total fit of the 21/22 Lakers still but I was salivating at the idea of Nash running the pick n pop with Gasol who is also an excellent passer and having the option of passing out to Kobe to do some damage or a Dwight Howard in the dunkers spot.
DAJ is also better than Dwight Howard in terms of catching lobs and rolling on P&amp;R.
"I remember when we had Deron Williams before his fall from grace. There was big rumors connecting Dwight Howard with the Nets. I thought they could get us a ring together at that point.  I was almost killed by a big ol truck during that off season, and as I skidded off the road I thought‚Ä¶‚ÄùI‚Äôm never gonna see Dwight and Deron team up :‚Äô(‚Äú haha"
"I think Deandre is in the category ""league changed and pulled the rug out from underneath his feet"". Dwight, Hibbert, Whiteside etc.  He was good up until the Warriors woke up, so to speak. They started scheming around him and getting him exposed with movement and shooting, then the rest of the league followed and made it hard for him to fit in.  Deandre is/was a really mobile and athletic big man for his time, but his feet has always been quite slow so the offenses and defenses today don't suit him.  Even Dwight Howard has ""struggled"" for a while now, just because his feet aren't that quick even though he's still good. But that's more a testament to his incredible defensive IQ, and Deandre obviously doesn't have that."
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
Someone in here said Dwight Howard. I just felt like I needed to say that out loud because of how insane that is.
I see him as a worse asset than Dwight Howard at this point.
"Below average? LMFAO. Man lists Dwight Howard, Carmelo, and Nunn and thinks they're better. Aite, we'll see next season."
"The guy had 15 total goaltends in 19 seasons played. Not only that but the majority of those were in the first couple of years of his career. 12 were in the first 6 years of his career, for the remaining 13 years he had 3 total. That tells all you need to know about how skilled he was at blocking shots. For comparison, Dwight Howard had 16 goaltends this past season alone. Sure there were probably some goaltends Timmy committed which were not called here and there (conversely some of the ones he was called for could have been incorrect or very borderline) but overall, for him to be as prolific of a shotblocker for as long as he did and still average less than 1 goaltend per season just shows how not only does he time his blocks near perfectly, but rarely even puts the ref in the position to make that tough judgment call in the first place."
Reminds me of Dwight Howard free throw practice videos
Could you consider Dwight Howard in this conversation?
"They‚Äôre both athletic freaks (hell, anybody in the NBA is an athletic freak to me) but Dwight is way way freakier. Athletically speaking, Dwight Howard was the total package in his prime. That‚Äôs why I got so mad watching him. I can‚Äôt help but think about what he could have been if he really cared. And it‚Äôs a testament to his abilities, because he did all that (Future HoF enshrinement coming) and I truly believed he wasn‚Äôt getting everything out of his abilities."
"I mean to be real they would just cut his ass, he‚Äôs like the 14th or 15th man on a minimum, the whole idea behind signing him at all is he can help give regular season depth mins to the center position where AD doesn‚Äôt wanna play full time (regular season especially), Gasol is barely good for 5-7 mins a game if that he was looking p washed last year, then you got Dwight who I want to start and I think will but he can‚Äôt play 38mpg and be effective anymore.  I expect it‚Äôll be Howard at 20-25mpg, Gasol playing 5-7 and then Jordan playing 3-5(depending on if they play AD at center that game he might not even play). If he‚Äôs demanding to start especially over Howard who was clearly missed last year I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll make it through training camp. He looks about as washed as Gasol maybe worse since he doesn‚Äôt have the skillset that Gasol has."
What‚Äôs the Dwight Howard effect?
"Bargnani was (is still?) the worst rebounding 7ft in the history of the league.  There was a near perfect correlation between minutes played and the team's defense... and it wasn't a positive one.  'The Dwight Howard Effect' at Sloan, incidentally, showed that Bargnani was so far off his man so often, it didn't even count as 'defense'.  And despite being one of the Cs with the most minutes played, he didn't even qualify for their measurements.  People don't grasp how bad he was.....  he was given the greenlight to shoot, had coaches fired and hired for him, never saw any accountability, while Colangelo was trying to protect himself... so people see ""A 7fter who could shoot 3 and score 20?"" sounds like a fit in today's game.  But its so far from that."
&gt;DeAndre Jordan admits he always wanted to play with... Dwight Howard.
Prime Dwight howard&gt;prime Ewing. Howard was incredible in his prime but I think everything post magic has made people forget that. (And Bill simmons has been trying to defame this man for a decade for beating his Celtics in the playoffs)
I still remember him hitting the game winner over Dwight Howard in Houston lol

Dwight Howard was feasting on the reserves
"In 2009 I went traveled to Boston to check a playoff game against the Magic, I had seats right next to the court and got really early to catch the warm up drills.     The first one I got to see was Dwight Howard, he was there shooting free-throws with no other than Patrick Ewing, at some point he decided to amuse the rival fans by shooting from the 3-point line, he got close to us and did like 5-10 attempts.  prior to every shot he would pass the ball to one of us, and ask to give the ball a kiss for good luck (he didn't make a single one by the way)... Anyway, first time I've seen somebody with gigantic shoulders, it was so surreal to see that up close. he seemed much leaner in TV.  After that, I saw Ray Allen on the opposite side of the court.  he was practicing a drill with a coach where was running around the 3-point line, somebody will pass him the ball and his coach would try to cover him (just basically stand in front of him with his arms up).  I saw this dude hit 23-25 shots non-stop.  it just makes me realize how good these guys are when they are not facing NBA level caliber defenders."
Good luck convincing Dwight Howard and Carmelo to let Russ take their rebounds
"I'm 100% a nephew despite being old enough to be able to hum the entire NBA on NBC theme, but man Dwight Howard actually impressed tonight"
"@ Work just box score peeping. Poole very nice, Dwight Howard wtf? Is he just feasting on back ups right now?"
I got to watch warm ups at a Wolves game once. Dwight Howard was on the opposing team and seeing him up close was the most insane shit. His shoulders like two enormous watermelons.
Dwight 'Andre Drummond' Howard üòÇ
"I feel like a lot of fans want to believe this, even though that's really only a small part of why players want to go to the Lakers. There's lots of cities which would be amazing to live in if you were a young multimillionaire, I really don't think LA is *that* much better than every other city. For instance, when Shaq signed with the Lakers he kept his home in Orlando because he said he loved that city so much.   What I think people overlook is that the Lakers' brand is their real selling point, much more than Los Angeles is. The Lakers always have the most attention on them, even when they're bad. They're the most well known NBA franchise around the world, and they're iconic because of their history and everyone who has played for them. And that legacy is something they built through great ownership in Dr. Jerry Buss and great management in Jerry West. That's what delivered the Lakers 15 Finals appearances and 10 titles from 1980-2010.   But part of the Lakers' brand is that they are *always* willing to take big swings and go all in if they think they can win. It doesn't always work (like when they traded all those picks and players for Dwight Howard and Steve Nash in the same summer), but they're never afraid to take those gambles. Their pursuit of Shaq (since you're a Magic fan) is a prime example of the Lakers being willing to do what other teams are not.   When Shaq was a free agent in 1996 there were no max limits on player salaries, so a team with a player's Bird rights could literally offer them anything they wanted. That meant it was impossible for anyone to outbid Orlando for Shaq just so long as the Magic were willing to pay what it took. The Lakers, meanwhile, needed to pre-emptively dump a lot of their players just to be able to make Shaq any kind of competitive offer, as they were constrained by the salary cap while Orlando was not. And yet, amazingly the Lakers wound up offering Shaq more money than Orlando did, with the Magic notoriously lowballing Shaq to try to get him for a discount. All Orlando had to do was simply offer Shaq more money, but they refused to do so, so the Lakers got him instead.   That's exactly the kind of thing that the Lakers' brand is built on, not only because it displayed that willingness to take a huge risk to try to win, but because it paid off by launching a dynasty which added to their mystique. So pass it off as it just being because of Los Angeles if you want to, but the Clippers have been in LA for almost 40 years and just this year finally made it past the second round for the first time. The location definitely helps, but it's not the only thing going for the Lakers. It's not even the main thing that draws players to them."
"Technically it‚Äôs a dunk if it is from above the rim. Dwight Howard did it for Superman dunk and Blake Griffin did it for Kia dunk.*    *i could be wrong about one of these, its been a while since I thought about the dunk contest"
"would have to be a star center for the Hornets just to make us a playoff force... especially needs to be able to carry a team defensively. One of these guys might get us in the mix but not favorites... Alonzo Mourning? Dwight Howard? Joel Embiid?   Short of prime Shaq,  nobody is getting us past Brooklyn."
"It's much easier to build a team around Shaq than it is Lebron. You won't find another center like Shaq, whereas you could find a lesser version of Lebron here and there.  Case in point, watch the series Lebron and his team got dominated by Dwight Howard + shooters. Lebron is not going to provide the kind of defensive presence Shaq can."
Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol got left off the list with Horry LOL
"A few years back, a good friend of mine had dang near courtside tickets to the warriors and invited me to a game against the Hornets. Dwight Howard was on the team at the time, and is one of my least favorite players. We got to the game well early and were in our seats watching the guys warm up, so i decided to throw a little fan-banter at Dwight. Nothing out of line, your typical 'hey batter batter' kinda stuff. Anyhow, at one point Dwight just turns around and looks me right in my face, and i dont know why it took me this long to realize this dude is a fucking behemoth of a man. I felt my balls shrivel right up into my stomach, this dude is fucking big beyond reason or need. Needless to say that was pretty much the end of my shit talk for the day."

Dwight Howard
Prime Dwight Howard maybe? Now‚Ä¶maybe Zion?
I made kyrie my starting center on 2k19. I made it to the nba finals but I couldn‚Äôt hang with Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard won 3 DPOYs based solely on shoulder magnitude alone
Like maybe from a guy with [five baby mommas](https://www.sportscasting.com/you-wont-believe-how-many-kids-dwight-howard-has-fathered/)?
Lmao prime Dwight Howard was a monster. He was like a god among those other centers. I don‚Äôt rlly like him as a person very much but I admit that he was a phenomenal player and injuries ruined something great.
"On the bench with Grayson Allen, Dwight Howard and Meyer Leonard"
They did have to work a lot on that back when shit like Dwight Howard jacking up 3s automatically when you passed to him got really bad but if the human is controlling every player that's not generally an issue.
"I feel like player empowerment really only extends to the top players though. They seem like they get to do whatever they want and teams will bend over backwards to keep them happy.  Max contract players and good young players get theirs while the ""middle class"" of the NBA is dwindling and good vets are chasing MPEs, TPEs, and minimums before they even hit 10 years played. Drummond just signed with the Sixers for the minimum - yes he's not an all star but he's 28 and already a minimum player, something Dwight Howard was for us last year at the age of 34.  It seems like if you aren't a star, you're a journeyman these days, which I don't think is ""empowering"" at all."
"How many times do we hear ‚Äúbut can you play him in the playoffs when it matters‚Äù about a centre? Even the DPOY Rudy Gobert hang against the small ball Clips. But DA was asked to do so many different things during this playoffs, and excelled. The second round showed just how valuable he was because the Suns could play single coverage on Jokic which meant other guys were less effective. Jokic still put up great numbers, but he was less efficient than his regular season numbers for sure. Just look at the difference between Nurkic in round 1, to Ayton. Have to give this guy the max, the fact that I‚Äôve seen a comment that says this guy is replaceable by Dwight fucking Howard is laughable."
"you mean because of antivax stuff, right? Like, that's where it stops being sports hate and starts being literal human resentment. I think there are a big fraction of r/nba denizens who are sitting the vaccine thing out and have zero problem with Wiggins, Irving, Isaac, or any of those guys.  In terms of basketball, everyone thinks **Dwight Howard** is a clown at best, and an insufferable moron at worst. Does anyone stan for Dwight Howard? Kevin Love is probably up there, too."
"Dwight too.  He had started missing time the previous year with back and shouder issues.   Prime Dwight could was a one man top ten defense, with the Magic finishing 5th, 6th, 3rd, 1st and 3rd during his prime seasons there.  This was despite starting mostly defensive liabilities in Redick, Alston, Nelson and Turkoglu without a lockdown guy on the squad besides Howard.  With multiple players capable of carrying an offense and a team that finished top ten on offense and bottom ten on defense a healthy Howard was the most important piece of the puzzle imo."
Dwight Howard was unquestionably better than Pau at their peaks. Not really debatable.
"I actually think he'd rip the league open with a high volume of C minutes.  He's strong as anyone in the league aside from maybe Embiid, and a blur with the ball for someone his size. Give him the ball in the high post with 4 shooters and let him drive (and kick) on offense and let him go full Polamalu with 4 wings that can switch everything on the perimeter.   Hoarding that many wings to test it is a really tough ask especially since they're already more or less capped, but I think the best Milwaukee roster would be one where you have Brolo in the Dwight Howard role to beat and bang with other true meaty 5s but by and large I think you'd see the most dynamic 2 way team ever if you had Giannis and 4 spacers."
"Fair, Ayton improved a ton last year and one could hope he becomes a max player over the course of the deal but he needs more polish on the offensive game and that doesn‚Äôt always come eh Dwight Howard. He‚Äôll still sign the max but fair on the gm to try and salvage some cap space"
Dwight Howard over Pau   hahahahahahahahahaa
"People calling Paul soft, he made Dwight Howard a marshmallow man in comparison.  Came back a better man for round 2."
Curry couldn't even make the playoffs. All he had to was beat the grizzlies. He had a all-star dpoy player with him.   What team has lebron beat on the east that had a 2xmvp and a dpoy player? None. Lebron couldn't beat Dwight Howard magic. Struggled against an old Celtics team with his super team. He got pushed to game 7 by the pacers. And none of those teams were good as the bucks.
Shaq is better than Dwight Howard
"Ah yes, the man of faith and values who has [5 children with 5 different women](https://www.sportscasting.com/you-wont-believe-how-many-kids-dwight-howard-has-fathered/) lol  [""HIPAA Law""](https://twitter.com/brohrbach/status/1442927151330697217)  Yeah, Dwight's on the All-NBA Stupid team for sure."
"I dunno man, Dwight Howard sounds pretty dumb."
"In terms of post play, Dwight Howard is not even in the same stratosphere as Pau Gasol."
russell #2 and dwight howard made it on the list.  which dogshit website did you copy and paste this from? LOL
Dwight Howard and Kobe Bryant. Although it could be argued that Dwight wasn‚Äôt like that anymore with the back injury.
Holy shit this sub. Dwight Howard can give 75% of the production of Deandre Ayton? What world am I in.
"Yeah i'm the one looking foolish here while you have DWIGHT HOWARD on a list of ""Best Post Players in NBA History"". Sure. LMAO"
Dwight Howard is overrated as a offensive player smh
Easy.   1. Kareem   2. Bill Russell   3. Wilt   4. Shaq   5. Tim Duncan   6. Hakeem   7. David Robinson   8. Moses Malone   9. Patrick Ewing   10. Bob McAdoo   11. Karl Malone   12. KG   13. Dwight Howard   And I am not even counting guys like Dirk and Chuck who played in the post and were way better as well. (This list is not a ranking in order of greatness fyi).
"Ayton is the perfect example of a guy who should get the max and someone will give it to him but I wouldn‚Äôt want it to be my team.   Dwight Howard gives you like 75% of the production for a minimum contract. I hate that the league is this was for big men but outside of KAT, Embiid, Jokic and Gobert and his 8 11 standing reach. The rest of the centers are pretty fungible."
Traditional centers who can't stretch the floor don't tend to receive Max contracts. Last ones to get paid were Amar'e and Dwight Howard.
The Dwight Howard special. Spike the ball into the stands when you're in position to actually get a turnover
Now if only they stop calling all these pussy ass calls on Dwight Howard. None of those would have been fouls in the 90s or even early 00s
"Because the Sixers played Simmons at centre, or with fucking Dwight Howard when Embiid did not play üòÇ"
"What time zone are you in? I'm in EST  Roughly how often do you browse r/nba? At a bare minimum 5-10 times a day. Since i work remotely as a product manager, probably around 15-20 times a day.  How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team?  I would say heavily in the past 3-4 years. I think I‚Äôd be a good addition to the mod team because I have a great grasp of the culture of the community- from the timing of jokes to the trends in how the community is feeling, i think r/nba is one of the rarest subs out there that has such a great community sense, and is oftentimes more informative than National media like ESPN or FOX.  Moreover, the reason my karma is 7.0K is actually mainly just from one post I made in the r/sports sub about Dwight Howard not believing in protection üòÇ (check it out), so I‚Äôd like to think i have a solid grasp on what can go viral/gain traction and understand trends of what makes a good comment in the community.  Is there anything you'd like to change about the subreddit?  I think having better setup with sponsorships or AMAs. I remember the Anthony davis thread was sudden and seemed ill prepared, which felt like such a missed opportunity when i saw it. I‚Äôd love to work with reps to help spearhead the whole engagement/partnerships side of the thread and engage with people who love the thread as much as i do (ie Simu Liu, who apparently reads r/nba everyday)  What is your favorite NBA memory?

I remember being allowed to stay up past my bedtime and seeing Kobe and the Lakers lose, and Kevin Garnett tearing his Jersey and just screaming, and then actually going to the duck boats parade in person to see rondo just snag a ball and sign it so effortlessly.

"It doesn't matter how many he has, like i said the award is terrible  Kareem has more than 2x the defensive team Dwight Howard has, a dominant defensive force who won 3 DPOYs to Kareem's 0  It doesn't matter again, but go on saying that ""double"""
"Dwight's problem was mentally he wasn't ready to accept his role, not the skillset to play that role, he says so himself and everyone knows that  Dwight was an amazing rim runner, shot blocker, rebounder and could play that role, just needed to stop posting up and think that he's 2010 Dwight Howard  Drummond has the same problem he thinks he's a star but also the skill problem of not being able to do that kind of game, Drummond has never been a rim runner, a good finisher, screen setter or any of those things"
Who cares about history. Book is better than Kyrie right now. He's basically a top 10 player.  Do you also put Dwight Howard over Zach Lavine because of career accomplishments?
[Dwight Howard breathes heavily in the same city as a ref‚Ä¶](https://imgur.com/a/gYQ6ZyF)
"Bill Russell was 6""9 and 5/8"" without shoes, taller than Dwight howard"
Correction: Dwight Howard gets a tech for being...............Dwight Howard
"Because Embiids backups have been guys like Richaun Holmes, Amir Johnson, Boban, Greg Monroe, and Dwight Howard. When he did play with the type of center he thinks he‚Äôd fit with, Al Horford, he had better net ratings than he did with Embiid that year."
"This is obviously true. As ridiculous as it is for Ben to make it seem like Joel is what‚Äôs holding him back, it‚Äôs just objectively true that he‚Äôd fit better with a center like Horford.   The fact that he also struggles with guys like Richaun Holmes, Amir Johnson, Boban, Greg Monroe, and Dwight Howard doesn‚Äôt do anything to refute that."
"Probably because, at least this season, the backup big for Embiid was Dwight Howard. Dwight and Ben Simmons together on the floor is terrible offence as neither player, can stretch the floor or shoot. So playing both of them together makes the offense bad, which in turn allows the defense to get a lot more transition opportunities. So really it‚Äôs because the offence is so terrible that the defense suffers"
"It's a phenomenon I feel like I see quite a bit - Player A gets rated too highly, then a few people realize this and start rating him lower than the rest of the crowd and calling him overrated.  Then more people realize it, then more, until so many people have lowered their rating of that player that the ""crowd"" rating itself has dropped significantly - but people still call him overrated even though at this point you could argue he's underrated now.  I think Kuzma fits that pattern. Dwight Howard was a like that for a little while a few years back. I think DeRozen was another good example. Maybe Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio. Examples from outside of basketball: Tony Romo, Coldplay, Leonardo Di Caprio who arguably had the same effect in the opposite direction too and went from overrated to underrated back to overrated, Erwin Rommel, Thomas Edison."
Exactly embiid and Ben hold each other back but play well together because they are both good players. The fit is bad but they make up for it. The issue is Dwight Howard and Ben don't fit. That's the difference. Ben has not had a stretch 5 since his rookie season outside of when horford was starting or coming off the bench.
"It likely says something about how *not* to construct a roster or a bench lineup around Simmons.  I.e. if you don't have an Embiid, you can't pair Simmons with just a regular C who can't stretch the floor, such as Dwight Howard.  We already knew that because it seems common sense, but the stats certainly back it up."
"He's a weird dude. He's got big ""early Dwight Howard"" energy. But, he won on GS."
"The Magic ""exposed"" the Cavs by surrounding Dwight Howard with guys that could shoot 3s. True shooting would favor a team that relied on a guy the  Delonte West put up 14/3/4 on 52% true shooting but you put Alston 12/2/4 on 49% true shooting over him for the series? Sounds like bias to me bro. Varejao put up 8/5 per game on 58% true shooting while Lee put up 7/2/2 on 51% but Lee played better?   You're clearly bull shitting some of this because Redick played one game and scored 7 points over the entire series. Gortat put up 15 points and 21 rebounds over 65 minutes stretched across 6 games. Boobie fucking Gibson ranks above them in terms of impact on this series."
"Your LeBron stanning is so obvious it's cringe.  The additions of Mo Williams, who was an All-Star in 2009, and Anderson Varejao, helped push the Cavs to a very high win total, when in 2008, the Cavs were only a Mediocre 45 wins in the regular season.  Not to mention that these rosters were specifically structured around LBJ with floor spacers to give LBj as much space to operate as possible.   66 win team beats playoff teams in the first 2 rounds and... it was impressive that LBJ carried the Cavs?   And then we just like to somehow pretend that the Orlando Magic with Dwight Howard and company were some mega team that was by and far away more talented than the Cavaliers lol. Yeah the Magic had more good players, they had Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis, but that team isn't some worldbeater."
LeBron obviously is incredible but you're overhyping a run that got ended by Dwight Howard and roleplayers vs LeBron and roleplayers lol.
"LeMickey gets saved by Dwight ""the Hard"" Howard for the third time."
You mean losing to prime...  *reads notes*  Dwight Howard and role players isn't enough to get acknowledged as one of the best runs all time?
"Yeah and New Orleans has had 3 of them (Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, and now Zion). It‚Äôs by far the easiest. Minnesota (Karl Anthony Towns and Kevin Garnett), Orlando (Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Dwight Howard), etc all agree.  Getting that player is easy. Putting a championship roster around them is hard."
Lebrons 5th ring joining duncan and Kobe (&amp; fisher) is from a tittle clinching buzzer beater walk off 3 from Dwight Howard.
Depends how his post game develops. He‚Äôs still going to have freakish strength and length no matter how old he is. If he gets a consistent fade nobody could block or contest him with his height and wingspan. Even if that doesn‚Äôt develop I don‚Äôt see why he can‚Äôt play a current Dwight Howard role in the later years of his career.
"Giannis, Capela, Jarrett Allen, and Dwight Howard"
The underrated plot line is how much Steve Nash hates Dwight Howard
"The block-chasing corpse of Dwight Howard is still a much better defender than those two.   It isn‚Äôt just block-chasing that makes Drummond bad. He is just clueless. He doesn‚Äôt know the plays and generally has little defensive (or offensive) instinct. He doesn‚Äôt really get out of position to chase blocks because he‚Äôs already out of position anyway, for everything."
"Harden put in his time and the rockets have already tried everything from Dwight Howard to CP3 to Westbrook. There was nothing left to try and houston was drained of resources trying to build around Harden. Looking back, I think Harden did nothing wrong asking for a trade, and I‚Äôm surprised Houston pushed back considering it was also in their best interest to trade Harden too. They failed to win and the window was closed, it was rebuild time but the rockets wanted to drag it on for first round exits, maybe a second round series if they were lucky. You can‚Äôt blame Harden for not wanting to waste away the last of his prime.   Simmons really is a different story lol. Sixers aren‚Äôt spent yet, Embiid is an MVP candidate teammate. Yet I also kinda feel for Simmons because his coach threw him under the bus. Rivers needs to go as well imo."
"In terms of physical ability: Dwight Howard, Demarcus Cousins, Drummond, Lebron, Pat Beverley   In terms of mental cunningness/toughness: Rondo, Kevin Durant, Lebron,   Being annoying enough to mess with the opponents: Trae Young, Chris Paul, Rondo, Harden, Schroeder,   Also if Gilbert Arenas is available, I'm bringing him just for the chaos.   Overall: Probably Lebron or Jimmy Butler"
"Let me introduce you to Dwight Howard  Baze averaged 4.3 fouls per 36, Dwight averaged 6"
"Bro, Caron Butler literally only drank soft drinks into his late 20s like litres a day. Lmao. Dwight Howard was rotting his insides by eating lb‚Äôs of candy a day."
"&gt; You can also play him physically and wear him down that way (a la Dwight Howard and AD in 2020).   If you meant ""foul the shit out of him and not be called for it"" then you are right I guess."
"He hasn't had it yet, but said he has to get it soon. I don't know the specifics of it, to quote Dwight Howard, M.D., that's HIPAA"
Hmm. I‚Äôm taking Embiid because the gap between their defense is significantly higher compared to the gap they have in their offense but this comparison is close. Jokic‚Äôs playmaking is transcendent. His assist numbers and playmaking comes while he isn‚Äôt ball dominant.   Embiid on the other hand has a deeper bag on offense but doesn‚Äôt have the range and shooting touch that Jokic has. His playmaking is alright but it isn‚Äôt comparable to Jokic‚Äôs.   Jokic‚Äôs defense is average at best because he is easily abusable in the pick and roll. You can also play him physically and wear him down that way (a la Dwight Howard and AD in 2020). Embiid on the other hand is versatile when switching to the perimeter but is losing some of his lateral due to his injuries. Still a good rim protector and post defender tho.
To be fair old Dwight Howard looks fun as fuck to play with.
"Whole lot of talk about what Ben deserves, much less talk about why he won't attack the rim consistently.  Everybody points to the 40 point jazz game and the fact that Embiid wasnt playing. Excuse me, i didnt realize what Simmons really needs is a stretch 5 like Dwight Howard.  The point of all of this is Simmons can only play to his potential is he's constantly being sucked off and told he's the special number one boy.   Does he really think that will happen anywhere else? He's not fucking good enough for that"
"Eh, I remember thinking he was overrated as fuck toward the end of his time on the knicks and knew him to OKC was gonna be a disaster, but he‚Äôs one of those guys who actually has managed to adjust to being a role player now. Dwight Howard is another guy who has done that the past couple years."
"It‚Äôs also on a team level too. Simmons has never been seen out in Philly with fans or his teammates. Embiid, Harris, Maddy, Thybulle have. Hell even in one year, Dwight Howard become a huge fan favorite and was out and about and enjoying his time with his teammates. It was clear that somehow even historical locker room cancer Dwight Howard was more liked by the team then Ben Simmons.   This is literally the summation of a player that has the mental inability to take ownership for his own faults and shortcomings. Somehow every single thing is everyone else‚Äôs problem not his."
"You people watch zero Sixers.  Horford was brought in so Simmons could have a stretch 5 on the court.  Without Horford, Simmons looks like shit playing with other backup centers, like we saw this year with Dwight Howard"
"if you don't have a ring it will always haunt you.  Statistically..what maybe 20% of players get rings? When you account for the number of years played, the likelihood of getting onto a contender as a role or back-up player. it really is the whole point of being in the NBA. It is the BIGGEST achievement by far, it gets the most respect. As soon as someone sees (NBA Champion) on that resume they say ""oh this guy has to be somewhat decent"".  Like if someone says ""oh JJ Barea, he's a good player"" and a total stranger looks him up, what would indicate to them he's a good player, as soon as they see ""NBA Champion"" they feel it makes sense.  Now obviously some players having rings is borderline meaningless (Patrick McCaw) but for a veteran player, having a ring, even as a back-up role player, is the ultimate sign of ""making it"" in the league. It shows that you had to sacrifice SOMETHING beyond the basic NBA player to be in the league. Whether it was the time commitment to getting good enough to leading a team or it was the willingness to take on a role for the greater good the make sure the team had what it needed, almost all players on championship teams play an important role for that team to get there.   In fact, with that argument, I feel like rings become undervalued today because of it. A lot of people think ""oh that guy rode the bench to a ring"" but that guy still had to GIVE something to that team to get to that level. It's an underappreciated fact of the game. Dwight Howard and Jared Dudley were CRUCIAL for the Lakers and you wouldn't even guess it looking at the box scores. Or PJ Tucker is another great example for Milwaukee, I vividly remember multiple veteran level defensive plays PJ Tucker made which absolutely made a difference in extremely close games on their run. Siakam for the 2019 Raptors was CRUCIAL, he had to step up and play an important role as the secondary scorer for the team. No one expected Siakam to take that jump, the year before he put up 6 ppg in the playoffs, but when the time was right Siakam put in the hours on his craft to become more than the Raptors ever expected of him.   Curry for the KD Warriors, he sacrificed so much in terms of basically agreeing to become the new second option and off ball scorer. Another complete player sacrifice made to get a ring.  So a lot of people don't appreciate what players on championship teams really have to do to win a ring. If Carmelo is able to win a ring with the Lakers in a smaller role this year, if WB is able to win a ring with the Lakers in a smaller role this year as the third option, both of them get complete respect for their careers because this would be one of the few cases where they've sacrificed their stardom for the greater good. It shows a ton of emotional maturity and growth. It would be great for Melo especially because of how much of a drama queen ""MY team"" type of player he used to be.  Also if Barkley sacrificed SOMETHING earlier in his career he'd probably have a ring. After losing in the finals Barkley has it on record saying ""at that point I knew there was a player I couldn't beat""  So then don't rely on YOUR skill, Barkley  could've sacrificed earlier to team up in Houston. Clyde was able to do it. Barkley could have too. Instead he forces it waaaay too late and loses out."
"If the world could only criticize and discuss people who were worse at a job than we are, we'd be a very quiet world.  Ironically enough, Stephen A's entire job is to criticize and discuss people who are doing something better than he could ever do it; the fact that Dwight Howard can play basketball better than SAS doesn't prohibit SAS from talking about him, anymore than SAS being a better TV personality than most of us prevents us from talking about him."
"It's a pretty good list, some quibbles here and there. Only major issue is Dwight Howard seems way too low. 5 time all-nba first team. Only Lebron, Kobe, Duncan, Durant, and Harden have more than that on this list. I feel like Dwight is getting punished for playing past his prime."
Most insane guy I've seen in-person up close was prime Dwight Howard on the Magic. That guy was a specimen.
Dwight Howard trade all over again.
That was one year of the Morey era tho and only because we had Russ   We were running Dwight Howard and Clint Capela for most of his tenure
"List is pretty solid, but Dwight Howard should be in the 10-15 range instead."
"‚ÄúThe Morey-era Rockets‚Äù didn‚Äôt have a 6‚Äô5‚Äù starting center for most of the era. That was literally just one season.   The Morey-era Rockets started with Yao Ming, the second tallest player of all time, at center. And during the Morey-Harden era the centers were Omer Asik, Dwight Howard, and Clint Capela until the final season."
2021 Dwight Howard is getting crushed by 92 D Rob and Malone
"I mean Howard was just sitting on the bench before, it doesn't seem like he was particularly heated until after AD put hands on him and by then there were 10 hands trying to pull them apart.  Don't forget AD is the guy who has had the ghost of a real Center starting next to him for half his career because hes too soft to bang down low with actual bigs. Dwight would catch a criminal charge for the amount of damage AD would suffer physically/mentally/emotionally if they ever came to blows."
"&gt; I get why Klay believes he deserves to be on the list, when a someone like Reggie Miller is there.  Counterpoint, Klay shouldn't complain about getting snubbed when Dwight Howard is not on the list.  He may be close to Miller, but he is not close to Dwight."
"Dwight loves them young...just saying. Your reaction is defensive as fuck, considering how cool you once were with the name calling &amp; shit..üòÇüòÇüòÇ I was just playin, but I could be on to something seeing as you're like the ONLY crew talking about Dwight Howard being snubbed. He wouldn't even advocate himself.  The Dwight Touched Me crowd over here.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Well Anthony Davis didn‚Äôt really hit Dwight Howard so it was slug-ish.
Tell ad everyone on the other team is Dwight Howard idk
I want to see what the Lakers are doing to Dwight Howard in the locker room.
"Kevin Garnett for sure. The guy was arguably the greatest PF that ever played the game regarding raw talent, a beast on both ends just like Duncan, but with even more athletic ability, his MVP season was super impressive... but all that talent was wasted by a very pathetic organization. I think Dwight Howard could also be mentioned, even if he was able to carry Orlando to the finals once, the franchise never gave him a allstar duo to compete with the Celtics and Lakers. The Celtics were injured and Dwight took advantage, good for him, but here it comes the 2010 season and what is the answer from the Magic front office? A freaking 33 years old Vince Carter, lol that was so ridiculous, it felt like a bad joke. I love Vince as a entertainer, but at that stage of his career, he was not a allstar duo material, not at all"
"I'm personally confused why they didn't rethink the whole list, there's no world where Dave Bing, Lenny Wilkens or Robert Parish is more deserving than Dwight Howard. Pete Maravich is on that list and Pete Maravich won 5 playoff games EVER before becoming a 6th man for the Celtics and retiring (He won 5 with the Celtics that year, averaging 11 a game.)  It's like what's the point of the list if you can't vote people off?"
No Dwight Howard on the hated team? Sub was on fire with the gay rumor and DH hate in general.
Fuck Dwight Howard he better be glad he's so big or woulda had his ass kicked alot in life.
Dwight Howard. That guy needed veteran leadership and a firm hand to help him mature in the NBA. Give him a Kenny Atkinson and Chauncey Billups from the jump and he's a top 10 player ever.
"It‚Äôs obvious to me from his physique. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm contending. You cannot be that muscular and shredded while being a professional athlete in a cardio based sport. Even Derick Rose, someone who is regarded as one of the most athletic players ever has a soft body. Nothing about Rose screams PED‚Äôs to me except maybe his athletic ability. Physique wise Dwight Howard is obviously on steroids. Hairline gone, Boulder caps for deltoids, shredded physique, insanely muscular ‚Ä¶ compare his  muscle tone at his age to players just hitting their peak athletic capability. It‚Äôs obvious to the trained eye‚Ä¶ maybe less so for you."
"I know that Landry Shamet (as a draft pick) was part of the big trade that sent Andrew Bynum to Philly, Dwight Howard to the Lakers, and Andre Iguodala to the Nuggets"
"Are we looking at prime Dwight Howard?  They don't do weights because they play games nearly every day. Obviously doing resistance training to failure will mess up your game performance, you're recovering from the workout so you can't jump as high, you lose a half step of pace and your form is stiffer. What does that have to do with anything. Soccer players run 7 to 10 miles a game in a shorter time frame but lift weights during the in season.  If you just think that he looks like he's juicing from the video then fine bro we just disagree. Frankly I have no clue what you're on about."
"Dwight Howard. I can respect his greatness, but whenever I watch him he's always doing the most BS shit in the paint. a lot of acting and grabbing"
What's really going to piss you off is the fact Shawn Kemp was better than Dwight Howard in their primes (sips tea). üòÅ. You're straight clowning right now pretending Dwight Howard's prime was so great &amp; he had this huge impact in the NBA.
Surprisingly.. Dwight Howard in his prime.. a well known *non-offensive* player.. scored more than Bill and was a better defender than Bill Walton. Relax calling Walton one of the best centers ever. Dude‚Äôs peak was two years where he scored 19ppg.
"You didn't actually watch the games...so how the fuck would you know? I saw Rodman with the Bulls &amp; Isaiah and others (including Chuck Daly) called The Worm, the key as he was their best defender. The Pistons &amp; Bulls weren't even close to superteams as we have now. Just barely two stars with one key role player..which was Dennis Rodman.  Need to learn more before speaking. Dwight was never a key player ANYWHERE outside of Orlando. His coach HATED HIM. Begone with the bullshit. Who made this Loser Appreciation Day anyway? Of all the underrated players, you drag Dwight ""Smiley"" ""Literal Cradle Robber"" Howard??!!?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Lol not obvious from his physique? Have you seen Prime Dwight Howard? You‚Äôre only counting games they play? What about practice? What about shoot around? What about the fact that during the season you cannot weight lift or have to cut back substantially or you will lose your shooting form? That body is not normal no matter how you try to cut it.
Dwight Howard. Name his best secondary star in Orlando. Rashad Lewis? Hedo? Jameer? Our GM absolutely continued to draft poorly &amp; sign massive terrible contracts.  We wasted his prime years.  People like to say the 3 point shooting carried us to the finals but that was built around the behemoth of Dwight being a 1 man wrecking crew defensively and offensively in the post(dunking). We failed that man.  Then his back failed him in LA after all the carrying he had to do in Orlando (also refs call some fouls instead of just letting big ass dudes just brutalize generationally talented big men down low ffs).
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I wouldn‚Äôt step to Dwight Howard even if I were AD.
"Holy shit, you look just like Dwight Howard!  It is achievable natty!"
"Right... tell me how that Dwight Howard news went a couple years back? Non-stop anal and gay jokes? This sub picks and chooses what it's progressive on, a lot."
"Nate Archibald, Dave Cowens, Billy Cunningham, Dave DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe, Robert Parish, Bill Sharman, Wes Unseld, Lenny Wilkens.  Do you think they all deserve a spot over Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard or Klay Thompson?"
Ayton to the Lakers for Dwight Howard incoming
"Dwight Howard, Alonzo Mourning, Nikola Jokic, Tracy Mcgrady, Alex English"
Dwight Howard is such a bitch lol
"&gt;Dwight Howard and AD got into a physical altercation on the bench‚Ä¶in my 42 years of being associated with the Lakers organization, I‚Äôve never seen something like that smh  I love how everybody says to stop overblowing it because ""it happens all the time"". And here you have the great Magic Johnson literally saying he's never seen it happen before."
"I have a feeling when they do the 100th anniversary team voters will choose the original 75, add Dwight Howard, and then pick 24 more."
Dwight Howard is a fucking clown.  Dude has zero actual basketball skills and just runs around acting hard and fouling people.  The bigger issue is the lakers are a poorly run organization that make terrible personal decisions.
Dwight Howard would beat the dog shit out of AD.   AD gots nothing on Dwight
"AD is a freak of nature, but Dwight Howard is another level"
"Whenever I see Dwight Howard, I always remember Kobe saying ""Soft, smh, Soft""."
"Yes, and he did the stare into the camera ‚ÄúLOOK AT ME DWIGHT HOWARD.. YOU DO NOT WANT..‚Äù narcissistic ass thing he does"
I see it all over the place the lakers got dwight howard melo and rondo star studded line up. Like bro dont put those guys in the same breath as westbrook ad and lebron at this point in their careers. I cant count how many times ive seen a post from espn or social media trying to force the storyline. Like bro everyone thats been watching the nba knows they r role players at this point they r solid role players i do think that. Thats alot better than they had last year without a doubt. I felt like i was literally watching lebron playing with a ymca pick up team in the playoffs last year. He didnt look that great either but good lord i dont think ive ever seen the other cast play and shoot like that. At this point they are all collecting dust to some degree. I hate the fact in my gut i know they are not going to he playing 100 percent every game...that feel out stage chemistry stage thing. They literally r going to play half the year trying to figure it out for the playoffs. Only preparing for the playoffs not any particular game in the regular season. The effort was horrible last night.
Fuck Dwight Howard
It‚Äôs a travesty that he and Dame made it over Dwight. There‚Äôs really no argument for that except that people don‚Äôt like Dwight Howard.
"There are many different players in history who could carry on offense by themselves. There are VERY FEW who could do it on defense, and one of those is Dwight Howard. It truly is a damn shame."

No fucking way. You're nuts. What Kobe said stands forever. Dwight Howard is SOFT
The biggest snubs were Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol.
Why is Dwight Howard still in the NBA?
Bynum was good too. But yes I remember the magic beating the cavs to go to the finals. I still think about how good Howard was that series.  I'll never forget how mad LeBron was when Dwight came up from behind him and blocked a half court buzzer beater. That shit us burned in my memory forever.
Dwight Howard is still playing?
Anthony Davis had never been close to as talented as prime Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard is just less charming Dennis Rodman.
""" Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard get into a tickle fight on the sidelines, Howard seizes"""
Or a nearly top 75 Dwight Howard
"Vince? Why? He made one All-NBA 3rd team and one 2nd team, that's it.  AD is better than T-Mac as well, twice as many 1st teams, plus 4 defensive teams to McGrady's none. T-Mac and Vince are overrated here.  Dwight Howard is IMO by far the most glaring omission. It's ridiculous that he didn't make the team."
"The best center ever since fat/mountain Shaq. I know this not sound that big of a deal because the position really lost it's impact, but we had some sparks like Dwight Howard (one of the biggest snubs of that top 75 bullshit imo), Yao, Big Ben, Stoudemire, Cousins, Embiid, etc.. and imo Jokic is by far superior than all these players, the guy is a complete skilled monster on offense and he can hold his ground on defense. That defensive impact of Dwight and Ben? Jokic can provide that at the offensive end"
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this after 2013 but I‚Äôm a big fan of Dwight Howard now. Even more so than AD at the moment.
"There is a saying in Poker: after an hour of playing poker, if you can‚Äôt find the weakest player at the table, YOU are the weakest player at the table.   Someone tell me why every team Dwight Howard plays on filled with drama? Any guesses?"
"Whatever, him in the bubble last year showed character:  &amp;#x200B;  [https://nypost.com/2020/07/20/dwight-howard-daring-nba-as-he-flaunts-no-mask-resistance/](https://nypost.com/2020/07/20/dwight-howard-daring-nba-as-he-flaunts-no-mask-resistance/)     [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/dwight-howard-doesnt-think-nba-players-need-to-wear-a-mask-inside-the-bubble/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/dwight-howard-doesnt-think-nba-players-need-to-wear-a-mask-inside-the-bubble/)  He can bounce, the Lakers need to trade him ASAP"
"So this is why AD got bigger than his 1st few seasons in the league so he cud body up the biggest guys in the league, just didn‚Äôt think it would b his own ‚Äúteammate‚Äù if that‚Äôs what u want to call Dwight Howard üôÑ"
Kendrick Perkins said AD can't be on the top 75 list if Dwight Howard isn't on it. He took it personally.
"did Dwight Howard make a ""pass"" at Anthony Davis ?"
I don't understand all the good words directed to Dwight Howard - there are not many players who squandered more ability.
"Adapt in what way though? It's like saying Capela and Gobert refuse to adapt. Dwight was always a rim-protecting, rebounding and rim running big. That is when he was most effective.   I remember one year even when he was goofing around, I think for the Charlotte Hornets, he had a 30 point and 30 rebound game against Embiid and the Sixers. This was a supposedly washed Howard.   Dwight gave into the pressure that he needed to be this post up half court big when he never had the touch, feel, coordination or fluidity to ever play that way.   Even Shaq was more fluid in the post. Dwight was a pick n roll big and possibly would have been the best in NBA history if he fully embraced that role.   Shaq and Chuck put a lot of pressure on him to work out of the post, he then started having sessions with Hakeem, but it was clear he didn't have that gift. Literally only Kobe, one of the most skilled guards ever, was able to really utilize Hakeem's tutelage properly. Amare Stoudemire didn't look too bad when he went to the post after working with Hakeem either."
Ben Simmons for Dwight Howard rumors start your engines!
what happened between DA and Davis? couldn't watch the game tonight but everything I'm seeing about Davis is obviously about the Dwight Howard stuff
*Dwight Howard kicks down your door*
Dwight Howard said: ‚ÄúYo mama so black!‚Äù Whatchu say bout my Momma?!?!? Then his pinched Dwights nipples..
"Always thought of AD as a more stretch power forward guy. Dwight was always a stay at home in the paint and good luck getting up to the rim sort of player.   You're right that AD is more versatile, but it's a slightly different skill set, imo. I know AD posts up a lot but that's like all Howard used to do besides dunks."
"If that 4th quarter wasn't enough evidence for the Lakers to move Anthony Davis to the 5 permanently and just let Westbrook play then idk what to tell you. Give the backup minutes at center to Dwight, DJ shouldn't play unless one of Davis/Howard is injured. Maybe even start the rookie. Lebron can have the ball in his hands the last five minutes of the game."
"Eh. If someone like Dwight Howard, who is an eight time all star, an eight time all nba player, a three time defensive player of the year, and was regarded as the second best player in the world at one point behind LeBron James, couldn‚Äôt crack the top 75, I have doubts that some immortal role player could do it. Blah"
Dwight ‚ÄúMario Chambers‚Äù Howard
Dwight Howard fucking dived
"Shaq always said Dwight Howard was a fake ""Superman"""
"The fact that I know who Dwight Howard is *because* of his skill and no other shenanigans (not that he hasn't gotten into some, Ijdk) makes him top 75. I can name like 20 players and he's one.  Most of the others are for reasons other than being good."
Dwight Howard committed a bad foul on CP3 on a nonscoring play that put the Suns at the free throw line.
Honestly AD reminds me more of Dwight Howard than Shaq.  At least Shaq got those 3 rings in a row.
Yoooo. That's the same face Vogel was making while AD was trying fight Dwight Howard.
"&gt;Dwight Howard and AD got into a physical altercation on the bench‚Ä¶in my 42 years of being associated with the Lakers organization, I‚Äôve never seen something like that smh  He has never seen a bench altercation before? Wtf lol"
Remove Dame and put Ben Wallace. Remove AD and put Dwight Howard.
"All I know is, as a laker fan, fuck Dwight Howard. I can‚Äôt believe we brought him back."
"If younger people don't know, Dwight Howard is a total POS.  Do some googling. He is trash."
Dwight Howard abandoned the bench it seems
That's insanity. This Dwight Howard shit is fucking with people's minds. He averaged 20ppg/13reb. Ever heard of LeBron or Giannis? KD? Prime Westbrook? Kevin Garnett? Embid? Jokic? Should I keep going?
In this day and age we should be caring about the mental health of these multi-millionaires. I do think its a reflection on you that you just can't sympathize with the personal struggles someone like Dwight Howard or Ben Simmons has to deal with.
He is but prime Dwight carried a bunch joes to the nba championship game. That man was the biggest on court force that maybe I‚Äôve ever seen (I only barely remember prime Shaq). Your eyes just followed Howard everywhere on the court
"AD is going into storm into Pelinka's office demanding Dwight is traded before he remembers that means he'll actually have to play center instead of just saying he will. Crazy to see AD getting upset at the guy whose main role is to take physical punishment in place of him  Also love Doris's explanation: ""...Anthony puts his hands on him and that seems to agitate Dwight Howard"""
Deandre ‚Äúnot worth a max‚Äù ayton with more points rebounds and assists than Anthony Davis/deandre Jordan/Dwight Howard combined
I stand in solidarity with Dwight Howard and all trans rights activists
Your room mate is Dwight Howard??
"Stephen A said Dwight Howard is lucky to be in the NBA? Are you meaning to tell me if I went roster by roster, I can‚Äôt find a spot for Dwight Howard?"
"Anthony Davis is billed as the leader of that team.  They say it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnthony Davis‚Äô‚Äù team.  But Anthony Davis is soft.  Good player, but not a leader.  When he tries to get on Dwight Howard for something, Howard takes exception to being called out by a seemingly weak man.  Strange to see this early on TV, though."
"No team in the league is cutting a player because of an argument like that. And Stephen A. Smith is bugging to say Dwight Howard is lucky to be on an NBA team. If he gets cut,  he'll get signed by another team. It'll be a trash contract, but there's definitely room for him in the league still."
so we‚Äôre all aware that Stephen A said DWIGHT HOWARD is lucky to be in the NBA right now? Is that not the craziest fucking statement ever made?
Only Dwight Howard can be that unlikable.
"Dwight Howard is just a super unlikable guy, at every stop he goes. It's a clear pattern."
"Stephen A. Smith needs to lay off the crack. Dwight Howard will just end up on a contender if the Lakers release him. Would probably be a good thing, since he could have a chance to win a championship this year."
Dwight Howard 3 is one of the greatest victory cigars
Just started watching the game at halftime. How‚Äôs my favourite duo AD and Dwight Howard doing?
Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard just need to kiss and they‚Äôll feel better
From what I‚Äôve been told‚Ä¶Anthony Davis gave Dwight Howard a big old hug after the game.
"As we all expected, Dwight Howard the mature vet trying to diffuse the situation"
"""BUT YOU DIDN'T DESERVE THAT SHIT. I SHOULD'VE BEEN UP THERE. ME! DWIGHT HOWARD!"""
How's Dwight Howard looks so physically fit but still incapable of 10% of his former self? Wilder vibes.
Dwight Howard is now on the trading block.
Dwight Howard is such a bum. Retire already you weirdo.
"his size is not athleticism. he has no impressive vertical whatsoever compared to Ja and Lavine and Ant. yes its incredible the way he's built, but he doesn't have more raw athleticism than those guys. he would need a vertical and better quickness, handles, agility, shiftiness to surpass those guys. i mean he has the longest/biggest hands in the entire league and one of, if not the longest wingspans besides like Tacko Fall or Boban. if you put him through a gaunlet of agility drills those other guys would outclass him easily. take away his alien hands and wingspan (which are not athleticism) and he wouldn't be compared to those guys for pure athleticism. doesn't take away from how much of a freak he his. i mean Dwight Howard can jump like 8"" higher than him. its not like his handles or finesse around the rim truly compare to those other guys mentioned, its just that for his size those skills are remarkable."
"Also how about the 12-13 Lakers with Nash, Kobe, Artest, Pau, Dwight and Antawn Jamison? Or the 2013 Heatles with a star studded bench of Ray Allen, Mike Miller, Rashard Lewis, Juwan Howard, Greg Oden. Plus prime Wade."
Ya dummies made dame in the top 75 over Dwight Howard
"I wonder if this year‚Äôs lakers team is one of the best ‚Äúif everyone was in their primes‚Äù teams ever?  Prime Lebron, Melo, Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Rondo, DeAndre Jordan as a backup center  There are some fit issues but the talent of that team would be insane"
Ben Simmons never had the peak of OBJ. OBJ is Dwight Howard.

we talking about Dwight Howard?
Haslem's geriatric ass woke up the comparatively speaking young Dwight Howard.
Yeah and also to fuck with Dwight Howard.
"remember when /r/nba believed dwight howard was a bottom for a transgender person? but then it was revealed later on that this person had a history of faking stories for clout and did the same thing to several other celebrities? but still, this entire sub believed it because it was so hilarious."
"&amp;#x200B;  The Bulls were the 11th offense and the Magic the 14th offense.  Both teams won because of defense, one team had Jooks Noah, Taj Gibson, Luol Deng, Ronnie Brewer, Omer Asik and Keith Bogans playing mins. The other had Dwight Howard and...I guess Quentin Richardson was fine and so was Brandon Bass lol.  Dwight had has good as a net rating as Rose (8,4 vs 8,8) on a much worse teams ?"
i love dwight howard. can we just appreciate this man
Shrink Dwight Howard by 10%
"Why do you keep saying 30 years? It was unveiled in 1996 for the top 50, now it's the the top 75.  And Howard deserves to be in there over Westbrook and especially Lillard. And Klay has never been a top 10 player, even Draymond would be a better pick, AD has been an elite player several years, as have Dwight - I find it hard to justify Westbrook, and especially Lillard or Klay over them. Dwight and AD have been top 5 players in the league for multiple seasons, Lillard has only flirted with that, Westbrook has at most 1 year of being that and Klay was only ever knocking over the door of top 10."
I'm a Raisin Nut Brand guy myself but I've heard Dwight Howard is a Fruity Pebbles kind of brother.
"First, I disagree with the assessment the top 50 cannot be revised - I absolutely believe it can be modified. Someone like Earl Monroe being knocked off for someone like Dwight Howard is a no-brainer.   Second, past 25 - it's the 75th anniversary, so 1996. To mind comes - Dirk KG Duncan Kobe Nash CP3 LeBron Curry KD Giannis Jokic Harden AD. We're only halfway there and I am out of no-brainers.  Howard is absolutely top 25 among the past 25 years. He is above Carter, TMAC - he was one of the best players in the league for half a decade - 5 x First Team All-NBA, 3xDPOY. I don't think you understand how impressive and uncommon that is - far less than 75 players have that level of individual accolades. But if you're saying Howard isn't top 30 - by all means, name that top 30."
"Bev deserved more than 1 game for that.  He only got 1 game bc he's small and weak, as evidenced by Jokic getting the same punishment for something that is not nearly as bad.  If someone like Dwight Howard shoved CP3 as hard as he could like that he'd probably get 3-5."
"Lmao I love how much weight you place on this stupid list, it's actually the reverse. People WILL be talking about Dwight Howard and how great of a player he was a decade from now. Almost no one is gonna talk about the 75 list a decade from now.   I think the other dude is just trying to say that it's ""good"" in the sense that more people are talking about Dwight and how underrated his career is. He's arguably getting more appreciation from fans than if he was placed 75."
"Dwight Howard takes it that way, but he should rather look at who are the other absentees of this NBA 75 list.  Pau Gasol, Artis Gilmore, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Alex English, Klay Thompson, Dikembe Mutombo, Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, ...  In short, Dwight Howard is one of those players who could have been part of an extended list of 90 players, but I do not think his absence is a scandal, to tell the truth.  Personally, in front of him, I already had Pau Gasol, Klay Thompson, Tony Parker, or Manu Ginobili."
"Dave DeBusschere, Thurmond, lenny wilkens, Dave Bing, Sam Jones, Parish, Mchale, Dave Cowens, Havlicek. Along with pierce and Allen. And this is as a Celtics fan. Nothing against the guys I named but Dwight is better than them all. Parish and Michale is debatable but when I picture Dwight Howard taking one of their spots along side bird I lean towards Howard."
I love Dwight Howard
It's absurd that Lillard got in before Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard gets held to a standard or what he didn‚Äôt become instead of appreciated for what he was
Dwight Howard. The literal topic of this thread.   Context?   3 time DPOY.   Led his team to the finals as the best player.   5x rebounding leader  2x block leader   8 time All star  8 time All NBA (5x on 1st team)  5 time all defense (4x on 1st team)  Been top 5 in MVP voting 4 times  Won a championship as a contributing role player late in his career (this doesn't even matter in regards to being clearly better than Lillard)  Lillards accomplishments are significantly less.
There‚Äôs the elite rim protector. In contention for GOAT rim protector after Dwight Howard and Jason Collins.
"Yeah, Shaq was the classic example, but during his era thing were a lot more physical. Whereas during the Dwight Howard era the rest of the league was getting a lot less physical."
"damn thats dope.  honestly i have a hunch that shooting gets more complicated as your body develops and builds strength. when i was that small i didnt have that much power, so i could focus more on aiming. i assume thats why guards are so much better than centers, and why dwight howard tried shooting free throws from like 18 feet.  also im fully aware that shooting in front of a crowd during a game is a lot harder than shooting alone in a gym. i accept the fact that if i was playing in competitive games with a crowd, i wouldn't make quite as many."
"Good thing Dwight Howard was on everyones favorite historically well managed franchise, the Orlando Magic"
"I must say far too often the NBA does nothing to protect big guys. I think back to the Orlando Magic era Dwight Howard. Where he'd get fouled 10 to 20 times a game. And they weren't soft little ticky tacky fouls either, he'd get hit HARD. It's reached a point where we simply don't post guys up any more.  Don't get me wrong I'm all for the physicality in the game, but I think a foul has got the be a foul be it in the paint or beyond the arch. The NBA needs to do more to protect bigs."
"Lol Yep, come on. There's KG compilations of him backing down. This isn't an achievement for Randolph.  The only guy KG was ever ready to fight was Dwight Howard."
I'd like to say Dwight howard is the floor for how Giannis could turn out. Dwight's peak was when he was 22-26 and he's 35 right now. 5-6 years of declining play does this to you.
Delusional fan bases are the WORST.   Dwight Howard is the best center in the league right now.
"Thats a slippery slope cause who determines how much ""punishment"" there should be? If Dwight Howard gives you an elbow to the chest during a rebound...does it give free reign for someone like dellevadova to dive at his knees and take him out? Obviously it doesn't."
That last guy has Tim Duncan at 27??? And unless I'm missing it he doesn't even have Dwight Howard on his list and has fucking Robert Horry and Derek Fisher on it.
"Yep, this has been an issue with every dominant big man in history. I can‚Äôt find the link but I remember once after a game early in his career where Dwight had gotten a T for a hard foul he dished back, Stan Van Gundy talked about how the league refused to protect him and that Howard was coming back into the locker room with bruises all over his ribs and arms every game. While it doesn‚Äôt condone his behavior sometimes I‚Äôm not shocked Dwight became a heel later in his career."
Dwight Howard
"There's no one on the horizon getting close to Kareem's record for career personal fouls.  Kareem has the most personal fouls with 4657, Karl Malone is second with 4578. Dwight Howard is the first active player on the list at 20th with 3813. I think something about the way the game is evolving away from dominant big men and hard fouls is going to make this one hard to breach."
This would've been a superteam like 5 years ago (with NY Melo and Orlando Dwight Howard)
"Ignoring your flair, say about Jimmy what you want but don‚Äôt say he‚Äôs fake tough. He played pretty much every single minute in the 2020 finals, if that doesn‚Äôt define grit and grind I don‚Äôt know what does. Not to mention, during that bubble period he got into fights with TJ Warren, checked Chris Paul when Paul tried bullying his teammate Robinson, and got physical with Dwight Howard who I‚Äôd say is more ripped than Jokic. Jimmy chirps, sure, but there‚Äôs plenty of evidence that he backs up each word with action as well."
"He's not even Top 10 yet... but I'll humor your argument, even though your argument contains mostly shitty non-basketball related arguments. ""small college hero"", ""off the court class act"" lmao wtf does that have to do with the GOAT conversation?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Steph‚Äôs Accolade‚Äôs over 12 years:      3x champion 2nd all time 3-pointers 2x MVP (unanimous) 7x all star 7x all NBA All rookie first team 6-time all NBA 3-point field goal leader      Regular season career stats:      34.3 career mins per game 24.2 ppg 4.6 reb 5.9 ast 47.6 fg%  Some of the GOATS worth discussion (Lebron, MJ) both have 4 or more rings, in which they won Finals MVPs for all of them, have averaged 27 and 30 points in their careers, and are #3 and #5 in all time points respectively. Lebron and MJ both have 17 all star appearances, both were ROY, and both on all-defensive teams. In short, both players have more accolades and success with better career ppg, rpg, apg (not mj), spg, bpg, and fg%. What does steph have again...?  Right now he's ranked #71/#67 all time in points behind Bob McAdoo, is behind Ray Allen in 3 pointers, is tied with Giannis and Steve Nash with 2 mvps, is tied with the likes of Javale Mcgee, Patrick McCaw, and James Jones with 3 rings, has less all star appearances than Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, less all NBA appearances than Moses Malone, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Garnett, and less ROYs than Ben Simmons and Michael Carter Williams. In regards to defensive teams and finals mvps, he has the same as you and I do, 0.  Forget Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, and Duncan, curry is only discussed with and might be below Kareem, Big O, Jerry West, and even KD.  If you want to go off the fact that he is only 33, then I can literally point to Giannis only being 26 and Luka being 22 as better contenders for the GOAT case in the future.  Let's just say that if his game ages gracefully and he plays another 5 years with the best case scenario (another MVP, 2 Finals MVP+rings, 5x all star appearances, 30 ppg average), then he STILL doesn't beat any GOAT candidate. If you add 30 ppg for the rest of his 5 year career, he still only has 31000 points, which makes him 8th all time. If you add 5 more all star appearances he would still only would have 12. If you add another MVP he still only has 3, and if you add 2 more rings and finals mvps he would still only have 2 finals mvps and 5 rings, same as Kobe, who realistically also isn't even in the GOAT conversation.  Just to contextualize, Curry would have to have at least 2 more mvps, at least 2-3 more rings all with finals mvp, at least 5-6 defensive all nba first or second team selections, at least 6 more first team all nba selections, and at least 7 more all star selections to even have similar accolades to **compare** with GOAT tier players.   To have similar **career** stats, steph would have to literally average 43.7 points per game while playing every single game for the next 5 seasons, average 9.8 rebounds, and lord knows how many blocks/steals just to have a similar stat to the lowest of either GOAT player (27 ppg, 6.4 rpg).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: fuck no"
Can't wait to travel back in time and tell 2014 me that we did get Melo and he's leading our newly minted Big 3.  I'd also like to travel back to 2013 and tell younger me that we do see a Heat vs. Lakers Finals with LeBron and Dwight Howard.
"Yes. He had 16 techs in the shortened season. He tied for the lead with Dwight Howard. Congrats, I googled it to confirm"
"&gt; However guys like Marcus Morris, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard are gonna try to get a reaction like that out of him again come playoff time. You'd be stupid not to.  Yup, exactly this.  Getting a reaction like Morris got out of Jokic is exactly what Morris and those types of playes want.  What's more impactful, Morris missing 2 games for the Heat or Jokic missing 2 games for the Nuggets?"
"dont worry morris , dwight got you, jokic punk ass would not do that to dwight howard, we got you, once a laker always a laker, he just being a punk cause he got son'd by us in the playoffs."
"He has zero tolerance for people taking shots at him, which I respect. However guys like Marcus Morris, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard are gonna try to get a reaction like that out of him again come playoff time. You'd be stupid not to."
Who knew playing Dwight Howard would be good for a struggling defense?
"First off, you never asked for proof. Just watch him play and look at the bs he does, like i already said, its very similar to what dwight howard does. He may not get in fights every night, but other players know what type of players jokic is. Im not defending the morris twins, im only defending the one that plays for miami. And i guess a cheap shot to someones spine isnt dirty? People who retaliate can still be dirty."
"Dont act like jokic is a clean player. Hes like dwight howard always doing dirty shit. Eventually someone is gonna retaliate. Jokic took a cheap shot, like a bitch. Morris hit him head on. There are different levels to physial/dirty playing and jokic is just dirty"
"Just for fun, here are the players with more 20 free throw games in their career than Harden and how many games they have in their career  Wilt 88 (1045)  Shaq 36 (1207)  Moses Malone 33 (1455)  Dwight Howard 29 (1190)  Karl Malone 22 (1476)  Kobe 21 (1346)  Harden 20 (887)  West 20 (932)  So Harden should end his career with more than any non-big."
[Hornets legend Dwight Howard](https://imgur.com/OrUfyKB)
"KAT. If Kobe thinks Dwight Howard is soft, I can't even imagine what he'd think about KAT.   DLo.   Wiggins.   Edwards is a tricky one"
"Early Dwight Howard such a beast. Had some years where he flirted around 20 points, nearly 3 blocks a game, over 14 boards a game, with a steal a game, while shooting 60% for the field."
Wasn‚Äôt that Orlando team just Dwight Howard + 4 shooters? A bit different compared to the Trees.
"When I first started watching nba I was a Dwight Howard fan, so I was a magic fan. I was a Boston sports fan in every other sport, but I was a huge Orlando fan for Dwight. I told myself I‚Äôd be a fan of whatever team he went to as long as it wasn‚Äôt the lakers. Well, we know what happened there. So I became a Boston fan to round out my professional sports fandom.    If they trade Jaylen for Ben I‚Äôll just be a magic fan again."
Dwight Howard bout to be called soft again and end up leaving üò≠
"Present?? It depends. But Bogdanovic is obvious to me.  Past?? Pau Gasol Memphis years.   Boozer since they went out of Chicago  Dwight Howard  Calderon (not Toronto fans, they love him)  Shawn Marion  Strickland  Rudy Gay (guy averaged nearly 20/6/2 with decent percentages for 700 games)"
Wow to be in the same conversation as Carson Edwards and Dwight Howard is a great honor
"Dwight Howard. Awesome dude, but his antics will definitely lose some games lol"
CP3 wanted to come to Orlando to team with Dwight Howard

Dwight Howard was a super skinny 18 year old with braces when he came into the league.
"Very rare to see a legit 7ft player move that fluidly. Being that coordinated, smooth and quick is more rare than being super fast and explosive like a prime Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard. As athletic as they were, they still moved kinda stiff. Only Hakeem, KG, young Kareem, Bill Walton, Bosh moved that fluidly as legit PF/C prospects. I won't include Dirk and Durant as both were never bigmen in my book."
Does he? Last year his only minutes were to intentionally get Dwight Howard thrown out of a game lol
Ewing is not a debate at all. Dwight Howard is not at Ewing's table
That‚Äôs Anthony ‚ÄúTop 75 over Dwight Howard‚Äù Davis to you.
Is it too late to rescind AD‚Äôs Top 75 and give it to Dwight Howard?
Current he is 7th in the league behind:  Bol Bol  Tacko Fall  Carson Edwards  Dwight Howard  Thad Young  Ben Simmons
"Looking forward to a 2031 Lakers roster of Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bronny James, Jayson Tatum, and Dwight Howard going 31-51."
"As a Dwight Howard hater, he should've."
Dwight Howard would have to be the most infamous example right?
Leading scorers are Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony. Is this 2009 again?
"**Los Angeles Lakers: 27% FG, 20% 3PT, 71% FT**  No Laker is in double figures in points, top scorers: Carmelo Anthony (8), Dwight Howard (7), 3 players (4).  No team can win a game with those numbers. The only reason why it‚Äôs not yet a blowout is because Portland was bricking shots in the second quarter, scoring only 15 points.  Also, we need to BOX OUT!!!!!!!! Damnit, they teach kids about boxing out"
Lakers fans would you rather have a) Westbrook shoot a midrange? or b) Dwight Howard shoot a midrange?
A Dwight Howard mid-range tells me that the team is in disarray. No functioning team would have let Dwight take a mid-ranger. Ridiculous.
"He's in, one easy stat that illustrates this.. 5 All-NBA First Team selections. This is a number that is matched or equaled by only 25 other players in the history of the NBA.. they are all in the HOF or HOF bound. Top 5 player for half a decade.  I think the 75 player list just messed with people's heads in giving them too many options.. actually break down guys like Reggie Miller, Dennis Rodman, Lillard vs. Howard and it's pretty clear he has more credentials.  Then again, maybe everyone hates Dwight"
"I'd say it depends on the player. My initial reaction to your question was ""Duh... obviously."" But the more I think about it, I can only say ""Not necessarily."" For well-rounded players, that seems to be the case. But some players' entire prime is based on athleticism. I can think of no better example than Ben Wallace. He never really improved as a player in terms of skillset. He was just a beast on defense and on the boards. But once his athleticism skewed back towards (or below) the mean, so did his career. Dwight Howard is another good example of this."
Where's that clip of him getting a rebound over Dwight Howard lul
"Okay we'll trade you Dwight for KAT so Dwight ""Superman"" Howard can be your player-coach"
"Eastwood has a narrow head too which can make you look taller. Dwight Howard looks taller in pictures than he is in reality because of how tiny and narrow his head is. He's like 1 inch taller than Lebron James, even though Lebron looks way shorter than his real height because he has the head proportions of a dwarf of Mordor."
"I will never understand what supposedly makes them the ‚Äúfavorite.‚Äù Maybe that‚Äôs just the weight of Lebron‚Äôs star power? Look‚Ä¶ the lakers are *old as hell.* And ontop of that they can‚Äôt seem to stay healthy. Didn‚Äôt lebron just pull some muscle or something? And we all know AD aint gonna play the whole season. Oh but that‚Äôs ok because you can always rely upon spry fountains of youth like Rajon Rando? Or wait, no‚Ä¶ Dwight Howard no wait‚Ä¶ Deandre Jordan no wait‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm not expecting much from LA this year. They‚Äôre good for a 2nd round out imo."
"Pelinka definitely also did a bad job building this roster.    It is very short sighted.  Good luck developing any talent for the future when the roster is loaded with deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony and Russ Westbrook.  They also no longer have any pieces for trades or to deal.   They are built to win now but I think they will struggle with winning anything meaningful. I absolutely would not be surprised with a first round playoff exit.  But the bad part of all that is if that happens, Lebron will not be accountable because he is a pseudo gm...he has all the influence but no actual accountability when it comes to these bad decisions."
"&gt; Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard  Lmfao"
And yet seems to be a better option than Dwight Howard.
"We ran a lineup with Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard with like 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter."
Hes so much better than Dwight Howard and it isn't particularly close
"Anderson Varejao has two streaks of 22 missed threes.  He started his career 0-22, made 1 three in 2009-10, then went 0-22 the rest of his career.  I have no idea why he popped into my head first, but I bet there's someone out there who has done more because they only shot heaves or garbage time 3s and never made them  EDIT: Dwight Howard missed 28 straight from the end of 2006-07 to the end of his ORL tenure. He hit his first 3 in about 6 years on his first attempt with the Lakers."
You mean the same Dwight Howard that‚Äôs leading the Lakers in 3pt%? That Dwight Howard?
"Dwight Howard apparently with 28, most were probably heaves."
Still puzzled about that Dwight Howard exclusion
Did Dwight Howard cause it?
"They do a great job using and converting bad contracts. Turning CJ Miles into Dwight Howard, saved them money, then buying D12 out saved them even more. Waiving Avery Bradley before his contract was guaranteed saved them 11 mill. Picking at number 30 vs 31 gives them essentially the same guy for an extra 2 years on a rookie deal.  Trading Grayson when he was up for a bag illustrates this shrewdness.  Im not that concerned with their money management and decisions. They would have to whiff on several to undo the goodwill so far."
"It'd be really interesting to see who voted and how they voted. [Howard Beck made his ballot public and he left Dwight off](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/10/22/nba-75th-anniversary-team-official-ballot). I don't agree with him, but at least he was willing to explain his thought process."
Dwight Howard has 138.5 but didn't make it. Lol.
Dwight Howard wins this one.
Also this won't get many votes but honorable mention has to go to Dwight Howard leaving Orlando for the Lakers. That got toxic at the end.
"I personally prefer Dwight Howard over Damian Lillard. But I still don't understand Anthony Davis being in the top 75. Before Lebron, all he managed was an 8th seed. He can't carry teams the way Lillard and Howard do."
dwight howard is the archetypal super star without rings  dude is going to be forgotten in a few more years
"I'm not really sure what kind of confirmation you're expecting here, almost all sports reporting of this type comes via unnamed sources and snippets of candid moments. If you're going to question the validity of this based on the lack of anybody going on the record and saying ""you know what, screw my career, I'll tell you what a bad teammate Dwight was"" then you might as well question about 95% of NBA news.  Much of the Dwightmare in Orlando has been well documented. Dwight complained about Van Gundy, caused problems in the media and eventually got his coach fired. He threatened to request a trade out of Orlando, then he publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise and made several efforts to re-establish himself there via community events before changing his mind yet again and forcing the trade to the Lakers.  In LA he publicly complained about needing the ball in the post to be effective, blaming his problems on his mis-use, despite playing alongside Kobe and Steve Nash, two all-time greats who thrive in the pick and roll.  In Houston, despite playing well for the majority of his tenure, his complaining about the style of play he was used in once again caused management to lose patience with him. He was playing alongside James Harden as The Beard stepped up into one of the greatest players in the league, and still Howard couldn't stop complaining about not getting to post up enough. So Houston gave up on Howard and he declined $22m to become a FA and sign with Atlanta.  Atlanta seemed to like him, but that didn't stop them trading him for peanuts less than a year later.  In Charlotte there were numerous reports that despite his solid on court performances, Howard was a distraction off the court, and a bad influence on rookie Malik Monk. So they gave up on him after just one season.  I can't make up your mind for you, but the common threads in all of those stints were 1) decent to very good on-court performance when Dwight was healthy, 2) near constant reports of discontent from within the team, 3) Dwight leaving before the end of his contract term every single time.  Obviously he wasn't the only ingredient in any of those situations, NBA basketball is a complex affair with a lot of people and overlapping contexts. But the reports of his attitude issues and causing problems have been so numerous, so detailed and so continuous for so many years that I think you have to be pretty wilfully ignoring it to believe otherwise."
"It was really Brooklyn since by that point they were either in their final season playing in NJ or their first season in Brooklyn.   Plus the Nets had D.Will before his ankles went south so it‚Äôs not like he wanted to join the Nets all by himself and build something.   Unfortunately for Nets fans we had to deal with the Dwight-mare shortly after the Melo-drama before the Nets traded for D.Will after Melo went to the Knicks.    Another unfortunate thing was D.Will not leaving for Dallas as a Free Agent since the Nets had Goran Dragic lined up to take the PG spot when D.Will was on the fence on a 5yrs Max in Brooklyn vs a 4yr in Dallas.   One of the worst parts of missing out on Dwight Howard was Billy King in a panic move sending a 1st to Portland for Gerald Wallace who was already seeing a decline and was then overpaid just to stay. Nets did that with the hopes of re signing D.Will by showing they were all in on winning.    Nets would have most likely drafted Harrison Barnes since they needed SF depth because at the time it was like 4vs5 when they were on Offense from how poor the SF production was.   If the Nets didn‚Äôt trade for Wallace and draft Barnes do the Warriors draft the hometown kid Damian Lillard with the next pick? This was before Curry took that next step and was on that cheap contract he signed because of his sketchy ankles.   Warriors could have easily ran Lillard, Curry, and Klay at the 1-3 spot. May have impacted them signing Durant as a FA since I think they needed to let Barnes leave in order to open up enough cap space."
"Jokic Bros vs Morris twins?  Beef Stew vs LeBron?  Enes vs the world?  Nah, give me DWIGHT HOWARD VS THE INSTITUTION üò§"
"&gt; ‚ÄúMy intention when I first left Orlando was not to go to L.A., and the Magic knew that, but despite my wishes to go somewhere else, they sent me to L.A., which was one of the places at that time that I did not want to go. I felt like it would have made people feel as though I was trying to follow in somebody else‚Äôs footsteps,‚Äù Howard said, a reference to Hall of Fame center Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, to whom a young Howard drew comparisons.  This is actually crazy tbh. I thought he wanted LA. In reality, the media wanted LA and the Magic felt like they could get the most out of LA because of the media pushing the Dwight to LA narrative.  But it also makes sense now. This is why the Nets pulled the trigger on Deron Williams."

I normally don't buy when a lot of players make excuse for stuff after the fact (like KD on going to the Warriors, I've always hated how he's since rationalized that decision).   But I 100% believe Dwight here, he makes a really good point."
https://www.peachtreehoops.com/platform/amp/2017/8/18/16168950/nbpa-players-voice-awards-dwight-howard-atlanta-hawks-teammate-of-the-year
"First of all, Dwight Howard position is PF/C. Giannis position is PF/SF and he does rotation to a center position as well. Double check on basketball reference ;).   I gave Rodman as example, but also followed with Kareem, Olajuwon, Duncan and MJ which you ignored to fit your narrative, lol. All players that I mentioned where monsters in offense, and in defense, literally their whole carriers, which Lebron isnt.  He was voted first time on second place with 4 votes, comparing to Howard who had 150 something. That is far from same thing.   He wasnt snubbed both times, since Gasol had best + -, and best defensive rating individually and Memphis as team, where was main anchor on defense. Check your ""facts"" before commenting."
"But Kawhi is the same position as Lebron, and Giannis is same position as Howard. Your argument is not good enough.  The narrative that Lebron can guard all 5 position is the myth. He didnt guard Dwight, and he also didnt guard Tim Duncan in finals, so far as everybody say that he could guard all 5 position is false.  Dennis Rodman was 1 to 5 defender. He had enough lateral speed to keep up with any player on the court. And he wasnt just defending, he would clamp them and lock them down. No matter if you are Kevin Jonhson, Larry Bird, Barkley, Olajuwon or Clyde the glide.   In games against Boston with Pistons, Rodman would always guard all players on the court, depending who is from first team in that time on the bench.   Now I will use MJ as an example. Jordan couldnt guard all 5 positions, but he could guard 1 to 3. And same like Rodman, he would lock them down hard. He was best defender at his position within all his Bulls seasons. He was best offensive player, and arguably best defender in the league. Three more examples: Duncan, Olajuwon, Kareem.  And why I am saying all this? Because Lebron was never on their level defensively, but they all had his level of production in offense. Lebron only had 2013 and 2014 as defensive beast. Before was somewhat average, and after...well we all saw how Kuzma os pushing him to guard 3pt shooter, and playing defense with his legs."
"Despite being an incredibly productive player for most of his career he has managed to alienate himself from no fewer than 4 organisations - Orlando, LA, Houston and Charlotte.   He was traded from the Hornets despite averaging 17/13 on good efficiency, primarily because the locker room hated him and the team was worried he was setting a bad example for Malik Monk, the one young player who apparently had a good relationship with Howard. And that happened *after* he won teammate of the year in Atlanta.  The point is, you can be well-liked by *some* people, in *some* places and still be a bad teammate and a negative presence in the locker room.  I will give credit to Dwight, once he went back to LA for the second time he seemed to accept his role as a support player and he hasn't been seen as a distraction for the past 2 years or so, but for most of his career that reputation was entirely deserved."
He could guard 1 to 5? So why he didnt guard Dwight Howard against Orlando in east finals?
To those who need a modern comp:  I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen Sabonis‚Äô prime in the NBA. Sabonis is probably closer to Jokic than Marc Gasol.   Prime Mourning would be similar to Orlando version of Dwight Howard.   Sabonis would win
Dwight Howard after he got reamed out at that gay/trans orgy
I mean he dunked on Dwight Howard. I get what you mean though
Bleacher Report wrote a whole article on why he smiles https://bleacherreport.com/articles/606156-orlando-magic-the-5-real-reasons-dwight-howard-is-always-smiling
"Vucevic was by far the longest-tenured acquisition in the blockbuster Dwight Howard to LA trade:  He stayed with the Magic for almost a decade, while Dwight and Iguodala left LA and Denver after one season each, and Andrew Bynum fell off the face of the earth."
"It's a wonder our defense is as good as it is with 5 of our 9 man rotation being 35, 34, 34, 32, and 32 years old (Gay, Conley, Ingles, Bojan, Whiteside).   That's almost as geriatric as the Lakers' rotation. Of the 13 players who have gotten 200-ish minutes this season, their have a 33, 37, 31, 32, 37, 34, 36, 33, and 35 year old (Westbrook, Melo, Avery Bradley, Bazemore, LeBron, Ellington, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Rondo). In their expected 8 man lineup for playoffs, assuming they make it, I'd expect at least Westbrook (33), Melo (37), LeBron (37), Dwight (36), Ellington (34), and maybe Bradley (31) or Rondo (35).  We're not quite *that* old, but getting there."
Based on the last couple of games Dwight Howard is a sharp shooter from the 3 pt line and can add spacing.
&gt;sensual touching of the referee is a-ok  Dwight howard doing the Macarena as we speak.
Jason Collins and Dwight Howard
76 Ahead of Dwight Howard
There are people on this sub who say the same thing about Dwight Howard‚Ä¶
My vote goes to Dwight Howard. People just gloss over his prime
Idk the way you describe him makes him sound like Dwight Howard   Davis is the type of big to make tough jumpers. He has multiple game winning threes at the buzzer.
"Great game by LeBron James, and Dwight Howard. The only complain I have with LeBron is his decision to attempt the game winning three instead of driving and looking for a foul. Other than that, excellent performance."
&gt;[Dwight Howard proceeds to give a lesson on how giraffes walk that is far too long for publication]  Amazing
"Lakers shouldn't be losing with this line up. Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo. That used to be a team you bring to the Olympics."
"""I can never look at Dwight Howard the same way after THAT""  -Skip Bayless probably"
Sabonis should rush Dwight Howard
PG: Darius Garland  SG: Jordan  SF: Bird PF: Carmelo  C: Dwight Howard
"&gt;It‚Äôs funny you point this out in a discussion about a player who you‚Äôre defending who has a direct hand in those outcomes.  I point this out because Ben Simmons has been in the league only a few years and has clearly been chosen as the scapegoat for the 76ers' incompetence, which started way before he got there.  &gt;A player who hasn‚Äôt shown an inkling of improvement in a basic and fundamental basketball skill in 5 NBA seasons... year after year of NO, I repeat, NO progress in shooting, which culminated into what happened in Game 7.  Do Dwight Howard and Clint Capela also have work ethic problems for not becoming better free throw shooters? Jimmy Butler's 3 point shot has been broken for like 3 seasons, does he have work ethic problems? Prime Rondo was on a superteam and was a terrible shooter, did he have work ethic problems? Some people just aren't shooters dude. This sub's obsession with shooting is so strange.  He has improved his game in other ways, notably taking huge leaps defensively since entering the league. Ya'll (fans + Doc Rivers in particular) ran a 3x all star, 2x all-defense, and 1x all-NBA player out of town because he had 1 bad playoff run and now you have to deal with the consequences.  If the Heat threw Jimmy Butler under the bus for sucking against the bucks and blamed him for getting swept he (and any other star in the league) would have done the same thing Simmons did. So again, this is 99% on the Sixers. They burned the bridge."
Imagine Young Dwight Howard as Nick Frost from Attack the block
"""I wanna go broke"" - dwight howard"
is Dwight Howard a real life Brian Fellow?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTaPSGoI-XU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q89rKlSJNhs
Why cant he be Dwight Howard then?   Checkmate Kings
"He was definitely faster back then and that was also before teams really adjusted to the 3 point revolution. So I think he did better than most teams relatively. He was mobile for a big but he also didn‚Äôt do anything else a big could do besides o-boards. If you wanna be mobile, then why play Tristan when you could just play another forward? And if you wanna go big, why play Tristan when you can get a guy like Dwight Howard or Javale for nothing?  I also think part of his success back then was just lebrons IQ. Lebron was calling out plays before they even happened  Also offensive boards are kind of ignored nowadays in favor of transition defense"
"They did it with him but he wasn‚Äôt a starter or a key piece. Kuzma gave you 10 inefficient ppg and basically nothing else during their playoff run. Rondo was running the offense while LeBron sat and Caldwell-Pope, Caruso and Dwight Howard were playing strong defense. But the Lakers this year are trying to turn Tucker into a starter and a key piece and I do not see that working if they want to make a playoff run. They should trade him for an NBA vet who has more experience. And they should have done the same with Kuzma when he was being compared to Jayson Tatum early on. It would be crazy to make that same mistake again."
"You're basically combining three giants with only slight differences in their skill set.   If you were like, imagine combining the shooting of Curry, court vision of Stockton or Magic, the motor and defensive chops of Rodman, the cold bloodedness of MJ, the body of LeBron, with one of the three, and the hair of Dwight Howard, now we're talking."
I don't think Cuban's ego would allow that trade to happen it b/c that would vindicate recently fired GM Donnie Nelson who wanted to draft Giannis but was overruled by Cuban who instead had them trade down to make more cap space to try (and fail) to sign Dwight Howard.
"‚ÄúMalik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, THT and Dwight Howard combined for 28 points tonight against the Knicks. Evan Fournier scored 26 points tonight against the Lakers.‚Äù"
Every player should be allowed to box 1 3 minute round with a fan every season. Fans would learn their place after the first Dwight Howard fight
Oh I‚Äôm sorry your saying Drummond is a better defender then Howard LOL? Also Caruso guards wings just like kcp does. And your acting like they don‚Äôt have ADstill in the paint lmao. Please don‚Äôt talk about what I know about basketball when you don‚Äôt even know what teams players play for or confuse Dwight and Drummond.
I‚Äôm sorry have you watched basketball this year?  Dwight Howard is on the Lakers? And if Caruso is just a pg defender then what is KCP? Cause they literally guard the same players.
Not losing KCP and Dwight Howard? Cmon‚Ä¶PG defense is flashy but one of the least impactful overall
I think about it all the time man. Im not even a huge Chris Paul fan but I know they could stayed competitive for a while and instead settled for a broke down Steve Nash and injured Dwight Howard.
Have you heard the good word of our lord Dwight Howard?
I hope that Dwight Howard retires and goes to TNT so Shaq and everybody else have to make nice with him after almost 20 years of diminishing his legacy.
"As a first generation Asian-American who spends plenty of time in circles with native born Asians, plenty of them only know Jeremy Lin for his ethnicity.

With that flagrant-2 foul from James, four different Lakers have been ejected from games this season ‚Äî and none of the four are Dwight Howard.  That made chuckle lmao"
Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard...they both fit hete

"It you want to argue that Isaiah Stewart deserves to be punched for box out shenanigans, can I introduce you to Dwight Howard? Steven Adams? And every center ever? Jesus man, get your shit together."
"It was so weird watching people just gloss over the fact that Dwight had no jumper when arguing that he deserved a spot over AD on that stupid top75 list.   AD is the true unicorn, a guy who can anchor an interior defense, switch to all five positions, post up on smaller guys, and shoot a three when open. He is the complete package, as we all saw in the 2018 and 2020 playoffs, he has no holes in his game. Accolades and longevity aside, Howard doesn't hold a candle to what AD brings to the table."
"I consider serial floppers and injury fakers to be 'dirty' so he fits the bill, but he's not Dwight Howard throwing elbows or Bowen gunning for injuries for sure."
"On a related note, IIRC there's a moment in the 2011 dunk contest featuring Javale McGee and Blake Griffin where color commentator Dwight Howard says, out of approximately nowhere, ""light-skinned brothers making a comeback!"" and none of the other commentators know what to do it. So, sort of?"
"Dwight ""Rim Rattler"" Howard"
"Nikola Pekovic. Even Dwight Howard said he felt powerless against him. Sometimes guys would try to jump on him and he did not notice the extra weight. When he moved, he displaced guys from the space he was moving into.  Among the current guys probably Nurkic. There was time early on in his career that Carmelo offensively fouled him by jumping and elbowing his mouth. Nurkic spit out the teeth at the piece of shit ref who did not call the flagrant and just kept playing. The guy gets injured often but it is because of his wild exertions and he just does not know how to control his body well. His father is a legendary giant and Nurk was only recruited because a sports agent bet that a son from that giant could easily be successful at any sport which is why Nurkic was taken away from his family at 13 and placed to play against grown men which he easily adapted to."
"Dwight Howard not only made multiple threes, he made 2 in a quarter in the FIRST HALF!  In other words, not during garbage time!  Meanwhile Ben Simmons has made 5 career 3 pointers and never more than one in a game.  If someone told me this would be the case in 2017 I'd think they were making some outlandish hottake/prediction."
Dwight ‚ÄúStephen ‚ÄòSky Fucker‚Äô Curry‚Äù Howard
I hope this emboldens Dwight Howard to take more threes.  A lot more threes.
"Dwight Howard, known stretch five"
Don't let this game distract you to the fact that Dwight Howard made 2/2 from 3 on non-garbage time minutes.
I think he will get something lame like one game. Most players would get like ten games for this. Dwight Howard would be suspended forever

Dwight Howard is unironically a pretty good shooter.
Dwight Howard was 100% from three tonight.
"Those players all ended up sucking though. Dwight Howard (2.8 PPG) and Alex Caruso (6.3 PPG) were the only role players on the Lakers to score above league average TS%, and Caruso only did it by .002 over league average.  The supporting cast was so bad in the finals that they probably would have lost to the Heat had the Heat's three best players not gotten injured in the first half of game 1, and that would have been with LeBron and AD both having elite series. That's how bad the supporting cast was."
"I think they‚Äôre suffer on defense from probably 3 things and some of them can be fixed but some of them might require roster changes.  * Lack of rim protection all year. Dwight fouling more than blocking, Jordan obviously looked washed, and while AD is playing good individual defense as evidenced by his opponents fg% he has not been great as a help defender this year(some of this is them just switching instead staying with the previous man, as it drags AD away from the basket) and while I know he could still be building/recovering he doesn‚Äôt look as quick as he used to be. This could be solidified with minor scheme changes, team familiarity/chemistry, and potentially even by them playing better on defense (unlikely but we‚Äôll see if they can lock in at some point).  * Bad perimeter defense(and why). They‚Äôre atrocious at stopping anyone from driving at the moment which makes rim protection much harder and just weakens the defense a ton usually cause even disciplined teams will instinctively collapse. Problem being they both don‚Äôt have a ton of plus defenders to swap in and they need these guys to produce some offense as they simply don‚Äôt have the defense talent to really pigeonhole teams. Westbrook barring a trade is gonna be weak here especially cause he gambles, problem is so does Bron. You add in guys like Melo/Bazemore/Ellington and you instantly are just rolling out the red carpet to the paint on some nights. This is mental thing, they need to be more physical in cutting off drives to give their big men time to help. I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing what a Howard/AD/Lebron/(Monk or Melo)/WB lineup looks like. Which reminds me‚Ä¶.  * Inability to rebound at times. You might say, ‚Äúwtf  they‚Äôre like tied for 10th‚Äù and that kinda says something in its own right. No team with D12/AD/Lebron/WB, all of them good rebounders, be this middling in that facet of the game. They both seem to not attack it with energy time to time and they definitely don‚Äôt do little things like box out. Lakers have most contested rebounds secured per game which sounds nice till you realize they‚Äôre always consistent due to poor position and lack of box out. They‚Äôd solve some of their defense problems just by not giving up second chance buckets and being able to better control pace."
"And that's bad. Their team has  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russel Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony. Then they have great centers like  DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard.   Unless it is a known fact they're all washed up, that team is supposed to be scary, at least offensively."
Dwight Howard made a three...lol.
"That's why when you have the combination of strength, weight and elite vertical you get special players like Dwight Howard and Lebron"
"I low-key forgot Dwight Howard was still in the league, talk about a fall from grace."
"You‚Äôre comparing one of the greatest offensive players in NBA history, who also happens to be a top five clutch player all time, to Dwight Howard?"
Dwight Howard is the best personality in the nba
"Howard came to Houston after an injury and got injured in Houston too.  He was not his prime self and was making boneheaded plays.  If Dwight played like Capella they would‚Äôve popped off.  Instead, Dwight wanted postups which he wasn‚Äôt great at anymore."
dwight howard is a bitch
Lol fact that your even brought up Howard in all this shows how little you‚Äôve actually watched the Rockets. Oh sure let‚Äôs feed Dwight even more post touches even he was awful.
Dwight Howard is so goddamn dumb
"lol  &amp;#x200B;  i like you jokic but cmon bruh  &amp;#x200B;  if shaq dominated vlade, sabonis and other great centers in his era im sure he would be able to guard you just like dwight howard did last summer"
"I know this guy is talented but he is really weird as the way he dribbles the ball. Can't wait to see him turn out to another Dwight Howard. Dude, just make some damn hoops instead of sticking your nose to everything."
Dwight Howard...
‚ÄúHOT TUB TIME MACHINE... it‚Äôs time for Dwight Howard‚Äù  ...what?
Did Joe Harris just outrebound Dwight Howard
Bernard James (drafted in 2012) is older than Dwight Howard (drafted in 2004).
"Harden had a younger Dwight Howard who was just barely removed from his last DPOY season and lost to the Warriors with Curry injured.  And that was before Durant.  That's pretty dang disappointing, especially since it was a quick 4-1 elimination."
"Austin rivers, nic Batum, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan whiteside, Marc gasol, demarcus cousins,Harry Giles, and Jeff green are all valuable players on minimum contracts"
&gt; if trash talking is associated with the sport itself in any way  It's fine if it's limited to what happens associated with the sport.  But some of the hate PG gets is really weird.  I regularly see comments about his fiance being a stripper and his romantic history with Callie Curry being thrown at him.  I know players like Dwight Howard get clowned for having a lot of baby mamas so PG isn't the only one.  There's a select group of players who get a lot of hate for stuff off the court.
Dwight Howard
by that same note dwight howard and cp3 have also been known as notorious locker room cancers on the many teams they‚Äôve been on. so i fail to see how harden is the common thread here. and that still doesn‚Äôt explain how those rockets teams didn‚Äôt perform well in the playoffs
He is in a really good shape. He's never going to have body like Dwight Howard if that's what you mean.
Lol Jokic can‚Äôt guard Dwight Howard you arguing in favor of his defense is laughable. Stop pulling up defensive stats and look at games
"It was an interesting down season by Bryant but he wasn't a top 3 player in 2010-11 season.      The top 3 players in the time frame you're asking;   2009; James, Wade, Bryant   2010; James, Wade Bryant   2011; Wade, Nowitzki, James      Also, Dwight Howard and Chris Paul were closer to be being top 3 than Kevin Durant in that time frame. And Nowitzki was always in the mix."
The refs were awful with some of the calls on Dwight Howard and other calls that also went the Wizards way. Wasn‚Äôt as one sided as you‚Äôre trying to make it sound. Wizards finished the game with two more free throw attempts than the Sixers.
"Marcus ""Carmelo ""Dwight Howard"" Anthony"" Morris Sr."
"No man, there are plenty of times in the past where Chuck jokingly pokes fun at Shaq and Shaq gets visibly irritated and usually goes straight to the ""muh rings"" defense.   And just look at all the Dwight Howard shit. Shaq has a weird disdain for two types of big men: ones who threaten his legacy, and one's who play with more finesse.  A lot of time he's joking, but he legit has weird issues with putting players down to defend his legacy when he really doesn't need to."
"This is wrong. Other than 2008-2009, Durant was better from 2009 to 2011, so was Dwight Howard"
"it‚Äôs cuz they overrate every player to have a B-A on everything. Dwight Howard has a C- 3 point rating. the nba part of 2k is worthless, it isn‚Äôt even close to a basketball sim anymore, just an arcade game"
"Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Robin Lopez, Brook Lopez, Zubac, McGee, R Williams, Favours, etc."
"Well let's be real tho, if Skip and SAS delivered their takes in the same way, but without all the hot-takes, they sadly wouldn't be near as popular. I do agree their delivering is also essential to their success tho, and allows fans of the show to keep watching even when it's terrible takes.  Shaq is... Shaq. He occasionally gets me on the floor laughing, but I agree his voice is terrible. Personally I hate how often Shaq gets offended and how much of a baby he is about it. Dwight Howard (imo) would have had a *much* stronger career had Shaq embraced/ aided him when he claimed the Superman name. Apparently Shaq thinks that name is his alone (not even close, but okay), and was such an asshole about it. The whole time Dwight's just kinda like, your my hero and I want to be you. Made me despise Shaq, like most would be like ""cool you want the name, let me teach the way"" rather than ""He [Howard] has to do something first to be called Superman. Anyone can win a slam-dunk contest."" (actual quote).. like dude only went with superman cuz he idolize you. What a asshole way to respond to a young man trying to be the next you."
6'4 Kobe.  You ain't the only one. I also thought Drummond would be Dwight Howard at worst.
"I know. He thinks it‚Äôs funny because he respects chuck, but it still gets to him. He doesn‚Äôt respect gobert or Dwight Howard. If either of them said it he would be pissed"
"That's like saying LeBron had 3x DPOY Dwight Howard with him. The Nuggets had a solid supporting cast even without another superstar. If you want to get technical, Jrue never had an All Star selection with the Pels either, and the rest of the team was awful. They had Omer Asik on a 60 million dollar contract."
"this is super revisionist history. Derrick Rose led the Bulls to the best record in the NBA with 25/4/7. The only other candidates were Dwight Howard, who was only the 6th seed, and Lebron, who had less wins despite Wade scoring 25PPG and Bosh scoring 19 PPG."
"&gt;Prime Howard was a top 3 player.  Might be a bit over-the-top. Prime Dwight Howard, by most metrics, was 2010-2011. You still had prime LBJ, Durant, CP3, Pau Gasol, Wade, Rose. I think he gets extra props because he once went to the finals. But if that team were in the west, they never smell the finals."
I agree that he‚Äòs right. So does everyone. Which is what makes it awkward. Everyone knows shaq is far superior to gobert or Dwight Howard. So what‚Äôs the point in taking pot shots?
He's like homeless version of Dwight Howard
"*Dwight Howard:* ""It all starts with the D."""
Drummond isn‚Äôt Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard was also the best defender in the league and had athleticism Drummond can't even dream of.
"Disagree. Dwight Howard built a HOF resume in 8 years with ""no post game."""
"Yeah... I think people dismiss both Wilt and Russell because they were both so ridiculously dominant compared to their peers and assume that means their opponents must have been terrible.  But one was 6'10'' and the other 7'1'' and both were ridiculous track and field athletes in high school. Look at this quote about Bill Russell:  &gt; at the meet Russell tied Charlie Dumas, who would later in the year win gold in the Melbourne Olympics for the United States and become the first person to high-jump 7 feet  Bill Russell was built a lot like Giannis, but more athletic, and with Draymond Green's approach to the game.  And for Wilt there's just no comparison. The closest thing I can think of is if Dwight Howard was 3 inches taller and had a smooth fadeaway and soft touch around the rim.  Either one of them would be looked at as historic prospects if their high-school selves were alive today."
"Shaq learned a lot of it from guys like Wilt, it‚Äôs like a big man tradition.  The dominant bigs have a history of challenging other up and comers to see if they have that dog in them/worthy of carrying that mantle.  Wilt did it to Kareem, Bill Russel, and even shaq.  Guys like Moses Malone were hard asses too, Shaq carried on what he learned from others.  He used to fuck with Yao Ming a lot at first until Yao earned his respect, Dwight Howard, Andrew Bynum, and you see it now with Embiid and Gobert.  I feel like it‚Äôs not necessarily him being insecure but it‚Äôs him having the utmost pride in his career and legacy of not only him but thed dominant big men that came before him.  The game is different now and elite big men don‚Äôt have as much of an impact as they once did, and Shaq realizes that.  The old generation is always going to challenge the up and comers and hold them to a higher standard."
"Here's hoping, this team is fucking loaded its going to be so annoying if we don't get to see it for real.    Honestly I feel like DJ might actually a pretty decent fit for that second unit, too, if he's only playing fifteen minutes maybe he can bring that Dwight Howard energy."
"I mean, the Sixers have  3 max players but also have a very solid supporting cast. Seth Curry, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, all of those are players any fan would love to have on their team."
"Jokic, Giannis, Dwight Howard was not good as a rookie, a lot of people forget."
"Imagine traveling back to 2011 and telling everyone that LeBron James, Dwight Howard, and Rajon Rondo would one day be on the same team... and that team would be the *Lakers.*"
What picking up Dwight Howard and Danny Green will do for ya
"dwight howard is ü§£üò≥ personified  ""that's in... THAT'S INNN"""
Followed the Dwight Howard ring comment and realised the original tweeter's reply was pretty top-knotch hahahahha:   @DwightHoward lmaooooo got one unlike your babymothers  Source: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/08/dwight-howard-twitter-burn
Dwight had another good one on twitter in [2017](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/07/nba-dwight-howard-twitter-trolls-jokes-spurs)  &gt;Twitter troll: Dwight Howard has been passed around more than the collection basket at church  &gt;Dwight: what about ya moms. She gets passed around more than the ball does for the spurs.  &gt;Twitter troll: Dwight gets passed around more than a blunt  &gt;Dwight: u smoke a blunt yo lungs gonna explode. Bird chest lil boy.  As a bird chest lil boy myself I found it hilarious
Mikan  Wilt  Kareem  Shaq  Bynum  AD   Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Dwight Howard  Vlade Divacs  Javale Mc Gee    All of them except Bynum making the HoF
Dwight howard is useless.
The way Dwight Howard responded made it even better
"Fit matters though. I mean, Harden's Rockets are a great example of that with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and now John Wall (because Harden's leaving) all having fairly short stints playing alongside him.  Another great example is that Olympic team real early in LeBron's career where it seemed like he was the only one playing hard and they lost to Puerto Rico. They would have been better off only taking NBA players that wanted to be there instead of just the biggest stars they could get.  Fit matters way more than some people think."
"I‚Äôve started to change my tune on the whole ‚ÄúLakers lost all their rim protection‚Äù talking point. Obviously, I‚Äôd rather have Dwight than not, but so far this season the numbers are showing Gasol is not the downgrade in that area many seem to think. He‚Äôs definitely not flying around swatting shots into the stands, but so far he‚Äôs getting almost twice as many blocks per game as Dwight in not many more minutes:  Gasol: 1.1 blocks in 19 minutes  Howard: .6 blocks in 14 minutes  And the advanced stats paint a good picture for Gasol, too:  Gasol: BLK% = 5.0, DWS = 0.3, DBPM = 2.5  Howard: BLK% = 3.5, DWS = 0.2, DBPM = 0.2  Trez isn‚Äôt on the same level as those 2 (or JaVale) at all, but he‚Äôs not a total mess on D like some people seem to think. And I do agree, come playoffs Vogel should probably have his ideal defensive rotation figured out (like you said, Trez at 4, AD/Gasol at 5 on D; flip them on O)  Matthews has been a the *slightest* of steps down from Green on defense, but DG has been turning the ball over WAY more than Wes, as well as shooting worse (hope Wes stays hot).  And I‚Äôve been really impressed with Schr√∂der‚Äôs on-ball defense. While Bradley is the better defender overall, DS17 is a full court pest. And the gulf in their offensive outputs will likely only grow (Bradley will NOT shoot 52% from 3 all season).   TL,DR: the defense is looking like a lateral change (a *slight* downgrade at most) while the offense is looking VASTLY improved."
"Dwight is 35 years old and under contract for a single season. Unless you desperately want to have a serious title run and you think 35 year old Dwight Howard is the key to that run, keeping Dwight over Thybulle makes literally no sense."
"Rockets centers: Moses Malone, Ralph Samson, Hakeem, Yao, Dwight Howard, PJ Tucker"
"I‚Äôm sorry but this is a moronic take. The jump from College to the NBA is absolutely insane, never mind the jump from Whatever the hell you play at to college. Any NBA player would absolutely demolish you without trying.   For reference, I‚Äôve seen Dwight Howard play pick up. He was barely trying, going at maybe 25%. He wasn‚Äôt missing from three and looked like Curry dribbling. The only reason NBA players look bad in NBA games is the fact that they are going against the literal best of the best, every single one of their basketball skills is significantly higher than your best skill, because they are athletic freaks who are full time basketball players."
Dwight Howard (if he stays one more year) off the top of my head. He is 35 and is in his 17th season
"He's not Dwight Howard fit but he's definitely in better shape cardio-wise than I've seen him since Kansas. A bit more buff too. Hopefully Dwight shares the high end, undetectable PEDs."
And next to [Chris Paul intentionally fouling Dwight Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UajWOxOXo)
"He was absolutely not as developed with the lakers as he became last year with the clippers. As well, they had Dwight Howard / AD combo last year which is just insanely better. There was no use for him to be around last year."
shaq is a far better player than dwight howard.   who would you take in 2008?  better to go with a cheaper shaq?

One of the highlights of the Bubble last year was watching Goga stand up to Dwight Howard.
Steph's rebounding is incredibly underrated  dude boxed out Dwight Howard
Bam survives if he runs into the shoulders of anyone not Dwight Howard.
"I think people get a little too big on players and mentors.. how many times has dwight howard studied under hakeem etc.. i think in most cases, players will become who they are and influence doesnt make much of a dent"
Just have Dwight Howard and AD.
I'm pretty sure I could get Dwight Howard and Marcus Morris for less than that and probably add on another piece for that 200M üòÇ
"""Dwight Howard shot 100% from 3 in the 2020 leading the Lakers to the title, why isn't this considered the greatest 3Pt shooting series of all time?"""
Is it a stretch to say he's most athletic 7 footer since Dwight Howard
"Because it makes for a worse league with bad contracts filling up cap space while the team stays the same or worse.  Mitchell and Gobert aren't bringing a title to Utah. Their salaries will also make sure they can't bring in another great player to help them be true contenders. So now they're a worse version of Stockton-Malone Jazz.  The other problem is owners then holding the players by the balls before new CBAs. Players want to get paid, stupid owners give them fat contracts and then whine about losing money on bad contracts because the team isn't going anywhere because the maxed out player isn't playing as good as the money he's getting.Then we get those lockouts looming every few years over the same shit because owners know they're overpaying players and the players don't wanna give it up.  Stoudemire, Carmelo, Al Horford, Dwight Howard, Paul Milsap, Joe Johnson, Deron Williams, Rashard Lewis, Chris Bosh, Elton Brand, Michael Redd... these are just some of the guys who were in the top10 salary wise in the last 10 years and they were never worth it. And that doesn' t even include guys like Mozgov or Deng who are memes at this point.  I don't mind guys getting paid, the amount of money going around NBA is insane and I'm happy for them but we see the same shit all the time- guy plays good for 3 years, somebody gives him max or near max and their production stays the same while the team is stagnating and they can't bring in another player because the salaries don't match and nobody wants to take him on anyway."
"A Warriors beat writer did some nice analysis looking at other fresh-out-of-high school bigs, and even guys we regard as very good defenders (Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler) were mediocre at best as rookies on defense. It's just a big adjustment to make,"
Shaqs a hater cuz he's over 7 foot and got an average sized willy. Id be mad too.   But keep dissing chuck and Dwight Howard. Rudy has done nothing to anyone.
"I wanted Charlotte to do whatever it takes to get Wiseman and avoid Ball at all costs.  Ball has been much better than I anticipated so far, but I hate that we couldn't find a way to move up.  Charlotte has missed all of Shaq, Dwight Howard, CP3, Aldridge, Anthony Davis by a single pick, and wound up with Mourning (can't complain really), Okafor, Felton, Morrison, and MKG with the very next pick (all top 5 picks). Any one of those five legends completely changes the course of the franchise. It honestly would not shock me if Wiseman became an all-star level center. Melo is quite interesting at the moment but I don't know how likely it is for him to reach a star level."
"I picked 12 guys in no particular order that I think are better, it's not that I can't think of more: Duncan, Frazier, Wade, Dumars, Moncrief, Bruce Bowen, Rasheed Wallace, Kareem, Mark Eaton, Dwight Howard  Not trying to shit on Draymond; in many ways I think he's underrated, but ""top 5 all-time"" is nephew talk"
"&gt; and an arguable top 5 defender all time  No doubt he is an all time great, but I don't see how you could realistically put him above players like Russell, Wilt, Pippen, Rodman, Duncan, Garnett, Hakeem, Wallace, Howard, etc.    Yes he can guard 1-5, but he does so in an era that significantly disfavors bigs and has all but eliminated the traditional NBA center.  Almost all of the elite teams over the past decade have relied near-exclusively on small ball lineups.   I seriously doubt he would be able to defend Shaq, Hakeem, Robinson, Ewing (or even prime Dwight, Duncan and Garnett) and so forth at an elite level."
"We‚Äôve also gone from Brown to Doc, which is looking like going from Kidd to Budd. The Sixers were also missing Ben in the playoffs. They‚Äôve also finally gotten bench players, in particular a backup for Joel in Dwight Howard.    Acting like ‚Äúthe Sixers added two shooters so I can‚Äôt imagine them being better than my team‚Äù is the real simpleton argument here."
Of course! I'm saying I would not be shocked like I would have been 20 years ago seeing some of the shots players take today.  Watching guys like Dwight Howard or McGee suddenly shoot threes is so fucking weird considering they came in as guys who basically were not allowed to touch hte ball outside the paint. Dirk was a novelty as a shooting big man. The game has changed so much.
"&gt; heavily underrating prime klay and Dray  Klay and Dray did not truly make a leap into ""elite"" territory until the 2016 season.  Klay was the second best scorer on the Dubs and in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 playoffs he averaged 15,16 and 18ppg. Those are just straight up average numbers for someone expected to share a burden of the scoring load. The Warriors don't even make it past the Rockets in the 2015 WCF when both Ariza and Dwight Howard outplayed Klay, who averaged 17ppg to Steph's 31ppg.  I've watched the Warriors since the 2001 21-win team, followed Steph since Davidson and watched both the rise of Klay and Draymond supplanting David Lee in Kerr's system.  There is absolutely no way in hell Klay and Dray were close to carrying Curry between 2013-2015, and no way in hell they sniff the WCF in 2015 let alone the Finals without Steph.  You wanna know what the hot takes were between 2013-2016?  - ""Klay would be average on any other team, outside of Steph's gravity and Kerr's system. He's basically a glorified Kyle Korver with better defense. He'll never be a primary scoring option.""  - ""Draymond Green would be average on any other team. He can't score consistently enough and is replaceable with pretty much any traditional big. He looks better than he does because he's surrounded with the best backcourt in the league.""  Yeah...the other two guys always mentioned in the same breath as Steph were being clowned as ""role players"" who would be nothing without Steph or GSW's system. And yet you want to try to convince the people who were watching these games 7-8 years ago that Klay and Dray were HOFers from the moment they set foot on the floor with Steph? FOH. Obviously, Klay and Dray took the next step in 2016, but prior to that they were parts in a system in which Steph was the engine. Put those three together and the system was always much greater than the sum of its parts, but absolutely none of it works without Curry at all.  Even the 2016 Warriors (who were ""stacked"") en route to winning 73 games in the regular season had a straight up NEGATIVE offensive rating ANY TIME Steph was off the floor. I don't know how anyone can forget the starters building a 20+ point lead through 3 quarters, then when just Steph (Klay still rotated into the 2nd team quite a bit) sat out that lead would evaporate and Kerr would have to throw Steph back in to keep the offense from looking lost.  So please - next time you are trying to convince people that they're ""underrating prime Klay and Dray"" actually make sure those people weren't watching those very same players more closely than you and/or state some facts to support your argument, cause the numbers don't lie; Steph carried his teammates, especially so in 2015."
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
"Yeah, before Steph coaches would bench you for fastbreak pullup threes. Now? I'm not shocked if Dwight fucking Howard launches them. Steph changed (broke?) the game we all knew"
"Just off the top of my head, guys that are candidates for the top 5 are Bill Russell, MJ, Scottie, Dennis Rodman, Hakeem, Gary Payton, Tim Duncan, and Dikembe Mutombo. Guys like Kawhi, Dwight Howard, and Big Ben peaked high, but don‚Äôt have the crazy longevity of the top 5 candidates."
"It's also why I hate Bill Simmons. The guy really doesn't understand that by having such a promenent voice in basketball that he can create narratives and therefore cause players issues.  Look at Dwight Howard, the guy was an integral part of the Lakers defence in the playoffs, and really caused Jokic a lot of issues until the 4th quarter when the Lakers would switch to Anthony Davis, and everytime Bill talks about him on his podcast he calls Dwight.  ""Weird.""  ""Phony""  ""Unplayable in the playoffs.""   It's like you're actually messing with this dudes money, his legacy and other things in the future. Give it a fucking break."
"Lmfao yeah dude please keep telling yourself that, there‚Äôs not one person on this planet who‚Äôs going to do anything but laugh in your face if you say Dwight Howard in 2013 with LAL then 2014 with Houston was better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Jamal, Lou Will, and Reddick in their prime   Zero nba knowledge you hate to see it"
"The game when Chris Bosh's girlfriend started taunting the Cavs. There are lots of incidents like this throughout the course of the season that don't make headlines.   I remember a couple years ago the Cavs were on a one game losing streak and getting hammered in the media as a result. In the next game vs Charlotte, the Hornets built a lead and Dwight Howard started to talking to Lebron from the bench. You can clearly see him say ""You're not making the playoffs"" to Lebron which is what people like Skip were saying on TV the day before. Anyways Lebron went for 40 that night. Here is the box score: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201803280CHO.html"
"Lmfao you think the Dwight Howard Harden played with was anywhere close to his hall of fame or even all-star form? Bro you clearly don't know what you are talking about, Dwight was so washed by then the Lakers fans are still angry they even signed him before his Houston stint, Westbrook was also below par when he was in Houston, check the numbers, that's why nobody was trying to deal for him, and CP3? Literally the only time he got to the conf finals was with Harden, where he then got hurt as they were about to move on  You can't make the case CP3 is a winner because he hasn't won, even with more talent than other guys, those Clippers teams unseated Kobe and the Lakers as the best team in LA for years, he had Blake, DeAndre Jordan and Jamal Crawford and Lou Will, those Clippers teams were deep and talented and always picked to contend  Please do yourself a favor and research your opinions bro lmao you clearly don't know what you're talking about"
Anyone notice how huge Wiseman is? Looks like a mini Dwight Howard out there
Ice Cold Pandemic P loves to be the best player by being Dwight Howard-tier on any team.  A real hold-me-back kind of guy
Dwight Howard?
Nets have no interior defense. They should of signed Dwight Howard.
It‚Äôs annoying that Dwight Howard is now the greatest interior defender all time according to r/lakers when that‚Äôs not even the reason we‚Äôre losing this game
"I really wonder how that would have worked. The Lakers would have given up Odom and Pau to get CP3, and then presumably they would have eventually made that same trade of Bynum and picks to get Dwight Howard. But Dwight was never really the same guy after that back surgery he got his last year in Orlando. Would Kobe, CP3 and Dwight have worked well enough to win it all? Keep in mind this was right in the middle of the Heatles run with those 2013-14 Spurs coming on and KD was still in OKC."
"To support your point, if championship rings defined winners and losers, Boogie Cousins is a winner.  Dwight Howard is a winner.  This can't be right."
"Excellent recap. It‚Äôs easy to play ‚Äòarmchair GM,‚Äô but at some point, if multiple teams are passing on you, despite your talent, that should tell you it must be *REALLY* worrisome.   Doesn‚Äôt mean a person can‚Äôt change (look at Dwight Howard last season for the Lakers), but it does mean the level of risk was way too much for any potential reward for those teams.   Hope he‚Äôs figured it out and lets his talent shine through. He obviously has plenty of that to go around."
"So the worst Harden team was the 2016 Rockets, they finished 0.500 and barely squeaked into the 8 seed.   That team had Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley, and Dwight Howard. While that's not a great supporting cast, that's not abject trash.   The 2nd worst team (by win percentage) was the 2020 team. They also had Tucker, Gordon, and Covington. That's not trash, that's a solid sample of decent 3 &amp; D players."
"Well coming into the league Javale was scary. Javale had a 32 inch Vert with a 7'7 wingspan while sitting at 7 feet tall(9.7 standing reach). Making him pretty comparable to someone like Dwight Howard in terms of body size + athletic ability Javale had a much higher standing reach but Dwight had a higher Vert making Javale another ""superman"" type player. Shaq hasn't ever done well when it came to other bigs who had athletic ability he's always been petty towards them."
"Dwight Howard is 35 and can still do his whole kiss the rim routine, Zion is mostly likely playing smarter and not just trying to jump out of the building every time, and like other people have said defenses are playing tighter on him after seeing what he can do if given space by the rim, once he‚Äôs in the air no ones stopping him"
But 34-38 is old dude... and Harden will be that during his next contract. What will he command first off and honestly what 35 year old player sans Lebron is good rn? Can‚Äôt even think of anyone tbh... maybe CP3 but he‚Äôs on his last legs. Aldridge? Dwight Howard? There aren‚Äôt many stars that are still stars after 34.
"Nah man its gotta be Cody Rhodes, Dwight Howard, Caleb Swannigan, Daniel Gafford, Mother F*cker, and Nevada"
This is my take as well. A Dwight Howard type that could keep teams honest in the paint.  Maybe there's a deal for Capela?
The dudes who are on steroids never get caught. It‚Äôs those who take contaminated OTC workout supplements that get popped all the time.   Anyone who thinks John Collins is on more juice than Dwight Howard is an idiot.

"The Dwight Howard trade derailed 4 franchises.   Nuggets: Iggy bolted after one year. They went on to miss the playoffs 5 straight years.  76ers: Was so bad it started ""The Process.""  Lakers: Dwight left. Missed the playoffs 6 years in a row.   Magic: Win by default due to Vucevic. Missed the playoffs 6 years in a row."
Dwight Howard for Andrew Bynum for whatever Orlando got.
Idk man you ever get a whiff of a 4th quarter Dwight Howard armpit after he‚Äôs scored 5 points and committed 6 fouls.
Dwight Howard. He constantly talks.
Dwight Howard might have the best male body in the world
"We tried lmao. We just got fucking hoed by injuries every time. Dwight howard, chris paul. Both got hit by major injuries at the worst time in the playoffs (and coincidentally both against the dubs in the wcf)  And we coulda had jimmy in 2018 if thibs didn't veto the trade cuz he thought the wolves would be fighting for a playoff spot with the rockets (tf??)"
Dwight Howard isn't a valuable player?  There are many ways to impact a game.
They have a dude who is averaging 27/5/5 on 50/40/100 and apparently he needs to be traded for Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard for sure
" &gt;Turner and a free agent for 11 mill does not have even half of the impact of Gobert, the Jazz‚Äôs best player.    11M gets you Avery Bradley and Dwight Howard or Derrick Favors or Serge Ibaka ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"what was DET supposed to do, let him walk in FA? He was never a Dwight Howard or Yao type center but he‚Äôs a Center that‚Äôs worth 20 mill at least. You need centers like him esp teams like BKN"
"literally says ""for a shooter""  &amp;#x200B;  League wide average takes in fucking Dwight Howard."
Young 2011 howard before his back problems had the foot speed for all but the shiftiest guards who will always get their buckets and was putting up historical rim protection and block numbers. AD is fucking hall of fame level defender young dwight was generational.
So I‚Äôll just go with the 3 advanced stats I will list every time since 2000 someone was in the top 3 in all of the advanced stats  2019-2020 Giannis DPOY  2018-2019 Giannis 1st Team  2016-2017 Draymond DPOY  2015-2016 Kawhi DPOY  2013-2014 Joakim Noah DPOY  2010-2011 Kevin Garnett 1st Team  2009-2010 Dwight Howard DPOY  2008-2009 Lebron James 1st Team  2007-2008 Kevin Garnett DPOY  2006-2007 Tim Duncan 1st Team Ben Wallace 2nd Team  2005-2006 Ben Wallace DPOY  2003-2004 Kevin Garnett 1st team  Tim Duncan 1st Team Ben Wallace 2nd Team  2002-2003 Ben Wallace DPOY  2001-2002 Ben Wallace DPOY  This feat has been achieved in the last 14 years 9 of those times that person won DPOY  Every time the person made 1st team unless someone at their position also was top 3 in all of the advanced defensive stats  In summary if the season ended today historically speaking myles turner would at least be on the first team
I remember there was a rumor that Shannon Brown slept with Pau Gasols girlfriend after they got swept by Dallas. Brown got traded to Phoenix that offseason &amp; the Lakers were trying to to acquire both Dwight Howard &amp; Chris Paul to form their big 3 but CP3 deal was vetoed. Dwight was next.
Dwight Howard and Josh Smith
Gilbert Arenas and Dwight Howard
"Sure, but if he hasn't been able to develop a decent shot in the last decade or so of his playing career then the odds are not in his favor. It'd be like hoping Dwight Howard (56.5% FT shooter) would learn how to shoot 3s later in his career. Really good shooters tend to have a natural talent for it which they learned when they were young.  Could happen but it's more likely he doesn't figure it out. I think if Simmons starts shooting he'd probably be like a 30-33% 3 point shooter at best."
"Ben Simmons could just take the Dwight Howard path and be a perennial first team all defense and hopefully win a DPOY or two to give him a real at the HoF. JoJo's time might have already passed, to many injuries which has lead him to missing way to many games."
I swear there's a video out there where he calls Robin Lopez the best center in the league over Dwight Howard during Dwight's career season in 2011/2012. Shaq petty af.
"Their worst matchups in my opinion are the Lakers, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers (in that order) and theres a world where they have to face 3 of these teams in one playoff run. Their biggest problem, at least in my opinion, is rim protection so its important to look at the teams that will feast at the rim.  The Lakers will absolutely be able to feast against the Nets at the rim and it gets even worse when you think about the minutes where they will have to have a backup center in the game going up against Monrezl Harrell. Can you really trust a guy like Claxton against not only Harrell but against the other players coming off the bench for the Lakers. Not to mention that Lebron/AD will be playing most of the game and theres nobody on the team that can defend AD at all. Tough matchup for the Nets and I feel that they would have a better time in next years playoffs if its against the Nets.  On the Bucks it is entirely possible that Jrue, Giannis, and Khris work together to contain James or Kyrie and negate some of the guard offense that Brooklyn will be reliant on, but even if they don't there isn't anyone on the team who can stop Giannis. They're going to have to build an even tighter wall than we've ever seen and this will allow Middleton and Holiday to put up big numbers. This is a series where Deandre Jordan could foul out easily in every single game and leave the Nets scrambling for extra paint defense. Honestly an incredibly tough matchup, but one where I can see the Nets coming out on top because of their absolutely insane offensive potential.  The Clippers have as ideal of a lineup as you can ask for against a team with an elite offensive PG, SG, and forward. Beverley, PG, and Kawhi on Kyrie, Harden, and Durant is about as good as you're going to find in the league and with a guy like Serge Ibaka backing them up that's going to at least present a bigger challenge for the Nets than 95% of teams can present. The issue with the Clippers is honestly the same with the Nets. Both teams are going to be reliant on guys who disappear in the playoffs, guys who are prone to injury and on a team with guys who understand the heaps of pressure being put on them. The Clippers and Lakers being the two western favorites is pretty much the least ideal situation Brooklyn could ask for.  The 76ers are basically the anti-Nets. They're super defensive and play above the rim. Theres a world where Simmons is on KD, and then you figure the rest out from there, with Embiid locking up the paint. Who can guard Embiid on this team? This is a series where Dwight Howard can actually put up 10 pts, 10 rebs off the bench and Shake can average 13-16 ppg off the bench. I would bet the house on the Nets winning this series but there is a world where we see the Sixers looking completely unstoppable at the rim.  I would bet on the Nets getting to the finals and losing, then looking better next year after getting more front court depth."
Dwight Howard?
Andrew Bynum. But he was praising him while shitting on Dwight Howard so not sure if that counts
"&gt;Dwight Howard, CP3, Russ and John Wall disagree.  Everyone who has ever played with him seems to disagree."
"I think Shaq and Chuck criticize Embiid because they think he's not playing up to his potential, which tbf a lot of the time they have a point.  Shaq going after Dwight Howard was low though. Like I get it, he stole your schtick but telling him he's not a true big man because he lacks a post-game was just wrong."
"He is very shy and reserved in person. He loves kids. At the season ticket holder events...when he went which was not every year. He would spend much more time with kids on the floor than adults.  When you caught him off guard...not at something scheduled...he was very friendly and outgoing. You could tell he felt uncomfortable at scheduled events with fans expecting some time around him.  Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Dwight Howard were the opposite when they were here. I felt like Westbrook would have been offended had I not high fives him hard and with a full hand. Harden high fives fans like a dead fish or even bumped his wrist in place of a hand. I got the feeling sometimes like maybe he is a germaphobe at least around fans?"
"Yes and no. The rockets got Harden Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. The Pelicans didn‚Äôt seem like they were willing to spend. I mean they don‚Äôt even have their own medical staff"
I think Embiid is more offensively versatile than Dwight ever was.  When Howard played with Harden he was past his prime too and no longer the 3 time DPOY he was on that end.
&gt; We haven't seen Harden play with an Embiid type.  I mean he played with Dwight Howard
Having a high standing reach and wingspan is better than just being tall. Dwight Howard measured is much shorter than certain dudes but his high shoulders and long wingspan make up for it. Allows him to play bigger than he is.
"Dwight ""Mickey"" Howard"
"Yeah, all three of those guys were amazing the year prior. Nash was an All-Star and averaged 13 points, 11 assists on career-high 53% shooting. Kobe was basically still at his prime and got 28/5/5. And Dwight Howard was only 26 years old and averaged 21 pts and 15 rebounds while being one of the best defenders in the league. Plus people are forgetting they still had prime Pau Gasol who was only 31. And a still decent Ron Artest. Technically their starting line-up was five all-stars. That team was ridiculously stacked on paper.  In fact they were the preseason betting favorites to win the West and basically tied with the LeBron/Wade/Bosh Miami Heat to win the championship. From that to barely scraping into the playoffs, never contending, and swept in the first round has got to be the most dissappointing season ever."
He‚Äôs unguardable when he wants to be. Lakers had success against him by not necessarily guarding him well but by sending in big goon Dwight Howard to just arm wrestle and foul him continuously until Jokic got frustrated.  Mythical Frustrated Jokic ticky-tac fouls a lot and turns the ball over like crazy.   He‚Äôs clearly in the best physical shape he‚Äôs been probably ever and his increased counting stats and efficiency reflects that even if his surrounding teammates have had declining play.
"They get along well for the most part. Chuck always makes shaq laugh his ass off. He literally falls off his chair laughing at chucks jokes. But the second chuck makes a small jab against shaq in a joking way, like ‚Äúshaq been looking like a bean bag‚Äù, shaq loses it and is so petty, he just brags about his rings. He is the most sensitive person in the nba. He‚Äôs also the most jealous. He bullied Dwight Howard for a decade because people said Dwight was like a young shaq. He bullied javale McGhee for messing up a few plays for years. And now he bullied gobert everyday for having a 200m contract. He walks off the set because they photoshopped shaq on Kobe‚Äôs shoulders. The man is a little kid."
Prime Dwight Howard. Great rim protection and very quick hands and athletic for switches.
"Guys like Embiid and Jokic are the exceptions that prove the rule. The Warriors won 3 rings with JaVale McGee and Zaza Pachulia, the Rockets with Harden found a new gear when they went full time small ball. It's not the 90s-early 2000s anymore where you need a good center to contend. Post moves have been mostly legislated out of the game.    Roy Hibbert went from an all-star to out of the league in a few years, Dwight Howard went from Superman to a journeyman (I love him on this team but that's just what he is now), Jahlil Okafor is barely in the league after winning a national title and getting picked #3 overall.    The centers who are the best players on their teams need to have some kind of transcendental skill. Jokic is a full-fledged point center, Embiid can take over games with Harden-like offense, Davis is a terror on both ends. But if you can get a 7 footer who can get his arms up and give you 6 fouls you can win if you have other stars.    The Nets will be fine with Jordan and Noah Vonleh or someone like that, they already got the hard part out of the way."
"As much as Shaq hates it, he‚Äôd be exactly what Dwight Howard was in Orlando. The big guy that draws 2 defenders in the lane to open up wing shooters.  With modern zone defense, it would make catching passes in the right spot a lot more difficult, but he‚Äôd still win every matchup. The problem is that 3pt percentages are so good now that running post plays over and over won‚Äôt win you games unless you‚Äôre at least 60%, if not more.  Shaq would still be great, and he would have the ability to average 30, but no coach would give him the opportunity."
"You really gotta look at this from the perspective of 2012. Even then this is still not a great take, but it's a lot more reasonable than people are making it out to be.  Kevin Martin had been a borderline all star level player for several seasons, from 2007-2011 he averaged 22.4 points per game on 60% true shooting. He had a relatively down year in 2012, but he was still only 28 and the Thunder were ready to contend right then. Jeremy Lamb was a lottery pick a few months earlier and was an extremely recognizable prospect as he had been the number two guy on a championship just a year earlier his freshman year.   These guys were not viewed as scraps like they are today, the perspective at the time was they were getting a player who could at least somewhat replicate Harden's production in the short term in Martin, a pretty decent prospect in Lamb, and two future firsts. Obviously with hindsight we know that Martin's 2012 wasn't just an anomaly and instead the start of his decline, Lamb never amounted to much until several years after he had left OKC, and that Harden immediately was an All NBA player.  As someone in that thread put it too, compare *that* return to the package Dwight Howard, a legit top 3 player in the league who was 26 years old, fetched just a few months earlier."
"I mean, CP3 is still pretty much killing it, he was All-NBA 2nd team last year.  And Harden got to play with his best buddy Russell Westbrook, former MVP, that he pushed the Rockets to trade for because he didn't like that CP3 wanted him to do literally anything but stand around at half-court on possessions where Harden didn't have the ball.  harden also had Dwight Howard, MVP runner up and All-NBA 2nd team player while he was in Houston.  Let's stop with this nonsense trope that Harden has never had quality teammates, he's had tons of help and has run all of them out of town.  Also D-Wade was young &amp; not nearly at his peak when the Heat won in 2006, Shaq was a legit MVP candidate that year."
"What? Harden made the WCFs in 2015 when his second best teammate was a quickly declining and often injured Dwight Howard. He also notably never missed the playoffs in his Houston career. AD made the playoffs like twice in 7 seasons, and only won one playoff series."
"You maybe correct.  But just to justify my take. In 2012, the biggest free agent was Dwight Howard and he was adamant to go to nets. You also got williams who at the time was considered a top 3 pg behind cp3 and maybe rondo.  So nets being a destination is not that new.   nets did a comparable trade to what happened yesterday, traded all the picks for pierce and garnet. After two years they ended up a 20 something win team for a few years.   Now you are right the gm and owner are much better now. However kyrie is a proven wild card. Kd is not guaranteed to stay specially if he loses.   Maybe harden will stay?  In the meantime, you have no cap space or draft picks. So if they do all leave you have to rebuild from scratch. And i dont know many stars that have signed up to a situation like that. Most likely you will over pay a good play and lock you self in mediocrity."
"When I first got into the nba, my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me stay up late enough to watch the western conference games so what made me fall in love with the association was the eastern conference circa 2009-2012  Celtics: Loved Watching Rondo facilitate to Kg, Paul, and Ray Bulls: D Rose was an exciting of a player as I‚Äôve ever seen, plus I loved the way Joakim Noah played  Magic: Prime Dwight Howard killing shit with Hedo, Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Ryan Anderson Heat: LeBron, Wade, Bosh were on another level Pacers: Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, Lance  Sixers: Young Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala  Knicks: Melo and Amari    Even liked watching the not so good teams like the Cavs with Young Kyrie or the Wizards with young John Wall"
"Sure but peak Westbrook isn‚Äôt on the wizards rn, so frankly it‚Äôs ridiculous to put the wizards duo on the same level as dame and cj. It‚Äôs like calling the 2020 Lakers a super team because they had Howard, AD and LBJ. Dwight was a good role player for them, but he‚Äôs no where near what he was a decade ago."
That's why Dwight Howard is making 26 million this year while Jrue Holiday is making league minimum
"Yes and not a single one said he had a bad work ethic, in fact CP3 said he practiced too much and would have to be dragged out of the gym.   Also way to go ignoring context:   Dwight Howard fought w everyone and was almost out of the league after Houston.   CP3 was constantly injured and was a shell of himself in the 2019 playoffs, crazy how there weren‚Äôt as many issues when he performed to his level in 2018 huh.    Westbrook underperformed heavy in the playoffs and it was clear they wouldn‚Äôt win.    Can‚Äôt I say the same thing about Jimmy Butler?"
LeBron lost to the Dwight Howard led Magic in 2009. Kobe beat them in 5 games.
Dwight Howard has a better resume as a number 1 guy than Harden does though.
"How about a Jeremy Lin, Dwight Howard, CP3 or Russel Westbrook Rockets Jersey still counts?"
"Nba players and especially explosive big men peak young.  Amare, Shawn Kemp, Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard all peaked in their early to mid-twenties.  The average NBA [player peaks around 25 -27 anyway] (https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+aging+curve&amp;rlz=1C1ZCEB_enUS844US844&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=UYVHseMgW8Kv1M%252CjGPXmf38DGarYM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRnOMpfp27ZP4pdxMmIkIZkDA-zhA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-iuuX2pvuAhUXFlkFHfrQBPIQ9QF6BAgOEAE&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=598#imgrc=UYVHseMgW8Kv1M), we tend to overvalue experience and undervalue youth."
"Lmao you‚Äôre joking right?   Let‚Äôs pull up a pic of Kevin mchale real quick, and then let‚Äôs put Dwight Howard next to him, and you tell me we haven‚Äôt biologically evolved... lmao üòÇ   How did this get upvoted ???  Barkley ate like 4 Pizza Hut pizzas a day, and drank a pack of Budweiser....  It‚Äôs called evolution  Did you not watch the last dance ??? Jordan wore shoes from ONLY 10 years before for his last MSG game, and said his feet were soaked in blood after ...and that was only ten years later .....and you know damn well he prolly only wore those shoes one other time before    Yes Larry Bird, and LBJ are totally physically the same as far as SF‚Äôs go lol ....lbj just must have had better ‚Äúphysical training‚Äù than Larry. Since ya know, iron weights have changed and evolved so much....  You do realize the chicken nuggets kids are eating have growth hormones that we didn‚Äôt have as kids right? If you truly don‚Äôt think we are biologically evolving you are quite naive"
"Til Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard, and Jokim Noah are small euro guys"
"Hardly any at all, Simmons plays heavy minutes with Dwight Howard and Matisse Thybulle who are both awful shooters, the reason behind this disparity is because the Sixers have no one else to create besides Simmons on the roster"
"Ronnie was never better as a NBA prospect over KG. He was just a better HS player. I have a similar story against Randolph Morris, Josh Smith, and Dwight Howard. Morris was the best of the three but he was never on their level in terms of NBA prospect and it's clear why. They keep massively getting better and he peaked."
"You could turn him into 2009 Dwight Howard at worst:  Have him crash the boards, block shots, catch lobs and dunk while being surrounded by good shooters"
"CJ McCollum will get into the basketball media as well and be awesome. Then again, ESPN will probably pass them both up and hire Dwight Howard or some shit."
he fouled out against old ass Dwight Howard nah bro
"Yeah, it's almost as if NBA defenses were much better than HS ones :) you could even say it's almost as if most HS players were short af compared to your typical NBA big!  That being said AI and CP3 still had a few nasty dunks in the NBA. Hell, CP3 posterized *Dwight Howard!*"
"That's the same reasoning that resulted in guys like Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond thinking they need more post touches because they were shooting such a high percentage, when those 'shots' were wide open dunks half the time. When in reality their PPP on post touches is well below league average efficiency. Looking at overall shooting percentage isn't logical, it's about individual expected result based on the context of the possession."
Dwight Howard is better than Joel Embiid. Just compare their careers.
I got a slightly used Dwight Howard if you want him.

I skipped a bunch and also left out some duplicates for players."
Did Dwight Howard just steal the ball midair from OG?! Lmao
Can we at least borrow Dwight Howard for this matchup??
"here's my hot take: The only reason beside injuries why CP3 ain't a top 5 player is his size.   ppl been saying what if Iverson were 6'3, what if IT weren't a midget.  The real question is what if Chris Paul is 6'6. He would be another fucking Lebron.  He has all the BBIQ, the skills, the mentality, the control of the game,  and he is a way better shooter too. And pre-injury he fucking posterized Dwight Howard.   Dude almost has the complete package. Only thing he lacks is he size, or, more realistically, some luck."
Go to Philly. I just watched Dwight Howard play and he's done.
What about Omer Asik and Dwight Howard in Houston 2013?
Dwight Howard.
"The Sixers should sign him just to keep him away from another contender. He'd be perfect for Simmons when Embiid's off the floor, too, or even next to Howard whenever Dwight rests both Simmons and Embiid."
Yo yo any of y‚Äôall remember the blazer v rockets series when robin got totally abused by Dwight Howard?
"He can be our Dwight Howard 2, backing up Dwight Howard"
I‚Äôve been saying this since the day it happened but our fan base acted like Harrell was mini Shaq. Fucking casuals don‚Äôt even watch other teams.   Should have: resigned Dwight Howard and paid Ibaka.
Dwight Howard truth gang representing
Don‚Äôt get me started ... this team misses Dwight Howard to the nth degree
"Gobert wasn't 2nd, he wasn't in the list at all before reaching an egibility criteria. He'll enter several other lists in the next few weeks rather high including blocks % (probably 8th instead of Camby) and rebounds % (should be 5th between DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard)."
"RIP to one of the Top 3 Bullets/Wizards players in history, WES UNSELD!  Westley Sissel Unseld or better known as WES UNSELD, ranks up with Elvin Hayes and John Wall as the greatest D.C./Baltimore mainstays in history. We can cover some of the famous feats like his Rookie-MVP season in 1969, or the championship ring he muscled his teammates to in 1978, but I'm going to cover his accolades making the team's age squad, in typical age-squad-guy fashion:  ‚Ä¢	Wes is easily the best Center in franchise history. He is their best Center at the ages of ... 22-24, 26, 28-29, &amp; 32-34, and made the 30-31 squads as a 6th selection.  ‚Ä¢	Wes is absolutely the BEST franchise player from the ages 22-24... let's highlight why:  ‚Ä¢	In this period, Unseld received the MVP award in his rookie season, received the 8th most votes for the award the following season (1970), and then made his 2nd all-star game the year after (1971).   ‚Ä¢	Wes racked up 31.9 Win Shares in his first 3 seasons (still age 22-24 folks). Of the 28 players to rack up more than Unseld in this span, only Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, and Wes have a majority of those win shares come from DEFENSE.  ‚Ä¢	Usually with young stars, they are dumping out astronomical stats on cellar dwellers, but Wes' Bullets were 57-25 in his rookie season. By his 3rd campaign, they ran roughshod through the regular season at 42-40, but still ended up making the NBA Finals! (Unseld would make 3 more Finals after that).  ‚Ä¢	The only player to put up better numbers during a similar age-frame was Walt Bellamy who played during the infamous 1962 surge and for a miserably failing Chicago Zephyrs team (where the Wizards originated).  ‚Ä¢	John Wall, Phil Chenier, Chris Webber, Terry Dischinger, Earl Monroe, Bradley Beal, Gilbert Arenas, and Walt Bellamy are all special players for the Wizards in that particular age-frame, but none touch the Wide U."
Oldest great still playing: LeBron  Baby goat: Doncic  Lamar:Harden  Donald: Giannis  Deshaun: KAT  Best Duo: LeBron and AD  Fastest player: DeAaron Fox  Strong for position: Marcus Smart  Drew Brees: Dwight howard  Barry Sanders: Chris paul  Jamarcus Russell: Darko Milicic
"At an individual level I would look at the style of play that Harden was playing through. This was before Dantoni turned James into a full time point guard but Harden‚Äôs usage rate was 31.3% where Curry at that time was at a 29% rate. Harden led the Rockets in scoring at 27 a game as well as led the team in assists at 7 a game. Harden‚Äôs second best player (a post back injury Dwight Howard) missed half the season and only averaged 29 minute a game when in. Harden had to deal with a multitude of different starting lineups due to injuries to Dwight, Terrence Jones, Ariza, and Beverly, that resulted in 6 different lineups just within the first 13 games. The Rockets still had a 10-3 record to start the year and the only player who was available for all those games was Harden. Within that same 13 game stretch, the warriors had the same lineup for all but 1 game where Harrison Barnes was out. Harden had to deal with a multitude of injuries to his support throughout the entire season where the starting 5 for the warriors were all together for at least 67 games of the season (Bogut missing the most time of the 5).  Harden was working with guys like Kostas Pap, Donatas Montejunas, Isaiah Cannan, Joey Dorsey and Correy Brewer for 50+ games and still somehow managed to crack 56 wins and a second seed.   The Warriors were awful last year but we can‚Äôt look past the moves that we‚Äôre made that makes this team better than last year‚Äôs. A 19 point game scorer last year in Kelly Oubre, a decent back up point in brad Wanamaker (which I know he‚Äôs been bad to start the year but he was solid in Boston), a rookie in wiseman that has added spark when playing, Kent Bazemors who adds outside shooting and versatility along the wing, and of course another year of development for guys like Paschel, Lee, and JT that have all looked better this season.   Curry is still dealing with a mid level team and I have no doubt they‚Äôll be top 4 in the west next year with Klay back but to act like Curry is dealing with one of the worst teams or situations is going a little OD."
"**CONTINUED**  **9)** MORE ABOUT HIS OFFENSE: Fans often knock Russell for not being a high scorer. He played on a team that spread around the scoring, so very few Celtics ever had big scoring numbers, and he often had the best FG% on the team. Russell was top-5 in FG% in the league 4 times, while more recent dominant-scoring centers Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Patrick Ewing all did it once. Russell understood what individual sacrifices to make and how to improve his teammates so they collectively would be winners, which is why he won the 1962 MVP ([voting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1962.html)) over Wilt Chamberlain (*his epic 50 ppg &amp; 26 rpg season*) and Oscar Robertson (*his epic triple-double season*). By the way, Russell holds the record for the most consecutive MVP awards (3), most consecutive top-2 MVP finishes (6), and has the 2nd most MVP‚Äôs of all-time (5). **It was clear that Russell‚Äôs approach was far more valuable to his team‚Äôs success than that of other superstars with monster stats.**  **10)** DEFENSIVE IMPACT: There is no hyperbole in saying Russell was *unquestionably* the most impactful defensive player ever. The Celtics consistently &amp; regularly had the #1 defense in the NBA throughout his career, yet they were FAR worse before he joined the team, and they immediately dropped in the ‚Äò70 season right after he retired.

He had an overwhelmingly positive influence on the entire team‚Äôs defense to a degree we‚Äôve never seen from any other player.  **11)** ATHLETICISM: Watching film of Russell, it‚Äôs clear he was extremely fast and active, elite even by today‚Äôs standards. He also possessed Olympic-level leaping ability (*[7th ranked high jumper in the world in 1956](https://trackandfieldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-mHJRank.pdf)*). For the record, he was measured as 6-ft-9-and-‚Öù without shoes, taller than both Dwight Howard and Alonzo Mourning. This incredible athleticism is what allowed his defense to be a cross between Tim Duncan &amp; Kevin Garnett, covering everything everywhere with phenomenal explosiveness, plus impeccable timing &amp; decision-making.  **12)** LEADERSHIP: Bill Russell had the best combination of elite on-court impact on team synergy *plus* elite locker-room unity &amp; positivity. *Very* few guys are even in the discussion of having this type of elite combo: Tim Duncan, Jerry West, Larry Bird ‚Ä¶. not many more, especially when you also consider a player‚Äôs impact on his team‚Äôs defensive synergy."

Bynum is younger than Dwight Howard
Kinda odd to claim to know absolutely nothing about basketball but then bring up dwight howard...
"Not really. The dude ran, jumped, and dunked. Dwight Howard has done it from farther and better."
"I actually finished control last night great atmosphere if you're into the SCP foundation terrible game tho. You need to finish the DLC to actually see the ending and idc I'm not playing another second.     1. How can you slander him for his game 4 performance when 2 days prior he had 45 points on 22 shots? Hell he had 3 less rebounds then Dwight Howard that game. Harden definitely stunk it up in game 5, but no Rocket player outside of Harden scored more then 20 at any point in that series so it was pretty much guaranteed to happen. Especially considering the Warriors built a super team on their coaching staff that year.    The following series Lebron went 13-33 with 6 turnovers in the series clinching game 6, but he gets a pass because the warriors had a better roster?    2.  &gt; Most of his tenure in Rockets, he had the team completely designed to his strengths as a ball handler with a coach that made him the center of the offense unlike any other player in the history of the league thus far.     And thats what elevates him so much in my eyes. Every trip up the floor you know its a Harden isolation coming, but you cant do anything to stop it. Hes literally a playshot in 2K only in real life against the greatest players on the planet.     He scored 30 in 32 straight games (28 in the game that broke the streak after coming back from an injury against an Atlanta team that seemed determinedto end the streak) with this playstyle. The story of MJ telling guys what he was going to do them before hand is basically what Harden did during this streak and it didn't matter. They went 21-11 during that run with him playing like this.   3. If high level versatility doesn't make you great what does? Thats like saying the Model S isn't a great car when it has a higher top speed, acceleration, horsepower and features then just about every other car out there.   He has one of the most complete offensive games ever, the only thing missing is a post up game, but thats redundant with his current play style.    I'm not disagreeing with you about playoff success, but im also not blinding screaming ""Ringz Chuck "" like I'm Shaq. Everyone you mentioned had at least 2 team mates better then James Hardens best team mate ( 2018 CP3?) This is the first year since he's become a starter, that his team is truly a contender and its not a case of the team going as far as he drags them kicking and screaming. Over the next 3 or 4 years we'll get to see who Harden really is the post season when he's not able to he double and triple teamed every trip down the floor."
I didn't realize that was an argument. I think Booker is a scorer that doesn't bring much else to the table. Not sure if that's entirely fair. DRose was explosive but probably shouldn't have won an MVP. LeBron or Dwight Howard should have
Young Dwight Howard vibes
"that fucks me up. i remember Dwight Howard hung up on me during a phone call after he posted in Webcam chat to put your # and he'd call. so long story short i did, he called, and hung up on me. so it's pretty safe to say I remember his prime. these people are way too young"
"He‚Äôs guaranteed to get in. The only people that say shit like that weren‚Äôt around to see his dominance during the peak of his career or simply weren‚Äôt paying attention.  The memeing of Dwight Howard the person has taken a massive hit on his perceived legacy in recent years. Nephews on /r/NBA don‚Äôt have a clue, plain and simple."
And Dwight doesn't?  Are you kidding me? Dwight Howard would look like Clint Cappela on steroids while go head to head with Gobert for DPOY.   I'm not saying Embiid is not the better choice but prime Dwight would give him a run for his money.
Shades of Kobe baptizing young Dwight Howard
everyone wants to deny the fact shaq straightup bulllied dwight howard for years.. even thru the whole anti bullying movement. all bc we dont like dho and love shaq and thought it was funny
What the...We talking about the same dude that dunked on prime Dwight Howard?
"Dwight Howard, Javale McGee"
I'd go  Dame/Jaylen Brown/Mikal Bridges/Bam Adebayo/Myles Turner  Bench: Gary Trent/OG/George Hill/Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard wasn‚Äôt good. Chris Paul was for 1 year and your team was shitting it‚Äôs pants until he got hurt.
Shaq is a diva. Just ask Dwight Howard.
"Now let's add context since you're just looking at statlines.   Give a team 2 weeks of doing nothing except game planning against him because they weren't worried about *checks notes* Jeremy Lin stepping up, and you're gonna see things like this happen.    Or no torn up shoulder, completely checked out Dwight Howard was gonna magically become Hakeem to take defensive attention off him? Nah it was gonna be future Hall of fame Eric Gordon that was help remove focus on Harden."
Lol *just* Dwight Howard and Chris Paul
"Lol just stop talking, you clewarly have no idea what you're talking about ... you think LeBron was going 1 on 1 with Hedo Turkoglu all game? The Orlando Magic were the best defensive team in the league that year and had fucking prime Dwight Howard locking up the paint.   I guarantee you the 2007 run would have been special regardless of how old I was. Just stop"
"He played in a league with 8 teams and small white dudes. He wouldn‚Äôt have any of his records if he played In today‚Äôs league. He was a physical specimen amongst Jerry West lmfao. Today, he wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere close to the biggest or most athletic guy. Westbrook would‚Äôve torched the dudes playing in that era. Wilt would be Dwight Howard now at best"
"Yeah, exactly. In other words, it's reasonable that a 50% shooter (e.g, Dwight Howard) or an 84% shooter (e.g, Donovan Mitchell) could start off 17/25. On the other hand, the odds of Dwight Howard (or even Donovan Mitchell) starting off 95/105 is so incredibly small that we know Harden's FT% must be above that.   As Joe Harris takes more free throws this range will narrow, but it wouldn't be surprising for him have a FT% of 80% at the end of the season.  Note: We're making the (solid) assumption that a player has a ""true"" free throw percentage that doesn't change throughout the season. In that case, each shot gets us closer to revealing what that FT% is. The only case this assumption should fail is a significant midseason injury."
Dwight howard played in orlando? Vince Carter? Tracy Mcgrady?
"I'd argue offensively even without him taking 3s. Few centers had his full skillset in the early 2010s. He was taking shots with 2 steps in front of the 3, no issues.   Dwight Howard still reigned supreme in that era though for sure."
"Dwight Howard is the one guy I‚Äôll give you that was for sure better in the early 2010‚Äôs, but beyond that Brook was right up there"
"Prime Shaq. On defense he‚Äôd be put into a lotta screen action and targeted, but there‚Äôs ways to help for that. Plus he wasn‚Äôt a statue, he could definitely still move his feet in his prime. At worst with Shaq on defense is you‚Äôre giving up open-look 3s and the occasional lob. However, literally not a single person in the NBA right now can guard prime Shaq. Once Shaq gets the ball in the post with position it‚Äôs an automatic dunk. Say teams double him, then they‚Äôre giving up an open 3 look... with today‚Äôs 3 point shooting. I think a Prime Shaq with a modern 3 ball team built around today would be like the 2009 Dwight Howard Magic on steroids."
"As a player? hes a 35 year old center on the vet min, so not particularly good. Him being joels best backup isnt a super high bar to clear. As a teammate tho? Hes been a great locker room presence, which is weird to say about dwight howard of all people"
I'd love to see him in sets similar to Dwight Howard in Orlando too
"I'm just playing bro I'm a lestan though. I'm 24 and I've been watching LeBron since I had the high school phenom DVD with him, stoudemire, Dwight Howard, Sebastian telfair. LeBron is the closest thing to a superhero a person could be in my eyes."
Have the Bucks every played Giannis at center in a 4 out 1 in type of set a la the Dwight Howard Magic? I feel like he could be decent in that play style
"True, but if you want to talk about competition against everyone else we can always expand it to DPOY's. Gobert's won 2 DPOY's so far and been top 3 an extra 2 times in his career.      Here is the age of some other players when they won their 2nd DPOY, Gobert won his 2nd at age 26.        - Mark Eaton, 32.  - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31.     - Dikembe Mutombo, 30.   - Alonzo Mourning, 29.   - Dennis Rodman, 29.  - Ben Wallace, 28.   - Dwight Howard, 24(!)"
"**Players leading all-star votes multiple times**  Michael Jordan - **9** times  LeBron James - **8** times  Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter and Julius Erving - **4** times  Magic Johnson, Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, Grant Hill, George Gervin - **2** times"
"Yeah, honestly I see him as being *at least* on the level of prime triple DPOY-Dwight Howard in how he reads the floor and positions himself.   I think (obviously am biased here) that Howard's peak was definitely higher, but that's partly a product of Howard's athletic peak being soooo much higher than Gobert's and his ability to quickly cover ground/guard the perimeter that much better."
"Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, Kawhi, LeBron, Gobert, Dwight Howard, Giannis, Marc Gasol, CP3, Tony Allen, and I could keep going.  That's just players he's played against. When you start bringing in previous era defensive greats, Draymond isn't even top 30."
Prime Dwight Howard was a far better pick and roll defender and could be the number one scoring option. What a stupid take
"That sounds like dwight howard. Their even the same height. Y'all should trade for JJ and Gundy, bring Nelson out of retirement and try to make the magic of 09 happen again."
"This is gonna be a really interesting season to watch Dame. I‚Äôve never seen Dame as an MVP candidate but so far this season he‚Äôs playing well enough to maybe get nominated. Him and Steph are both making a hell of a case.  Before you start replying to the MVP thing, hear me out. Kawhi was only ever nominated once. Melo never won. Dwight Howard as a back to back to back DPOY never won. Patrick Ewing never won. All time greats of the sport don‚Äôt always win MVP. Dame is an all time great. That doesn‚Äôt make him an MVP. But this season he‚Äôs got a case so far."

Yeah I know all about the tuskeegee experiments. They‚Äôre awful and disgusting but it‚Äôs also no excuse to deny science. People like MPJ and Dwight Howard are fucking imbeciles
Did you guys know that ~~Dwight Howard~~ Zion Williamson and ~~Josh Smith~~ Ja Morant played on the same AAU team???
Nah a lot of them are just dummies . I know Dwight Howard is antivax and I‚Äôm sure there are more
Im going to go Dwight Howard. He‚Äôs a lock for Hall of Fame but it feels like he‚Äôs already been forgotten about and he‚Äôs still playing.
"Pretty sure it‚Äôs the other way around for KD. A lot of centres are listed at 7‚Äô but in reality are 6‚Äô10-11‚Äù, like Cousins, Dwight Howard or DeAndre Jordan however KD is not one of these cases- he‚Äôs listed as shorter than 7‚Äô but in reality he plays over 7‚Äô because he‚Äôs like 6‚Äô11.5‚Äù without shoes"
It's Dwight Howard though. Jokes at his expense are always approved on this sub. Remember when he had to go through the fake gay rumors and everyone just had to contribute their best homophobic jokes?
MPJ and Dwight Howard confirmed top players
"Even enforcing a no-trade gets backlash, like with Dwight Howard in Orlando and Melo on the Knicks. Melo even took a discount to stay with NYK but Phil tried to force him out after."
Caruso looking like LeBron and Dwight Howard in their primes on defense protecting that rim.  Holy.
"I see no reason, barring injury, the Sixers can't run it back next year as well. Embiid will be 27, Simmons 25. The only major expiring contracts are Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard. Surprisingly, legitimately everyone else is signed until the 2022-23 season."
Dwight Howard is the better player
"idk about Dwight, he averaged 13 PPG for the last five years of the decade.  I wouldn't say he was under-rated, though it's true that a lot of newer fans don't know about how good he was in his prime years since this is the only Dwight Howard they've seen"
"I never liked Dwight Howard.    I never liked Carmelo Anthony.   I already respected Chris Paul.     I wasn't too familiar with John Wall, but he seems dedicated."
Dwight Howard was always good. People just loved to hate on him and he was overpaid.
He is about to be so much better than r/nba expects   His job just got easier and he no longer is in detroit.   Dwight Howard D rose comeback is seeable
Who are you speaking about? Our fanbase loves Dwight Howard
"Remember four comments ago when you were arguing stats from 35-40 feet shouldn't be used to evaluate a shot from 37 feet because it's the wrong ""grouping"" and that it was the equivalent of comparing 12+ feet stats to 3s. Good times.      Now you are comparing Dwight Howard, a notoriously bad shooter, and his proclivity to not be able to translate practice to the game, to a top 5 shooter in NBA history and arguably the most clutch player in NBA history. Hardly the same.      ""I didn't want to put it into the referee hands,"" Lillard said.

"Not even insanely athletic. I‚Äôm not envisioning Peak Dwight Howard athleticism. I‚Äôm talking about above average to borderline elite. Say the level of athleticism around the top 15 most athletic centers in today‚Äòa league.   I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you that Jokic is a better playmaker than any big man before him. Perhaps I should have focused on it more in my post, but I feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äòeasier‚Äô to improve one‚Äôs skillset than ever before. Because of precise training, having film just on your phone or on tablets on the sidelines during games, etc. So Jokic has taken his natural gift of passing and by getting in a shit ton of reps and film room study taken it to an otherworldly level. A prospect coming in now with a natural passing gift would also have the opportunity now more than ever to push it to its absolute limit.   I‚Äôm really making a point about how you can really max out your talent and skillset now more efficiently than ever before"
Y‚Äôall do the same shit to Dwight Howard rn too
David Robinson is underrated when it comes to talking about best centers in NBA. He‚Äôs like a taller and more skilled version of Dwight Howard if that makes sense.
"Dwight Howard during his physical peak, D Rose during his prime, thats just off the top"
None of this will happen and An  2021 allstar(cp3) gonna sign min for a ring next year sounds dumb as hell Dwight Howard is 35 years old he prolly gonna retire he already got ring Oladipo will not come to nets for coming off  the bench and Dinwiddie will leave for highest payer he is already 27 years old with injury history Damn these are delusional af
"And he's asking for you to give a specific instance, with the Thunder organization, of another player who acted like Reggie did during the whole debacle.  Don't bring out a strawman argument, while referencing Russ ""leading the league in techs"" (11) like that's some metric for his attitude  as a player. In the top 5 spots there's also Draymond Green (9), Dwight Howard (8), Devin Booker (8), and John Wall (7), but none of those players (aside from maybe Draymond) would be considered ""petty"" or argumentative.  Russ has a hot head with certain rivalries (Wall and Dame in particular), but nowhere near as bad as you are portraying it to be."
"Rosters full of long time veterans win the championship every year  last year was lebron, rondo and dwight howard  before that marc gasol, ibaka, kawhi  teams full of kids rarely win anything"
"Nah its simple. As long as they call it both ways, they can manipulate the outcome by deciding which type of basketball game will be played. Take the Dwight Howard Magic for example. They had a dominant and physical center in Howard and shot the lights out on the perimeter, when the refs decided to call it very loose down low, there was almost no chance the slasher-heavy Cavs were winning the East"
"2020 Lakers. Lebron, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo"
"It was and always has been an objectively bad shot - Paul George was completely justified to call it a bad shot.  Dame crossed half court with 13 seconds on the clock with a timeout remaining for Portland. Dame then chooses to run an iso play and dribble the ball for 12 seconds without any advance closer to the 3 point arc. Keep in mind, the game was tied at 115-115. Every coach in the world would tell Dame to run the clock down, drive to the hoop for a layup and try to force a shooting foul.  Instead, Lillard launches the 3 from just about the end of the logo, while a 6 foot 8 Paul George contests the shot, nearly blocking it.  Bad coaching, bad play calling, bad decision making, bad shot.   If you‚Äôre STILL not convinced. Dame is 2-23 all time shooting from the 40-50ft range or 8.7%. Dwight Howard‚Äôs career 3 point shooting is 9-68 or 13.2%  Dwight Howard, at the 3 point arc, is statistically a better shot than Dame at 40ft."
"Only because he thinks he's Hakeem, if he plays the Dwight Howard role he would be scary"
"Also because of the Dwight Howard experiment last season ,I think drummond will assert himself more into a lesser role and get minutes that way than stat padding with a bad team."
Ask Dwight Howard
Young player who can contribute right now on the level of Matisse Thybulle/Terrance Mann/Donte DiVincenzo  Veteran with experience but can still be a very quality rotational player (Dwight Howard/Derrick Rose/PJ Tucker)  AT LEAST 2 1ST ROUND PICKS  1-2 2nds  Salary Fillers
"Of course not, case in point Dwight Howard last year. But it certainly does limit their ceiling in terms of player standings. For example there can never be a ""goat"" player for the nba that didn't earn rings as the main guy. So a no ring Giannis in 8 years will not crack too highly in most people's all time list."
Lol. There are only two players the Lakers couldn't win the title without last year and neither of them were Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard was a buyout guy technically but it‚Äôs somewhat different since it was before the season and only 5mil
"That's what will happen, similar to Dwight Howard last year.  LeBron won't tolerate any shots from him besides lobs and putbacks."
‚ÄúComplete nothing‚Äù I swear half of y‚Äôall are just talking out your ass and don‚Äôt know the man is still a functional rotation player. If Rivers had the chance to replace Dwight Howard and Mike Scott‚Äôs minutes with Aldridge he would‚Äôve been jumping up and down.
"Drummond can be good, he's not shown ability to actually do that on a consistent basis.  If you can Dwight Howard him and get him to stop the stupid stuff then you'll have a rebounding machine with good hands that can help your defense.  Unfortunately, I think the stupid stuff kind of fuels him, and you hope the turnovers and jump shots with attempts to be point guard just don't hurt too much.  He should be a positive contract at the minimum, we couldn't even get a 2nd rounder for him ( the Knicks could have probably had him for that) - so I just don't think he's going to contribute much.  I'd say maybe a couple regular season games, he has a decent game and makes the difference, and hey that might be all they need."
"Honestly.. if he can somehow mentally commit to doing nothing but rebounding, defense, and dunking, he will be extremely valuable to LA. Like a much better version of last year‚Äôs Dwight Howard.   As we‚Äôve seen time and again though, players used to putting up 14 shots a game have a tough time adapting to way less usage."
"Huh? We're comparing Dwight to Dwight and LMA to LMA. Again, literally the same player with or without a ring. Dwight in his current state is more highly regarded because he helped LA win a ring vs if literally the exact same Dwight Howard played for a mediocre team. That's all that dude is saying. Nobody is talking about prime Dwight or Kobe vs Horry or Embiid vs Cook"
"Dwight Howard was DPOY 3 times in a row, and took his team to the finals.. regardless of anything else.  How dare you compare Superman, to a guy best known for shooting 2s at an above average rate?  I'm sorry man but Dwight was the best player in his league and even Conference for several years, rings don't and wouldn't change that.  Premise seems flawed to me."
"If they can convince him to be a better Dwight Howard (rebound, alley-oops and stay in front of your man) he's going to be a guy putting up 20/10 on 13 shots on any given night.  I think he's about twice as good as current Dwight Howard so he should be able to do it way more consistently. I think his BBIQ is probably low, so the less thinking he does and the more energy he gives, the more invincible the Lakers will be. LeBron will figure out how best to use him."
He‚Äôs an upgraded Dwight Howard. This lakers team is gonna be good at full health
Andre Drummond makes you a superteam?üòÇü§£  The guy was traded for 2nd round picks last year. This year they couldn't even find a team to trade for him.  He won't even be on the court in crunch time because he can't shoot and can't hit ft's. This is basically bringing back Dwight Howard for the Lakers. They still a 2 star team.
2020 Champion Dwight Howard has entered the chat.
People literally look at Dwight Howard differently now vs 5 years ago
"I would call Dwight Howard a ""bad complainer"" tho.   Everyone gets mad about the double standards for someone like Draymond but Dray is smart about it. I've seen Howard get T'd up on good calls where clearly made a foul. Or call the ref a name which is literally the most pointless way to hurt your team. Everyone loses their cool sometimes and I understand that we are emotional creatures - but he complains a lot and probably doesn't make very smart arguments. I like Dwight a lot but that's what I've gathered after watching him for years and seeing stuff like this the whole time and catching random hot mic / lip reading."
Larry Hughes also had the shot IQ of Dwight Howard with a head injury.
What about the 2020 Finals' last bucket being a Lakers Dwight Howard 3 pointer?

"How are you this delusional lmao   &gt;Lebron joined a gutted team that didn't make the playoffs the year before on the heat.   This is just flat out incorrect. The Heat won 47 games and made the playoffs. Then Lebron joined. Then *another* player joined who averaged 24/10 the previous season.   &gt;then he joined one of the crappiest teams in the nba, the cavs.  No. He joined a 2x all star at 21 years old and a guy who averaged 26/13 the previous season and made two all NBA teams.   &gt;when you say ""durant is just doing it better"" and then saying lebron ""did the exact same thing,"" you are contradicting yourself.  If you really cant pick up on context clues, I will explain it to you. I meant Lebron **tried** to do the same thing as KD, but KD is doing it better. KD is adding old washed up vets to his team, just like Lebron did(Ray Allen, Dwight Howard, Rondo, Deron Williams, Rashard Lewis). Again, Lebron tried to do the same thing, but KD is doing it better.  Amazing that you say I'm contradicting myself when you are praising Kyrie as ""the best ball handler of his generation and perenial mvp candidate"".  You do realize Lebron played with and won a ring with that same guy?  You're a joke"
"&gt;How many superstars are gonna stick it out in fucking Charlotte? Or Cleveland. Now how many LA Superstars have left LA (before their careers were virtually over)?  O'Neal left Los Angeles -- not by choice, but had he not, Bryant would've, so that's one either way.  Chris Paul went to and from LA.  Dwight Howard went to and from LA.  Not that many superstars actually change teams before age 30.  Leonard did it twice.  James did it once.  Chris Paul did it once.  Durant did it once.  Davis did it once -- if he's in that class.  Carmelo Anthony did it once.  Dwight Howard did it twice.  O'Neal did it once.  That's about it, going back 20 years, and most of those were trades, and some quite expensive.  Maybe not in Charlotte, but Westbrook, Lilliard, Curry, Thompson, Antetokounmpo, Gobert, Simmons, Embiid, Beal, and others appear to be ""sticking it out"" in non-LA/NY markets.  Gasol stuck it out in Memphis.    &gt; Guys like Horford and Redick are sought after, but they aren't the marquee players that are like ""LA or bust.   No, they aren't, but Erving and Malone were.  Erving even left his hometown for Philly -- the Knicks made an offer, but the 76ers outbid them.  &gt;Any city outside those 3 needs to pray for a generational talent to fall in their laps and try to build up a roster around them.   You don't need a ""generational talent"" to win a ring, and you sure as hell don't need one to be competitive.  Miami doesn't have a generational talent, and went to G6.  Toronto didn't have a generational talent, and won a ring.  San Antonio did not have a generational talent in 2014, and won a ring.    &gt;You're not getting a generational talent if your team can consistently get the 7 or 8 seed.   You have to pick one here.  Either you use ""generational talent"" properly and it refers to LeBron James only, or you mean something else, in which case you have to include players like Antetokounmpo.  And he was precisely available to such a team -- Milwaukee went 38-44 and got swept by the Heat in the first round, and subsequently drafted their 2-time MVP.  Denver went 36-46, then drafted their franchise Serbian."
"Trez got a T bro. Howard and Trez got double T'd, then Dwight kept leaning up on him and getting in space, and got a 2nd T."
"Rockets ride or die but I also follow players that used to be here or that if I just like their playstyle, like Harden, RoCo, CP3, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Westbrook, KD, Dwight Howard, and Jaylen Brown off the top of my head"

Dwight Howard is 35 going on 20. A1158 from [day 1158](https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20many%20games%20has%20dwight%20howard%20played).
"i do not think that Dwight and Rondo were part of the Lakers being ""ridiculously stacked"". I don't even think that team was super-stacked  But also I doubt it. Howard and Rondo were both highly effective in small roles, I doubt that LMA and Blake will be that similar"
There's only been two 30-30 games in the last 30 or so years - Kevin Love and Dwight Howard.   Moses Brown isn't doing it.
LeBron wasn‚Äôt the first to team up with other stars tho. What about Moses Malone to the 76ers. Wilt to the Lakers. Charles Barkley/Scottie Pippen to Houston. Karl Malone/ GP to Lakers. Steve Nash/Dwight Howard to Lakers. Ring chasing has always been a thing.
"It's because guys like this are the difference. Think Shaun Livingtston, David West, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo and the roles they played on chapmionship teams. No one is asking Blake to be Lob City Blake anymore, they're asking him to put up efficient minutes against teams' second rotation. And LMA can be dangerously efficient as well, especially playing alongside a facilitator like Harden"
Is Dwight Howard the exception that proves the rule?
I think for the min he has value. If you can get him to just rebound. Set picks. Be big. He‚Äôd be good. It‚Äôs kind of the Dwight howard syndrome before getting to the lakers.   Except Dwight is significantly better as a defender. Same glaring offensive low iq moves.
Everyone was saying the same thing about the Lakers signing Dwight Howard last season and we all saw how the went. I feel pretty confident that they can get Drummond to buy into his role on the team
"Have the Lakers really gotten ""everyone"" in a while? I feel like we're talking Nash and Howard, then the dying years of Kobe, and then KD. Everyone laughed at Dwight 2.0, Danny Green and Rondo up until they won a title dominantly.   The Warriors got ""everyone"" during their run, and here we are with Brooklyn now.   LA hasn't deserves their reputation for a long, long while."
Dwight Howard *
"Mozgov was traded to the Nets, who then traded him to the Hornets for Dwight Howard."
And what's sad is that he isn't even the best version of that mold. 11-13 Tyson Chandler is. Dwight Howard doesn't count; he posted up like he was TD but had post moves like if TD took a bullet to the head.
"Frees up roster spaces, sometimes can help save money on the salary cap.  Example: Grizz traded CJ Miles (8.7) for Dwight Howard (5.6 mill). Saved 3.1 mill. They then negotiated a buyout of D12 saving $2.6 mill which he got from the Lakers when they picked him up. Dwight got all 5.6. Grizz saved 2.6 from his deal, 5.7 overall from when they began with CJ (an example of why *not* to buy out CJ), and Lakers got a guy but who cares about them ;-)  If you dont negotiate a lower buyout amount, its being done for the roster space."
literally its the lakers with rondo and dwight howard last season... washed former all stars
dwight howard and rondo to the lakers vibes. former big names to ride the bench to a ring
"Wasn‚Äôt Dwight Howard a former MVP?  I guess that locks it up for the Sixers, right?  Or guys who get bought out generally aren‚Äôt good enough to be factors in the playoffs."
"Though some seasons can be debated because of insufficient playing time, Moses Malone and Charles Barkley did it 15 times and Wilt Chamberlain and Dwight Howard did it 14 times. Duncan (13), Bill Russell (12), Wes Unseld (12), Abdul-Jabbar (12), and Olajuwon (12) got close. Garnett (9) and Big O (7) didn't get close. I'm sure I missed a few, too."
When did Dwight Howard retire?
"If you do well and win in LA, that will raise your stock more than averaging 20 points on a team that's currently under 0.500 in the East.  Guys like Kuz, THT, and Caruso got paid or will get paid because they contributed to a championship team.  People will see Caruso started in game 6 of the Finals and blew out the Heat, they'll know he was a great glue guy and hustles and makes smart plays.  The narrative around Drummond right now is that he's an overpaid and overplayed big with tendencies to be lazy and a ball stopper.  He may get his stats in Boston, but that narrative isn't going away and will hurt him when it comes time for his next contract.  But if he plays within the Lakers system and sacrifices and makes big contributions when needed, then suddenly he's an excellent rebounder, a team player, someone you can depend on and build around.  Dwight Howard was seen as the as the same kind of over-the-hill big who was just an empty stats guy.  He came to the Lakers and it completely changed how people perceived him.  Now he's got teams vying for him.  Same with Rondo, people saw him as a certain type of player that the league has passed by, but now he's got championship contenders who want him.  Drummond already got paid this season, so he's not looking to score a big contract this year.  He wants to demonstrate that he's worth a big contract next year, and that won't happen on a team that may be bounced in the first round."
"i agree with your nets take but the lakers are not too far ahead of the rest of the west for me considering their injuries, the loss of dwight howard, and the strength of the western conference"
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are the newest ones:  Dwight Howard: [https://basketballbeacon.com/dwight-howard-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/dwight-howard-player-profile-stats/)  Jae Crowder: [https://basketballbeacon.com/jae-crowder-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/jae-crowder-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks!"
"Agreed that he should be the clear favorite.  That said, there needs to be some nuance to it as availability is not most important, otherwise the Sixers MVP would be Danny Green or Dwight Howard. There needs to be some balance to playing games and how you play in games."
I was thinking Tim Duncan with Dwight Howard. Timmy D's fundamentals and maturity with prime Dwights crazy athleticism. The combo would be a wall defensively
"Chris Paul and Dwight Howard. CP3's skills and IQ with Dwight's size, interior defense and rebounding"
"Sixers have a great bench. George Hill, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Matisse Thybulle, Dwight Howard, Mike Scott."
This is hilariously stupid.   Zaza started on a hawks team that smoked Dwight Howard in the playoffs.   Zaza was a true brute nba role player.  A rich man's Chris dudley.  Is this a compliment? Not really.  But he had a limited skillset which allowed him to play on good teams and not hamper them.
If we are going technical then dwight howard has been ejected from the game
"""they need Dwight Howard""    1000 iq team building from Chuck"
Then we got Dwight Howard and he stunk up the place.
Chris Paul dunked on Dwight Howard in his prime and stupid quick and strong - so I think if you took on his athleticism AND skill scouts would definitely notice
On that conspicuously wide-shouldered Dwight Howard tip. Dude looks like a cartoon mob boss with the wide shoulders and relatively skinny waist.
"&gt; Rockets lost because they have players who are average shooters shooting 10 threes a game. That‚Äôs bad basketball  They shot 36% as a team, while taking some 500+ more attempts than 2nd most prolific 3pt-shooting team (the Nets).   Rockets had the best offense in the 17/18 regular season and the only person jacking up 10 or more 3s a game was James Harden. Of their most prolific 3pt shooters, all of them shot between 36% to 38% which is about league average to above average.  Their main problem was Harden (10 3PA, 29%) &amp; Ariza (5.4 3PA, 28%) going ice-cold in the playoffs, failing to make shots they've been making all season. Yet they still took that ridiculous Warriors team to 7-games  &gt;Emoni bates or Luka can get any coach in the nba except pop fired they are generational talents coaching does not matter in basketball Rudy tomjonavich won twice  You tell me coaching doesn't matter, then give 2 examples that directly contradict your point.   The Spurs do not win the 2014 title without Popovich, that team in any other coach's hands would have gotten ran off the court by the younger &amp; more athletic Heat Big 3  Tomjanovich was a highly-rated coach, Hakeem gets a lot of credit for the Rockets' 2 titles in 1994 &amp; 1995 but Tomjanovich helped craft an offense that allowed Hakeem to shine.   It was a very modern offense, with shooters like Smith/Maxwell/Cassell/Horry etc spacing the floor to give Hakeem more space in the post. It was somewhat similar to how the 2009 Magic flanked Dwight Howard with 3-point shooters, daring opponents to double the big-man who can then kick out to open shooters."
Malcolm Brogdon is a year older than Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and the same age as Bismack Biyombo  Taj Gibson is older than Dwight Howard
psh... a nick young/dwight howard/kwame brown combo is the only answer.
He dicked dwight howard so much. Ive never seen an all-time great defensive big get dicked down so hard.
Dwight Howard after the age of 25 was already a first ballot HOF imo.
Did it on Dwight Howard too
"For that series, dwight was seriously under rated. Dwight carried houston. It was Aldridge vs Howard but people only remember .9 and assume it was harden vs dame which it wasn't really."
"I‚Äôm a big believer that most rumored trades are that .. just rumors. False stuff getting leaked to make teams either look more desperate or to make it look like a team tried when they didn‚Äôt really. At the end of the day I try to tell myself if a rumored trade that didn‚Äôt go through has me thinking, ‚Äúwhy wouldn‚Äôt they accept that?‚Äù I tend to tell myself it probably was never on the table. That being said some that come to mind -  - Kyrie to the Wolves for Andrew Wiggins. This was right after the Wolves got Jimmy. I actually think Kyrie and Jimmy would of been a really good back court, especially with KAT as a pick and roll big with a great low post presence. I don‚Äôt think the Wolves were ready to give up on Wiggs yet at the time though.  - Jimmy for 4 first round picks to the Wolves. I feel like this one wasn‚Äôt all that it was cracked up to be. They only leaked that the Wolves turned down 4 first rounders but not the potential protections the Rockets might of put on them. That being said Jimmy with that specific Rockets team might of been enough to get them past the Warriors.  - Lakers trading Dwight Howard to the Clippers for Blake Griffen and DeAndre Jordan. This one was really wild for me. I remember thinking there was no possible way this was on the table because it seemed like the Lakers were fleecing the Clippers but I remember watching them tear apart the Lakers on First Take for not accepting the offer the minute it was sent TO THEM and talking as if there were already legit talks between the teams about the trade. That being said idk how reliable Skip and Stephen A are when they report on stuff so I still think it might of not been true. Would of been wild though."
I feel with ayton and Dwight Howard we'll be unstoppable
And completely without Dwight Howard tonight. Just not a solid strategy at all.
"Healthy? We were missing the one and only ejection expert, the illegal screen invincible, Dwight Howard."
Excuse me we are missing future HoFer Dwight Howard
"One of the reasons Ben Simmons has been weak in the playoffs is spacing.  You guys didn‚Äôt have a real offense and lacked spacing.  JJ Redick running around the perimeter was a life line.  But this year you have some actual shooters and Tobi has stepped up his percentage again.  If they can‚Äôt pack the key against Simmons and Embiid without giving up good looks to people like Tobi and Seth Curry, they will have to give him a little more leeway.  I don‚Äôt think Drummond would abuse them like that in a playoff game just because they‚Äôd pack the key and force him to get rid of the ball or take bad shots, but Embiid is not Drummond and they don‚Äôt have an answer.  Their entire backcourt might foul out trying to slow him down like prime Dwight Howard."
"He probably would've been first team in 2013-2014 if voters didn't prefer to put 1 point guard and 1 shooting guard; especially at that time. It's gotten a lot more positionless since then.  2014 guard spots were a toss up between CP3 Harden and Curry; Curry was significantly ahead of all the other 2nd team players in voting  &gt;First team  &gt;F: Kevin Durant (625 points, 125 first-team votes)  &gt;F: LeBron James (623, 124)  &gt;C: Joakim Noah (551, 101)  &gt;G: Chris Paul (540, 86)  &gt;G: James Harden (502, 73)  &gt;Second team  &gt;G: Stephen Curry (489, 65)  &gt;G: Tony Parker (210, 14)  &gt;F: Blake Griffin (350, 5)  &gt;F: Kevin Love (237, 2)  &gt;C: Dwight Howard (226, 9)  He was only 13 points behind Harden for 1st team all-nba, and had 65 first team votes to harden's 73; while being 279 points above the other 2nd team guard Parker"
"These are some skill moves. But they are all set up by that undeniable combination of tremendous size and very good athleticism. It was all that foot speed that he had along with being 300+ pounds that made him very special. The hops and wingspan helped a ton as well. But mainly it was size and foot speed. No one has ever been that big, that tall, and that fast at the same time. Wilt, David Robinson, and Dwight Howard come to mind as having similar height, speed and hops. But they weren't moving the bulk. It was the combo of all three that was special. The skills, nah, nearly every PF and smaller player in the league has all those skills. Most of the Centers have the same level of skills as well, just many are so slow they never use the skills. But they have all have the skills to do a fadeaway jumper or dribble the ball. They can all do that stuff. Well most of them can. I'm old enough to remember Chris Dudley. I'm not sure he had any basketball skills."
Jimmy was also smacked in the head by Dwight Howard at the game 5. There‚Äôs a decent chance he was playing with a concussion in game 6 and everyone was pretending that everything was okay to avoid him going into the protocols and not being able to play in game 6.
"This is pretty much it. Besides maybe Dwight Howard? Lebron is the most physically gifted player of his generation and it seemed like he used that to his advantage more than having some unstoppable will to win. MJ and Kobe were more vocal leaders earlier in their career as well. Lebron chose to go to D-Wades Heat. He wasn‚Äôt the Alpha that we know him as now really until he got his ass really beat as the favorite. It was then he took it personally. All that to say this... Lebron is now in the same discussion, it just took him longer to get there."
"He was always a premier rim protector but playing in a league of Ben Wallace, Dwight Howard ,Kevin Garnett etc made it difficult to award him... plus the spurs dynasty was always defensively sound"
Hey I like the winning but the Dwight Howard post ups weren't exciting unless he nusclrd his way through for a dunk.  We were kinda boring and paint by numbers at times.  Throw it to Dwight wait for a double team kick it to a shooter and rince and repeat.  If they didn't double Dwight would throw up an awkward hook shot.  Maybe we ran pick and roll but that's about it.
"PG - Chris Paul (my pass-first point god, JKidd-like) - era 2000s  SG - Kobe Bryant (i'd go with Kob, rather than Mj the goat) - era 90s  SF - Kawhi Leonard (good matchup with Bron) \*my next go-to-guy behind Kobe - era 2010s  PF - Tim Duncan (can use his bankshot to stretch the floor) - era 90s  C - Dwight Howard (prime monster at Rebounds &amp; Blocks) - era 2000s  6th Man - Klay Thompson (off ball, perimeter defender) - era 2010s  &amp;#x200B;  Coach: Larry Brown (DET &amp; PHI tenure)  System: Defense-oriented, Free-flowing offense  underrated at all cost,"
"Lakers got Dwight Howard, Sixers got Andrew Bynum, Magic got Aaron Afflalo, Denver got 1 yr of Andre Iguodala. All team lost in d trade."
Prime Dwight Howard with his hops &amp; size [could only do this basic ass dunk on a 12ft rim](https://youtu.be/MeJnBytUYZI?t=145)  You're insane if you think there will be people dunking on 13ft rims
"That hoop is almost certainly not 12 feet. Here is a video showing some of the best professional dunkers, and even they cannot dunk on a 12 foot hoop. https://youtu.be/gTvdVmYAlPM  13 feet is the same height as the top of the backboard. Dwight Howard allegedly has the highest recorded max reach of 12' 6"", which is half a foot short of 13 feet. https://youtu.be/sVfCaPRgTA4"
"Weirdly I might take Dwight Howard.  Prime Dwight + Prime Embiid might be better then Davis + Gasol.  Dwight was so fast in his prime could easy keep pace with small ball lineups.  Gasol, would still be really good, but grit and grind was always methodical in how they ground you down.  I'm not sure the faster pace would suit him as much."
"Interesting that you see this as 'showing passion.' I see it as unprofessional, compulsive bitching and bullying from a rich famous person towards someone making a fraction of the money they are, doing a job that is demonstrably impossible to do perfectly.  The best players are absolutely not 'constantly' ejected from games.    Lebron has 2 techs.  Curry has 0 I think.  The only players in the league with 16 techs are Luka and legendary asshole Dwight Howard."
Yeah man was great. Its funny to think though that the only reason Joker wasn't the best in that series was Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard probably placed a curse on them üòÇ
One of my all time faves are also the magic with  PG - Penny Hardaway SG - Tmac SF - Vince Carter or Aaron Gordon  PF - Dwight Howard C - Shaq
"I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I‚Äôm not even being politically correct, normally guys say I‚Äôm giving it to LeBron but honestly I‚Äôll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he‚Äôs on right now, he‚Äôs got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He‚Äôs playing, well, like he‚Äôs the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He‚Äôs the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"No onnis saying they‚Äôre unbeatable but when you compare this team to last year or even the year they took the raptors to seven games, needing 4 bounces to lose, this is probably the most complete they have ever looked.   They have a top tier coach in Doc Rivers, Joel is playing as the mvp, you got some of the best shooters around him and Ben with Seth and Danny 3 rings, Doc proved he‚Äôs the Tobias whisperer by reviving that man. Then you get to the sixers bench which is anchored by Dwight Howard proving LA made a mistake, Korkmaz blooming into the deep threat, George Hill providing leadership, then Matisse Thybulle being the best defender in the nba on less minutes.   Am i saying that they are a lock? No anything can happen in playoffs, but if the sixers can get the right seed, there‚Äôs no reason they cant make the ecf and beyond."
"Do you not remember prime Dwight Howard?    Seeing a guy as big him move so fast, but still be able to overpower whoever he faced downlow. And it felt like he was always going for highlight blocks trying to swat shots into the 3rd row."
I think the Lakers struggle have more to do with Lebron and Davis being injured than losing Dwight Howard and Javale Mcgee
"I think he‚Äôll be fine now that LeBron is back. Right now they‚Äôre still trying to figure out how he fits into the mix, but LeBron has a way of telling guys what their role is and getting them to fall in line. He‚Äôll be a better version of what Dwight Howard was last year"
I would love for the sixers to win it all for Dwight Howard to prove the Lakers wrong and Danny green and embid proving how dominant he really is. On top of that doc rivers proving he is an ELITE coach. Other than that the clippers for RONDO who the Lakers let walk very stupid decision in hindsight. And I don‚Äôt mind Kawhi as a player I think he deserves more respect. As far as the nets they are trying to buy a ring just like the üêç did in GS it‚Äôll mean nothing and then he‚Äôll get on Twitter and defend himself to me sitting in my basement
"I think last year they were winning because they were having fun, not the other way around. Not bringing back Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee was a gigantic mistake"
Dwight Howard and Danny Green were the real MVPs holding that team together.
"It‚Äôs bad when fans rather the Lakers play Gasol, or to have never let McGee or dwight howard leave. If you need Andre Drummond, you‚Äôre not in a good place."
Dwight Howard maybe
Maybe Dwight Howard
We gave up Dwight Howard for nothing and signed Harrell
I feel you man. I got this feeling in 2011   All under 25 players in 2011   Dwight howard   Cp3   Derrick rose   Kevin durant   Russell westbrook   Kevin love   Andrew Bynum   Rajon Rondo   Brandon Roy   Tyreke evans   Blake Griffin   These guys had me excited for the next decade    The future of the NBA is currently really bright.
Where did Dwight Howard come from
3rd in DPOY in the 08-09 season only behind Dwight Howard and Lebron James so he was pretty elite at it
How is the universal answer not Dwight Howard. You know what moment I'm talking about.
Hoping the league rescinds this after further review. Even Dwight Howard had an egregious tech recently rescinded.
"It's amazing that, in a league with Dwight Howard &amp; Kevin Durant, Paul George still finds a way to be the most mentally weak player on any given night."
"That's really the only thing that'll stop him.  With his play, I don't think father time will ever impact him like other young combo players.   He's basically New Jersey Nets Jason Kidd +Dwight Howard Rockets James Harden... At 22.   Look at how much better both Harden and Kidd got past 30... And the son of bitch is 22.  Just unreal.b"
"None of their bigs can even come close to stopping Jokic. They have to choose between doubling him and letting him create an open 3, or just watching him make zubac his bitch for the 200th time.   The lakers beat him last year by playing their ref advantage. The stripes gave Jokic 2 ticky tack fouls at the start of every game to slow him down. Then, the lakers would then send Dwight Howard out to hack at him every single play. Since the LA Lakers never commit fouls, the refs would ""miss"" at least one blatant call, and that would be enough to send the Joker off the deep end, hampering his efficiency even more."
"&gt; but the way AD is playing comming off injury, and not having Howard and McGee to guard Jokic, it's going to be not so easy job either.   AD looks like he's well on his way to being his usual self come playoff time. He's not looking labored or limited at all out there, he's just getting his timing and conditioning going, but he's got a few weeks to work on that still. And McGee hardly played in the Denver series last year. Dwight didn't play huge minutes either. The two players combined to play 139 of the 240 center minutes that were available in last year's 5 game WCF. The other 101 were played by AD (the exact same number of minutes Dwight played). This year instead of Dwight and Javale, the Lakers have three options to put on Jokic (in addition to AD), and all three are very different players.   I think that again a Lakers-Nuggets matchup would be a good one, but with Murray out and without Jerami Grant this time, I think the Lakers will win again. MPJ looked good offensively against the Lakers last year as well, but LeBron played him off the floor because he was so bad defensively (which is why Paul Milsap got more minutes than MPJ did). I'll be excited to see that series if that's what we get. Honestly if the Lakers are fully healthy then I expect them to beat anyone they're matched up with, but that's why they play the games."
Jokic with the reverse Dwight Howard
"&gt; Pretty much all of them.   Those are all big, strong, physical centers.  I feel I have to repeat myself here.  You're completely missing the point.  Davis does not like to play center against big, strong opponents.  It's not a talent issue.  He does not like to bang with physical centers.  &gt; AD already matched up Jokic last season and was fine.   It was Howard who matched up with Jokic in that series.  [https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2020/09/19/dwight-howard-is-taking-great-pride-in-bothering-nikola-jokic/](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2020/09/19/dwight-howard-is-taking-great-pride-in-bothering-nikola-jokic/)  [https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/21/dwight-howard-is-talking-a-lot-of-trash/](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/21/dwight-howard-is-talking-a-lot-of-trash/)  If you haven't any idea what you are talking about, which is the case, perhaps you should just stop.  &gt; Zubac is another guy that's almost useless with the ball in his hands.   This is completely irrelevant.  It's about fighting for position, and rebounding, and in a word, ""banging""."
"Do one-year rentals count? if so, then Karl Malone. Fuck that prick for hitting on Kobe's wife and ruining the team's chemistry. And I never wanted him to come in the first place--the Jazz were the enemy. (And back then I didn't know about him what y'all bring up every time he's mentioned.)  If one-years don't count, then Nick Young. Dude was a strutting clown.  Dwight Howard would've been up there, but he redeemed himself in his return. I'm pretty sure most Lakers fans feel this way.  Now, current players. Anthony Davis. Many reasons. I don't like the way he forced himself out of New Orleans. Bubble aside, on the Lakers he seems lazy. His moaning about playing C and his refusal to almost ever go strong to the hole make him seem like a cupcake. And what's sure to be an irritating, recurring refrain during his Lakers' tenure, I'm foreseeing him (and this isn't a stretch at all based on his history) missing significant time every season with recurring, nagging injuries."

Bam adebayo and dwight howard
"Dwight Howard would be an upgrade on all facets of the game, they probably regret not resigning him"
The Dwight Howard euro step from earlier this year rubbed off on him.
*Dwight Howard turns back the clock*
Trade Embiid build around Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard. That is all.
"hope a big man gets put on the market and almost trade for him, then probably sign Dwight Howard"
"If Booker turns into a megastar and they replace Paul with another star down the road, you can find a good defensive center for so much cheaper than a max though.  Like Lowe says it is near impossible to juggle 4 huge contracts unless you have an owner willing to go nuts in the tax.  Jarrett Allen, Mitch Robinson, clint Capella were late picks who contributed on cheap rookie deals. Nerlens Noel a d dwight howard are bouncing around the league on small deals. Nets replaced Allen with Claxton on another rookie deal.  If you have elite perimeter players, finding a big to just guard the rim and set picks is super cheap if you have the right system and scouting department in place.  Edit: I'm also not comparing Ayton as a complete player to those guys, just saying if you give Ayton a max he better be one of the best defenders in the league while being elite on offense or it isn't worth it, because you could get one or the other for 5 million"
I freaking love watching Dwight Howard play
"Better offensively but worse defensively Dwight Howard, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever put up the stats to win DPOY(much less 3 of them) is more or less what I mean"
Dwight Howard more like Might Foulhard
He was really good defensively in Portland when he played. I think he would've been in that Ben Wallace/Dwight Howard tier purely as a defensive big with multiple DPOYs. His offensive game wasn't dominant though
I would put Dwight Howard over Draymond but it‚Äôs surprising to see that there haven‚Äôt really been that many great centers within the past decade (as in the whole decade).
"""Sex is always a good idea"" Dwight Howard, father of 30."
Lol you're the only one revising history. The Lakers supporting cast was shit on all year last year from the moment they were put together. Nobody wanted Dwight Howard the Lakers signed him to a non-guaranteed contract after the Grizzlies waived him.  The revisionist history is what's happening now hyping them up the moment after they won the championship.
"2015 Tyreke Evans injured in first round, Mike Conley injured then returned and then injured Tony Allen in round 2, missed half season Dwight Howard in round 3, Kyrie and Love in finals is literally why the history will be skeptic to Curry through the years. His only KD-less success is one big asterisk not to mention subpar finals and his 2015 MVp is one of the worst statlines in mvp history"
"Exactly lol. Someone could literally be knocked the fuck out by according to this rule if the defender's hand apparently touches the ball. I understand that this isn't the case here and that it's a close call, but people are throwing this around like the gospel. Imagine you go for a dunk and Dwight Howard ends up punching a hole through your cranium but he ""touched the ball first"" and doesn't face any consequences."
The ol‚Äô Dwight Howard ‚Äúfuck it chuck it into the basket‚Äù special lmao. Nasty play regardless though.
"LeBron James (2003), Dwight Howard  (2004), Chris Paul (2005) used to start for my 2k7 lineup along with Kobe and Garnet. These old dudes are still relevant today. Damn."
"Even bad defenders make good plays sometimes. If Dwight Howard makes a 3, you don't go BUT I HEARD DWIGHT HOWARD CAN'T SHOOT?"
Reminds me of that dwight howard quote when he was on the Lakers
Dwight Howard played 14 minutes without getting called for a single foul.
"The Orlando Magic dropping 3's around a Dwight Howard post was a big change.  Before that the 7SOL Suns jacked up a lot.  Hell, the we believe Warriors were throwing em up whenever they could.  Yes, it was increasing.  But the rate at which it was increasing changed.  https://shottracker.com/articles/the-3-point-revolution  Ignore the mid 90's when the 3 point line was moved in for two seasons.  The point is the rate keeps increasing more stiffly because they haven't found a ceiling on this yet.  As players have focused more on distance shooting and offenses are working to create better 3 point shots, they're realizing that sharpshooting is the future and post ups are basically dead."
I wish he was Dwight Howard
He can jump he is just not Dwight Howard and his arms are short as well
"Everyone always questioned what he'd do when his athleticism started to waver but even as it has he's still one of the most physically gifted centers today.   Same goes for LeBron, who has lost a step and will continue to, but even as he nears 40 he'll still be in the upper echelon of athletes in the game. He also hasn't even started nearing a bench role yet which is crazy to think about. If he wanted to and accepted playing a Vince Carter/Dwight Howard role he could easily go beyond 40."

Philly with Shake Milton and Dwight Howard would go like 16-3 en route to a title in 2019
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, Dwight Howard. Sixers legends"
"Every star he asked for? He got a over the hump Dwight Howard, CP3 (with whom I still think he would have won the title if CP3 didnt get hurt) and Westbrook (when harden wasn't even the one pushing for WB - it was more Fertitta and his son forcing Morey to trade for WB).   This is nothing compared to other superstars like Curry having prime Klay, prime KD, prime Dray and Lebron having prime Kyrie, prime AD, prime-ish Wade and Bosh, etc.  You know its sad when Curry's 3rd best teammate was a reigning DPOY and Harden's 2nd best teammate was Covington"
"&gt;But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys.  ?? Yes it does, this whole conversation is about how you are worse after losing those guys. Other teams have been able to replace guys who leave easier.  I don't blame you for trading for Kemba - at least that was an attempt to replace Kyrie, but you didn't replace Hayward, Horford, Morris, or Rozier with good enough players.  Contenders are able to find value in the bargain bin every year, don't give me the whole ""woe is me"" bullshit as if you didn't have options available. Covington was traded for a mid-round first. Horford himself was dumped for nothing. You could have moved Hayward last year before he jet set on you. Dwight Howard is a backup C on a contender, Torrey Craig is a rotation player for a contender, You didn't want to move for Aaron Gordon last year when you had 3 1st round picks for up grabs. Jordan Clarkson went to the Jazz for nothing. George Hill, Delon Wright basically moved for nothing but you went for shitty ass Jeff Teague instead.  Please don't act like there was no alternative. Ainge made some wrong moves in trusting goes, drafted the wrong people, etc and these are the consequences."
"Like I said in the end, that‚Äôs nowhere near what the Warriors are doing with Wiseman. Capela was the 25th pick in the draft who had a 29-year old Dwight Howard averaging a double double as a solidified starting center ahead of him and the Rockets had other players like Montejunas who could at least fill in the center spot.   The Warriors started the season with 4 centers but went completely bankrupt in the center spot when Smailagic tore his meniscus and Marquese Chriss broke his leg in practice. The Warriors were already significantly capped out and Klay‚Äôs injury pretty much derailed any hope of possible contention so they really had no choice but to play Wiseman some significant minutes. The Warriors couldn‚Äôt afford to send Wiseman to the G-League because their center spot was so thin and they‚Äôre really only playing Green at center at times right now because that‚Äôs their only option."
"You act as if big z wasnt an all star before lebron and Eric Snow wasnt the starting pg for another team that went through the leastern conf into the finals.  Those guys were all decent players in the east.  Not a great team by any stretch but good enough with lebron in the east those days.  Take the best player off the over the hill pistons that already lost ben wallace, or take Gilbert arenas off the wizards etc.  Any team in the east those years were avg if you take away one of their best players.  Hell, the team he lost to in his prime the Orlando Magic without Dwight Howard was what?  Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis, and Turkgolu?  That's not much better than mo williams, big z, delonte west.  Look at any team those cavs beat - not a single one of them are world beaters.  The only really great team they played was the big 4 celtics that he infamously lost to and walked out on the cavs on.  Lebron simps are the worst."
I‚Äôd take Dray over 2015 Howard in a vacuum. Adding in play style Dray is a lot better with Curry skill set wise than Dwight is to Harden.
"Lol explain to me how it's stupidity ? Because I have an opinion ? Because it goes against you LeBron sexual. Lol half my reaaons for disliking LeBron are his fans. They're arguably some of the most toxic NBA fans hands down! The man shoots below 30% in all final 5 minutes of all finals game, he's 0/6 on finals game winning shots and he's never won without another superstar. He ain't shit without talent around him. Man couldn't even best dwight howard to get to the finals to play Kobe... Then made a super team and got put played by jason terry ü§£"
"Yep. After the Lakers self-combusted - they got bounced early in the playoffs then Phil Jackson left and they brought in Mike Brown and they went downhill pretty quickly - they decided to rebuild. They jettisoned Gasol and brought in Dwight Howard and Steve Nash to be coached by Mike D'Antoni. That didn't exactly work out, either.  But Pau did ok on the Bulls - he was an All Star the two years he was in Chicago. Then he went to the Spurs and quickly dropped off and was out of the League a few years later."
The only NBA players I know for a fact are Anti Vax are Dwight Howard and MPJ
"I‚Äôd disagree and I‚Äôm biased but context makes Rose‚Äôs mvp really impressive. Comparing MVP cases year to year is idiotic in the first place but I‚Äôm really sick and tired of people who never watched the NBA that year talk down what a player he was.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I‚Äôm not even being politically correct, normally guys say I‚Äôm giving it to LeBron but honestly I‚Äôll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he‚Äôs on right now, he‚Äôs got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He‚Äôs playing, well, like he‚Äôs the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He‚Äôs the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"Wow! This comment just took me STRAIGHT back to my high school days! I used to wear really tight fitting white T-Shirts starting my sophomore year to really accentuate my shoulders. I lived near Orlando so people would shout, ‚Äúis that you Dwight!?‚Äù Or ‚Äúthere goes Mr. Howard!‚Äù whenever I walked by. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô7 but I have incredibly good posture so people always thought I was taller than I actually was. I would workout my shoulders ALL THE TIME just to keep getting these compliments, I mean seriously, I remember being in the gym 2-3 times A WEEK just to not let the muscles atrophy. Damn it‚Äôs still good to know that Dwight is still in the league because I feel like him and I share this personal bond, haha!"
"Yes  edit: in fact this needs much more emphasis lol, Dwight Howard is an absolute lock for hall of fame"
Is Dwight Howard a Hall of Famer?
Imagine Beal guarding Harden and Westbrook lmfao. With JaVale and Dwight Howard as his backup.
"Dwight Howard: See, I never just did things just to do them. Come on, what am I gonna do? Just all of a sudden jump up and hit people in the middle of a game like it's something to do? Come on. I got a little more sense then that.  [pause]   Dwight Howard: Yeah, I remember hitting people in the middle of a game."
Trae Young  Dwyane Wade  Lebron James  Rudy Gay  Dwight Howard  Sixth man: Josh Hart
In reference to the comment section on this thread it‚Äôs glaringly obvious that a majority of the people commenting on this subreddit have absolutely no idea what the old NBA was like. I never once said I wish it were like that today and never even agreed with Dwight Howard. But holy shit it‚Äôs funny to see people‚Äôs reactions to his comments like he‚Äôs some kind of idiot - that‚Äôs how the game has been played and continues to be played all over the world. Only fairly recently (past 10-20 years) have the referees completely changed the dynamics of how physical you can be. MJ‚Äôs insane game winner would be considered a pushoff today for example. I think each incident of handchecking and ‚Äúillegal defense‚Äù can be graded on a scale of 1-10 on a variety of factors.
"Nah fam, they looked like little girls   https://atlantadailyworld.com/2014/06/07/dwight-howard-slammed-with-memes-for-allegedly-chasing-underage-girl/"
"I was jus telling my boy, I hope he gets a 3/50 or 4/70. But with the cap prob going up after next year, hell prob do a 1 or 2 (hopefully), and do a long term in '23. I know boogie isn't the same, but if he can even get back to 80% of what he was in New Orleans, he'd be alright. But considering the next couple years is gonna see a bunch of older big men leave the league, he could be in a good position to make a splash next off season. I don't know, im not Woj, or anything, i jus like boogie. I feel bad for these guys who get hurt and basically disappear. For all the shit people talk bout Dwight Howard, the mans worked the system right. I jus want boogie to get the chance to be healthy and impact the game the way he can."
"Yeah, but this would also be a Dwight Howard designed business scheme, so it naturally wouldn't be very well thought out."
"&gt;Sixers veteran Dwight Howard believes NBA officials are targeting him  &gt;""I like to hit people"""
"russell was dwight howard height and weight and wilt was slightly bigger than gobert. shaqs era was also the heaviest era on record. the ""tank"" comment is about playstyle btw not size. its just that size also isnt at the max now at all  its not about them being able to play tough. the rules for physicality for bigs are actually much looser now.   for example, in wilts day if you bumped a defenders chest who was holding his ground in the post and moved him back, that was a charge. you couldnt move him at all.  absolutely none of the banging as allowed and mid to late 90s to now is probably the loosest era for bigs hitting people. jokic routinely does things that would be offensive fouls for wilt, kareem etc.   the difference between the three eras, wilt/russell/kareem, shaq/duncan, jokic/kat/giannis, is the skill concentration and focus.  wilt/kareem era had by far the most post skill. im talking genius level stuff compared to now in how they essentially had to dominate space w/out moving anyone. and were the absolutely lynchpins bc 3s were nonexistant pretty much. the best guys were wizards.   shaq era was peak big man dominance bc you had the post skill lineage not diluted too much bc 3s were still gimmicky, but now you could absolutely smash someone. shaq was like wilt w less skill bc he grew up being able to hulk out, but still schooled in old school post play. duncan/kg were the last old school bigs in how they were taught after shaq retired, but figured out how to modify.  this era, 3s have been more important for a while, so despite the rules for bigs being open the skill emphasis isnt on old school post play but in pretty much being tall man with guard skills who can cover ground. its been going in this direction since the 3 ball was introduced and now we've hit a point where the skill focus has moved all the way over."

Dwight Howard.  Bam is soft af. He injured himself in the Finals trying to body Dwight
"Dude got knocked out cold by Dwight Howard and had Doc screaming at him to get up and play without calling a TO, I don't blame him if he isn't a fan of Doc lol. Play only stopped when he finally did get up and a ref saw him about to fall over and held him up himself.."
such a shame he never got to play with Dwight Howard. Imagine the ejections
Dwight Howard is definitely getting that Wendy‚Äôs money. He did this back in March too
Why do teams continue to think Dwight Howard is worth playing in the 2020s?  What is he bringing value wise other than just taking up space?

Dwight Howard. Still is my favorite player and the reason why I am an Orlando Magic fan.
"? When you watch Lebron's teams stack every buyout guy and role player on vet mins they can? He literally had rajon rondo and dwight howard on vet mins while playing with a prime AD. Those miami teams were always loaded with good veteran talent. Same with the cav's, he always had the right shooters and right players around him. You're stretching the truth by a country mile."
I feel the Euro guys tend to take this stuff harder in general. I can't imagine Orlando booing Vuc but if they did I don't think he'd take it well. At the same time its probably going to piss Dwight Howard off that we won't boo Vuc.
Dwight Howard would‚Äôve been sentenced to eternity in the Phantom Zone
"Sort of.   1. He's been injury-prone so far. The current toe injury isn't a concern long-term but he's had a hip injury for the past 2 seasons which has really limited him. We're hoping he's nearing the end of it but we definitely need insurance.  2. Similar to Myles Turner and Jarrett Allen, you want to pair him with a big who can help out against post threats because they generally play him off the floor.    This offseason, one of our big areas of improvement will be the frontcourt. Thompson and Kornet have looked decent in their roles but we either need to add another big or swap one of those two out for another.   I'd say we're like a Dwight Howard away from having our C problem solved. Alternatively, if we could get Baynes playing well again."
"Lmao the 2020 Lakers were filled with a ton of dumb players. Javale Mcgee, Dwight Howard, J.R Smith, Dion Waiter üòÇ"
Dwight ‚ÄúLong live the King‚Äù Howard
"But I don‚Äôt see why. In that case you‚Äôre playing Davis at center anyway, in that case you really want to have a wing out there, not another big who isn‚Äôt switchy. You can do some things to make up for his weaknesses but it has to be worth it on the offensive end. It really isn‚Äôt with Lauri.   Lakers have over invested in bigs this year. I‚Äôd rather have Dwight Howard on a minimum and use that MLE on a wing."
I have not seen MPJ make a 3 pointer yet. Why is he throwing up bricks when the MVP is on his team? Hes looking like a worse 3 point shooter than Shaq and Dwight howard rn
That's definitely it. Dwight Howard wasn't taking forever so he could dial in his sniper aim.
"I wanna see a guy like Embiid or Jokic with a super-shooting team, just for kicks. Not even for like an official game, just an exhibition match for the spectacle. Like, a line-up of Steph Curry/Joe Harris/Duncan Robinson/Joe Ingles/Embiid or Jokic. Steph isn't allowed to do Steph things, purely just a dominant post-up threat down low and the four best catch-and-shoot shooters* in the league surrounding him.  Like the Finals-run Dwight Howard Magic on steroids.  *I don't know who statistically the four best catch-and-shooters are this year, but I think that's a pretty solid guess at the actual top four, right?"
Dwight Howard welcomes him to the club
And now Dwight Howard has done a count when Giannis has been at the line a few times. I remember him getting to like 16 once.
Dwight Howard got one when I think he was on the Magic
Dwight Howard used to do this shit too back in his prime.  They called it once and everybody was shocked because people didn‚Äôt even know about the rule.
"Yeah Dwight Howard and the Philly coaches did this the whole game last time we played them, there were even a bunch of highlights here because he was so obvious and persistent about it.  You don‚Äôt need a week of prep to complain about FTs from a notoriously slow shooter and the Heat don‚Äôt have some special whining sauce that makes their complaining more convincing or impactful. No excuse not to call this earlier if they were going to call it at all."
"If you aren't literally in the gym working with Draymond on his game, you aren't qualified to critique his growth as a player.  It's possible that Draymond has spent all season working on his floater but just sucks at them. It's possible that he's prioritized other aspects of his game. Hell, Dwight Howard led the Lakers in practice FT% one of the years he was in LA. He still sucked at them during the game.  You can criticize players on the floor all you want. Draymond is a huge liability offensively. But I'm not going to come out like ""why can't he just practice shooting 3's so he can level up his 3pt shooting,"" because that would make me a fucking simpleton"
"Well, I‚Äôve now seen it called twice ever. Once against Dwight Howard, and again just now against Giannis."
Maybe Giannis don‚Äôt want to be a screener like Dwight Howard did under SVG.
Fair points but the 2000 team is severely hampered by Howard‚Äôs lack of an offense of game. The 90s team will double everyone else and switch leave Dwight Howard open. Additionally you still have an answer how the 2000s team will play defense against the 90s team.They will not be able to go to the pick and roll and if they double that means they are leaving Olajuwon Jordan or Pippen wide-open good luck.  There is too much defense on the 90‚Äôs team to just ignore.  I‚Äôm a old head so my opinion is probably biased
"I think it'd be unfair to say something like ""The 2015/16 Rockets were worse, Harden deserves so much more credit"", this Warriors team is horrendous. Can you imagine how much Warriors fans would kill to ""only"" have Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard or Eric Gordon as the second best player? This team straight up can't score without Steph.   (Also because I got into basketball that playoffs, I hard disagree for 2015, Dwight played 41, sure, but come playoffs he mashed the Mavericks, and _with Harden on the bench_, he was the center axis of that insane comeback against the Clippers. He was, to a certain, real extent, the 2nd star. Its his last real Dwight season. To compare the first Rockets era to this Warriors team is revisionist)"
"Only person I will say is LeBron. Having a secondary ball handler is the difference between LeBron, harden and jokic going further. Haven't we seen that a heliocentric offense will work on all levels other than the playoffs. LeBron during the 1st tenure Cavs and 2018, Giannis 2019-2020, Dwight Howard in 2009. Roster construction matters, spacing matters. Just use logic, if you have a 45% chance if hitting and Extremely quick 3 more accurately than your teammates hitting shots, you would take that chance every single time. I would literally prefer a double teamed curry hitting a shot from the logo over a draymond floater. How is that bad decision making? Turnovers are a result of carelessness definitely, but you're just kidding yourself if you think spacing didn't have anything to do with it."
"The worst part was the idea that Dwight Howard would be ""embracing new ideas"""
"What exact shit team was harden playing on? If I recall he had Dwight Howard one year, Chris Paul another, and don‚Äôt forget Russ."
"&gt;  but he also played his best years in a significantly harder league (defensively speaking)  His best year that you (maybe it was others I don't remember or care) cited was the year notorious for inflated scoring due to laxed rules. Mike James dropped 20ppg, and hilariously was more efficient shooting than Kobe's best year.  It's not just efficiency. On/off numbers too. But yea you can argue that the stats that show how good you are at scoring are not good enough.  &gt;He‚Äôd undoubtedly have been much more efficient in today‚Äôs era with today‚Äôs rules and today‚Äôs trends.  That's not a given at all. For example, LeBron James from 2008-2010 has the exact same True Shooting as 2019-2021.  &gt;I don‚Äôt have a problem with you saying Stephs peak is better, but all things considered, i think it‚Äôs completely unreasonable to say it‚Äôs not close.  Statistically it isn't. If you want to bring in defense which is simply not as important for a PG compared to a wing, that can make it closer. Similar to saying how Dwight Howard was a better defender than Kobe. Yes, but that's also because it's more important for big men to be better defenders.  Way better offense when offense is more important than defense? I'm extremely confident in that."

I think Dillon is better overall but I think Danny Green fits into his role better if that makes any sense. Dillon Brooks on the Sixers in Green's role though would be absolutely disgusting  plus imagine playing against Dwight Howard and DB in the same game lol

I wish the Spurs would‚Äôve kept him. I lost count of how many times I screamed at the tv when pop would put in Jeff fucking errors in over baynes. He finally started doing a ton better in his last season after cracking the rotation then we lost him. The man who made Dwight Howard quit the Lakers will always have a soft spot in my heart
I deadass thought this was a parody of the Dwight Howard recruitment video they made years back for a minute https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptT9Le6N9xI
"Even so, then do what the Lakers did against Jokic last year, when they started Dwight Howard or McGee.   Let Len just bang on Embiid for the first 6 minutes of the game, then never bring him back."
"Big free agent. This guy‚Äôs claiming we‚Äôve gotten all the superstars to come sign here, when we Cacquited Kobe, pau, Nash, and Dwight Howard by trade. Before Lebron, Shaq was our most recent Fa and he signed in like 97 with us"
Go watch the clippers playoff highlights from last year and that‚Äôll tell you exactly why he won‚Äôt see the floor much with the matchups he‚Äôll have in the playoffs. We‚Äôre not making the same mistake and letting him get abused because of matchups he can‚Äôt compete with due to his size/skill set. All of our centers will see time in the playoffs based on situational matchups just like Dwight Howard and McGee did last year.
He also said some pretty homophobic stuff when the Dwight Howard rumours came out. Said no locker room would tolerate having a gay player. How he never got repercussions for that is beyond me.
"&gt;Certainly advanced stats have never been kind to Kobe,   There's a lot more to advanced stats than a bunch of box-score composites. prime/peak Kobe was significantly better than what his box-score advanced stats show, and his +/- numbers seem to agree with that. He didn't lead the league in a single advanced stat over his prime, and yet had the best offensive +/- numbers in the ten year study (02-11) and his minute-adjusted +/- look better than anybody on the list outside of LeBron and Duncan. He was higher than Wade, Nash, CP3, Dirk, Duncan, etc.   https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/10-year-rapm   Offensive +/-: Kobe: +6.6   LBJ: +6.6   Wade: +6.2   Nash: 5.5   Paul: 5.2   Essentially/virtually tied for #3 overall and the guy ahead by .1 (Wade) isn't even remotely close in terms of minutes played (Kobe played 29783 min over this sample. Wade? 20540. A difference of nearly ten thousand!).   So he's #3 overall, and only KG and LeBron are ahead. He's ahead of Duncan, Dirk, CP3, Nash, etc.   He's #1 in ORAPM (tied with LBJ...except Bryant played more than 4200+ more minutes over this sample)   Again, here he's ahead of Dirk, Nash, Wade, CP3, Duncan, etc.   He has the third best two year Offensive APM (behind only Nash and LeBron, and he's .1 behind LBJ) Kobe: +6.0 http://www.backpicks.com   That 2002-2011 study does basically cover Bryant's prime and that's why it's the one to use BUT it doesn't even include his remarkable 2001 season.   Here's the RAPM from that season (playoffs and reg season included) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/11181n4avq5wefk/AABLySVPmcZXb0uiGPEk53fpa/2001.txt?dl=0   He's #2 among all stars/superstars behind only Duncan. He's #2 in minute-adjusted RAPM overall/among all players(williams (lol) played 1800+ less min and wasn't in Bryant's universe anyway, and Stockton played nearly 1000 less min)...he's ahead of freaking peak Shaq   Duncan: 5.52   Bryant: 4.39   Shaq: 4.37   His 2001 run WOWY score is among the very highest recorded. It ranks #13 on the list (out of 1591 recorded player seasons) at 5.9, and is ahead of any single season from Duncan, Bill Ruseell, KG, Jerry west, Oscar, Shaq, Hakeem, Drexler, Ewing, Bird, etc. That Lakers teams had a 14.2 SRS with Kobe IN, a SRS change of 10.8! from the games he missed.   Now let's look at what is widely regarded as his peak (2008)   In 08 Bryant was very widely regarded as the best player in the game despite the measly 24 PER and ""advanced stats"" that pale in comparison to LBJ/CP3, and yet he put up better offensive +/- than anybody in game outside of Nash (who played a ton less minutes) and in fact had the best minute-adjusted numbers in the entire league along with KG.   Nash: +7.26   Kobe: +6.29 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/teutg7zvxudqnlw/AACIF1UxAphVjODbTtO57\_mia/2008.txt?dl=0   Kobe (24 PER): +6.29   LBJ (30 PER): +5.07   CP3 (30 PER): +3.41 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/teutg7zvxudqnlw/AACIF1UxAphVjODbTtO57\_mia/2008.txt?dl=0   Offensive and Defensive Adjusted Plus/Minus : 2007-08 Bryant was#2 in Off Adj +/- Rating   Bryant #1 in Adj +/- Rating https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxs2bv40jBt6GD7txEUcnItyvax\_zUfbTbnx1YXsL4/pub http://www.countthebasket.com/blog/2008/06/03/offensive-and-defensive-adjusted-plus-minus/   SWAgR Wins (minute-adjusted RAPM, first available in 2008): #1 in 2008 http://www.gotbuckets.com/   Over on the PC Board a poster completed a study that measured how well a team did when their star missed games.   It's called WOWY (with and without you)   In other words, if you looked at all of the activity of players moving in and out lineups over the years, whose team changed the most based on a given player‚Äôs presence?   Kobe (prime) had one of the highest scores recorded at +6.5.   He's higher than Russell, Wilt, Chamverlain, Duncan, Shaq, Bird, KG, Dr J, Karl Malone, Barkley, Durant, and many other great players.   His prime WOWYR is among the highest ever recroded at +6.5, and he's at +4.9 for carreer. To put that into perspective, Shaq is at 6.7 for career, and 5.2 for career.   The answer? Regression, the same statistical method used on play-by-play data in the last few years to create irreplaceable impact metrics like RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus). Since comprehensive play-by-play does not exist before the late ‚Äô90‚Äôs, WOWYR instead regresses WOWY data, or game-by-game plus-minus data. (It‚Äôs better than WOWY, so it‚Äôs ‚Äúwowier,‚Äù and stands for ‚ÄúWith or Without You Regressed.‚Äù)   https://backpicks.com/2017/11/17/part-iv-historical-impact-multiple-wowyr-studies/   http://www.backpicks.com/2016/09/06/ii-historical-impact-introducing-wowyr/ http://www.backpicks.com/metrics/wowyr/ http://www.backpicks.com/2016/09/28/iii-historical-impact-wowyr-60-years-of-plus-minus/   Basically all the impact numbers tell us that peak/prime Bryant was having astronomical impact that went well beyond the box-score.   And what's particularly impressive about Bryant is that he made astronomical impact on great teams and next to some other stars. It's easy for a superstar to take a horrible team and get them to mediocrity, or turning a decent team into a good one, but making HUGE impact on amazing teams/ strong contenders is much more impressive, and so the fact that this his impact is at this level while playing with Shaq from 02-04 (on teams that weren't built/around him and while playing with another superstar whose biggest strength was also scoring, so certainly not the ideal situation to make maximum impact) and then anchoring the contending teams of 2008-2011 (the 08 were one of the strongest non-champion in history and GOAT level with Pau, and the 09 Lakers were one of the best teams in history and statistically one of the strongest champions ever, and obviously the 2010 Lakers were the champs) is extremely impressive   2000-2003 RAPM:   Tim Duncan: 6.653076648712158   Kevin Garnett: 5.877338886260986   Dirk Nowitzki: 5.492855072021484   Kobe Bryant: 5.319833278656006   Ray Allen: 4.893278121948242   Shaquille O'Neal: 4.781240940093994   Vlade Divac: 4.614269256591797   Eddie Jones: 4.310861587524414   David Robinson: 4.280535697937012   John Stockton: 4.192468166351318   Top-10 from 2000-2007 using this data (no priors other than the ridge penalty):   0 (Tim Duncan). 6.500221252441406   1 (Kevin Garnett). 5.95599889755249   2 (Dirk Nowitzki). 5.492483615875244   3 (Kobe Bryant). 5.328146934509277   4 (Manu Ginobili). 5.262575149536133   5 (Paul Pierce). 4.795802116394043   6 (Rasheed Wallace). 4.647972106933594 7 (Ray Allen). 4.319425582885742   8 (Shaquille O'Neal). 4.274540424346924   9 (Andrei Kirilenko). 4.141995906829834   Here's 2006-2010:   0 (LeBron James). 6.657414436340332   1 (Kobe Bryant). 6.563058853149414   2 (Vince Carter). 6.485203742980957   3 (Manu Ginobili). 6.1238603591918945   4 (Dwight Howard). 5.78971529006958   5 (Tim Duncan). 5.780171871185303   6 (Kevin Garnett). 5.3996477127075195   7 (Dwyane Wade). 5.073834419250488   8 (Steve Nash). 4.619450569152832   9 (Baron Davis). 4.204566478729248   2004-2009 APM:   Tim Duncan: 7.90   LeBron James: 7.27   Kobe Bryant: 6.95   Glenn Robinson: 6.84   Kevin Garnett: 6.68"
"it depends on impact, scheme, and use  for example, the bucks and jazz defensive schemes depend heavily on giannis and goberts unique skills and defensive playmaking the way offenses depend on superstar scorers. them and guys like prime dwight howard perform small miracles every night but it goes unnoticed  it wasnt the same for kawhi, he was a 1 v 1 stopper, but even he was at such a level when he was making teams play him like deion sanders that combined w his offense he could argue most impactful and best all around in a league full of scorers"
"Vogel is not like Bud, he will actually change things up if they're not working, but he is always gonna start with his normal lineup just to see what it looks like before simply abandoning it. Last year's series against Houston should tell you all you need to know. Game 1 he started Javale as usual and brought Dwight in for his typical 2nd quarter shift.  In the 3rd quarter he started Javale again, and again brought Dwight back for the 4th, and the Lakers lost by 15 points, the only game they would lose to Houston.   In Game 2, however, things changed. Javale again got the start in each half, playing 6 minutes in the 1st quarter, but only got 90 seconds in the 3rd, and Dwight Howard didn't play at all. In Game 3 Javale started, but after his first 6 minute shift he never played again for the rest of the series. Dwight also didn't play again in the series after Game 1 until Vogel put him in at the end of Game 5 with the Lakers up 30 because he was emptying the bench.   Expect Vogel to start the Suns series with his normal big rotation just to see what it looks like. Maybe Phoenix has trouble with the Lakers size and the Lakers can beat them that way. Vogel always knows he can go small if he needs to, but he won't go to that right away. When the chips are down he'll play his best hand, but he's not gonna show other teams his best pitch in their first at bat. But you better believe that if you're gonna beat the Lakers, you're gonna have to overcome their best lineup to do so. You won't be able to count on Vogel just playing the wrong guys. My suspicion after last night is that the Lakers best lineup is AD, LeBron, Matthews, KCP and Caruso. We'll see if anyone can beat that."
"This is overblown, especially come playoff time. Last year the Lakers played 21 playoff games, meaning there were a total of 1008 center minutes available for the Lakers in the playoffs (21x48=1008). Dwight Howard and Javale McGee combined to play 417 total minutes in the playoffs, which means the other 591 center minutes were played by someone else. Since AD was the only center on the roster, that means he played nearly 60% of the Lakers center minutes last playoffs. And since AD played a total of 769 minutes in the playoffs, that means over 75% of the minutes he played in the playoffs were at center.   I know people think that because the Lakers have Gasol, Drummond and Trez that it means AD won't play center, but it's not true. Vogel will put whatever lineup works best out there, regardless of who he has to bench in the process. Just look at how Gasol didn't play at all last night, how Trez didn't play in the second half, how Drummond was out for the last 15 minutes, and how Schroder got subbed out for Wes Matthews in crunch time."
Nah. I remember very well cause i was confused as well during last years final. Dwight Howard had a tech and flagrant and he didn‚Äôt get tossed. I assumed he was getting tossed but he didn‚Äôt.
*cough* Dwight Howard *cough*
Well that‚Äôs pretty much solely because of Dwight Howard and I can say as someone who‚Äôs watched every Sixers game this year that 100% of them are legit moving screens.
"Howard came of the bench cause McGee was obsessed with that starting spot. But minutes-wise, Dwight had starter minutes and McGee had bench minutes.      In the playoffs Dwight played key matchups and thats it, and McGee played even less."
"Howard and McGee could play dunkers spot as an actual, viable threat. When you don't have a reliable threat there, you lose SO MUCH pressure on penetration plays.      Andre has no verticality. The dude is made of stone. Dwight and McGee filled the dump-off role at the dunkers spot perfectly for the Lakers.      When your center has below average finishing and below average verticality, you end up getting worse looks on plays that don't directly involve him setting a screen.      Also Andre has got to have the worst defense of the 3."
"&gt;	You probably haven‚Äôt seen a single game since AD has gotten back because Drummond does not demand the ball on offense and you‚Äôd know that if you actually watched him play for us. I can only assume you last saw him when we played the Nets or something to have this stupid of a take. The only thing that can be remotely seen as him demanding the ball is that he often looks for his own shot after getting a rebound.  I have actually seen every laker game because I‚Äôm a huge LeBron fan. So you can cut all that ‚ÄúyOu dOnT eVeN wAtCh‚Äù teenage argument.   The fact that you think Javale and Dwight required the ball just as much or more than Drummond just shows you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Javale and Howard combined for like 9 shots a game in 2020. Drummond some requires 9 a game by him self. And you can visibly see him get upset when he doesn‚Äôt get touches on offense. Did you ever see that with javale or Dwight?   &gt;	Oh no, he‚Äôs doing the exact thing we signed him for, giving us 15-20 a game at the 5, the horror üò±üò±üò±.  So what are you crying about then? Lmfao. You‚Äôre all over the place. You‚Äôre the one that brought up ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if you people forget McGee barely played during last years playoffs for a reason.‚Äù Drummond will be treated very similar to that. Shit, just even last night:  https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1395378782995828740?s=20  It‚Äôs not hard man. It‚Äôs all about matchups for the lakers."
"Those two were long and serious lob threats, probably why Lebron lead in assist last season cause they have lob and 3 point threat options. Also you're comparing Drummond to a fucking 3 time DPOY Dwight Howard."
Remember when he boxed out Dwight fucking Howard in the playoffs? That's when Dwight was closer to his prime too.  Edit* it was an offensive rebound too!!!  https://youtu.be/SzszeBrAj5s
Dwight Howard too.
"Hopefully not anymore, not after that. Holy shit, Dwight Howard has better footwork than that."
Dwight Howard once shot like 50 fts no lie
"‚ÄúUnless everyone else knew more than me, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when we signed Dwight Howard.‚Äù  That was your crosstown rival, championship winning team, and he was a key role player during the playoffs, how can he say that?!"
Bring Dwight Howard back!!
"Remember when Laker haters were like ""the Lakers signed Dwight Howard and Rondo?! üòÇüòÇ"""
Has Ingles surpassed Dwight Howard as the corniest guy in the league?
"I've noticed people on this sub tend to upvote things that *look* like they're well thought about, even if it's not factually correct lol. Example: your pasta mocking the OC wizards fan has 130 upvotes.... And you were joking/it's incorrect. I think most people just think you're giving an analysis on how to beat your team.  I remember seeing an in-depth analysis on how Gobert will defend jokic last playoffs. But I was like.. Jokic slows down and spins off people. If anyone helps off their man, Jokic finds the open man. Goberts crazy reach and agility to get blocks doesn't work on jokic when he's on a different course of time. The player who I feel always plays jokic well? Dwight Howard. If you play really physical and foul jokic 9 times and they only call 5, he's frustrated and you're playing him better than 90% of centers."
Dwight Howard is on a one year contract in Philly this year.
"Everyone‚Äôs sleeping on the 2k8 Orlando Magic. Dribble up to top of key with Jameer, wait for Dwight Howard to run beside you down to post, pass when he‚Äôs at the FT line, dunk on 3 people, repeat"

dwight howard pick up was insanely smart since it deny other playoff teams a semi-okay body to throw at your Embiid
It's hard to call it vindication when many other years he would be the front runner for rookie of the year.  It's not like we're looking at an Emeka Okafor/Dwight Howard situation.
as much times as they mention that Josh Smith and Dwight howard played AAU together
"Dwight Howard deserved to be MVP in 2011. He completely carried that Magic squad and it was some of the most impressive big man play I‚Äôve ever seen.  Rose was great too, but Dwight deserved it more"
"Clint, Gasol, and Dwight Howard are the only people I‚Äôve seen guard Jokic well. Even then you can‚Äôt contain him, only hope to slow him down üí™"
"&gt;Also getting Dwight Howard as a back up big has been solid. Even though he had a rough stretch in the middle of the season, I'd argue he's been a good role model for the young players and a great personality to have around.   Not saying your wrong at all, but imagine someone posting this 2 seasons ago. Crazy how fast he was able to turn his public perception and career in general around with that lakers stint"
I think the community is (slowly) getting better about this.  Called someone out for a homophobic joke about Dwight Howard a couple of weeks ago and I actually got some upvotes.
Too Bad Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard existed
"I'll always dispute this when people say the Lakers were trying to be bad. At the end of each season when it was clear they weren't gonna make the playoffs, sure, *then* they were no longer trying to win games and were instead prioritizing looking at their young players. But the Lakers were bad because of a combination of sheer incompetence by Jim Buss (and maybe Mitch Kupchak, depending on how much input he had), and having an aging star in Kobe Bryant.   Post Achilles Kobe wasn't any good anymore, and kept getting hurt, but the Lakers were trying to be loyal to him so he was still one of the highest paid stars in the league, and he wasn't wanting to take a back seat, so no other stars wanted to go sign up to be his sidekick. On top of that, the Lakers had gone all in on the Dwight Howard. Steve Nash combo, and that backfired and really screwed the Lakers immediate future, when Nash had essentially a career-ending injury in his 2nd game with the Lakers and Dwight Howard left after one year.  So that was the backdrop for why the Lakers were doomed to be no more than simply mediocre. But what made them as bad as they were was this stupid insistence that every year they could land a star player just cause they were the Lakers. So every year they tried to pitch the stars to join them, and when they got turned down (LeBron, Melo, LaMarcus Aldridge, etc), they would refuse to sign any non-stars to long term contracts so they could keep their cap clear for the next summer. Rinse and repeat.   This finally came to a head when Kevin Durant wouldn't even give them a meeting in 2016 (when he met with like 5 other teams), and the Lakers panicked and blew all their cap space on Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov, signing both to fully guaranteed 4 year contracts for huge money. Mitch and Jim were both fired a few months later, and Rob Pelinka then spent the next two years trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole they were in."
They were good.  But not incredible.  Sheed was the real defensive MVP followed by Prince.  Ben Wallace basically roamed center field and back then was allowed to two hand shove guys from behind (everyone was) when they got it in the post.  Shaq actually dominated him.  I atched Dwight Howard make him look like a babyon New Years or new Years Eve maybe 2008.  Came away from that game wondering why he got minutes at all with the Bulls.
Picking up Dwight Howard for cheap was a big move too. Has had huge impact having a real center to backup Embiid.
Already considered good and added Danny Green and Seth Curry and Dwight Howard and found a way to effectively use Tobias Harris
"I wish he never got fired fellow sixers bro, Sixers were my secondary team post dwight Howard trade and I would‚Äôve loved to see Hinkie turn Philly into a potential dynasty"
"The shots that have completely vanished since the 90s are mostly still jump shots, they're just the inefficient ones.   Nobody spots up inside the 3-point line, nobody runs plays to generate baseline jumpers on the sides of the key, and unless you're Kawhi Leonard or DeMar DeRozan, you probably don't take long 2s off the dribble.   Post-ups are down overall, but they're far from dead. Joel Embiid was automatic facing up in the post for this entire season; teams just aren't (or shouldn't be) wasting touches on post possessions for guys like Drummond, or like when Dwight Howard was in Charlotte and Atlanta."

"Also getting Dwight Howard as a back up big has been solid. Even though he had a rough stretch in the middle of the season, I'd argue he's been a good role model for the young players and a great personality to have around.   Now the offensive rebounding might get him in trouble occasionally and the 15+ technicals are certainly something, but he honestly feels like the first quality backup we've had at 5. No more Greg Monroe on game 7..."
"What about prime CP3 vs prime Dwight Howard?  Disregarding longevity.  CP3 has obviously proven he can carry a team through the playoffs, but prime Dwight was really special too.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Rose and the Bulls that year he would of had an MVP."
Nobody said Dwight Howard yet?
Surprised no one has mentioned Dwight Howard
"Ok top 10 is just unarguable   - Bill Russell - Kawhi Leonard - Michael Jordan - Scottie Pippen - Dennis Rodman  - Hakeem Olajuwon  - Dwight Howard - Ben Wallace - Kevin Garnett - Tim Duncan  That‚Äôs not my top 10, but 10 defenders better than Draymond"
I cant believe how much I like Dwight Howard.
"Absolutely. Just like Defensive Rating. Gar Heard has the best career DRTG ever, 95.30. His career ended in 1981. The highest active player on the list is Dwight Howard (99.75, 36th). Rudy is the next active player (100.28, 44th)."
Dwight Howard is criminally underrated
Dwight Howard (if he leaves)
"&gt;Dwight Howard  In that Sixer win, he also led the team in rebounding."
dwight howard reminds me of jar jar binks
"[Westbrook is at 24.5%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*GE*50&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) for contested rebound percentage.  Unsure about success percentage but NBA has rebound chance percentage, which is [defined](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/11/5/5066050/dwight-howard-rebounding-stats-houston-rockets) as:  &gt;The number of times player was within the vicinity (3.5 ft) of a rebound. Measures the number of rebounds a player recovers compared to the number of rebounding chances available as well as whether or not the rebound was contested by an opponent or deferred to a teammate.  WB is tops in that at 71.8% as well as adjusted rebound chance percentage (which removes rebounds that were deferred to teammates)"
He looks like Carmelo + Dwight Howard
&gt;He also incorrectly states that he was the first and only ever #1 draft pick straight out of high school.  We'll he was the first so that part is true but yah LeBron and Dwight Howard were picked 2 and 3 years later after him
I thought dwight howard was on steroids
And being healthy and getting a Dwight Howard type player.
"I hear ya, it's like saying Dwight Howard isn't a 1st ballot HOF, just based on his defense alone."
Cuban should go back to opening cap space to recruit dwight howard imo
"Dwight Howard, Rondo and Danny Green were not only good fits on the court, but off the court chemistry. Schroder, Gasol, Harrell, Drummond were downgrades at every position. I think everyone agrees that LeBron is a top 10 player of all time, but the whining, bitching, posturing, flopping and being a shit teammate is what people dislike about his antics."
"Probably not. We have 3 or 4 guys on our bench who are better or equal to him in how they impact the game. (Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, George Hill). I might trade Korkmaz for him (though that‚Äôs close because I REALLY like Furkan) I would trade Shake Milton for him with no hesitation."
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
"There was a lot of post-up play back in those days. I feel like ever since Yao Ming went down after 2009 and essentially didn't do much after that and retired due to injuries, the league has become more and more perimeter oriented and teams stopped getting conventional big men to defend because there was no big man to defend like that. Dwight Howard was the last one remaining but he never had much post-up moves and then after he left/got traded by the Magic he was no longer that great.   Big men are now capable of dribbling the ball and bringing it from the backcourt, no way would that ever happen back in the 90s and 2000s lol."
"Some fairly straightforward moves to make.  Strongly suggest for Trez to opt out of his player option using the Klutch + Rich Paul family connection. Let Drummond, Marc Gasol, and Morris walk.  Resign THT and Caruso long term for hopefully under $15mil/YR combined. Resign Wes and Benny Mac to another veteran‚Äôs minimum.  Re-do the entire front court. Look to sign two defensive minded PF/C that can rebound, rim protect, and not ask for post touches. Nerlen‚Äôs Noel and Richaun Holmes both could be affordable and available. Dwight Howard coming back would be fine as well.  See what‚Äôs available on the trade market. If POR is down to blow it up and sell off CJ McCollum I would resign Schroder and package him in a S+T with Kuzma and a 2022 FRP to acquire CJ.  If no trade partners are available I‚Äôd let Schroder walk and see if I can coax Kyle Lowry to signing a 2+1 deal for $20-$25mil/yr.  That‚Äôs about as good as you can do honestly."
Are Josh Smith and Dwight Howard AAU teammates?
"Not much info besides Dwight Howard saying he looks good in practice, obviously that‚Äôs far from a legitimate report tho lol. I think without Embiid we can still win in 6-7, Trae is a beast but having Ben/Tisse/Green to throw at him the whole game is huge. Still obviously will be a tough series"
"Certainly not up to the standards set by past Laker greats like Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Steve Nash, and Dwight Howard."
Dwight Howard and Terrell Owens. Think about it.
Wildest part of watching Dwight Howard play is that I've seen him hit so many Free Throws. I was watching like game 5 of the Wizards v 76ers game and Dwight was constantly getting to the line AND INCREASING THE LEAD.  Also I love how much he play bully ball and is such a pain in the ass to opponents lol. Dude has developed a great role
CP3 was better as was Tim Duncan. You can only argue Dwight Howard as worse by 2013 than Melo as he was the final member on the all nba team
a glorified dwight howard
"Dwight ""Supa hot fire"" Howard"
Dr. Dwight Howard
"How's Pat's rebounding game, last time we played you guys I thought that's where Donte excelled, our guards (sans Harden who's always looking for a triple-double now) fall asleep on the glass.  I think Pat's solid, but dude will jump at a Dwight Howard pump fake, he's gonna block the occasional 3 while picking up the most unnecessary fouls behind the line."
Well if Dwight Howard says so
Medical expert Dwight Howard
"Dwight Howard fell off because Kobe is a selfish player. That's on them that it didn't work out, that's a killer roster."
"If you actually watched that season you‚Äôd see that Steve nash was hurt the whole time, and Dwight Howard had fallen off hard in terms of production. Pau gasol was still good. But everyone was hurt that year"
"That's fucking prime Dwight Howard, damn good pau Gasol, and one of the best pgs in the league at the time. Never knew Kobe fans did the ""devalue x all-star teammate to make my guy look better"" like bron fans."
Dwight Howard pau gasol and Steve nash   Surely you can‚Äôt be serious
Dwight Howard has been doing it recently too. He is too strong to shoot that close
"Damn that‚Äôs a really interesting concept, never thought of that. My mind immediately went to Dwight Howard taking two steps back before bricking the FT üòÇ"
It‚Äôs been hard for me as a long time lakers fan and self admitted Kobe fanboy it‚Äôs been a hard few years. I still have resentment for Dwight Howard and I hate watching LBJ complain to the refs and give half efforts. Bleh
"Better teams? When LeBron had the heatles Kobe had Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, and Steve Nash. Have you forgotten how good those 00-04 Lakers teams were?"
"That's exactly how markets work. No one was ever getting absolutely ridiculous hauls with 5 years of picks for stars players until the Anthony Davis trade set a new market. Andrew Bynum a first and a second were enough to land Dwight Howard.  Houston got Harden for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two firsts and two seconds. Kyrie went to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Ante Zizic and a first. The crazy pick heavy trades for PG, Westbrook and Harden only came after the AD trade set the market. It isn't a reach to think that teams may have been overvaluing and that the market may correct itself based on another trade."
"AD holds some blame for being soft/fragile. LeBron got tackled by Solomon Hill. Pelinka did miss a chance to sign Dwight Howard, but other than that he did a pretty good job this year."
"Dude... Jokic is better than Lebron. This isn't even recency bias, Jokic does so much more it's not even funny. Granted Lebron is hurt and getting older but if you're comparing how they affect the game I'm taking Joker all day. Plus in that series they wouldn't have Dwight Howard to come in and hard foul Jokic 6 times every game."
Did we forget about Dwight Howard and the Magic shitting on the Cavs
F that guy  Should have picked up D Rose that season that he hosed the Lakers.  Made the Lakers wait and they had to deal with scraps.  Dwight Howard and D Rose would have been way better than Shroder and Trez.
I know it's a little late for this but this is exactly why I hated that they let Dwight Howard go.
Credit to the Suns but some of the off-season moves by the Lakers were questionable.  Dwight Howard played great in last years playoffs against Jokic. That‚Äôs the same Center you‚Äôre going to be facing in the playoffs for the foreseeable future. Why did they let him walk? I would have rather watched Howard and Gasol split minutes at Center than whatever the hell you call Drummond‚Äôs performance.
I'm not sure Kobe would be able to play with Lebron.  You think Shaq and or Dwight Howard pissed him off?  Imagine Kobe playing 5 on 4 defense 7 or 8 possessions a game while this dude argued on the other end.  He would have straight lost his shit
why the hell did the lakers think it was a god idea for dwight howard and rondo to leave the fuck
"Should‚Äôve kept Green and Howard. That said, i love Dwight on the Sixers!"
Dwight Howard apparently
"If only we had Dwight Howard and Danny Green type dudes on the court, that could be a championship winning team actually."
I think you‚Äôre forgetting they had basketball GOD Dwight Howard on that team
Twitter version of Dwight Howard
"I don't subscribe to the narrative that bubble players are hobbled from a lack of rest. JaVale McGee, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo, and Danny Green, to name a few, are on teams that are still alive in the 2021 NBA playoffs."
Lakers fans think Dwight Howard is all they need to stop this lmaooo
"Honestly as good as the Suns played last 2 games, healthy AD wouldn't have made one bit of a difference. Suns are the just the superior team, period. Lakers won the chip last year based on suffocating defense, and losing Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Rondo for Schroder and Gasol was a huge mistake"
Of course it's about injuries. Dwight Howard and Rondo aren't winning this game.
"No we had rondo ,dany green ,dwight howard, this team is just trash"
Lakers miss Dwight Howard. He would be down to massage AD‚Äôs groin during his off time
"I‚Äôd bet that If Dwight Howard was on this team solely to fucking rebound, Portland might have won this shit."
"Portland needs another Dwight Howard, Javale, defensive big man type"
Wouldn't a faster Gobert with mega hops just be Dwight Howard?
"Dwight Howard. Not saying he should, but refs watch him like a Hawk"
"Yup! I hope Pete helps your game like it did mine! Additionally, all his Dwight Howard videos are GREAT."
Yeah they are...who's this generation's Dwight Howard in terms of the biggest thot target in the NBA?
Top 5 Ant-Vaxxers  LeBron  MPJ  Terence Davis  Dennis Schroder  Dwight Howard
Is Dwight Howard a Hall of famer after this?
Dwight Howard is not putting up 30/10 numbers every night so...
"Yeah, I definitely give a shit about a PF having more blocks and rebounds than a SG. What‚Äôs next, Dwight Howard is better than Steph?  And how many career All-NBA‚Äôs or points they have is meaningless because Kareem played 6 more seasons"
"Dwight Howard is a better comparison imo. Both freak athletes that were unstoppable in their prime, best at their position and led their teams on deep playoff runs early in their career but could never go all the way. Both had careers that didn't quite work out the way they wanted for one reason of another. Now they can't be the top dog on a championship team but can still offer enough coming off the bench that makes a positive impact on the team."
&gt; dwight howard (god i miss u so much bb pls come home)  I love the redemption story
"2004 Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala, Trevor Ariza still here."
"he doesnt fit next to bron at all, but i was excited that he could be the bench leader we needed :\  i really dont get our roster construction this season man. harrell is only playable against like half the league it seems like, drummond feels like a lazier, clumsier and more egotistical dwight howard (god i miss u so much bb pls come home), gasol is ancient and i am convinced would crumble to dust if hes on the court for more than 20 mins -- im not sure what we were trying to do.  of course the above is all exacerbated by lebron finally starting to break down and AD getting hurt. if those two were healthy i feel like we could have swept the suns."
Dwight howard is a free agent. I can imagine he'll be a pretty popular choice for a backup C
"Brook Lopez, serge Ibaka Montrezl Harrell Dwight Howard all guys with under 15 mil contracts"
"If Embiid stays healthy for the series, Atlanta will have a hell of a time trying to get the screens to work for Trae. Embiid is such a versatile defender, switches onto Young won't burn him. And he is someone Capela has to stay active on, Capela was basically a blocking and rebounding pylon during the Knicks series.   Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel is a far cry from Dwight Howard and Joel Embiid. Atlanta need a HUGE boost from secondary point production to pull ahead in the series. Philly will not run out of good guards to throw against Young. I wanna say that Collins and Hunter will have to step up offensively, maybe get Bogdan some good looks from 3 and hopefully Lou will pulls out 6MOTY caliber performances in this series."
"It made tons of basketball sense for Kawhi and PG to team up in LA and we're seeing how that worked out. It also made basketball sense for Dwight Howard to team up with Kobe, for Jimmy to go to the 76ers and team up with Embiid and Simmons, for CP3 to team up with Harden, etc etc  Basketball sense doesn't actually make sense a lot of the time. Whatever Beal wants to do is the right move for him."
"Why would our team need someone who shoots high volume 3s yet is terrible at it? That would do nothing for us whatsoever, we would be a far worse team if we replaced Danny Green with Butler this series based on raw performance. Now it's true that Harris had the easier job of course, but in the regular season Harris shot 39.4% from three, an excellent mark, while Butler shot 24.5% from three, which is worse than Dwight Howard this season. Raw shooting numbers matter, especially when dealing with the Ben Simmons problem"
"‚ÄúBail out card‚Äù ...? Fans/media will say a lot of dumb shit that will have no impact on next years team. They could win each game 100-0 and skip will find a fault.  The more important thing to find out is what can they do to improve this roster? Dennis Schroeder seems to be a better regular season player, while rondo filled a role that was better in the post season. Tho rondo had a healthier team that shot better in the bubble. And Dennis wants a 4 year for 100 mil  Dwight Howard barely played in the later rounds, but wasn‚Äôt perceived to be an empty stat player like Andre Drummond. I don‚Äôt see them resigning him Marc gasol is shot. He makes the offense better but is a chair on defense. Maybe could be a vet for a team, but likely retires imo.  Trez was unplayable last post season and the same continues. A lot of players are picked on in playoffs, and big man seem to fit this category a lot. Bryn Forbes (guard) will likely be dnp/benched against the nets (using this as an example)  Matthews is just a guy at this point. Great defender at Portland, not special since the injury. Decent role player and didn‚Äôt need a lot to sign him.  So the question is, who can they get? Maybe sign and trade with Dennis? That would be best case scenario with him. There was talk that Beal didn‚Äôt want to move teams because of COVID 19. Beal seemed to be disappointed with the lack of awards he got while in Washington, that he would likely get in LA regardless of winning. Tho you think lebron/Beal/AD would be a title contender if healthy.   There‚Äôs rumors that Leonard would go to the heat, but that‚Äôs coming from the heat. And no one really gets quotes out of Leonard. But that would take clippers out as being a contender (tho they are down 3-2 in first round), and again make lakers better. Heat getting swept might change his mind if the rumors were true.   Paul George is another option if Leonard does go to the heat. He‚Äôs signed for multiple years, and owner might want to blow it up if this doesn‚Äôt work out. They would have to rebuild like the nets did tho, and they haven‚Äôt finished the building where the clippers will play at either. (Pretty sure on that at least?)  Is there another player they can get that will help lebron but also replace him?  Because that should/needs to be the goal."
"Also, little known fact, but Josh Smith and Dwight Howard were AAU teammates."
"&gt; Westbrook also needs to hit the pavement to recruit veterans like George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Trevor Ariza, Javale Magee, Dwight Howard and other vet minimum players.  Why would most of these guys leave the teams they are currently on, especially those getting playing time, to be on a bad team?   In what world would Serge Ibaka for example, rather play with Westbrok and a Beal that barely squeak into the playoffs as opposed to PG and Kawhi that , while still potentially leaving in the first round, are a far better team?  &gt; I just want the Wizards to learn from Presti and just cut everyone shorter than Westbrook with shorter wingspan.   One of Presti's biggest downfalls is that he did a dogshit job of building around Westbrook's weaknesses.  It took Morey literally 3 months to figure out that you can't have a guy like Andre Roberson share the floor with a non-shooter like Russ, but here we are talking about how there can't be anybody shorter than Russ on the floor, which doesn't make any sense.  There's a lot of room between ""hey don't play 4 guards"" and ""hey don't play anyone shorter than Westbrook.""    Westbrook needs a very specific type of big to really space out the floor and frankly there aren't many of those in the league.  He needs (ideally) a guy that can play the traditional style of big *and* a guy that can go out on the perimeter and spread the floor for Russ to drive to the rim.  There aren't a ton of guys like that and they are usually fairly expensive."
"&gt;Westbrook also needs to hit the pavement to recruit veterans like George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Trevor Ariza, Javale Magee, Dwight Howard and other vet minimum players.    I thought i had a stroke for a second.  How on earth does that help ANYTHING."
"He had enough not to get swept by the Spurs, upset by a Dwight Howard led team, and embarrassed by the Celtics en route to quitting on his team.   OKC only became favored after Miami limped through the post season. Going into the season, as well as the playoffs, they were favorites. Vegas odds, not mine."
Not me when I see another George Hill and Dwight Howard pick and roll resulting in a contested mid range for Hill lmao
Lakers shoulda kept Dwight Howard
"DWade: ""The Cube is harder than winning the gold medal""  Well... Yea. You played with LeBron, Kobe, CP3, and Dwight Howard...."
"""Everyone getting some of that Dwight Howard wood""- Alaa Abdelnaby"
dwight howard is the lamest mf on the planet
Imagine seeing the lead extend due to Dwight Howard making FTs. What a time we live in
"He needs to at least learn how to shoot from the free. He‚Äôs a playmaker, and if he gets taken out because people will a hack-a-simmons him, that‚Äôs a key part of their offensive schemes gone. If Dwight Howard could learn to shoot, at least to a better degree, Ben can as well."
Excuse me but Dwight Howard really isnt that bad
We‚Äôre going to see a vintage Dwight Howard game today.    You heard it here first.
Dwight Howard is not a ‚Äúbad Center‚Äù
"Yeah i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a magic bullet, but I wonder if those viral photos of Dwight Howard giving him the stare down will just encourage other idiots to follow. Hard to know how their minds work - the threat of being banned from an arena and losing season tickets for life is pretty serious, on top of potentially being arrested."
Team built around Dwight Howard now
Yeah but who would cover Dwight Howard
"On paper maybe, but none of the moves panned out. They are missing Dwight Howard and rondo LOT."
Those bums on that Dwight Howard team would make the most clutch shots. Look at the series vs Cavs. Lebron would drop 40-10-10 and still lose because hedo or rashard Lewis would nail a dagger
"Y‚Äôall had Shaq, Penny and Dwight Howard chill"
He should have pulled a van stan gundy and publicly fued with his star like with Dwight Howard
"I mean getting someone like Lowry in Free Agency, a Jae Crowder-type of guy (or even just a healthy Trevor Ariza), and a big like Marc Gasol or Dwight Howard has not and will not be impossible to get."
Dwight Howard and Rondo leaving were honestly major blows to the team compared to last year...
"By that logic you can technically say Dwight Howard carried bums to the finals. I agree with you by the way.  I too get tired of LeBron fans calling everyone on those early cavs teams trash excluding LeBron. Also it's funny how they never bring up the teams they had to go through to make it to the finals that year. The wizards who they played didn't have a winning record and were without Arenas.  The Nets also didn't have a winning record and the cavs faced them in the second round. I think they had an injury on their team too, but I'm too lazy to look it up.  The Pistons didn't have Ben Wallace and won 54 games. I'm not saying this to poopoo on the cavs making it to the finals that year, but if that team played in the west chances are they don't make it out of the first round that year. I seriously believe the Utah Jazz with Williams and Boozer could have made it to the finals if they were in the east that year.   The next two years, those Cavs teams were ledgit and were favorites over Magic and Celtics."
Dwight Howard is a better and athletic defender than gasol and Drummond.
[Dwight](https://www.nba.com/sixers/news/team-signs-howard) signed a day before [Trez](https://www.nba.com/lakers/releases/lakers-sign-montrezl-harrell-free-agency2021) tho
Move over Dwight Howard there's a new set of shoulders in town.
"Last season, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo were key contributors but they left and were replaced by worse role players."
"They should have kept Dwight, rondo and Green. Lakers fans were acting like Schroeder, Gasol and Wes Matthews were somehow gonna be better then Green, Howard, and Rondo."
Dwight Howard
Agreed. They really miss Dwight Howard and Rondo.
Dwight Howard or Kawhi Leonard.
Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes and Dwight Howard are all unrestricted free agents this summer. I'd happily take any of them over Drummond."
Let me introduce you to Dwight Howard
"&gt;I don't know why you would try to ruin a good thing   I think if the Lakers had time to have a normal off-season they probably would have just run it back. But considering they only had 6 weeks off it's not difficult to see why the Lakers could have been wary about bringing back Dwight Howard (35 years old), Rajon Rondo (35 years old), Danny Green (34 years old), and Javale McGee (33 years old).   Bringing back the league's oldest team with such a short turnaround probably would have gone poorly also. After all, it's not like any of those guys are having a great playoffs for their other teams this year. The players who are playing best in these playoffs this year are the ones who were gone before the second round in the bubble, if they played there at all."
I think that title belongs to Dwight Howard at the moment
"Because they just want to shit on the Lakers' off-season moves. Rondo got a DNP-CD last night, Danny Green has been struggling, Javale has barely played (after barely playing for the Lakers in the playoffs last year), and Dwight Howard is averaging 9 mpg so far against Atlanta.   Those guys were all quality contributors for the Lakers last year, but the reality is they're all older vets who were coming off of a 6 week off-season after winning the title in October. It's really not hard to see why the Lakers might have thought that simply bringing back the league's oldest team under those circumstances could have gone poorly.   The Lakers instead went for younger, more well-rested players, and got screwed because LeBron and AD both got hurt anyway. It was a shitty situation the Lakers (and Heat, and Celtics and Nuggets) were all put in, but it was what it was. The Lakers tried a different approach to a unique situation, but it ended up not mattering because their two 1st Team All NBA stars from last year both got hurt. Way it goes."
Yep. Dwight Howard was never close to the same player after he got back surgery in that last year with the Magic.
"&gt;Hoping he‚Äôs able to recover soon. Back surgery, especially later in his career, is no joke.  Yep. Back surgery even early in your career is no joke. MPJ got back surgery in July of 2018 and missed the entire next season, so you have to wonder if Ibaka will suit up at all next year. And even when he does come back, will he look at all like who he once was? Dwight Howard was never the same player after he had back surgery in his last year with the Magic. MPJ has obviously recovered well, even if it took nearly 2 years to do so, but he's much younger than Ibaka is. Ibaka will now almost surely pick up his $10 million option next year, but he could hit free agency in 2022 before we ever see him play again. If that happens it's tough to imagine who might want to sign him and for how much."
"Dwyane Wade, Isiah Thomas, Marcus Morris, Karl Malone, Dwight Howard, and James Conner"
Dwight Howard as well
I agree Dwight going was a mistake. He has a cheap contract and was important to the Lakers bench bullying other teams during the regular season. I don't understand everybody lamenting the loss of McGee. He's a good energy player but I remember so many times the Lakers would struggle in the first quarter because they were dead set on starting him. I was under the impression gasol was a McGee replacement and Harrell was the Howard replacement. I don't think losing McGee affected the Lakers at all. Howard was the bigger deal.
"Honestly, I probably would've given the MVP to Dwight Howard that year when you consider both sides of the ball offensively and defensively"
Dwight Howard would like to disagree with you.
"This is hard because of the 1st team SF line up....I wanted to put LeBron, but then there's KD. But LeBron can play any position basically, so imma just put him at PF.   **1st team:**  PG: Steph Curry  SG: James Harden   SF: Kevin Durant  PF: LeBron James  C: Dwight Howard   **2nd team:**  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kawhii Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Marc Gasol  **3rd team:**  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Paul George  PF: Giannis  C: Joel Embiid"
2010s  Steph  Harden  Lebron  Durant   Dwight Howard   2000s  Nash  Kobe  Garnett  Timmy  Shaq   Honestly you can throw LeBron in that 2000s team too if you want
Marc Gasol and Dwight Howard both had better 2010s than AD.
It‚Äôs set up so the expansion team can‚Äôt win the lottery even if they have the best odds for at least a season or two.  It‚Äôs why the Bobcats got Emeka Okafor instead of Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard wasn't actively hurting his team jacking up 8 threes and constantly forcing isos in games
"I don‚Äôt think Giannis can dominate on defense better than Dwight. If Giannis was an elite perimeter defender while also being the paint protector he is then sure, but he isn‚Äôt. His best asset is his help defense/paint protection. Which was also Howard‚Äôs best asset, but Howard did it better."
If only he was a great playmaker and basketball mind like Dwight Howard.
"Kind of a similar story. I grew up training with a ""shot doctor"" that used to work with some pro players like Steve Nash and a bunch of other guys from the Canadian national team and stuff.  He got hired by Dwight Howard to teach him how to shoot free throws. Walked into the practice gym to Dwight bricking everything, told him to make like two small tweaks and suddenly Dwight couldn't miss. Dwight told him we were done here and never brought him in for another visit after that, reverted back to his old form, and continued being horrendous at the free throw line.  All of this was captured on video too; I used to crack up so much watching that knowing how much it could have made a difference for him if he had just continued working with this guy."
"Really cool idea but I have an analytics nitpick: This is highly skewed by using calendar decade periods so punishes players drafted mid-decade that spend most of their prime split between the end of their draft decade and the start of the following decade. Of course you'll have outliers like Kobe and KG that¬† went from HS to the league so were still at the tail end of their prime when the decade following their draft ended, but for most pre-2010s guys who played 2 to 4 yrs of college ball  or dropped off at 30 &amp; were drafted mid-decade (I.e. Jason Kidd, AI, CP3, Dwight Howard) -- they'll get shafted this way.   Maybe a 10 year moving average done at 5 year intervals to make up for that."
"A little disingenuous to say that one guy leaving his team and joining a team where one guy was drafted and been there 12 years and another for 3 years, all at age 33+, vs lebrons superteams as an example forming in one offseason:  - wade 28 (MIA), bosh 26 (TOR), James 26 (CLE) - kyrie 22 (CLE), love 26 (MIN), James 30 (MIA) - James 34 (CLE), kuzma 23 (LAL), Davis 26 (NO)  Not to mention the obscene amount of ring chasing discount veterans they brought in to each spot. (Ray Allen, Mike miller, deron Williams, shumpert, jr smith, gasol, Dwight Howard, wade, Danny green, rondo  etc just off the top of my head).   **Lebron was on his third super team by the age Charles hit the rockets. Kyrie is on pace for the same number by that age as well.**  Lebron (and other guys today) pretty much premeditating/colluding to get a whole team of prime stars together and then having a slew of vets taking the ring discount to hitch on for the ride. That‚Äôs a whole different ball game.  Even KDs first championship in GS was a team drafted and built from the ground up that he was only able to join because of a fluke cap jump. I get if you or other people hated it because outside of the injuries they were pretty much a lock to 3peat, but It‚Äôs not like they all came from different teams to GS.  The star cache where players are now essentially determining where/who they will play with and then playing GM with the create a roster, that didn‚Äôt exist in the old school era. It‚Äôs always taken multiple star players to win, that‚Äôs not what the ‚Äúsuper team‚Äù criticism is about, it‚Äôs the contrived way of colluding to make it happen, of taking big pay cuts to make it all feasible, unnatural nature of it."
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **Who‚Äôs *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"Its in a relatively same sense as the Celtics. Veteran players, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, Rondo, and AD are all veteran players with most of them having very concrete play off experience and success. Pre-2020 Danny Green as well. If someone told you five years ago these guys would all be on a team, it would have raised red flags for everyone.   Its incredibly similar to the Celtics of Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, and KG. Both even had Rondo. Only reason people didn‚Äôt call them that was because almost everyone on the team were given serious bad press. Rondo not being on contenders, Dwight and his series of injuries, AD and his injuries, Javale‚Äôs rep from Shaq, etc. Kawhi and the Clippers pretty much also stole a lot of the lime light as well."
I feel like he could have a lot of success if he played a similar role to Dwight Howard when he was with Orlando
"Or how about Dwight Howard &amp; Steve Nash?  *""This is gonna be FUN!""*"
Like Dwight Howard. Catching the bull up high then bring it down by a guards nuts so they can lock him up.
"&gt; Let's say you put Drummond on the 2017 Warriors and he has a + 10 rating over the course of two months with the Warriors having an overall net rating of 9. Drummond gets injured and is out for two months. They put Dwight Howard instead. Over the course of two months, Dwight has a +16 rating and the Warriors overall net rating increases to 15. That isn't worthless data. It's worthless if you don't use or understand it, though.  This is a perfect example of data you think isn't useless but is absolutely useless.  Who were they playing during those two months? What centers were they playing against? What exactly did Dwight do better than Drummond? Did KD have a hot streak during that time? How about Curry?  Without any of that context, that data that you gave an example of is worthless.  &gt; It's worthless if you don't use or understand it, though.  It should be used alongside tracking data to be able to quantify an actual useful stat. Without that, it's worthless."
"Teams prep for other teams. A player can be exposed. If another player pops into the line-up and has a higher +/- over a long-term period and the 2017 Warriors in turn saw an overall increase in +/-, then there is a decent enough pattern as to how a player will fit better. +/- is a stat. A stat is only as useful as to how it can be inplemented. PPG is also useless when not comparing players through certain rules.   Here's an easy example. Let's say you put Drummond on the 2017 Warriors and he has a + 10 rating over the course of two months with the Warriors having an overall net rating of 9. Drummond gets injured and is out for two months. They put Dwight Howard instead. Over the course of two months, Dwight has a +16 rating and the Warriors overall net rating increases to 15. That isn't worthless data. It's worthless if you don't use or understand it, though."
"Okay so we kept all those guys and AD and LeBron still got injured. Now what?   That‚Äôs why this discussion is so pointless.   Green and Howard would be free agents the same way Schroeder and Harrell are and you might sit back and say ‚Äúwow, the role players around LeBron and AD were so awful at hitting outside shots this year and they really could use another scorer or two. Maybe they should look at Schroeder, a young guard with some speed, he might be an upgrade compared to what Rondo gave them this season.‚Äù   ‚ÄúOh look, Montrez scored 14 off the bench this year and he‚Äôs pretty athletic, the Lakers had the #1 defense this year but they could use some more offense, maybe they should take a look at him.‚Äù  Such a completely pointless discussion.   &gt;Look at Rondo now still producing. Dwight. Same. Green. Same.  Who even knows if we make the playoffs with those 3 in our 9 man rotation while LeBron and AD were out in the second half.   Such a pointless discussion.  If LeBron and AD are hurt, literally nothing else matters. The Lakers tried something, and it didn‚Äôt work. If they kept the older players together, it still wouldn‚Äôt have worked. It‚Äôs pointless to even talk about this. You people would have come up with some thing you think Pelinka did wrong anyway.   You guys didn‚Äôt even like the roster that won the championship last year **until you saw it run through the entire west last year.**Just stop."
"I loosely enjoyed watching the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic for a couple years after the Sonics moved to OKC. Mostly because Rashard Lewis was there. They were fun to watch. After Dwight left, I sort of just enjoyed the game/league as a whole. Didn't really have a team nor favorite player. Just enjoyed the competition, but man, do I frickin' miss rooting for an NBA club and having that fandom. Hopefully soon."
"Dwight Howard has 3 consecutive DPOY‚Äôs, 5 consecutive All-NBA 1st teams, 5 consecutive years of being an MVP candidate, lead a team to the Finals and despite having a short peak was an 8x All-Star.  He definitely deserves to be on that list. Embiid and Lillard have a ways to go before they get on his level in any of those categories."
"I think Carmelo and Howard are pretty close to locks for me. Dwight was just so otherworldly in the 2000s, and those four DPOYs and the first teams he racked up are hard to overcome. But I hear you on how short his peak really was.  Embiid and Lillard just don't have the accolades right now for me to move them in there. I guess Miller doesn't really have accolades either but he has the longevity and career numbers to build his case. Having said that, I'd be fine swapping Reggie out for a number of other players (Lillard included)"
"Great job. I‚Äôm mot sold on carmelo, Reggie, and Dwight Howard.  Reggie was a performer and great at it. Carmelo has the longevity as a scorer and is probably the better choice of the three. Dho peaked quick and was amazing but there were some holes in his game. He was basically a lob finishing jumpman.  I‚Äôd sooner have embiid on there, although he‚Äôs probably a year or two away from getting the credit. Lillard? He hasn‚Äôt achieved in the playoffs but he‚Äôs an mvp candidate every year.  It‚Äôs too close to call and I can be easily swayed on this"
The dude looks like prime Dwight Howard with those shoulders. I'm blushing.
Josh Smith and Dwight Howard are two names that immediately pop up in my mind. Given their size and athleticism they both could dominate high school competition without Josh having a reliable jump shot and Dwight having no real scoring skills besides offensive rebounding and dunking.
"He doesn't look fat, he just looks clean. Looking like Dwight Howard is not normal or natural."
"I hadn‚Äôt considered the gold metal, and I ninja edited ‚Äúthe ring‚Äù right after I submitted, but I think you‚Äôre being intentionally disagreeable.   Gobert is a generational defensive talent and has an excellent argument as a hall of famer now, and he‚Äôs not even 30. Possibly not even in his prime.   Do you think Dwight Howard gets in? Because your answer to that would say a lot about where you‚Äôre coming from."
"Dr. J, Blake Griffin, JR Smith, Dwight Howard deserve shouts here too"
I sometimes forget Dwight Howard never won an MVP
"Well he‚Äôs never lost to the Clippers in the playoffs so there‚Äôs that, he shat the bed against MIA but he‚Äôs probably the biggest reason they beat the Spurs in the Conf Finals to get to play Miami. Portland series all the games were close and that was Dwight Howard/Parsons era; Blazers had a better team"
Laker‚Äôs rookies vs 2017 Warriors with Prime Dwight Howard
no Javala McGee is average and not a starter. Dwight Howard now is average but not a starter.   Rudy Gobert is a starting DPOY level centre who averages a double double. 70% of that is pretty high when you're the best in the game on defence.   Clint Capela is a good example but he also gets paid 20+ million
"Wow, what a stat that I have totally not heard 10000 times. Next youre gonna tell me Dwight Howard and Josh Smith were AAU teammates"
This is up there with ESPN claiming Dwight Howard would start at PF for the sixers.
"To be a superstar while being a defense first player you have to put a nice offensive effort as well. Dwight Howard is the prime example, he averaged 20+ points multiple times. Gobert averages 14. Mitchell is a great offensive player while being a more than decent defender."
Isn‚Äôt that just Clint Capella? Heck even JaVale McGee or Dwight Howard.
I feel like there were dudes who only got signed to foul Dwight Howard for a while
"First, Only people who don‚Äôt hoop say ‚Äòwanker‚Äô  Second, all of that is baked into the fact you‚Äôre passing to a role player. Bingo. Why couldn‚Äôt he just rise up without dribbling? Why couldn‚Äôt his release be quicker? Why didn‚Äôt he have the bball iq to jump into Gobert? Or maybe the balls to force that foul and walk to the line with 3 pressure packed FTs?  Because HE IS A ROLE PLAYER.   All of that is baked into why you want your star taking the shot. The role player does not have the natural talent to instinctively do these types things. In these situations you ask your role player to take wide open shots, nothing more.  The irony here is the last time this convo came up about ‚Äòthe right play‚Äô it ended with the OTHER Morris twin sailing a pass over Dwight howard in the finals. ‚ÄòMan that was an easy pass‚Ä¶why didn‚Äôt he pass to Bron‚Ä¶Dwight was wide open‚Äô. Sound familiar don‚Äôt it?! That is not in his wheelhouse for those situations.  And while most players arent blocking it, all are contesting it. So you‚Äôre passing up your star‚Äôs contested shot for a role players contested shot. Bad play"
I did it once and the people at Wendy's had no idea what it was about lmao. I think Dwight Howard is the only person who actually goes to get the free frosty
Can he actually shoot though?  Tonight Dwight frickin Howard hit **all** his free throws and Seth couldn‚Äôt  hit **any**...    They‚Äôre supposed to be free!
"He's better than that. He's Ben freakin Simmons, not post-prime Dwight Howard. Even when the defense is collapsing on the ballhandler and the play is breaking down he doesn't make any effort to make himself available on those possessions!"
"I‚Äôm not sure who I blame more in terms of Pelinka or LeBron and AD but I definitely blame someone for the FO moves.   Now, I understand that we simply couldn‚Äôt afford to bring Rondo back, so I have no issue with that.   Dwight Howard should‚Äôve absolutely been brought back. He‚Äôs still an effective big man, the game just isn‚Äôt played to his comfort level anymore. Danny Green was in a contract year I believe he historically plays well in those years. I‚Äôm also attempting to bring back Bradley if at all possible.   With a shortened season, and no practicing, I‚Äôm prioritizing chemistry over marginal potential offensive improvements.   And, I believe butterfly effect states that there no guarantee of injury under even just slightly different circumstances."
Featuring Dwight Howard as meatwad
Dwight Howard lookin like Cynthia from the rugrats
"Seriously. First glance at it I was like, who the fuck is this Howard guy? Oh shit that‚Äôs Dwight!?"
"Dwight Howard's hair looks crazy...but cool. I'm for the Hawks, but as a Rockets fan who remembers what a sweet guy he is, I can't not like Howard."
"Dwight Howard has that Subnautica hairdo. Feels like I wanna reach out, grab some of it and make a microwave."
I dont think Dwight Howard has forgotten how apparently everybody in the Hawks organization threw a celebration when he was traded
You know it's over when a guy named Shake is the best player on the court and Dwight Howard hits a free throw.
"Dwight ""Gamecock"" Howard"
"You know, I have a very high acceptance level for unique and out-of-the-ordinary hair styles. I admire people who are willing to be bold with their style.   But Dwight Howard looks absolutely ridiculous lol"
Ben Simmons has one more shot attempt than Dwight Howard btw
dwight howard lookin like dem zombies from Last of Us
Dwight Howard really turning 36 this year with that hairstyle lol.
that dwight howard smug face was hilarious with his haircut
Ik I‚Äôm in the minority but I love seeing a happy Dwight Howard

Coolio or Dwight Howard? Can't tell the difference.
Dwight Howard should be on /r/JustFuckMyShitUp
Dwight Howard is cosplaying as a pineapple tonight. Interesting choice.
Dwight Howard has become Old Dirty Bastard in more ways than his hair.
Dwight howard out there looking like cynthia from rugrats
*Dwight Howard in shambles*
Dwight Howard Trae young cage match
You do know refs are sketchy right? and it was called on Giannis..Dwight Howard..Karl Malone..
"I'm defending them because they literally won a championship nine months ago lol, a championship won in part by an excellent Dwight Howard signing and the best defense in the league that was built out of spare parts and minimum guys. Pelinka had a bad season this year but his track record is too good for me to decide he sucks now."
"Good breakdown. That's why it was always funny to me when they tried to compare Dwight Howard to Shaq earlier in his career. Dwight was a freak athlete, but he was nowhere near as big or as powerful as Shaq. He did not have the coordination and footwork in the lowpost and didn't really understand the nuances of post-play, it's an artform. Dwight was always much better as a pick n roll big, but he let the media, plus Barkley and Shaq get to him and he would force the post options even though he wasn't great at it. He also was not as good at reading defenses as Shaq, wasn't a very good passer."
"I said nearly every year. So yes, ""seriously"".   You realize before 2018 Harden had already played with KD, Russ, and Dwight Howard right?   My point still stands, Giannis has never had a teammate like one of those guys. Playoff success is tied to top end talent, not your 8 man rotation."
"Orlando Dwight Howard had better shoulders than some IFBB pro bodybuilders but hey it's ""genetics"""
"Houston's only notable free agent for almost two decades was Dwight Howard, and that was when they had Harden to recruit.   There are plenty of options to rebuild. Doesn't change the fact that they took a garbage deal for Harden and severely hurt their chances for a successful rebuild."
Dwight Howard vibes.
He shoulda won the Finals MVP in 10'. Thats a 1b in my book. Peak Pau was dadding Dwight Howard in his prime.
I'm sorry. But Dwight Howard plays straight Center. I had to put Shaquille O'Neal.
"Brooklyn actually did sign a good center they had Aldridge until he retired, Pretty sure what he is saying is that if you had doncic instead of Ayton you could always find another center whether it be a veteran minimum like a Dwight Howard or someone to fill the role that Ayton has right now, yea you wouldn‚Äôt get the same production obviously as Ayton but we‚Äôre talking about Luka being on the team now so you could have a lineup like Cp3 Doncic Booker, Crowder, Howard as an example"
"Pretty sure what he is saying is that if you had doncic instead of Ayton you could always find another center whether it be a veteran minimum like a Dwight Howard  or someone to fill the role that Ayton has right now, yea you wouldn‚Äôt get the same production obviously as Ayton but we‚Äôre talking about Luka being on the team now so you could have a lineup like Cp3 Doncic Booker, Crowder, Howard as an example"

"He didn‚Äôt say that, and their games aren‚Äôt that comparable other than being tall freaks who can dribble at an elite level. If anything Giannis is more like Young Lebron or Magic Dwight Howard (minus the last five minutes of post ups to end the game)"
"I'd agree with the statement that he was likely as athletic as most of the best athletes in the NBA. I'd even agree with someone who stated he was athletic as Dwight Howard in his prime. But like Dwight I'd refrain from considering him one of the most athletic because I consider coordination to be a part of the package when we're referring to the ""best"" athlete in the NBA. You can jump through the roof, but if you're relatively uncoordinated like Dwight or Wilt... you're not ""the best athlete in the modern NBA."""
With Dwight Howard and Shaq being Superman I can see the Batman nickname making sense (In addition to the Joker reference). Ayton is a height/length/athleticism freak somewhere in between Dwight Howard and Shaq.
Giannis is a slightly better prime Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard?   Washed Howard before he became impactful again? Gotta know and accept your role KP
"That‚Äôs just not true. When Dwight Howard first came into the league, he was 6‚Äô2 185 lbs. It wasn‚Äôt until he really bought into his coaching/training that he became the freak we know him as today."
"Basketball is a minimally physical game. No thanks.  Give me no jumping into defense, call holding on screens (fucking Dwight Howard), and truly penalize flopping"
"Imagine if KP spent a summer working out with a guy like Andre Drummond or Dwight Howard. Nothing but rebounding and shoulder presses. Dude could come out the other end being a double-double machine, cleaning the glass better than windex on both sides of the floor."
This seems like Harden and Dwight Howard all over again.
Dwight Howard had basically no post game coming in
relax he's not Dwight Howard
I saw a stat where Dwight Howard shoots 80% from the free throw in practice consistently but in games he‚Äôs awful. I think it might be a combination of fatigue and mental weakness with Simmons.
"I will never understand this idea though, have yall seen Ben Simmons shoot when warming up? I have and if he hits 30% of those it's a miracle. NBA players warming up hit 70% of their shots at a minimum, if Ben struggles when warming up what do you or Brett Brown think is going to happen in a real game? Dwight Howard hits more threes warming up than Ben Simmons, that speaks for itself.  He's gonna try and he is going to miss 90% of his shots until the Sixers beg him to stop, he is one of the worst shooters i have ever seen (and i'm pretty sure he shoots with the wrong hand). Being more agressive is one thing, but asking him to shoot threes like Brown did was not the answer."
You just ignored the entirety of this years regular season and post season where Ayton mirrored jokics minutes did a A1 job on him and didn‚Äôt get in foul trouble. I‚Äôm well aware that Ad guarded jokic in stints. Ayton did it all game every night.   Ayton didn‚Äôt have a Dwight Howard or McGee that was getting jokic frustrated from bs offensive fouls and was draining energy and taking the physical beating. You think Day to Davis is injured now? Lmao imagine if he was getting pounded by centers for 35 minutes a night. He‚Äôd literally be broken.
"All NBA players can. I remember that old leaked image from the Lakers locking room showing free throws in practice and they were all above 80%. Dwight Howard, who was like 60% in game, had 84% or something free throws in practice."
"Well I said if ‚ÄúIF Ayton‚Äôs playoff run becomes the norm, his floor becomes Dwight Howard‚Äù so even my statement has a qualifier.   But yeah I‚Äôve seen Dwight Howard as the best comp for a successful Ayton for awhile now.   And that is: an immensely gifted and physical player that is great at defense yet always was limited in his handles and ability to create his own shot, and not quite good enough to carry a team to a championship as the best player on a team."
did‚Ä¶ did you just say Ayton‚Äôs FLOOR was Dwight Howard lol
"I mean their roles in the offense are completley different and not at all comparable lol. In game 4 Ben had a lower USG% than Dwight Howard lol, of course he's not going to have many turnovers.  The ball is in Traes hands almost every  possession. Ben couldn't even play at the ends of games in this series when the 76ers were in the bonus because he was so useless offensively. Ben hardly handled the ball in the half court, of course he's going to have less turnovers than the guy who is not only the number 1 scoring option but also the teams best creator and facilitator lol. I'm baffled you are even trying to make this comparison lol."
Is anyone going to mention the zero minutes of quality play the the Sixers get off the bench from Dwight Howard? He looks like a lost child on the court. What a downfall from his heyday.
Dude Simmons is trash. He was the reason you lost. Not Dwight Howard
"Hah, I mean, Is he even good at managing superstar egos anymore? The way some of his players on LAC and PHI act on the court wasn't exemplary of this. The emotional and sometimes ridiculous actions/reactions by Blake Griffin, CP3, Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard all come to mind."
"mentally soft as fuck, just like his partner in crime, Dwight Howard. When things go south, they look like bitches. It's ok though, I'm sure he will leave real soon and save you guys the pain."
Prime Dwight Howard called Kendrick Perkins the toughest defender in the NBA. He was great for his role.
Dwight Howard sucked as hard as he could given his minutes. Thybulle wasn't great either.
Im a fake Sixers fan I only rooted for them because of Dwight Howard. If he signs with the Lakers I'm back to being a Lakers fan.  These are my confessions.
"Kobe would literally fucking murder him on national tv. Like, Dwight Howard would be teacher‚Äôs pet compared to Sinnons."
You said Curry was absolved from blame. Literally everyone had fatal flaws today. Dwight Howard and Simmons being the worst.
Someone needs to make the Peter Parker glasses meme template where it‚Äôs trae young and prime Dwight Howard lol
"I don't even know what else to say other than that this version of the Sixers is just the same team we've seen for the past few years. Embiid, Simmons, and Harris have never advanced past the second round and this is now their third attempt to do so, with the most favorable matchup they've had in that run.  I remember back in 2018 against the Celtics, and a lot of it just looked the same. Joel was a turnover machine in big moments, Simmons was an offensive liability, and no one on the bench could come up and play to the moment.  The hawks are a little inexperienced, Yes, and maybe that will cost them against Milwaukee. But the Sixers have no experience outside of Danny Green and Dwight Howard going deep into the playoffs."
"He‚Äôs faced and done well against some of the best big men in the game this playoffs with very efficient offense and defense and staying out of foul trouble.   If what we‚Äôve seen so far becomes the norm, his floor becomes David Robinson or Dwight Howard, and his ceiling starts to look like Tim Duncan or Shaq.   If he gets a couple championships early on, then you‚Äôve got a situation where Luka might not win as many ‚Äúchips‚Äù as Ayton when it‚Äôs all said and done.   I think the biggest difference between them is that Luka was already so polished at a young age playing in the pros already while Ayton was so raw with one year of college basketball. DA just had a lot of learning how to play basketball while Luka walked onto the the court superstar ready.   That skill gap has closed dramatically.   It‚Äôs always going to be an apples to oranges comparison because they are night and day as types how do you compare a QB to a left tackle.   It‚Äôs going to be a long career, but if DA stays this good and wins a ring already and Luka doesn‚Äôt improve, Ayton is going to have a better career."
"In the break, Dwight Howard will father another child."
I heard Dwight Howard has as many points as he does STDs.
I just learned Dwight Howard paid a throw up artist to fix his hair.

Harden did it for one year in 2017 and got a shitload more triple doubles than any other season, just off picking up a few more uncontested rebounds. LeBron doesn‚Äôt make a habit of it either. He also dribbles the air out of the ball to get his assists and points, but LeBron and Harden often do that too, they just do it well.  He‚Äôs also spent most of his career on shit teams that allow him to do that. Harden spent years playing with Capela and Dwight Howard, LeBron had Big Z and Bosh and Love and AD, those guys are gonna eat up a whole lot of rebounds that Payton‚Äôs teammates generally didn‚Äôt.  Some of it is just luck/stat padding too, LeBron famously comes up 1 assist or rebound short on a regular basis. Doesn‚Äôt happen so much to Payton."
What's up with veteran bigs fouling so much? Dwight Howard has been our foul machine the whole season.
"Serge Ibaka with the Clippers, won with the Raptors.   Dwight Howard with the Sixers, Won last year with the Lakers."
"&gt;no one thinks lebrons the one literally making trades, but he absolutely has the power to tell the team that they need to trade someone or for someone  bru even Dwight Howard did that on the Magic.... it's not a Lebron-specifc thing"
"its like saying build around Ben Wallace (at least Ben altho a 10 times better defender than fck up simmons) oh BIG Ben who was a terrible free throw shooter... was also a better free throw shooter than lil Ben.  Dwight Howard who was a guy that the Magic built around wasnt a POS on offence , he would get his 20 no matter what. He was always a threat , unlike lil ben who hides or goes completely AFK. or you know ""not impressed"" with the DPOY candidates while he gets torched for 30 a game from trae lollipop young."
Rondo and Dwight Howard
"At the time, *everybody* knew how dangerous it was. D'antoni knew too, but he just folded to Kobe and let him do what he wanted. From [this article:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29018331/from-archives-brutal-stretch-leading-kobe-bryant-achilles-tear-2013)  ""Jamison had never seen anyone so worn down, someone who, though four months shy of his 35th birthday, moved, Jamison said, like a ""105-year-old woman,"" who sounded so exhausted that when Jamison asked, ""Bro, you all right?"" his teammate, who by then had played more than 54,000 total minutes -- nearly 6,000 more than any NBA player ever at that point -- could barely even speak. Others feared too. ""We gotta protect him!"" Dwight Howard would plead to Lakers coaches, and the coaches tried. ""You've got to come out,"" head coach Mike D'Antoni would beg his star at the end of every first quarter, but the star's response was always the same: ""I'll tell you when I need to come out.""   ""It's the first time in his career that Bryant plays all 48 minutes of a non-overtime road game. He has played nearly 274 out of a possible 288 minutes in the past six games."""
When has prime lebron faced a dpoy and 2xmvp with the nets support cast? He got his ass kicked by Dwight Howard and the magic when he was in the cavs.
The circlejerk right now is also that anyone who says KD is better all time than Steph gets downvoted because KD lost yesterday. Nobody gave a shit about Curry until 2014 when he was a contender for best point guard in the league with CP3. I agree that Curry had a higher peak than KD but KD had more longetivity. Hell if KD was lucky like Steph was on 2015 he would already have a fucking ring. Imagine if Wade and Bosh got injured on the 2012 finals like Kyrie and Love did on 2015. I also find it laughable that people say Curry is better because he beated KD on 2016 and they are the same people that rank Duncan over Kobe even when Kobe defeated Duncan like 4 times and lost 2 times to him. One series doesnt determine who is the better player was Dwight Howard better than Lebron on 2009 too?
Imagine thinking you beat the refs in a game where Dwight Howard choke slams Lou Williams and they call a foul on Lou Williams.  And it stands after replay.
Shaq was horrendous from the free throw line as well. Was he also considered trash? Or Dwight howard?
Didn‚Äôt Dwight Howard just get one last year?
Giannis sorta looks like Dwight Howard in this picture. Also is this after he already joined the NBA? He doesn't look that skinny though his arms are blocked
"Pau Gasol defending Dwight Howard was expected to be a huge advantage for the bigger, stronger Howard, but Gasol's defense of Howard was masterful. The Lakers provided Gasol with significant help, and their defensive scheme was hugely successful in frustrating Howard, but Gasol deserves a lot of credit for his defense on Howard. According to ESPN DB, Dwight Howard was held to 4-10 shooting when guarded one-on-one by Gasol (Gasol, meanwhile, was 9-19 when guarded one-on-one by Howard). In Game 5, Gasol was the primary defender on Howard for in 38 possessions ‚Äì in those 38 possessions, Howard didn't make a single field goal, and went to the line only once, where he went 1-2, for a grand total of one points on 38 possessions with Gasol as his primary defender  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2009/6/16/911541/like-the-2009-lakers-great-teams?_gl=1*1xjb3ue*"
Dwight Howard was with Houston for 3 years and probably only played 50% of the games
"This is the stupidest shit I‚Äôve seen upvoted here all series. Yes you‚Äôre biased, and apparently the Sixers brigade in here after their win is real. It‚Äôs absolutely asinine to think the reffing crew actually conspired to rig the series in favor of the Sixers last game.   This is the same game where Embiid could *easily* have been ejected (and would have if he weren‚Äôt a star), where Dwight Howard surplexed Lou Williams and actually ended up as a foul on Lou (literally one of the most blasphemous calls I‚Äôve seen in my life), where Trae shot a grand total of 1 entire FTA more than Embiid this game who is whining to the media, and where the Sixers went to the bonus with over 7 minutes of play left in the 4th.   How anyone could think that a reffing crew rigging it in the Hawks favor would actually let all these things happen makes me seriously question your ability to function in daily life."
"Dwight Howard as well. Harden played with KD (on two different teams), Kyrie, Westbrook, CP3, Dwight, 5 different future hall of famers and still has not won a championship."
Dwight Howard‚Ä¶
"People casually forget that Dwight averaged 20 a game for multiple years on sky high efficiency in a much slower league, there's not even a comparison between Howard and Gobert."
"Dwight Howard, he was called for this violation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T8uRmwP1jE"
" in 2019 there was Danny green and marc gasol  in 2010 and 2008 ray allen  in 2009 dwight howard  in 2006 dwade  in 2005 and 2004 ben wallace   in 2002 and 2003 there was Richard jefferson  i can make the streak up to that point, i dont think i can with 2001"
Sources say Mark Cuban tried desperately to recruit Dwight Howard to the Mavs coaching team but failed
Dwight Howard disagrees. His dumb ass gets called for 2 a game.
It's not that he sucks at FT.   Ben Simmons sucks at free throws  Shaq sucks at free throws  Dwight Howard sucks at free throws  But Giannis. Not only does Giannis suck at free throws he takes him damn time to suck at free throws that the crowd countdowns how long it takes
"PG Sam Cassel (proper floor general/only real help wolves ever gave Garnett post Marbury)  SG Peja (2003-2004 seasons is one of the most underrated in history, came 4th in MVP voting)  SF Ron Artest (Biased but the Malice in the Palice overshadowed what was an MVP-level start to the season/was the leader of the Kings last time they made the playoffs lol)  PF Shawn Marion (fact that this man made 0 all defensive teams is one of the biggest nba voting errors of all time, as both a third star and roleplayer for Phoenix/Dallas the Matrix was a bit of a Swiss army knife)  C Dwight Howard (was a top 3-5 player in the league during the late 2000s and anchored a team to the nba finals, however people questioned if he was HOF worthy before he won a ring)"
"In 2007, despite not being an All-Star, he averaged more points than these stars:  - Chris Bosh - Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal  - Chauncey Billups - Caron Butler  - Vince Carter  - Richard Hamilton  - Dwight Howard - Joe Johnson - Jason Kidd  - Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal  - Tracy McGrady  - Kevin Garnett  - Tim Duncan  - Yao Ming  - Ray Allen - Carlos Boozer - Josh Howard - Allen Iverson  - Shawn Marion - Steve Nash  - Dirk Nowitzki  - Mehmet Okur - Tony Parker  - Amar‚Äôe Stoudemire"
"You cannot do that anymore. They changed it specifically because the hacking of shaq and dwight howard would destroy the pace of games. Now the rule is as follows:   Away from-the-play fouls, which are defined in Rule 4, Section III(h) on page 18, shall be administered as follows: A personal foul and team foul shall be assessed and one free throw attempt shall be awarded. The free throw may be attempted by any player in the game at the time the personal foul was committed."
"People have different personalities all the time. You obviously have your base character down. But you act one way at work, another way with your parents, another one when out with your friends, another when picking up the kids from school and so on.   I love competing and I love to talk shit while doing it. But I'm not talking shit when not playing because in that setting it makes no sense.   MJ seems like a dude who is almost always serious in everything he does. Dwight Howard seems the opposite - he'll goof around on and off the court.   Reggie was a killer when playing basketball, but a fun loving dude outside of it. These are balanced individuals with loads of sides to them. It's unfair to expect them to act a certain way all the time because of how they are on the court. It's just a bit of a parasocial relationship."
"To be frank, it‚Äôs not that surprising how creative he is with his plays and even moreso how good he is at managing the players. He played with Jordan on the wizards, Kobe and Shaq coached by Phil with the lakers, Tmac and Yao on the rockets, the Atlanta squad with ISO joe/horford/josh smith, Jason Kidd and Dirk on the mavs, and the Orlando squad that reached the finals with Dwight Howard.   On almost every team he‚Äôs been on, he‚Äôs played along with players who were the best during that era or with players who considered themselves the best. Combined with some of the best strategists of the game as well.   He‚Äôs probably seen and heard everything and learned how to deal with every situation accordingly. He wasn‚Äôt even phased after the iconic play when AI stepped over him.   He was born for this shit."
"Dwight Howard, probably"
Have you heard of Dwight Howard lol
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford, DeAndre Jordan were at one time All-NBA centers that are still kinda in the league, its just that ""pure"" big men just don't cut it anymore in the modern NBA.  Jonas Valanciunas, Steven Adams, Richaun Holmes kinda fit the bill, but aren't as dominant as the first group in their primes."
only reason why Dwight Howard is still playing
Even Dwight Howard had more makes/attempts this year beyond the arc
"Dang, so who does /r/nba side with on this: Dwight Howard or Scottie Pippn?"
"Lol no... Kyrie is not on the same planet talent wise, Kawhi is not nearly as quick and didn‚Äôt have the same vertical, harden not nearly as talented. The only one who is as talented is Lebron because of his height/size and he still had smaller hands, less vertical, less quick first step.   In terms of skill Kyrie is as skilled, but MJ is still a better finisher, better midrange. Harden handle I guess as well. All these guys can shoot the 3 better, but that wasn‚Äôt the meta back then and I‚Äôm sure if Jordan practiced it more he would have been better. He also wasn‚Äôt allowed to dribble to this level of carrying you can today.   Again if you look at a combination of skill and talent, these guys aren‚Äôt on MJ‚Äôs level... especially on talent alone. Lebron is the only guy who comes close talent wise and maybe someone like Dwight Howard but Howard can‚Äôt touch him skill wise.   And btw you originally you say plenty of people are more talented, skilled, AND gifted in your original post."
"Well, Dwight Howard had what looked like classic tren delts in his earlier years. I wouldn't be surprised if he was taking it during the offseason. It looks as if he's on a different stack nowadays, though."
"Joel had the best season of his career? Interesting. Who suddenly became his coach?  And if Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and the other Curry (pretty sure this one was all Brand) is what separated a poor roster to a good one, that roster was pretty damn good to begin with."
Remember when people upvoted the Dwight Howard stuff and the Coach Pop in his boxers threads?

These people have apparently never seen Dwight Howard knocking down 3s back to back to back in practice lol.  Real game is different
"dwight howard, dennis rodman"
Dwight Howard. And that Bullock guy from the Knicks.
Anyone else remember when Dwight Howard literally ran over Trae Young? Good times.
This is what Dwight Howard wanted to be in Atlanta
Look like Dwight Howard lol
I'm hearing Dwight Howard music
"What is this comment? Blake Griffins body is like 50 years old, at least KLove is still a great shooter. Dwight Howard, what is this 2010? Kawhi has a serious injury, there's no way he's going to olympics this year, and probably will spend the rest of the year rehabbing until 2022."
"Not really, Harris just suffered from no space when he's out there with Simmons, Thybulle, and Dwight Howard for extended minutes.  Bucks have far fewer holes in their roster construction"
yeah Rodman was a All-Star and DPOY....5-6 years before he joined the Bulls  are the 76ers a superteam cause they have former All-Star and DPOY Dwight Howard?  Maybe you need to check Wikipedia again lol.
"‚ÄúI saw it on nba.com, I‚Äôm not gonna link it but it‚Äôs real‚Äù enjoy Dwight Howard 2.0 LMAO. Imagine what‚Äôs gonna happen to him when he‚Äôs not fast enough to beat players to the rim anymore. He‚Äôll actually be worse than Dwight üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Dwight Howard and Pat Beverly
"He was only found taking a diuretic not doping ofc this could mean he was taking it to hide he was doping but he claims he was simply taking it for its intended purpose.  Even if he was taking it for doping though it still wouldn‚Äôt be a reason to hate him just because of how rampant it is in the league just look at lebrons delts or Dwight Howard, even skinnier players probably use it for recovery. That doesn‚Äôt make it right but it‚Äôs way more widespread and acceptable than the public are led to believe"
Reminds me of when Dwight Howard dunked over Tim Duncan with 0.08 seconds left to win the game. Best game I ever attended in person.
Dwight Howard did one
Tyson chandler did it in 2017(I think) while on the suns against grizzlies and it counted. Going back even further Dwight Howard did to against the Spurs 10 years ago
"It was Dwight Howard for years, in my opinion. Dudes such a cock, but it works well.  Even then, Dwight wasn't trash talking poor janitors"
Dwight Howard did it too
Dwight Howard had one with the Magic.
SAS tomorrow: Ayton is the next Dwight Howard
"I remember Dwight Howard had a big game-winning dunk in his Orlando days, huge oop from the sidelines, Dwight spins, reaches back and dunks it."
Dwight Howard against Spurs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1tkPzRgNRc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1tkPzRgNRc)
haven't seen it since Dwight Howard did it years ago
Dwight Howard did it years ago I believe
Shades of Dwight Howard over Duncan there
SHADES OF DWIGHT HOWARD!
Dwight Howard vibes üò≠üò≠
Dwight Howard did this
"The basketball gods demand that the Rockets have a good center. Elvin Hayes, Moses Malone, Ralph Sampson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, Clint Capella, and Christian Wood. There's a 100% chance they take Mobley. The universe commands it."
Cousins doing a dwight howard impersonation tonight
"Makes sense. Good teams don't get top 5 draft picks, and a star rookie is likely to stay on with their team for \~8 years, which means their chance of getting a ring is pretty low in the first decade of their career.  If you go back a few more years and start to include real free agency then the count changes drastically (KD, Wade, Bosh, LeBron, Bogut, Dwight Howard, Gasol, Adam Morrison, Darco, Shaun Livingston)."
Dwight Howard?
What about when you got Shaq and Dwight Howard and had two finals appearances
"Well it was a fan rivalry more than anything , the NBA definitely wanted it when they did the puppet commercials, we didn't see it a whole bunch in the regular season because they were, in different conferences and we got so close to it in the finals for a few years, had it not been for Dwight Howard, The Big Three Celtics, Dirk Nowitzki and then finally Kevin Durant , we could have had it at some point üòÇüòÇ"
"Meanwhile people are free to make all the homophobic comments they want about Dwight Howard, all because of that fake story that troll made up."
"Firstly, your English is great. Secondly, thank you for this write up. It makes sense thinking back and reading your post. This quality analysis will probably lost in all the crazy upvoted Ben hate posts but I at least appreciated it.   The fact is Doc is to blame for a lot of the issues and there's no excuse for not being able to recognize what's happening and counter when you're up 26 to finish out that win. But he was dealing with a lot of limiting factors:  -No Danny Green for most of the series.   -Ben absolutely cratered midway through the series.   -No stretch 5 on the roster, which means that Ben can't effectively run a bench unit where he just goes to work with shooters.   -Ben and Dwight absolutely cannot play together.   -Milton and Maxey take turns being unplayable, sometimes both of them. Doc has no idea what he'll get from game to game from them in this series.   -*Tobias Harris was not able to take advantage of a slower, less quick PF* (your analysis)  -Hobbled Embiid.   -The only reliable shooter after Green went down was Seth, who got absolutely roasted in this series, especially Game 7.   -He's forced to play Dwight Howard and basically live with the two to three ridiculous fouls or flagrants that he gets that are completely unforced errors.   These are just the major ones."
"2010-2020.  PG- 2016 Steph Curry (One of the reasons why 2016 was a goated season)  SG- 2013 Kobe Bryant (Dude was an animal until his injury)  SF- 2014 Kevin Durant (I really wanted to put 2013 lebron here but KD gets the edge for being one of my favorite players ever and this was his best season imo)  PF- 2011 Dirk- (For his amazing playoffs run)  C- 2011 (Dwight Howard- Prime D12 was that dude)   HM: 2015 CP3, 2018 James Harden, 2013 LeBron James, 2020 Anthony Davis, 2018 Demarcus Cousins"
I first read that as ‚ÄúDwight Howard asked Daryl Morey ‚Ä¶‚Äù and it seemed hilariously in character.
Lol dwight Howard
"Dwight Howard is a lock, Ginobili as well, Blake Griffin is borderline I know he said injuries but if he could maybe get a couple more All-Star appearances or at least be a valuable contributor to this Nets team on a championship level that could get him in         Jimmy Butler's borderline, and the NBA right now is so guard heavy, there are some damn good guards that I could see not making it just because of the competition level obviously he's injured now but look at a Jamal Murray even compared to his other peers that are 25 and younger just as an example so it's tough to say"
Lol why are you pulling up stats from 2015 where Harden not only wasn't at his peak but also he had Dwight Howard who was another all star and who obviously made the team better when Harden sat  Pull up the data from 2017 or better yet 2019
Dwight Howard is in that same boat
Dwight Howard with the Magic was notorious for practicing free throws non stop in practice yet still being utter ass at them in game
"PJ Tucker, Dwight Howard, and Ed Davis are three players I would love to have on the team next year."
"There is no player between him and the basket in a free throw situation.  There is no excuse.  Even Dwight Howard works on it relentlessly, changing form, changing positions, changing where he shoots it."
Reminds me of when our team fell apart in ‚Äò17 and then we signed Dwight Howard
What a load of horse shit. Ben Simmons and Dwight Howard have each earned every ounce of criticism they've gotten. Hard to imagine whether or not Dwight would have ever matured without all that criticism.
That‚Äôs NBA champion Dwight Howard to you.
Go Dwight Howard!
"Of course it‚Äôs still head and shoulders above the rest.  But that‚Äôs not my point, usually USAB in the Olympics is an exhibition of the best of the best basketball has to offer at every position.  I have an affinity for the Center position because it‚Äôs what I used to play.  2016- DeAndre Jordan , Boogie Cousins, Draymond   2012 -Tyson Chandler, Kevin Love, AD  2008 -Dwight Howard, Boozer, Bosh  2004 -Garnett, Mourning  1992- Ewing, Robinson, Malone, Barkley   Don‚Äôt you think the current big lineup is underwhelming in comparison to those ?"
In the Dwight Howard thread?
No one is more qualified to comment on wasted talent than Dwight Howard.
Bro when I was in high school 2009 we had a HUGE got milk poster in the cafeteria with Dwight Howard and a milk mustache covering basically the whole side of the cafeteria
"Dwight Howard is right overall but that ""city of brotherly love"" shit is just a straight fuckin lie lol"
Dwight Howard actually showing some class.
"I respect the hell out of Dwight Howard for doing what hes supposed to do during this time.     But objectively, if the 76ers want to win a chip, they can't play Ben Simmons at point guard."
"""that's my ~~quarterback~~ teammate""      ~~T0~~ Dwight Howard"
"I think it's kind of messed up, and telling, that Dwight Howard is willing to stand up for Ben, while Doc is perfectly content to throw him under the bus."
"Big fan of what Dwight Howard did there - when your brother struggles you stand by him and help pick him up, you don't throw him under the bus.  What really got me was the part where he reminded folks that Simmons is a 24-year-old kid. This should not be underestimated or overlooked.  Simmons will absolutely be better next season."
Dwight Howard has nearly $250 million in career earnings and still posts IG videos after getting his free Frosty.
"Just when I thought Dwight Howard couldn't possibly be any cringier, he goes and says something like this... and totally redeems himself!"
"As UT says, having Dwight Howard makes being fucked all but a given.  (inb4 ""he won a title last year"")"
Dwight Howard is gay according to social network media.
Dwight Howard surprising leadership and good teammate qualities
"I don't necessarily think the perspective comes from winning a championship, Dwight Howard has been in the position Ben Simmons is in now. Rightly or wrongly, people blamed him for his teams failures."
Dwight Howard showing real veteran leadership here. What a good bloke. Class act.
"Why are the trail blazers the 4 seed?  Dwight Howard, come to Milwaukee."
What happened to his nose? I guess more specifically who the fuck got in a fight with dwight fuckin howard and broke his nose? That person dead now?
I think he kinda relates to Ben. Dwight Howard got a lot of hate his first stint as a young man with the Lakers
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Seth Curry F: Danny Green F: Tobias Harris C: Dwight Howard
"2011-2021   PG - Ben Simmons   SG - Tony Allen   SF - Thabo Sefolosha   PF - Kristaps Porzingis   C - Rudy Gobert    Bench - DeRozan, Dwight Howard, Joe Harris"
*Dwight Howard becoming a model teammate* certainly wasnt on my NBA bingo card back in 2012
"Shaq was great at reading doubles/triple teams, it's an artform. People don't appreciate it enough. Dwight Howard also struggled throughout his career dealing with double teams in the half court."
Well...I think we all know that Ben is at least capable of playing better than that.   And I'd like to think some of his struggles might have to do with a coach who makes him share the floor in the 4th with Dwight Howard...or the city that is notoriously unforgiving of its sports stars.
giannis over his career has played 32.5 minute per game kawhi has avged  31.3 lol.... giannis also missed 10 games this season with knee problems.  Additionally if we look at other players physical players who dunk a lot they generally do not age well  examples being  blake griffin and dwight howard.
It's the DJ fiasco. I remember working my shitty retail job just refreshing the page every few minutes and dying at every update.    But seconds are the Bucks fans pitch to Dwight Howard. Or the tweets about Marcus smart yelling stuff from the bathroom.
"How come Embiid gets a pass in all of this? His conditioning is shit, he gets hurt often, and he‚Äôs soft. Biggest flopper in the league after Marcus smart.  He‚Äôs a big mouth loser that never beat anyone but it‚Äôs Brett Brown‚Äôs fault, or Doc‚Äôs, or Harris‚Äô, or Simmons. Embiid is the anchor right? The best player on the team? The face of the franchise? Always puts it on others. Joel got a bit of Dwight Howard in him."
"As long as CP3 or Giannis get a ring, I‚Äôll be happy. Kawhi already has two and Trae is young, with plenty of time to win one. It‚Äôs always great to see these all time guys get a ring finally. This is how I felt last year when Dwight Howard finally got one after 16 seasons."
but i don't want Dwight Howard to retire yet
George Hill and Dwight Howard
"Lebron played well but anyone who watches lebron knows he wasn't even at 80%. Hes lebron of course he can catch lobs with a bad ankle. But you are still hurt and u still have the thought of reinjuring the ankle when driving.  And I like the heat, but everyone knows that Lakers Vs Heat match up Heavily favored the Lakers..  You're talking abt Anthony Davis , Mcgee and Dwight Howard vs Bam Adebayo and a bench stretch 5..  Kcp , rondo, Alex Caruso vs dragic, and lebron vs butler   In that match up lakers were Heavy favorites. No one can say suns were favorites against lakers nuggets or clippers if both sides r healthy. Its all good. Even if they win 1 , let's see what they do going forward when everyone gets a full off season of rest and everyone isn't injured"
"I suppose it depends on what someone means by 'rank all time', doesn't it? I personally take it to mean, which players are the objective best players. Some people may think ""which players had the best achievements all time?"".  Patrick Ewings great sin in the achievement field is that he played at the same time as Hakeem Olajuwon(better centre), David Robinson(better centre), Shaq(better centre), Michael Jordan(Won titles in the years Ewing had the best shot).   All these players I just named are on your list and Ewing had to compete for achievements against them.  What great all-time centres or players on this list were playing at their peaks that Dwight Howard had to compete with?"
Dwight Howard above Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning? Garbage.
Jordan  Lebron  Kareem  Magic  Bird  Duncan  Kobe  Wilt  Shaq  Russell  Olajuwon  Curry  Robertson  Durant  Moses Malone  Erving  Baylor  Dirk  Wade  West  Barkley  Karl Malone  Garnett  Harden  Kawhi  Westbrook  Chris Paul  Robinson   Nash  Ray Allen  Worthy  Stockton  Dwight Howard  Iverson
I think something like Booker and Ayton is really good. I‚Äôd try something like‚Ä¶ Kobe and Dwight Howard.
Mike Conley and Tony Allen were out and Dwight Howard had a torn MCL but still played
"And btw even the match before 2006 , when we played you in 2004 the match was pretty close.It was 77-71 if I remember correct. And even in the match we lost in 2004,we had 0 NBAers (except one dude who passed by the NBA but was not an active NBAer at the time) facing a team that had :AI,Wade,LBJ,Duncan,Shawn Marion,Amar'e Stoudemire etc. Now compare that USA team with Canada.  The year we won the USA basketball team the team had: Dwight Howard,Lebron,Melo,Wade,CP3,Bosh,Hinrich with Mike D'antoni as an assistant coach.  Canada talent is not bad,but such rosters are not EVEN CLOSE."
"IIRC there were bosh for dwight howard rumors, that could‚Äôve happened  no way they trade wade though, that‚Äôs their franchise legend"
Is that Dwight Howard in the crowd
"All 4 of his rings are equally legit and anyone who thinks LeBron, Wade, and Bosh should‚Äôve felt obligated to keep wasting years with absolutely no shot to win the title in the situations they were all in in 2008-2009 instead of forming a big 3 of their own to counter Boston‚Äôs because ‚ÄúBoStON tRaDeD fOr Kg aNd AlLeN BrUh‚Äù is a fucking moron. All that matters from the player‚Äôs basketball perspective is that they had 3 stars (and later a 4th with Rondo) when they stepped on the basketball court. Bron, Wade, and Bosh did absolutely nothing wrong and they did something that many fantastic teams before them were unable to do and that‚Äôs win back to back titles. Congratulations to those 3 boys.  In Cleveland he beat the 73-9 Warriors with Kevin Love averaging 8 points on 35% shooting in the finals (not to mention the year before when Love got hurt in the 1st round and Kyrie got hurt in game 1 of the finals and LeBron singlehandedly pushed the Warriors to 6 games with the sorriest group of turds to ever play in the finals). So trying to discredit that ring with sUpErTeAm is equally as dumb as thinking that big 3s are only allowed to be formed via trade and not free agency. Congratulations to those boys and the city of Cleveland.   The Lakers 3rd best player in their title season last year was either KCP or Dwight Howard. ‚ÄúBuBbLe BruH iT wAs ThE BuBBlE MicKEy MoUSe BrUh.‚Äù The bubble fucked the Lakers over as it took away the very important 1 seed homecourt advantage they earned all year. As the great Giannis said before the playoffs, that was actually the HARDEST ring you could possibly win. Congratulations to all those boys.  The only actual meaningless rings in recent memory are Kevin Durant‚Äôs 2 in Golden State. He literally just added himself on top of a team coming off a 2 season stretch with 140 regular season wins, back to back finals appearances, and a ring without him. Just tacked himself on top of a ready made machine in place of Harrison f*****g Barnes. Obviously the part where he had just blown a 3-1 lead to them was the cherry on top. And fuck me, even in 2019 they swept the WCF without him and were on the verge of forcing a game 7 in the finals before Klay got hurt. They still might‚Äôve won the chip without him that year if Klay didn‚Äôt get hurt lol. The hilarious part is the schmucks who shit on LeBron‚Äôs rings in Miami are the same idiots who try to say that KD is as good or better than LeBron lol. Not to mention KD had Russ and Ibaka from day 1 in OKC and then also got a few years of Harden while LeBron‚Äôs best teammates in Cleveland were Zydrunas Ilgauskas and 2 years of Mo Williams.  LeBron James (nor anyone else in league history) has ever done anything remotely similar to that as he has never played on a team that would have a fucking prayer in hell to win the title, make the finals, or win 73 games without him if you replaced him with Harrison Barnes. Miami could‚Äôve been a 2nd round playoff team and that‚Äôs about it. Fuck KD and hopefully we don‚Äôt see that ever again.  Tl;dr: Fuck the original Boston big 3 and many thanks to the Miami big 3 for coming together to shit on them. Also Fuck KD and he‚Äôll never be Bron."
"Prime Dwight Howard for bigs, prime LeBron James for wings, prime Derrick rose for guards."
"They don‚Äôt need to rush him back. Plus Hawks need to prove they can stop Lopez abusing them, Lopez playing vs the Hawks inside on offense is like prime Dwight Howard lmao."
I would put Dwight at the 4 and Embiid at the 5. Imagine prime Howard and Embiid in the frontcourt? Imagine the number of rebounds and block shots that would have combined? It would be scary.
"I'd rather have the 24 and the 30, considering the 22 YO literally said he had to refind his love for basketball after like his 2nd season.   Ben Simmons is young Dwight Howard minus the antics; really good at certain things, bum-stupid at others, not a leader, but also not a follower either. You're not winning a title with a guy like Simmons in your top 3. He's shown time and again that he doesn't have the mentals for it. Jimmy, on the other hand, showed that he did, and in the most uncomfortable playoff setting in NBA history no less."
"Jokic single-handedly makes your team a championship contender. He can shoot from anywhere on the court and run your offense better than almost anyone in the league. I think that's more valuable than Dwight's contributions to his team.  Also, Dwight and Jokic have had pretty similar playoff success. Dwight made the Finals once (as a star), and Jokic made the Conference Finals once. When you consider the level of competition, the difference is negligible. Do you really think a team whose best player is Dwight Howard could beat the Kawhi/PG Clippers in a playoff series?"
I perhaps made that sound easy.  But it's surprisingly hard to win and title with the lakers and make the HOF.  I think like 28 Lakers have made the hof.  But only a handful have won a title there. (Not counting Minneapolis Lakers)  Put it this way.  I can't find a HOF laker who has won a title with the LA lakers and isn't up there.     So that's why I think if he snags one more.  He'll be up there for sure.   Dwight Howard and possibly Rondo will ruin my theory though lol.
Dwight Howard was an All-Star averaging 17-12 in his third season‚Ä¶come on.
"&gt;	DA‚Äôs efficiency is damn near unprecedented statistically  That is solely due to where and when he gets his touches. I like Ayton but he‚Äôs not some sleeping post giant. He rolls to the rim and dunks.  &gt;	he‚Äôs reminding me of a Dwight Howard with handles, or a muscular Tim Duncan  Bruh."
I was clowning on Cauley Stein being taken at 6 and people were telling me he was going to he a Dwight Howard light  It's insane how many people don't actually watch college basketball
"How the hell nobody mention JR Smith, Dwight Howard, Jason Richardson, Shannon Brown, Larry Nance JR etc lmaooo. Y'all just naming star players bro. Shit man. Do y'all homework!!"
Dwight Howard?
They likely don't get D-Rose if he goes there.  So that impacts a lot of legacies.  I would have liked to see him go to Phoenix or something and team up with Steve Nash to overthrow the Spurs.  Or maybe with a young Dwight Howard? Eh? :)
"There was the one year in the Olympics or one of the FIBA tourneys where it killlllled USA. I recall Duncan being on the team and getting killed every time (as well as everyone else). The opposing teams were picking the ball off of the rim on every single free throw attempt and lay up. If someone like Dwight Howard or someone like that grew up practicing picking the ball off the rim the second it makes contact or just slapping it away, he would be a monster on defense."
"Not the exact comparison I wanted to make. Nor do I think MVP race is a good measure of how good players are as it‚Äôs mostly an award based on team success (not always and definitely not as of late).   Dwight Howard was in the top 5 four years in a row and finished 2nd to Derrick Rose in 2011. Neither of them were better than Lebron‚Ä¶nor Embiid talent wise.  Blake Griffin was 3rd in 2014 but doesn‚Äôt come close to Yao‚Äôs level of skills despite his absence in the top 10 in any year.  I don‚Äôt know if The MVP race (not talking about the actual award/winner) is a good measure of skills‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.which is my original point ‚Äî Yao had all the intangibles, although I‚Äôd still give Embiid the edge for his dribbling and overall defense. I was simply trying to point out the level of talent but the lack of availability of both players."
"Muscular Tim Duncan is aspirational but his floor is easily Dwight Howard. Dwight was a monster physically, but struggled to get his own shot. And DA is showing multiple moves around the basket.   DA has already done well against: AD, Lebron, and Jokic."
"&gt; I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre seeing DA at his best but he‚Äôs reminding me of a Dwight Howard with handles, or a muscular Tim Duncan.  I think DA is showing that he‚Äôs a lot better than most people thought he was before the playoffs and there‚Äôs a good chance he develops into an all-star eventually. However, ‚ÄúDwight Howard with handles‚Äù and ‚Äúmuscular Tim Duncan‚Äù are insane comparisons, that would make DA the GOAT."
"His points are only limited by his touches, DA‚Äôs efficiency is damn near unprecedented statistically and the Suns would benefit by getting him more involved.   But that‚Äôs not all DA does, he plays a damn fine defensive game and sucks in rebounds.   He‚Äôs not Shaq, well maybe a not in his prime, what about a super young Shaq. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre seeing DA at his best but he‚Äôs reminding me of a Dwight Howard with handles, or a muscular Tim Duncan."
"Yeah at the start of that 04-05 season they had a back court of prime Francis and Mobley, with Francis coming off 3 straight all star games, a rookie Dwight Howard and a finally healthy Grant Hill. People seem to forget Hill made his final all star game that season and was finally able to play a majority of the games after missing most of the past 4 years. Trading Mobley really killed any momentum that team might've had."
Honestly Giannis is like a hybrid of Dwight Howard and David Robinson. Except faster and more agile than both.
Dwight Howard won with the Lakers though?
Dwight Howard was in a similar situation in 2009. Never sniffed the Finals again. Your first opportunity could be your last.
"Yeah, I find it hard to just say he was better than Ewing cause the game was much different back then.  Even if you put aside the awards trying to compare their numbers straight up even seems uneven.    Defensively as a shot blocker I was going to say Dwight had an edge, but looking at their numbers Ewing averaged more than half a block more per game than Dwight has, and Ewing's highest season he averaged 4 a game. Dwight's highest season he averaged 2.9.  After watching some Ewing highlights since I missed most of his career its clear his offensive game had way more polish and range than Dwight ever has.  He had a play where he hustled to grab a rebound before it went out of bounds in the corner, jumped and knocked down the three while falling out of bounds.    I like me some Dwight Howard after he was so integral to the Lakers run last year, but I think I would have to rank Ewing ahead of him all time."
Dwight Howard the dude who won 3 straight dpoys in a row the dude who was snubbed for mvp sorry d rose but it's true the dude who kicked prime Lebron's ass in the playoffs Dwight howard superman the man amongst men dude like muscles like hulk can fly like superman and in his prime could out rebound anyone (this is just hype everything may or may not be factual)
I‚Äôm with you on this.  This thread is way overrating Dwight Howard.  Top 10 talent not a top 10 career or mindset.
Not really. It's really funny how r/NBA tries to discredit Kobes first 3 rings with Shaq. Despite Kobe being a top 3 player and putting up 27ppg in those playoff runs.  And then at the same time act like Kareem is top 2-3 all time because he has 6 rings. Would love to hear the argument of how Kareem averaging 12/7 on 25 mins a game as the 4th option means his 6 rings puts him over Kobe's 5.   Getting a couple rings at the end of your career as a washed up player like Dwight Howard or Gary Payton shouldn't have that much of an impact on your legacy and ranking. But for some reason this is the core of Kareems goat argument. No one who puts Kareem that high on their list actually knows anything about his performance those last few years and it's obvious.   Magic Johnson was the Shaq of those 80s Lakers. He's the reason they won all 5 of those chips while Kareem's Lakers were getting swept by Jack Sickma before they drafted him.
"I think that's more a product of fan perception / how well liked a player is than objective talent / being better than.  I think the fact that a lot of people (myself included) think Dwight failed to realize the extent of just how great his potential was, makes people think less of what he was still actually able to do.  For reference, Wallace never scored over 10 PPG in his entire career (his 5 year peak was around 8 PPG) nor over 50% from the line.  Wallace is without a doubt one of the greatest defenders ever, but he never came even close to the two-way threat Howard was in their primes.  While it's much easier to root for Wallace I don't think it's particularly close with how much better Howard was."
"What if Dwight Howard came off the bench? Now how important is ayton?  I don't like to color the thinking based on who the backups are. Overall, ayton is adding a ton üòä don't need to know who is most important, like I don't need to know the most important part in a Ferrari - it's the integrated vehicle that matters, and it's made well due to complementarity"
"It‚Äôs not a scoop, it‚Äôs just SVG trying to paint a pro-player image of himself in the media once again after being fired in hopes of getting re-hired. Refused to admit problems with Dwight Howard and now about the Pels bunch. You know inside he‚Äôs seething."
üéµ DWIGHT HOWARD IS COACH KILLER üé∂
"This title might be the best thing I've seen on /r/nba since the ""please come to Milwaukee, Dwight Howard"" post."
Bosh was the better all around player with more all star selections and this would not even be a close argument if blood clots hadn‚Äôt ended his career early. Dwight was a hulking presence who could never shoot from outside 10 feet or even a free throw. If you don‚Äôt remember how good prime Bosh was on the Raptors and how he used to spread the floor as a shooting big and torch my Celtics in the playoffs and lockdown on D then ya maybe prime Dwight was as good. There‚Äôs a reason Howard only has one fake bubble ring and inflated statistics; he played the meaningful part of his career with a horrible Orlando team where he was the #1 option and had the ball dumped into the post every time. Howard and Bosh are both HOFers but the dynamic nature of Chris Bosh is truly what separates him from one dimensional players such as Howard.
"How does Bosh have better individual accolades than Dwight Howard?   To quote Wiki  [Dwight Howard] is an NBA champion, eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA Team honoree (5x 1st team, 1x 2nd team, 2x 3rd team), five-time All-Defensive Team member, and three-time Defensive Player of the Year.  Meanwhile Chris Bosh has more rings (2&gt;1) rings, more all-stars (11&gt;8) but only 1x All-NBA (2nd team) compared to Dwight‚Äôs 8."
"I think people forget how good Dwight Howard was in his prime. Heck, he averaged a double double every season until two years ago."
Dwight Howard. I dont think its close either
"Kinda makes me wonder how an All-Old team would look. Only taking folks from the oldest 20 players in the league, I‚Äôve got:   PG: Chris Paul, Goran Dragic  SG: JJ Redick, Andre Iguadola   SF: LeBron James, Trevor Ariza   PF: Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap  C: Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol  Honestly, that‚Äôs not a bad team. I‚Äôd call it a second round exit, maybe conference finals."
"Ya, but I just thought of Dwight Howard, Giannis, and Karl Malone. That probably means all three of them juiced too but we‚Äôre just better at hiding it."
Yes they also tolerate Dwight Howard who is just a goon
That‚Äôs vintage Brooke ‚ÄúBrooke Lopez for Dwight Howard who says no‚Äù Lopez
"You forgot that he's No 1 overall in blocked shots.  Before anybody comes in with the Kareem stuff, I know, Kareem or Wilt probably have the ""real"" record but its still worth mentioning. I also think it's worth mentioning that Hakeem had a real knack for maintaining possession on a blocked shot too.  A lot of guys these days want to spike it into the crowd as a show of intimidation (like young Dwight Howard), but Hakeem aways tried to deflect to a teammate or sometimes he would simply sky for the block and grab it out of the air entirely."
Everyone juicing in the NBA. Check Lebron and Dwight Howard first then get back to me
"[insert any player with an MVP award], Melo, Dwight Howard, Rondo, and Chris Paul."
"LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Chris Paul   Dwight Howard   Carmelo Anthony   Russell Westbrook   All of them could retire tomorrow and would still be first ballot. You have others who‚Äôd get in but not 1st ballot because of a lack of longevity(Jokic , Giannis, etc)"
"You saw what happened with kobe Dwight and Nash? Kobe and Howard didn't get along, nothing cp3 could do. I say 0 titles, not even a win in the 1st round of the playoffs"
"Dwight Howard was prep-to-pro so he took a team to the finals at 23  From 2007-13 he averaged 20/13.7 with 2.4 blocks and DPOY defense   In that time frame, he got 3 DPOYs, led the league in rebounds 5X and blocks 2X"
"Okay but then explain:  * Dwight Howard * Lamarcus Aldridge  * DeMar DeRozan * Ibaka * Westbrook  * Paul George  * Harden * Hayward  * Whiteside   Basically Kawhi, LeBron, and Carmelo picked big cities in the last decade and that‚Äôs it.   Most of the time big cities are leverage. Most players re-signed with their team or went where they had a shot at the title"
"Don't think it would be too controversial to say that for at least a season or two worth of games, Dwight Howard was up there. If not for injuries and immaturity stunting his skill development he could have cemented his place on the Mt Rushmore of bigs."
I actually disagree. If Marc Gasol or Dwight Howard can win a title at 34/35 Embiid can certainly play a factor in a Finals run.  He won‚Äôt be the same dude but he‚Äôs not limping out of the league at 32. The guy had some issues early but I can‚Äôt imagine him breaking down completely anymore. He‚Äôs played a ton of games so far.
"LA still loves Dwight Howard, which if you were to tell me this in 2014 I would've been been super confused lol"
I didn't realize there was a bigger baby than Dwight Howard.
"Apart from it‚Äôs more embarrassing to most guys than air-balling, he‚Äôs actually gotten better. Both Dwight Howard and Deandre Jordan were TERRIBLE free throw shooters. I mean the WORST.  But they actually dramatically improved the last 2 or so seasons so it‚Äôs not impossible to figure out the timing, or the specific shot on the free throw line that works best for them.  Now‚Ä¶ Ben Simmons on the other hand, üëµüèª‚Ä¶"
Did LeBron James really give Dwight Howard a blowjob at that party in 2010.
"As a Sixers fan, I expected to not like Howard with his track record, but loved having him on the team. Had some nice moments in the regular season, and really seemed to hype up and support our younger players.   Somehow, Dwight Howard was a positive influence on our locker room. No hatred from me."
"Yeah I get you. I wasn‚Äôt trying to say ayton is on AD‚Äôs level at all, just that pulling Dwight Howard and sliding AD to the 5 isn‚Äôt the same as a normal team pulling their center. I just think that the clippers have a unique way of eliminating big men from really affecting their small ball lineup that the rockets never really had"
"Da bess  2009 NBA champions: Los Angeles Lakers* Asterisk reason: Kobe Bryant dodges LeBron James yet again. King James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 8.0 assists for the 66-win Cavs in the Eastern Conference finals, and somehow it wasn‚Äôt enough. Of the 229 individual opponents that Kobe faced at least 20 times in his career, Kobe‚Äôs lowest win percentage came against LeBron, losing 6 of his 22 games against the four-time MVP, per Basketball Reference. Kobe and the Lakers faced Dwight Howard instead. Lakers catch another break."
"Different injuries.  People still get killed by herniated disks, that's the injury that turned Andrew Bogit and Dwight Howard into role players."
"&gt;I really wish someone could explain what Doc was supposed to do to overcome that.  Well you COULD run some actions for Ben. Brett's offense at least got Ben involved in some low post seals on the break, cross screens with Joel, pin downs with our shooters etc. Doc relegated him to the dunker spot even MORE than we've seen the last few years. I think we probably would've won the series if Doc doesn't play a 10 man rotations and keep going to Dwight Howard and the bench lineup when it wasn't able to score all year. Doc came out game 1 with Danny on Trae and lost us game 1. Ben goes on him game 2 and we rattle off back to back 16 point blowout wins. So yeah, a better plan A, not going to his all bench lineup, and actually trying to get Ben involved in the half court. I'd start there"
"Chris Paul, Chris Bosh, and Dwight Howard was my dream Big 3 back in the late 2000‚Äôs."
"By that logic, the clippers going small ball against the Suns should be bbq chicken because of Ayton. But it isn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the point of the post. They have a weird way of getting all of the benefits of running small ball on offense without getting killed by big lineups on defense. The lakers took advantage of the Rockets on offense when they went small.  Also, it‚Äôs not like benching Dwight Howard and having AD play center is forcing the Lakers to go small. AD can easily play center, he just prefers to play PF."
In the league? Dwight Howard was as well.
"Dwight Howard is the Burger King of the NBA. Everyone loved him in the 2000's and 2010's, but after awhile, he just became a parody of himself."
Dwight Howard?
"I never said it was complicated ""dude"".  I said I don't get the joke to put someone on the spot before a big game.  And you ever heard the term ""read the room""?  Like Dwight Howard is the guy you do that shit with not fucking KD.    Do I need to explain to you how personal he takes everything?&gt;"
"People talk about all the most formidable 5s being from other countries, but the US still has the undisputed best depth there, AD, Adebayo, Jarrett Allen, Dwight Howard, Myles turner, jonathan Isaac..just too many injuries and sit outs this year.  This roster is a mix of America‚Äôs B or C team plus Durant. Still medal favorites.  Would love it if stars saw the olympics as an opportunity to flex their pesky defense skills without worrying about getting gassed. Would be fun to see a defensively minded roster. The league‚Äôs 12 best defenders would probably be an offensively decent squad anyway."
Dwight howard
"No joke. Dwight Howard, and that was many many years ago."
I'd just recreate a super version of Dwight's 4 out 1 in teams. Lol.   Steph Curry as Jameer (sharpshooting point)  Kobe Bryant as Courtney Lee (two way guard)  LeBron as Hedo (point forward)  Kevin Durant as Rashard (big SF playing PF)  Dwight Howard as himself (defensive anchor)
"Dwight Howard was pretty good,  but I wouldn't put him in the great category"
"You see prime Dwight Howard being absolutely posterized by lanky Rudy Fernandez was all part of the team USA ""walking through"" the tournament."
"I get what you‚Äôre coming from but hear me out bro: if buddy is in the wing, the opposing team has to choose between playing close on him or clogging the lane. If he truly is cash money from the 3 ( or even his mid range) russ, Lebron, and ad are going to fucking dominate in the paint. Throw in Dwight Howard and we got a fucking party just from hustle and rebounding alone"
Dwight Howard?
"yeah i mean you're comparing laimbeer to 3 of GOAT centers... hakeem olajuwon for example, even beyond his position, can be argued to be a top 5 player of all time. if bill laimbeer can make it as a starter in today's USA national team, then that says a lot about today's NBA. like you said, it especially speaks of the drought of US-big men in the NBA. their best big men are international players.  for sure a shortened offseason should be factored in, but the whole world faced complications against the pandemic. a lot of international players also play in the NBA, so it's an even handicap imo.  i watched the USA vs France game in 2019 (check it out if you haven't), and it seems like the common denominator is your last point.. most of them are ""superstars"" on their team and don't know how to really play team-ball as a consequence. their teams are structured in a way where the team revolves around them as a center piece. now all those players come together thinking they're the justice league, when really they're just confused on how to play together.  so yes, these players are individually athletically talented, more than previous generations. their talents, however, are capped- They lack the talent of being able to play on any team. Guys in previous Olympic teams knew how to play with each other, despite not being on the same team... and that talent is more important in team sports, like basketball. This isn't tennis.. sometimes basketball is like tennis, when you're playing 1-on-1. Too bad there isn't a 1-on-1 professional league watched by millions of viewers on television. These guys would excel at it.  the problem is, everyone wants to be ""jordan,"" yet even jordan wasn't the leading scorer of the dream team. he played his ROLE.. and they let charles barkley do most of the scoring because his body/strength/basketball ability was kryptonite for every other team. they all served their roles and no one tried to be a star, most of them never played with each other, but gel'd immediately. maybe it's just the culture that's in the states right now, everybody wants to be ""That guy,"" but the real ""that guy""s knew how to do it all, and that's what US kids aren't seeing. Even watching the Redeem Team.. man they were ferocious on the court and playing beautiful team ball. Kobe wasn't even the leading scorer, but again, like Jordan, he played his role.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm sure if the team consisted of Lebron/Steph/Klay/Durant/Draymond/Myles Turner/Dwight Howard/Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Kawhi Leonard.. they'd be beating everybody. First, 4 of them have played together on the same team. Second, LeBron can fit on any team because his game is like Magic Johnson's, he just fits on any team. Dwight Howard is old but he's tough now, plays bully bull on his limited minutes, and he played on the Redeem Team like LeBron. Myles Turner and Brook Lopez are the only American-born Centers who are better than all the other American Centers who have been in it for 5+ years. Myles Turner is a liability because he would've gotten destroyed by Gobert (see footage of Pacers vs Jazz games). It's sad that team USA would have to have him as a Center because he's young/has more stamina than Brook and Dwight, but doesn't have an aggressive rebounding nature against REAL centers. Rotate minutes. Jrue Holiday knows how to play proper defence and is a team player. Klay is one of the NBA's elite defenders. Kawhi, elite defender. If you had Jrue, Klay, Kawhi, Draymond, and Dwight Howard all on the floor at the same time.. It's gonna be a loooooong day for all the opposing teams.  &amp;#x200B;  finally, no disrespect to popovich, but these lineups have been questionable (even the plays ran in the 2019 game). i don't know if he's the right coach for this team"
"my point is if you put the players of this generation in the 80s, they‚Äôd be averaging what they do against good national teams in the olympics. FIBA style is much closer to previous NBA generation rules than this gen of NBA. Kobe &amp; T-Mac have an interview where they said if they were in their primes and playing in today‚Äôs NBA, they‚Äôd be scoring 45 points per game... and I can see why. They‚Äôd be getting to the freethrow line 25 times a game, and they‚Äôd have more spacing now to make shots than the more aggressive D they had to face back then.   they don‚Äôt have to face Ben Wallace, Ron Artest, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Tony Allen, Tyson Chandler, Marcus Camby, and etc in their primes. the 32+ year olds / vets in the NBA give the new guys a hard time in the playoffs especially during clutch situations. dwight howard and rondo, shells of their former selves, were important for the lakers‚Äô playoffs run last year, and you could see that a 35 year old PJ Tucker on the Rockets last year was playing tough against the Lakers.   Their shit usually doesn‚Äôt translate to the box score, but when you see them on the floor, you see the little things they do. They‚Äôre not as fast and strong as they used to be, but their IQ is still there, hence why they leave the scoring to the younger agile dudes who are still in their athletic primes."
"I feel like better American centers are young: Chet Holmgren, Evan Mobley, types. Myles Tuner, Dwight Howard l, Jarrett Allen, Bam, Plumlee I guess.   Definitely the weakest position for the U.S."
 &gt;who was the last great American big man  Dwight Howard
"You‚Äôre choosing his best season ever, 5 years ago to prop him up? Should i say dwight howard is a superstar?"
"fun fact: Last time the USA team played in this stadium in 2006, was the only time in history that a super talented USA team lost to more than 100 pts! from an NBA-less Greece team.   USA team roster: Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Gilbert Arenas, Carmelo Anthony, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard   http://www.fiba.basketball/basketballworldcup/2019/news/classic-games-greek-drama-ends-with-historic-win-over-usa-in-2006-world-cup-semi-final"
"Can I sell you on a gently Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, and Marc Gasol?"
Dwight Howard
Kyrie in Boston KD in OKC Lonzo Ball in LA Harden in Houston Dwight Howard in LA  That's my guess.
"gonna guess you watched the same wilt chamberlain archive stuff posted by dantheman that i have   there isn‚Äôt much of it, but i‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs like one video where Wilt beats everyone down the floor   1.	that‚Äôs not that uncommon. Dwight Howard was frequently the fastest and first dude down the floor. he was crazy fast, but not faster than Bron  2.	Wilt‚Äôs first step has noting on LeBron. LeBron‚Äôs is the best ever man. it‚Äôs why he scores 28 a game and he‚Äôs a passer first"
"Harrison Barnes is only 29, even his name sounds older. Also, feels like Dwight Howard is in the league for 30 years"
"He def didn't jump higher than Dwight in that era. Howard was a freak, ridiculous explosiveness. Lebron back then didn't even attack Dwight in the paint. Howard had the strength, length and elite vertical leap. Lebron def was top 5 fastest player coast to coast. Remember when even Miami Bron was trying to barrel through Carlos Boozer with all his might, and Boozer didn't barge?   But in terms of acceleration and first step, I would take a lot of guards and even wings like Carmelo over him. Melo had a quicker first step and a better second jump, kinda like what you see from Zion with the explosive first step and second jump."
I feel like its Dwight Howard tbh he was great
"Take the bionic leg of Lebron, the shoulders and delts of 2011 Dwight Howard, the arms and forearms of prime David Robinson, the motor and stamina of 80s Jordan, the IQ of Bill Russell with the speed and quickness of young Iverson."
"Being a legitimate journalist doesn't get you $12M a year contracts.  I'd say that Jordan is overrated, KD is stupid and that Dwight Howard is better than Shaq for $2M a year, let alone 12."
"I think the Celtics with Paul Pierce, KG, Ray Allen, and Rondo got me into basketball but Westbrook made me fall in love with the sport. His energy and ferociousness was just so entertaining and he‚Äôs been my favorite player since his rookie or sophomore year. Dwight Howard was my favorite player for a while but the OKC Thunder team with their big three was probably when the height of my NBA fandom began."
"They still got Jordan Poole. Iguodala will come back to Golden State too if Miami doesn't pick up his option for a trade. They won't be hard capped this year, and would be looked at as a serious contender after the Beal trade, so they will do better in going after minimum guys like Dwight Howard that could help out their depth."
"Cause a lot of people already said kawhi,  Pete maravich, Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard"
"Chris Paul, Dwight Howard come to mind"
"Kyle Anderson, Dwight Howard, TJ McConnell. Let‚Äôs be honest, you don‚Äôt even have to send stars. what other country has the players to match up?"
"Steve Nash, Dwight howard?"
"There are many stories about Wilt basically being able to use two other NBA centers as dumbells, waving other centers like a toy, guards trying to foul him just hanging on his body, unable to even change his trajectory. I don't think there is a comparison in current NBA, but talking about physicality, that's still more LeBron or Dwight Howard then Giannis."
We've seen with Dwight Howard that you dont have to be a horrible person to be difficult to be around
"There's videos of Dwight Howard draining like 20 threes in a row in the off-season, it just doesn't translate like that"
Ill take Dwight Howard hitting more 3s next year than Simmons
Remember when Dwight Howard and Candace Parker were a thing?  If they had a baby he/she'd have scouts by day 2 after birth
Lakers with Dwight Howard: Champion  Lakers without Dwight Howard: 1st round exit   Dwight howard &gt; AD  Really comparing Jae Crowder to CP3. This subreddit is a joke. Hilarious how other people who didnt watch the suns all season try to tell me who the best player was this season
"That was a bit hyperbole, there were a few years that like 2012 he was definitely towards the lower half of the bottom 10 for me.    Off the top of my head I rank Lebron, Durant, Westbrook, Curry, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Dwayne Wade easily over Melo in the majority of his prime years.  Other guys I would prefer includeChris Bosh, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzki, Paul George.  This tier is debatable, so I don‚Äôt really care either way."
Scariest shoulders: Dwight Howard
"What you‚Äôre describing is the most realistic option for the Lakers. We‚Äôd probably have to luck out with dudes taking a pay cut to have a fleshed out roster if we go for another big name kinda dude. One thing the Lakers are likely considering is that while LeBron is still amazing, he only has so many years left in his career so going big on risk is less unappealing given the circumstances. We‚Äôd definitely need to get someone like a Dwight Howard from 2020, on the minimum and totally bought in giving it his all."
Kg being injured wouldn't change the fact that dwight Howard and his cast of roided up sharpshooters were at a match up advantage against the celtics
Philly gonna bring back an all star. His name Dwight Howard
"The rules completely changed from the regular season in that series. Dwight Howard was given free-reign in the paint and brutalized everyone. The team was built to beat Boston and LA, not a behemoth of a center and the beginning of the 3 and D evolution  To answer your question, no replacing a DPOY 4/5 with a 3 would not have made the Bucks better"
Lol right?? Dwight Howard is a first ballot hall of famer and isn‚Äôt top 60 all time. Lebron is at WORST 3rd. There‚Äôs absolutely no justification for ANY WORSE than 3rd.
I don't believe you on the Dwight Howard stat
"They already capitalized. They did nothing. Giannis now begged on social to be an ambassador. Just send him $1000 in merch and gift cards and they‚Äôll triple down without having to spend tens of thousands on a sponsorship that ultimately will never live up to this piece of organic marketing.  Same thing happened with Wendy‚Äôs when Dwight Howard got his free milkshake after a game. Everyone loved the social post because of the context, but at the end of the day, no one is going to go to Wendy‚Äôs in 3 months because Dwight is sponsored by them and doing commercials"
"Unless you're a native for the team , there isn't really much reason to go watch em.   Last time I saw a player that isn't there to promote something is probably Dwight Howard in ECF in Atlanta stadium ."
They have a much better chance than Dwight Howard.
"Michael Jordan, Zach Lavine, Ray Allen, Stephon Marbury, Tyler Hansboro, Emeka Okafor, Mario Chalmers, Paul Pierce, Dwight Howard, Klay Thompson."
Missing Dwight Howard
Let's see now...  Wilt's vertical? Shaq's strength? Big? Fast? Durable? But not a basketball savant?  You just described Dwight Howard. This hypothetical player goes top 5 any and every draft he'd be in.
I can't believe Dwight Howard joining the Rockets is now 8 years ago.
&gt; 2011 very close MVP race with Rose winning it  It wasn't really close. Dwight Howard got 2nd place in the MVP voting and had 3 first place votes. D Rose had 113 first place votes. Only Lebron stans will try to tell you it was close even though Lebron wasn't even 2nd place.
"I feel like people look at the 2014 Rockets-Blazers series and assume Damian Lillard was the best player on the team for those games, but LaMarcus Aldridge was unstoppable at times against a still elite Dwight Howard. I think he deserves the recognition of getting the team to the conference semis."
LeBron was so good in 2009. One of the best playoff performances ever and it was wasted because Mike Brown thought it was smart for Big Z to guard Dwight Howard and Ben Wallace to chase Rashard Lewis around screens
"I think the Magic‚Äô retirement of #6 is stupid, to honor the ‚Äúsixth man‚Äù. They could have retired Penny Hardaway, Shaw, even Dwight Howard, but they retired #6 instead."
"KD is the only guy that clears the rest of the field when it comes to Harden teammates.  You forget that Dwight Howard, Josh Smith, and Corey Brewer saved his season. If Harden was that motherfucker he'd have shown us"
Dwight Howard/Andrew Bynum and whoever else was in the deal
He had Chris Paul  He had Russell Westbrook (twice)  He had Dwight Howard (who put in an All NBA season in a Rockets jersey)  He literally had KD before.  Nah. Harden's gotta show me
The Dwight Howard trade was awful for the lakers philly and Orlando
"The Iggy-Bynum-Howard trade. The magic ""won"" by getting Vuce but they've also been terrible since so ehh. Iggy left the Nuggets  two years later in fa. Dwight got injured and left.  Bynum got injured and left.  The funniest part is the magic received three protected 1st rounders (one didn't convey). They traded both picks"
I don't think anybody really won the Dwight Howard-LAL trade
Dwight Howard trade was pretty much a loss for everyone involved.
Ben Wallace is not a comparable to MVP runner up and 5x all-NBA first team player Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard
"2008 simply did not have the bigs to hang with 1992.  1992 could just run a simple Robinson and Ewing twin tower lineup and 2008 would have no chance.  Or even ""downgrade"" their size to Malone/Barkley.  That's 4 all-time elite post players there.  2008 had one good post defender - Dwight Howard - Boozer/Bosh aren't going to be able to stop those guys."
"Trading one for Asik is really the only one I had a problem with. He probably could have gotten him for a couple of seconds considering Houston had Dwight Howard. The other first round trades were for Jrue Holiday, Cousins, and Mirotic, and aside from Cousins's Achilles injury happening, all three would happen again."
Josh Smith used to eat breakfast with Dwight Howard when they were AAU teammates.
"‚ÄúYeah, he earned it. But fuck Dwight Howard‚Äù - Shaq basically"
"Yeah, as we all know he prefers guys like Dwight Howard and Andre Drummond, players notorious for their high bball IQ."
"Did you guys know Josh Smith and Dwight Howard played together in their AAU days? This offseason might be slow, I think."
"Let‚Äôs not forget he also played with HOFs Dwight Howard and Westbrook. 1-4 in his last 5 elimination games with the Rockets. 41% FG, 24% 3PFG, 27 TO‚ÄîHe quit on his team against the Spurs in 2017 and then just QUIT his team. Did you watch the the NBA finals? Giannis is 26 (Harden 26 in 2016). I‚Äôm not hating on him it‚Äôs just not a comparison anymore."
Is this man still talking about Dwight Howard?
Dwight Howard sat down to watch the Laker's celebration back when the Magic lost to them.  He even had Jameer Nelson sit down next to him to witness as well.  He wanted both of them to use it as motivation going into next year.
"Giannis is a Lankier, slimmer more fast prime Dwight Howard"
Dwight Howard is a free agent and would fill a need for the Suns.
Nah I read it. Perk can't guard him and Perk was also not an interior shot blocker so he would actually be quite useless.   He was really just a post defender who specialized defending guys like Dwight Howard/Yao. He defended Dwight well but not so much with Yao.
Dwight Howard will forget live rent free in Shaq head lol
Dwight Howard
Find someone who loves you the way Shaq hates Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard over dame what are you smoking?
I‚Äôd put Dwight Howard in at 8 or 9 (basically right around Westbrook).
Uh Dwight Howard is almost certainly over Dame and Melo
"Same here lol. Outside of the Warriors players, my mom only knows Giannis because I talk about him non stop. She also knows CP3 as the guy who frowns all the time and is mean to Steph. And Dwight Howard as the guy with the huge shoulders we saw in SFO one time  But then again she can also name the entire 90s Bulls and Knicks rosters because she used to watch a lot when we lived in Chicago but stopped watching after Jordan retired."
"This, you also can't fault him for only having one center available on the team. Someone like Dwight Howard on the bench would've been so useful for the Suns"
"2020 Lakers were a super team. Two top 10 players, good role players in Dwight Howard, Danny Green, KCP, Rondo, Carushow, and Kuzma (I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, he did what he needed to last year off the bench) then you still got guys like Morris, McGee who had some great games, and Avery Bradley who unfortunately couldn‚Äôt play in the playoffs. That‚Äôs a super team unless you consider needing a 3rd star to make it one"
he is too young to rank him.   for all we know he might fizzle out in the next few years not achieve anything worth mentioning for the rest of his career (see Dwight Howard for example).   if he continues to be the same he is now and can do it for another 6+ years he very well might end up as the 2nd best PF ever.
"Yeah, it's factual.  [Dwight Howard Signs with Rockets ](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/6/4497948/dwight-howard-houston-rockets-daryl-morey-nba-free-agency)  [Carmelo Anthony Signs with Rockets](https://www.nba.com/news/report-carmelo-anthony-sign-deal-houston-rockets-today)"
You‚Äôre counting Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony as Morey picks?
"Again, Dwight Howard is very much alive."
But the advanced analytics say that it‚Äôs actually Dwight Howard.
You forgot about Dwight Howard /s
Damn they putting a lot of money on the new developmental staff making Wiseman into Dwight Howard 2
"He might, might not, or he might leave later if he doesn't.  Westbrook made the finals at 23 and hasn't been back.  Dwight Howard, best center in the league at 23, made the finals at 23 and didn't return until being a back up at 34.  Gary Payton made one at 27 and didn't return until he was a ring chasing vet at 35 and 37. He had one ""everything clicks"" run in his prime.  George Gervin made the ECF once at 26 and never made it that far again. (lost game 7 by 2)  David Thompson made the WCF at 23 and retired by 29.  At 24 Carmelo led the Nuggets to the WCF, he has won exactly one other series since then."
&gt;It's only one Superman now and that's you.  giannis getting the approval dwight howard desperately wanted.
dwight howard crying
"He's everything I expected Dwight Howard to become on defense. Except when he came into the league, he was an immigrant came from poverty. Not a man child who's favorite movie was Finding Nemo (not even a joke, but a fact from the Orlando jumbotron during his rookie year)."
"Westbrook was 23 when he made his 1 and only finals.  Same for Dwight Howard as a star.  He's a contributor now, but it's not the same winning a title like that."
Dwight Howard won last year tho
He will have to pull a Dwight Howard &amp; swallow his ego and head to a contender for pennies.

I'd take DeAndre Jordan too because of that no basket interference rule from FIBA.  One reason Dwight Howard was unstoppable in Beijing 2008.
Roster construction is such an issue. Bring fucking Andre drumound or even Dwight Howard will help so much
That Dwight Howard guy was pretty good shooting 3s last time he was with the Lakers    Shot 60% during the season &amp; 50% during the playoffs    Could be a good 3 &amp; D guy
While being held back by Dwight Howard at that
Don‚Äôt hate any player but not a fan of Dwight Howard.
"Many centers nowadays aren't very skilled post players or even skilled scorers in general. Guys like Dwight Howard, Steven Adams, and Tristan Thompson aren't gonna back down OG or Siakam and score. Both of those guys are strong enough to hold their own if a bigger guy tries to back them down and many centers aren't skilled enough to finish over them.  Guys who would give Siakam and OG trouble at the 5 spot are big, skilled post players like Embiid, Jokic, Vucevic , and Valanciunas. So really, it depends on the matchup. If the 5 is just a rim runner and bad post player, Siakam and OG can defend them. If the 5 is someone who's bigger and stronger on top of being a skilled post player, Siakam and OG will have trouble."
"Is this a joke? Dwight Howard is an 8X All NBA, 5X All defensive, 3 Time DPOY, 5X Rebound Champ, Made it to the finals as the No.1 guy, won a chip as a supporting role, was seen as a top 3 center for 9 consecutive years and is a top 10 defensive plauer of all time. Yao Ming is a 5X All NBA and better shooter, thats it. There is no discussion"
"People have their opinion and then they look for reasons to back it up. They started at ""Yao is better"" so they look for reasons to explain their existing opinion. Yao's a top player in basketball history, so there's plenty to look at. It's not surprising they found an example where he was better than Dwight Howard in some way.  What I'm saying is that the 7-2 or whatever thing isn't meant to convince you, it's evidence to back up the opinion they already had."
"In no particular order and assuming that they keep the original 50.   Lebron James   Kobe Bryant   Tim Duncan   Steph Curry   Kevin Durant   Dirk Nowitzki   Kevin Garnett   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Kawhi Leonard   James Harden   Dwyane Wade   Chris Paul   Steve Nash   Jason Kidd   Russell Westbrook   Allen Iverson   Gary Payton   Paul Pierce   Dwight Howard   Tracy McGrady   Dominique Wilkins   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Damian Lillard   Bob MacAdoo"
"&gt; If you honestly think Dwight Howard was a better center, this isn't going to be a productive conversation.  LOL you're right.  Anyone who thinks Yao is a greater player than Dwight should just delete their account."
"&gt;Yao has literally 0 1st team all NBAs. The first 4 years of his career Shaq was still in or close to being in his prime. The last couple years Dwight was an MVP candidate and making deep playoff runs. This is just laughably false. Yao's ""prime"" was also 3 years and he played 58, 48, and 55 games those years.  If you honestly think Dwight Howard was a better center, this isn't going to be a productive conversation. Watch games where Dwight faced Yao. Yao shat on the multiple DPOY with style when they went head-to-head. Yao was without a doubt the best center after Shaq got old.  &gt;Again no. Never even finished top 10 in MVP voting.  Get off of basketball-reference.com please. Yao was one of the only players who demanded a double team at all times. He was one of the best players in the league during his prime.  &gt;Injuries are reality. Nobody has Brandon Roy on their list because his career was cut short due to injuries. Also Yao barely even had a prime because of injuries.  Brandon Roy was no Yao.  &gt;Yao has zero argument to be on this list. As I said, a guy like Lillard has already far surpassed Yao in every single possible way as a player and no one is trying to put him on the list.  Lillard and Yao are incomparable. Yao was the focal point of his team's offense and injuries are his ultimate downfall, not lack of ability. You can't say the same for Lillard."
Time to bring Dwight Howard back too
"He will have some big highlight plays sandwiched by turnovers, dropped passes and missed open layups. He has athleticism but no coordination to utilize it. His dunks and blocks occasionally look like Dwight Howard, but they come once every half dozen games, if that"
"He will have some big highlight plays sandwiched by turnovers, dropped passes and missed open layups. He has athleticism but no coordination to utilize it. His dunks and blocks occasionally look like Dwight Howard, but they come once every half dozen games, if that"
Dwight was looking for a starting minutes and our management wanted to pursue gasol first.   Dwight and javale played very little minutes during the bubble playoffs except for a good matchup for Howard against Houston  Gasol never really got his chance to shine with a healthy Lakers all last season and short playoff run.   Also Harrell was the reigning 6moy and took the MLE which was way less than what he could've got. Someone that talented you gotta take em. Doesn't fit and is a liability in the playoffs and we move on.  (Klutch sports client also)
"Karl Malone and Gary Payton signed as free agents for the minimums. There was no situation where the Lakers had a superior alternative choice. Asides from that Karl Malone carried this team in the playoffs. Without him, we would not have gone as far as we did and would have gone further if he didn't get injured.  Dwight Howard was swapped for Andrew Bynum, who immediately fell out of the league. Nash was swapped for a bunch of picks. I don't think there were superior alternatives to those two trades either."
"Steve Nash, Dwight Howard, Karl Malone"
Insert Dwight Howard Wizards quote
"Exactly; Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo were important parts of the playoffs in 2020, and they were relatively cheap.    The folks on the 2021 playoff team didn't pan out (Schroder most of all), but we'll have a different mix this time."
Preview of the rest of the lakers target list for this summer:  Markelle Fultz   Bismack biyombo  Dwight Howard  Elfrid payton  Josh jackson  Tony Allen  Ricky rubio
"I think at least with buyout guys they already got a good portion of the bag for the year already, and being on a good team also gives them a chance to shine like they wouldn't on a bad team and so it can end up with them getting a decent contract afterwards.  Basically, if Dwight Howard went somewhere other than the Lakers, where all he had to do was play defense off the bench and catch some lobs to look good, especially for his contract. He rehabilitated his value on the Lakers in a way he probably wouldn't have if he were the same player but playing a much bigger role on the Pistons, say.  For example, Kevin Love has \~60 mil left on his contract for the next two years. If he plays out his contract on the Cavs, with his role diminishing more and more, still weighing down their finances, he might not get another contract. If he plays this year, gets bought out next year for 15 Mil (including the salary already paid to him that year), then goes to the Nets on a minimum contract, hits some shots in the playoffs, and wins a ring, maybe the Kings sign him to 3yrs/15 Mil and not only does he come out slightly ahead, he gets to keep playing basketball (might also boost all-time career stats) and has another ring, which is only going to increase endorsement/TV analyst money in the future.  In the case of someone who hasn't already won a ring, if the money is going to be similar anyway for similar reasons, they've probably been dreaming of winning an NBA championship for most of their lives, and if they've just been bought out, why not go after it, if the likely alternative is that they'll never get another chance? As a player at least."
"It‚Äôs a huge win for performance but it‚Äôs not a great sign for the longevity of AD‚Äôs career.  The guy is not a Center. He‚Äôs a lanky guard that just happened to hit a massive growth spurt. This is why he‚Äôs had so many injuries in his early years with New Orleans. Massive human beings are bulldozing you on every play and little asshole orc guards are grabbing your arms and hanging all over your shoulders.  With the Lakers offensive lineup? It‚Äôs great because it allows them to add another wing/forward player that can shoot and switch on defense. The problem has always been that AD will without a doubt turn into mashed potatoes by season‚Äôs end playing Center full-time in the Western Conference. Guarding and rebounding against guys like Jokic, Gobert, Ayton, Nurkic, ect? It‚Äôs a tall-order for an already ‚Äúfrail‚Äù player.  The win-win is for the Lakers to pick up another player like Dwight Howard that they can plug-in for 20-25MPG during the regular season and allow AD to play PF during most of the game. You can then transition to ‚Äúsmall ball‚Äù in the fourth quarter and have AD play @ 5 for 8 minute stretches. That‚Äôs a huge difference between getting AD healthy to the post season or having to push him there in a wheel chair.  Playoff time? All hands on deck. AD @ 5 in favorable matchups all game."
"Danny Green was acquired by trade.Markieff Morris isn‚Äôt worth more then the minimum, Javale McGee has played on the minimum since 2015, he isn‚Äôt worth more either.  Dwight Howard was playing on the MLE on washington and was bad, he is also a minimum guy this year. Rondo made $9 million the year then Lakers won the championship. He wasn‚Äôt signed on the minimum.  Which of those players took less to play with the Lakers? They are all minimum guys expect Rondo who wasn‚Äôt paid the minimum.  How the fuck are you calling people casual when you are so clueless? I‚Äôm assuming the Lakers flair is just Lebron."
"The Dwight Howard Story, tonight on CNN"
Dwight Howard is busted and pushing 40 and still somehow has the best physique in the league. Super freak.
He compared Evan Mobley to Bill Russell and this dude to Dwight Howard. Lol.
Body type like Dwight Howard? Bitch is he gonna put on 80 pounds of muscle?!
DWIGHT HOWARD????
"I have a feeling you're a fan without having actual basketball knowledge...The main issues the Rockets faced last year in the bubble were that they, for whatever reason, got rid of Clint Capela and were left with no size or good enough shooters to play effective spaced-out small ball. It turned in to Harden and Westbrook trying to iso and either pass out to a 3, where they struggled, or drive into the lane with towering big men in AD, Dwight Howard, and JaVale McGee. Given that LA already stuggles with 3 point shooting and Howard and McGee are no longer there, I don't see them doing much better, especially if AD is continually dealing with injuries. LeBron isn't getting any younger either."
Don‚Äôt forget Dwight Howard and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
I never imagined Russ was going to go the Dwight Howard path and spend his 30s bouncing around so many teams.

"&gt; **2004:** Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West  Not only is this a terrible take, I would argue that Dwight had a better career than every other lottery pick combined. At least he has more All-NBA and All-Star selections than the rest of the lottery lol, maybe even than the whole draft."

"&gt;2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West  &gt;This is a draw, imo  &gt;2011: Kyrie Irving &lt; Jonas Valanciunus, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson   Bro what  &gt;2003: LeBron James &gt;&gt; Dwyane Wade, Marcus Banks, Brian Cook  &gt;The 5-13-24 formula fails here.  You don't say."
"&gt; 2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West  what the fuck"
"in what universe is having Harris, Telfair and West as good as Dwight fucking Howard?"
"Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West     You are on crack"
"How the hell is Dwight Howard a draw with Harris, Telfair, and West? I get no one likes him but Howard is a likely hall of famer."
"&gt; 2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West  &gt; This is a draw, imo  what the fuck lmao"
That's actually pretty nice. Add a 3&amp;D wing using the MLE to compete with Harris for the starting 3 spot/be the seventh guy in the rotation and and see if you get Dwight Howard on the vet min to be the starting C and that's a great group if healthy
"Hield + getting Dwight Howard back is the move they should be making. Resign Caruso, get DeRozan if he'll take a cheap contract, and fill out rest of the roster with shooters. Adding Westbrook is a high-risk, high-reward move and the Lakers don't need to be that desperate when they already have AD and Lebron."
"This is why I've hated flairs. This has nothing to do with me being a Clipper fan. This is about me thinking that the Lakers are making a stupid decision if they spend their entire cap on those 4 players. It's a high-risk, high-reward move. I think they would be better off trading for Hield, trying to get Dwight Howard back, resigning Caruso for the right price, and filling out the rest of the roster with the best shooters they can afford."
"One drew Gooden and one Aaron brooks for Dwight Howard and Shawn Marion. It‚Äôs a steal for you! Do you see Dwights free throw %?? And do you see how Marion shoots? LMAO, don‚Äôt lose out on this."
This is to weighted against players who have been in the league longer like Dwight Howard
The insane amount of times Mark Cuban pursued Dwight Howard after they won it all in 2011 I think.
"The 4 out offense with 1 elite rim protector / scorer started in the 90s with Hakeem and saw utility again with the Van Gundy Magic.  Now 4+1 is the standard rather than 3+2 and more teams are going to a 5+0.  This may ultimately be a step towards ""solving"" basketball, meaning talent being equal, 5+0 &gt; 4+1 &gt; 3+2.  That isn't to say Zion Williamson can't thrive in the league.  At this point, it seems bigs are either only as valuable as the playmaker they are playing with - elite offensive engines are generating their looks (lebron &amp; dwight howard, trae young/harden &amp; clint capela) or have the ability to be a high efficiency offensive engine with gravity / playmaking (embiid / jokic).  Gobert is an example of the former and without Conley his offensive value tanked.  He lost the yin to his yang.  The Jazz tried to adjust their scheme by playing more iso heavy basketball.  I know people love Mitchell, but he just isn't efficient enough in isolation to make up for his lack of playmaking and I don't think they can win with him running the offense.  Overall, I think Gobert loses some defensive value in a true 5-0 and he loses some offensive value w/o a true playmaker."
"If Dwight Howard didn't listen to Shaq, demand a bunch of inefficient (for him and the league in general at that point) post touches, and he instead just embraced his insane stats as a roll man he could have had a much different career (a ring or two before LA)"
"Basketball Reference probably isn't perfect, but their model estimates a 99.73% chance that Dwight Howard makes the Hall of Fame."
I got downvoted to shit the other day for saying Dwight Howard was a hall of famer (the audacity!): Couldn‚Äôt believe the shit I got for that. Not a Howard fan but not really not debatable.
"Seriously, I compare his speed to young Dwight Howard."
"Three teams got robbed in the Dwight Howard trade, and the inexplicable winners were the Orlando Magic.  Dwight's (first) time in LA was marred by injury and dysfunction, the superteam the Lakers attempted to form by adding Dwight and Steve Nash to their pre-existing core of Kobe, Gasol and Artest was a spectacular failure.  Andrew Bynum's time in Philadelphia was somehow even worse, his career absolutely cratered coming off an All Star season with the Lakers, which in retrospect hardly seems like it ever actually happened.  The most notable thing Andre Iguodala did in Denver was leave for Golden State.  That leaves the Magic, who traded away Dwight at his peak, mostly mismanaged the assets they received in that deal, but still managed to come out of it with Nic Vucevic, who turned out to be best player in the deal in the years that followed, and was often the only bright spot in Orlando until they traded him to the Bulls last year."
"&gt;Give me your tired, your poor...  Think I have seen that on the Statue of Lebirty.  But, seriously, the vets on Bron's team seem to rise up and perform when needed. Look at Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo's performance last year.  As long as your team is good enough drag them to the playoffs, they will start showing up."
"The 2012 team was way better than the 2021 team, but it def wasn't 100% full strength for the time. No Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Rajon Rondo. Blake Griffen was coming off of a great year too, but the put AD on the team instead even though he hadn't even played in the NBA yet"
"dwight howards tweet  is up there too  &gt; @uHateBre with that face ion think u getting one either lol.  &gt; ‚Äî Dwight Howard (@DwightHoward) August 7, 2013  https://i.imgur.com/uZFW9VH.png"
"these young bucks don't know. You gotta remember a lot of these NBA players aren't even old enough to drink when they get in the league; they're still babies. They've been coddled their entire life, all through school and college, and now they get out in the real world with a pocket full of cash and every type of girl you could imagine trying to pull your sweatpants off. See, before you got that contract, while you were in school, you were just a prospect. You probably got a lot of attention from women, but your success wasn't a guarantee. Once you start pulling in them bucks, the type of women you encounter drastically change. Straight up jaw droppers wherever you turn. That's not an accident.  These kids don't understand that once you're in the real world, sex becomes a business move, for both parties. Even for us mortals, money is a big factor in your sex life. I don't care who you are, you know that shit is important. (Protip from Uncle Snuggie: if you got money, just don't fuck broke bitches. Just don't, change your phone number if you have to. Move to the other side of the country to somewhere broke bitches cant afford to go. They will ruin everything I don't care how pretty they are get a bitch with some capital. That's real shit. Get a Kim Kardashian. She stupid and probably can't read but she got money and won't take that much from you in divorce proceedings because of that. Be with someone who can throw in the pot too.)  The Dwight Howard's of the world don't understand that there's a price tag hanging off his nutsack. Dwight Howard is easily shelling out 6 figures a year per baby mama. (The fuck you need 100k a year to raise a baby? I could raise my whole hood 6 times with that kind of paper all babies need is somethin to rattle and someone to wipe they ass) That's more money than most of us will ever make in our lives, even those of us with professional and graduate degrees. 18 years, 18 years, she got one of yo kids, got you for 18 years.  I think every citizen, NBA or not, should know how divorce/family laws work, especially if you ever fuck around and get paid. You find out how much Uncle Sam will take out of your pocket cause you wanted to fuck raw and it'll turn you into a nun; keep your dick on a leash kid.  When you're young and naive if you believe in shit like the purity of ""love"" and all that other liberal hippie crap Disney shoves down your throat as a child you can fall victim to a big butt and a smile quite easily.  That's real shit"
Cuban rejected Giannis for extra cap space to chase Dwight Howard. We got Shane Larkin so there is that lol.
"Morey hasn‚Äôt had a great start in Philly?  He got rid of Horford, traded for Curry, and signed Dwight Howard and I believe Danny Green as well.  Seems like a pretty solid GM for having been there less than a year no?"
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù aren‚Äôt better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you‚Äôre obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
"they are just different.    Buddy hasn't proven to be a winning player in the NBA.  He is very streaky and kings fans will tell you he's god awful on D.     DG started for Raptors and Lakers on championships; and was key for us.  He has his own drawbacks, age and doing some of the dumbest shit you've seen this side of Dwight Howard on a court.   But he doesn't need the ball, will do the dirty work and can cover 2-4 and all of that is very valuable to a contending team.   Plus Buddy is owed 60 million over the next 3 years."
&gt;olympic village is an incredible experience with a full on festival vibe every time.  they can party there if they want to. but they can go to bed separated from their neighbors by more than a piece of parchment paper. you think dwight howard and demarcus cousins are about to take synchronized dumps on [these](https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/BqyweTrXNLKWE10WWkouNTCdkQ8=/800x652/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WNQP7Y3KKGBQY3RS54SMPMEIM.jpg)? come on now..
I mean Dwight Howard was the sixers back up this year so the recency makes that less shocking to me
Dwight Howard
"John Wall -- missing prime years severely hurt his stock, because he was a stellar player  Dwight Howard -- almost everything about his run as part of the Magic has been forgotten  Tony Parker -- he was always productive, but, hardly ever in talks with the premier PGs of his time  Reggie Miller -- since he's been passed in the record books, he's overlooked for how good of a player he was in his time. Incredible longevity too  Patrick Ewing -- he was a hell of a player, but, lacked championship gold"
Only moment I can think of that was worse on this sub was the Dwight Howard debacle. This sub got real ugly over the idea that a basketball player was dating a trans woman.
Give me motion or give me CP3 fouling out on that bullshit step on the brakes in front of Dwight Howard cause that seems like the logical thing to do.
"Jesus, the rockets started Capela AND Dwight Howard‚Ä¶"
Look at Dwight Howard as a rookie
Pg - Lowry.      Sg - Beal.       Sf - Lebron.      Pf - AD.         C - Dwight Howard.          I can totally fuck with this lineup.
"kobe dunking on rookie dwight howard  you could also do your entire research on ai alone - he really signified the post jordan era of nba basketball, everyone wanted a piece of him and he just embarrassed players left and right."
these dwight howard jokes are not it
"&gt;""Fuck them kids"" - Karl Malone  -Dwight Howard"
"It was against the raptors.   Kobe posterized Dwight Howard, thats probably what you‚Äôre thinking of because it was way more likely to make a slam poster. The AI dunk is pretty lowkey whereas the Kobe dunk is one of the all-time-famous posters."
"What make this point very stupid is that all those players were criticized for being washed. That‚Äôs a list of washed up players, this post literally means that lebron is washed. People were mocking 42 year old vice Carter, they literally do the same for all lebron‚Äôs mates.   Cp3 - washed  Dwight Howard- washed   Rondo- washed  Cousins- washed   Carmelo- washed   Age has never been a diminishing factor in being referred to as washed, it‚Äôs been the main identifying factor.   Imagine someone making a post like this for cleavland Shaq, this isn‚Äôt a counter argument, it‚Äôs exactly they are saying.   *Shaq is washed up*  What do you mean?? Look at all these other horrible players at a similar age.   Lebron can‚Äôt lead a team without a competent second or first option, but he is still trying to (not by his own fault). That‚Äôs the situation right now. His is in almost the same situation Kobe was in towards the end.  Note: I‚Äôm not saying any of these players are washed, but they are far from their peak, as they should be."
Hawks getting Dwight Howard would‚Äôve been incredible
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
"From 1990-2019 * Shaq * Chris Webber * AI * Tim Duncan * LeBron * Dwight Howard * Derrick Rose * Blake Griffin * Kyrie Irving * AD * 2 of KAT, Simmons, Edwards, Zion will get there  So about 12/30 = 40% chance. If you want to be more conservative and count out Kyrie and say only 1 of Zion, KAT, Simmons, Edwards will get there still 33%. Thing is though Cade is much more hyped than your average 1st overall pick. The only players that I think match the hype in the last 10 or so years are Zion, Simmons, and AD. I‚Äôd give him a 2/3 shot of being top 10 at some point in his career."
"It's whatever. My 2 favorite players aren't even americans anymore. Fuck the USA if they just gonna play like a bunch of pansies and bring guys like JaVale McGee lmfao Dwight Howard would have been a better pick over that fucking guy. I'm really disappointed that Serbia and Greece aren't there though...oh well, there's still France, Slovenia, and Australia to root for."
"yea around there. he got to the finals and got and mvp and everyone wouldn't shut up about him. he was definitely considered one of if not the best player for a time around then. he was so heavily praised at the time for more than just his dunk competition performances that is for damn sure. and was pretty much always put in the conversation for best active player at the time.  i don't even like dwight howard, and people got me defending him."
"This is what happens when you're a sharp shooter who played with prime Dwight Howard, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and Joel Embiid"
TIL dwight howard and rafer alston are as good as the KD warriors
"Morey got rid of the Al Horford contract after 1 season and traded Josh Richardson for 3 years of prime Seth Curry. He also acquired Harden in Houston in the first place. And Chris Paul. And Dwight Howard. And Russell Westbrook. Sure Harden and CP3 were the reasons the team challenged that KD-era Warriors, but Morey built it."
Dwight Howard belongs on here somewhere
I think stars can take on more specialized roles and be successful for a long time. I think the bigger problem is stars not being happy taking on drastically reduced roles/minutes. Dwight Howard I think is a good example of how a player can rework their role later in their career and continue to find success. Allen Iverson is an example of a star that couldn‚Äôt.
They'll completely ignore his near 38/9/10 on 62/50/90 shooting in game 2 where they lost by 1 and how he singlehandledly got them their only win with a 45/9/5 performance on 59/64/92 shooting  But you know Harden is a playoff choker cause he didn't beat a 67 win team with the reigning MVP and 2 all stars with past his prime Dwight Howard and Josh Smith
&gt; who was the last great American big man   Dwight Howard during his prime. Shaq if we're being strict with the meaning of great.
"Yeah everyone‚Äôs gonna say that because it‚Äôs CP3 but imagine if it was anyone else.  If during any stoppage of play, Dwight Howard could just grab Dame and keep him from talking to his coach or something"
Get him and Dwight Howard together for some shoulder growth mentoring
US could add Lopez and Dwight Howard in international play they could hold up agains those 2 down low. Not stop them by any means but wouldn‚Äôt be dominated with the likes of Bam and Draymond
Dwight Howard - Nets
Dwight Howard
Hawks legend Dwight Howard wore 12 for the Magic.
Dwight Howard could‚Äôve owned Gobert imo
"And Dwight Howard during his definitely first, only, and long-tenured stint as a Laker."
I say this as a lifelong Laker fan: fuck Dwight Howard.

Lebron when he went to Miami probably.   Over their career? Dwight Howard
"&gt; I think he's ready for this next time around to do whatever is necessary to help this team be successful, and I think he'll do it  [Kobe in 2019](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2853191-kobe-bryant-thinks-dwight-howard-will-do-whatever-is-necessary-to-help-lakers)  Also they met [again before he died.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnd2EDtCXhw)  Here's a story Jeanie Buss relayed where [Kobe's advice was to sign Dwight.](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/5/22/21268164/jeanie-buss-says-kobe-bryant-told-lakers-they-should-sign-dwight-howard-free-agency-phil-jackson)  Kobe and Dwight didn't hate each other, but refer back to my original comment where Dwight laments about not being able understand each other better, they certainly had some beef. In the end they settled it."
"You think that's good efficiency? In 2021, Dwight Howard got 18 techs on 17 min per game"
"He basically admitted that he is a ‚Äúfantasy owners player‚Äù because he is willing to elbow teammates that ‚Äústeal‚Äù his rebounds. He is your definition of empty stats. He has ultra low bbiq, no touch, just a big body. He has less post moves than Dwight Howard."
"&gt; A lot of people thought me and Kobe hated each other and stuff like that,"" Howard said at the time.

"&gt; Deng is getting more money than Melo and Dwight combined.  This bit is NOT true.  &gt;  the Lakers will pay Luol Deng more than Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard combined  True.

"My point was more - why did Philly do this. It was probably the best chance for Drummond to play on a contender, so I think that‚Äôs why he took the offer. But an 82 game season is a long time for a former All Star to be sitting there playing 12 mins a game. Particularly for one like Drummond. Who knows. I just don‚Äôt see him as this veteran version of Dwight Howard who comes in and gives you energy, blocks shots and makes himself a nuisance to deal with if you‚Äôre the opposition. Time will tell."
"Harden would not win at all with Middleton &amp; Jrue.

Dude's been playing with great players his whole career, started with Russ &amp; KD, had Dwight, CP3, Russ again, &amp; now Kyrie &amp; KD. Instead of saying ""give Harden Middleton &amp; Jrue,"" you should say give Giannis any of the teammates Harden has had &amp; maybe he would've won one sooner. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lol  Also, Giannis is better than Harden.

"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
"Players who are better per 100 possessions than Evan Fournier out of the min players on the Lakers roster. Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kendrick Nunn, Dwight Howard (arguably), and Wayne Ellington. Like his raw stats are better, but he isn't actually more efficient with the possessions he gets than pretty much any of them. He just has a larger role than any of them."
He's basically Dwight Howard when it comes to shooting. Do you expect anyone to improve Dwight's shooting?
"Not for lack of trying though. They tried to bring in CP3, Stern told 'em to fuck off. Tried to bring in Nash, but forgot he was older than Kobe. Tried to bring in Howard, but he was Dwight Howard. And tried to bring in Jeremy Lin, but forgot they were trying to take the ball from Kobe."
"Dwight Howard, population embellisher, looks forward to a reunion with former teammate and young socialite, Ben Simmons, in this week's marquee matchup"
Following dwight howard footsteps
Im not saying its a bad city. Its a small market team that has never won anything. And who has Atlanta ever signed? Dwight Howard might be the biggest star that has gone there.
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
"Yes, he became a better shooter than Curry, with the defense of prime Dwight Howard, with the handle of Kyrie, and the passing of Steve Nash. He also grew a foot taller when he got a tech"
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  ‚Äú The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.‚Äù"
Dwight Howard is a career 100% 3 point shooter in the NBA Finals.
Dwight Howard shot like 90% from the FT line in practice
I'd love to see the evolution of 3pt sniper Dwight Howard.  That would be cool as fuck
"&gt; was he better than Lebron, Kobe, KG, Nowitzki, Duncan during those years?  KG had a career-altering injury midway through 2009 that dropped him firmly below Dwight. Dwight was clearly better than Duncan from 2009 onwards (until 2012 or 2013, when it flipped again). Dwight was better than Kobe in 2011 and 2012 before his injury.  &gt; And the later ones KD and Rose too  Howard was always better than Rose (Rose won MVP on his team record, not being better), and KD only passed Dwight in 2012"
"OP thinks big names equal a super team lol.   Oh shit, lakers have Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard!!! (Goes on to ignore both players are near the end of their careers).   OP probably thinks 2004 Lakers were a super team because they had a washed up Malone and Payton."
Luka got clamped on the three point line by Gobert? And passed a game winner opportunity? And Batum blocked a shot on the run like he's Dwight Howard in 2009?
dwight howard can clamp down the rim at a very high level. drummond offers nothing in defense.
"If D Rose didn‚Äôt win in 2011, it wasn‚Äôt going to be lebron, Dwight Howard more likely. You can‚Äôt take 2018 from harden"
Nope but the 36-40ers would be an elite defensive group   36 Marcus smart 37 MetaWorld Peace  38 kwayne brown  39 Dwight Howard 40 Shawn Kemp
"You think that‚Äôs better than Carmelo Anthony, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard where have you been dude"
"Well other than Bam, USA's options at center are... Brook Lopez? JaVale McGee? Dwight Howard? It's rough. At least Bam is pretty athletic and can defend the P&amp;R decently."
Dwight Howard
"RJ- ""LeBron didn't have as much help as MJ""  MJs Teammates:  Scottie Pippen 17.7 ppg 7x all star Dennis Rodman 5.2 ppg 15.3 rpg 2x all star Horace Grant 12.6 ppg 1x all star Steve Kerr 8.2 ppg Toni Kukoc 14.1 ppg  LBJs Teammates: Dwyane Wade 22.7 ppg 13x all star Anthony Davis 23.9 ppg 8.6 rpg 8x all star Kyrie Irving 21.6 ppg 6x all star Chris Bosh 18 ppg 11x all star Ray Allen 10.3 ppg 10x all star Zydrunas Ilgauskas 13.8 ppg 2x all star  Honorable mentions because these guys were important pieces on championship teams: JR Smith, Kyle Korver, Rajon Rando, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Howard"
"Except that‚Äôs not what they averaged lol.  Just look at the names that season hmmm  A: Tim Duncan, Yao Ming, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh, Amare Stoudemire  B: Antawn Jamison, Carlos Boozer, Al Jefferson, David West  All averaged better stats than gasol on their first trip to the finals.  Don‚Äôt be silly man that era big men WERE very IMPORTANT.  You could argue too 10 big during that stretch but top 5, nah; not to me."
I mean they basically swapped George Hill and Dwight Howard for Drummond and Niang so they pretty much stayed the exact same
"Dwight Howard , you can go to r/Lakers for real answer though"
"He isn‚Äôt a superstar but back then there was almost no superstar big man other than Dwight Howard. Pau and Bynum were both top 5 big man at that time, who both average 20-10 and 2 blocks. Let‚Äôs be real here."
"Agree. But then people will say ""Mo Williams and big Z was trash as the second best player""or whatever.  But the Magic had Dwight Howard who we can all agree wasn't as good as LeBron and his second best player was ummm Hedo Turkoglo or old Rashad Lewis?  People act like every team in the NBA during that time had multiple All stars throughout the roster.  They lost in the playoffs and really I think it had more to do with Mike Brown getting out coached then anything.   But but but Boston Celtics. Yea they went 7 games with the HAWKS in the first round and the Cavs were still favorites over them. Hell the Cavs beat them by 20 in one of those games and LeBron only had 21 pts, but people will have you believing LeBron was dropping 40pts every game that series. That went 7 games btw. I get it 20/20 hindsight.   I feel like people compares those Cavs rosters to LeBron's heat teams and the big three warriors, which is why they will call everyone on the roster outside LeBron a scrub."
"I liked this thing the OP said about Westbrook:  &gt; Figure out a way to point his aggressiveness in the right direction and good things can happen  I'm *really* hoping that is true. I think Westbrook would be an incredibly helpful player if he focused on moving without the ball (namely on cuts to the basket), and funneled his energy most into defense and rebounds rather than scoring. Now he's shown absolutely zero interest in doing that so far in his career, but I'm really hoping that the Lakers can get him to move in that direction.   I think the Lakers could have a couple things going for them in their quest to get Westbrook to play smarter basketball by being a role player, beyond just Vogel and LeBron telling him to. I think that having both Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard there are two guys who once were players who have successfully changed their games to become productive role players once they were no longer stars, and I'm hopeful that maybe they can talk Westbrook into making the changes needed to play championship basketball. On top of that, this is the first time in his career where he'll clearly be the third best player on a team.  Of course, Westbrook strikes me as the most stubborn player the league has seen since Kobe retired (which can be both good and bad for a player), so maybe I'm just being hopelessly naive. Guess we'll see."
Dwight Howard might
"As opposed to getting the corpse of Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Trevor ariza...."
LMAO. I'm pretty sure Dame would have already asked for a trade if Portland acquired guys like Westbrook and Dwight Howard.
"Washed players I'm talking about are Melo, Aldridge, Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin."
[https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-rumors-dwight-howard-lakers-reunion-inevitable](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-rumors-dwight-howard-lakers-reunion-inevitable)     My guy. I am 100% sure that is how it went down.
"This is the hardest part to me..  in theory Andre Drummond is a good player looking at SOME stats, but then you watch him and it‚Äôs painfully obvious he is not a winning player and probably never will be because his only high level skill he has is hoarding rebounds (which the sixers actually already do pretty well) and things fall apart.  We needed a backup who could protect the rim and space the floor for Simmons when Embiid is out and we got neither.  I would of rather taken a chance on really anybody else but we‚Äôll see.  I had a similar opinion of Dwight Howard last year and he was actually pretty good for the most part.  I also know Andre Drummond is no Dwight Howard even üòÇüòÇ"
"Some guys here said Melo had no place in the NBA no more  2019 people say LeBron was a liability in defense. Last year before the injury he was one of the best defenders in the league  Dwight Howard is a locker room cancer  KD is coming back at 60% of himself. May be 80% if he's extremely happy  James Harden is the worst superstar defender because he doesn't care (advanced stats shows he's a very good defender, even at the post)  Giannis can't win a ring because he's a liability in the playoffs against the walls because he can't shoot  Jaylen Brown doesn't deserve that contract.  Trae Young can't succeed yet in playoffs  Chris Paul's contract is a liability for an injury prone old, undersized player"
"&gt; were saying he cant be an elite #3?   Just because someone was a #1 or #2 before doesn't mean they'll be an elite #3. Not everything works out as smoothly as the Big 3 in BOS, where Ray Allen is content to just play off-ball and shoot jumpers all game.   Just in Lakers history you can see the proof.   Glen Rice was a #1 in CHA (27ppg in 1997) that was brought in to be a #3 behind Shaq and Kobe. He does ok in that role in 99, but falls off in 2000. In the 2000 playoffs he averages only 12ppg (though Shaq and Kobe are enough to win the title anyways).   So the Lakers bring in Mitch Richmond, another long-time #1. He goes from averaging 16ppg in WAS to 4 as a Laker. While Shaq and Kobe are enough to win again without a #3, Richmond sees fewer playoff minutes than Slava or Mark Madsen.   Karl Malone and Gary Payton each averaged 20+ppg the seasons before they became Lakers, to be the 3rd-4th option behind Shaq and Kobe. Everyone knows how that panned out.   Dwight Howard was a successful #1 in ORL, a perennial MVP candidate who led his team to a Finals. He was brought in to be the #3 behind Kobe and Pau. Another not-so-pretty result."
"&gt;But for at least 30 mins a game. You have Lebron(average 3 point shooter), any guard(fanatic 3 point shooter) Westbrook( below average three point shooter) AD( below average three point shooter) and Dwight Howard( will not look to shoot).  Do you think they're going to play those 4 together for 30 minutes a game?   My bet is they'll actually start Westbrook, Ellington/Monk, Bron, AD, and Gasol. Gasol won't play long, but I doubt Westbrook, Lebron, Dwight, and AD get much time together at all. They'll be staggering lineups so at least 2 quality shooters on the floor at any point most likely, because they actually have the personnel for it now."
"J-Lin once interviewed Dwight Howard and Steph and Steph once said that ""I don't think even I can say *that* word."" *That* word being the N-word. Steph tries have as little controversy as possible, so that the most controversial thing about him is his foot fetish."
"Lakers still don‚Äôt have shooting. Hear me out. Yes they have Bench shooting. But for at least 30 mins a game. You have Lebron(average 3 point shooter), any guard(fanatic 3 point shooter) Westbrook( below average three point shooter) AD( below average three point shooter) and Dwight Howard( will not look to shoot). Yes they have gasol who will take up some center mins but the starting lineup looks awful, in terms of shooting"
"People forget we had Dwight Howard for a year, but yeah, Al was still better."
"When you account for the modern factors like rules, nutrition, fitness, and support staff, I think you‚Äôd be better off thinking of Bill Russell as being at least what people thought Dwight Howard could be."
This is one of the stupidest takes I've seen on Reddit. Do you really think Dwight Howard came back to NOT be the 3rd option?
"Credit to Melo too. Like Dwight Howard, he was finally able to accept and then thrive in the inevitable bench role at this stage in his career. No one thought Melo couldn‚Äôt play, they just thought he couldn‚Äôt play a supporting role on a team and he finally proved that to be false"
"Lakers signed a mEmE tEaM for 2019-2020. Especially regarding Dwight Howard, who had a a great year."
Maybe Dwight Howard
Yeah well Dwight Howard only took 3 days to beat battle toads. It took you 3.5 years. Checkmate.
‚ÄúDwight Howard isnt gonna be a 23/12 guy anymore‚Äù‚Ä¶.no shit
Dwight Howard over here signing high school yearbooks
Dwight Howard
Don‚Äôt forget Dwight Howard
"What a casual take. The recency bias is strong.     2 championships, 3 straight Finals appearances, Pau Gasol, and Dwight Howard (yes it didn‚Äôt end up working out). Damn near every GM would take that in a heartbeat during their tenure).    edit: forgot to mention the vetoed CP3 trade"
"&gt;That expansion team had Oscar Robinson a top twenty player ever.  Yeah, and he was many years past his prime.  And they had almost nothing else.  &gt;I will have to take your word for it was not there in 71, there are not many better defenders the Dwight Howard so who are you thinking there?  Chamberlain, Walton, Thurmond, Lanier, Malone, Gilmore... 20 years of guys tried.  The problem for Howard would be that he's just too small.  Prime Abdul-Jabbar is a match for him athletically, and around 4 or 5 inches taller, with longer arms.  &gt;I mean Gasol can hit threes so might not be the best option  Now, yeah, but he barely even attempted one until he was 32.  And that version is getting absolutely torched on the defensive end.  If I'm coaching in this game, I do not care in the slightest if Gasol makes 1.5 threes -- his career high -- because McAdoo is scoring 40 on him, or Abdul-Jabbar is hanging 50.  &gt;This ignores the AD of it all as well, which is another all time great defender to throw at them.  You could get Davis to cover McAdoo, and he's well-suited to that... but good luck trying to get Davis to guard Abdul-Jabbar.  He's too small, and worse, refuses to play that position.  &gt;Prime Lebron is 2013 and Cooper is 4 inches and 100 pounds away there‚Äôs nothing he can do there.  James did not weigh 270 pounds in 2013.  And what Cooper would do is stay in James' jersey on the perimeter -- like he used to do with Bird, driving him to distraction -- and weight doesn't matter there.  So James would have to post him up, but then he'd have to deal with getting his shots over or around a free-lancing Abdul-Jabbar, which is next to impossible.  Abdul-Jabbar held entire playoff teams to 40% shooting in his prime.  &gt;Norm Nixon and Byron Scott can‚Äôt stay in front of Russ they just can‚Äôt,  Sure they could, they'd give him 6 feet of space, and let him shoot jumpers if he wants.  &gt; Magic won‚Äôt be able to guard Anthony in the slightest.  Johnson led the league in steals, twice, and his defense is wildly underrated.  He's also one of the smartest basketball players ever, so he'd just slack off Anthony and invite him to launch from distance... at his career 48% effective rate or even his peak 51%.  For that matter, depending on the ruleset used, I would be inclined just to zone up your team of James, Westbrook, Anthony, Davis and Howard or Gasol.  I'm begging that team to shoot from outside, because they are all poor shooters except James, and even his career number is mediocre.  &gt;Shaq and Karl Malone are the match of McADoo and Kareem, Gary Payton can guard Magic and Cooper couldn‚Äôt do much agonist Kobe  Cooper is about as well-equipped as any human to guard Bryant.  No, he couldn't stop him from shooting, no one ever could, including O'Neal.  But he'd force him to take hard shots, which is exactly what you want to do with Bryant, because he'll take them all game long, and miss most of them.  Payton tried to guard a healthy Johnson a couple times -- and got torched for 33 points each time, with 9 and 11 assists.  Johnson shot 12 for 14, and 11 for 14 against him in those games."
boy was out there looking like prime dwight howard. devolved into a bum after he got clowned by shorty from icarly. shit crazy
"You must be new to draft season, you can find videos of Ben Simmons and Dwight Howard knocking down open 3s. Mo Bamba supposedly was knocking down 3s with a new shot effortlessly in open gyms"
"That expansion team had Oscar Robinson a top twenty player ever.   I will have to take your word for it was not there in 71, there are not many better defenders the Dwight Howard so who are you thinking there?

Norm Nixon and Byron Scott can‚Äôt stay in front of Russ they just can‚Äôt, Magic won‚Äôt be able to guard Anthony in the slightest.  The back court vs the front court is this game and that‚Äôs what makes it close I just think 21 edges it.  And interestingly enough I think the 04 Lakers match up better than the 21 Lakers agandit 83  Shaq and Karl Malone are the match of McADoo and Kareem, Gary Payton can guard Magic and Cooper couldn‚Äôt do much agonist Kobe"
You‚Äôll be crying for Dwight Howard to come back
"&gt;It was only 9-10 months ago the Lakers won the championship and the only guys remaining from that squad are LeBron, AD, THT, and Dwight Howard.   Not only that, but there are Lakers who were not yet on the team in October 2020, who are already gone ( or likely to be, any moment now ).  Harrell has already come and gone.  Schroder probably will too.  McLemore has come and gone.  McKinnie has come and gone.  Drummond might.  And hopefully we'll never see Wesley Matthews playing for the the Lakers again.  That's a half a roster that didn't win the title, already gone.  &gt;A lot of roster turnover for a proven team  You could say that."
"If this is *just* on paper, and *just* based on as the rosters stand right now... Put the Bulls above the 76ers. Ben Simmons - who has been openly called shit by one of their rookies *post-draft*, who was blamed for the series lowkey by the coach, Embiid, and booed mercilessly - is still on the team. They lost Dwight Howard and gained Andre Drummond. As it stands right now, I'd go with the Bulls. Ben Simmons will score on his own team until they pull him from the game."
"Sports training and recovery is different in this era and they can extend their careers a bit farther.  But on top of that, Russ is 32yo and GP was 35yo when he joined the Lakers.  Malone was a 40yo starter in a much more physically demanding and tougher era and his backup was 42yo Horace Grant.   Carmelo will be a 37yo floor spacer off the bench behind Anthony Davis in his prime.   Marc Gasol is 36yo and Dwight Howard is 35yo.  It would be more comparable if that GP+Karl Malone team had been a thing when they still had a last leg of their athleticism left."
It kicked me hard that Dwight Howard has more career points than Steph Curry
I mean honestly we'll see. Howard was useless in the playoffs anywyas. Drummond being a full time backup is a new role for him.  I'm not saying that the signing was an upgrade just saying the reaction on here is way overboard for swapping one garbage backup center on the vet min for another. Dwight on the Sixers was not nearly as good as the dwight the year before that the sub keeps focusing on
Also the greatest defensive player to never win DPOY. Just happened to be smack dab in the middle of Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard winning 7 of them in a 10 year span.
https://youtu.be/Q20_eIvvXXg  white dude who blocked Dwight Howard as a rookie. He's also a ridiculous rebounder for a guard. So good I want him in the starting lineup at times solely to make up for Jaren Jackson Jr
"Imagine a Lakers-Nets final next year featuring LeBron, AD, Westbrook, KD, Harden, and Kyrie.   Can throw in Gasol, Melo, Blake Griffin, and Dwight Howard for name value too.   What a star-studded matchup that would be. Storylines everywhere."
John konchar was an undrafted guy the grizz signed to a 3 year deal and he is the most unassuming yet fluid looking basketball player in pretty much every facet of the game. I think his highlights against the Lakers last season are out there where you can see him outrebound Dwight howard.
"Everything you said is right, I just think Prime Dwight Howard is a monster, and with AD ability to space the floor it‚Äôs a perfect partnership.  That is true of Lebron, but prime Russ would elevates all of his effort, since he can handle the ball.   The Spurs are a great team and I would pay to watch the series, he‚Äôll I might try it on 2K"
"Prime Dwight Howard was an absolute monster, the Magic were an excellent defense and it was almost entirely due to him"
Imagine saying this about a team with Wayne Ellington as starting SG and completely broken down Dwight Howard as starting C.
"&gt;They traded for Dwight Howard  Poverty Lakers franchise managing to convince a player who demanded a trade and threatened to leave for nothing to play for LA, not sure how they did that. Because who wants to play in Los Angeles?  &gt;Why don't you bring up other famous ring chasers who went to other orgs in their twilight years like Barkley? How bought all those ring chasers on the Heat and Cavs with Lebron? The ring chasers on the Warriors. Like bringing up ring chasers is your big argument? Shaq and Lebron are their big free agents acquisitions.  Because LA does it more frequently than anyone else. They don't have nearly as many issues as other teams do when it comes to luring free agents. I guarantee if they traded AD right now, they'd have no issues luring 2022 top free agents to LA and I'd even expect them to be in the mix for Damian Lillard.  &gt;Shaq and Lebron are their big free agents acquisitions.  Poverty Lakers only managing to sign two top 10 players of all time in free agency in a \~20 year span"
Gary Payton  Karl Malone  Chris Paul  Dwight Howard  Steve Nash  Pau Gasol  Metta World Peace
"They traded for Dwight Howard. Steve Nash was 38, Karl Malone 40, Gary Payton 38. Those guys signed with the team because the Lakers were champion contenders and made moves like drafting Kobe or trading for Pau to make those teams the quality they were. Why don't you bring up other famous ring chasers who went to other orgs in their twilight years like Barkley? How bought all those ring chasers on the Heat and Cavs with Lebron? The ring chasers on the Warriors. Like bringing up ring chasers is your big argument? Shaq and Lebron are their big free agents acquisitions."
"Yeah you're right, being the GM of the most famous NBA franchise is such a difficult job compared to other teams. Really getting the short end of the stick there. I for one am glad to see that the Lakers FINALLY caught a break when they signed LeBron then had AD demand a trade to them. Almost as glad as I was to see the Lakers catch a break all those years ago when Dwight Howard and Steve Nash decided they wanted to play for them. Or even back when Karl Malone and Gary Payton decided to. Maybe even getting Shaq to play in LA, but who remembers that?  Truly the Lakers are on the same level as every franchise in the NBA. The Lakers have truly struggled to acquire superstars, and you really hate to see it. I wish the Lakers didn't have to struggle so much :( It's so great to see young players turn down exponentially more money to take the veteran's minimum with LA."
"Let's be real: LeBron made his own decision based on whatever he thought before talking to anyone from the Lakers, it's not like Magic or Pelinka were the deciding factor there. But people do overlook the fact that the Lakers have built that brand that is such a lure to people. Yes, of course being in LA helps, but the Lakers have *always* been a team to go all in and do what it takes to win.   When LeBron was in Cleveland he had to keep a figurative gun to Dan Gilbert's head by having an opt out every year to make sure they wouldn't cheap out. Milwaukee just won and it looks like because everyone is under contract they are suddenly keeping a very close eye on their spending. Look at how many key players Boston has lost in free agency in recent years because they didn't want to spend market rate for those players. Look how much trouble Chicago has had since Jordan left cause they didn't want to pay the tax. Same with Houston and many other teams.   The Lakers aren't alone in this of course (Miami and Golden State spring to mind), but the Lakers have always been willing to take huge swings and do whatever it takes to win, and I have to imagine that's very attractive to the biggest free agents. If you're one of the best players in the league you have to be confident that if you sign with the Lakers then you're not going to be wasting a lot of years there languishing in mediocrity. They may fuck themselves in the long term (like they did when they tried to get Nash and Dwight Howard in the same summer), but they will *always* take that chance. That's their reputation and it's a big part of why players consistently want to go there."
"They also just aren't even better healthy. Melo is a massive net negative, Ariza is only narrowly better, Ellington and Monk are average bench players at best...Dwight Howard might legitimately be their 4th best player.   LeBron + AD is such a great 1-2 that they're in the conversation, but they'll need both those guys playing top 7 levels."
Dwight Howard fucked his brains out.
"Reminds me of this one line from a song in NBA 2K:   ""Hall of Famer like Shaq and Magic. Like Kobe Bryant I'll back-to-back it. Shoot the 3 if I have to Nash it, Dwight Howard when I'm at the basket."""
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Andre Iguodala, Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, Damian Lillard  Edit: Marc and Pau Gasol"
"I mean, if you're talking about isolating one single position, then it's way, way more rare for the best player to be the *second* pick.    KD, and maybe LaMarcus Aldridge are the only two examples in the last 20 years.    Meanwhile you've got Yao Ming, LeBron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, AD, and arguably John Wall and Zion who are #1 picks who turned out to be best in the draft."
Must have been when Dwight Howard was playing there huh?
Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard and Danilo Galinari
Anthony Davis. Dwight Howard
"Tbf, the Dwight Howard gay rumors were fake while Kelvin Benjamin was observably a hefty boy and there has definitely been a big movement towards people (justifiably) looking down on those who spread fake news over the last few years because of...well, all the craziness. Granted there are still tons of things that people know are fake but still like to bag on anyway, but generally of the harmless variety like ""Pelinka doesn't know about the salary cap"" or ""Cuban is driving around Dallas begging through texts""."
"The Kelvin Benjamin jokes are at a crossroads, sometimes they'll get you upvoted and other times downvoted.  It kinda reminds me of all the Dwight Howard gay jokes which would get tons of upvotes a few years ago but get downvoted into oblivion now."
"&gt; ""Run away! Run away!""  Keep runnin', it's amusing.  Better luck next time.  You keep using these completely useless phrases as if you're accomplishing something.  So many words and so little substance.  And finally.  This you?  See unlike you I like to know what I am talking about before I say something.  Your hate boner for Duncan is ridiculous.   Absolute abomination that Duncan never won DPOY.  Quite a bit of context is missing here.  Duncan is also one of extremely few players* to play with two different DPOY -- Robinson and Leonard -- plus 8-time All-defensive Bruce Bowen. Without one of those three as a teammate, Duncan anchored Spurs' defenses rated 8th, 10th, and 11th, which is very unremarkable. For two of those seasons Duncan also had Danny Green, another all-D teammate.  *LeBron James has played with Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, and Marc Gasol, obviously, but none were close to DPOY level at that time. A few other Spurs also played with David Robinson and Dennis Rodman, but Rodman was years' removed from that level of play/sanity. Some 2020 Clippers played with Leonard and Joakim Noah -- the latter for 5 games.  That's how rare Duncan's defensive teammates are, which should be taken into account.  also shows that even as a 40 year old and after declining that the Big Fundamental was still great on defense.  Both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1-rated Spurs' defenses without Duncan. Duncan never came close without one of those two, or Bowen -- his best being 8th, as noted above.  including the greatest defensive rating in the modern era (2004)  Not coincidentally, in the second-lowest scoring season in the modern era. Crediting Duncan for that, is disingenuous to the extreme. His defense is wildly overrated."
if you have a shot at dwight howard why not?
"edit: for what it's worth, we're having a discussion and I wish people didn't downvote you. Many people on this sub weren't old enough to watch properly back then, this is(even in disagreement), at least a solid discussion for those times and gives at least some insight to people.   No, Karl is a known dickhead, as I said, but in terms of Melo's time in Denver he was not wrong. Unlike the players you listed, the majority of Melo's playoff performances outside of 2009 speak for themselves. Those teams had no business always being knocked out in the first round. Even in terms of regular season success, they had their best year after trading Melo.  Bzdelik was fired because of Melo. It is well known. Read the links. Read the history. It wasn't just because of Melo, it was a beef with his star player.  And instead of Chandler they could have simply included Chauncey instead of using their amnesty clause on him and added more picks. Gallo was the main piece of that trade, so it would be Gallo vs. Eric Gordon as the centerpiece and while Gordon has the edge, Gallo was still a very good young piece.   D'Antoni wanted a point guard centered offense because his offenses tend to thrive under those conditions. Melo didn't want a reduced role or even want to consider. Just like Melo didn't want to come off the bench on the Thunder. All because, as he says in the quote, he was the star. That is being a diva my guy.  He didn't work out in LA because Nash got hurt two games into the year and was hurt even when D'Antoni came in. He also didn't get a training camp with the team and was signed after 5 games into the season. On top of that issue, Dwight Howard never actually fully recovered from his back issues so our defensive suffered. Dwight also didn't want to run much pick and roll even though he excelled at(well he did prior to the back issues). Did he beef with Pau over Pau's role? What did he want from Pau? To stand out towards the three point line. Sounds like he was ahead of his time in that regard, but at the time it seemed weird and a poor decision(Pau would later begin a stretch big). With all that said, they still made a massive comeback behind Kobe's greatness...and then he tore his achilles. D'Antoni never worked out on the Lakers because of a myriad of injury issues and the lack of training camp, not because of his scheme or asking Pau to go to the three point(as he was right)."
"Great series since it featured one of the last few battles between two top big men.  Also, that season/this series was like the last 'burst' of prime Dwight Howard.  After that, he had an injury and never 100% came back from that."
How did Dwight Howard manage to matter so little in the NBA lol
i heard he also met Dwight Howard who instantly started grab-assing him
"Yeah that‚Äôs blasphemy. Moses Malone won 3 straight MVPs and was not only the best player on a championship team but also the best player in the league for almost 5 years. Bill Russell has 11 rings and was a better rebounder and defender than Howard. At best Howard is like 8th and I wouldn‚Äôt put him over Ewing or Robinson either.  Shaq, Kareem, Wilt, Hakeem, Russell, Moses, Ewing, Robinson, and then maybe Howard. I‚Äôm probably forgetting about someone too so Dwight is most likely 9th or 10th realistically."
Here you go. Enough said   * Dwight Howard played 41 games  * Trevor Ariza  * Jason Terry was like 37 years old  * Kostas Papanikolaou  * Corey Brewer played 56 games  * Josh Smith  * Pablo Prigioni played 24 games and like 37 yo  * Terrence Jones played 33 games  * Donatas Motiej≈´nas  * Clint Capela played 12 games  * Joey Dorsey  * Patrick Beverley played 56 games   * K. J. McDaniels played 10 games
"Ok first let me just break check you real quick. Shaq 2000-2004 ok, sure you can claim that, 2005 onwards tho? Nah cause Wade carried that haul in his next championship. Lebron, 2005-2010, sure if you want have it, but he lacked defensively and couldn't shoot well 10 ft out which gave the team lack of spacing. 2000 to 2010 tho? I mean only 1 other player during that time span can have an argument over Kobe and that's maaaybe Duncan.   However, Duncan had a squad that whole time and it never skipped a beat. Parker and Ginobli put a lot of work into that team from 2003-2010. Kobe on the other hand had to deal with a rebuild after the Shaq stuff. Duncan was the best player on his team but the later part of 2000's he started to rely a lot on Pop, Manu and Ginobli. Kobe in 2005-2010 mostly relied on Phil and then on Gasol to a lesser degree. Gasol was no Parker + Ginobli combo for him, he wasn't Tim Duncan either.  Let's also think for a moment. From 2001-2010, Kobe was legit just unstoppable and unguardable. You couldn't find anyone in the league that could stop him from doing what he wanted to do unless they fouled him or he just missed the shot. If Duncan was unstoppable, this dude would have averaged 28-30 just like Kobe, but there was always multiple people around in the 2000's that was capable of slowing Duncan down, more so in the 2005-2010 time frame.   Teams like Grizzlies, Lakers, Bobcats, Nuggets, Suns.. I mean tons of centers made Duncan very uncomfortable scoring, which is where Parker and Manu played a huge role in Spurs success. When bigs like Duncan couldn't shoot because of their lack of ability from range, you have to go to someone, and those someones for Spurs was Manu and Parker. Kobe didn't ever need that and Shaq being around just forced the perception that Kobe needed someone like that in his career which is absolutely not true. Maybe Kobe doesn't win a lot of games from 1998 to 2002, but eventually they built over that time frame and I guarantee Kobe starts winning from 2002-2010 if Shaq was never on the Lakers.   Why you might ask? Because the mid-range game to the 3 point line in 2002 onwards was the most important part of winning period. Zone defense started kicking in and illegal defense was removed. People could start double/triple teaming whenever they wanted. Every great player in that era was effected by it. Except for the players who were capable of shooting from distance. Kobe was one of the best at that from 2002-2010, the only problem is like I said, the rebuild fucked up his prime and he had to wait just to get some decent players on his team to decoy some sort of threat around so Kobe wouldn't get quadruple teamed.  Now let's talk about defense. Kobe was also a 2 way player, which Lebron wasn't great at until his 2012 season realistically. 2003-2011 Lebron looks good defensively on paper, but watching the film over again and you'll see that he didn't stop anyone from doing what they do. He'll have great stretches of help defense, but on-ball and off-ball defense was lackadaisical. Especially down the stretch of big games, specifically the playoffs. I remember Reshard Lewis and Hedo Turkoglu just going nuts on Cleveland and the only person you could blame was Lebron and Verejao, because Mo and West aren't guarding forwards. That was on Lebron's off ball defense big time.  So next Lebron's offense in 2003-2010. The biggest flaw was that he lacked a jump shot that was consistent. He knew that driving into the lane was his most consistent way of scoring. What happens when you can't score in the paint? You get Dwight Howard to stop you. You get Kevin Garnett to stop you. Tell me again how Kobe wouldn't have solved a problem that Lebron had? Most people's argument would have been but Lebron is a pass first kinda guy!  Let's talk about Kobe's ability to facilitate the ball, Phil Jackson, and the triangle offense. Ok so, you take into account that Phils system both with MJ and Kobe was strict. You have to follow with what Phil wanted or this dude is gone. Phil didn't take shit from anyone and if you weren't with him, he always felt that he was bigger than you so he would just turn coat and leave. So MJ and Kobe HAD to buy into the system for 90% of the game.   If anyone knows anything about the triangle offense, it has 3 points right? Ball handler makes a pass, the second point then passes the ball to the third point or back to the first point to score. That's just the typical triangle. Most often, the first pass comes from a guard, and then from the guard it goes to a forward or a center who then passes to get an assist or fakes to score. Take into account if you will, that Shaq recorded a higher average assist count on the Lakers than any other team he's played on. In Phil's system, you always have to pass at least once, but the first pass is never expected to go into a scoring motion because the second potential pass has to allow the other players to cut or dive to fake as if another pass is coming at the very least before they go into scoring mode. This deflates the first touch potential assist an extreme amount. Kobe was one of those ball handlers which was either the first pass or the incoming pass from the second point. You understand how something like high assist counts are very hard for a team like this by now right? Lebron isn't going to have 7-8 assists a game in this system for a whole season.   The fact that Kobe had as high of an assist count in the triangle offense as he did is in it's own right not typical from a SG stand point. This is where the 10% of buying into the system comes in. A LOT of Kobes assists actually come from the freedom part that MJ and Kobe got to have once in a while. When the triangle busts open and Kobe/MJ had to improvise, Kobe in particular with the illegal defense rule being chucked out the league in 2002 sucked in a lot of defenders allowing him to get off the cuff assists. Regardless, some of the biggest winning plays of Shaq era and Gasol era were Kobe assisting in those off the cuff moments. His timely assists just came out of nowhere in the playoffs, and won big games from them.  One thing about Kobe is that he really allows his teammates to feel the game for themselves and none of those players ever become reliant on Kobe to get them buckets. They create with or without Kobe at their own consistency and he was very good at letting them get into their own rhythm every single game. That's why when Kobe did pass to them at the end of quarters, they capitalize on that because they had their time to handle the ball through out that game and create their own imprint.  Kobe was absolutely the best player and best winner from 2000 to 2010, there is no ifs ands or buts about it.  As far as all time legacy goes, that's all opinion right. You want Lebron over Kobe, ok that's fine. You want to say MJ and Lebron were the absolute best on their teams? Well being drafted to a team with stars already is a curse and a blessing because Kobe had to fight for minutes to come off the bench for a role he didn't even play. His first 2 years Del Harris was trying to force him to be a SF off the bench for Rick Fox, who was an already established veteran, when he was clearly a SG/PG.  Also, I will say Kobe would win more titles than Lebron, same ages, if he was in Lebrons shoes with those teams he's had and that's just straight facts from my perspective. Because Kobe beat that Spurs in their prime with a 27 game old Laker in Gasol who was still trying to learn the triangle. Kobe wouldn't have sunk in the moment when Wade was going off against Mavs. Kobe wouldn't have worried about Chandler bullying him around the rim, cause he had the outside shot. That's 4 straight for Kobe. Kobe probably loses to KD Warriors but there's no chance Kobe doesn't go sky fucker mode against sky fucker himself in 2015 and 2016. Kobe wins 6 straight if he goes in the exact same path Lebron did from 2011 to 2016 injuries and all. He would then win with AD and there's really no debating that.  All said and done, neither Kobe or Lebron are above Wilt, MJ or KAJ. Wilt is the GOAT followed by MJ, KAJ. After those 3, I'll put Kobe, Lebron, Magic, Bird, Hakeem, Russell, Shaq and that's that.   People always ask why Kobe is over Magic and I'll say this. Kobe won 2 titles while being the absolute head over heels front runner best player on his team, where as Magic never had a single championship where he was so far ahead that you can say Magic carried the team. Kobe carried the Lakers for 8 years straight and then his achilles blew out. Did Magic ever once carry the Lakers? He had plenty of scorers on his team helping out from his rookie year to the day he retired, scorers who continued scoring just as well after he was gone."
With dwight howard and rajon rondo's advice he's almost guaranteed to light up the league next yr
"YOU ADD DWIGHT HOWARD TO THE MIX AND THE NUMBERS DRASTIC GO UP!THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE, AND THEY SPELL DISASTER FOR YOU AT SACRIFICE!"
"It looks like shit, but in a different way. He has no arm extension, both arms are in on the action, and he's limp writing it.  NBA players (see Dwight Howard) can make tons of shots in an open gym.  Having robust enough mechanics to hit them consistently in game is a different thing."
"well it's going to be a new list of 75, rather than adding 25 to the 50 list. But even so, I took a stab at it. Top 25 of last 25 years.    16 Locks (not in order): LeBron, Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, Durant, Nowitzki, CP3, Wade, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Kidd, Nash, Dwight Howard, Iverson and Giannis     7 in the next tier (not in order): Gary Payton, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Pierce and Tony Parker  That means 2 spots left out of: Tracy McGrady, Draymond Green, Paul George, Ray Allen and Grant Hill. I would personally lean towards McGrady and Allen."
Dwight Howard
Yeah you‚Äôll even see the guys like Dwight Howard and Clint capela raining down 3s no problem
"I mean if they do have a ceremony they‚Äôll probably presented as part of their most linked team like they did at the 50th Anniversary:  ‚ÄúRepresenting the New York Knicks, at Forward, Carmelo Anthony‚Äù  ‚ÄúRepresenting the Orlando Magic, Center, Dwight Howard‚Äù  ‚ÄúRepresenting the Cleveland Cavaliers, Forward, LeBron James‚Äù  Sadly, Kobe would be honored posthumously."
"Shit, one of the worst games I've ever been to was Hawks at Brooklyn. Tickets for $27 to sit in the lower level. Got to see Hawks legend Dwight Howard vs Brook Lopez going 1 for 55 from 3.  I'm sure those same seats for the same teams would cost a little more now"
"In 03-04 the Lakers had Kobe, Shaq, Malone, Payton, Horace Grant  9 years later, the 12-13 Lakers had Kobe, Nash, Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, and Metta World Peace  9 year later will be the 21-22 Lakers with Lebron, Russ, Melo, AD, and Dwight  I wonder what their ""superteam"" of past their prime all-stars will look like 9 years from now."
Insane how easily people forget Dwight Howard lol.
*cough* Dwight Howard 2009 *cough*
"If Dwight Howard went to those pro ams, he‚Äôd get 50 points and 30 boards"
"He's not a 30 (29 but whatever) ppg guard anymore. That's like saying Dwight Howard is still a 20 ppg, 14 rpg player."
He gets shitted on because he doesn‚Äôt attempt these threes in games. Dwight Howard even attempts more threes then Ben
Dwight Howard is definitely on this list.
"Dwight Howard in Orlando for sure. Probably everywhere else he ever went too since he‚Äôs an insufferable, hypocritical asshole."
"Physicality maybe but certainly not mentally. Larry Bird wasn‚Äôt the most athletic guy even in his own day but he could outsmart even the best of them in this era. Physicality is just one part of the game. It‚Äôs very mental and only people who‚Äôve played understand this aspect. Dwight Howard is one of the most athletic NBA players of all time. I‚Äôd rank him up there with Wilt (in terms of pure athleticism), but Hakeem is a better player because he had athletic ability as well as the extremely high basketball IQ."
"Charles Barkley actually said, when asked about John Amaechi and playing with a gay teammate, that it wasn't a big deal and *that he'd played with gay teammates before*, so it's definitely more common than the instances of players coming out. I mean there was the whole thing with Dwight Howard as well."
"KD second best player in 2008-2009?  nah.  LeBron, Kobe, Wade, CP3, Dwight... all better individually as well as team achievements.    Maybe you're thinking 2010 just because KD got 2nd place in the MVP voting, but even then no one was picking him ahead of Kobe. Just like how you wouldn't pick Jokic ahead of KD just because he won the MVP.  2011, behind LeBron, Howard, Rose, and Kobe.   It really wasn't until the Finals run that people had him as the 2nd best player.  I love KD and his swagger, but we won't have Jordan conversation, that's a stretch."
"&gt; If you wanna say Harden was ‚Äúflat out‚Äù better offensively, then provide something support your point  Offensively harden is a better scorer overall scorer than ai ever was and as a playmaker those two shouldn't even be in the same sentence. I really cant think of anything he has over harden offensively  &gt; Respectfully I don‚Äôt think any harden playoff run is comparable at all to what Allen Iverson did in 2001.   Harden two playoff series with the rockets with cp3. Yes ai averaged more points than harden compared to his first run with cp3 on 8 less shots a game and then the next year almost match his output on 6 less shots a game but did it more efficiently than ai ever did respectfully. Also consider the fact harden was a cp3 injury away from beating the greatest team ever and winning a championship and ran into that same team again and lost mostly cause cp3 looked washed and his other teammates weren't enough to take on the warrior...yeah harden has that there respectfully  Never said harden hasnt ever shrunk (its the reason why I dont have him over wade) but its not like Iverson also has never underperformed either. Outside of his 01 run he's never come close to that success. Since you played hypotheticals with wade, you put harden in that weak eastern conference with his offensive production with his scoring and playmaking you think he also wouldn't carry the sixers to the finals better yet multiple finals appearances considering his competition would pretty much be Jason kidd or Reggie miller?  &gt; It‚Äôs fair to say they weren‚Äôt great defensively but Ai has been the steals leader 3x to Hardens zero. If you wanna disregard that stat that‚Äôs up to you.  Leading the league in steals doesnt make you a good defender. Steph I think has lead the league in steals before iirc but he's never been a good defender  &gt; I also don‚Äôt understand how you can diminish that 01 run when he was literally the entire offence for that squad but mention harden ‚Äúcarrying bad teams‚Äù when Harden has been surrounded by better talent in his career than Ai had  Cause Iverson 01 team was elite defensively and had a good coach. Same cannot beat said lets say for example 2015 rockets when his 2nd best player (dwight howard) was dealing with injuries throughout most of year"
It‚Äôs funny when TNT is showing a Dwight Howard highlight of him dunking and Chuck or Kenny is like ‚Äúman he looked like Superman on that one‚Äù and glance at Shaq üòÇ

"Really his problem is he just doesn't have a realistic outlook on how good he actually is. This is really a problem for any player who is like this. It's a big part of what the drawbacks to Russell Westbrook have been, just like it was with later career Allen Iverson, and like it was for years with Melo and Dwight Howard.   But those guys were all absolute stars who just had a hard time accepting that their role had changed as their skills declined. Schroder is clearly a guy who's ceiling is basically a very good bench player, but he apparently thinks he's a star, and that's why teams aren't willing to give him a contract.   Teams are willing to gamble on him for a small one year deal, where it's not too costly if it doesn't work out and they have to cut him, but nobody wants to make a big commitment to a guy who has a good chance of causing problems because he won't accept his role. Like even a team like Boston who needs a PG won't want to invest too heavily in a guy who may come in and picture himself as part of a ""Big 3"" with Tatum and Brown.   I'm sure if Schroder was fully willing to happily just be a 6th man and lead a bench unit on a salary that matched that role then the Lakers would probably be willing to bring him back. But who wants to give more than a small, short contract to a talented player who has a high risk of causing a bunch of problems with team chemistry? Nobody doubts that Schroder can actually play, this is all about his attitude and his willingness to accept a role which matches his skills."
Its easy to cherry pick a single stat to run with a narrative just like you did by singling out Bibby's pre trade 3pt % (i can make a case for Dwight Howard being the best 3 point shooter in finals history by using the same disingenuous tactic) . Its much harder to find 8 different metrics that make your case - which is what I did
"NBA was still locked in on the big man being the most important player to get. In fact from 1990-2009 a big man was taken with the first pick all but 4 times. 1994 Glenn Robinson, 1996 Allen Iverson, 2003 LeBron, &amp; 2008 Derrick Rose were the only non C/PF drafted 1st overall. Looking back i count only 5 bigs that should have been the no brainer number 1 pick. Shaq, Webber, Duncan, Yao Ming, &amp; Dwight Howard were the obvious choices. I didn't look at every draft but i guess you could argue Kenyon Martin in 2000 was the best bet at the time. The 2000 draft was absolutely awful. Martin was certainly better than the next 3 selections of Stromile Swift, Darius Miles, &amp; Marcus Fizer (no clue who this even is). But looking back at other drafts is stunning to think who they thought was the best player in the draft."
"Plus, Dwight Howard shot 60% from 3 on the 2019-20 Lakers, so teams are going to have to respect him as a dead eye sniper."
Dwight Howard with Orlando.
Big man domination didn‚Äôt even exist in the 10‚Äôs when the most dominant big man during the time he was drafted was a back issues Dwight Howard and mid range popper LMA. There wasn‚Äôt a top 3 big men mango during that span until recently. League was already trending to small ball with the heatles with a whole curry was nursing his ankles. Almost all the top big men post Bynum and Howard prime were defensive anchors first and foremost until jokic and embiid and antetoluppomo
"&gt;Besides THT, all these guys have proven to be capable starters.   Monk has one career start.  Gasol cannot play starter minutes anymore, he's barely a capable backup.  Ellington is 34 and has never started 40 games in a season.  Howard hasn't been a starter for 3 seasons now.  Bazemore hasn't been a regular starter in three seasons.  Your claim here is an exaggeration.  They are not unusually deep, considering the current year.  If it was, say 2010, it'd be different.  &gt; If AD plays the 5, Dwight and Gasol can easily give you 15-20 solid minutes of rim protection.  The Lakers promised Davis he would not have to play the 5, as a condition to entice him to sign his contract, so that's not happening.  Gasol can only play about 10 hard minutes every other game, and that was last year, so it remains to be seen if he even has that much left.  They're going to need 30 to 35 solid minutes from Howard every game, and that's a questionable proposition.  &gt; I suspect Frank Vogel is going to spend the first few months tweaking rotations.  This is one of the biggest problems the Lakers face.  While Vogel has some strengths as a coach, managing minutes and rotations is definitely not one of them, and that's an area where he struggles terribly.  Some of these off-season moves will pan out, but some won't, and Vogel will give minutes to players in both categories indiscriminately."
When Kobe Killed Dwight Howard also ...
"Oof. Wilt would be the most dominate big in todays game, would have been more dominant than Shaq in his era due to 60's rules holding him back, and was the most athletically gifted specimen of all time.   Wilt runs the court faster than prime Lebron at 7'1"" and Wilt could jump several inches higher than prime Dwight Howard. Wilt would wipe the floor with this current league if Giannis is as great as he is. Wilt is basically a taller, faster and stronger Giannis, but Wilt had a decent fade away shot from 16ft out.   Imagine a 7'1"" center doing a Lebron chase down block more often than Lebron for 48+ minutes a game, 80 games a season."
"I feel like they have 3 guys who I would be comfortable playing over 25 minutes in a playoff game.   One of them will be 37 years old, another is injury prone and the third is Russell Westbrook.   Who else is there? Malik Monk and Dwight Howard are in your best 5? 36 year old washed up Ariza?   They are one of the shallowest contenders that I can remember."
If u were delusional in 2016 you would have said Dwight Howard  After the Lakers ring tho he‚Äôs a lock nobody can deny it now but he was def gonna make it even if he never won
"Well this is bleak and depressing. Can't believe he never grew from this, never seen a non center so talented who added nothing to his game after entering the league. He's the Dwight Howard of wing players, so gifted physically that he can be an all-star just off his talent but not driven enough to maximize that talent. Dude like TJ McConnell must lose their minds watching him,  they shouldn't be in the NBA but made it and stay because they maximize every ounce of talent they have."
"in terms of what is a power forward, giannis fits the criteria more. for example, dwight howard is a better center than steph curry, but steph curry is a better player overall"
Ben Simmons is arguably the worst postseason player of all time. He literally only can score on a fast break dunk or defensive breakdown leaving him wide open under the rim and even then he may pass it. He shot the worst free throw percentage of all time! That had nothing to do with coaching. I‚Äôve seen Dwight Howard and Javale Magee hit 10 foot jumpers he‚Äôs just a coward afraid to fail. To not attempt shots making 170+ million is ridiculous. What a disappointment. People compared him to Lebron coming out smh. Regardless of percentages Lebron was never afraid to attempt threes and midranges. This dude is broken mentally.
"Which big signing this year are you suspicious of? On the first day of free agency, all the Lakers did was annouce the signings of Dwight Howard, Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza. Did something get your hackles up about one or all of those?"
"Ah yes, the Lakers, with their blockbuster signings on day one of Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. Serious chicanery going on there."
They probably could've signed a Dwight Howard / Draymond even type player to bring off the bench and play big C minutes when they have to.
"For me it was always the Howard/Smith AAU story.  Which had me dive down, briefly, a Dwight rabbit hole. I cannot remember Dwight playing for Charlotte at all. It is omitted entirely from memory"
For a while back it was Josh Smith and Dwight Howard growing up together and playing AAU.
Dwight Smith and Josh Howard played AAU together.
Dwight Howard at C too
Shiiiit I thought he signed to play with Dwight Howard
- Igoudala - Dwight Howard - Melo
"As a human, I can totally understand him needing a mental break from basketball after that playoff run. Really broke him a little when he thought he made the right play, and then his shooting, followed by his life, gets exposed. I wish him the best and come back strong next season. You can‚Äôt be getting no shooting tips from Dwight Howard bro.   But, as an Aussie, should of played for ya dog cunt"
"Funny thing is the only really capable teams capable of guarding LeBron at the rim were Celtics big 3 and Dwight Howard. Once they retired or went west, LeBron was unleashed. When Giannis finally came through LeBron went west, which is a player that is capable of effecting LeBrons impact heavily from the East.   Now on the west Kawhi is injured yet again with no real rim protection on Clippers, Gobert is still a bambi, Warriors have no rim protection, Denver don't defense, Portland don't defense, Dallas don't defense, Suns rim protection seems too young and I don't really see anyone else being like that Celtics big 3, nor prime Dwight and not Giannis. I don't see Giannis making it to the finals again either, at least for a while. LeBron has some serious luck or very good planning when he saw Giannis and AD coming up."
"With Melo, LeBron, Dwight Howard, and Luol Deng‚Äôs dead cap salary, they also have four 18-year vets on the team."
Totally agree. I‚Äôm so sick of Dwight Howard being used as the punchline for so many homophobic jokes. Dwight seems like a genuinely nice guy which makes it even worse
"Dwight Howard. The Dwightmare was never ending and basically set the stage for all the trade drama of this decade. Nothing has ever reached the level of the Dwightmare because no one has ever spent seasons waffling between ""trade me"" and ""don't trade me""  Also introduced the idea of signing an extension to get your money then asking for the trade anyway."
Best part about all this is that Ben is Dwight Howard 2.0 of teasing us with working on his shot in the offseason only to never shoot it in the RS.  But Dwight was a center who actually didn‚Äôt actually need to learn how to shoot and Ben is (supposed to be) a PG that desperately does.
He Dwight Howard 2.0 of teasing us with working on his shot in the offseason. But it‚Äôs only a tease bc he never puts out &amp; shoots em in the RS.  Another thing to highlight is that Dwight was a center who actually didn‚Äôt actually need to learn how to shoot and Ben is (supposed to be) a PG that desperately does.
&gt;dwight howard  dwight howard's old ass?  lmfao
anthony davis and dwight howard are swatting that weak shit
I think Shaq found his new Dwight Howard.üòÇü§£  He also said he would beat up Ben during the playoffs.
If it was only current players:  PG- 1st Year Luka Doncic (2019)  SG- 2nd Year Trae Young (2020)  SF- 3rd Year Kevin Durant (2010)  PF- 4th Year LeBron James(2007)  C- 5th Year Dwight Howard (2009)
"ohhhhhhhhhhh, dwight howard would be proud."
"It's hard to be motivated from a morale standpoint when your leader is holding onto the ball that much and shooting that much. Maybe a FA or two comes LA's way if Kobe isn't so hard headed. Dwight Howard left town, and LA, yes the Lakers, the historic purple and gold, had no free agents come. That's saying something."
"That Dwight Howard has the most dunks in NBA history,  over a career. With close to 300 more than Shaq"
"Eh I'm still fine with fans talking shit, I don't want like any actual hate and I don't think it should be at the players themselves or their socials or anything. But I'm totally fine with someone saying dwight Howard is washed up or whatever even though he'd beat me or you 100 times out of 100."
"I mean, his trade value is pretty strongly correlated with his actual job and his ability to do it.   But you know, go the Dwight Howard exiting Orlando route. Be a miserable malcontent. That'll get you a great position in a decade as a cheap vet minimum player who can ring chase after your hubris has been sufficiently eroded by reality."
Okafor is just an example my guy. And Kyle Lowry made 6 straight all star games. I don't give a shit if it was in 2013 or not. There were plenty of players who would have been fantastic in the 90s and it's stupid to say there were not. It's not like the league has suddenly improved with 90s level play. It's done the opposite. As if it's not obvious Demarcus Cousins would have been dominant in the 90s. Or KD would have been anything but spectacular. Or like Curry woudln't have been an incredible shooter in the 90s when players so much his lesser were awesome.     Some of the guards like Harden would have had issues and been totally different players but yea like Dwight Howard. Z-Bo and Big Al Jefferson wouldn't have flat out been better in a league built around their specific skill sets. MJ can GTFO with that foolishness. It's just a stupid ignorant statement made specifically to get attention.
"He probably should have won a couple of them. He didn't care about stats enough - he could have played worse defense and gambled for more blocks and he probably does win an award.  Some guys once counted ""point value of blocks"" by looking at how likely a shot was to go in if not blocked given who was shooting, where they shot from, and how much time was on the clock. Then adjusted for which team recovered the ball since tapping to a teammate or yourself swings more points than swatting it out of bounds does.  And finally they subtracted 2 points for each goaltending violation.  Obviously not a perfect measure since it's just the value of the blocks, not of shot alterations or other help defense when you force a guy to pass instead of shooting by your rotation, etc, but still insightful. Duncan led the league in ""point swing via blocked shots"" 4 or 5 times and in their primary case study, once swung more points via blocked shots than Dwight Howard did despite Howard collecting like 100 more blocks that season."
"Ewing overlapped his career with the following centers:  Kareem,  Hakeem, Robert Parish, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Dikembe Mutumbo, Alonzo Mourning, Sabonis I, Brad Dougherty, Rik Smits.  In that murderers row of centers, voters looked up and down the league and said ""Yeah, Ewing is a top 3 center this year.""  Dwight Howard overlapped with:  Shaquille O'Neal, Ben Wallace, Yao Ming, Amar'e Stoudemire, Al Jefferson, Kevin Garnett (look, by this stage of his career KG was a center), Al Horford, Joel Embiid.  Dwight's list isn't terrible, and hes a great player, but its not close to Ewing's list."
Agreed. Dwight Howard is one of the most underrated players of our era. He is easily by all metrics a HOF player ...prolly has more rebounds (11th all time) and Blocks (13) than many bigs (PF or C) that are in the hall.b
I will always say there is no excuse for Dwight Howard not to retire as a top 5 center. Had all of the talent and physical gifts in the world but no fucking brains to put it all together. Still a HOFer
"Not sure why you would have an undersized all defensive team. As much as I malign Kobe for making all-defense far more than he should have, I would still take him over Payton. You don't need to stick to positions on that side of the ball. Big fast guys at every position would dominate. Likewise replace Rodman with KG, Duncan, or even David Robinson or Dwight Howard.   The all-NBA team would murder the defensive team for example. Just way too big."
"breaking news: orlando, fl ‚Äî authorities are searching for nfl heavyweight kelvin benjamin as a suspect in a murder case. he was allegedly involved in an altercation with NBA star dwight howard. parts of howard‚Äôs remains were found outside a golden corral as police scour the area‚Äôs buffets."
I just spit out my tea..  This is why the Lakers are a superior franchise.   The Celtics sign players like this guy and jabari Parker while the Lakers get Malik Monk Ellington and Dwight Howard for the minimum
"The reason Dwight Howard is definitely a HOFer isn‚Äôt just his DPOY awards, it‚Äôs the fact that he was also a great scorer in his peak and a legit mvp candidate, he also had far better longevity then Ben Wallace"
"Yeah, i don't think this guy knows that Jimmy shot around 35-36% for a couple of years. A guy like Zion or Bam with average shooting is a much more interesting thought exercise, maybe even Dwight Howard."
Dwight Howard couldn't lead the league in assists. Dwight Howard couldn't shoot like Wilt. Disrespectful
"Eh the argument is still inflating relevance with accolades. The reality - dude was a freak athlete who could block in a time when big men in the East didn‚Äôt need to shoot the 3 and had to outrebound Ilgauskaus to make the finals. For all the 2000s dominance, he was a role player without any offensive game at a time when Shaq was on the decline, Yao was perennially hurt, and Bynum was a knucklehead. Dwight was de facto best big men simply by his freakish athleticism. Playing with the Lakers exposed that the dude literally had nothing in the post, a la DeAndre Jordan or Amare Stoudemire. Once the NBA changed and big men had to actually be able to shoot, he couldn‚Äôt and his decline in athleticism lead to irrelevance for a decade until he finally swallowed his pride and adjusted his game.  I think he‚Äôs still a HOF cuz the HOF rewards big men for just being big. But the difference between him vs the likes of Giannis, who adapted his offensive game this year and stopped trying to force being the primary option, makes Howard a second ticket ballot."
Right about Utah not having it. Right about Gobert being overpaid. Right about Dwight Howard all those years. Right about Ben Simmons.
"Looks crazy on tape.  Now imagine you‚Äôre court side where you can really appreciate the size of Dwight Howard, a literal 7 foot jacked beast of a dude. And to watch another 6‚Äô6 giant literally go up and do that to him 20 feet away from you‚Ä¶ probably was insane"
Dwight Howard is definitely a HoFer.
I was about to argue that Ben Wallace deserves it based off multiple DPOY awards but then that means Rudy Gobert should make it as well as Dwight Howard..
"&gt;Wilt is just a tall Russell Westbrook I didn't forget him, I left him off on purpose. Come at me lol  I definitely think that if someone like Dwight Howard played in that era he would have had similar results. Freak athletes were just waaaaaay less common in that era."
"But the thing is if Ben had been who he could/should be y'all win the series, and he didn't so technically he cost you the series, it doesn't matter what the numbers say, and I already showed you how wrong advanced stats and just stats in general can be so those shouldn't be your main argument.  And once again numbers don't mean shit by themselves, there's no number for shots changed by a player just being in the paint, and while I didn't watch much 6ers outside from when y'all played the hawks, Dwight Howard was not a bad backup center, even if he's nowhere near where he was offensively or defensively in his prime, he's still a good defender and solid backup big. If you tell me in what ways he was bad other than just pointing at stats then I'll be more inclined to believe your argument."
"I‚Äôm not saying he was good, I‚Äôm saying he wasn‚Äôt the reason we lost the series. The numbers clearly show that.   And again, look at the numbers. Dwight Howard was our worst rotation player in both the regular season and playoffs. Don‚Äôt let his name and highlight tape fool you. I loved his energy and attitude but he brings nothing on offense and he‚Äôs not what he used to be on defense. I guess he was an upgrade from the guys we used to have (Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe, Norvel Pelle) but he still killed us in the playoffs."
"This off-season is obviously different from past off-seasons. He's never looked nearly as passive or in his own head so you can't really compare it to those past off-seasons.  And even if his net rating was positive that doesn't mean he was good, stats don't tell the whole story, and especially advanced stats. This is shown by the fact his offensive rating went up for the playoffs, and if you're trying to tell me Ben Simmons was a better offensive player during the hawks series than in the regular season then you must be on some really good crack.  Also how is Dwight Howard not a serviceable backup center? Who would be better?"
"If all these people think Dwight Howard is a lock for being a big ass dude who grabbed rebounds, then DRose should be in it too"
They're really the only title team I can remember punting on a title defense to save cap space for the following summer......and their plan was to sign Dwight Howard and Deron Williams lol
"Eh - Dwight Howard gave that Rockets team a dimension these Nets really lack, they were deeper, and that team could actually play defense.  I don't like the idea of Harden+Kyrie having to out offense opponents every night to win a 7 game series."
"Another Almost-Mav, joining Dwight Howard and CP3"
"Ben‚Äôs biggest issue isn‚Äôt even his skillset, it‚Äôs his mentality. Not only is he afraid to shoot the ball, but his work ethic and ability to handle criticism is extremely poor. In his 4 seasons in the NBA, he essentially hasn‚Äôt improved his game at all. He went from a good defender to a great defender, but his offensive game has stagnated or perhaps even regressed. He‚Äôs also been pampered his entire career by teammates and coaches who have defended him without even an ounce of criticism until the end of this postseason. The most subtle criticism he‚Äôd ever received up to this point was being moved to the 4 at the end of the 2020 season, because Brett Brown understood that Ben couldn‚Äôt be an elite point guard. Even after this postseason, the most he got reprimanded was via an insignificant Doc Rivers remark and a play-by-play criticism by Embiid (a very emotionally-charged player who still managed to remain professional as the leader of his team). Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and JJ Redick (not his teammate, but former) all defended Ben after the loss.  It‚Äôs about damn time that this kid takes the heat, and that somebody stands up to Klutch. I‚Äôm hoping Morey and the Sixers organization don‚Äôt fold."
"1986/7/8 - heard about Michael Jordan and couldn‚Äôt quite understand how he had his own model of shoe. Slightly later, I knew he had to be something because I heard he was in a Nintendo game (Jordan vs. Bird).   Early 90s - moved to America (Orlando, Florida) and got so excited about the Magic. Shaq, Penny, Anderson‚Ä¶ I became obsessed. An NBA team, right in the city where I lived!!   By the mid-90s I was a full-time fanatic and followed, as best I could, the Hornets, Spurs, and the Suns. Loved other players like Kidd, the Malone/Stockton pair, Olajuwon, Kemp, etc. This was the golden age of the NBA for me. The league felt electric. I played in a basketball league (and was a clumsy oaf) and played tons of NBA Live ‚Äò95 and other such games. NBA Jam came along somewhere in here, too.   By the late 90s, my interest began to wane in favour of playing music in various bands, preparing to be a legal adult.  Early 2000s - checked in occasionally but nothing held my interest.   Early 2010s - moved back to Orlando and followed the Magic. Dwight Howard was exciting and seemed  engaged with the city. Then he funnelled to the Lakers and I felt kind of like when Shaq left. Dropped out of active viewing again.  Late 2010s - traveled a lot for work, especially to Denver and San Francisco, and found myself watching the respective local team on the hotel tv. Steph Curry really captured my attention! Maybe you‚Äôve heard of him.   2020/1- A lot changed because of the pandemic and I thought a lot about my life and my major passions at various stages. Watched a few games (Magic, Spurs, etc.) but then found the Hornets were back in the league‚Ä¶and I was sold. It‚Äôs basketball that is fun to watch and the presenters are entertaining. I feel again like I did in the mid-90s when they‚Äôre playing, and it‚Äôs nice to revisit. Joined Reddit, joined this forum. Looking forward to next season!"
"i thought harden deserved it in 2015 and still do.  carried a pretty bad rockets squad (Dwight Howard missed 41 games and their second best player was Trevort Ariza, who averaged 12.8 ppg) to the **#2 seed**.  he played 268 more minutes than Curry.  The Warriors just won 67 games."

"honestly I bet 90% of the people never saw him play.  They are only looking at his scoring/shooting stats and thinking they describe him.   His defense was so bad, that when 'the Dwight Howard effect' paper came out at Sloan (statistical analysis conference), Bargnani was so far off his man so often, his 'defense' didn't even count as 'defense' under the basic methodology for accounting for defense.  He was the worst rebounding Center for anyone 7ft and over in the history of the NBA at the time.  He was awful."
"No, this is just looking at the stats and missing all the context. Bargnani was never good, he was merely ok at best. Just because he had a single season of ""almost"" 20 points on bad shooting means nothing.  Also the centre position in 2010 was horrible, it was almost literally Dwight Howard and no one else.  Looking at the actual numbers, he was actually 4th in the East for centres not the entire league. He had 265k votes, less votes than Nene and 65 year old Antonio McDyess. Legit only 2 centres made it over 1 million votes (Dwight -2m, Amare - 1.8m). Old ass &lt;10ppg Shaq got 800k. Bargnani's votes mean absolutely nothing as indication of how good he was"
"Dwight Howard. As the star he was disappointing but when he settled down as a role player he carved out a pretty nice career for himself.  Also, not a player but I really came around to the Warriors. Rewatching their playoff games in 15/16 really showed how special they were."
Dwight Howard?
"Dwight Howard was the definition of a cocky celebrity asshole, who was hated by his teammates and had no issue nutting in dozens of women and then leaving them to raise his biological children (who he didn't want anything to do with for at least five of them) alone.  Like would be a strong word for me, but he finally stopped acting like he was the star and committed to not being the asshole of his teams so I don't hate him anymore."
"&gt;Why in the world would we want him taking anything but wide open threes?  It's not about what you want, it's about what you get. Lakers don't have the benefit of the GOAT shooter to get Baze open shots. Plus Kerrs offensive system generates better looks than the Lakers offensive system does.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Maybe your right, but again I heard the same about Bradley, KCP, Rondo, Dwight, Javale, Morris, Kuzma and Caruso     My g, idk about you but I don't want Dwight Howard taking open 3s."
"Rudy Gobert is a three time DPOY which puts him at the ranks of Mutombo, Wallace, and Dwight Howard.  He broke multiple records for defensive impact this season alone.  The Atlantic even mentioned he should have been the unanimous DPOY this year.  [He has the best defensive raptor and prevented the most points per 100 possessions in history](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/).  He never even got exposed by James Harden in the playoffs the Jazz's perimeter defenders forcing him to respond to James Harden's layups/tear drops.  Even then he still had the most defensive impact in that series too.  You're referring to the same issues that were exposed during the clippers game.  [This reddit thread explains it well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o3mtbo/blaming_gobert_for_not_having_the_ability_to_be/)  All the people you listed were amazing big mans however you do not need to discredit  Gobert as well.  You act like the 3/4 big men given above weren't all in defensive player of the year contention in the past 3 years."
"You lead with Dwight Howard, a 35 year old still getting minutes on contenders, and then a bunch of dudes with bad injury luck."
"Dwight Howard injured his back  Yao had foot trouble his whole career  Cousins had multiple huge injuries  Ben was still very good until 32, and then broke his leg at 34  Jooks was ultra injured.  &amp;#x200B;  DJ declined quickly because he was all athletism.  &amp;#x200B;  That leave Hibbert, wether it's the concussion, mental problems, the NBA changing idk, but he didn't really decline physically"
According to this logic in 2009 Dwight Howard was better than Lebron.  Celtics also way overachieved with Kemba playing as bad as he was and Gordon Hayward still dealing with injuries.  Celtics have been to lik 3 or 4 of the last 6 eastern conference finals almost always led by Tatum.   Butler is on the wrong side of 30 and will likely start trending downwards while Tatum trends upwards - that's usually what happens after all
"Fun Fact: Brook Lopez is also #37 on all time blocks in a career. There are only 2 other current players that beat him out, Dwight Howard and Serge Ibaka."
Dwight howard alternative account i reckon
Future HoF Dwight Howard.
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."

"&gt;Yes, it was all Kobe   His Mr. Strawman, can I introduce you to a Ms. Something I didn‚Äôt say.   &gt;and not the fact that the teams were dogshit.   He was a major reason why‚Ä¶  &gt;Even in 2012/13 when we had Kobe, Pau, Dwight Howard, and Steve Nash, Kobe had to absolutely backpack that team to the playoffs and ended up tearing his Achilles for it.   That‚Äôs nice, but we‚Äôre not talking about 2012-13 are we?  &gt;Then the next season he immediately gets injured and Nick Young ends up being our leading scorer. We go 27-55.   Tangent.   &gt;The next season Kobe gets injured again, leading scorer after Kobe is Nick Young again with fucking 13.4 ppg game.   So basically he‚Äôs a broke down ass old man who can‚Äôt contribute to a winning team. I‚Äôm missing the part where this makes him right for being a dickhead to a bunch of guys trying to scrap out an NBA career.   &gt;We go 21-61. The only season you can ‚Äúblame Kobe‚Äù for was his last season when he went on a retirement tour but even then he missed games due to injury and only played 28 mpg.   The guy was taking up what percentage of their salary cap as a total scrub?  &gt;We finish 17-65 and Kobe retires.   And not coincidentally good players suddenly started to play for the Lakers again.   &gt;Then the season after all this talk of ‚ÄúKobe‚Äôs gone, now there‚Äôs no one to hold the team back.‚Äù We have a young core of lottery picks and go 25-56.   Is 25 more than 21? Asking for a friend.   &gt;Those laker teams were always garbage. Kobe is just the easy target.  Yeah, because he sucked and he was an asshole to everyone on the team despite being a horrendous player."

Nah. Shaq would definitely say that about Dwight Howard if he had a heart problem.
Dwight Howard as washed  I truly think he is valuable and this is one of the most contrasting results of getting superstar calls and not getting them at all.   I think he actually plays pretty well right now
"Doubling Dwight Howard every single play leaving Turkoglu, Lewis, Nelson and Pietrus wide open for 3s."
"Sample size skews this significantly, as Zion's numbers only account for a comparatively brief time where he's been the center of his team, versus someone like Dwight Howard who has a ton of minutes past his prime where he's acting as a role player.  I think you need to either do peak individual season comparisons or something like each player's peak three-season average.  Maybe the numbers stay the same, but I feel like a lot of the players lower on the list will jump up a bit."
"A better playmaking, maybe worse shooting version of Tim Duncan mixed with prime Dwight Howard. Incredibly intelligent, so he would adjust to the modern NBA really fast. Hard worker, so modern skill, shooting, strenght and conditioning coaches would help him a lot.  Would make teams like the Hawks, Suns, Mavericks and Blazers nearly unbeatable."
2009 Dwight Howard with more maturity and leadership
Admiral gets a ton of flack because Hakeem when HAM on him in the playoffs when he won MVP. but prime Admiral was like if you gave prime Dwight Howard a decent mid range jumpshot and actual post moves.
"KAT‚Äôs definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there‚Äôs definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don‚Äôt know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who‚Äôs better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That‚Äôs 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I‚Äôd put above him but are debatable"
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid.

"Simmons isn't a Rondo type of non shooter.  Rondo for his career takes about 35% of his shots from beyond 16 feet (16% from 3). Thats even including his Boston days when people barely cared about guys who dont take threes.   Simmons sits at 3%, with 1% coming from 3   Simmons is closer to a Dwight Howard shot profile wise than a Rondo"
Rondo (soon to be Grizzlies)  Iverson (Grizzlies)  Igoudala (Grizzlies)  Rasheed Wallace (Hawks)   Dwight Howard (Grizzlies)
I think this is what happened with Dwight Howard going to Philly last year. Some sort of miscommunication and he panicked and jumped to you guys.
"It's a pretty easy no. Russell, KAJ, Wilt, Shaq, Hakeem and we've hit 5 already. Then there's Ewing, David Robinson, Robert Parish, Mikan, Willis Reed, Dave Cowens, Wes Unseld, Moses and we've hit 13. Add to this Jokic (predicting ahead a little but is it really that much of a stretch?), Artis Gilmore, Nate Thurmond, and Dwight Howard.   It's really easy to argue that all of these guys give a team a better chance of winning than Dikembe."
"Oden is 33, so he'd still have a shot at being #1. He was billed as a 3"" taller Dwight Howard that was capable of hitting FTs. That player would have absolutely steamrolled the NBA."
remember when this sub blew up about that Dwight Howard post
"It's a more reasonable expectation that your perimeter defenders do an average job than a defensive center becomes an offensive star too. He'd be a supermax player then, and he's not.  The player you're saying he should be is Dwight Howard."
Yeah wtf is that lol? Rose won 113 of the first place votes. Dwight Howard got 2nd in MVP voting with 4 first place votes.
"There was no ‚ÄúLebron vs Rose‚Äù, the race was between Drose and Dwight Howard.  Edit: and Drose won comfortably"
"There's been a lot of damn good centers, especially before these past 2 decades. He just doesn't have an offensive punch.  Off the top of my head and in no order: Wilt, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Shaq, Bill Russell, Dwight Howard, Moses Malone. That's already 9 and there's probably a bunch more I can't recall."
"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ okay.   Plenty of players do embarrassing shit. MJ had a gambling addiction. Dwight Howard had that press conference with Stan Van Gundy. Gordon Hayward had that weird Player‚Äôs Tribune article come out after his Celtics signing already leaked. Kevin Durant‚Äôs twitter burners. Paul George (just him. All of him).  And yet, AD got exactly what he wanted. The Lakers obviously got exactly what they wanted. And the Pelicans got an amazing package which would look better if not for random Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams trades.   So‚Ä¶ I think your point that it was a mess is just asinine."
"Way back when, I attended basketball camp and he was one of the superstars to show up. Dude had incredible hops and was just freakishly stronger than anyone I've ever met before. The only other player that might be comparable to him in athleticism/strength would be prime Dwight Howard"
"Bruce Brown, Dwight Howard, Dwayne Dedmond."
"Dwight Howard should be on the bigs, he had crazy hops"
That's not how it works. Lebron wasn't far off Howard and there's no guarantee he wouldn't have gotten more of Rose's votes than Dwight. Saying Lebron wouldn't have won if Rose didn't is almost as stupid as thinking Rose deserved it at all.
Dwight Howard as well.
Dwight Howard was amazing in his prime. Man had hops like no other
"Nah more like the Lakers org and the Lakers being in LA made that happen. I can't recall a star joining forces with Kobe. Pau was traded to the Lakers for peanuts. Dwight Howard was also traded to the Lakers. In fact, Dwight didn't want to play with Kobe and ended up signing with the Rockets. Kobe was toxic af that he drove star players away instead of joining him."

"&gt;a function of him not being in his declining years.  If you look at the list, that's a big part of it.  How do you evaluate someone like Dwight Howard, who's plugging along with bench roles for years, against Yao Ming, who retired due to injuries?"
"Nah man, they basically disqualified Duncan because he could win the MVP in any season and did it 3 times. It seems like the media that the award should go to defense only type of guy at that time.   Ben Wallace would never win an MVP. Neither would Camby or Artest. Dwight Howard was unique, man was a damn freak."
"No, it is correct. After this season starts, Dwight Howard will have played in more seasons post back injury in Orlando than Yao Ming played period. Derrick Rose is entering his 9th season since tearing his ACL, Yao Ming only played in 9 seasons total."
"If Dwight isn‚Äôt great in a matchup, Gasol and DJ probably won‚Äôt be either. They‚Äôre kind of doing the same thing defensively as far as guarding bigger centers. What Howard did against Jokic is what they got Gasol to do. But Howard is a more capable PnR defender which is the bigger threat. I don‚Äôt really understand the idea that Howard isn‚Äôt great in a lot of matchups but DJ, I guess, is going to step in and do work in those instances? What exactly is he good at now? He‚Äôs a worse version of Howard defensively, something more like what Howard was before he returned to LA. He‚Äôs apparently not actually defending big post up centers and he doesn‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt step foot outside the paint defending PnR.   Where Howard doesn‚Äôt quite fit is maybe with Westbrook if they aren‚Äôt surrounded by shooting."
"If Rondo goes to the Lakers, the only active starter from the 2013 All Star game to not be on the Lakers/Nets is Chris Paul.  &amp;#x200B;  |EAST|WEST| |:-|:-| |Rajon Rondo - Lakers|**Chris Paul - Suns**| |Dwyane Wade - Retired|Kobe Bryant - Retired :(| |LeBron James - Lakers|Kevin Durant - Nets| |Carmelo Anthony - Lakers|Blake Griffin - Nets| |Kevin Garnett - Retired|Dwight Howard - Lakers|"
&gt; could contain Dwight Howard physically (to a degree) in his Magic days  If by that you mean he could foul hard enough prevent the and 1 then I agree completely
"People who say Shaq was a student of the game are overstating that a bit. What made Shaq extremely dangerous was that he was the biggest, strongest guy in the league and ALSO had the agility and fluidity of someone who was 6'6"". This in a time when most centers were 7' but very stiff. The players who defended Shaq best through his career were slightly smaller guys who were very strong and could match his quickness. Rodman and Dale Davis come to mind from the 1990s.  Now, you might be saying, ""What makes that any different than Dwight Howard?"". I'm glad you asked. Dwight in his prime was a freak athlete and also really big, but he didn't have lateral quickness and fluidity on that level. Also, to give Shaq some love, Shaq had a lot of fundamentals that big guys didn't tend to work on, like ballhandling and passing on a break. However, even if you erase all of the fast break stuff, Shaq was just difficult to deal with due to his combination of size and quickness. And you can see in clips that even as he put on 60 pounds over his career, he didn't lose much of that agility, which shouldn't be possible."
"&gt;this team is half veterans,  Exactly. And that is why he should have been brought back.   The team is full of veterans who are *new to the L.A. area*, and we see how great that worked out for the Lakers in 2020 when Dudley was a huge presence in the lockerroom that won a chip. Dwight Howard already admitted that Jared's one of his best friends and is a main reason that he wanted to come back this year.   This a very, very **unwise** move by Rob and Kurt and Jeanie, when you look at the low money/high lockerroom upgrade, it creates."
"I don't believe WS/Year is the best metric, and it shows at both ends of the spectrum, with Anthony Edwards, and Dwight Howard.  Who at the ends of their carrer weren't powerhouses.  You don't draft 1st  picks for them to be ""decent career long contributors"" You draft them to put you over the top.  We judge stars and busts largely based on how they were at their peak.  Your ranking drags down guys like Howard a lot simply because they are playing past their peak.  And it overvalues guys like Bogut for average play for a long time.  A guy like Ben Simmons shouldn't be ranked above Blake Griffin.  Simmons' best year would be Blake's 5th best. Simmons' 3rd best year would be Blake's 8th best year.  We still debate if Simmons is a bust.  Nobody does that with Blake.   Yeah, Simmons hasn't played as long, but his peak isn't close to Blake's.     IMO, the better measure is something like Baseball's [JAWS](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/jaws) (for evaluating HOF)  Thus a simple metric might be    - Average WS of best 6 seasons   Or    - (Average WS of best 6 seasons  + TOTAL Carrer WS) / 2  Depending on how much weight *longevity* has in your mind for determining a bust."
"&gt; a relationship expert  You missed your window in the Nick Young/D'Lo years then.  Unless this is code for ""stop Dwight Howard from impregnating all the Laker Girls""."
"To be fair, it's per year, so he is a little inflated because he's still in his prime. Guys like Dwight Howard get dinged for having a long post-prime career."
"Rudy Gobert is a deserving 3 time winner. Duncan had the misfortune of playing the same time as guys like Ben Wallace, Ron Artest, and Dwight Howard. 07 is the one year he should have won and even then, it wasn't THAT big of a mistake. Camby was a legit great defender as well."
OKC Perkins wasn‚Äôt that bad üòÇ in his prime he was one of the few centers who could contain Dwight Howard physically (to a degree) in his Magic days
Beats you every time! but just like Dwight Howard he‚Äôs nothing more then a role player with his free throw percentage!
"I remember after the Lakers won the championship in 2020, I dreamt that I was celebrating with them. when we open the locker room doors it led straight into the underground/multistories parking lot. We got on a plane when I asked ""wheres the pilot?"" which Dwight Howard replied""don't worry I know how to fly a plane"". He then proceeds to crash the plane right after lift off.And then for whatever reason i was on a school bus in a cornfield after the crash."
"KAT has to be one of the most underrated players in the league because of how shit the Timberwolves are. Obviously, he isn't the #1 player you'd start a franchise with now, but he is still exceptional (as evidenced in OP's #s).  That being said, I don't love the idea of average win shares because playing long after your prime (a la Dwight Howard) gets you punished. Cumulative WS might be more ideal though that obviously makes it hard to grade more newly drafted players."
"Dwight Howard has the most rebounds of any non HoFer and has more than 4,000 more than any active player"
Dwight Howard
Had a dream back during the 2013 season that the lakers were in the middle of a playoff game and Dwight Howard knocked out Kobe in the middle of the court and then proceeded to hit the game winning dunk. The team celebrated while Kobe was laid out.
"I was so bummed when he left Orlando. I really thought he was going to spend his whole career there. If you would have told me in 2010 that Dwight Howard would play for 7 different team, and have 3 stints in LA, I wouldn't believe it. The man changes his team every year."
Don‚Äôt like three point shooting. I like really athletic players who dunk a lot. Prime Dwight Howard and Derrick Rose was two of my favorite players to watch.
I think what separates Vince from other high flyers is just that he can take off from any position. Like you couldn't imagine Dwight Howard jumping off of one foot and floating for slam and you can't imagine Russell Westbrook taking off from a 2 foot standstill and destroying the rim. But Vince could do it all
"&gt;Morris stepping on Lukas ankle  So luka was the victim of a dirty play and fans took luka's side  &gt;Jokic ‚Äòdisrespect‚Äô posts because Lebron didn‚Äôt call him the MVP  So lebron went against the general consensus and fans took to the general consensus (also I guess we're pretending Jokic doesn't get disrespected for some reason?)  Either way idk what you'd expect those threads to be like but it's p much exactly like any other thread along those lines.   And you could at least try to get your facts right if you're gonna claim something; Luka didn't lead the league in techs, that goes to Dwight Howard who seems pretty well liked by this sub atm, Luka's tied with Devin Booker who...also seems pretty well liked by this sub atm; the thread reporting on the Luka/Carlisle drama isn't even particularly positive toward Luka (...also it wasn't a ""public"" feud in the first place, it only got reported on months after the fact?); etc etc...  face it, man. Even the most controversial stars in the league get to be this sub's ""golden boy"" at various points, hell just look at any Westbrook thread in the last few games this season. You're not hitting on anything special by focusing on just the white ones  &gt;And I played ball  Cool flex, man. Never said you didn't, and sometimes shit aint cool just because you personally are cool with it (or others learned to be cool with, whichever the case may be). Lots of things are normalized which arguably shouldn't be and that's not nearly the catastrophe you're pretending like I said it is, it just is what it is."
Dwight Howard isn‚Äôt a HOFer
Dwight Howard
"Serena Williams is one the GOATs of tennis, but she doesn't even hold a candle competitively to make tennis stars. I'm not really a fan of her but I have a lot of respect for women who work their asses off to the top of their field. There are definitely female athletes who put in as much as it more than their peers, but anatomically and biologically, men are just stronger.  Deanna Nolan, a WNBA, has the highest vert in the WNBA, at 34 inches. Zach Lavine has a vert of 46. Zach Lavine, at 6'5"", is 7 inches taller than her. Shaq could jump to 32 at 7'1"". Dwight Howard has a vert of 40 and a height of 6'10"". As of now, we haven't any WNBA players with both the right height and vertical to consistently make dunks."
"Wade's got blocks on probably every center in the league, from Garnett, to  Duncan, Yao, you name it, he would meet them at the apex and not give a fuck if he got posterized.  I think he's one of the players who has the most blocks on Dwight Howard"
"PG: John Stockton, Isiah Thomas   SG: Reggie Miller, Rip Hamilton  SF: Pippen, Kawhi   PF: Karl Malone, Shaun Kemp  C: Dwight Howard, David Robinson"
"Where does it say that your definition is correct? So the 86 Celtics and the Lakers in the 80's, even though they were stacked beyond all belief were not superteams? Jordan's Bulls had two top 5 players and added a ton of talent during the second three peat, that wasn't a superteam because the front office put it together instead of the players?  Love was a good stats on a bad team guy on the Wolves. He was their entire offense so he looked way better than he actually was - that is more or less acknowledged at this point. Your logic there means that the Lakers with Dwight Howard and Steve Nash were a superteam too because their stats were so much better before they joined the Lakers. Kobe recruited them even if it wasn't done as publicly as it is now.  The problem with your definition is that you are solely focused on the means of putting the team together rather than the product on the court and how the team compares to the rest of the league. We aren't talking about Fantasy Basketball, we are talking about actual games that were played with tangible statistics to back claims up. Superteams have ALWAYS existed, the means that they are assembled is the only thing that has changed."
"back when Dwight Howard was on the rockets, I saw him at Lifetime fitness playing pick up/shooting around; if you told me he was an awful shooter I'd be calling you a liar cause he was hitting everything. Mid range, 3's, etc.   it probably helped that no one could jump high enough to really contest him but he wasn't even playing seriously."
"Happened to Dwight Howard, but it was fucking hilarious."
I remember the Dan Feegan circus with the Dwightmare saga in Orlando. Publicly accused the Magic of leaking details of their meetings and saying he didn't want to meet with them further but then later admitted that he was the one that leaked details of the meetings. Stern even came out to criticize him. Dwight's Orlando teammate Jason Richardson fired him after the whole fiasco. Fegan end up being fired by Dwight Howard in 2016.
"I don‚Äôt think players who were eligible and had played the bulk of their careers the last time should be added. If their peers and people who actually watched them didn‚Äôt add them, I doubt people looking up their stats know better.   **Next 25:**  1) LeBron James  2) Kobe Bryant  3) Tim Duncan  4) Kevin Durant  5) Stephen Curry  6) Giannis Ant.  7) Kevin Garnett  8) Dirk Nowitzki  9) Dwyane Wade  10) James Harden  11) Russell Westbrook  12) Paul Pierce  13) Ray Allen   14) Chris Paul  15) Jason Kidd  16) Carmelo Anthony   17) Steve Nash  18) Dwight Howard  19) Kawhi Leonard  20) Gary Payton  21) Tony Parker  22) Dikembe Mutombo  23) Pau gasol  24) Anthony Davis  25) Klay Thompson  Honorable Mentions: Alonzo Mourning, Derrick Rose, Tracy McGrady, Reggie Miller, Chris Bosh, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Ben Wallace"
I remember seeing a lakers FT board and Dwight Howard was shooting 80% from the line in practice back when he was in his prime lol
"Embiid can shoot 3‚Äôs but I wouldn‚Äôt call him a ‚Äústretch 5‚Äù he operates inside. He‚Äôs not like a Brook Lopez who will chill in the corner to stretch the floor. The backup centers Ben has been given are Boban, Greg Monroe, Dwight Howard, and now Andre Drummond. When Embiid got hurt, Ben‚Äôs rookie year, they played ersan illyasova at the 5 and Ben played like an MVP. Yes he can‚Äôt shoot. All non prime LeBron players have flaws. Imagine they made Giannis play with any of those guys now. People would shit on the FO not Giannis."
"Imagine seven-foot jacked Dwight Howard about to hard foul and smack you with his big ass arms.  I‚Äôd cease to exist. Seriously, my ass would be on the floor."
I was supposed to be on a team with cp3 kobe lebron and dwight howard in 09. We would have won 7 rings minimum. The deal fell thru at the last second
" unpopular from a 20 year love affair with the Lakers:  *   Lakers should of ran back Shaq, Karl, and Gary in 2004 *   Lakers should of kept Caron Butler instead of Lamar *   LeBron does not handle the pressure of end of games well *   Prime Dwight Howard is the most overrated player on this sub"
"Dwight Howard was still good enough when he came back to the lakers in 2019! Like most laker fans, I hated the dude after the 2013 fiasco, but I saw how he was with Charlotte! Lost weight and improved his game. Knew he would have a redemption tour"
That Dwight Howard would rejuvenate his career some way and somehow and repair his image. I‚Äôve been saying it since like 2014 and it finally happened in 2019
how can a team that will play Carmelo anthony and dwight howard as back upa not be stacked?
"someone‚Äôs gotta punch dwight howard, ya know?"
Same as Dwight Howard
"DMC and AD expiriment, TMAC and AI on detroit, TParker and Dwight Howard on the Charlotte Hornets, Vince Carter playing in the 19-20 season"
Deandre Jordan is debuffed Dwight Howard with worse game sense
"I missed the thread about the  player most consistently overrated on this sub recently, I am debating shit posting right now with the exact same title just so I can again double down on my selection of Prime Dwight Howard. The definition of a hustle player at volume."
"Steve Francis, Turkoglu, Grant Hill, Dwight Howard Magic team. Mostly because of Steve Francis"
I might be cheating since he used to be. But Dwight Howard. He‚Äôs redeemed himself and embraced his role. Seeing him in 2020 play well and have this fun vibe off the bench and on the court has really been great to watch. Looking forward to seeing him again
"Dwight Howard because of his off court personality dudes hilarious, plus he brings amazing attitude"
"If you have to bet on a rim-running center that relies on his athleticism to play defense and can‚Äôt score 1 on 1 to play well past 30, you would bet against it. Dwight Howard and Tyson Chandler are the exception."
"I remember when Dwight Howard was requesting to be traded out of Orlando, the rumors were that Adidas was [fueling the trade request, according to Woj](https://sports.yahoo.com/aw-wojnarowski_dwight_howard_magic_nets_trade_031312.html). Interesting to see what true pull these sneaker companies have."
"Although they became teammates, Lebron and Lance Stephenson talking about their playoff battles (unless they already talked about in LA). On a similar note, Lebron and Joakim Noah  Zach Randolph and Blake Griffin  Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard  Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and, Russell Westbrook, to get the real scoop"
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs 100% on his injuries, it‚Äôs just his time away from being on the floor has made people feel he‚Äôs replaceable. Some guys get hurt, everything falls apart, &amp; their team waits patiently for them to come back. Boogie before the Achilles was averaging somewhere around 25/10/5, he gets hurt, &amp; New Orleans still makes the Playoffs. He sits 65-70% of the following season for Golden State, they‚Äôre still an amazing team. He returns and averages 16/8, but gets hurt &amp; they make the Finals without him. The trend continues with the Lakers, he gets hurt, they replace him with Dwight Howard and they win the championship. He‚Äôs still an extremely talented big man like he was in Sacramento but he has one of the highest usage rates in league history &amp; it never translated to wins. Not only do you not have to build your team around him, you don‚Äôt really even need him on your team. If he dedicated himself to being a better defender, it will bring more court time, &amp; allow for more opportunities to flash his skills on offense. Until he does this, nobody is going to sign him to dominate the ball as some kinda pseudo Scoring Point Center like he did previously."
Our D was good tonight - Dwight Howard
"Lebron   Derrick Rose  Joakim Noah  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul  Kemba Walker  Paul Pierce  Z Ilgauskas, the Cavs guy   Horace Grant  Vlade Divac  Jason Richardson  Dwight Howard  Please no one ask why I came up with these, I totally have no idea"
"Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge (maybe) will be split among 2 teams."
"&gt; All time blocks, 3830 Hakeem Olajuwon. Closets player still playing has 2192, Dwight Howard. This is an unbreakable record  The last time I did the calculation (based on pro-rata stats from existing sample of games and in Kareem's case, projecting the numbers to the beginning of his career,) Wilt, Russell and Kareem almost certainly had more, but they weren't counted.  Others like Mark Eaton  had higher rate stats but not the longevity to overhaul hakeem"
"If this sub can meme something they'll run it to the ground, regardless of how verifiable it is.  Reminds me of the Dwight Howard saga 3 years ago."
Lebron in 2009 averaged almost a 40 point triple double against the Magic lmao even with that bad game 6. Dwight Howard is one of the best rim protectors of all time having a bad game does not mean he quit  Same for 2011. Probably the worst choke by a ATG in history given the context but still he didn't exactly quit
Good list. Dwight Howard should be a few spots higher
Dwight Howard needs to be higher than some of those people after him but good list still
Dwight Howard also had a plan then later impregnated a bunch of strippers
"They wanted to win but they couldn't depend on Kobe to dominate a smaller Iverson or a old ass Reggie Miller? You really out there bro. Shaq matchups weren't easy because they were pushovers they were easy cause Shaq was just that damn dominate. If we're putting it your way the Kobe only won FMVP cause he was Tony Allen and Rafer Alston while Pau and Bynum had the harder matchups against Dwight Howard, Kevin Garnett and Perkins"
He played terribly on both ends you absolute stan.  Shooting at -10% true shooting in the first round to the *defensive juggernaut* Portland while Dwight Howard puts up a much more efficient 26/14/2/1/3 is like the definition of a choke. He was supposed to be the best player on the court and he was the 4th best that series.
"1st and 2nd year players rarely help you win in the NBA, let alone in the playoffs. Of course you wouldn‚Äôt trade Wiseman for say, Dwight Howard, but if the Warriors and Lakers play a series, those 12 minutes a game from Howard are likely to hurt the Lakers less than Wiseman would hurt GSW. Same with say Ellington and Moody.  It‚Äôs seems the idea is to truly compete in 22-23, which may be prudent, but if Steph falls off a bit or Draymond can‚Äôt defend at that level anymore, then it won‚Äôt matter."
"I'll take my downvotes because too many of fellow Laker faithful are optimistic sheep and I've posted this point before:   These ""all star lineups"" don't work when they're all old and passed their prime. We did it twice before with kobe in his prime, shaq clutching to his prime, with old man GP and Malone and lost badly. We tried this again with Mamba Kobe, Pau, Dwight in his prime, and old man Nash it didn't work.   It doesn't work. I know Lebron is a freak athlete, but Russ isn't the right fit for this club, AD's body is always a question, Melo/Rondo/Howard/Ariza are all old as shit. THT, Nunn, and Monk better ball the hell out."
And Simmons is flat out incapable of fitting with most backup centers (as they can‚Äôt shoot) and needed them to overpay for him so that non-Embiid Simmons lineups weren‚Äôt a disaster.  Something we saw this year with Simmons unable to create offense with Dwight Howard on the floor
"If Embiid ever got in shape he could do it. Giannis so DPOY and still scored a lot. So has classic big men like Olajuwon and Olajuwon. Shoot Dwight Howard won it 3 years in a row while scoring.   If Embiid hasn‚Äôt gotten into shape by now, he never will."
"He was a good post defender, no he was not one of the best. You are massively overrating him.   Yeah post defence was more important back then but he only as good as he was because he had Garnett as his help defender, later Ibaka in OKC. He could do alright on strong post players but he wasn't stopping the likes of Dwight Howard (basically the only real centre threat at the time) because he can't move his feet in the pick and roll.   The strength of the post in that era is also overstated, most true centres were already on the way out. Shaq was done and most of the rest of the good post players had a jumper to pull guys away from the rim (Gasol, Duncan, Garnett, Nowitzki, Stoudemire).  Bynum played 15 minutes in game 6 (when Perkins got injured) and 18 in game 7. Again Perkins was not a help defender, and was not mobile enough to check Gasol. So what exactly did they miss if he wasn't bodying up Bynum?"
This was pre-MDA. A big like Kevin McHale wasn't going to replace Dwight Howard
"Gallo and Bogi were both pretty big FA acquisitions last year. And even though he ended up sucking for us, Dwight Howard was a massive signing for the Hawks at the time. The Braves have also made some major signings."
"By the time Dwight Howard was Ben Simmons' age he has had multiple DPOY titles, multiple all defense teams, multiple all nba teams, multiple all stars, and has been to the finals already and was the clear cut best big in the game and an arguable top 5 player. He was already a first-ballot HOF player by the end of his age-25 season."
"I think Dwight Howard would've been a good answer like 5 years ago, but it seems like his public image in the league and among fanbase gave somewhat lightened up on him.  I imagine Magic fans may still dislike him, and I don't think he spent enough time in Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, or Philadelphia to be too disliked there"
"&gt;Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown chose numbers 37 and 38, most likely in an attempt to make Dwight Howard not look so fucking stupid by wearing number 39. Conclusion: Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown are AMAZING teammates.  Rofl but for real what did Dwight bribe them with?"
Howard definitely had an MVP caliber season. Giannis is better but not by far. Dwight was probably the #2 player in the league behind LeBron in 2009
Peak Dwight Howard is exponentially better than Simmons. Delete this.
And Demarcus Cousins would've been Dwight Howard
This is the soap opera level type drama I come here for. Love the dwight howard redemption arc.
&gt;most likely in an attempt to make Dwight Howard not look so fucking stupid by wearing number 39.  Lmfaoooo
"Giannis is one of the best help defenders of all time, and he is really switchable, but holy shit Dwight was incredible during his Orlando prime days. As a defensive anchor, Howard just has to be the pick here"
Justice for Dwight Howard !!!!
"See, this is what happens when reporters are too eager for a scoop: reputations are ruined, in an instant, just like that.  Dwight Howard will probably be suing you for libel very soon."
"&gt; He absolutely did not have a better shooting touch than Shaq, though.   One of his signature moves was a midrange fadeaway, and another was a finger roll.  All the video you see of him playing bully ball are from the end of his career, when officiating had changed and it was no longer an automatic foul if the offensive player initiated contact with a defender.    &gt;I don't know what people see when they watch clips of him offensively. I see a guy who's crazy gifted athletically dominating guys who aren't.  He'd still be dominating people athletically, just as Shaq was able to do.   It's not like a dude who was athletic enough to be a track star at 7'+ couldn't hang in today's NBA.  He was the same size as Shaq and could run faster and jump higher, and do it for longer periods of time.  I have a hard time understanding how anyone could think he wouldn't dominate the league today.   Or do you think Shaq would just be a ""slightly better dwight howard"" today too?"
Which version of Blake Griffin are we using here? You specified that we are using the peak version of Dwight Howard for this but didn‚Äôt specify with Blake.
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
"&gt;His early years are overrated (tons of points against scrubs and never won anything) and his late years are overrated. His offensive game was nothing special and once there were better defenders on every team, he couldn't just dump the ball in over everyone but Russell.   He played against Bellamy, Reed, Thurmond, Lucas, Unseld, Cowens, Kareem, Hayes, etc.  Because the league was small every contending team had a legitimately elite big for pretty much his entire career.  Basically the exact opposite of today, where there are a tiny handful of competent bigs and a ton of teams with nothing but filler bodies down low.   Also, lol at the ""his offensive game was nothing special"".   He had a sick fadeaway and great touch around the rim, and consistently scored with efficiency far above his peers.  All with the rules preventing him from abusing his physical advantages on offense.  If he could have thrown his weight around like Shaq he would have been even more absurdly unstoppable than he already was.    &gt;He would be a better version of Dwight Howard in today's game.  He was a much better shooter and passer and literally everything else in comparison to Dwight, wtf are you talking about?  He couldn't even use his physicality on offense for his highest scoring seasons, because contact was always called in the defenders' favor in that era.    His floor is basically Shaq.  He was as big and strong while being faster and with better endurance, had a better shooting touch, and was a better defender."
I don't think Dwight Howard is vaccinated?
"no mention of Dwight Howard or PG13, incredible."
Have you ever seen Simmons and Dwight Howard share the court?  Yeah they he's a bad fit with Holmes.  2 non-shooters is 1 too many in the NBA now
"League was going into a lockout, Cuban didn't want to lock up anyone beyond a year because of that uncertainty plus several big stars being free agents. Mavs had the ability to get both Howard and Paul, and some signals that both wanted to play together and Dallas was an option - so Cuban offered Chandler a big 1 year deal (20 million i think?) but it was Chandler's first big contract and he deserved a long term one and got it with NY. Dwight waffles in Orlando, CP3 ends up getting traded to Lakes then nullified and ends up with Clips."
Imagine the eradicated ones coming back like small pox coz of morons like Bradley Beal and Dwight Howard.
"His early years are overrated (tons of points against scrubs and never won anything) and his late years are overrated. His offensive game was nothing special and once there were better defenders on every team, he couldn't just dump the ball in over everyone but Russell. He would be a better version of Dwight Howard in today's game."
"‚ÄúBut this violates my HIPAA law!!‚Äù  - Dwight Howard, probably"
"That's pretty awesome, and also kind of weird that this was also a Dwight Howard team."
"Duncan, Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  He's 4th at best."
"Ugh. Rivers has to take like half the blame on this situation. Ben is who he is. Obviously flawed yet talented as fuck player.    Rivers played him with Dwight Howard. That's 2 absolute non-shooters sharing the floor in the year of 2021. Now he's saying he would play Ben as a C. Too litte too late, like in every single one of your 3-1 losses.   God I hate Doc. Sucks as a coach and just gets by thanks to Bostons Big 3."
"2004-2005 Orlando Magic (Dwight's rookie year) was the same, with Grant Hill as the non-team player:  1 Doug Christie  2 Stacey Augmon  3 Steve Francis  4 Tony Battie  5 Cuttino Mobley  6 Retired for the fans (lol)  7 Mark Jones  8 Pat Garrity  9 DeShawn Stevenson  11 Andre Barrett  12 Dwight Howard  13 Kelvin Cato  14 Jameer Nelson  15 Hedo T√ºrkoƒülu  33 Grant Hill"
"sorry, D-Wade &gt; Iverson  06' championship proves that already  &amp;#x200B;  Also, Dwight Howard &gt; A'mare, by a lot"
"That‚Äôs because Dwight accepts his role and knows his place... Drummond is like 2.5 years removed from being the number 1 option, starting center,  all star. The lakers were starting him this year   Dwight knows his place on a team and what to do. I love Howard but he‚Äôs a bench role player at this point. Drummond is an amazing back up big off the bench especially for the minimum. And on a team where there‚Äôs no way in hell he would be starting over Joel"
Dwight Howard come to milwaukee is still my favorite
Dwight Howard has had a HOF career. I doubt he likes being #14 on the team. Makes it seem like he‚Äôs not important anymore.
"I encourage everyone to listen to [this Matt Sullivan interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhXUETyCkVM) with Dan. He mentions that yes, the players have gotten vaccinated but a lot of them are skeptical of it and Kyrie being VP reflects that. That Dwight Howard quote is god damn insane but he's the fun guy."
"It's also about covering the story, not becoming the story. They are there to report on what Dwight is saying, not to argue with him. This snippet is a prime example. The story isn't Dwight Howard not knowing what the hipaa is, it's ""Dwight Howard gets DESTROYED by reporter with FACTS and LOGIC"""
"Oh shit I didn't even realize that. So if Dwight Howard (and Andre Drummond, to be fair) were never born, maybe Gasol is still on the squad and the Lakers have perfect numerical harmony."
"HIPPA Law:  ""Dwight Howard out tonight with back spasms. This medical report is brought to you by DraftKings."""
"Well, for once Dwight Howard isn't one of the guys fighting vaccination... I mean, he's kinda the first guy other than Kyrie that comes to mind that would fight this"
**BREAKING NEWS:** Dwight Howard is not very smart. More at 11.
"""Dwight Howard is out for 4 games due to right ankle sprain""  Dwight Howard: HIPAA?!?!?!!"
Dwight Howard shoulders
Dwight Howard can read?!?
Well considering Dwight went to Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy which is well known in the are for its  low standards; I can almost guarantee Howard has less than a high school education.
Dwight Howard being Dwight Howard a tale as old as time
"Regarding HIPAA, here's an easy example if it's HIPAA related or not.   Dwight Howard is free to speak about his medical conditions until the cows come home.  A reporter is free to ask Dwight Howard about his medical conditions until the cows come home.  Reporters cannot access his medical files or ""convince"" personnel to alert them of what's on his file - that is a HIPAA violation.   On a day-to-day basis when I worked in a hospital the biggest ""violation"" was passwords being visible. There were so many safeguards in place audit wise (stopped working in 2015) that it was easy to lose your job looking at a patient file that wasn't related to your job responsibilities. The EHR system used would send alerts regarding suspicion! Have fun describing why you were looking at someone's records...."
It sounds like he wants the Dwight Howard Orlando Magic set up with 4 shooters around him.  But he‚Äôs not good in the post and he wants to be the PG and have the ball in his hands.  He also doesn‚Äôt drive as aggressively as he should.  This would probably be easier if he just expanded his game.  I‚Äôm curious to see what his career ends up being.
"&gt; Dwight Howard on a change of heart on vaccines: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a lot of opinions on that, but I‚Äôm going to keep that private. **HIPPA** Law.‚Äù  &gt; Reporter tells Howard, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what HIPAA is, but OK.""  FTFY."
Dwight Howard barely has a high school education. He's pretty much the last athlete I expect to have a nuanced take on this
What makes it even crazier is he easily flushed it down. It‚Äôs not like the Dwight Howard dunk where he had to throw it in because he came up short. Zion slapped his palm on the rim so could‚Äôve jumped a couple inches earlier and he still would‚Äôve made it
"Ah yes, Dwight Howard, the NBA's resident expert on HIPAA privacy and patient confidentiality rights."
Sounds like Dwight Howard has been reading a lot of misinformation..
"Am I the only one who thinks it‚Äôs weird that we are demanding pro athletes answer for this. Like I want every one to be vaccinated but there‚Äôs 400 million people in this country. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs statically possible even though we should strive for it  I guess the problem is putting athletes on this pedestal but that‚Äôs just how society is. Dwight Howard is a basketball player, he should be answering basketball questions. Ok go ahead and flame me"
The Sixers' backup point guards in this span were Raul Neto and a rookie Tyrese Maxey. Their backup centers were Al Horford and Dwight Howard.
almost like.. Dwight Howard Orlando Magic
Because Simmons doesn‚Äôt shoot he doesn‚Äôt fit with the majority of NBA centers so he couldn‚Äôt play with Dwight Howard.  They were just not offensively palatable.  That‚Äôs why his minutes were linked with Embiid.
"KAT is def too low and Dwight, Irving, Rose too high  I‚Äôd say  LeBron Davis Zion Oden Yao KAT Wall Griffin Rose Simmons Cunningham Wiggins Irving Bogut Brown Howard Edward‚Äôs Martin Barg Bennett"
Dwight Howard when he's throwing his massive shoulders around inadvertently and gets like 3 fouls in 2 minutes.
"I mean who of significance has signed in NY, LA, or Miami in the last decade though? Lebron, kawhi, KD/Kyrie, and butler? If you‚Äôre counting Dwight Howard, harden, Paul George, etc getting traded to those cities as those markets getting all the players, then there‚Äôs plenty of great players that got traded to markets other than those. PG resigned with the small market thunder before wanting out. Chris Paul got traded to the rockets thunder and Suns and resigned there. Jimmy butler got traded to the timberwolves and left because they wouldn‚Äôt pay him. Then he got traded to the sixers and left because they wouldn‚Äôt pay him. The Spurs signed lamarcus Aldridge in FA, who chose them specifically over the lakers.   People whining about how their specific team hasn‚Äôt gotten a top 10-20 player in FA need to understand that there‚Äôs not a lot of those players and they aren‚Äôt often free agents. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to get top level players, and whining about big markets while simultaneously being a top 5 market is genuinely hilarious."
"Right but he‚Äôs playing either way, so the difference would be someone like Dwight Howard versus Bazemore, who is smaller."
Hmmm...anyone ask Dwight Howard what his status is?
because he‚Äôs a big body and Dwight Howard can‚Äôt play 30 minutes a game
"Probably something elaborately stupid that he will walk back months later as a sheepish joke. Has there ever been a more talented boob in NBA history? Gilbert Arenas comes to mind, and of course Dwight Howard."
"Lebron the player is great and the biggest reason by far that James' teams have been successful.  Trading Hart, Lonzo, Ingram, the fourth pick and two other firsts for a guy with one year left under contract who would only play for you was not a master stroke.    KCP, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, McGee and Rondo were fine but if you take Lebron the player out of the equation that's just a shittier version of those Pelicans teams who won one playoff series in 7 years."
"That shit was the biggest blueballing ever.   That's exactly what happened and the Magic released a Dwight Howard t-shirt captioned [""Loyalty""](https://sports.cbsimg.net/images/visual/whatshot/6512_Loyalty.jpg) when he opted in."
Tbh my favorite part is how Shaq has a fun time dancing with his best friend Dwight Howard.
"Ben and Joel had a +17.7 net rating as a duo in the playoffs last season, and in the 2018-19 playoffs (Ben was hurt for 2019-20), they had a +20.0.   The problem has literally never been the on court fit between Ben and Joel, they and the starters as a whole have always pulled their weight.   The problems start when one or both of them comes off the floor. Our backups PGs have been TJ McConnell and a rookie Tyrese Maxey. Our backups centers have been Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe, Boban, and a 35 year old Dwight Howard. That‚Äôs where 90% of our problems have stemmed from."
"He was right about a lot of stuff: this, Dwight Howard being soft, the AAU, LeBron's headband, etc."
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
Just give me Prime Dwight Howard with Steph curry handles and shooting.  Time to buy that Wenbayama stock.
True‚Ä¶I think a more accurate Dwight Howard draft comparison would be Alonzo Mourning.
I love the relationship between Shaq and his best friend Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard &amp;Javale McGee might have a few choice words for him
"While I don't agree with the take, that's well explained/reasoned.  With Trae I would be interested seeing him on a different defensive role in future. In fact I would argue it's extremely likely that it will happen given that situation allows for it.  That would follow the trend with some other short (or relatively short) guards like Lowry, Curry and Paul who all started their career trying to defend point of attack and then transitioned to either helpers or chasers later on. With young being worst PoA defender in NBA by large margin I'd expect that change sooner rather than later.  With Jokic I'm not totally convinced that he's all that doomed. He had particularly bad year defensively 20-21. However before that he had 3 years where he was much better defensively and 15-16 season he was actually one of the better centers defensively (within top 10 or so).  To me the fact that his defense suffered a bit while he basically doubled his offensive effectiveness is more than understandable. His offensive responsibilities will always be limiting factors for his defense in future and I don't think we will ever see defensive performance like 15-16 from him again, but I think 17-18 type of performance would be very manageable and if he can do that with the type of offensive output he showed last season I think that would be enough. It would basically put him as slightly above average center defender in his defensive role. So along guys like Steven Adams and Dwight Howard for example."
Dwight Howard attempted more 3s last season than Ben did. Not even joking lol
Lakers (guessing their starting 5)  Russell Westbrook (Rajon Rondo) Malik Monk (Lou Williams) LeBron James (Magic Johnson)  Anthony Davis (Kevin Garnett)  Dwight Howard (N/A)
Dwight Howard bringing back his signature design double arm sleeves.
It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me why he doesn‚Äôt want to. I mean shit even Dwight Howard wants to shoot 3s. He needs a sports psychiatrist or something
"Ah yes, the ""sign as many big bodies as we can in the desperate hope that one of them will be able to slow down Dwight Howard"" era. Jason Collins, Etan Thomas, Erick Dampier... good times."
"He averaged like 35/9/7 in the series they were eliminated. Being the best athlete since Wilt made up for most of his holes. His biggest hole was having a center that couldnt guard Dwight Howard, and not dominating pace like he does now"
One difference is that Dwight was a hell of a lot better than Simmons and Philly still have a better player. Still a sticky situation but not as desperate for the team as the Howard situation was for Orlando.
"There are going to be snubs who are better than the players on your list. Here‚Äôs a quick list of the top of my head of 30 players in the last 25 years, and some will not make it.   LeBron, Duncan, Kobe, KD, Steph, Giannis, Wade, Dirk, Nash, CP3, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Allen Iverson, Kawhi, Harden, Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Melo, AD, Tony Parker, Manu, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady, Pau Gasol, Dikembe Mutombo, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Yao.   I didn‚Äôt even include the newer players like Jokic, Dame, or George.   Then add some of the older snubs like McAdoo, Dominique, Rodman, and English, you have an overflow of players."
"Colangelo should've had the balls to reconsider after Fultz had his workout in Philly where he bricked every single jumper. Dwight Howard can splash open 3s all day in practice, when Fultz couldn't do that it was a red flag."
Dwight Howard
Dwight Howard for the Lakers
"Here's my list, including bubble players  Should be guaranteed (retirees listed first)  * Tim Duncan * Kobe Bryant * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Jason Kidd * Allen Iverson * Paul Pierce * Ray Allen * Gary Payton * LeBron James * Kevin Durant * Steph Curry * Chris Paul * James Harden  Would be surprised if they didn't make it  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (not in the highest tier only because of age) * Kawhi Leonard * Dwight Howard * Russell Westbrook  I think should make it  * Dominique Wilkins * Reggie Miller * Dennis Rodman * Bob McAdoo  Youngest active player to consider  * Nikola Jokic (in the league for 6 seasons and has an MVP. Shaq only was in the league for 4 seasons before the top 50 list)  My Bubble  * Tracy McGrady * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Tony Parker * Dikembe Mutombo * Anthony Davis * Chris Bosh * Manu Ginobili * Chris Mullin * Chauncey Billups * Ben Wallace * Adrian Dantley * Alex English * Carmelo Anthony  Reggie Miller Group (active veteran players not good enough for this anniversary list, but might be good enough in 25 years after a full career)  * Damian Lillard * Draymond Green * Kyle Lowry * Paul George * Jimmy Butler * Klay Thompson"
Julius gets better with every kid he has. Imagine if he was on Dwight Howard levels... he'd become the GOAT.
I mean my all time favorite saga on this sub was about Dwight Howard liking it up his butt. This is par for the course for r/nba in terms of journalistic integrity.
"I was looking at [ESPN's top 74](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/29105574/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-74-41) recently.   Damian Lillard was 72 and I think that's a pretty decent benchmark. Dame being right on the edge of making the list sets the stage for a lot of current players missing out.   The other borderline guy I liked was Mutumbo. With 8 All-Stars and 4 DPOYs and still only being borderline, it sets a decent precedent for guys like Rudy Gobert, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard."
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
"Dirk had a potential DPOY, former aging all star, and a rising star.   That would equate to: Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, DeAndre Hunter.   Everyone else would be role players."
No Dwight Howard on the other team so I'd just expect a tech
"Nah I think you're giving him way too much credit. Dude has the attitude of a fucking toddler. If his feelings were that hurt that he was willing to hold this season hostage by now showing up, I'm sure playing like shit so he gets benched but still played definitely crossed his mind. Of course all that does is holds up trade talks and ruins his value, but I don't think he gives a fuck. He's getting paid either way, whether he plays, gets traded, or benched. And we all seen what happens when a star player wants out and will do whatever it takes to get it i.e Anthony Davis, James Harden, Dwight Howard.  &gt;'m sure the relentless shit talk from opposing teams could have an impact as well, making him angry.  Shit talk him for what? I mean people like to pretend the NBA is some kind of deep brotherhood. It's one thing with the media and the fans shit on you or turn on you, but for your OWN players and coaches to throw you under the bus like that? Honestly he didn't handle this like a professional at all, but I completely understand where he's coming from. Those are 2 people who are supposed to be on your side no matter what, regardless of how bad he played, they pretty much threw him under the bus."
"This is the absolute wrong takeaway from that season, like blatantly false. Kobe didn't play that way because of MDA, Kobe played that way to close out the year specifically because MDA wasn't utilizing our team to its full potential.   The whole of the first half of that season came down to us making adjustments and waiting on Steve Nash to come back from injury to get our system right. Just about every post-game conference with our early struggles was MDA pushing the buck, just wait till Nash comes back, we'll figure it out, etc. He refused to make any adjustments for the longest time all the while force-feeding looks to Dwight Howard in the post and relegating Pau Gasol to being a stretch 4. It was abysmal basketball being played and Kobe mostly went along with it for the early part of the season but was clearly over it by January.   The only reason why we were even in the playoff race later that year was due to Kobe explicitly NOT listening to him and taking over the offense on his own as the primary facilitator the 2nd half of the season. This wasn't some ingenious innovation ala MDA; this was Kobe saying fuck all to what we were doing and just willing us to wins post ASW. There was no system being run. We weren't running any schemes to free up players or generate new looks. We literally just reverted to Kobe/Pau PnR to generate looks and used their combo as the primary means of generating offense for everyone else when they were out there together.   Kobe literally averaged like 43+ MPG the final ten games of the season trying to will us to the postseason, some of them resting for only a minute or two, before his body just completely gave out. MDA was absolute trash as a coach that year, let's not give him praise for ""success"" that he wasn't responsible for a decade later."
The 2009 Magic was literally the only team that Dwight Howard played on in his entire career that had the #1 Defensive Rating in the league.
"It would take longer to list the ones he is better than over the reverse. Shit Cody Zeller is better than him and our bench isn‚Äôt even good.   Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Zubac, kanter, Zeller, Dwight Howard all better just off the top of my head and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting some"
"He literally took Dwight Howard and a bunch of spot-up shooters and negative defenders to multiple 59-win seasons, the #1 defense in the league and the NBA Finals."
"Depth can be gotten easily.  Guys like Jrue Holiday, Cameron Payne, Jae Crowder, Booby Portis, Brook Lopez who make the rest of the roster of championship level teams are traded, waived, or developed all the time.  Lakers won a championship with Caruso starting game 6, with guys like Rondo and Dwight Howard filling major roles on the team.    Philly should have said ""Take anything from our team except Embiid"" for Harden, and then built around those two."
"He's right about the Dwight Howard elbows. He does that, then gives the Tim Duncan ""what did I do look"" every time."
"Yeah, they had really horrendous chemistry issues in the former half of the season. Gasol and Howard didnt look like they really bought into the offensive system. But it looked like begrudgingly, changes were made on MDA‚Äôs end..they were on a roll after the All-Star break so it looked like they had finally figured it out.  Then, Kobe went down. And injuries piled up. By the time the playoffs had come around, Goudelock and Morris were starting for them. Who? Yeah exactly lol  I 100% agree with you that much of the Lakers initial woes were with the bigs‚Äô unwillingness to buy into MDA‚Äôs system but what ultimately killed that Lakers season was the fact that all of their ‚ÄúBig 4‚Äù was injured. Gasol missed half the season over some plantar fasciitis thing IIRC. Nash broke his foot or something early on. As you mentioned, Howard was just playing through a bad back and wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to Orlando Dwight. and Kobe, well we know what happened there‚Ä¶  It was a shame for me as an NBA fan because there was huge hype for a Kobe-LeBron finals in the offseason"
"If you are saying Luka plays in a significantly more Heliocentric offence you are lying.   Luka is one of (if not the most) ball dominate players in the league.   A heliocentric offence is what the run in Denver.  And no, im saying having Luka over Dwight Howard is wrong. Im pointing out that your logic for Luka is the same logic for Trae, you just only apply it for Luka. That‚Äôs why your logic doesn‚Äôt make sense."
He definitely doesn't deserve to be over guys like Dwight Howard like someone else pointed out in here. Luka hasn't gotten out of the 1st round yet.
"These list are usually trash.   Comparing peaks of players and doing it to 75? Like doing a top 10 peaks is possible, b it is there really much variation between the 60th best peak and the 45th best peak.   It‚Äôs also not really saying why they chose the players where the are, however however Luka Doncic over Dwight Howard is pretty crazy. Peak Dwight took him team to the finals, peak Luka hasn‚Äôt gotten out of round 1 yet. I think Luka will have a great peak, but people need to cool the jets on a 22 year old."
"Are you crazy, you throw Dwight Howard on that team they win in like 5 games."
Dwight Howard has entered the chat.
I just don't think that the best solution to it is running lineups with Ben Simmons and Dwight Howard on the court at the same time. Especially in a do or die game 7.
Throw prime Dwight Howard on the Suns last season and they take the Bucks from 6 games to 7 with a chance to win it. Man averaged 20 pts   On 63 TS% and 15 rebounds with all time defense while leading his team to the finals.
"Glenn Rivers peaked in 2008, an era where you could build a contender around Dwight Howard"
I mean his argument isnt helping Russ tbh. In his own words he last had consistent good season 5 years ago - that is like year removed of Dwight Howard still being considered a star.
a dude named Bjelica had Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis in their feelings lol i canttt
"Kobe paired with a very old Steve Nash who got injured three games in and a Dwight Howard fresh off a back surgery. Paired with coach D'antoni, it was a team of superstars that just didn't work together.   Just getting the same vibes from this team. Too early to tell, though."
It‚Äôs gonna be like that one interview with Dwight and SVG        https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2018/6/15/17467794/dwight-howard-stan-van-gundy-orlando-magic
Should be guaranteed (retirees listed first)  * Tim Duncan * Kobe Bryant * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Jason Kidd * Allen Iverson * Paul Pierce * Ray Allen * Gary Payton * LeBron James * Kevin Durant * Steph Curry * Chris Paul * James Harden  Would be surprised if they didn't make it  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (not in the highest tier only because of age) * Kawhi Leonard * Dwight Howard * Russell Westbrook  I think should make it  * Dominique Wilkins * Reggie Miller * Dennis Rodman * Bob McAdoo  Youngest active player to consider  * Nikola Jokic (in the league for 6 seasons and has an MVP. Shaq only was in the league for 4 seasons before the top 50 list)  My Bubble  * Tracy McGrady * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Tony Parker * Dikembe Mutombo * Anthony Davis * Chris Bosh * Manu Ginobili
i stand strongly by my idea to trade him for dwight howard
"In no order:   LeBron  Kobe  Duncan  KD  Steph  Dwyane Wade  Chris Paul  Steve Nash  Dwight Howard  Harden  Giannis(idk if they will but 2 MVPs and 1 FMVP is already better than a lot of these guys, so he should)  Kawhi  Dirk  KG  Carmelo  Pierce  Jason Kidd  Gary Payton  Ray Allen  Dominique Wilkins(he's not in here yet but they might add him)  Reggie Miller  Vince Carter  Iverson  Anthony Davis  Westbrook"
Compared to Dwight Howard he's a legit savant.  Love Dwight and what he did for the team last year but my god was he frustrating at times
"Drummond has impressed me in the pre-season. Of course, it‚Äôs not difficult to look smarter than Dwight Howard and Greg Monroe, et al."
Dwight Howard is a lock. Where is he?
"There was already a pretty good nba player who shot underhandedly and he was among the best ft shooters of all time, if not the very best.  There have been studies saying underhand shooting is ‚Äúscientifically‚Äù better.  But I think they are very inaccurate studies as they are based on the assumption that a player can be as accurate under handed as they are over handed.    If Shaq did it I think you would see bigs do it if they shoot really bad like Dwight Howard.  And maybe we‚Äôd see a few more shooters who struggle at the  FT line in high 60‚Äôs low 70‚Äôs try it, but I doubt it‚Äôd become universal.  Guys like steph curry Seth curry aren‚Äôt changing from their 90%+ overhand free throws no matter how many other players do it.  I think for bigs who don‚Äôt take jumpers anyway, or even guys like Ben Simmons who don‚Äôt take jumpers, it could make sense.  Going to the ft line cold either way if you don‚Äôt take jumpers in game."
I saw Dwight Howard in kekes breakfast cafe when I was like 6. Huge person.
"Exactly right.  Back in 2010 I had won a contest where a friend and I got flown out to Atlanta to an Adidas World Cup Party hosted by Dwight Howard.  There were literally only about 20 fans there total.   For two hours we all got to spend time with him.  I literally spent a good 20 mins sitting next to him side-by-side on a couch talking to him about comic books lol.  He was in a whole new world, it was great."
Someone post this the other day apparently the answer is Dwight Howard or David Robinson absolutely ridiculous
"Remember when Stan Van Gundy and Dwight Howard gave that awkward ass interview saying they didn't hate each other, I think this is going to be worse haha"
"Dwight Howard is definitely aging a lot better than expected. Even though he‚Äôs not the athletic freak he once was, he‚Äôs still a great athlete at his age"
Enjoy Dwight Howard
"Yeah, why didn't Dwight Fucking Howard accept to be bench grunt #17 for the bumass Hornets, Wizards, Hawks or Nets teams.      Inb4 ""I'm actually talking about when Kobe and Nash wanted to play him like Javale McGee"". Yeah I doubt that's why Lakers signed an all star, all NBA superstar averaging 20ppg mostly on postups and earning 20M a year.     Hate this damn narrative. Respect DWIGHT HOWARD damnit."
Dwight Howard has aged surprisingly well
Kyrie and Dwight Howard
"Yeah, doesn‚Äôt anyone remember when the Lakeshow put together the dream team of Kobe, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard, and Pau Gasol! They lost 4 preseason games but ended up winning the chip! Oh wait... lol"
Dwight Howard is ranked 16 spots ahead of Wade  Who the fuck made this list
Dwight Howard at 47 LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL WTF
"upvote this a million times if i could. the nets have enough ball-handling and 3pt shooting everywhere, they NEED a 1-5 defender like Simmons. Blake Griffin will get injured. play Simmons like Dwight friggin Howard but can handle the ball and pass better."
Dwight Howard
How the hell did Dwight Howard make it in?
"Cuban will never be more than a 5 until he stops having final say over personnel decisions. It was clear during their GM search this offseason that he was never going after someone like Masai who demands autonomy over roster moves. He created such a toxic front office structure that resulted in opposing GMs not knowing who had final say on trades within the organization. He let a shadow-GM who made his money as a gambler select Josh Green over Saddiq Bey in the 2020 draft, the last top 20 pick the Mavs will have in the Luka era. And none of this would have changed without the Tim Cato story - which Cuban called ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù before he totally cleaned house.  I‚Äôm not even going to get into the late Dirk prime years where we were constantly being embarrassed by the Dwight Howard/Deandre Jordan chases when we could have just re-signed Tyson Chandler. Chandler Parsons was our go to Free Agent recruiter.   He did a lot of good early on by focusing on international scouting, but I‚Äôm just over the facade of Mark Cuban as trailblazing owner."
Dwight Howard over Dwayne Wade...Crazy
Kg being below Dwight Howard made me more mad than it probably should have.
Or Dwight Howard
um  so i'd never seen that dunk at #7  he just straight up murders dwight howard  how is this dunk not posted more often lmao
Dwight Howard ranking üòÇüòÇ
Dwight Howard over Kevin Garnett LMAO
"I'm surprised you didn't already drown yourself in liquor after seeing Westbrook, Draymond, Dwight Howard, and Damian Lillard over Wade."
dwight howard being above dwyane wade haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHAAAAAAA
They got Dwight Howard over him
Dwight Howard over D Wade?
Dwight Howard over Kevin Garnett lol
"Dwight Howard at 47 over Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnet, and Dwayne Wade at 52, 54, and 62 respectively is underrated.   Dennis Rodman at 18 stands out as maybe the most egregious thing on the list. Jason Kidd at 29 is pretty close though."
Dwight Howard over Ewing‚Ä¶
Lmfao Dwight Howard
Let alone Dwight Howard being above Kawhi
"Can we please get an above average C? Aside from one magical year from Al Jefferson, we haven't had a top 15 center since Emeka Okafor... Maybe Dwight Howard depending on your perception of his impact"
The David Robinson argument is a joke  By that logic Dwight Howard would be a good option üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Start Ben Wallace  Bench Rudy Gobert  Cut Dwight Howard  &amp;#x200B;  It's really close, and I'm not objective, but all 3 are basically at the same level as rim protectors/help defenders, Ben was a slightly better perimeter defender than Rudy and Dwight IMO"
"Start Dwight Howard, bench Wallace, cut Gobert."
Dwight Howard does personalized greetings for $200. He's not gonna cuck some dude for $5K?
"lol Duncan got drafted to perennial second round team as the first pick.  even though they had an injury year, they were still a top 10-15 team in the league.  Imagine adding the #1 pick to that. Of course they were going to win. You can thank RC Buford and the entire spurs organization.  If Kawhi never played the bitch, they would still be contenders till this day.  You give way more credit to Tim Duncan than is actually justified.  By the way, Kobe was able to get Chris Paul, but you know how that turned out. mfin ""basketball reasons""  so yes, he was able to attract a top 20 player, but never got to play with one.  And if Dwight Howard didn't have such a down year in 2013, he'd probably be top 20 as well.  Pau gasol was barely top 20 in the league in 2010, you can see my list below.  Kobe haters are such stupid people honestly."
"Lebron James,¬† Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
The look the ref made after Dwight Howard pushed CP3 on the back is the same exact face I have made at my students when they do something mean and get upset that they're getting a consequence for it.
The look the ref made after Dwight Howard pushed CP3 on the back is the same exact face I have made at my students when they do something mean and get upset that they're getting a consequence for it.
"Dwight Howard came to the league with the maturity of a 13 yo, and he's gonna retire with the maturity of a 12 yo."
"It was a terrible list man... Lillard got selected, but not freaking Tony Parker? C'mon... I tell you this, I had this discussion with friends not so long ago: if the NBA finally moved beyond the jurassic players, only comparing professionals with professionals, then nobody would be snubbed. I respect what Wilt did, Russell, Oscar, West, Mikan, etc.. you name it. But they played a different sport (all of them admitted that, saved by Wilt), they were amateurs. It's simply unfair to put amateurs in perspective with professionals, period. They are already respected and honored by the league, awards named after them, the freaking logo is based on their period... what more do you freaking need? Wilt grabbing 25 rebounds over amateurs can be put in perspective with Dwight Howard grabbing 15 rebounds over professionals? No, they can't, it's illogical"
Lol. Dwight Howard.
"We should have 20 like Boston, Dwight Howard and Vern Mikkelsen should have made the list."
"That's so BM like goddamn, that's Dwight Howard hitting the 3 in the finals level disrespect"
"Dwight Howard, without a doubt."
Man no one was really stopping Lebron from scoring back then. Just like Iggy didn't shut him down in the finals. Lebron is an undisputed top 10 player of all time.  He can be slowed. During this time period Lebron had still not developed the consistent outside game he had now which meant he was forced to contend with Howard in the paint.  As a Magic fan I often liked our odds because Dwight existed.    https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/dwight_howard_vs_lebron_james.htm
"I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm worth your time or not bud you came to my comment not the other way around lmao. And for something that happens to ‚Äúliterally every player‚Äù it sure happens to Gobert a lot more. He‚Äôs overrated as a defender, Dwight Howard would ate him alive in his prime and dawg as Jazz fan yourself the disrespect to Spida Mitchell is crazy cause ya‚Äôll would literally be nothing exciting to talk about if wasn‚Äôt for him."
"For one take off your Pac 10. That means fuck all when it comes to best NBA players ever.  Now here's a list of a bunch of players ahead of Klay who also didnt make it.  Alonzo Mourning, Yao Ming, Pau Gasol, Dikembe Mutombo, Alex English, Tracy McGrady, Tony Parker, Grant Hill, Dwight Howard  I dont think Lillard should be there. But Klay is certainly not the big snub"
Dwight Howard is so disrespected it is unreal. Guy is a first ballot HOF'er and one of the best centres to ever play.
"You are insane. Literally insane. Robinson averaged 30/11/5/2/3 at his peak with DPOY level defense. Ewing did similar (basically didn't have the playmaking ability of Robinson).  There is literally no argument for Howard over either of them, it's laughable.   Who cares about Howard's DPOYs? Dwight Howard would have 0 DPOY in a league with David Robinson or Hakeem Olajuwon. They were that much better than him across the board IMO to the point that it's laughable to compare them.  That being said, Howard definitely was snubbed from the top 75 list."
"‚ÄúGobert level defender‚Äù ü§£ü§£ nah son you didn‚Äôt just compare a real defender like DH12 to that tall doof Gobert. Dwight Howard actually played defense in an era where it was tougher to get a bucket and led his team to the Finals. Check the tape, check the accolades. Gobert has NOTHING on Dwight Howard."
Didn‚Äôt Walton get in and he played like one healthy season.   Dwight Howard was arguably the best player in basketball for five consecutive seasons.  It‚Äôs an atrocity he wasn‚Äôt on the list
"People really think that T-Mac was an all time great just because he was Kobe Bryant lite.  Sure, he has a place in the HOF when the criteria is so relaxed, but he's nowhere close to a guy like Dwight Howard when looking at the best NBA players of all time."
"Guess you forgot about Dwight Howard, Shaq Patrick Ewing, Mutombo, Rodman, Robinson ect‚Ä¶"
"I don‚Äôt know what you meant. Dwight Howard would literally be a nobody in the 90s with the likes of David Robinson, Ewing, Hakeem, Alonzo Mourning etc, and you retorted with Curry would have been on the bench in the 90s a claim you can‚Äôt back up."
It‚Äôs so much more than one game. If you can‚Äôt see it I‚Äôm not going to make you see it. Just like you won‚Äôt be able to make me see your point. Agree to disagree. Dwight Howard is a bum.
Still no love for Dwight Howard lol
"I just saw Shannon Sharpe say Dwight Howard ‚Äúat his peak was better than Patrick Ewing.‚Äù Pat averaged 4 blocks a game one season, and averaged over 3 blocks at least 5x in his career, meanwhile Dwight‚Äôs season high is 2.9. Pat averaged 29 points a game, while Dwight never averaged more than 22.   Pat, in the age of Centers never daring to shoot 3s, would hit deep 2s on regular basis, and had an extensive list of moves to use in the post. Could also take his opponent off the dribble. While Dwight was limited to dunks and tip ins.   I swear some people are just dumb"
People like me like saying stupid shit over the internet just to instigate so I might take you up on that   Dwight Howard is way better fuck outta here goofy
Dwight Howard had Almost no impact during his title year. This can‚Äôt be serious.  You don‚Äôt get credit for just winning a ring. You get credit for role you played in it. Wallace was the anchor to the pistons defense and went head to head with prime Shaq in the finals. The Lakers couldn‚Äôt even afford to give dwight minutes in the finals   I don‚Äôt think either should be on the 75. But I think Wallace is slightly more important for Nba history
Yeah hella people are questioning even Lillard and AD being in there. Even Dwight Howard isn't in there.   I *love* Dray but I think he's not quite in the conversation.
Dwight Howard should easily make that team
"Ya it's kind of lame that they just kept all 50 from the original top 50 IMO. Like is Sam Jones (just to pick an example) really better than, say, Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, TMac, etc.?"
"Dwight howard literally carried the Orlando team to the finals and was an mvp candidate multiple years. Klay not being on the list is not outrageous at all, I'd take prime McGrady over klay anyday and I love klay he's probably in the top 3 in shooting guards before the injury arguably the best. What they should have done is take off some of the older players from the top 50 and added more than 25 that makes no sense."
"It‚Äôs all speculation. Pre injury Klay absolutely could be a number 1 option. There was plenty of times pre-KD when Steph was out that he nearly singlehandedly won games for the Warriors. I hate getting into the comps especially since they played in different eras. If Klay were to ever be added onto a different top 75 list there‚Äôs no way you take out Ray or Reggie to add him in, but maybe they look at some other players who were on the bubble. TBH I feel Dwight Howard was the biggest snub"
"Should be ten active players, including Dwight Howard."
dwight howard is more of a snub imo
Dwight Howard for instance
"Dray/Klay will be more remembered for the GSW era of the 2000's than quite a few other guys on the list.  Dwight Howard probably will be remembered more than Anthony Davis when all is said and done too, and people in the future won't grade off of how they feel about someone's personality, they're going to look at playoff success + accolades and go from there. (Which is where Prime Dwight stacks up much much higher...)"
"Dame Lilliard, Melo, Steve Nash and Dominique do not deserve to be on the list ahead of Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Joe Dumars and Dwight Howard."
Dwight Howard! 3X DPOY and champion. Led a team as the only true all star to the Finals. Deserved it more than Lillard
Makes total sense why Dwight Howard didnt make it
the 3 all star team with prime dwight howard surrounded by shooters wasn't stacked? dont even compare it to dirks mavs
Cuban‚Äôs freakout about the new CBA was either massive miscalculation about how the other teams would still be willing to spend/where the league was headed financially or it was just an excuse he gave the fans so he could wait until 2012 to go after Deron Williams or Dwight Howard   Either way it wasn‚Äôt good
"- Essentially average is not the same as above average; you‚Äôve changed that.  - Deadlifting strength isn‚Äôt relevant to defense; where is that movement relevant at all on defense? How many of your high school and college coaches had you work on deadlift in your strength training / conditioning? Fact is the guy gets pushed around in the post, and cannot alter trajectory of drives. He‚Äôs weak.  - Yes he‚Äôs gotten bigger. Which is why for the most part we‚Äôre looking at draft weights. Under the sssumption that everyone‚Äôs mass expands by relatively the same percentage, the discrepancy still exists. So, 180-190; there is no source lists more than that.  - What effort did you want from me? Analogous guards that also suck with the same build? I could sit here for days to list that? The onus is not on me to provide examples; that simply doesn‚Äôt make sense.  - Yes I refuted the examples you provided because they are refutable. They don‚Äôt have the same physical limitations.  - Charges are a function of how much you‚Äôre willing to get hit, which for Lowry ‚Äî great. If we think defensive positioning is a weakness, well Curry is a 6‚Äô3‚Äù guard who‚Äôs been able to average 8 rebounds a game in a playoff series and just recorded two double digit games, one against a team featuring Deandre Jordan, Anthony Davis, and Dwight Howard.  - What analysis would you like me to do? I‚Äôve said for the most part what is relevant in the body of the post. What research have you really done?  Not 100% sure where you‚Äôre coming from. I didn‚Äôt think I was taking an antagonistic tone; merely having a discussion, but seems like you‚Äôre taking something personally here."
100% on Dwight being underrated and easily a Top 75 player.  But can we pause to appreciate the absurdity of the 1 year younger Howard being a beast back in LeBron‚Äôs 1st prime 12 years ago.
"you think this stuff puts you in the top 75 players of all time?.... D Rose is the youngest MVP ever, which is probably a bigger accomplishment than what you mentioned, and hes nowhere in the list or at least worth mention as a snub. Dwight Howard truly deserves a spot way more than lillard"
"I don‚Äôt know. That made me so angry.  Dwight Howard had a better 5-year-peak than half of the players on that list. What‚Äôs funny is if he only had those 5 years on his belt (2008-2012), he would end his career as HOFer. So sad to see Dwight snubbed."
"I‚Äôm here for all of the prime Dwight Howard love I‚Äôm seeing.  Really though, while Klay is very clearly a phenomenal player, he can‚Äôt do what Dwight was doing in his prime."
"I have a problem with ""Street Clothes"" as well but not in favor of Dwight Howard? What? I wouldn't have either though honestly.  I also would take Carmelo off the list."
This list seems to be based off of hype. Dwight Howard has absolutely had a better career than AD.
Dwight Howard fell off a Cliff career wise. Went from dominant to a disappointment more than 5 years ago.
"Probably getting downvoted, though I feel like Anthony Davis is a slightly better player than both Dwight Howard and Tony Parker. Also, AD's career will probably end up being better than both, after a few more years of play. I definitely see why he was chosen over both.  I feel like AD is much closer to Dwight defensively than Dwight is to AD, offensively.  I feel like AD is a few leagues, ahead of Dwight, offensively, unfortunately.  AD's offensive game is near perfect, he's a pretty good post-player, yet he's mid-range and 3 point shooting is also fairly deadly for a big man.  With Dwight, he just never became that great of threat on offense, mainly due to not having a stronger post-game or being even just mildly better shooter.   Defensively, Dwight does have many more accolades than AD, but in reality that doesn't necessarily make one greater than others.  Pippen has quite fewer defensive accolades than a number of players, but he is still probably the primer defensive wing ever.   But back on point, I feel like Dwight was pretty dominant defensive player in the paint and pretty good 1-on-1.  I feel like against past offensive stalwarts at center, Dwight probably was much better in those situations.   Though, Davis is no slouch, either.  He's also a pretty great defensive player in the paint, as well.  Pointing more to shot-blocking or shot-deterring, in some circumstances, he's better than Dwight.  AD, I believe is more of PF, which he feels where his strengths lie, especially one defense. He's much better in a more modern NBA or against perimeter oriented teams. He feel like he can guard shooting big men or wings, a little better, especially on face-up defense.  You also don't lose much when he has to switch onto speedy wings.  He can close out on longer range shooters, with most centers, especially in the past. That's not something that was always expected of them or a heavy demand.  Because, teams simply did not shoot so many long 2s and 3 pointers. But, now it's almost a prerequisite for most younger centers, especially against guys, like Embiid or Jokic.  I feel like Jokic would be near unguardable in much older eras.   The Magic did make it to the Finals, but again that's circumstantial. There are alot of factors that you have to take into consideration with this. They were a pretty good story that year, but I doubt that team was even 2nd or 3rd toughest challenge for the Lakers that year. In fact, I don't see the Magic faring better against the Rockets, Nuggets, or Mavs.  The West is still a much stronger conference than the East.    For AD, with him being on a sub-par franchise, there's no way you can use this as a metric, by itself.  As great as he is, I don't believe too many superstars in NBA history would've done much for the Pelicans from 2013-2019.  Especially, being a very competitive conference.    The difference between Parker and AD is pretty simple, where AD is a clear franchise player.  I'm not quite sure that would be the case for Tony, especially putting him on a below-average team.  I feel like he was a great PG, but he was not that kind of player, like say CP3 or Oscar Robertson."
Nice try. Tony Parker is a Spider-Man and Dwight Howard farms beets.
"That‚Äôs the bigger issue. There‚Äôs an overwhelming majority of the original 50 who deserved their spot, but there were a few names on there who had no business being on there over someone like Dwight Howard. Hell, if they were just going to add 25 new players, Dwight should‚Äôve made it over Dame"
"He hasn't done enough individually, dwight Howard wain't on the list and he has had twice the career klay has"
Dwight Howard should be on the list instead of Damian Lillard as well.
Fuck them how does Dwight Howard not make the list
"when it comes to my spurs the way we played was a blessing and a curse for the players. you get the rings and we played great team basketball, but on the other hand individual numbers wont look that great. tony parker at his best is an easy 25+ ppg scorer on most teams. he was that efficient and one of the best finishers of all time. same thing with manu, one of the most skilled players of his time but sacrificed to be a 6th man and on other teams he also could have been 25+ ppg. that being said there are some players on the list who were in the same boat playing with bill russell back on the celtics. there are other players like dwight howard who deserved it more though, no question"
"first of all, finishing 4th or 5th in MVP voting isn't really anything noteworthy. It's good and all, but isn't something that really ""adds"" to how a player was. I'd argue that overall the league was just worse when Dwight Howard was getting those votes. Dwight had one year where he finished second in voting behind DRose. That is pretty impressive, I'd argue Dame probably has that in him just as much. Once again though, look at the guys that Dwight is beating out on the voting. Dame is losing out to a much stiffer competition, once again. Dwight is the last ranked great guy before a slew of ""very good season"" type of guys who never won an MVP sit. Yes in 09 Tim Duncan was below him..a Tim Duncan not really in his prime anymore. Otherwise Dwight is ranking above guys like..Chauncey Billups and Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony.   Meanwhile Dame finishes 4th in 2018 behind...Harden, LeBron, AD and he's beating out Westbrook, Giannis, KD. 2019 he finishes 6th ahead of guys like..KD, Embiid, Kawhi, Westbrook, behind Jokic, Harden, Giannis.   I'd argue from an objective PoV, Dame plays in a much more competitive era than Dwight did. The late 00s were infamous for being one of the least competitive eras. Dwight only makes the finals in 09 because KG is injured, otherwise the Celtics were probably the best team in the league. Otherwise what other teams were really competitive in the late 00s? LeBron and the Cavs? It takes a bit of context to sort understand that today there are more all time great players playing compared to back then."
Dwight Howard says hi
Was this sub always so high on Dwight Howard? Or did it change once he won a ring on the 2020 Lakers?
Because he is a better player than Dwight Howard and Tony Parker. Probably a top 5 player at his position all time. Real complicated stuff I know.
"Dwight took the ORLANDO MAGIC to the finals. Dwight was a force. Unstoppable.    AD on this list is pure shit. Like even if arguing ADs frame and the type of player AD is all the same arguments exits for Dwight ""Greatest Shoulders On A Human Being Ever"" Howard.     AD never got the Pels out of the first round"
"I think Dwight got passed over solely because of his personality and people look at him as goofy, not to mention he essentially got a downvote from Kobe when he was in LA and that‚Äôs always been held against him. There‚Äôs no way you leave Howard off of a list that has guys like AD, Dame Lillard, Reggie Miller, etc. on it."
"dwight howard has made 9 all-nba teams. also has 3 DPOY's...   And top 20 in 3's made should be taken with a grain of salt, half of the league never had the chance to shoot 3's."
"I think Bill Simmons summed it up well on his podcast: People simply don't like Dwight Howard for various reasons, like being a bad teammate or not maximising his skills, but for me, he should have been on there without a doubt. Anthony Davis feels like a gamble that is going to live up to his full potential even though with his injury history, that's not a given at all. This is like the risky version of putting Shaq on the 50 best player list 25 years ago."
Klay if I‚Äôm picking a guard. Dwight Howard if I‚Äôm picking anyone
Dwight Howard is a top 10 Center all time probably. Elite defender in his prime and carried his team to the Finals only to lose to Kobe and the Lakers. Very respectable.   AD is over hyped because he won in college and plays with LeBron.   Dame shouldn‚Äôt be in that list at all as of right now.
Dwight Howard? Might as well throw D rose in there too
"I mean he is still a great player, I find awards to be a dodgy yardstick at times you'll see people who don't deserve them win them so I prefer to judge the player by what I see from them. In saying that I've always loved Dwight Howard, the guy is just dominant was surprised they didn't do everything to keep him."
"I think AD will retries better than Dwight but you‚Äôre right, as of right now I‚Äôd go with Howard"
"Yeah that's subjective but imho the FMVP of Parker and him having 4 rings is more than everything Dwight ever did for the game. There are some subjective stuff that had to be included.  I will argue that also Pau Gasol deserved more, just because he stick around at high level for like 16 season with respect the 5 peak Howard played."
"Same with Russell Westbrook, I think a lot of recency bias was involved here, because the League know they had to acknowledge more active players and beloved ones in particular.  They didn't include guys like Tony Parker, Chris Webber, Paul Gasol, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh. Also Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady, even if they never played in a conference finals/finals (not considering Spurs TMac), had a chance if Lillard, AD and Russ was there...  Imho the biggest snubs are Parker and Gasol, with multiple rings and important role in winning them, multiple all NBA and allstar selection...  Edit: also Melo and Harden didn't deserve completely the call üôÑ"
"My only issue with anyone saying they deserve to be on the list is they should have to name who they are bumping off the list to make room for them.  Just saying ""this guy deserves it"" doesn't really mean anything unless you're willing to point out which guy that did make it should be removed in order for ""this guy who deserves it"" to get a spot.  It also makes for a *much* more interesting discussion to say ""Dwight Howard is better than David Debusschere"" than just ""Dwight should have made it."""
"Please, re-read the comment that started all of this and then hopefully you‚Äôll appreciate what I was trying to say rather than thinking it was so stupid  ‚ÄúDwight Howard did the classic bring his team to the championship all by himself while beating lebron to do it. That alone should get honorable mentions.‚Äù"
I‚Äôm tired of people saying Klay should have made the list when there‚Äôs so many more deserving players. #1 snub being Dwight Howard
People *really* hate Dwight Howard
"Dwight Howard, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo and Rudy Gobert."
"I think T-Mac and Vince Carter were great players but I feel like this list standards are the best 75 guys that were number 1 option on their teams or cause a huge impact on their team. Damien Lillard shouldn‚Äôt have made the list at all and I think Dwight Howard should of replaced him. Other than that, I think the list is right. I don‚Äôt have an issue with anyone else there."
Dwight Howard is probably the biggest snub
Someone start putting up dwight howard highlights on the sub
"the one thing I will give Dame which Dwight doesn't get discounted for..Dame has been playing in a guard heavy era. During Dame's career he's had to compete with Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall (when he was good), Isaiah Thomas (when he was good), Chris Paul, Kyrie, Kyle Lowry, I mean this era has been one of the most stacked guard eras in a while.   Meanwhile Dwight was making first team as a Center in an era where Shaq in PHX was 3rd team, Andrew Bogut who never made an All Star game is 3rd team, Tyson Chandler who's never made an All Star team was 3rd team. Usually the second best Center was Amare Stoudemire who's more of a Power Forward really, so yeah Dwight was making first team as literally the only TRULY dominant center during his era. Dame is out here missing First Team All NBA because he's behind Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, aka guys that are all on the top 75. Dwight Howard never had to beat a top 75 guy to make All NBA. Dame could very well get 1st team the next 3-4 years now that CP3 has cooled off, Westbrook has cooled off, Curry is still hot but maybe Dame has as good of year."
Dwight Howard being left off disqualifies the entire list imo.
Would you start a team with LBJ or Dwight Howard?
"Do you know that if you weren‚Äôt in that era? You can‚Äôt judge people on how they did things 40 years ago by todays standards. I do know in this era, since I was watching basketball  from the mid 2000s-2020s and I have a decent knowledge of the 90s, that Dame and AD don‚Äôt belong over Dwight Howard or Reggie Miller."
"Dwight Howard absolutely should‚Äôve been on there. AD hasn‚Äôt come close to being as dominant as Howard in the late 2000s-Early 2010s and I gotta be honest about Dame he hasn‚Äôt really done much. Hasn‚Äôt had too much playoff success, has 0 MVPs and only 1 first team All-NBA. Dwight has 5. On top of 3 DPOYs. It‚Äôs way too much recency bias as while Dame and AD are balling out Dwight has been a bench play for 5 seasons."
"Cause Howards prime is well removed and he pissed off too many people that will deny how great he was starting with Shaq. You cannot tell me that you can talk about 2004 to 2020 without talking about dwight.  However, Davis is not the only one I think Lilliard and him benefitted of being just in their primes now, while somehow defensive monsters like Dennis Johnson (also add a finals mvp and being part of the 1986 celtics), Howard and Mutombo (7 Def POY, 5x Blck champ, 7 Reb champ...) didn't make the cut."
"I totally see what you mean, he definitely looks way closer to a guard of the 80's than anyone in that era ever did, but I think the nba should be more clear as to whether this top 75 list is a tribute to the players most important to the league or if its actually the top 75 players. It would clear up why players like Alex English and Dwight Howard aren't included."
"I was amazed English didn't make the list, I'd add Dwight Howard to that snubs list of yours as well but other than that I completely agree"
"A guy that averaged 16 and 12 throughout his career. The rebounds are incredible but there are definitely 15 centers who had significantly more statistical output, especially offensively throughout their careers. Howard is widely believed to be the biggest locker room cancer in the history of the game. At least THREE of the teams he played for had players literally cheer following him inevitably being traded from their organizations. The guy has been traded on average, more frequently than once every two seasons over a 17 season career with 8 fucking teams. I‚Äôve never seen that many trades before in that amount of time or of a player with a max contract.   He is one of the most physically gifted players to ever join the league and was expected to massively improve aspects of his game that were lacking earlier in his career, he never really improved beyond his 24th-25th birthday, also ridiculous as most good players improve the most from 25-30. Guy hasn‚Äôt made a fucking all star team in almost a decade and he‚Äôs only 35.   The weakest aspect of his game, his FT% incredibly, got significantly worse, not better throughout his career. Has only played 75 games in a season 2 times in the past 12 years‚Ä¶ I can go in and on. 12 years ago the guy was 23 years old‚Ä¶   The stunt he pulled in Orlando, promises to the organization he‚Äôd re-sign with them if they fired their coach and then immediately opting to leave the team as a free agent following their decision to stick with Howard and fire Van Gundy. Orlando and Van Gundy had a good relationship, he ended Van Gundy‚Äòs career and caused the magic to have to pay for a coach they just fired but had contracted years remaining.  &gt;&gt;That is some of the most petty shit I‚Äôve ever seen in my life and it ridiculous.   A number of well regarded team players and all time greats publicly expressed their displeasure of this guy, including Kobe Bryant, probably the second great basketball player ever.   Dwight Howard is a nightmare and something you want to keep away from your organization at all costs. He‚Äôs also objectively a massive piece of shit. I‚Äôm so glad he did not make this ranking"
To be fair the Lakers are huge. There‚Äôs no way Dwight Howard isn‚Äôt on some indeterminate juice. They doubled and tripled teamed him and he still got 19 points.
In just the last 25 years 4 players have won 3 dpoy and not made the top 75.  it‚Äôs just not a solid argument to support Dwight Howard being robbed.
"Dwight Howard retires in 2012, he's in.  Kinda dumb they put his post-prime years as more important to his career apparently than his prime."
The surprising thing is that Ray Allen made the list over Dwight Howard.
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù but everyone I‚Äôve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don‚Äôt result in superstars is flat out wrong."
Please rise for Sir Dwight of Howard
"Russ, Davis, Harden and Dame are the ones that stand out to me that shouldn‚Äôt have made it over Dwight..   Bron, Durant, Curry, Carmelo, CP3, Giannis and Kawhi should have made it along with Howard and 3 of those other current players... that‚Äôs fucked"
You can't have watched them play. Dwight was an automatic double team in the post that year and he would just kick out they'd pass around the perimeter and hit the shot.  That team always had an open shooter because of how dominant Dwight Howard was
Orlando has been blessed with good centers. We had Shaq &gt; Horace Grant &gt; Dwight &gt; Nikola Vucevic as starters. The only gap was between Grant and Howard and it was only a year. I hope the torch is passed to WCJ/Bamba.
AD Is a better all timer than Tony Parker but not Dwight Howard.  People forget Howard was the second best player in the league behind Lebron a few years in a row
ad is just as good a defender as three-time dpoy dwight howard?
Yao Ming was also amazing the years he played. Doesn‚Äôt mean he deserves too 75 all time. Dwight Howard fizzled out and doesn‚Äôt deserve top 75.
"yeah imo dwight's peak at times looked better than ad, esp resume wise.  only argument for ad over dwight (which i kinda agree with, no shade on dwight loved that guy in those prime magic years) is talent.  as in, ad has more talent/brought more variety of skills than dwight (shooting ability, dribble moves for a big or whatever they hype ad to have, blocking machine since college, and finishing ability vs peak dwight's rim running, defense, and massive shoulders, which were all basically s tier).  i think the main diff is that ad could create for himself while dwight needed a ball handler to really maximize his talents since his post game never seemed to take off.  just imo from what i remember of dwight's career.  also, just learned that dwight has been in the league since 04 idk why it seemed shorter... man's playing in his 18th season that's kinda wild.  was gonna make an argument for peak longevity since i remembered howard being unable to reach his peak levels again after he left orlando but after looking at his stats i realized he did go to a lot of teams as the second star and wasn't the focal point by design so not entirely his fault."
"dwight has similar if not better defensive and rebounding accolades, plus he played offense. there's no world in which rodman was better than dwight howard. there's plenty of reasons to like dennis more as a guy and he's a lot easier to root for, but it's ridiculous to put him on this list over howard"
"Klay certainly belongs in over Wes Unseld, Dave Debusschere, and Willis Reed.  But so does Dwight Howard."
"In the meantime, Anthony Davis had LeBron.... and Dwight Howard /s"
"lbj/curry are two very special players but there would be more stars had people not been plagued by injuries/health. d-rose, dwight howard, lma are some names that come to mind.   and like others have mentioned KD exists."
"High - Micheal Redd 57, Tony Delk 53, Mo Williams 52, Tracy Murray 50,  Darius Miles 47, Anthony Bennett 20  PS - once Dwight Howard had 45 points while missing 20 free throws"
Take that 2011 back. Lebron wasn't even the runner up that year. D Rose and Dwight Howard were 1 and 2.
Also Josh Smith and Dwight Howard

"Yea Hakeem's fluidity and technique was just ridiculous, especially after 1993. He kept improving his technique, but after 1996 he lost a lot of his quickness and explosiveness also didn't have the same motor. Hakeem also played like a traditional center even with how versatile he was. It's like Jokic, he is a better passer and shooter than Giannis, but still plays more like a traditional center even with all his versatility. Giannis is like a combo forward. Certain attributes of an oversized wing and with his rebounding and defense, like a PF. Also in this game today, he was a monster in the pick n roll with Drew like Tyson Chandler or prime Dwight Howard."
So does that mean Sixers and   Dwight Howard next year?
"Dwight Howard used to use stickum to help him rebound, I remember one game some playerwas doing free throws and he looked at the ball all grossed out because it was all nasty from the stickum. It's banned so idk if players are still doing that tho."
Dwight Howard used to
Dwight Howard more like Dwight retire lol
Great defense by all time great defenders Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis
"No, this is Dwight Howard"
"Yeah, those things all matter...but here's the key:   AD has played 517 minutes this season.   268 of them have been with Melo and no Howard OR Jordan  160 have been with Howard OR Jordan and no Melo.   Two have been with Howard+Melo+AD. None have been AD+Melo+Jordan. There have been zero minutes with both Dwight and DeAndre on the court together.    The significant majority of AD's minutes at the 5 come with Melo at the 4.   That alone (Melo replacing Dwight or DeAndre) explains OP's numbers."
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
Then the Lakers would have never brought back Dwight Howard in 2019. It's safe to say that Dwight worked well for them that season
I'm curious how many goaltends Dwight Howard has in his career. Feel like he averaged 1 per game in his prime with the Magic.
Alright I'm so sick of you guys. Let's keep it simple.  Dwight has accomplished more in his last 5 Orlando Magic years than AD has in his career as an individual player.  That is why he is rated above AD as of right now.  AD is a much more refined offensive player but Howard is a more dominant defender.  The better career belongs to Howard and the overall better player is Anthony Davis.  Case closed.
but you aren't even making a case for yourself. What have you commented in this thread supports that you watched Dwight Howard? You rebuttal with sarcasm and mock whoever you respond to. You have made not one comment in this thread that puts anything you say in good faith. Sounds pretty in common with an internet troll.
Dwight Howard in a 10 min ad
I am more puzzled by the fact that is Dwight Howard and not any other player the one who got screwed because they picked Anthony Davis.
"What is the point of this post? Dwight Howard should be a top 75 over multiple players including AD based on things he accomplished. We are not comparing abilities here. AD is great, but he is constantly injured, thus he accomplished less. Is this that hard to understand?"
"...Harden's peak was absurd. I honestly think though that, when measuring his peak peak, his best years... the worst player I put above him is like... maybe Dwight Howard? KG? It's gonna be something like that."
Dwight Howard was only 23 when he led Orlando to the Finals in 2009. AD had already turned 25 when he faced the KD Warriors in 2018. It's not just that but AD shouldn't be missing the playoffs if he was as good or better than Dwight was.
You clearly didn't watch what was peak Dwight Howard in his Orlando days.   Dwight Howard's floor presence makes AD's look like a meekrat
Tell me you are too young to have appreciated peak Dwight Howard without telling me you were too young to have appreciated peak Dwight Howard
&gt;Peak Dwight Howard was arguably better than LeBron.  LMAO
"Peak Dwight Howard was arguably better than LeBron. He was the only player LeBron had trouble with. Come on, now."
dwight howard has one of the top three smiles of all time
"I would argue that real ‚Äúmamba mentality‚Äù is someone like Vince Young or Dwight Howard being able to put ego aside and do what‚Äôs best for your team.   Mamba mentality is mental toughness, not being selfish.  I agree that it‚Äôs his choice, but choosing to give up on years in the NBA and millions of dollars because you can‚Äôt handle coming off the bench doesn‚Äôt show mental toughness to me. It just shows he was stubborn and had a big ego."
"Dwight Howard, TMac, Worstbrook, AI, Pete Maravich."
"Eh, he went out on his own terms. He wanted people to remember him as a starter, and not just an old guy sitting on the bench like Vince Carter.   Look at how many NBA fans today just think of Dwight Howard as a 15mpg backup role player. That will never happen to AI."
You‚Äôre missing dwight Howard. 3X dpoy and got his team to the finals with his defense
Dwight Howard is over Rodman though lol prime Dwights defense got a team to the finals and he‚Äôs a 3X dpoy vs Rodman‚Äôs 2   Rodman is the greatest rebounder ever and an all time great defender but I feel like some of the people are really over exaggerating him to some mythical level lol
Dwight Howard got a team to the finals as the only star because of his defense.    Duncan anchored a defense and went to multiple finals as the star    I‚Äôm sorry but if I had to choose someone to anchor my defense I‚Äôm going with Duncan or Howard over dwight. Those two could make your bottom tier defense elite and control the glass/protect the rim.
I don‚Äôt know what to tell you if you think Rodman is in a ‚Äúdifferent category‚Äù defensively to Kevin fucxing Garnett lol. KG and Tim Duncan to me are both superior to Rodman defensively. I would even listen to a case for Dwight Howard over Rodman defensively.
"Very disrespected at times. His defense was so good it got a team to the finals. His team could get away with playing a small forward at the 4 and running all shooters just because he was that good on defense, and he was a far superior shot blocker/rebounder than green. You couldn‚Äôt play small against dwight Howard, he‚Äôd eat you alive on put backs and lobs"
"Duncan, Wallace, Howard all deserve respect. Prime dwight was a multiple time dpoy who could make a bad defensive team elite and was still capable of anchoring in the playoffs. His defense got a team to the finals.   Green is better than Rudy, but there have been all times great defenders in between Rodman and green, some is argue are better and have more to show for it."
"There's a bigger difference in a ""great defender"" and ""clearly the best defender in the league for a 5 year run."" Teams had to change their whole game plan to try to score on Dwight. Howard was better rebounder too.   The top 75 list is about rewarding careers not talent. AD needs 3-4 more years before he's close to Dwight's individual career achievements.   If AD is better he would have lead the Pelicans to more wins. Dwight lead the Magic to the finals with Hedo Turkoglu has his 2nd best player. And before you say ""East vs West"" Dwight lead the Magic to 59 wins, beat the defending champion Celtics in round 2, and beat a Younger Prime LeBron in the East finals."
so would dwight howard  anyone remember that story?
Dwight Howard
"I guess that gets to the heart of the matter. Isn‚Äôt that what being an All-Time Great is about? The accolades and the mark you made/are making in the game?  Of the new entries, and in the order of, the following compelled me to raise a brow:  Anthony Davis Damian Lilard  Ray Allen Russ Westbrook  In advance, we know why Westbrook is there. So love him or hate him, it is what it is.  Dwight Howard Klay Thompson   These two should have been on that list. Hell, AD just won a title with a healthy and rested James‚Äîbefore that, what was he? I‚Äôd just assume give McGrady his spot, if the criteria was that low."
Anthony Davis or Dwight Howard.
"Dwight Howard is a good, sometimes very good player, but  .... Would any one take Dwight over say ... Pau Gasol or Mark Gasol?"
"Anthony Davis is a DeMar DeRozan type player. He is sometimes a top 10 player on the league rn but his body is unstable and he is not reliable. You also cannot be one of the greats if you haven't done anything solo. By solo I mean taking your team to atleast a conference final, you don't have to win but atleast lose in the conference finals. He doesn't get held to a higher stand because most pundits and people know that he is only considered great because of LeBron.  In my opinion Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie, Klay, jimmy butler, and a bunch of past centres could have made it to the list."
"Again, I give the simplest counter to this arguement. Dwight Howard had a better career than AD. They were both on the Lakers team to win their only title. Let's take that year away from both of them and look at the bulk of their career. Theres no way you can argue that AD's career with the Pelicans is better than Dwight's career with the Magic. If you are going to use the championship arguement that he was the second to Lebron in the Lakers title, then Klay Thompson deserves it. Won a title as the second scorer to Curry and was a 3rd option in a dynasty. Theres a bunch of 4th options and below that won a title in 1973 with the Knicks that are in the top 75 list that shouldn't be on it."
"The NBA didn‚Äôt remove those from the top 50 list so all those comps are irrelevant. You can‚Äôt compare that era to this one anyways. Also a lot of your ‚Äústats‚Äù for Davis are overdone.  Counting top 5/top 3 in voting doesn‚Äôt matter in a career that‚Äôs pathetic. And for the championship idk if I would call him Co-MVP it was Lebron‚Äôs team and Lebron won Finals MVP. At the end of the day though, Dwight Howard, Tony Parker, Tracy Mcgrady and Pau Gasol belong in over him. Maybe even a guy like Vince Carter or Bosh who have made a much bigger impact in the league."
&gt;Dwight's narrative was still pretty golden in the late 00's and started to flip early 10's.  I'm confused...? What's your point? Russel Westbrook is still doing the same stuff he has done since his rookie season. That along with being a part of losing teams recently is the reason masses hate on him now. That's why Dwight Howard (and for some other reasons) started getting slack.   Howard still had all time athleticism and improved after that championship run. There was nothing to hate yet. Frustrated? Sure but you live with that when you are in the moment.   Russell Westbrook is playing the same way he played when he averaged his first triple double. Everyone loved the fuck out of him that season... except for a few. You telling me the hate just started randomly?
"No way. Maybe by a handful of people who would say ""see, I told you needed to add some post moves"". But you are comparing young Dwight Howard in this example to older Russel Westbrook.   Dwight's narrative was still pretty golden in the late 00's and started to flip early 10's."
"If we had late 00's Dwight Howard now, he absolutely would be getting shit on."
Dwight howard
"KG being one spot behind Larry Bird feels really off. KGs way too high in general. Bird feels low, suppose that's because his career was short, but cmon he won 3 straight MVPs. Chauncey above Dwight Howard is also a glaring misstep imo.  I get that longevity is important, but the marginal benefits between being really good and having an all-time season are huge imo. Chris Paul's VORP last 5 years including this will about equal Steph's back to back MVPs. If you could guarantee you'd get one or the other, I think every rational person would take Steph's 2 over those 5, but when you start thinking about it on a macro scale I think a list like this can get out of whack.  In general this list seems to value defensive value a lot too, which I find a bit at odds with seemingly underrating winning. Basketball, when talking about the greats, has to award playoff success I feel. Not every series, not every year, but the great players all play in multiple series that come down to late, close games where whomever out plays the other guy wins.  Also what is up with these lists and Dame? Him being over Melo doesn't fit with the rest of the list. IDK, I know it's a bit outdated, but it doesn't really fit with the way I'd evaluate players. The goal of the sport isn't to be the 9th best guy in the league for 8 years if you can be the one of the 2/3 best and actually win a title."
"6 All Star appearances and a Finals MVP alongside multiple Championships is more than either Anthony Davis or Dwight Howard can claim. If you want to talk about intangibles sure he may not be a better 1v1 player, but he‚Äôs got more accolades to his name than a handful of people on that list."
Imagine if the Warriors had drafted LaMelo and signed Dwight Howard for vet minimum.  Do we regret the Wiseman pick?
Dwight Howard Bucks
Dwight Howard finally found his cryptonite
Dwight's best offensive season is only slightly better than AD worst season (after his rookie year).  While Dwight was clearly the better defender.. it's not like AD isn't a great defender too.   You don't make 4 all-NBA defensive teams is you aren't good defensively.    Offense     AD &gt;&gt; Howard     Defense    AD &lt; Howard     And AD is still only 28.
Lol yourself. Youre caping dwight howard bro. Hoopers know dwights a bitch. Thats why hes left off all these lists. Hes had a nice little Renaissance and his prime was NICE but your career is more than jusr your highs. Debate some shit if you want but dont try lol me loke you know shit.
LeBron was outscored by both Wade and Bosh in the 2011 Finals. Would you say that he was the third option on the Heat?   Dwight Howard was the primary offensive option for that entire season. LA defending him well in the Finals doesn‚Äôt negate that.
"I feel like he‚Äôs a guy who is rated on his obvious ‚Äúpotential‚Äù vs. his actual impact. I definitely think Dwight Howard belongs in the Top 75 over AD (it‚Äôs a tough comparison though because of career length difference). Magic Howard was absolute DOMINATION - AD CAN be but doesn‚Äôt impact the overall game in the same way. Good post, OP."
Dwight Howard you sussy baka
"Agreed. By the time the retire, assuming current trajectory, I think it can be easily justified that both Lillard and Davis will be worth being on that top 75 list. However as of this moment, I‚Äôd agree that certain individuals (Dwight Howard, maybe T-Mac, Chris Webber among others) have a better case given their careers are fuller. That‚Äôs not to say that Davis or Lillard will ultimately end up higher. Reminds me of Reggie Miller who wasn‚Äôt on the original list because he had well 9 years or so and while it was really good it wasn‚Äôt quite top 50 material at the time. He needed the next 8 years to fill his resume up a little more in order to be worthy of that list( and I still don‚Äôt know if he cracks top 50 but is certainly top 75). Lillard and Davis are in the same boat to me as Miller was. Giannis is a different beast altogether and deserving, much in the way Shaq was a different beast for that top 50 list in 1996."
Dwight Howard got screwed when it comes to the 75 list. Dude is a goofball and his last few seasons have. Web kinda sad but his resume speaks for itself. lol
I dunno. Look at him. The eye test says he should be a 30-15 guy. But he isn't. Forget lebron. If fking curry can lead his team to 10-1 shouldn't AD? I think that is where the disappointment comes from. Plus he apes lebron's worst complaining flopping tendencies. He is good. But not as good as he should be. Also made of safety glass. Dude falls all the time. Soft in a Dwight Howard way. Def not the man.
"I feel like of all the factors discussed, All-NBA can be the best indicator of overall peaks and longevity. How many seasons a player was considered top-5, 10 or 15. And when you look at that, it becomes evident I think that Dwight &gt; Dame and AD.  Player | 1st Team | 2nd Team | 3rd Team | Total :------ | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | -----: Chris Paul | 4 | 5 | 1 | 10 Russell Westbrook | 2 | 5 | 2 | 9 Dwight Howard | 5 | 1 | 2 | 8 Damian Lillard | 1 | 4 | 1 | 6 Anthony Davis | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4  Dwight was the best centre in the league by this account 5 times, and in contention several more seasons. AD was 4 times. But there's nothing else. The rest of it is either injured or underwhelming."
idk if AD belongs on that list but i do know that if he does dwight howard belongs there more. the fact that he wasn‚Äôt included is ridiculous and i don‚Äôt blame him if he‚Äôs upset about it. AD couldn‚Äôt do shit w the pelicans but dwight carried a sub par magic team to the finals and his resume puts ADs to shame. he‚Äôs the only person to ever three-peat DPOY and if that‚Äôs not dominance idk what is.
Pretty much yeah . No generational centers except for dwight Howard who was compared to him.  Hence why the nba had to change to forwards for the all star game  cause all the pfs were better then the Centers now lol.
He was a bigger physical presence inside. You wouldn‚Äôt be able guard Orlando Dwight Howard with Marcus Morris and Nic Batum like the Clippers did last playoffs. Well you could try but your team would rack up fouls like crazy and give up a ton of offensive rebounds
He and Dame should not be in the top 75 over Dwight Howard.
"AD, Lillard &amp; to a lesser degree Paul Pierce should not have been on that list over Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard were major snubs.  Parker, Ginobili, Pau and maybe even Derrick Rose deserved a spot. Rose obviously had major injury issued but he and Jokic are the only MVPs not on the list. Injuries didn't keep Walton off; same should have been said about Rose.  As for OPs question: AD is and will always be a second option. Everyone knows who he is at this point and do not expect more out of him...because they're not going to get it."
Dwight Howard
"It's kind of hard to not shit on the guy who said ""I don't like Dwight Howard as a person, so I won't vote for him""."
Holy shit people are insane. People genuinely believe fucking Dwight Howard was better than AD is. INSANITY.
Yeah.... I'm a big time Dwight Howard 'hater' but the fact Davis is in over him is laughable.
I was surprised Klay Thompson wasn't on the top 75 list more so than Dwight Howard.
Dwight Howard sus
"Dwight Howard made the finals with Jameer Nelson as his best guard. Don't get me wrong, Jameer that season was actually a good player but I'd argue Holliday and Rondo are better"
"No, no they don't.  Every fan base, every thread - the key to see it is Westbrook.  He has a rough stretch, he's washes.  He starts playing like he can, they start rubbing him up.  ""Bestbrook"", ""he always does this"", ""this is Westbrook we're talking about.""  This is a website for memes, brain drain, and wasting time.  I have rarely come away from a reddit thread that (a) wasn't a very obvious consensus opinion (b) was not filled to the brim with comments repeating variations with variables of the consensus (c) trashing someone for a mistake/a cringeworthy thing they did/ or reddit, as a group, decided to shit on them.  Look at how these guys talk about Dwight Howard.  These fucking idiots were calling this dude with 8 kids gay and talking bad about him for like the last two years.  Now they're mad for him that he got slighted on that list.  Sorry, but, straight up, fuck most of you.  You guys couldn't hammer three nails if you were given a thousand tries and then you'd blame the hammer.  It's wild.  Now, all of a sudden, the Bulls have a squad again and you guys want to suck some Bull dick.    Perfect example of ""what have you for me lately"" people"
"Howard received so much hate in his prime, it's unreal. He was being compared to an almost prime LeBron, Kobe, drose, and his skill set was so old school people couldn't recognize the greatness.   Orlando Dwight was the most one of the most unstoppable forces on the court we've EVER seen."
The only thing I‚Äôm getting out of this thread is that if I say Dwight Howard should have been on the top 75 list I‚Äôll get upvoted
*when Dwight Howard wasn't but AD is.
These train comments are so fucking dumb.  Lemme guess what‚Äôs next   ‚ÄúDwight me was it Howard ‚Äú
"Are we calling Hedo a star now? Also, everybody was saying at that time that Rashard Lewis contract was a bad one until that finals run.  You had a rookie playing significant minutes there.  That team overperformed **because** of Dwight Howard.  I still think had Jameer Nelson not come back they might have had a good chance.  Not knocking Jameer, it was simply just all coming together when he was out, because Dwight was very dominant under and it allowed all the others to to stay out and rain 3s."
"Honestly it‚Äôs because he plays for the Lakers. I would say he was held to a pretty high standard in NOLA but now he‚Äôs basically just a 7‚Äô bandaid that now has a championship.   I also agree with everyone who says that he shouldn‚Äôt have been included. So for me, it‚Äôs AD out, Klay in (or Dwight Howard if you wanna do a swap of the same position)"
"I also submit to you the 98-99 Spurs. It was Robinson and Duncan down low with Avery Johnson and either Mario Elie or Jaren Jackson at guard. None of those guards made and All Star game in their careers.   The Knicks under Pat Riley had Ewing at C and one time All Star John Starks at G also come to mind. They stayed in the playoffs under Riley, making the Finals in 1994. I don‚Äôt think we can call Starks great.   The 85-86 Rockets made the Finals with Hakeem and Sampson down low and John Lucas and Lloyd Ellis at G, neither of whom ever made an All Star Team.   The 08-09 Magic went to the Finals with Dwight Howard, Hedo Turkoglu, and Rashard Lewis in the backcourt and Courtney Lee (no All Star appearances) and one time All Star Jameer Nelson in the backcourt. I don‚Äôt think we can call Jameer great."
"I know that sounds super shitty but fact  is you can use whatever logic you want to justify whatever you want for the hypothetical, time traveling super basketball team exercise. Like, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt put Dwight on because of how much he sucked in (insert Dwight Howard season from 2012-2019)‚Äù is completely valid as is ‚ÄúI put dame because he was loyal to Portland during player empowerment.‚Äù   You can‚Äôt disprove either of those arguments. You can think they‚Äôre stupid for sure but people get to use whatever logic they like."
This list was the dumbest fucking thing to happen. AD is great (when healthy) but prime Dwight Howard was a different monster entirely.
"He‚Äôs right. But it didn‚Äôt have to be AD for Dwight lol. There‚Äôs a good number of guys who have been surpassed. Bottom line, Dwight Howard is really disrespected by some people as a player and it‚Äôs not that surprising."
Nah. In a vacuum? Fully healthy? In their peak? Bubble AD wins against 09 Howard. Dwight doesn‚Äôt have the offense to win 1v1. Dwight in the post was almost a walking turnover. Dwight just had better accolades at this point compared to AD.
"Him and Lillard DO NOT deserve to be on there at all. Especially since, like you guys said, Dwight fucking Howard wasn‚Äôt on there.    Hell, Jokic deserves to be top 75 more than any other big man right now because he has an MVP."
It was Dwight Howard
It was sus when Dwight Howard
It was sus when dwight Howard wasn‚Äôt added to the list
"First of all you need to take all these reported athletic metrics from Wilt with a grain of salt, a lot of it is exaggerated or wasn‚Äôt officially measured. But overall yes, I never said there are guys as athletic as Wilt all over the place or even that there were any, but the gap is a lot smaller than when he played..for example guys like McGee.  He isn‚Äôt Giannis because he had zero ball handling skills and give me a break, he found shoot 3‚Äôs not could he shoot hook shots from there. Just because you saw a few clips of him doing that in practice doesn‚Äôt mean that was part of his game.   I agree he is probably the most gifted physical athlete in history, which is why I wasn‚Äôt saying he would be a bum or anything, I was saying he wouldn‚Äôt dominant just based on that because he lacks the necessary skill to accompany it and there are plenty of guys his size who were near as athletic.   Also fyi, he was fast and had a big vert before he started getting into weight lifting but once he started getting really strong, he wasn‚Äôt the same explosive type athlete...he traded a lot of strength for explosiveness. That‚Äôs part of my beef with the urban legends around Wilt, he has all these different alleged accomplishments ranging from him high school days through late in his NBA career...he wasn‚Äôt running crazy track times or setting high jump records at the same time he claims he was benching tons of weight, those were completely different eras in his life. Can‚Äôt act like he was all those things at the same time.  Sorry he didn‚Äôt have skill, go show me videos of him demonstrating this globetrotter level skill you claim he had. Show me he has ball handling skills, shooting skills, true post skills (foot work, actual set of diverse post moves), show me him defending on the perimeter...you‚Äôre just exaggerating everything about him just like everyone else does and thats the problem with these silly conversations...you act like he is some 2K player with 99‚Äôs across the board when in reality he would be elite in terms of rebounding and shot blocking, and would be special physically, but everything else he would be way behind the curve in, at least in terms of the modern NBA. He would be a more athletic Javale McGee or Dwight Howard."
IMO Grant Hill‚Äôs resume is at least as good as Damian Lillard‚Äôs.  But there are other guys (like Dwight Howard) who deserve to be in over both of them.
"There are many reasons, but the biggest one is their supporting cast. This team was built with 85% of its salary going to 3 people, and one of them isnt playing.  Westbrook doesn't seem to play well until mid season and AD can't create shots for others. On a team with DJ and Dwight Howard, you really need someone to create easy buckets. Westbrook is normally good at that but this season he hasnt been.  I believe Westbrook will get his shit together and AD is still elite, but you can't surround them with minimum contracts and expect much. Once LeBron comes back and settled Russ down, they will be a monster. They haven't played many games as a complete team, but I think they will be pretty nasty by February."
"hah, yeah, great detective work.  You'll have to tell us all how you figured that out.  LIke people are just allowed to READ people's usernames now?  Wild.  Your logic is brilliant too, btw.  So as far as i can tell, you think Lebron, through Klutch, insisted the Lakers try and save money on tax, instead of signing both caruso and tht, because that's Lebron's priority?  Thats your common sense theory?  We'll just ignore all the years LeGm has won championships and all that other stuff too, those were clearly all flukes.  Like can you imagine LeGM thinking he could win something with Caruso, Pope, and Rondo, and a washed up Dwight Howard?  His own fault for meddling with the FO and handicapping his team with AD's contract and no 3rd star, right?  Maybe calm down a bit.  The lakers are the most injured team in the league other than Milwaukee and they're still treading water."
"It seems like a who-whos of has-beens. DeAndre Jordan, Carmelo Anthony, West üß±, Rondo, and Dwight Howard would have been sick.... in 2010."
Dwight Howard is not..... good at free throws
maybe we can trade for dwight howard when the lakers blow it up at the deadline
No the joke was that were stating commonly-parroted NBA facts. The Josh Smith/Dwight Howard one is a perfect example of that.
"Philly's best chance to win the East was in 2019, that team was LOADED. I just need to see this 76ers team win games against elite teams before I become a believer. You all got swept out of the first round just a few months ago. You all basically just traded J-Richardson, Hortford for Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Dwight Howard. I don't know if the difference is big enough but we shall see"
"Dwight Howard (three in a row), Ben Wallace (two in a row, twice), Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo and all the repeat DPOY winners before that probably wish they got the same money. LOL  I think it's more an indication of market inflation."
Did you know Dwight Howard and Josh Smith played AAU together?
"There‚Äôs lots of giants in the league. Rudy is 2x DPOY, 4x all defense, and is currently averaging 16 points and 13 rebounds.   His career average is 11 points but he‚Äôs one of the best big man defenders we‚Äôve seen since like Mutombo and Dwight Howard...  I get Rudy slander is in style right now but it‚Äôs not like we are talking about Mosgov or something..."
Sometimes I forget we got Dwight Howard and then I see him in a Sixers uniform and I get this good feeling
"The last big I remember him praising for being a true center was Andrew Bynum, but then again, it could have been only to put down Dwight Howard."
"Dwight Howard was begging for someone to make a shot, dude was dying out there"
"On Dwight Howard back in the day,   *""He should average 28. He should probably get like three shots a quarter. He should get four points a quarter, there goes 16 points right there. Now you need to get me four offensive rebounds and put them back, there goes another eight points. And when he gets to the free-throw line 10 times, I need you to make five. That‚Äôs [29] points right there. That‚Äôs how my system works. My system was seven points a quarter. If I didn‚Äôt give people 28 and 10, I felt like a failure. I was getting doubled, fronted and backed and all that. He‚Äôs not getting any of that. So he needs to step up and really, really dominate.‚Äù*  That was 5+ years ago in an interview, but he's also said that going back as far as the Dwight Dunk Competition days."
"Our options were:  1) Trade him for pennies on the dollar  2) Let him walk and get nothing in return  3) Pay him, probably more than we should have  It's a bit overused, but Rudy makes us competitive. Favors is awesome but we would take a big step back if Rudy left.  People say Dwight Howard on a vet min could replace Rudy, but they forget that Dwight told his mom he was coming to Utah as a joke a few years back and she burst into tears. Shows how much free agents don't want to play here.  So we can't sign a big name, we can't get back the value in a trade, so we would probably need to rebuild through the draft. Which is a big gamble. We would run the risk of wasting Donovan's next few years and losing him in free agency/trade demand (we still might regardless)  We need to do what we can to stay competitive."
Gobert is a better defender than Shaq ever was. But yes Gobert is very overpaid for doing a job Dwight Howard can do exactly the same thing for a vet min
They played at a really slow pace so they were really behind in possessions per game.  They were basically tied for 2nd in 2017-18 in FTA/100 tied with the Clippers and only behind the.......Hornets.  Dwight Howard averaged 7.2 FTA/game for the Hornets that year
yea he need to learn from dwight howard
If you look it up to what everyone is failing to mention is that was  the first Olympics post 9/11 and there was a huge terrorism threat in Greece and a lot of stars didn't go. You see a lot of names missing off Team USA Dwight Howard and Kobe I think both opted out I don't remember who else because I was 14
"Shaq was the Magic‚Äôs GOAT, not Dwight Howard."
"When the NBA did its top 50 greatest players of all time list in 96, these Centers were selected: Kareem, Russell, Wilt, Dave Cowens, Ewing, Hayes, Malone, Mikan, Hakeem, Parish, Shaq, Willis Reed, Robinson, Wes Unseld, Nate Thurmond, Walton.  Thats 16 right there. Add Dwight Howard as well to that list. (5x 1st Team All-NBA.)  Kareem, Russell, Wilt are all bonafide top 10 players of all time.  Shaq, Hakeem, Malone are all players you can consider for top 10 of all time.  Realistically, he needs a really nice resume. This probably includes an MVP, several 1st team All-NBAs, and a finals appearance or two, if not a win. Something like 9 All-NBA teams, an MVP, 9 AS teams and a finals appearance to really cement himself in the discussion.  He would also benefit from AD being considered a Forward, not a Center. As long as AD is considered F/C, it makes it a little harder for Jokic."
Westbrook   Dwight Howard
That‚Äôs championship Dwight Howard to you
"Cade is an elite 1st overall prospect, think Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard  no team is trading that pick"
I think Gasol was the backup after Howard left.   They're both different types of played. Both far from their prime. Good defensively but can't play in certain lineups.   I'd have kept Howard because he was already part of the team and cost less.  Probably came down to minutes. Dwight knew he was better than McGee and maybe wanted to start. Not sure of McGee was traded after or before FA.
Are you kidding me? Dwight Howard was a beast early in his career and his a sure fire HOF.
" &gt;Marc will still be trash in March too, yay for one good outlet pass a game.  At least he'll actually be playing in May and not rehabbing his lower bodyodyodyodyodyody   &gt;You can go ahead an trash Dwight as much as you like without him the lakers lose to jokic plane and simple.  I don't think you actually believe Dwight Howard was the difference between us winning that series in 5 and losing the series.   I'm not wasting any more energy on trolls, happy new year"
"Durant, CP3, Anthony Davis, Carmelo, Brandon Roy, Embiid/Simmons (if we ignore their injury missed season(s)), Lilliard, D-Wade, Yao Ming, KAT, Steph, Dwight Howard....  None of them are 'LeBron', but no one is."

Dang. I think dwight Howard got away with a flagrant one in the playoffs. Bout the same whack to the head I believe.
NBA Champion Dwight Howard
I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúthis is a bad news source. Dwight Howard currently plays for the Magic‚Äù
the over/under for Dwight Howard technical fouls tonight is 8.5
Dwight Howard and Kelly Oubre Jr
"rookie dwight could actually jump all the way to the moon and already throw bodies around like ragdolls, he didn't need ironman delts to be strong. wiseman isn't even in the same stratosphere athletically as dwight howard."
Absolutely positive here that Dwight Howard will eventually travel back in time and lead the Persian empire to many conquests.
Have you and Dwight Howard ever spoken about who had better shoulders in their prime?
"~~To be fair, the BEST players to ever play for the Hornets are probably Dwight Howard and Alonzo Mourning, even if their peaks weren‚Äôt with us. Larry Johnson is up there with Kemba in terms of talent when he played with us. But Kemba is the GHOAT because of his longevity with the team, we were the ones who drafted and developed him, he was with us for our 7-59 season,~~  Naw as I was typing that I realized I‚Äôm not even gonna defend it, ur right it is hella sad. What a great indictment of our team for Kemba to be out greatest. Even the Timberwolves had Kevin Garnett. The Hornets are just such a depressing franchise to be a fan of.   The only other franchise in a similar situation is probably the Grizzlies, where the greatest player is either Mike Conley or Marc Gasol (idk what Grizzlies fans think, this is just what I‚Äôve seen online). Conley just got his first all-star. Gasol is a 2x All-NBA player, so even that exceeds Kemba by a lot.   At least our colors are dope though"
"If you‚Äôre going off the bubble, Murray &amp; Mitchell are the two best shooting guards of All Time.  Dwight Howard was one of the best players in the NBA for that 3-5 year period with/without that Finals run. He was the anchor of a team that was outright Top 3 in the East for a good period alongside the Celtics &amp; Cavs.  Jimmy finished 5th seed last year &amp; is en route to a Play In finish this year, I‚Äôm not saying it is, but if you‚Äôre going off it objectively without nuance, that Finals berth as of now looks like a fluke that happened in the bubble due to anything.  Jimmy has never had ‚ÄúTop 10‚Äù stats, his intangibles are what makes him one of the best players and for most of the NBA fandom &amp; media, intagibles don‚Äôt matter as much for talking points.  Also, it‚Äôs exactly like the Billups situation. These two teams got to the Finals via more of a team effort than a carry job."
"Dwight Howard. Wiseman is nowhere close to that level, obviously."
lamelo 52%? hasnt even finished his rookie year lmao and where is Dwight howard
Dwight Howard
Giannis KD Harden Westbrook Dwight Howard are 100% locks.  Kyrie Embiid Lowery pretty much in as well
"&gt; That‚Äôs rather disingenuous. Dirk had a Hall of Fame point guard   I have so much respect for Jason Kidd but by 2011 this man was so past his prime he didn‚Äôt have a single game in the playoffs where he scored 20. I think he got double digit points in 1 finals game? And double digit assists in one finals game too. Compare that to what you think of when you‚Äôre talking about all star teammates in this era (Pau Gasol with Kobe, Westbrook with KD, Wade with Lebron) and it‚Äôs not even close. That‚Äôs not disingenuous at all   &gt; and several other players who were multiple time All-Stars and All-Defensive team players throughout their careers.  Guys that were once really good in their careers isn‚Äôt the same at all as a star teammate. Is Dwight Howard and Rondo stars because they were once incredibly good?   &gt;Hakeem had a very solid team around him   This was an era where MJ was playing with Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. Who‚Äôd Hakeem have?"
"Early on in his career he was be swept by the Spurs in the Finals while performing poorly in the series(Durant balled out against the Heat in comparison), being ousted by the Celtics in the 2nd round(twice in three seasons), and upset by Dwight Howard‚Äôs Magic despite having HCA. It wasn‚Äôt until he began playing with greats such as Wade, Bosh, Ray Allen, Kyrie, Love, Davis and a plethora of seasoned vets(Battier, Haslem, Mike Miller, Birdman, Kyle Korver, J.R. Smith, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, etc)that he became the dominant post season player we now know him as.   That‚Äôs the thing about carrying biases in your arguments. It‚Äôs easy to flip your fallacies back at you."
Others mentioned Ben Wallace and Kevin Garnett. I think you can add Dwight Howard to the list. He is the only player to win three consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards.
Best I can do is 1 Dwight Howard
That's actually a damn shame. Most all defensive team appearances and no DPOY. He did overlap with Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard who combined for 7 of them. What year was his best shot?
"I watched him and remember distinctly that Dwight Howard or LeBron should have won that year. I obviously pulled up those stats from bbref since it‚Äôs not like I have a picturesque memory of every players stats from every year, but I already knew that Rose‚Äôs stats that year were mediocre  As far as things I don‚Äôt need to Google: he was the worst defender on a team that was great because of his defense. He also wasn‚Äôt surrounded by crap either, prime Noah, prime Deng, I think Boozer and Butler were also on that team. That Bulls team was good with or without Rose, he just put them over the top. The Magic and Cavs were complete garbage without Dwight and LeBron."
Dwight Howard is touching the ball in between every foul shot
Dwight Howard *has* to give the ball a rubdown before the opposing team's free throws. I've never seen him not do it.
"you know they do. that every game that is on national tv.   clippers are bad they are up 15, will this matter in playoffs.  lakers down 10 lebron was so great ad unstoppable.   nets example here  gsw curry is unquestionable, down 15.   luka is so good, down 17   did you know dwight howard and josh smith were on the same aau teams every rockets game that year"
Dwight Howard got that a lot for most of his career.üòÇüòÇ
"And then why Dwight ""10 children"" Howard never won the MVP?"
If you had told me 5 years ago that Dwight Howard would surpass RoCo as the best frosty hype man in Sixers history I would have thought you were on crack.
"Explosive from the 2000‚Äôs: Kobe Bryant, Vince carter, Allen iverson, young lebron James, young Tim Duncan.  Play out of position: check out rashard Lewis: he was a small forward that got plugged into the power forward next to Dwight Howard. He really paved the way for ‚Äústretch fours‚Äù to become more popular. He wasn‚Äôt the first or anything but he was one of the early non stars put into that role."
They have to get rid of Oubre and Wiseman and sign Dwight Howard and an couple older 3 and D players
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron‚Äôs effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie‚Äôs exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron‚Äôs people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA‚Äôs other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn‚Äôt pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
Dwight Howard was only in the game to hack the fuck out of Jokic every play and somehow Jokic was the one that had to sit due to foul trouble. Fuck playing the Lakers.
What? Literally even Jaxson Hayes or Dwight Howard can dribble the ball up the court while keeping their head up
Dwight Howard and Danny Green were the real secrets behind the Lakers‚Äô success
Bruh take it to last year   1. Dwight Howard (DPOY) 2. LeBron (GOAT) 3. AD (ALLNBA) 4. Rondo (ALLNBA) 5. Danny Green and JR (RINGZZZ) 6. Caruso (SCRAPPY) 7. Kuzma (KARDASHIAN) 8. JaVale (RINGZZZZZZZZZ)
Rodman had a stretch of 7 years were he had no less than 14.9 rebounds per game. He led the league those 7 years. No one in the league's history has led the league in rebounding for 7 straight years. Not Moses Malone. Not Wilt. Not Dwight Howard. Already that firmly places him way ahead of Robert Horry. And that's in addition to the 5 rings.
Every active player to have ever worn the number 12 for Orlando will be playing in the same game!  Dwight Howard  Tobias Harris  Gary Clark  Sindarius Thornwell
If that happens maybe they don't get Dwight Howard and he ends up going to the Bobcats and maybe they have some success and don't change back to the Hornets out of shame.
Dwight Howard.
"I also thought it was about Haslem lol, for all the reasons you guys stated.  He was also in the headlines recently for that scuffle with Dwight Howard."
"In 2015, they beat a Clippers team that choked and then got gentleman swept by the Warriors. That team still had Dwight Howard I think but he was a fringe star at that point in his career."
Dwight Howard on the other hand is an anti-vax Qanon smoothbrain
"&gt;drummond with harrel's touch and agressiveness around the rim would be a beast  This is basically a slightly-smaller Hakeem Olajuwon or Dwight Howard -- so yeah, that'd be problem for most teams to handle."
weird take. Dwight howard is weaker then jokic because he doesnt use his bulk the same way..
"Gobert is not the same as Ben freaking Wallace, as good as he is lol. This is what I mean by disrespect. And Dwight Howard LOST in the single finals he made it to a Lakers team while guarding Pau Gasol, not prime Shaq. You think this is a better defensive track record?"
"You disrespected Ben Wallace by saying Dwight Howard was a better defender than him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong that was a TEAM and everyone was important to their dominance. But it all started with Ben, the culture, the motor, the intensity and the no easy buckets mentality all came from him.   As Larry Brown said, the media likes to say that 04 Pistons team didn‚Äôt have a superstar and they‚Äôre dead wrong. I have doubts we would have even won the championship if we had prime Dwight on that team as good as he was, just because he wasn‚Äôt Ben Wallace. I‚Äôm really not sure Dwight could have held prime Shaq to what Ben held him to. Dray would tell you IQ is a huge part of defense."
Ah yes a highlight clip where curry sneaks a rebound from Dwight fucking Howard is evidence of how he can bang down against people 60 lbs heavier for a game.
"Winning DPOY was absurdly hard. You can definitely make the argument that he‚Äôs had seasons of being the best defender in the league but back then it was so stacked , as opposed to now there‚Äôs really only one or two guys if that.   Alonzo Morning, Mutumbo, Ben Wallace, KG, Ron Artest, Dwight Howard and so on."
Dwight Howard on the Wizards.
"In all seriousness, why not Dwight Howard?"
This may be a bit of a stretch but Luka will go through what harden did a bit. Ball out. Mavs will try to get pieces and if they don't work it'll be Luka's fault. Porzingis is his Dwight Howard. I wonder who his Chris Paul will be.
Dwight Howard
"you‚Äôre allowed to stand anywhere in the half circle at the top of the key i believe. definitely don‚Äôt have to be on the line. i‚Äôm not sure if he does it anymore, but in the recent past, dwight howard stood a couple of feet back to try to help his free throws"
"It‚Äôs weird to think I started watching almost 15 years ago now lol   1. Lebron or Kobe  2. Wade, Chris Paul, Carmelo (banana boat crew), Dwight Howard, Dirk  3. Underappreciated in hindsight is probably Dwight howard and overlooked is probably Chris bosh, especially after he joined the big 3. Bosh was kind of born too early as he would be the perfect big in today‚Äôs NBA.  4. Giannis, Luka, Embiid (if he can stay healthy)  5. Luka, Zion. My hottest take is probably that Anthony edwards has the potential to be in this group with his otherworldly athleticism"
"Honestly, this past FA didn't upset me as much as previous ones. I respected Giannis for staying with his team and it seemed like the Mavs didn't go too all in on him. It's FA years like 2011 and 2014 that upset me when we go all in on Dwight Howard, blowing up our championship team in the process. And then getting screwed by DeAndre Jordan and the Clippers leaving us with no real other options to sign."
An NBA point guard in today's game making 35M attempting less jump shots than Dwight Howard IS surprising lol
"Danny Green: 4 points, 29 minutes   Dwight Howard: 0 points, 8 minutes  So these are the elite role players that the Lakers so desperately needed? Lol funny how they look once they‚Äôre no longer beating up on the damn Wizards huh sixer fans? Lol"
Dwight Howard looked like chicken joe from surfs up there
2019 Dwight Howard probably does a good job defending current Jokic.
Nobody is talking about the Kobe dwight howard Steve Nash Lakers. If Dwight's back doesn't decide to die and Kobe doesn't get injured they make the finals
"Wait but sixers fans told me that Dwight Howard and Danny green are the greatest role players of all time, what happened?  Oh right now they‚Äôre playing a real team and not the damn Wizards LOL"
Dwight Howard looks ridiculous with  his hair like that. Cut it ..
Dwight howard to the bucks confirmed
"I have an irrational dislike of Dwight Howard, I can‚Äôt explain it."
"Wait, is that Dwight Howard?"
When did Dwight Howard become so terrible? He‚Äôs sleep walking even tho he‚Äôs the biggest guy on the court during bench time.
Dwight Howard literally threw the ball at Thybulle when he wasn't looking and it bounced off his back out of bounds. You're trying to tell me this is because of the Hawks?
Dwight Howard double agent with those turnovers
Hawks legend Dwight Howard on the court.
"Yeah because Dwight Howard was a highly sought-after commodity when Pelinka signed him, right ? Same with Rondo.  Then a year later every team wants them."
"The Kuzma-Schroder slander on here is laughable. Kuzma is legitimately two shortened years removed from averaging 18PPG. He‚Äôs 25 years old and was thrust into an undefined role for a championship contender. Is he going to be Jayson Tatum? Obviously not. But for a DIFFERENT team he‚Äôs still a versatile scorer that fits in today‚Äôs small ball stretch style. He‚Äôs making $13mil/YR and people are calling his contract an albatross? You can‚Äôt even get a bag of chips in today‚Äôs NBA for that much let alone a player in his physical prime that has the ability to score from many different areas on the court. For God‚Äôs sakes David Bertans is getting $15mil/AAV and he‚Äôs a statue that does nothing but pull egregious threes.  Schroder was up and down but his splits from month to month were still fairly decent. He‚Äôs clearly a strong player that probably needs a clear defined bench microwave role but insists on being a starter. Again, not a bad player for $20mil/yr which is what people are assuming he gets.  Did we all forget that the Lakers were at one point 22-6 to start the season before the injuries piled up? They were an absolute powerhouse defensively and their offense was dynamic and consistent. Clearly they were the best team in the NBA besides maybe the Utah Jazz.  The Lakers just need to run it back minus Drummond and Trez. Trez should opt out and seek a multi-year deal from a bad team with cap space and Drummond isn‚Äôt about to latch on for a veteran‚Äôs minimum at 27 years old to role play a garbage disposal.  Let those two go. Resign everyone else. Have Gasol playing no more than 8MPG. Sign Dwight Howard and/or Nerlen‚Äôs Noel."
None needed. Lakers definitely missed champion Dwight Howard in the playoffs
This Sixers team has Dwight Howard.
