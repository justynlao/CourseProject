"Terence Davis is mainly just buried on the depth chart since Raptors have too many guards. He did get the start when OG and Norm were injured, which tells me that Nurse believes in his talent.  With that being said, he needs to get his turnovers and fouls under control, if he wants to play more consistent minutes."
"Terence Davis has talent, but thrived in a small role last year where he wasn’t asked to do much. This season he’s displaying incredibly low basketball IQ, constantly driving into multiple defenders when there is a clear open man, constant turnovers, poor defense etc. TD is benching himself with his play."
"That was Terence Davis. He was also under investigation for a domestic charge although I'm not sure what ended up happening with that. I think many Raptors fans had their opinion of him soured. I know I did, I thought Masai was sure to cut him."
That was Terence Davis.
Pleasant: Chris Boucher/Stanley Johnson/Yuta Watanabe - only mentioning one would be a disservice to the rest  Unpleasant: Terence Davis
he's been called TDII elsewhere because his name is Terence Davis the Second IIRC. I don't know why there's TD3?
inb4 terence davis to the rockets
"There are several morons in NBA.  Kyrie, Michael and Kevin Porter Jr, Beasley, Terence Davis..."
Terence Davis playing this many minutes is proof Nick is in on the tank
"Nah, him and THT were talked about a lot for their defensive potential   Dort was projected to get drafted, but I’m pretty sure he turned down teams because of the lack of a guaranteed deal/roster spot similar to Terence Davis on the raptors"
Is trade Terence Davis for him. Knuckle head for knuckle head
Terence Davis gave up more points than he added in FTs alone &amp; routinely looks lost on defence.  Sure he had a nice few mins as soon as he came on but immediately undid it all giving them a lead we barely tied at HT.   Get this man off my fucking team now
terence davis has the most star potential on the team as a #1 option
Terence Davis which is who this guy is talking about on our team. He got some heinous charges including hitting his girlfriend. We’re in a bad situation with him because if we waived TD before his he was convicted the players union would absolutely come down on us.   But on the flip side it looks bad on us for keeping him because you have trolls like /u/JeffKaplanIsDaddy who accuse an organization known for growing and finding talent that is overlooked but hardworking as a team that just employs shitty people and doesn’t care about the content of their character.
keeping kendrick nunn and terence davis on their teams
Terence Davis (allegedly) also bears mentioning
"Plus Terence Davis being an idiot. They’re all professional athletes but more than that they’re just a smaller sample size of the greater US demographic. So there’s bound to be MAGAts, anti-vaxxers, etc. They’re especially out of touch though."
"I mean from an objective perspective they'd be very wise to keep Allen and give him a long term deal.  From a Worst Center Rotation in the League perspective, he's trash and you should trade him to us for Terence Davis, Stanley Johnson and a 2nd round pick."
"1. We've blown a lot of double-digit leads.  2. At the start of the season Siakam struggled a lot.  He's playing way better now, and although it hasn't translated to wins, the team (at least the starting lineup) is looking better.  3. We have big problems at centre.  Ibaka and Gasol left which has had a huge impact, Baynes and Len have been hot garbage and borderline unplayable, Chris Boucher has been very good but he isn't really a true 5.  4. We have no bench.  Norm Powell has struggled a lot (wild shooting splits of 43% on 3PAs and 31% on 2PAs), Boucher has been good off of the bench but if Baynes and Len are this bad then you might need to start Boucher.  Nick Nurse has Terence Davis and Matt Thomas (especially Matt Thomas) on super short leashes, I'm assuming because of defense, which means they're barely playing.  Malachi Flynn has only seen real minutes in three games, two of which he didn't do much and one which he played well.  TLDR: Stanley Johnson is getting consistent rotation minutes, which should tell you all you need to know about the Raptors rotation problems at the moment."
Terence Davis? Michael Porter?
"Toronto for Terence Davis, Stanley Johnson and a pair of Lowry's boxers"
"Raptors clearly need a C, and it's starting to look like having Terence Davis, Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas around is a little redundant, so... what kind of a centre can one or two of them buy?"
Terence Davis baybeee
"&gt;Our core 5 in Lowry, Boucher, VanVleet, Siakam, OG is really really good, once we go past that it gets kinda yucky. Some guys might have a good night but there’s always one guy to fuck it up like Terence Davis tonight. I’d say this is a playoff team, but a 1st round exit. I would trade Lowry at the deadline cause he’s too old for the team, and retool in the offseason with a couple 1st rounders.  Lowrys old but consistent and tbh there are time when lowry isnt on the floor and the raptors look lost."

"I guess because he called some reporters pawns, r/nba thinks he’s garbage. Funny coming from a raptors fan that watches Terence Davis, a true piece of shit."
Kelly Oubre + Terence Davis = 0
Terence Davis gets so wild sometimes
"Protected  Siakam,OG,FVV,Lowry,Thomas,Flynn,Powell and Boucher  Best player available would be Terence Davis who is a talented second year player who made all rookie but has a lot of baggage with his sexual assault case"
He deserved it over Terence Davis and Coby White imo that’s all I’m saying.
"He should get used to it. Even if he turns it around he's going to be the scapegoat.  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles are hiding the fact that OG isnt ready to create off the dribble and if you ask him to do much more than sit in a corner shooting 3s and defend its no bueno - but he's 23 so Raptor Nation gives him a pass. I'm predicting he'll get this year as a pass and then people will start criticizing him too (thats when he'll be the age that Pascal ascended)  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles also hide that Matt Thomas has an 111 defensive rating while on the floor which is absolutely disgusting defensively. Terence Davis has a 108 defensive rating. This has allowed Stanley Johnson to play (88 DRTG). Baynes has put up zero points and Len got a few rebounds.      This team has a myriad of issues, Siakam just being the most obvious."
This was hilarious to watch. Stevens put everyone back in at that point. Raptors would've made them sweat for it if Terence Davis didn't tap Pritchard on the shoulder as he shot a desperation heave
"Doesn’t seem like publicly criticizing a rookie playing his first real minutes ever is a great move. This is the dude’s third nba game ever, first time playing more than 3 minutes. Like... is it really time to publicly criticize him? Norm maybe. He’s a vet, he can at least handle it. Terence Davis is hardly even getting minutes — again, what are you getting out of publicly criticizing a dude who barely plays? Like, no mention of Siakam at all? Seems pretty whack. Dude got a max extension and hasn’t come close to that level of play and you’re gonna mention rookies and bench players when talking about who needs to be better?"
Except that Terence Davis guy and his last two plays.
"Baynes and Len have been pretty terrible so we've had zero production from the Centre position outside of Boucher. Siakam still looking like bubble Siakam although was a bit better tonight (albeit versus your backups). Nurse not playing Terence Davis cause of the domestic violence issue still being up in the air. Powell playing ass. Not being at home has to play some factor.    Kyle is still solid for a 35 year old with his playstyle. I've been happy with FVV so far. A guard who's 5'-10"" isn't going to carry a team but he's done about as best as he can so far."
Terence Davis: get blown by on defense then poster Theis lol
Terence Davis for Tatum no takesie backsie
Terence Davis signed to them and now I don’t even want him on the team
He was still good enough to make all rookie. Especially over Terence Davis.
"This is why it's a 3+ team trade.     You guys don't want to build around Siakam but Denver would LOVE having a core locked in for 3 years to try and win a chip. Siakam was a #2 option with Kawhi, Murray and Jokic would be a great fit for him as a #3.     Basically we're using Siakam to send out salary/acquire picks to give to you guys so you have a lil variety to the 3+3 unprotected's we're giving you plus young guys like Terence Davis/Malachi Flynn/Norm Powell and a whole lot of sweet salary filler with names such as McCaw and Stanimal"
Tyrese Maxey is a higher IQ Terence Davis at the current moment.
Terence Davis
"Terence Davis, he’s lost his swagger from last season, he makes boneheaded mistakes at times and his off court shenanigans don’t help."
Terence Davis
terence davis &gt;&gt; &gt;RJ Barrett
Should have stayed fam. I know Siakam disappointed lbut he was forced into the 1st option role which he was not ready for. As a 2nd option he shined in the playoffs and made big plays.  Last years roster would have been  PG: Lowry  SG: Vanvleet   SF: Kawhi  PF: Siakam  C: Gasol  6th man Powell  7th man Ibaka  8th man OG  9th man Terence Davis  Also we have all of our picks going forward and young players so if he did not think we were good enough we had assets for trades
&gt;Ask Terence Davis why he is on the outs with the raptors lol  youre joking right... Nurse has continued to give him minutes from the beg of the season when he would foul more than make shots. The way the org has dealth/not dealt with the TD situation is extremely disappointing.
"I don't think Masai would bite, he usually avoids big personalities and potential locker room problems.  Ask Terence Davis why he is on the outs with the raptors lol"
What does this mean for Terence Davis?
Can he rebound or block shots?  The *most* I'd do is Terence Davis (or Malachi Flynn) plus 1st Rd pick and filler (but I'd be more comfortable with the pick being a 2nd rounder).
"Underrated: Terence Davis, mostly because people don't like him on a personal level + his mistakes are more apparent  Overrated: Matt Thomas. Just not a good player whatsoever and our fanbase acts like we're benching some elite player for no reason"
https://ca.news.yahoo.com/video/terence-davis-block-vs-philadelphia-032900989.html  What do ya think?
I mean you're acting like it's crazy but players get fucked up by botched chase-downs. It's how Danny Green took out Klay and how Terence Davis fucked up Jeremy Lamb. Not saying they should be banned but they can very easily end up in injury.
I’d take him on the Raptors for Terence Davis and a second
This is as bad as the shit trades they're saying we'd take for Lowry. They don't want Powell and Baynes.     They want one of Terence Davis/Matt Thomas/Malachi Flynn and one of Matisse Thybulle or Tyrone Maxey. They also want a FRP or potentially two FRP's. Maybe even a second. Maybe even a swap.
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
Maxey/Thybulle/Matt Thomas or Terence Davis/FRP/SRP/ wouldn't be massive? That's like 4 prospects breh how many prospects do you need
Terence Davis was also +32 and only played 8 minutes.  He's been on fire since beating that charge
"Chris Boucher, Terence Davis with an insane +32 each"
"single game plus-minus is not a good stat, but some interesting lines tonight. Terence Davis and Chris Boucher with the +32"
It was Terence Davis. Paul Watson even had to get up lol.
Terence Davis worked out a deal with his judge to get the Raps a W for his freedom. Great way to hold up your end of the deal TD.
"Terence Davis fresh after beating his case. Turns right around, and assaults the Timberwolves"
Terence Davis holding up his end of his plea agreement with that performance in the 4th.
Insert Terence Davis court jokes here
terence davis 3 pointers dropping like his charges
play terence davis
"""While Davis has had his moments on the court this season, he is currently in the middle of a domestic violence case, as he pled not guilty after being charged with assault, harassment, and endangering the welfare of a child. Davis is accused of punching the victim, his girlfriend, multiple times.""  https://raptorsrapture.com/2021/01/22/toronto-raptors-terence-davis-situation/"
What happened to Terence Davis?
"Fuck that piece of shit Terence Davis. Anti-vaxxer, accused (now disproven) woman beater and a weird spelling of Terrence"
"Aron Baynes is 35 years old coming back from an injury and hadn't played for a year. It is what it is, but he doesnt annoy me.  Terence Davis is an idiot. Off court antics aside, he is a low IQ player. The other game, he was going at 3 defenders in the paint when he had shooters around him wide open. He had no chance."
"As a pretty big Raptors fan, Terence Davis also kind of annoys me. The off the court BS is bad enough, but on the court, he can be selfish at times and that just irks me"
"I think he has potential, maybe a Hayes for Terence Davis swap"
Terence Davis
"Terence Davis. Maybe not actually that inconsistent from game to game, but literally minute to minute he can look like a totally different player. Sometimes he’s moving off ball, getting open threes and scoring off cuts, playing good D on the other end. Other times he’s dribbling into traffic, shooting 87% heavily contested/ Late stepbacks, and basically just sticking his hand out for offensive players to flail into. Usually we get the 5 minutes of the latter for every 3 minutes of the former"
"Meh as long as we don’t lose anyone valuable, including norm i don’t mind. Terence Davis, baynes and a second rounder? Idk our cap situation completely so idk how much we can really take in rn."
Terence Davis. He is starting to get more and more minutes.
Homer pick: Terence Davis  Non Homer pick: Pj Washington
Lowry Fred Terence Davis norm and boucher
"Since we're saying quietly, Terence Davis II is nowhere near as effective as he was last year. He's still good for the occasional bucket but he makes quite a few questionable decisions on defence. Alongside his off court drama, I would hope Toronto doesn't bring him back next year. I think Jalen Harris would be a suitable replacement as 8th man/scorer off the bench next year if he develops nicely in the G-league. That or draft a replacement in 2021."
Terence Davis
"Norm is currently part of the core, and if he leaves this offseason then the core is even worse. We’d be starting Terence Davis at the 2 spot."
Terence Davis plays but I wish he didn't
"Tough to say, it’s pretty likely Lowry is leaving, so that leaves Vanvleet as the starting PG, and while we do have plenty of guards, Terence Davis, Bembry, and Malachi Flynn aren’t really starters yet. So I do see them holding onto Powell for at least another season or two."
"Oh my god, of course Terence Davis managed to fuck up that 2:1 and commit an offensive foul at the same time, Jesus Christ..."
"Would you mind one Terence ""character issues"" Davis instead?"
I'm sorry but anyone that actually watched RJ would've seen that he was still better than Terence Davis. It was said at the time and it's been proven to be even more true now. Davis averaged 16 minutes a game on a talented team compared to RJ who averaged 31 minutes with a shit coach and horrible spacing. I don't understand why Davis was even in consideration
&gt; They put fucking Terence Davis in the All-Rookie team over RJ  Cause RJ was a garbage rookie.  He's a lot better now but he was fucking awful in his first season
What a shit take. They put fucking Terence Davis in the All-Rookie team over RJ despite playing half the minutes. He got overlooked because of who he played for last year and continues to get shit on because of how hard everyone wants Knicks rookies to be busts for their own humour
"TC has been great, as has our scouting team.   I remember some fans were against trading future assets under the idea of “why are you taking picks away from TC when he’s so good at using them!” And other fans were saying “but we need to consolidate; plus, if TC is so good at drafting, he can replenish the young talent with whatever picks we retain anyway!”  I’ve even been impressed with the guys we have brought in to summer league or as UDFA/2-way guys. A short list from the past few years:  -	Torrey craig -	kenrich Williams -	pj dozier -	Terence Davis   And that’s not even including second round guys like Monte Morris and bol Bol who we ended up having as 2-way guys who spent some time in the g-league.  Really the biggest misses I can remember from this FO in the past few years are:  -	Emmanuel mudiay -	trading back from 12 to get Trey lyles and trying to snag OG anunoby at 24, only to have Masai snipe him at 23 and seemingly not having a backup plan and selecting Tyler Lydon  One of the “what if’s” we still have is if we had just selected anunoby at 12 instead of that trade. Would have a huge ripple effect through the NBA. Do the jazz still find a trade partner to go snag Mitchell? If so, does that trade affect other teams? Do the raptors still win the ship without OG (certainly not the biggest piece but a good cog in the system). Do the nuggets still end up getting MPJ the next year?"
"Yeah, that's just the nature of accusations like this. Not sure why you're expecting the masses to think logically about shit.   And [the charges for endangering the welfare of a child and criminal mischief stuck](https://www.raptorshq.com/2021/2/19/22291256/nba-news-terence-davis-domestic-assault-charges-dropped), with an agreement that the District Attorney's Office would drop them if he paid $1000 and stayed out of trouble for the next year."
Terence Davis out to piss a lot of people off this year lmao
Terence Davis wasn't missing tonight.
"Siakam, FVV, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis, Norman Powell, these are all legit NBA players that he found in the late 1st, 2nd round or undrafted. Hired Nick Nurse too. He lucked out with Kawhi but he’s a great team builder"
Terence Davis clearly
"Raptors vs. Wolves earlier this year. Ended like 87-82. Minnesota was like 1/19 from three in the first half. Toronto ended up winning off of a Terence Davis game-winner, which if you ask me, is worse than just losing the game."
"The plan is to tank the season and in the offseason we now have a lottery pick, Boucher and two good seconds we got from trading Terence Davis and Matt Thomas. We can make moves to move up in the draft or even trade those picks for a win now player depending on where our pick lands.   From there we can resign Lowry and try to actually compete next year. The Raptors were near the top of the East last year and were a quarter away from being the ones to face Miami with the same roster + Marc and Serge. People calling for a rebuild aren’t looking at the fact we already signed our core 3. A complete rebuild makes little sense and we aren’t so bad that keeping Lowry and trying again for the next two years doesn’t make any sense"
Terence Davis
"You're ignoring all the shit he's done over the last decade, we only had ibaka because of him. We only had gasol because of him. We only had FVV because of him scouting undrafted talent. We got another undrafted talent in terence davis, who ended up making all rookie team which we flipped for a pick. He took norman powell from the bucks on draft day (46th pick) for vasquez.   And not to mention the major fleece he did by trading bargnani to the knicks which not only set up the raps for the remainder of the decade but also ended up contributing to us trading for Kawhi/leading to the championship. This doesn't even include the decision making to actually choose to trade for Kawhi, since that part you said was a fluke, but even being in a position to make the trade, he set that up years in advance  Stop looking at shit so superficially and with a narrow mind, it's always deeper than what you think.   His biggest short coming was going after Giannis and making the room to do that. And some ppl were saying he could've still overpaid for Ibaka and signed Giannis but that's not on him either, ownership didn't wanna pay the penalties by going over the tax cap"
"The Raptors literally dumped a THT level player for a 2nd rounder in Terence Davis, lmao."
I will never forget some of the users on this sub who defended Terence Davis making it over RJ because of shooting percentages. Un fucking real.
"Woah, a possession that doesn't end in a Terence Davis shot attempt or Terence Davis turnover."
Terence Davis
Hawks injuries aren’t as meaningful when they’re not comparable players  Matt Thomas and Terence Davis are not saving the day for us
"It's a business. We are a playoff team, and will remain a playoff team. Kyle Lowry is on our team, and him leaving weakens us.  We will play the Sixers at some point, and we'd rather do that without Lowry against us. For this, Sixers gotta pay a premium.  Furthermore, we need a C. Without that hole being fixed there's little use in tying up money just to make Sixer fans happy.  Highly doubt we tie up a good chunk of our free cap space without even fixing the one glaring hole on the roster we have.     We aren't moving on from Norman Powell and Terence Davis for Maxey lol"
"Terence Davis thinks he's Norman Powell, but he's actually Terence Davis."
I just checked to see who was born closest to where I live now and it's Terence Davis. Probably born at the hospital where my sister in law worked.

THANK YOU KINGS but fuck Terence Davis
"I watched the entire fucking game. I watched our starting back court brick 3 after 3. I watched Dennis drive into the lane multiple times while turning the ball over. I watched AD get beat off the dribble Richaun Holmes and Terence Davis. I watched LeBron turn the ball over time and time again and take horrible fucking 3 pointers.   Drummond isn't forcing Dennis/KCP to miss wide open looks. He's not forcing Dennis to slip and fall every time he drives into the lane. He's not forcing AD to fail to move guys way smaller than him or turn the ball over the second he gets doubled. He's not forcing LeBron to take dogshit heat checks. Hell the only 3 LeBron made was off a good Drummond screen.   I've said it a billion times now but while Drummond didn't play particularly well by any means, this loss is on LeBron/AD/Dennis/KCP. Not him."
Terence Davis is a Laker killer
"Terence Davis lit the Lakers and the Mavs up. I haven’t watched him much, why did Toronto let him go?"
"Halliburton was fuego all night but Terence Davis caught fire in the fourth quarter. A steal into a slam, free throws, and a clutch three all while guarding Lebron and eventually contesting him out of the would be game winner"
Terence Davis fucking balling rn
"Had Toronto known they were going to be able to keep FVV, but lost Serge and Marc, I think that we would’ve gone for a big in the draft instead of 2 guards (this was also when Terence Davis and Matt Thomas still looked promising and we had Norm still)"
I didn't watch this game but I can only assume the Matt Thomas/Terence Davis matchup was legendary.
"Thank you Kings! Very cool!  Keep winning pls the 7th pick is the Raptors ceiling  However I hope Terence Davis gets DNP’ed the rest of the year, fuck that guy so much"
Give me Terence Davis tho. He was a STEAL for the Kings and only cost them a 2nd rnd pick
"Lmao. You're just misinformed if that's how you think the league handles these things. How about you list an example of a player being fined for one of these 'irresponsible statements' before you start saying shit? And no, Meyers Leonard's racial slur doesn't count as an 'irresponsible statement' cause that's called being a jackass. I can at least recall players expressing their beliefs in conspiracy theories (Kyrie, MPJ, Dwight) and not getting fined. Not even Terence Davis who showed up at the bubble with a hole in his mask and violated rules got fined."
"Claxton,Dean wade,Terence Davis,Isiah Roby,Terence Mann, and Eric Paschall"
This the guy who was all up on Terence Davis last year I bet.
They got terence Davis for a 2nd round pick right?
You mean all rookie 2nd team Terence Davis?
"Terence Davis Jr  He looked like he'd regressed from his rookie year with us, hopefully the change of scenery will help him get back on track."
We still needed a bench guard. We also traded for a wing in Terence Davis
"THT is mot a better player than MPJ, Tyler Herro, Cam Johnson, RJ Barrett, De’andre Hunter, Brandon Clark, Kendrick Nunn, Terence Davis, PJ Washington, or Thybulle. And that’s just from the top of my head.    He’s a good player, but thinking that he’s top 3 in that draft class is absurd homerism."
or terence davis
I’m a Kings fan and I am literally begging to sign Terence Davis and Harry Giles. It’s by far us.
Is this Terence Davis’ account?
"Anti mask and girlfriend abuse.  https://www.tmz.com/2020/10/28/terence-davis-toronto-raptors-arrest-girlfriend-alleged-punch-nba-rookie/  Brutal stuff. I was surprised when we got a 2nd for him. I was happy to see him go even though, he was 2nd team all rookie last year"
Who the hell is paying 5M+ for Terence Davis....?
"There are some intelligent players, and then there is Terence Davis."
Terence Davis
Terence Davis? Rudy Gay? idk
I know he has his off court drama but Terence Davis deserves to be here on this list (unless you don’t count undrafted)

Are you thinking of Terence Davis? Mann has only been in LA.
I probably would pretend like Terence Davis didn’t steal that spot a year ago but…
Ben at the 4. Plenty of space with fox hali and Barnes. Plus Terence Davis can shoot too
Im gonna guess he means Terence davis
Terence Davis.
Waiting to see where Terence Davis signs in the offseason
"I worked at a restaurant throughout college &amp; met DK Metcalf, AJ Brown, Eli Manning, Morgan Freeman, and Terence Davis. Davis was the only one that didn’t tip well"
"this year is the best Fox has been, Barnes was better this year, Bagley is always hurt, Haliburton was a top 3 rookie, Holmes is better than Willie, Terence Davis, Harkless, and Wright all played very well after the deadline and should've resulted in more wins. Walton also doesn't use Buddy the way he should be which has made him worse, they also had the worst defensive rating in the league. if you actually think Walton is even a decent coach then you're insane, he's always sucked and only has this job cause Vlade wanted to hire his friend without doing an actual coaching search."
Delon wright and Terence Davis we're available for nothing at the deadline too
Top 5 Ant-Vaxxers  LeBron  MPJ  Terence Davis  Dennis Schroder  Dwight Howard
"Terence Davis tricked us all. We thought he was good, but he actually sucks. Also he's a dumbass.  delet this"
I can agree Terence Davis has potential but calling it one of the worst trades in recent years is a stretch as he is not the kind to turn a lottery team to a potential playoff team
"Short answer: no  Long answer:  - Toronto is a team with potential but they had a down year considering being in Tampa, injuries and COVID, leading to eventual tanking.  - Any bum can put up stats on the Kings if given minutes (see Whiteside and Bagley)  - At the end of the day, it's just Terence Davis..."
Terence Davis 2 teammates away from Magic Johnson.
Big brain move trade Terence Davis to you guys. He won you some games
"Playoff experience for us especially doesn’t mean much. Nurse was never going to play the young guys in any meaningful game, he never did. Last year in the postseason, Chris Boucher and Terence Davis were basically stapled to the bench. Chris may have earned an opportunity this go around, but other than Trent, our young guys wouldn’t get that experience this go around. The other pieces of the core have already been in a bunch of playoff series"
Terence Davis made the all rookie team and was pretty good in Sacramento this year   He’s a first rounder

"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
Terence Davis will make sure that doesn't happen
I have nightmares of Terence Davis tbh...
"Hopefully Utah can contain the likes of Louis King, Damian Jones, and Terence Davis"
"We actually made out with 2 second round picks from that draft, not from trading Dewan but from trading our undrafteds Terence Davis (fuck that guy) and Matt Thomas"
Terence 'Almost Luka Doncic' Davis
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
That fanbase hyped terence davis as the next all star during his rookie season and they shipped him for a bag of peanuts.
It’s easily RJ Barrett. Left off the All Rookie team for Terence Davis. Left out of the top 125 in The Athletic. A lot of people I know still prefer Tyler Herro over him. He was our 2nd best player all year yet he’s sorta seen as a role player. I feel only Raptor fans appreciate the guy
"I see Hart as playing a lot of 3 for you, plus I'm still not convinced Buddy Hield is going to be on this team for game 1.  Also Terence Davis is not better. Also a rookie is probably not better right away."
"Terence Davis, Malik Beasley, Jaxson Hayes, Ron Artest, Jason Kidd. Lol and that's not even NFL yet"
"Not a big name by any means, but I’m gonna go with Terence Davis and the Raptors fan base.   Here’s a brief summary of his Raptors tenure:  Debut -&gt; Fan Favourite -&gt; Season suspended (Corona) -&gt; Disney Bubble -&gt; Anti-vax Instagram posts -&gt; Deliberately poking a hole through a face mask whilst walking around for the media to see -&gt; Limited play time in bubble -&gt; Accused of domestic abuse/violence during off-season -&gt; Hired Jeffery Epstein’s lawyer -&gt; 2020-21 season resumes -&gt; plays poorly to start the season and never really picks himself back up -&gt; Traded to Sacramento for a 2nd rounder  Went from a fan favourite to a total pariah in less than a year"
"This one is a small one, but Terence Davis was a very solid piece for us in his rookie year (undrafted). He was quickly becoming a fan favorite early in the 2019-20 season. However, fans turned on him when he pulled some anti-mask stunts and he, you know, beat the mother of his child."
Terence Davis
Terence Davis in shambles
"3 or 1   Would replace Marques Johnson with Iso Joe and take 5 tho.    Some others to add   Curry family   Tim Hardaway, THJ, Anfernee Hardaway  George Hill, Grant Hill, Solomon Hill   Anthony Davis, Baron Davis, Terence Davis   Ben Gordon, Aaron Gordon, Eric Gordon"
"For Hield, Bagley, Terence Davis"
"Fuck Terence Davis.  Does Sacramento have a mask mandate? If so, he might blow his whole salary on fines"
We also aren’t playing Terence Davis or Alex Len  Bench is going to be in a way better spot

Don’t forget Terence Davis
Is there room to sign Terence Davis?
"Terence Davis, too, IIRC"
"So since the 2016 draft there are a few candidates  * Raptors got: Siakam,Vanvleet,OG,Terence Davis,Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes * Heat got: Bam,Herro,Robinson,Precious and Nunn * Sixers: Simmons,Fultz,Thybulle and Maxey  But I think its the celtics: Brown,Tatum,Williams,Grant,Langford and Pritchard"
"Lmao Raptors aren't taking Schroeder off your hands. We have Fvv, GTJ, and Flynn. Meanwhile we have no starting caliber center. We traded Terence Davis for scraps because of his ego so were not taking on a diva like Schroeder on an overpaid contract. Foh lakers fans think that were going to overpay for their mistakes"
"We're just talking shooting and nothing else? There's a busload of guys available on the market who are good shooters who probably wouldn't be super expensive.  Carmelo, Ellington, Lou Will, Ennis, Jeff Green, maybe Redick would be willing to make a near-min deal, maybe Korver, E'Twaun Moore, Patty Mills, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Kent Bazemore, Korkmaz, Otto Porter, Temple, Terence Davis, and on and on.  Obviously these are all role players and certainly not the elite of the elite, but they're all guys who can give shooting/spacing on cheap deals."
Mood. fuck Terence Davis.
"[""We're told Terence DID NOT plead guilty to any charges ... but the two sides were able to agree on a deal. In short, the D.A.'s Office agrees to drop the remaining 2 charges if Davis pays $1,000 in restitution and stays out of trouble for the next year.""](https://www.tmz.com/2021/02/19/toronto-raptors-g-terence-davis-domestic-violence-charge-dropped/)"
Let me be the first in this thread to say fuck Terence Davis.
"Jesus Christ the irony coming from a raptors fan lol. You guys will hype up any young player to death, wasnt terence davis the next face of the league at one point?  Nobody has ever fucking claimed tate is a superstar or anything. KPJ clearly has shown flashes of offensive brilliance and to imply he doesn’t have star potential is pure hating"
"The Raptors also drafted Ed Davis, Terence ross, and valanciunas with lotto picks in your timeframe so that’s not accurate either.    Maybe, just maybe, if your data shows that your flaired favorite team is so good at drafting that they’re twice as good as the second best team, and the team that won 3 titles with mostly self drafted players picked no higher than 7th is one of the worst.. you should take a look at your ranking system again?"
We all thought Terence Davis was on track to be the next VanVleet. Then the bubble happened.
"If the TD they were expecting was Terence Davis, then expectations were met. Fuck that guy BTW"
Terence Davis III off the bench (former Raptor who cut a hole in his mask in the bubble)
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Ben Simmons, Richaun Holmes.   Terence Davis, Louis King, Mo Harkless, Chimezie Metu, Tristan Thompson."
Lol well they took Terence Davis so 💀 seems like they like sloppy seconds over there I suppose
"In the full article they have him at 24, behind Terence Davis, Naz Reid, and Chuma Okeke"
"Nick Nurse is pretty brutally honest to the media when he isn't happy with a player's play.  Terence Davis, Stanley Johnson, Siakam, FVV, Powell are all players who responded positively with good performances following public criticisms from Nurse.  The difference I see between Nurse and Doc in their situations is you can understand the underlying tough love messaging in what Nurse says about his players.  For Doc to stutter ""... I don't know."" when asked if Ben can be the star of a contender was a damning insight to how he truly feels about Ben.   He must have reached the point where he realized Ben just didn't have the mentality and work ethic to get Philly to where it needs to be."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.nba.com/amp/news/toronto-raptors-head-coach-nick-nurse-on-terence-davis-i-believe-in-the-kid/vg0c2d4t095m1dzjtprx4wmka  ""After seeing him go scoreless against the Blazers, Nurse said that Davis is ""just not playing well."" He added that the eight minutes he played — the first time Davis had played single-digit minutes since the first week of November — was ""probably five minutes too many."""
Ah the Terence Davis
I'm going to assume that both Buddy and Bagley are still on the roster.  Fox/Buddy/Harkless/Barnes/Holmes  Haliburton/Mitchell/Metu/TT/Terence Davis
Terence Davis walked around with a hole in his mask during the bubble.  Also posted IG stories of fake doctor articles before Raptors PR presumably told him to take it down.
Terence Davis about to retire.
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
Terence Davis? I'd throw him into this deal
Terence Davis as well probably
"And yet in the playoffs Milwaukee was the number one defensive team with a DRTG of 107.6 and the 11th best offensive team with an ORTG of 112.9. So yes, that's the biggest driving force for why the Bucks won, the Giannis being one of if not the best help defender which they crafted their entire defensive scheme around and supplemented with players to minimize Giannis' weaknesses namely guarding guards and smaller wings on the perimeter. Wow, it's almost like teams turn up on defense when they are in a seven-game series cause they can gameplan more, especially ones with transcendent defensive players like Giannis.  The Jazz fell off defensively, but like I pointed out before not because Gobert is a bad defender or not all he is cracked up to be but because the Jazz built their team on just funnelling drives to the middle into Gobert cause he is the best defensive big in the game right now and have a ton of guards and wings who are just bad at preventing straight-line drives or at bare minimum being enough of a deterrent so that Gobert can more easily come in to help on top of having the ballhandlers man coming up on their hip. But, as people who have some actual understanding of NBA defense especially in the playoffs have been saying for seasons now, the Jazz have overly relied on Gobert to be the end all be all of their defensive system which makes it easy to gameplan against as shown year in year out in the playoffs. Is this because of Gobert? No, because Nick Nurse and the Raptors coaching staff crafted a defensive system to hide the weakness and bouy the strengths of an even slower footed defensive-minded centre in Marc Gasol by having our guards being aggressive on screens so as to stay on the ballhandlers which allows Gasol to help and then recover, on top of drilling rotating to the open man for all our guards and wings, on top of the coaching staff minimizing minutes for players who are weaknesses on defense whether it be due to physically not being able to (Matt Thomas for example) or not being able to keep up mentally with the scheme (Terence Davis in his second season and Malachi Flynn for example), on top of the front office looking to bring in players who can actually play defense as well. If the Jazz were to not have a roster of wings and guards who are just not good defensively and just hope &amp; pray that Gobert goes Super Saiyan-jin, the Jazz's failings are on the coaching staff and front office. Cause in the regular season where their scheme works cause teams are not gameplanning every single night but rather have generalized schemes on both ends, their ""Gobert, Sink Or Swim"" defense works and has year in year out."
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
Terence Davis it seems.
"The real Big 3 of Terence Davis, De’Aaron Fox, and Richaun Holmes"
"Not to overreact to them going 3-0 in the preseason, but damn the team looks completely different than the poverty Kings of years past. The defense looks way better than anyone could've guessed, all the pieces are fitting well, they even have great depth. I'll break down the players in my opinion  FOX: 2nd best point guard in the league, could be 1st best this year, should have an MVP level season after coming back from injuries  Bagley: Unpopular opinion, but he's going to propel himself to the heights of players like Booker, Mitchell and Lavine  Haliburton: In my opinion the best rookie last year, I could see him averaging 20ppg this season easily. He also looks much better defensively  Hield: One of the best shooters in the league, need I say more  Ramsey: One of the best rookie defenders last year, has the potential to make an all defensive team this year, becoming the youngest ever to do so  Davion Mitchell: Arguably the 2nd best guard defender outside Holiday  Barnes: Great 3&amp;D player  Holmes: Elite defender and rebounder  Terence Davis: Naz Reid  In conclusion, I would be shocked if the Kings were lower than 5th seed in the West. The only rosters imo that are 100% better are the Lakers, Suns and Jazz. Discuss"
Terence Davis took care of that :/.   ... too soon?
"Nah, it was just widely believed that he was the member of the team that only had one dose. The Raptors haven't had an openly anti-vax player since Terence Davis."
Neither is Terence Davis
"Hi I’ve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I’m not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that’s assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs— and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I’m expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he’s at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it’s been in like 10 years. Yeah, it’s not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we’ll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we’re gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go “wow we had no idea they were gonna be so good” I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"
Fave: OG Anunoby  Least fave: probably Terence Davis
thats terence davis
"And I’m super happy about it, mostly because I disagree heavily with your criticisms of those players.  In terms of the surrounding cast, you’re always going to have role players on smaller deals surrounding your max players on any contending team. Denver happens to be very good at finding and developing talent through the draft/udfas/2-way contracts etc. Monte Morris, PJ dozier, Torrey Craig, Terence Davis, Kendrich Williams we’re all 2 way guys our FO found just in the past few years."
Idk what Terence Davis’ status is but I bet he’d be available for a solid 8 points off the bench
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/08/03/raptors-rookie-terence-davis-arrives-to-game-with-hole-in-mask/  Dude went undrafted so your point kinda stands still however still funny nonetheless
"Former player, but the anti vax bullshit and allegations of beating his gf really destroyed my high view of Terence Davis.  I literally felt like Obi Won Kenobi finding out one of my favorite Raptors was a sack of shit irl."
"It's not AD's fault, he was posting up known defensive juggernauts Terence Davis, Tristan Thompson, and Buddy Hield. Occasionally even Lebron's own Kryptonite, Marvin Bagley."
"Terence Davis probably had more time guarding Lebron than any other player on the team lol, Gentry only finally put Bagley out there when TD fucking fouled out. To his credit, Davis played some fucking bulldog defense out there even against AD a couple of times but he's just way too small to really affect either of those guys' games lol."
I dunno. I think it was really unrealistic how they kept having LeBron miss his shots while being guarded by Terence Davis and then was outworked in tbe lost by Marvin Bagley. That just seemed really forced.
"LBJ 2-13 from deep, AD 0-5. That's really the game right there. They had such a huge size advantage in the post with the Kings having nobody that could really guard AD and Lebron mostly being covered by *Terence Davis* in isolation, but they settled sooo much. And it wasn't entirely the 3 pointers even, there were so many times they settled for tough contested fadeaways too.  So glad the Kings pulled that out especially after going down 13 in the 4th, and also failing to even get a shot off at the end of 2OT with a full 24s on the clock. Fox was a fucking assassin and Buddy was a sniper in clutch time."
"We were missing literally our entire starting front court for almost all of this game. We ran a Marvin Bagley/Alex Len combo for most of crunch time. We had Chimezie Metu and Terence Davis guarding LeBron at times. This is the gutsiest win I can remember, but the Lakers should be ashamed"
"Our front court is Terence Davis, Bagley, and fucking Metu, and the play call is a pull-up LeBron 3 lmao"
"Here's something I wrote for a different Kings post (after the Luke Walton firing).  ---------  As far as roster goes, I think everyone's movable at the right price. However, the biggest issue is the lack of decent players at every non-PG position. Peep their depth chart.  PG: Fox | Davion Mitchell | Jah'mius Ramsey  SG: Haliburton (also PG) | Terence Davis | Robert Woodard II  SF: Barnes | Hield | Mo Harkless  PF: Metu | Bagley  C: Holmes | Len | TT | Damian Jones  Let's get the first issue out of the way. Their roster stinks. They have maybe 5 rotation-level players (Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes/Hield). But then what?  Davion Mitchell is an all-D, no-O rookie for now. Terence Davis has some scoring ability, but is rightfully stuck behind three decent guards and D Mitchell.  Mo Harkless has been a body at his recent stops. They've started Mo Harkless in 11 games. They started Chimezie Metu recently. Not saying either is bad bad, but would either even be getting playing time on most teams?  Alex Len has been hanging on in the league by a thread for a few years now and wouldn't be able to play onto most contenders' rosters. TT is washed (partially because of the direction the NBA took) and is a walking trade chip at this point.  Ramsey and Woodard would be two-ways at best on most teams. I don't think Damian Jones has ever been good, even when he was on the Warriors. And Bagley hardly plays.  You look at other mediocre rosters and they all either are clearly developmental (Rockets, Thunder) or they have at least 8-10 NBA level players on the roster, if not more.  The Warriors, Phoenix, Utah, Wizards, Nets, Bulls, Heat, Cavs, Bucks, 76ers, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, and Knicks all have a decent list of players who they can play who aren't complete liabilities (that's half the league, at least). Even for the 4-11 Spurs, you can point to 8 guys who should be on a contender's 10 man rotation (depending on positional excess). The Kings pretty much only have five rotation-quality players, and no amount of coaching will salvage that.  -----------  Their roster is talent-dry AND they don't enough have any assets worth a damn. They have +2 second rounders in total. That's it."
"I mean, they traded for and re-signed Terence Davis so treatment of women by their personnel doesn’t seem to be a concern in that organization"
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"

Terence Davis owns a bank?
Terence Davis
"Are you getting hate responses in DM or something? Lol nobody even responded aggressively or anything  To answer though yeah we have more talent this year than we have in a while, probably since we have cousins/gay/rondo  Fox (bad season so far), flamethrowa Buddy hield, advanced stat darling Richaun Holmes, smooth and steady Harrison Barnes, future inside the nba member Tyrese Haliburton, thicc boi Davion Mitchell, and seen flashes of talent from bench pieces like Terence Davis or Len  Nothing that’s gonna blow you away or anything but a couple potential All-stars on there, and some depth. Not on the Hawks level yeah but definitely better than the pelicans or the thunder"
Terence Davis made an All-Rookie team over him lmfao
"Davion Mitchell got drafted by us when we already have 4 solid guards, Fox, Tyrese, Buddy, Terence Davis  Which sounds bad, although at the time I know we were looking at trading Buddy so then he would’ve just been under Fox and Hali  The minutes split is still a little problematic, there’s only 96 minutes to be had at the 1 &amp; 2 spot and now we gotta split it between 4 dudes (TD is out of the rotation atm). But Buddy plays at the 3 sometimes, we’ve even put in 4 guard lineups at certain points.  Aside from the guard logjam, Davion has been awesome for us. It’s actually not a bad situation at all. He gets to step in right away and play big minutes, even closing games for us. We were terrible on defense last season, and definitely a little soft last year- both things that Davion excels at. The guy is a great defender but the hard work and grit he gives us has gone a long way.  If you just look at box score numbers, he’s not gonna jump out at you. His shooting hasn’t been great. But he has great vision, plays under control, and that DEFENSE especially on ball is awesome. Dort/Smart/Holiday/Thybulle/rookie DAVION all come to mind this year when you think of defensive stoppers (shouts out to GTJ too)  People talk about a culture shift all the time with our team, this is the first year it actually seems real, and Off Night’s a big part of that. It probably wasn’t his ideal situation to come into (Davion on the warriors would’ve been amazing) but he’s the type of guy who’s gonna make the best out of any situation, and he’s doing it with us. Love this guy man"
Fucking terence Davis over him LMAO
"You would think, but the Raps fans vehemently defending Terence Davis during the all rookie team selections two years ago had a lot to say about RJ"
"Oh yes, arguably the worst shooting team in the NBA should trade one of our better shooters for someone who has essentially no offensive game at all, requires shooting on the floor to be effective due to having no game unless right at the rim which we don't have right now, has been shown to not take any criticism from his coach or teammate which would not work with Nick Nurse who regularly speaks truthfully about our players to the media (such as Boucher and Flynn this season to Terence Davis last year through to Gasol in 2019) and has already refused to work with his team's shooting coaches choosing his brother instead which won't par with the Raptors. And his contract is huge.  Simmons is not that guy. He isn't worth the assets, trouble and salary just to see if we could go full long boi lineup when we have already put out long boi lineups for runs and that's without long boi Siakam."
2015: Delon Wright with pick 20  2015: Norm Powell with pick 46  2016: Jakob Poetl with pick 9  2016: Siakam with pick 27  2016: FVV undrafted  2017: OG Anunoby with pick 23  2019: Terence Davis undrafted  2020: Malachi Flynn with pick 29  2021: Scottie Barnes with pick 4  2021: Dalano Banton with pick 46
