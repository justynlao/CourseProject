Dennis smith jr revenge tour?
"To be fair there are ""empty stats"" but people just give that label to any player putting up good numbers on a bad team. It should just be reserved for players with low efficiency, high volume stats like Dennis Smith jr who averaged 15/4/5 on a woeful 47%TS or Andre Drummond who is averaging 18/15/3 on 50%TS which for a guy who should just be catching lobs/dunking is awful. Those are truly empty stats because neither player is actually making a meaningful contribution to winning."
Dennis Smith Jr still has PLENTY of game left.  There are more than a few teams that could use him.
"How did they win the trade? Even if they let him go for nothing, that‚Äôs better than the trade they did. Dennis Smith Jr did nothing. I‚Äôm not gonna even argue if the Mavs won the trade, but the Knicks did NOT win this trade. Seeing some horrible takes on here for karma"
"This is the Dennis Smith Jr BS all over again. He‚Äôs flashy for 1 out of every 10 games, and people hype.  There‚Äôs 10 players in the NBA with more points on less FGA, meanwhile there‚Äôs 0 players with less points on more FGA.  Long story short, he still isn‚Äôt a good scorer. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted because this thread probably attracts Knicks fans only, but he‚Äôs still not playing well. Maybe in the future, but definitely not now."
Dennis Smith Jr
"IQ is definitely a good bet and a great player I think it‚Äôll be harder for him to actually win it because of the hype around melo, I actually pull for y‚Äôall a bit I know Dennis Smith jr. Wasn‚Äôt trying to slight IQ"
"Grasping at straws now. Regardless of KP vs Randle, enjoy Dennis Smith Jr, I'm sure he'll get a LOT of great experience in that G-League bubble. We'll enjoy our generational superstar and KP, who will undoubtedly get better this season. I look forward to seeing your username in the threads!"
"Wow you're right, they get Dennis Smith JR (Who is officially now in the G-League) and we got all of their players who allowed us to go to the playoffs and have a great series against the Clippers!"
"I just looked up their draft history. I knew they hadn't hit in awhile but I guess I didn't fully grasp how bad they've been. Four straight years of picks 3-9 and almost nothing to show for it. Then if you consider them trading Porzingis for Dennis Smith Jr, it's really 5 consecutive lost picks between 3-9. Insane (though there is still a chance RJ is a star)."
"Dennis Smith Jr, a Knicks Guard has asked to play for the G-League team due to lack of playing time/develop his skills.  The Knicks have agreed to the request"
Dennis Smith Jr is a myth
What happened to Dennis Smith Jr and Payton?
"Luka was our leader in minutes played his rookie season. Jalen Brunson played 20-30 MPG his rookie year and averaged nearly 10PPG. Dennis Smith Jr. also played nearly 30 MPG his rookie season, even though he was very raw.  Rick has just never really had great rookies, outside of recently, and typically is not one to give unearned minutes."
"After Dennis Smith Jr.‚Äôs rookie year I thought he would at least develop into a top starting level point guard; I really loved his game and his attack on the court. Now it looks like he might not even be a serviceable back up, which is crazy with how young and athletic he is at his position"
Even if Dennis Smith Jr were still in Dallas Jalen Brunson would be playing his minutes.
Dennis Smith jr. but now he's fallen into the bust category sadly.
If Dennis Smith Jr can get one so does KD
"We would have taken Wendell Carter JR, which would've given us a superstar lineup of Dennis Smith Jr, Wesley Matthews, Dorian Finney Smith, Harrison Barnes, and WCJ. I'm sure we would've gotten at least 8 wins that year :)"
"I don‚Äôt blame him, I mean Burke, a throw in salary match is legitametly better than Dennis Smith Jr.  üòÇ"
Dennis Smith Jr it is
J.Cole name dropped fultz and Dennis Smith jr in the same song
Dennis Smith Jr   Marvin Bagley    Stanley Johnson
"No, he‚Äôs quite literally bad. I think even dennis smith JR would make a defense pay when they refuse to guard him."
Dennis ‚ÄúJR Smith‚Äù Schroder
"Dennis ""JR Smith"" Schroder"
Dennis ‚ÄúJR Smith‚Äù Schroeder
how does one lightly used Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2023 2nd round pick sound?
Dennis Smith Jr. Was super high on him coming out of college. Figured he would be a sure thing.
Dennis smith jr. again...
"Whatever helps you sleep at night  Even if what you're saying was true (it's not), Dallas won the trade anyways considering Hardaway Jr and Burke's value  Have fun with Dennis Smith Jr. and perpetual mediocrity!"
"lmao, THJ and Burke alone won Dallas that trade. We traded a scrub in Dennis Smith Jr. and two late first round draft picks for THJ who is a 16-18 PPG player on 40+% from 3, and Trey Burke who has been incredible for us.   Not to mention we got Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is who is a 20/10 guy."
"This was year one when DeAndre Jordan was hitting Luka on the head to take uncontested rebounds &amp; Dennis Smith Jr was moping because Luka is a little better than him at basketball so we had to make moves.   I like our team now, we‚Äôve made good moves. We have 6 key rotation players out today, let‚Äôs judge the team on a larger body of work"
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
"It's a valid point but personally I think there's a big difference.   In the example of Dennis Smith Jr, this is a player that got shipped out to... New York. And remember, a player like that still has plenty of opportunity to prove that they deserve to be in the NBA. Whether that be through practice, other players getting injured, or even in garbage time. Because they're still competing against players of the same caliber.   So in my example, let's say a soccer player like Dennis Smith Jr gets shipped out to Saudi Arabia. Well, even if they are still young and even play well in games there's gonna be people who downplay it and say things like ""well the Saudi Arabian league isn't even a top 10 league in the world so he can't play like that against real competition"" or ""he hasn't even broke into his national team yet so he must not be good"". Then the years go by and this is what happened to their career. There's a ton of soccer teams and leagues in the world and trust me, this happens *a lot*.   When you think about soccer, it's such a global sport that you can imagine a single league in the same realm of like A, AA, AAA, and MLB in baseball. Except for instead of 4 there's like 200 each with their own reputation and skill level."
Is wat happened to Dennis Smith Jr in Dallas any different? He was shipped out to ensure luka was the primary ball handler. The yr before he was looked as a good rookie.
And trade Joe Harris for Dennis Smith Jr and sign J.Cole off the waivers
&gt; Bradley Beal will be traded for Dennis smith jr  what is wrong with you lmao
Mavs fans were looking forward to the Dennis Smith Jr. era
Dennis smith jr
It was obvious at draft time too: https://deanondraft.com/2017/06/22/is-dennis-smith-jr-a-loser/
"Wizards have a 93 ORTG when he plays. I.e. the Wizards are the worst offensive team in the league when Westbrook is on the court. Nobody on the Wizards has a lower ORTG apart from Anzejs Pasecniks who has played 6 minutes all season  93 ORTG puts him in good company with players like Marvin Bagley, Dennis Smith Jr and Cole Anthony. Except he's a 12 year veteran and they're all young players on bad teams"
"If the Raptors win, the Warriors should burn all of their championship banners and trade Curry to New York for Dennis Smith Jr."
"In all honesty, THJ was at least worth the protected 1st rounder we owe the Knicks in a few years. That means we got KP for this year's unprotected first rounder, Dennis Smith Jr. and expiring contracts we wouldn't have re-signed anyway.  Even if KP doesn't play more than sixty games a season for the remainder of his contract that's still one hell of a deal"
Tim Hardaway Jr. was at least worth the protected 1st rounder we owe the Knicks in a few years.   That means we got KP for this year's unprotected 1st rounder and Dennis Smith Jr. and nothing more aside from expirings we wouldn't have extended anyway.
There probably are.  A random dude like JJ Barea could put up 20ppg if he was the first option.  Dennis Smith JR put up 15ppg as a rookie and he's one of the worst players in the NBA.
I‚Äôd deadass take two of those right now over Dennis Smith Jr.
Rick don‚Äôt play no games. Ask Dennis smith jr. Luka and the bunch learned quick

&gt;To ~~improve~~ worsen their PG Depth the Orlando Magic should consider trading for Dennis Smith Jr  Fixed it for you
&gt;improve their PG Depth &gt;  trading for Dennis Smith Jr   pick one
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah‚Äôs bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson‚Äôs doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
Is Marvin Bagley really *that* bad that he‚Äôs being lumped in with Stanley Johnson and Dennis Smith Jr?
Bro i forget that dennis smith jr. is in the nba
We‚Äôre paying this man less than we‚Äôre paying Dennis Smith Jr.
Adam Morrison.  Josh Childress.  Dennis Smith Jr.  Frank Ntilikina.
Malik Monk and Dennis Smith Jr. I was so pissed when the Bulls took Markkanen instead of one of those guys in the draft.
"I sold my land on Justise Winslow Court last year. My current investment portfolio of Fultz, Marquese Chriss, and Dennis Smith Jr. is a mixed bag right now."
‚ÄúNobody has god given talents. Mine just so happens to be slanging this wood in my pants‚Äù -Dennis Smith Jr
I'll give you a whole Elfrid Payton and Dennis Smith Jr for George Hill
Is it a homer take to claim that THJ alone was worth the protected 1st round pick we owe the Knicks in a couple of years?  That turns KP basically into Dennis Smith Jr. and the unprotected 2021 1st round pick.
A good one by prime Dennis Smith Jr:  https://youtu.be/MRV_HFpLusI  Russ and Dame are going to have a lot of those hesi's also
so dennis smith jr and a wifi only brother printer won't get the deal done then?
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
"Aw damn I‚Äôve been loving Sexland sorry my man. I was just doing it off the top of my head, and didn‚Äôt think about him because Garland was last year  I studied the hell out of that draft because it was the first time in awhile the Mavs might have a top 3 or so pick. I had done *this* close to talking myself into how Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr would be awesome together lol. Our own Westbrook and Gobert hahaha."
"Luka didn't fit great along Dennis Smith Jr. with the Mavericks, either, and look what happened to him.  Bad fits are eminently fixable; you take the best player at your draft slot and either trade the draftee or the mismatched pieces around him to fix the fit.  This does, however, rely on having a competent front office."
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."
It kills me when I see people calling them one of the best NBA pods. I remember Duncan being particularly convinced that Danny Green and Dennis Smith Jr. were better than Devin Booker. Their scouting is just flat out bad.
&gt; Well funnily the Mavs had Dennis Smith Jr who wasn‚Äôt on board with Luka at al  Thats simply not true
"Well funnily the Mavs had Dennis Smith Jr who wasn‚Äôt on board with Luka at all, and they shipped his ass out ASAP.    Fox isn‚Äôt good enough to be pulling those strings."
Dennis smith Jr. feel like he was a force his rookie season and then disappeared
"If I were a rookie I'd rather go play for the warriors than the Timberwolves..... you get to learn from veterans like Steph and get yelled at by Draymond.  I feel bad for rookies who go to franchises that force them into 30 minute roles without development, and after a year or two of suffering they are basically out of the league.  Examples: \*Dennis Smith Jr, \*Josh Jackson (Ironically both are finding a new career in Detroit)"
Keep saying dumb shit to distract yourself from the big fat L Mason Plumlee and Dennis Smith Jr handed your sorry team

"&gt;  TJ McConnell, Dennis Smith Jr, Mason Plumlee   ah yes the usual suspects"
glad to see Dennis Smith Jr. getting a chance to play and making something of it.
"The three players to record a triple double tonight so far are Mason Plumlee, Dennis Smith Jr. and TJ McConnell (with steals!).      What even is basketball."
Dennis Smith Jr is an enigma
We got one Dennis Smith Jr for that wolves pick üëÄüëÄ
Dennis smith jr stay solid my.... friend
Adam Silver looking for a way to retroactively nix the Dennis Smith Jr trade since it was so unfair to the league's biggest market.
"Pretty sure this is the first time I've seen Dennis Smith Jr on /r/nba this entire season so far. Dude would have highlights nonstop his rookie year, and only now he finally puts up a highlight."
"It's ridiculous... fans willing to give up on Porzi≈Üƒ£is after 1.25 seasons is insane.   Also any team with Luka will not be tanking for a top 5 pick. They will be a 30 win team still and get a 8-10 pick. Would Luka, Brunson and a top 10 pick even be good? Chances are we draft another Dennis Smith Jr player.   Also if we get rid of Porzi≈Üƒ£is who are we signing in free agency? Dallas' biggest free agent signings in 20 years have been Chandler Parsons, a AARP Vince Carter, 12 ppg Shawn Marion, Erick Dampier, Monta Ellis, DeAndre Jordan (2nd attempt), Wes Matthews post ACL, and Harrison Barnes to a max contract. Porzi≈Üƒ£is has been better than all of those guys but gets more hate than all of them... And KP has hardly been the first player making max money. Parsons and Barnes both got max contracts and played worse than Porzi≈Üƒ£is has. Dampier was our highest paid player during Dirk's prime and was a bench player."
"""Dennis Smith Jr is a better prospect than Devin Booker""  ""Danny Green is a better shooting guard than Devin Booker""  I'm okay being a low-IQ fan if those are high-IQ takes."
The players are RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr
RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr
Wow he's outplaying Dennis Smith Jr.
I was telling anyone who would listen that Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr was a solid core to build around.
"it's a joke about the Porzingis trade  the actual trade was Dennis Smith Jr, 2 firsts and some filler for Tim Hardaway Jr, Porzingis and some filler  meta joke about everyone's hot takes on that trade from this week calling THJ the asset instead of Porzingis"
Dennis Smith Jr? Didn‚Äôt you guys draft him?  Edit: oh. I get it.
"1 on 1, but it scrubs vs former MVPs  Like Cody Martin vs Micheal Jordan  Or Alex Len vs Shaq  Or Dennis smith jr vs Steve nash"
Maybe with Detroit and a package revolved around Dennis Smith Jr
"Dude, the mavs gave up Dennis Smith Jr and picks for KP, THJ and Burke.   Signing KP to a max was the real blunder, but they kind of had to roll the dice on that. Maybe in the middle of next season of after they can trade him"
They might be able to get Dennis Smith Jr and a late round first pick. Who says no?

If you can get Dennis Smith Jr to work as well you're definitely doing something right
Dennis Smith Jr. I forgot...duh!
Troy Weaver won‚Äôt get it because the pistons are bad but he‚Äôs been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who‚Äôs now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
"Russell Westbrook.  His draft was the first draft I really followed, and I was 100% he'd be a worse player than Jerryd Bayless and DJ Augustin. Then he became my favourite non Piston ever.  &amp;#x200B;  Dennis Smith Jr. is kinda the opposite, I saw the athletism and I was sure he would overcome his flaws because of the Westbrook example, turns out I overrated his athletism and underrated how crazy the Westbrook developpment was (from back up shooting guard to all star point guard in 4 years)"
How dare you disrespect Dennis Smith Jr. like that
"The spacing and talent that Lamelo has opens up the floor for him to operate in ways Luka never had due to roster construction. Luka had a near-death Deandre Jordan, a ""supposed"" NBA player in Dennis Smith Jr, a Wesley Matthews that played like JR Smith, and a Harrison ""horse-blinders"" Barnes that passed maybe once out of a drive all season."
Definitely would rather have Danny Green. And Dennis Smith Jr. is for sure a better prospect.
"Nobody averaged 30ppg in the 40s, so I doubt Dennis Smith Jr would."
Put Dennis Smith Jr. on a team in the 1940s and he probably could average 30
"I went to my first and so far only Mavs game in 2012 but didn‚Äôt appreciate bball at the time. Didn‚Äôt properly start following the NBA until 2017 when I was all hyped for Dennis Smith jr (still am, I believe in you bro)."
"Meanwhile Mavs fans who have been around for a while realize when, before we were able to trade up for Luka, we were like ‚ÄúDennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Mo Bamba is a pretty solid core for the team, right‚Äù"
True but look where they are now. Dennis Smith Jr. is gone. DeAndre Jordan is gone. They used that salary flexibility to sign Julius Randle and not much else because players weren't interested in playing with the Knicks. Porzingis was the only attraction to playing in NYC for other players and they shipped him out. He was literally their only ticket out of a 25 win seasons.
Dennis Smith Jr had a weird leave of absence a week or so before the trade for KP. that might be what youre thinking.
And for some reason they won't actually grab him. Weird. Guess it's hard to top Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2nd.
"I hate Dennis Smith Jr. He is so absolutely garbage. He's fast but gets blown by constantly, he makes dumb shot choices, he isn't a smart ball handler, there's nothing good about his game. I wish we would have just let Rose walk"
The Pistons now have Josh Jackson and Dennis Smith Jr Detroit definitely won the 2017 draft.
"the players that don't have good fundamentals and rely only on their athleticism in the NBA, would probably foul out in the Euroleague super quick. A couple of games like that, and that player isn't getting anymore minutes, period.  For example, and I like the guy, but Dennis Smith Jr. is not at the level of skill where he would get minutes in any top European club."
Dennis Smith JR ;)
"&gt; He's still developing but is a solid contributor.  No, this is the problem...he's not.   He's a bad NBA player and he's not getting better.  This is like last year when I was on the ""Bryn Forbes is terrible"" train and nobody would fucking agree.   Just because somebody wears our jersey doesn't mean he's good and we have to talk ourselves into him.   You watch a guy like Tyrese Haliburton or SGA and it's just immediately clear that they understand the game of basketball and can play above-average minutes in this league.   We know what guys who start out like this look like long-term.  Here is 538's player projection for Lonnie...  Notice the WAR value they projected for this year? So far, his actual WAR is -1.1   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/lonnie-walker-iv/  In reality, if this level of play continues, he's more similar to Emmanuel Mudiay or Dennis Smith Jr or Ish Smith.  The track record of guys who play this poorly in year three is bad."
"The day after the Knicks traded away Dennis Smith Jr, the last player active with them from our trade, Porzingis goes off for 27/13/4 and 6 blocks and Hardaway Jr. notches 24 points on 15 shots. Love to see it.   Also where are the motherfuckers at who started their ‚ÄúJosh Richardson isn‚Äôt actually a good player takes‚Äù?? 18/5/8 and got us a BADLY needed clutch bucket, clutch rebound and 2 clutch free throws! Let‚Äôs go!!"
"An anonymous GM said this about him last year  &gt;""Dennis Smith Jr is supremely athletic and can be a gifted scorer as an attack-style ballhandler. However, he‚Äôs an average shooter and non-passer. Smith doesn‚Äôt have a clue how to make others better. Plus he‚Äôs an indifferent defender, meaning when the mood strikes him"""
"Poorly. Dennis Smith Jr. just isn't good. At this point, this is who he is. He is a fringe player at best that will more than likely be out of the league in a few years time unless he somehow has a dramatic improvement."
"Dennis Smith Jr is dead salary, and we aren't done making deals yet. More pieces are going to be moving since we have so much excess cap and favorable players on workable deals."
Damn I had totally forgot about Dennis smith jr. what happened to him? He looked real promising on the mavs
Man nobody want wants Dennis Smith Jr. He was decent his first year too.
dennis smith jr
I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs a clone of Dennis smith jr.
"Dennis Smith jr has a vertical advantage over Fox. But Fox is much faster, A better first step a better ball handler by very high margins and is far more shifty. Also better size."
De'Aaron Fox is who Dennis Smith Jr. thinks he is.
Dennis Smith jr is very aesthetic and low impact  Jokic's scoring game isn't aesthetic even though his passing is
Dennis Smith Jr.
"mavs knicks rivalry is hilarious  mavs: luv the knicks, gave us tingus pingus and hardaway for dennis smith jr, would you like trey burke for rj barrett  knicks: this is  lakers-celtics"
"&gt; decent averages  Uhh... did you and I read the same post?   In 2018-2019 (age 23) he ranked 127th out of 129th in FG%. Only Spencer Dinwiddie and Dennis Smith Jr. were worse than him. That was his star season where he exploded in the playoffs.   In 2018-2019 he ranked 118th out of 120th in FG%. Only Kevin Knox(lol) and Justin Holliday were worse than him. That upcoming offseason he got a damn near 20M per year deal.   The point is, he WASN'T decently average. He was one of the worst in the NBA efficiency wise."
And you cant forget Dennis Smith Jr. He hasnt had any amazing dunks this year but he still gets up there.
I hear dennis Smith jr might be available in the off season........
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
"Also, who am I kidding? Lebron would totally recruit Dennis to his team. A guy who would Co-sign on JR Smith and Dwight, each at a time with the NBA at large seemed fed up with them... would definitely be trying to get Dennis to sign with Klutch and come play with him!"
"Yeah he looked pretty bad the season back from his patellar tear but if you watch his G-League highlights and look at his stats he's clearly regained that burst he lost, and his jumper is smooth af.  Lin would be better than a lot of backup guards in the NBA right now. I'd easily take him over Wanamaker, Teague, Lou Will, Dennis Smith Jr, MCW, Dellavadova to name a few."
What up it‚Äôs dennis smith jr
I‚Äôll try for our team:  ‚Ä¢ Jerami Grant ‚Ä¢ Mason Plumlee ‚Ä¢ Saddiq Bey ‚Ä¢ Isaiah Stewart ‚Ä¢ Wayne Ellington ‚Ä¢ Dennis Smith Jr. ‚Ä¢ Saben Lee ‚Ä¢ Josh Jackson ‚Ä¢ Frank Jackson ‚Ä¢ Rodney Mcgruder
dennis smith jr.. tore 1 acl and then docs found he had 2 in same knee.   but this was in high school and hes a basketball player
"Dennis Smith Jr. Really want to see him succeed.    Also anyone that is being or has been affected by injuries i.e. Fultz, Klay, D Rose, etc."
"It's the G League, release the name. Who is the biggest name in the G League right now that would be protected by the league? Tacko Fall? Dennis Smith Jr?"
Dennis Smith Jr
followed by Dennis smith Jr    but ive seen Josh being decent though
"not the guy/girl you were responding to but uhhh let me try for fun.   **Yes/fairly certain are better than Curry:**.  Simmons   Schroder   Conley   Nunn   Holiday   Lowry   Doncic   Ball/Bledsoe   Beverely/Jackson   CP3   Fox   Brogdon   Shai   Dejounte Murray   Westbrook   Harden   Wall    **Maybe:**   Rose (this one I'm not sure about)   Curry (is Curry &gt; Curry or is Curry &lt; Curry on D? idk)   Coby White   Whoever tf is the Magic's starting guard, is it MCW?   Murray   Morant    **No:**   Trae   Garland   Dennis Smith Jr   Rozier   Dame"
Dennis smith jr so far
"We have a ton honestly, half of the 2011 team feels like it was made up of guys like that. Tyson Chandler is the biggest one. Peja, Vince Carter, and Monta Ellis are also all good examples.  The fanbase still has a soft spot for Dennis Smith Jr. as well despite the circumstances leading to him getting traded."
"I thought Dennis Smith Jr was about to be the truth when I was watching him mixtapes in high school.   Even told dude I was about to jump out the gym when they put him in 2K ""in a couple years"" and he liked the tweet."
"I like how you say ""young prospect"" to make it sound better than ""Dennis Smith jr"""
"Ok heres mine:  1-15: The Big 15  16. Carmelo  17. Shved  18. CleAnthony Early  19. Mike Breen   20. Leon Rose  21. Marcus Morris   22. Westbrook  23. Dennis Smith Jr  24. The 2nd rounder we used to trade for Rose  25-30. Idrc   Last, James Dolan and Steve mills"
And the biggest change in the roster from last year to this year is a guy acquired for Dennis Smith Jr and a 2nd round pick
"Yep, he made the Kristaps trade worth it, considering the Hardaway jr. salary dump and Dennis Smith Jr. is who landed them Rose."
"Shaq: ""isn't that Dennis Smith Jr"""
Dennis Smith Jr.
"Dennis Smith Jr is almost certainly done. His one big asset is his athleticism; but he‚Äôs still small, is terrible shooter and defender. What he should have done is made the effort to play alongside Luka and move to the 2 spot and get open looks and easy shots. He would have been better off and had time to develop. Instead, he pushed to be the number 1 and got traded and hasn‚Äôt been sent to a team where he can develop. You rarely see players blossom on bad teams unless they were exceptional to begin with; they get way more pressure to carry a bigger load right away and don‚Äôt get time to develop or have mentors"
Dennis Smith Jr. is still in the league. He plays for Detroit.
Dennis Smith Jr. mark my fucking words   Oh shit I didn‚Äôt realise OP also had him
Dennis Smith Jr and a second round pick
"Yeah, the person who watches every Timberwolves game is talking out of his ass with an unbiased opinion of Ant's bounce.  His vertical is very good. But ""elite"" is traditionally reserved for the top 5-10 dudes in the league. I don't think he's THAT good of a vertical leaper (it's hard to be when you're 230 at 6'4"").  When I think ""elite"" I think Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Lavine, Dennis Smith Jr., etc."
"Trade for Derrick Jones Jr, Cassius Stanley and Dennis Smith Jr. The team will still tank, but there's going to be lots of highlight dunks to keep the fans interested. Add Poku, Bol Bol and Tacko as well, and watch ticket sales sky rocket."
"Because he is literally 99th percentile in athleticism in all the categories a basketball player should be. But I never said he would be the superstar just that maybe all of his raw physical qualities will translate to that. But Dennis Smith Jr. also jumped out of the gym and he busted hard, doesn't mean that wont happen to Ant either.  But nice try to pull out of context.   Unlike you I can admit that LaMelo is a good player like I did many this in this thread while you physically cannot even say that he's on the level of LaMelo (because he is)."
"Mavs: Y‚Äôall want Dennis Smith Jr for KP?  Knicks: You‚Äôre gonna have to give us more than that  Mavs: What if we threw in a couple firsts?  Knicks: Shiiiit in that case let‚Äôs give you THJ and Trey Burke too, that‚Äôs way too much  Mavs: No takebaksies"
Dennis Smith Jr has now been traded for Kristnaps Porzingis and Derrick Rose.
To think we traded him for Dennis Smith Jr...Knicks are 21-8 when he plays.
"In 2019, if someone told you that the Knicks FO would turn Dennis Smith Jr into prime Derrick Rose, what would you say?"
"As a Mavs fan, going from Dirk to Luka is an unfair transition.   Before we traded up to get him, the discussion on /r/Mavericks were like ‚ÄúDennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Mo Bamba would be a solid core, right?‚Äù"
Dennis Smith Jr. was one of them ones that I had high hopes for. Man...
They had dennis smith jr averaging 15/7 as a rookie they didn‚Äôt want a pg luka was a sg/sf
"""Everybody has god given talents. Mine just so happens to be slangin this wood in my pants"" - ~~Dennis Smith Jr.~~ Wilt"
Dennis Smith Jr by Luka
Dennis Smith Jr
"I'm not a Mavs fan, so I wasn't doing anything LOL. Still seems pretty clear to me that the Mavs won the trade.   Dennis Smith Jr was an overrated bust. DeAndre Jordan was old, and the Knicks waived Wes Matthews, which just leaves a few draft picks.  On top of Kristaps, the Mavs got the next best player in the trade (THJ), plus Burke and Lee were decent rotation pieces."
The Mavs got THJ also and were able to dump Dennis Smith Jr. Still a W trade for them IMO
"Sure the picks wouldve been nice to have, but Hardaway Jr for Dennis Smith Jr (even though I love DSJ) was easily worth it. Porzingis hasnt really worked out due to injury even though the flashes have been there, but THJ has been awesome for us"
Yeah we were so disappointed with our 30/10 player in the bubble last season - Hows Dennis Smith Jr?
"Don't sleep on Moses ""Wilt"" Brown. Please don't let him partner up with Dennis ""Rose"" Smith Jr. It'd be the next Penny and Shaq."
It‚Äôs funny because dennis smith jr did eventually become a Knick. And was arguably even worse than Frank lol
"First year Luka had to share the ball with NYK legend Dennis Smith Jr for like half the year until he got traded for KP and then had to play on a team that gave away it's entire starting lineup, so that brought a lot of his stats down lol and last season Luka had more assists per 100 possessions and the same amount per 36 minutes. Granted last year Trae was the better passer, I don't think it's as wide as the stats show for this year considering the context of the teams makeup."
"Yeah I'm gonna take Luka's side on this.   Obviously I can draw many conclusions about their personal lives after watching them play sports on tv occasionally. Here it is: one of them doesn't smile. The other doesn't not smile. Ergo, KP sucks and should be traded for Dennis Smith jr."
My point is in the trade they didn‚Äôt get any prospects. Dennis smith jr ain‚Äôt a real prospect
And all it cost us was Dennis Smith Jr and Charlottes 2nd rounder. Absolute pennies.
"We've straight up won it already. Randle is better than Porzingis, the cap space cleared also allowed us to sign and then trade Marcus Morris which got us Immanuel Quickley and the Detroit 2nd this year, which will be 31/32, we traded Dennis Smith Jr for Derrick Rose and we still have two incoming first round picks from them."
Frank doesn't feel as bad anymore  because realistically it was him or Dennis Smith Jr and we dropped Dennis Smith Jr now. Of course Donovan Mitchell was on the board but we couldn't have the Knicks being that good.
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
That Knicks Mavs trade was pretty not good for both sides.  Mavs aren't sure on what to do with KP and the Knicks only have the picks left from that trade.  I guess the Knicks won (probably lost less hard) because they used Dennis Smith Jr to get Rose.
"Mavs traded Dennis Smith Jr + some future picks for KP, THJ and Burke. Those guys are solid contributors, way better than the former- not sure what you‚Äôre talking about"
"Seeing how what you received in the actual trade was Wes Matthew's (waived), Dennis Smith Jr (traded), DeAndre Jordan (left via FA), and 2 draft picks.    Really, all you have so far is Rose in the latter part of his career and two draft picks for a former all-star.  Congrats, you really did win the trade."
"Right, because Dennis Smith Jr worked out so well."
"Lets see... We gave up Dennis Smith Jr. (no longer on the Knicks), Deandre Jordan (no longer on the Knicks), Wes Matthews (No longer on the Knicks) and two FRP's that - despite what braindead Knicks fans believe, will not be in the lotto. We got KP, an All Star Player who is worth that 'haul' plus much more, and Tim Hardaway Jr. who has become a key contributor. Yeah I'd say we won the trade. Only delusional Knicks fans could see that and believe they won. But keep defending your shitty franchise, I kinda pity you guys."
"Look we already gave them Dennis Smith Jr and he was a lottery pick, you don't want a 2nd round guy like Brunson! Come on Dolan, don't sell yourself short, shoot for the stars"
Suns fans remember ‚ÄúDennis Smith Jr is better than Devin Booker‚Äù shit tier takes
"Mavs drafting isn't awful.  Mavs just haven't chosen to utilize the draft at all during most of the Dirk era. It's hard to have an impressive drafting record when you trade away all your first rounders, pick for other teams and draft in the 50's in the second round. Dennis Smith Jr was essentially our first real lottery pick since 2000."
Definitely Dennis Smith Jr. He looked like the next d rose in college. He passed the eye test easy and his stats also were good for college. The only red flag were character concerns.
Wasn‚Äôt that Dennis smith jr
"That we would be a contender with Dennis Smith Jr., Nerlens Noel and Justin Anderson as our ""core""."
"They 1000% could have gotten Tim Hardaway Jr from the Knicks for Dennis Smith Jr and a future first round pick (they actually originally called the Knicks about THJ and the Knicks were like ""Sure but how do you feel about Porzingis?""). In fact, they probably could have gotten him for one or the other. Their decision to max Porzingis before ever seeing him play for them after he just missed a season and a half is a completely different thing."
"That‚Äôs exactly what I hate about coaching comparisons. On the Ty Lue thread the other day people were saying ‚ÄúOf course Lue is a top 5 coach his teams have never finished outside of the top 4 in their conference‚Äù completely ignoring the fact that the only teams hes coached had Lebron fucking James and Kawhi/PG.    I like to grade coaches more off their expectations with their given talent rather than just randomly looking at what the end of season results are while ignoring everything else. Teams like the Nets, Bucks, Lakers, Clippers are going to be a playoff contender no matter who is coaching them because their teams are incredibly talented. Give any coach a roster with a starting lineup of Harrison Barnes, Wes Mathews, Yogi Ferrel, Dennis Smith Jr., and a 40 year old Dirk and see how many games they win lol."
"Monty wasn‚Äôt considered top tier after his stint in New Orleans. Even Snyder was at risk of being fired as early as the start of this season if he didn‚Äôt perform.   Your roster matters a lot. Carlisle has kept the Mavs competitive when they had no right being so. Cuban broke up the 2011 Mavs team right after they won and has gone as far as saying that‚Äôs one of his biggest mistakes since owning the team.   I mean, just consider their first round drafts that followed their championship season:   In 2012, traded the 17th pick (Tyler zeller) for the 24th (Jared Cunningham), 33rd (Bernard James), and 34th (Jae Crowder).   Had no draft pick in 2013.   In 2014, traded the 13th pick (Kelly Olynyk) for Lucas Nogueira and two future seconds.   In 2015, drafted Justin anderson with the 21st pick. Anderson was traded two years later.   Had no 2016 pick.   In 2017, drafted Dennis Smith Jr. with the 9th pick. Was traded in 2019.   In 2018, they get Luka.   That‚Äôs a pretty shitty record sans Luka lol. You can‚Äôt expect to be much better than average when you‚Äôre drafting like that. A big part of why they were even competitive is because of Carlisle."
Zingers contract has been disappointing for sure but   1) Absolutely worth the risk imo  2) They got Hardaway who has been huge  3) They traded Dennis Smith fuckin JR for them
Outside some late firsts I‚Äôd rather have Tim hardaway jr than Dennis smith jr. The problem is the cap hit for pozingis. They can hope that someone else‚Äôs problem matches up.
"Basically what happened with Dennis Smith Jr. Obviously way less talented, but he was the guy before Luka showed up and was gone within a season."
"I‚Äôm not sure what you were watching but they certainly let Curry play 1 on 1 for the majority of the series . You‚Äôd think if he were getting doubled and tripled curry could get above 7 assist especially during those finals games when it matters most but nope not even with the amazing shooters he played with. Even if the Cavs were playing let‚Äôs focus on Curry and Curry only who‚Äôs going to stop him Kyrie Irving , jr Smith , Kevin Love ? Stop it ! As I stated Shaun Livingston played much better when Curry was off the floor , not next to curry but when curry was on the bench . For those games Curry had an average plus minus of -5 , he was hurting his team more than helping them. I‚Äôm using stats because what else am I going to use to prove he isn‚Äôt unguardable‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs getting shut down by Delly a nobody and Irving a below average defender! imagine he played in a more physical era where guys like Gary Payton and Dennis Johnson could hound him the second he crosses the half court line . Curry has some major flaws all together especially on the defensive side of the ball but that‚Äôs a story for another day . I‚Äôm just sick of people overstating how great he is when he couldn‚Äôt even lead his team to the playoffs this season ‚Ä¶. Yet people were calling for him to win the mvp ? absolutely delusional thoughts by fan boys. To make matters worse people try disrespecting the true all time great players by saying Curry is a top 10 player of all time , someone needs to stop the madness because 7 prime years doesn‚Äôt get you close to being a top 20 let alone top 10 all time great player . Curry has had great success in the nba and in the playoffs for sure he‚Äôs a no doubt HOFer just need to pump the breaks with saying he‚Äôs unguardable and he‚Äôs an all time top 10 player because those are such bogus , biased narratives that completely ignore the nba‚Äôs history !"
Ehh the #21 pick this year and whatever late pick in 2023 doesn't seem like that much value in hindsight either. And Dennis Smith Jr busted as well so its as if both sides got weak returns
"This is the same guy that traded away Steve Nash no? Dirk got them that ring, overall the mavs have been doing shit like signing willie caullie Stein and drafting Dennis smith JR"
"It only cost them two first round picks, Dennis Smith Jr and some expiring contracts, and part of the ""cost"" was taking on Tim Hardaway Jr, who has been a key player for them for two years. The Mavs legitimately got the two best players out of the deal. Calling it one of the worst trades ever made is nuts."
Maybe Tingus being traded for Dennis Smith Jr was actually closer to fair than we thought.  (Jk he wasn‚Äôt terrible today)
wasnt the biggest piece going the other way Dennis Smith Jr? seems like even if KP flames out it was worth it with the emergence of Tim hardaway jr
Might be time to trade KP. Maybe get a young guy like dennis smith jr and a few first round picks.
Only time Dennis Smith Jr will ever be on a list with good players like that.
You forgot Dennis Smith Jr.
Dennis Smith Jr also has not stayed solid
It's like when he name dropped Dennis Smith Jr. out of existence
Didn‚Äôt he mention Dennis Smith Jr too?  Edit: Just realized he is no longer on the Knicks
But is Dennis Smith Jr staying solid?
"I've long thought that he and Luka have shit chemistry, and that Luka outright dislikes KP. Klieber is like a shittier version of KP, and Luka passes it to him with way less hesitation. I remember a bunch of plays from this season and last where KP was open and Luka chose someone else, or just kept dribbling.  I do recall KP having a lot of baggage, coming from NYC, in terms of his personality, attitude, whatever. He's vastly superior to Dennis Smith Jr, but I think both thought they'd be number one options and ended up becoming resentful."
I call it the Dennis Smith Jr trade
Not that Dennis Smith Jr did much for us either.   It was really the Tim Hardaway Jr for Derrick Rose trade. Win-win :)
Dennis Smith Jr was the major part of the trade from Dallas Jordan was the side piece. Even when the trade happened everyone thought the Mavs fleeced the Knicks
wait are you fucking kidding? LOL dennis smith jr and a first?!??
How‚Äôs Dennis Smith Jr doing?
Paying with Dennis Smith Jr is buying high?
"Dennis Schroder, in the fine tradition of JR Smith in 2013, is watching his money burn in front of his eyes"
Dennis Smith Jr. is a better prospect. Danny Green is more of a winning player.
That Dennis Smith Jr. &gt; De'Aaron Fox
It was a high speed layup with two defenders on him. Dennis should've made it but that wasn't a JR Smith like blunder as Bron's reactions would make you believe.
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
I thought Dennis Smith Jr would be a top 5 point guard by now and he'd be the face of the mavericks
I thought dante exum and dennis Smith jr were going to be stars....I like to think I'm smarter now when it comes to prospect evaluations.
Derrick Rose and Dennis Smith Jr
"Three years ago, you would‚Äôve listed Dennis Smith Jr. who cares? Until one of them wins the chip by leading their team, they are all as good as their teams are."
Thank you Dennis Smith Jr
How is Dennis Smith Jr faring? Was LeGM right?
"When our subreddit was hyped for our young ""core"" of Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes and Nerlens Noel"
10 minutes before the 2018 nba draft most Mavs fans had resigned to a. Future of Dennis Smith Jr and Mo Bamba
"Yeah I should clarify that they‚Äôre probably fans that jumped on board because of Luka and have no idea how amazing of a coach Carlisle has proved to be over the years.  A lot of those new Luka era fans failed to realize that he got on the team in the first place because we were a bad team. So they assumed that us continuing to be bad when we got Luka was because of Rick which is just....wrong. Luka is great but weve only gotten better because we significantly bolstered the roster actually got Rick some more pieces to work with. It‚Äôs already crazy to think that Luka was on a team with Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Dirk - feels like ages ago."
"Centerpiece was Dennis Smith, Jr."
"That‚Äôs exactly what the Mavs did. Draft Dennis Smith Jr as the potential next star of the Mavs, only to trade him away after drafting Luka."
Mavs had Dennis Smith Jr who they immediately traded away when they knew Luka was better.
Top 5 Lakers of all time:  5. JR Smith  4. Dennis Rodman  3. Elden Campbell  2. Robert Sacre  1. Kwame Brown
The Mavericks got Tim Hardaway Jr. for Dennis Smith!! What a genius trade!
Dennis Smith Jr?
"&gt;Yeah, but is it quitting on the team when the coach doesn't believe in you enough to let you make a few decisions and stop micromanaging  Basically, you're saying Rondo is in the ""Dennis Smith Jr"" category instead of the ""Jason Kidd"" category."
"Dennis Smith Jr, and I also held out hope for an unreasonably long time for Thon Maker."
"Josh Jackson, Kris Dunn, Dennis Smith Jr  Maybe not superstars but I thought they‚Äôd all be at least all star level"
"If that player becomes Devin Booker it's absolutely worth it. If that player is Dennis Smith Jr., it isn't."
Dennis Smith Jr  he went to the G League.
"team USA is gonna be running a lineup of Dennis Smith Jr, Jerome Robinson, Jarret Culver, Dean Wade, and Tyler Zeller at this rate"
"I really enjoyed watching the 2017-2018 Mavs with Barnes, old Dirk, and Dennis Smith Jr.  Part of the fun was that I had zero expectations for that team, so I could just watch the games without getting too wrapped up on whether they won or lost."
"I mean, if we retain Frank Ntilikina and trade for Dennis Smith Jr., the two of them with Elfrid Payton could combine to put up 85 points to squeeze out one more win."
Dennis Smith Jr
Dennis Smith Jr is definitely on the list.
Kinda take your pick with him and Dennis Smith Jr imo
"Recent History shows the 9th pick as a real mixed bag, for what's its worth, all these players are still playing today (Vonleh might not last past this season). Only 3 of them were basically back ups from the start.  2010: Gordon Hayward (Utah, signed an extension) 15.6/4.5/3.5, made an all star game; 685 games played  2011: Kemba Walker (Charlotte, signed an extension) 19.9/3.8/5.4, multiple all star games, an all nba team; 704 games played  2012: Andre Drummond (Pistons, signed an extension) 14.5/13.7/1.4, all star, all nba, rebounding leader; 645 games played  2013: Trey Burke - starter, then quickly role player  2014: Noah Vonleh - role player, now third stringer  2015: Frank Kaminsky - role player  2016: Jakob Poetl - role player, current starter (usually)  2017: Dennis Smith Jr - starter, now role player  2018: Kevin Knox - role player  2019: Rui Hachimura - starter  2020: Deni Advija - role player"
Who‚Äôs Dennis? Smith Jr?
Doesn‚Äôt Dennis Smith Jr. have like an additional ACL or something in that direction?
"When the Mavs got screwed by luck and ended with the 5th pick, our fanbase was already debating very hard between the likes of Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr. to pair with Dennis Smith Jr.   The future looked bleak and we were prepared for more years of tanking.  Thank you Vlade for making the opportunity for a trade possible. Hands down best GM in Mavs franchise history."
"He had an elite team in Europe, but got drafted to probably the worst team in the league, with the least potential. Suns had Booker, Kings had Fox and Mavs had fucking Dennis Smith Jr, look at where he is now."
Don't forget Dennis Smith Jr. being mad about Luka getting more touches than him lol
Dennis Smith Jr. looked great in summer league too.
Dennis Smith Jr
Dennis smith JR
"Interestingly enough it goes the other way as well. Dennis Smith Jr has two ACLs in each knee, he tore one and was dunking two weeks after the surgery.   Man, I was so fucking high on that kid. What happened?"
Dennis Smith Jr
I still believe in Dennis Smith Jr
That's sophomore year Dennis Smith Jr numbers lmao
"Tbh I really don't see how we did not win the KP trade. We traded Dennis smith jr., two first round picks and two expiring contracts for KP, THJ, Lee and Burke. Basically two first round picks for KP and THJ. I can't see how they both aren't worth at least a first round pick plus more. KP's value is at an all time low but some teams are still willing to bet on him if we trade him just like teams are still willing to bet on ben fucking simmons."
"This me but also Robert Wadlow (Height), Iverson (Swagger), and Dennis Smith Jr (Wood)"
"&gt;Only Rondo and Dennis Smith Jr did not like him from what I recall at least.  Well reportedly Luka didn't like him either. The Carlisle tweet above could be true, but the cynic could say it's just good PR after departing.   Put it this way, if you had a player like Luka would you honestly leave on your own?"
&gt;  Only Rondo and Dennis Smith Jr did not like him from what I recall at least.  I guess you missed that recent report
"This account is absurdly dumb, they gave up nothing and aside from KP got a 20ppg player in hardaway. Do you follow basketball or just post on Reddit? How devastated the mavs must be for losing Dennis Smith jr"
lol honestly it'd be kinda funny if trae was playing behind dennis smith jr
6‚Äô3 is considered good height for the point as long as you don‚Äôt have T-Rex arms (see: Dennis Smith Jr)
‚ÄúMavs shouldn‚Äôt draft Luka. He doesn‚Äôt fit with promising rookie Dennis Smith Jr.‚Äù
Dennis smith jr
"I once went to a Summer League game to watch Lonzo/Tatum/Dennis Smith Jr etc play and ended up seeing Denvel Valentine and Cameron Payne during their shootaround before the game started.   I shit you not they missed about 20/22 shots and I literally thought to myself that these guys will be out of the league in a couple years time.   Denzel Valentine is still Denzel Valentine but my god I would've never thought that Cameron Payne would be the leading scorer in a Conference Finals game, huge kudos to his growth"
"Odom was depressed and on drugs while he was here... I'm not entirely sure what else Carlisle could've done. He tried to work with him and put him in positions to succeed but at the end of the day Lamar Odom did not want to be here.   Rondo he was a hard ass with, but to Rick's credit, we were like 25-10 prior to the Rondo trade, on pace for a 58-60 win season, our best since the Championship. We trade for Rondo and he wanted full control of the offense, despite what we had already been doing being effective. We finish the year like 25-20 under Rondo and limp to a 50 win record despite the very good start. Yes Carlisle butted heads with Rondo, but Carlisle showed he was producing more wins that the Rondo led offense.   Tyson wanted to come back, so did Carlisle and Dirk, Cuban ultimately passed on Tyson twice. What was Rick supposed to do? Buy the team from Cuban and re-sign Tyson himself? They all lobbied for Tyson to stay, Rick publicly called him the best Center in Mavericks history.   Players have been vocal about not liking him, which is valid, but the three examples you provided are not great. All of them were either out of his control, or in the case of Rondo, his approach proved to lead to better wins.   Also we lost in 4 to the eventual Western Conference Champions in 4, but it was one of the closest sweeps ever. We lost 3 of the games by a combined 10 or so points. G1 was a last second buzzer beater from 3 by Durant, then the other two were like 4-5 point losses. Not to mention we had lost Tyson and our starters were 32-37 years old playing in a condensed season and fatigued a lot more than the younger Thunder. Did you watch the series or did you go to basketball reference and see we got swept and assumed Rick was a bad coach? Like I said, the series was a lot closer than the outcome suggests, look at the boxscore and play by play, super close games and we had leads in the 4th quarter in 3 of the 4 games, OKC was a great team that year. Go watch the 2014 first round series or the 2016 first round series. Rick coached circles around the 61 win Spurs and took them to 7 with Samuel Dalembert, Jose Calderon and old Dirk as his best players. 2016 we stole a game from the best team the Thunder have put together while starting fat Raymond Felton, Zaza Pachulia, 37 year old Dirk and Wes Matthews his first year back from his torn ACL. Rick has coached some pretty mediocre teams to the playoffs and made the series way more competitive than they should've been. This was largely due to stay competitive during Dirk's twilight to his career. If we had full on rebuilt Rick wouldn't have had those first round exits.   Lastly, you can fault Rick for a lot of things but not getting enough out of role players is the absolute last thing on that list. He has made so many washed up or mediocre players look great in his system. Old Raymond Felton and Mike James, Brandon Wright, Deron Williams, Brandon Bass, Dwight Powell, Justin Anderson, Dennis Smith Jr., Yogi Ferrell, Roddy Beauboius, DeShawn Stevenson, JJ Barea... All of those guys were out of the league or way worse the second they left the Mavs. Carlisle is an incredible coach at getting every inch out of role players. I'd argue his worst trait is his inability to manage star egos. He lucked out that Dirk had no ego or even Harrison Barnes, but he's struggled with players who had egos/tempers, Chandler Parsons, Luka, Salah Mejri etc...   No one is saying Rick is perfect and he's very much an old coach in a new coaches world, but do you even watch him? All of your critiques are not really true."
"Its not the same story.  Our starting lineup before Luka was: a rookie Dennis smith jr,W Matthews,Barnes,DFS before he got good and and an old Dirk.Our bench was also ass.  Yall have right now Siakam an all star,Lowry and Vanvleet 2 borderline all stars,OG Anunoby and Powell before u traded him for Gary Trent Jr.  A team like this dont deserve a top pick because they shouldnt even be at the bottom in the 1st place."
"Also, with Detroit, they will likely get another high selection tomorrow, along with the fact that they‚Äôre very willing to take up reclamation projects (see Jahlil Okafor, Dennis Smith Jr, etc). Their willingness to do that, such as Houston did with Kevin Porter Jr, could lead to them finding multiple gems though smart deals. Plus, they have a lot of seconds to work with thanks to the Cory Joseph and other trades."
"Lol, but why keep picks when you do stuff like pick Dennis Smith Jr when Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, John Collins and OG Anunoby are all still on the board?"
Simmons being all star over Dennis Smith Jr is highway robbery let alone Trae
"JKidd, Rondo, Darren Collison, Dennis Smith Jr just with the Mavs had problems with him. JKidd and him made up later but Rondo famously quit on the team in the middle of a playoff game because he and Carlisle beefed so much"
Dennis Smith Jr   Ron Baker  Frank Ntilikina
Mavs should trade him back for Dennis Smith Jr.
"Ask any mavs fan, rick was a tough coach, especially with point guards. Many players even before luka came, had problems with him. I think the most famous was rondo. he tried to improve on that, for example when he visited dennis smith jr, kp, luka in slovenia, etc. I think the best way to describe rick is that he was the classic great coach that wasnt a big people person. I wouldnt be  suprised if a assistant coach, mosley was the new coach. I am sure that if silas didnt leave last year to houston, he would have been head coach"
Send him to Detroit and see how much he develops when your 2nd option is Dennis Smith Jr
Dennis Smith Jr
"Just to name a few:  Oj Mayo ‚Äî ‚Äúthe next MJ,‚Äù Good ol‚Äô Jimmer (I still have faith), Dennis Smith Jr., Jabari ‚Äúno knees‚Äù Parker, Gary Harris (maybe this will be the year)"
Dennis smith jr
"Lmfao how are you downvoted? Payton Pritchard averaged 7.7 points a game (19 min) last year. If Payton's an NBA level scorer then Dennis Smith Jr. should be considered a scorer 7.3 pts (19 min). Also Draymond is a scorer at 7.0 per game. Delon Wright averaged 10.0 a game, he must be scorer too? TJ McConnell dropped 8.6 a game, he can score the basketball.  Yeah right, this sub man."
Not top 5 but I definitely though Dante Exum was going to reach a higher tier. Dennis Smith Jr too.
Dennis Smith Jr
rookie/sophomore dennis smith jr was a cheat code on 2k lol dude was like 99 speed/98 driving layup and could dunk
"Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr, Tyreke Evans, OJ Mayo, Adam Morrison, Emmanuel Mudiay, Jahlil Okafor, and more lol. There‚Äôs a lot of these guys üò≠"

But would the Mavericks like to sign Dennis Smith Jr?
"[Wojnarowski] Dennis Smith Jr. has agreed to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, but the Mavericks did not agree."
"Because hes not bad enough as these guys to be top 14, even if you think hes a bust do you think he belongs with guys like Josh Jackson or Dennis Smith Jr? Hes still a talented player capable of putting up 14/10 any given night."
Not before the ‚ÄúWE WANT FRANK‚Äù chant absolutely decimated the spirit of poor Dennis Smith Jr.  Is he going to even be in the league this upcoming season? Either of them?
"This thread is going to be mostly memes but I met most of the 2019-2020 Knicks team at a pre-season ticket holder event. Randle, RJ &amp; Mitch were super chill.

"Mavs fans are getting a heavy dose of this as well with all the new fans for Luka.  Shit, just a few years ago we thought Dennis Smith Jr. was going to lead us to the promise land if we got lucky and ended up with Mo Bamba.  But yet they bitch about not being able to land all the good deal ring chasers like the Lakers - GTFO...."

Imagine the Mavs with Dennis Smith Jr and Wendell Carter Jr and you have your answer.
Dennis Smith jr
&gt; They might just be better at picking guys they think will continue to make significant improvements.    Like even the players themselves say it's Coach Pop and The Spurs personal. Guys like Derrick White don't go from being a senior at colorado to developing and ultimately being better than guys like Markelle Fultz or Dennis Smith Jr. because the Spurs guessed it
"Wouldn‚Äôt you be afraid of him turning into like, a slightly better Dennis Smith Jr. for your team"
Dennis smith jr just had a great rookie year so they wouldn‚Äôt take another pg
Technically Dennis Smith Jr. was worst after Luka
"Yes, he is very athletic and talented. Has a ton of potential at PF or C, which is what makes it frustrating. Athleticism will only get guys so far, see Dennis Smith Jr. I bet he will mature and find his way to becoming a solid player, it will be a learning experience."
"It means that the prospect is ready to contribute as a rookie. Most rookies these days aren‚Äôt considered NBA ready because they still have have a big weakness or big weaknesses in their game that can create havoc for them early on. Many rookie these days only have one season of college basketball experience or never had college basketball experience. I don‚Äôt have the data in front of me but it feels like more highly touted prospects end up busting nowadays than ever before because they were not ready for the league. (Ex: Mudiay, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Josh Jackson, even though he was actually a contributor with the Pistons this past season)."
Lmao only reason this tournament doesn‚Äôt have NBA players is because it‚Äôs unknown  If Stanley Johnson and Dennis Smith Jr teamed up they could probably beat most of these teams 2v3
"If it makes you feel better, before Luka Doncic showed up at our doorsteps, Mavs fans were getting excited about Dennis Smith Jr. It gets worse before it gets better but maybe the Spurs will draft well the next few seasons and get back in the conversation for contention!"
"How does me saying Tatum was consensus 3-6 mean I have an agenda when it‚Äôs true lol.  [here is your link, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúconsensus mock draft‚Äù](https://www.nba.com/news/2017-consensus-mock-draft)  This consensus mock draft has Tatum #3, which falls into the category of consensus 3-6. Also in this consensus mock draft, Fultz goes #1.  Let‚Äôs look at [another consensus mock draft](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/2017-nba-consensus-mock-draft-final/)  In here it is the exact same. Markelle at #1, Tatum within the 3-6 range.  How about [1 more consensus mock](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2017/6/22/15852100/nba-draft-2017-final-consensus-mock-draft)  Here, once again we see Markelle go #1, but Tatum goes at number 4 behind Josh Jackson, which falls into the consensus 3-6 range.  These were the first 3 results when googling 2017 consensus mocks, completely randomly selected. In these we see a trend, Markelle at #1, Lonzo #2, and Jayson Tatum going in the 3-6 range.  That‚Äôs what consensus is. These are mocks by many draft experts who examine the NBA Draft for a living. You‚Äôre not gonna try and say they are ‚Äúrandom people‚Äù, right?  I don‚Äôt know what more you want. It is clear that Markelle was the consensus number 1 overall pick, while Tatum fell within the 3-6 range.  I don‚Äôt know what else to say. This argument is stupid. You are calling people who provide for their families by analyzing the draft ‚Äúrandom people on the internet‚Äù when they have platforms read by hundreds of thousands of NBA Fans who search ‚ÄúNBA Mock Draft‚Äù.   There were multiple mocks you can find that have Tatum behind Markelle, Lonzo, Jackson, Fox, and Dennis Smith Jr. that you can find. I do admit those are more rare, but they absolutely do exist.  I literally don‚Äôt know what else to say. The fact that this is even a discussion baffles me."
TJ warren is good. Dennis Smith JR is bad. Cody and Caleb Martin are okay.   All the other guys that made it didn't last more than a few games or a summer League or something.
Dennis Smith Jr
"Orlando Magic have been horrible at drafting for the last 7 seasons. They picked defensive specialist Mo Bamba 6th while SGA, MPJ, Sexton, Miles, Mikal, GTJ who are more fan favored offensive players were still on the board. They picked another defensive specialist the previous year at 6th with Mitchell, Bam, John Collins yet to be picked. Hell, picking Kuzma, Dennis Smith jr, Markkanen or Monk would've been more exciting for the fans. Dallas picked DSJ 9th who is basically out of the league now but they still sold the heck out of him in that one season of inefficient volume scoring and athletic showmanship. Going back further, they picked Aaron Gordon 4th who actually did generate some buzz and I'm sure there was no shortage of Orlando fans clamoring to see him succeed in the stands early in his career. The year before that, they picked Oladipo 2nd, who played like a prototypical volume scoring lottery pick and got the fans going but apparently he was also picked for his defense- WTF Orlando! Stop picking players for their defense in the top 6 when you don't have an offensive superstar."
"I've never seen a role player asked to do so much/keep switching positions mid-game multiple times just to cater to LeBron-AD's on &amp; off time, whether Pope is playing well, whatever the fuck they wanted to do with Dennis/Drummond/Trez  Dude might go from 2nd option when the big 2 are resting to non-existent the next quarter lol   He was solid in his defined role last season as a defense-slasher guy who occasionally gets more touches when AD sits + Bron is resting on the floor focusing on facilitating. Quick for his size and had much better footwork on both sides last season. Turnover prone with the JR-Smith IQ plays every now and then but it's not like he has to carry the offense"
Josh Smith Corey Brewer JR Smith Danual House Jr Ron Artest Dennis Rodman Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Nick Young Alex Caruso
For me Dennis Smith Jr lol
"&gt; I don't think Billups was the right move  Just curious why you believe this? I think his experience with the Clippers and T-Lue will do him a world of good.   &gt; With Kanter and Melo gone too, I'm hoping for a 4th straight year of a top 5 offense  I kind of expect the Blazers to be #2 in offense again and don't see why they wouldn't be. I really like the addition of Dennis Smith Jr., think it's possible he has a similar impact to what Cam Payne did for Phoenix last year.   Nance and Zeller are significant upgrades over Melo and Kanter, which will massively improve the defense.   I really think Portland has a chance to replicate the similar formula the Jazz/Suns used to be an elite team last year in the regular season, two shot creating guards, a 5 that can anchor a defense and good role player wings. Slight difference is each of those teams has an extra wing with them being able to call on Cam Johnson/Ingles off the bench.   I would bet on Portland being a Top 4-5 team in the West this year, with the potential for as high as 3 if things go right. I also expect you guys to come out of the gate on fire and with urgency."
" Marquese Chriss, Quinn Cook, Patrick Patterson, Dennis Smith Jr.  Not a bad group to pick the 15th guy off the bench."
"Dennis Smith Jr had to catch a few strays smh. My mans got one of the meanest mixtapes of all time still , too bad he wasnt good professionally."
"""John Wall is an all nba level PG"" he was that in 2017 when he was in his athletic prime, since then he missed two years, looked decent at times last year, but also looked like Dennis Smith Jr. half the season."
I think it‚Äôs too late he‚Äôs in the Dennis smith jr situation but worse either g league or goes to another team if he‚Äôs lucky
"That was a very nice write up. You've convinced me!      A potentially underrated signing: Dennis Smith Jr... Very good defensive hustle and super athletic. And that's all you need from a back up PG. Together with the other solid signings, they can be a very decent bench...they may not out score you, but defensively they won't let a lead drop, which is huge given their starters play so well together. Biggest stat to me is how well the starters played with +10 in possession per 100, including playoffs! Depending on how Chauncey coaches, along with solid starter play, and if the bench can be solid/decent, then you could see a surprise top team in the west."
Dennis Smith Jr
Let's just give Dennis Smith Jr a summer's worth of tape.  He'll be a more athletic Jason Kidd in no time.
Hilarious that Dennis smith Jr and Frank ntilikina have both played for the Mavericks and Knicks after being back to back picks
Mixed with Dennis Smith jr
Bro YES. My dirty unpopular secret opinion is that Ja is 2021 version of Dennis Smith Jr
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
Dennis Smith Jr- I thought that he was going to be Steve Francis 2.0   Mario Hezonja- I felt that he would be a Luka type player with crazy athleticism.
I was super high on Dennis smith Jr turns out all he could do was jump high
Frank Ntilikina / Dennis Smith Jr / Kevin Knox / Sekou Doumbouya / Harry Giles
"Exactly, or Dennis Smith jr. Or Payton. I'm a Ntilikina fan so the last few years was hard to watch."
You sure you don‚Äôt mean Dennis Smith Jr.?
noted lock-down defender Dennis Smith Jr.
Mitchell Robinson Dennis Smith Jr Knox and like 2 first round picks would of been the starting point.
"I‚Äôm not trying to argue or anything but you didn‚Äôt reply to my other comment and I‚Äôm genuinely down to see your side on this - but if you agree that positions are fluid then how can you flat out say Luka is *not* a point guard? When he starts alongside DFS, Josh Richardson, Kleber and Porzingis, I don‚Äôt see how Luka cannot be a point guard in this lineup.  You can‚Äôt just box someone into one position, that‚Äôs why people are labelled as multi-positional. It always depends on who you are playing with on the court. If Luka played the majority of his minutes with another point guard (such as Brunson or Dennis Smith Jr early in his career), then sure he‚Äôs not the point guard in that case."
"Positions are fluid, so he‚Äôs both. But Luka literally started at point guard this year, because Josh Richardson, Hardaway Jr, DFS are definitely not point guards. Early in his career when he started with Dennis Smith Jr., or games when Brunson starts, Luka is a point forward, not the point guard.  People bring up LeBron being a point guard but he‚Äôs started with other actual point guards for most of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). In the Lakers year where Danny Green &amp; Avery Bradley/KCP would start, then yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Either than that he‚Äôs largely been a point forward."
The Dennis Smith Jr disrespect smh
"Yeah it was rough but there was never anyone saying the lakers should have picked smith over lonzo. Dennis smith jr was always compared against ntilikina, cause he was drafted right before him"
"[Woj] Free agent guard Dennis Smith Jr., has signed a deal to attend training camp with the Portland Trail Blazers, sources tell ESPN. Smith played 23 games between Detroit and New York last season."
Dennis Smith Jr for sure. He's turned into a positive defender and he still has his outlier athleticism and some offensive skills. There's 0 hope of Frank being anything more than a huge negative on offense at this point.
Trade him for Dennis Smith Jr. straight up.
Dennis Smith Jr
"Started working on a All-Smith Team..Rather than try to make it good, I stopped here because it made me happy:   * JR Smith * Josh Smith * Dennis Smith Jr  Least efficient or self-aware team in NBA history."
Dennis Smith Jr   Ja Morant   Russell Westbrook
"Dennis Smith JR (Dallas year), Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook"
"Trey Burke, Hardaway Jr, Marcus Morris, Melo, Porzingis  For Pg the options are: Burke, Ntilikina, Dennis Smith, elfrid Payton, mudiay (?)"
"No, being a high draft pick doesn‚Äôt automatically get you a 2nd contract. But you‚Äôre out of your mind if you don‚Äôt think those players get more leeway to fail or rewarded a bit more when they show flashes of being a good player because of their ‚Äúpotential‚Äù. This all ties back to Lonzo: As soon as he had a good shooting season and was showing he could improve, he got a big contract. You think an undrafted guy gets that that same grace period? A 2nd rounder? Hell, , Dennis Smith Jr, Emanuel Mudiay, and Mario Hezonja got multiple teams to take fliers on them because they were lottery picks and teams just wanna see if maybe they‚Äôll find a diamond in the rough."
"Dennis Smith jr. was actually decent on the defensive end for the Pistons last season, tbh I prefer him over Cory Joseph, but it is what it is. He deserves another go with another team."
"Mitchell Robinson, although I think he will be a star in this league soon enough. Made serious strides last season on offense and defense. If he can stay healthy for a whole or most of the season he'll be right up there in DPOY conversation, also I think for what it's worth he's the best lob threat in the game. Not only is he 7 foot but he jumps like he's Dennis Smith Jr and his catch radius is insane, never seen an ability like his to block so many jumpshots on the perimeter"
Sounds like Dennis Smith jr.   He hasn‚Äôt gotten another contract yet either
"Because of his play style, injuries have been common and it will only get worse as his body ages.    A healthy Kyrie is amazing to watch. The way he contorts his body, his change of direction, his ability to control his speed, the twists and turns, starts and stops are incredible. He's the best ball handler and finisher.. maybe of all time when healthy.  But all of those exciting moves come at a price.  Those joints, ligaments and muscles get worn and that's why he's hurt so much.   It really is a trade off.  Do you play the more conservative game and save your body? Or do you go all out, live fast, die young, and be mesmerizing?  If Kyrie played more conservatively, would Nike have given him his own shoe? Would we be talking about him as much?    I always say to young guys under 6-4 who LOVE to play above the rim - learn to shoot, save your knees.  Play like Lillard, not like Dennis Smith Jr. Your knees are usually one of the first things to go when you get old and play a sport like basketball."
"Not a lot of options for the Mavs since we haven‚Äôt had much roster turnover recently.   I‚Äôd have to say Seth is the more widely popular pick, while Dennis Smith jr. fans are fewer but have a lot more love for him"
"‚ÄúDennis Smith Jr. is the next Westbrook‚Äù ‚Äî to be fair, both have played for three different teams in the last three years /s"
I know he's trash but Dennis Smith Jr too
Ja Morant will be Dennis Smith Jr
"Oh, big fucking whoop, even an idiot like DSJ can realize he needs to play and play well in order to get moved. He still [held out for like 2 weeks](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2019/1/17/18187216/dennis-smith-jr-considers-himself-done-with-mavericks-trade-rumors) before that, because he's an entitled little douche.   &gt; FOH with this ‚Äúrefusing to train‚Äù pearl clutching  Here's literal quote from the article  &gt; ... confirmed what many of us have suspected since **Smith [...] missed practice** Tuesday afternoon  You people and your imaginary excuses for these dickheads, are honestly mind-boggling.  cc /u/Somenakedguy"
"One of the ESPN announcers said the same thing you did, so I don't blame you. That was the year Dallas drafted Dennis Smith Jr too. DSJ was supposed to start next to Curry."
"You‚Äôre completely talking out your ass, just like you have been all over this thread.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2815891-nba-trade-rumors-dennis-smith-jr-didnt-request-mavericks-move-open-to-idea?share=other  DSJ literally had a triple double the day before he got traded lol. FOH with this ‚Äúrefusing to train‚Äù pearl clutching."
Lol the Mavs traded DSJ because he was basically their best trade piece in the KP move. No one was held hostage by Dennis Smith Jr lmao
Dennis Smith Jr.
Dennis Smith Jr is the perfect reserve guard. so patient with the rock.
Dennis Smith jr.‚Äôs high school mixtape. A glimpse of what it would look like if God played basketball
Can't believe they snubbed Dennis Smith Jr.
Lol. I think it depends. Dennis smith jr and Luka started right away. But top picks are different from out of lottery picks.   Truth is. This points to a front office who didn't know how to draft too well and find value outside of lottery positions.
Luka started since the first game....  Also started Dennis Smith Jr. from the absolute beginning ....
I‚Äôd much rather have Tim Hardaway and KP even with the huge contract over *checks notes* Dennis Smith Jr. and two late first round picks.
"And the anti-Dejuan Blair, Dennis Smith Jr."
* Hawks reach the finals after embarrassing the Bucks in the ecf and people start to wonder if Trae &gt; Giannis is a good take. * Kyrie doesn't end up getting the vaccine but is able to rejoin the Brooklyn nets after local mandate changes eases up after pushback from local minority citizens in New York * Knicks lose in the playoffs and fail to make the play-in * Blazers and Mavs are a top 4 seed. Luka gets his first mvp primarily due to team success and popularity * Trae Young finishes top 3 in mvp voting and selected 1st team all-nba * Dennis Smith Jr. revitalizes his career with the Blazers (Similar to Melo) and is seen as an above average point guard. * Kings make the play-in and knock out the Lakers from playoff contention

"Which is weird. He probably could play anywhere 1-4, but he just hasn't had real minutes at any position other than PG since Dennis Smith Jr was traded."
"Yeah to be honest ive met quite a few NBA players, and most of the time they dont like interaction (which is understandable) with regular people. With how some act  it might even rub people wrong way, but hey athletes are on an entirely different mindset and some dont really want to deal with the constant interviews and rumors that come with being a famous athlete. Players will most likely defend other players especially if they are on the same team.  Personally i've seen enough to realize players dont give a damn about regular people considering they've been praised from early teenage years to the pros. Life is a bit easier for them and they dont have to abide by the same rules of life that we all have to.  That being said I remember the nicest ones ive met were GPII and Dennis Smith Jr., both we're somewhat normal and very easy going people which was refreshing."
I was convinced that Dennis Smith Jr was going to be a superstar
"Interesting that this model confirms my prior that I don't think the Lakers and Warriors are nearly as good as Vegas thinks they are and that it's foolish to have them as the 2 Vegas favorites to make the Finals.   I've said all along that Phoenix and Utah are co-favorites to win the West from an odds perspective due to reliability in regular season and health, but that Denver has the highest ceiling and if they're healthy, they should make the Finals. I would actually say the Clippers have the highest ceiling when fully healthy, but I think it's fairly safe to assume that Kawhi won't play this season.   Also, I've been big on the Blazers in this season and it's funny how eerily similar they could be to last year's Suns.   Last year's Suns going into the season: 1604 Team Rating, 7% Make Finals, 3% Win Finals  This year's Blazers going into the season: 1602 Team Rating, 7% Make Finals, 3% Win Finals  I think Billups is going to make a big difference for the Blazers, and if they can have Phoenix-like good health, then they stand a good chance of being a great regular season team because their Top 6 is so good. Interesting that their team page doesn't even have Dennis Smith Jr. listed on the roster, I think he could very well be this year's Cam Payne, former lottery pick that comes out of nowhere to be a very good 3rd guard on a good team."
Who in the nba that‚Äôs small shoots or dribbles worst? They are only in the league because their ‚Äúskill‚Äù in off the charts. Even Dennis smith jr probably has more ‚Äúskill‚Äù than most all time greats. Please don‚Äôt respond with shooting percentages in game. I‚Äôm talking practice wide open.
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
"Obviously they had the best year since Melo was there, but I still don‚Äôt think the Knicks are in a great shape.   I look at their roster and just don‚Äôt see what their future is. I rate RJ Barrett more than anyone, I pretty much locked him as an all star from day one. While no doubt he will improve (as being so young as a slasher is almost impossible, how can he bash against teal me) just from general strength and his body being more mature, I still thought he would‚Äôve showed a bit more than he has. Thibs just seems to hate him. So while I expect improvement, he still needs to take that next leap.   Apart from RJ, who/what do they have? Obi Toppin? Quickley? Not much of a future there (even though Quickley had some nice moments last year) from what we have seen.  Randle had his best season, but does he keep it up or does he go back to his selfish ways if the knicks get off to a bad start? The rest of the roster is just literally role players.  They traded their best player in a deal they couldn‚Äôt of done any worse on. Dennis Smith Jr is currently playing for the blazers and had maybe 5 good games at the Knicks and they still aren‚Äôt a free agent destination.  So while it was absolutely awesome to see such an underdog team in a big market do well for the first time in forever, I just don‚Äôt see much brightness in their future right now. Things can change and I hope they do. Just not sold."
"I've met a few before they were NBA players or after they had retired. Never met a current NBA player.  I met Kyrie when he came to my highschool while he was at Duke. Honestly don't know why he was there. He wasn't insane yet at this point. He was chill.  I met Dennis Smith JR, TJ Warren, Lorenzo brown (in and out the league), and Omer Yurtseven, Caleb and Cody Martin all at NC State when I was a student there. All were chill. Dennis Smith thought he was god on campus though lmao.   I met Sidney Lowe at a basketball camp NC State held when he was the coach when I was a kid. All I remember is he had monster size hands.   I think that's everyone."
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"

Dennis Smith Jr.  Slangin' wood...
People thought Dennis Smith Jr. was gonna be Russell Westbrook for seemingly no reason
"Listen golden state took the front facing approach and I love it. But their fedora attempt likely won‚Äôt work. I promise it‚Äôs a whole lot easier to just pay uncle Dennis and give up the keys to the old retired private jet you don‚Äôt use lol. If the other GMs catch on the NBA is gonna be the Basketball Husbands soon Lmfaooo. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm here for it 100%! It‚Äôs already the most hilariously dramatic sports association in the world. I didn‚Äôt honestly think it would get better but Jerry West was a great intro to this concept if you‚Äôve been paying attention. That mother fucka could give a sing fuck and im here for it! I‚Äôm still waiting for the next McGee, Stephenson, JR Smith type characters to come back into the league‚Ä¶. I miss the insane dynamic with the media and especially this sub those legends had! Man classic times. If we get another Way Off P year I might shed a thug tear. That whole story was pure gold from start to finish‚Ä¶. Somebody please renew game of zones!!!! My god‚Ä¶"
Just because he‚Äôs young doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs good. Dennis Smith Jr looked like a future all star his rookie season. Same with MCW and Tyreke Evans. THT hasn‚Äôt started a game and wasn‚Äôt in the depth chart last year in the playoffs even though Schroeder was struggling.
"That's an interesting thought experiment.  Portland has Anfernee Simons (Slam Dunk winner), Dennis Smith Jr (contestant), Larry Nance Jr (contestant), Ben MacLemore (contestant), and Dame Lillard (contestant). Though I don't think MacLemore and DSJ are guaranteed to make the team.  Still, a surprisingly large collection of good dunkers (in their primes)."
And Dennis Smith Jr!
Kinda like that game where Dennis Smith JR has a triple double against us and then we traded for him right after that
"It gets worse with Dallas. Every time I read DFS I keep thinking ""Dennis Fucking Smith"" and get surprised that Dennis Smith Jr came back."
"It gets worse with Dallas. Every time I read DFS I keep thinking ""Dennis Fucking Smith"" and get surprised that Dennis Smith Jr came back."
"If you agree elaborate on your thoughts. What makes him worse than someone like Jarrett Culver, Dennis Smith Jr., or Elfrid Payton on offense? Be specific.   Alvin Robertson, Bruce Bowen, Andre Roberson, Tony Allen - all of these guys were TERRIBLE on offense, yet still played plenty of minutes because of their all league defense. You would think that the worst defensive team in the league could find a consistent spot in the rotation for an all league level defender, even if it was just 20 minutes a night.  I‚Äôm also still waiting for someone to actually SPEAK to his game. What does he do in particular on defense that makes him so good? What do you like about his on ball defense? His off ball defense? How does he handle switches? What does he do defensively in transition that stands out?   What in particular about his offense not only makes him bad, but the ‚Äúworst offensive guard in the league‚Äù? It‚Äôs all fun and games until you ask people to actually provide descriptions of the players they want to make blanket statements about."
For Mavs:  * 2016: AJ Hammon -&gt; Jake Layman (46 -&gt; 47) * 2017: Dennis Smith Jr. -&gt; Zach Collins (9 -&gt; 10) * 2018: Trae Young -&gt; Mo Bamba (5 -&gt; 6) * 2019: Deividas Sirvydis -&gt; Daniel Gafford (37 -&gt; 38) * 2020: Josh Green -&gt; Saddiq Bey (18 -&gt; 19)
Jimmer and Dennis Smith Jr.  Don't ask for my advice about rookies ever
Dennis Smith Jr was seen as a promising player back then and everyone thought that the Knicks were fleeced in that trade.
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
The difference in how Donovan Mitchell's and Dennis Smith Jr.'s career have gone is wild
fuck that he carried the load for that team last season until he broke down so bad he could barely participate in the playoffs and even still he was giving it his all until the end. and that was after a career as an ironman. then ~20 games into the next season they turn on him for slumping. its ridiculous and entitled and i know for damn sure knicks fans would killed for behaving like that. in fact we already have been and that was just for booing dennis smith jr.
I'm saying nothing relatively easy requires Vince's athleticism but like...you gotta at least be Dennis Smith Jr to pull that off mid-game lol
Shabazz Napier got praise from Lebron. I remember him saying some pretty good stuff about Dennis Smith Jr as well
Time to bring back Dennis Smith Jr.
"Let‚Äôs see  DJ- sucked and walked for nothing   Wes- was waived   Dennis Smith Jr- flipped for Derrick Rose. While this did have a good outcome, dennis‚Äôs value was dirt cheap. A couple of second rounders and/or Knox could‚Äôve done the same thing   2021 1st- traded again for a future protected pick  2023 1st- hasn‚Äôt conveyed   The only aspect of the trade you‚Äôre reaping the rewards from is Rose who could‚Äôve been acquired regardless of the trade"
"From what I know definitely not, for a few reasons:  - Pistons organization views Jerami Grant as a centrepiece - rejected three first round picks last deadline  - Pistons also view Saddiq Bey as a centrepiece, calling him part of the ‚ÄúCore 4‚Äù  - Pistons can‚Äôt trade any firsts as its currently owed to OKC  - Theyre trying to tank this year, and they‚Äôre angling to free up cap space for 2023/2024 off-seasons  - Organization keeps speaking about ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù and how talent doesn‚Äôt matter if their character isn‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for   - Theyre building around Cade Cunningham as the franchise star   But I‚Äôll say, Weaver hasn‚Äôt been afraid to make moves (traded literally everyone on the roster, Killian‚Äôs the longest tenured Piston) and he loves taking chances on highly drafted players that need fresh starts (Okafor, Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, Dennis Smith Jr, rumors of Bagley).   He also makes calls to every team about everything so even if this ‚Äúinterest‚Äù was true he was prolly doing due diligence."
Yo is GP2 better than Dennis Smith Jr?
So did Marvin Bagley. So did Dennis Smith jr.
"I get that Dwight should have been on there because of career accomplishment (All NBA's, All Stars, DPOY..etc), but what's always been tough for me, is that if he had played 10-15 years earlier, he would never have made an All NBA, never won a DPOY, and only made an all star team due to injury.  And that's not like a 50 year gap - Dennis Smith Jr. would be on it if he played against Cousy!!! It's basically one generation earlier. Hell, old fat Shaq gave it to Dwight.  But he would have been behind Ewing, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, behind Mutombo defensively. Ric Smits would have been dumping jumpers in his face...  He just found a historical soft spot and reaped the benefits."
"For what lol, Dennis Smith Jr?"
"Nah.   The benefit of that is to maximize shooting/ offence, but Dennis smith jr sucks. Maybe with powell, but then again most of their issues are at the defensive end so probably not"

"Yeah because the Knicks have definitely been known to take big talents from small teams the last 10 years‚Ä¶ like Bargnani, Dennis Smith Jr and‚Ä¶. Enes Kanter??? The last big trade we had was Melo over 10 years ago."
"For real tho. Weaver‚Äôs acquired Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Trey Lyles, now Bagley - give me ALL the busts"
I thought Dennis Smith Jr. would become Dame light.
"Search threads on Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson and Frank Ntkilina"
"RJ is the far better player but that is because his strengths in terms of skills right now far out way Cam‚Äôs . Talent in my mind is basically what you can‚Äôt teach, Cam is a more fluid athlete, more coordinated, has more natural instinct . He just can‚Äôt really bring it together or do one thing well enough to be a great.   Some of the most talented players in the NBA aren‚Äôt that good. People are confusing talent with overall ability and making it seem like I am saying he is as good as RJ.   Talent is just natural ability such as athleticism, coordination, instincts , not your skill level.   Dennis Smith Jr. - talented - shit player  Andrew Wiggins - talented - not as good as a lot of players far less talented.  Jason ‚Äúwhite Chocolate‚Äùwilliams -talented-not that good.   Kwame Brown"
Shabazz would be on the squad but Dennis Smith Jr would be his franchise player.
Trading Dennis Smith Jr for Drose literally brought back the Knicks to relevancy
Dennis Smith Jr. and a second round pick
The Knicks got Derrick Rose for fucking Dennis Smith Jr lol
Dennis Smith jr.
"As a Knicks fan, I remember the backlash we faced over booing Dennis Smith Jr. with many people dubbing us the worst NBA fan base. It‚Äôs not that we hate DSJ or anyone on our team, it‚Äôs that we boo when players aren‚Äôt playing with any effort. I remember us booing him after he kept taking pull-up 3‚Äôs and midrange shots for 3-4 possessions in a row early into the shot clock, missing them all. He was just playing with no sense or consideration for winning or involving other teammates, so Knicks fans justifiably got upset.   Philly Boston and NYC have very passionate fans who aren‚Äôt afraid of letting the teams know about their lack of effort in playing in a winning way, so it‚Äôs kind-of common for booing to take place."
"I always think that you need to evaluate a pick relative to the players who could have been picked in that spot. There's always going to be someone better taken way deeper in the draft, but the point is usually that NOBODY saw that guy coming.  Most of the time teams are, in practice, choosing between 3-5 players. So the question is, was the guy taken better than the next 3-5 guys taken?  So with Kendall Marshall, both John Henson and Mo Harkless had better careers, and they were the next two picks. That makes it a clear bad pick. (IN fact, four of the next five picks had better careers. Oof.)  On the other hand, Alex Len - you look at the next few picks, and they're not clearly better than Alex Len by a large margin until you get to CJ McColumn. So you say he wasn't worthy of the #5 pick but that's actually fairly typical return for a #5 pick: solid rotation guy, nothing special. So that's not a bad pick.   TJ Warren went two picks ahead of Nurkic, but was better than the other guys around there. Solid pick.  Devin Booker was picked ahead of a bunch of other decent players, which makes that pick look ever better. Lots of plausible picks and they got the best one!  Dragan Bender, OTOH, is an awful pick. The guys taken after him (Dunn, Hield, Murray, Chriss, Poetl) are all better.   And Josh Jackson is more borderline than I think you're giving them credit for. D'Aaron Fox, Johnathan Issac, Lauri Markinnen, Frank Nkitolina, Dennis Smith, Jr? Josh is neither the best nor the worst of those players. Going to the G-league as a rookie isn't a bit deal for a young guy. He look to have the makings of a serviceable backup big.  2018 obviously they should have taken Luka.   2019 since they must have drafted for the trade, hard to evaluate based on thee quality of the player.   And with Smith they could have had Haliburton ... and now they declined his option? Wow. Yeah. Huge mistake.  So there are a couple of howlers there, but also some of those picks aren't as bad as they look."
Not really. He said they should have drafted Dennis Smith Jr.
He said this almost verbatim about Dennis Smith Jr
