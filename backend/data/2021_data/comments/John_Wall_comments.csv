"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Victor Oladipo"
John Wall  Oladipo  Tate  Tucker  Wood  Eric Gordon  House  Nwaba  Mclemore  Cousins  Sterling brown  Mason jones  Kenyon martin jr  Dante exum  Kevin Porter Jr
This is a Fred Vanvleet thread not a John Wall thread
John Wall and beal too.

"I guess I'm in between. I think they're mostly overrating John Wall — I think Wood, Gordon and Dipo have been a bit more impactful (on the floor - Wall seems to be killing it as a locker room presence).  But I mean...good teams beat bad teams and that's what the Rockets are doing. Interesting to see how the rest of their season goes."
Why is Beal talking? Only times he made the playoffs he was carried by John Wall man lol
"people said the same thing about KD. people said the same thing about John Wall.  you are delusional if you think a fucking 34 year old *GLEN DAVIS* is better than Klay Thompson, even if he's at 50%."
He's like 1st contract John Wall minus the unnecessary weight gain and subsequent leg injuries.
"As a Russ stan, I think Rockets are overhyping the John Wall impact on the floor. However, they do seem to have a bunch of really locked in guys and a better culture. So congrats to them.  I said the trade would go well for both teams - Wizards still have time and Rockets are looking like a late seed/play-in team. Good for them and awesome for Boogie and Wall and Wood with these seasons."
*Harden had John Wall and Christian Wood
"He ""feuded"" with WB as much as John Wall and Beal ""feuded."" They literally hired the same agent to get out of Houston together. Bringing up Howard is a meme and CP3 was fine until he got hurt started and playing like shit.  The organization cheaped out on his title window and then treated his coach and GM like shit when they moved on from them. They didn't even call MDA to let him know they weren't renewing.  Please stop talking about this if your only source of information is Max Kellerman."
"John Wall: ""we all enjoy playing with each other. Just look at our team now, compared to the beginning of the season. We're all cheering for each other. Thats all that matters""  &amp;#x200B;  u/DeerOnTheRocks \- we need a John Wall v Harden Shade meme !"
"Woah Ken, I never said I did it. Here’s a story; I sat next to this 70 something yr old white dude a few years ago at a Hawks game. He was a cool dude, apparently he was a long time regular. Had a special jacket gifted to him from the franchise with a bunch of badges &amp; autographs on it from over the years, Al Horford knew him by first name. He was talkin’ shit to John Wall cuz he flopped. He said something along the lines “stop fuckin floppin John!” John made eye contact with him and followed with a huge grin. Just saying, some NBA players think they’re better than the fans and have a shit attitude, kinda like you."
"John Wall, Christian Wood, Oladipo, the ghost of Boogie..... this doesn't surprise me"
part of me wants to get high on the schedenfraude of the downfall of the brooklyn nets. yes THIS IS WHAT YOU GET!! YOU ALL OFFENSE NO DEFENSE HEADLINE HOGGING PRIMA DONNAS! team of iso players! what a victory for team basketball! a victory for the island of misfit toys that is houston! what a nice story about the resurrection of john wall and demarcus cousins.  but i know this is the empire strikes back and brooklyn must prevail. i dunno i just get that feeling. that the sheer weight of talent will somehow prevail.  well better them than the lakers i guess.
"Let’s not do this. People were on here making jokes about John Wall being a tank commander, no one thought they’d be this decent and that’s credit to the players and the coach. Harden made the right call, Rockets look good now but he made the right basketball decision to leave, we’ll see how well it pans out."
"Somehow, we lost our GM, our coach, our second best player, and then our franchise superstar, and I’m having the most fun I’ve had watching the Rockets in 3 years.   Wall - What a fucking guy. Natural leader, makes no excuses, uses every chance he gets to gas his team up and stand up for them. I would die for John Wall.  Wood - Rockets fans knew. We knew last year at the trade deadline that C Wood was gonna be a killer. When we didn’t get him, I thought we’d really never sign him. Now he’s putting up [Giannis numbers](https://i.imgur.com/J5avEqq.jpg).  Oladipo - I was worried he didn’t wanna be here, and maybe he still doesn’t. But I can’t fucking tell. And he was talking about how much fun he’s having with this team in the postgame interview.   This whole team, top to bottom, is so fucking awesome. I loved James Harden, but I’m having fun."
"Did you ever hear the tragedy of James Harden The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Nets would tell you. It’s a Rockets legend. James Harden was an MVP, so powerful and so wise he could use the ISO to influence teammates to give up on life… He had such a thirst for dribbling that he could even keep Russell Westbrook from contributing. The dark side of the ISO is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught John Wall everything he knew, then Wall killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could give others the keys to a title, but not himself."
"The closest I’ve sat was the sixth row behind the Wizards bench at a Warriors game in 2013. Early in the game, Steph had a fast break layup and John Wall blocked the shit out of it from nowhere. Right then and there, I knew I was watching the absolute highest tier of basketball I could possibly watch. People who say the game is soft today, if you could watch these guys play up close, you wouldn’t say that.   And then having the opportunity to be sitting literally on the court floor. Tbh, I would probably buy a spare iPhone, two or three chargers, and record the whole damn game."
"Wood over Capela, but Wall over Paul? No thanks. I love the way John Wall has been balling out for Houston, but Chris Paul was, and still is a better, smarter player."

Bradley beal john wall christian wood luka . new superteam
Dude I was hating on Westbrook's play all playoffs when he was on my team. I was calling for him to please be traded. I don't just think with my fandom. John Wall is just better.
I would die for John Wall
"John Wall is 4-4 at half time for us  Westbrook never even hit over 4 3s for us.  Wall is also a better catch and shoot 3 point shooter by FAR.  At this point of their careers, Wall is a better shooter from 3"
John Wall the sniper
Westbrook last year was definitely better than John Wall so far
When did John Wall learn to shoot 3’s off the dribble??? Insane!!
Sharpshooter John Wall
john wall is so good
"I noticed a lot of these issues too, and as a long time Wizards fan I don’t remember him being this bad any season prior. He just looks done with the team and unless we start winning I think he is traded at the end of the season. Just watching Russel take everything, I think part of Beals issues stems from that Wall and Westbrook trade. I definitely think he would rather have Wall, Westbrook is the most ball dominant player Wizards have ever had, and we had John Wall last season.  Bradley is insane scorer but he needs to pick it up as a team player, he gets paid millions, he better play hard everywhere no matter what."
John Wall?
Suddenly Westbrook is close to surpassing John Walls season stats after last nights huge game. Everyone overreacted Westbrook isn’t perfect but he ain’t washed. He’s better than John Wall that’s for sure.
"He uses his athleticism to set up his passing, if he's not able to break the defense down and pressure the rim for drive and kicks he's not going to be effective.  I think your comment applies perfectly for when John Wall starts to age tho"
Funny enough I think the game against Wall helped spark him up.  He played well against Atlanta and now Brooklyn. God damn I love John Wall ❤️
This isn’t the first game he’s played since his bickering with John wall though
John Wall really got into his head
Can Wizards fans stop being toxic dummies who love John Wall more than their own team now please?
John Wall
Did you return to sports and tear it or was it an accident outside of play like John Wall?
"Now you're simply underplaying Kyrie. Advanced stats and basic stats have painted him as a top 15 player for a while, and your statement that only casuals would agree with is false. What 15 players were clearly better than Kyrie in 2017-2018? Guys like PG, Dame, at that time it was extremely debatable Kyrie Vs Dame. You have to remember how bad Dame choked in the playoffs. Embiid or Jokic weren't really considered a top 10 player yet either, nor Jimmy Butler, or Tatum, guys that are considered top 15 today.   Now obviously there are some players, like Chris Paul, Westbrook, John Wall, who were considered much better then than now, but your just flat out wrong to say that no one would think Kyrie was a top 15 player back in those days."
"Wizards would be   PG: John Wall  SG: Agent Zero  SF: Gus Johnson  PF: Elvin Hayes  C: Wes Unseld    so John Wall is the only active player, but he isn’t a wizard anymore"
"I’m sure the pressure of Lavar also kind of fucked with him. He seems more timid than Lamelo and had John Wall and other noteable players gunning for him as a rookie all season. Lamelo kind of came in with no outside pressure, no fans, nor Lavar. Who knows what would’ve happened had they switched roles"
"Let's be real, KD's 18 months long recocery was a result of NBA's being postponed for several months due to Coronavirus. That's the exception, not the rule. KD would've started the season much earlier if it wasn't for the pandemic. Same goes for John Wall btw."

"I had included the 2018-2019 season as well where he played 67 games above..  In the 2017-2018 season, he shot 61.6 % on 4.7 attempts. Holiday shot 64.4 % on 5.3 attempts. Oladipo shot 66.8 % on 5.1 attempts. Donovan Mitchell shot 61.7 % on 5.0 attempts. John Wall shot 61.5 % on 5.5 attempts. Harden shot 62.4 % on 62.4 attempts."
So glad we got John wall
They didn't say anything about it specifically but every shot we took went in. John Wall stepback? Wood catch and shoot? Oladipo corner? All down the hatch in the 2nd
"Yeah he wasn’t a shooter coming out and he continues to not be a shooter. Which severely lowers his ceiling, obviously. I ask this because to me he was never one of those “sky is the limit” guys. He was a guy with an insane amount of skill coming out, it translated immediately and he’ll probably max out at being a better version of what he is now. That includes lowering turnovers and applying his athleticism to be a plus defender.   Not to portray this as a negative. If John wall remained healthy he would be on track to the hall due to all nba selections"
I did not realize it was klay commentating until i connected the dots about them talking abt kd and john wall coming back from injuries and him rehabbing and getting back out there.
"Well lets count the west.   Booker,  Doncic  PG13,  Mitchell,   Jamal Murray  Dame  McCollum  Steph   John wall  SGA  Each one of these players have a right to be in the All Star.  If you ask me these players are in front of CP3 (not in any order)  1) Doncic  2) Lillard  3) Curry   4) Mitchell  5) Booker  6) SGA  7) PG13"
I have and will always love John “dunk like a lefty” Wall and his sexy ass game
I love John Wall with all my heart and sole. Thank you Wizards fans
John Wall will walk the ball out of court and all 3 refs will miss it
"bro you think  john wall   james harden (la gonna trap him at half court again)  House  PJ  Wood  Cousins  Gordon  is going to beat  LBJ, AD, Schroeder, Harrell, Gasol, Caruso, Kuzma, KCP, THT? all they gotta do is double up Harden and the team will crumble like 2019. At least in BKN they can’t defend all 3 stars"
I may be dead inside but I will always love John Wall
That John Wall guy is pretty good at basketball.
"Imagine not taking 5 minutes of your day to vote for Christian Wood, John Wall, and Victor Oladipo to be NBA All-Stars in 2021 lmao couldn't be me."
"[heres that yip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lkf15ETxoU)  i feel kinda bad for russ. the way the ref throws him the ball like ""come on, this is a job"".. from watching the nets, every time KD has a problem with a call, the ref's hear him out. a privilege only those who are respected get.  russ must have felt like he lost an older brother when KD left okc's organization. and russ must have felt that he needed to show the press and people that he wasn't upset by the him leaving, and that he had to show strength. unfortunately, i think this resonated with him thruout his career. strength became ignorance.   to see an MVP argue with john wall, or rajon rondo.... *pshh, whatever...*  it makes you wish more and more that he would just get on a winning team and try to win one instead of trying to constantly prove a point with his entire nba career."
Why’s it shitty for John wall? Seems like he’s doing just fine in Houston.
"Top 10 !?! Right now ? Uh lets see Curry, Dame, kyrie , cp3, john wall , ben simmons , trae young , ja morant, deaaron fox , kemba, jamal murray are all better rn"
He’s not the most hyped prospect ever obviously but the hype for John Wall was pretty crazy coming out of high school. Arguably got the best high school mixtape of all time alongside Aquille Carr and Austin Rivers
"Blake did not “mastered” a ton of other skills. But you can believe that. His shooting improve, sure. But he’s nowhere near as threatening as he was in his prime due to his athleticism.  John Wall has never been in the top ten point guard category in his entire career. But because he can “assist” he’s now great?  Dwight was 3x DPOY, declined heavily in his offensive prowess because he refused to adapt to the game as it evolved and quickly found himself putting on New Jersey’s every year to the point he became a bench player. I’m not denying he’s a solid defensive piece. But for what he was, a super star, to what he is now it’s a day and night difference.  I’m not saying any of these players are shit. I’m saying that these players are where they are, AND INJURY PRONE, because their unlimited abuse to their own bodies. Which is my initial statement; athletic reliant.  They have put themselves out of the elite category because they lack in other parts of the game.  You dingus."
"Blake mastered a ton of other skills over the course of his career to bolster his game so as to not rely on athleticism as much. John Wall is coming back from a heavy injury and is playing pretty well, and has additionally always been one of the best passers in the league. Dwight is still a good defender because of positioning. How are you going to say they don't have fundamentals, classic case of armchair GM.  Plenty of players have adjusted over time to rely less on their athleticism."
"If they want to destroy their chances of rebuilding anytime soon, yes.   If they want to lose John Wall and a protected first for basically nothing, no."
"Today I learned I could be an NBA executive.  But for real, anyone who who thinks an athletic reliant player will have a good back end career is a fool.  Please see how that turned out for drose, Dwight, Blake griffin, John wall...Russell Westbrook to name a few.  All these players were phenomenal but without having the basic fundamentals of the game, you’re bound to burn in a flame. These players are simply not meant to last."
"What kind of contracts are DeAngelo Russell, John Wall, and Russell Westbrook on?"
At this point in the season I’d take John Wall over WB by a mile.
So he has the potential to be someone like John Wall?
"i don't *hate* the Rockets, just fuck em ^^^^John ^^^^Wall ^^^^a ^^^^beast  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
"My guy, you really gonna call me dumb when you say dumb shit like this?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I’m already 100% more invested in these new Rockets then that isso bitch ball.  We got John Wall to run our offense, ISO ball isn't going anywhere lmfao. You are clearly clueless on what you are talking about if you cant comprehend that. Not to mention you tried to say big salary = leader. Actually delusional."
Lmao you wanna talk about the better franchise? Look at what your stupid FO did with John Wall.   You traded him for WestBrick 😂  Do you cry now when you watch Wall play?  Clearly the Wizards got hustled in that trade you even gave up a pick.  So let's not talk about the stupid franchise that attracts washed up players who can't even control their emotions on the court.  There's a reason why people want Bradley Beal to play for a real team. Even his own wife!   Lol bro this is not your season so save your arguments for next year.
Because in 2021 Bradley Beal is better than John Wall. Y'all gotta let 2016 go
"John Wall, Andray Blatche, JaVale McGee  (+ Nick Young)"
They have played like 5 games together. I think Wall and Wood will be fine. John needs to find him more with the pnr
He's been pretty good but it's been 10 games and John Wall was one of the best point guards in the NBA in his prime. He has not shown to be that good still.
"Wall at his absolute best doesn’t touch this version of beal, come on. He’s averaging 30+ on elite effeincy, John wall always hovered around 50% TS"
6-4 record when John Wall plays. James Harden was still a member of the Houston Rockets in all 4 of those losses (2 losses against the second best team in the West).
"Isn't John Wall right now actually playing pretty damn good again?  The last few years were more sad than bad.  But man, his early healthy days he was a fun blur to watch."
John Wall of 2017 and 2018 is not the John Wall playing nowadays
I think because he’s better at basketball then John wall
"Most people don’t watch games. They just look at the box score. Replace Bradley Beal with John Wall and the Washington Wizards aren’t 3-11. Bradley Beal is a better player, but John Wall is a much better leader.   Bradley Beal can’t be the only All star caliber player on a team. He’s a third option at best on a championship team that has an elite defensive big."
Because he is better than John Wall
Bradley Beal is considered to be better than John Wall because he is better than John Wall
"john wall, christian wood, demarcus cousins, pj tucker, danuel house, sterling brown, tate at some point is word. all houston rockets"
Your John Wall flair reminds me that Cal did that shit 4 years prior too.
"I honestly think the current rockets in their prime would be really good. Prime Boggie Cousins, John wall, Oladipo, Tucker, Eric Gordon, along with Christian wood and the rest of the roster"
"Lol forgot John Wall was in the west huh  Definitely not a lock, but he’ll be close"
Probably so jealous of John Wall rn haha
"That’s John Wall street, bet ween the legs dribbling"
"He signed his extension after a 32-50 season with no healthy John wall in sight and no other assets to speak of. It was very clear to anyone who was watching that the wizards were not going to be any good anytime soon unless Rui turned into an all star caliber player his sophomore season or they signed a major free agent. He wanted the bag and he got it and now this is why he has to live with at the moment. To be fair to him and give him credit, he’s been handling it with absolute class so far and has been putting in his best effort night in and night out, but the wizards being this bad shouldn’t be a shock to anyone."

"Kevin Love, John Wall, Dreymond Green, Jrue Holiday, and Nassir Little."
"You know, people had this response when I said similar things about Russ and John Wall and Wiggins before everybody came around to my viewpoint on them, too."
Trade everyone and John wall is just gonna have to take one for the team
"5 years is a long time.  5 years ago, the Clippers had CP3, Blake, and DJ.   4 years ago, they traded CP3  3 Years ago, they traded Blake.   One year out of the playoffs   Then back in. And we didn't have anyone has good as John Wall or Christian Wood on the team that year."
2014 east vs west dunk contact where John Wall awkwardly won
Poor John Wall. He had a really sick one there too as I recall.
John Wall won a dunk contest where I’m pretty sure he only did 1 dunk.
"No lol, the one where John Wall won when it looked like it was a pregame routine was the worst."
2014 was the John Wall win right? That wasn’t bad
Worst since that John Wall team dunk contest whenever that year was
Not as bad as the John Wall dunk contest.  Just thinking about it is ugh *shivers*
"John wall year was the worst, no one knew what was goin on"
Many years ago John Wall bounced an alley oop pass to Blake Griffin and I've always wanted to see that again.
"The biggest proof of this was when 2 of the first players to get busted and have their contracts voided for PED use were Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis in 2012.   Hmmm, 2 of the notoriously worst contracts in the NBA at the time both also got ""randomly"" caught for PEDs when they put their new testing in place.  Don't be surprised if the next positive PED tests are from John Wall and Tobias Harris."

John wall “ i need a big” lol
"Watching the rockets tonight for a bit and it felt like they played like they still had James Harden on the team, just no ball movement and john wall and oladipo isolation"
"I got downvoted in a thread last week saying John Wall is the worst contract in the NBA and I had no clue why so I assumed Wall has a small legion of Stans still. Do real people actually think he’s still a good player, let alone one making over $42 million a year until Summer 2023?"
Legend says /u/_ProdiG_ is still trying to locate John Wall

"No. John wall gets to the rim a lot, but is a pretty mediocre finisher"
I believe John Wall had a Points/Assists/Steals triple double in his third NBA game  or maybe he only had 9.  I know he had a lot though.
People used to have to ask why Harden was still in while we were winning in blowouts.  Now they ask why is John Wall still in the game even though we're getting blown out.  You hate to see it.
Chill out John Wall😭
I think they were all in on wood and the john wall boogie cousins project
You clearly don’t remember the John Wall dance at Kentucky. Shit was fire
John Wall is so easy to dislike.
JVG is right. Been saying it our entire loss streak   We play way too much isolation for our best isolation player to be John Wall
"John Wall will probably have murder on his mind tonight. He’ll drop 40 in a double OT thriller, and we’ll win because Harden will drop 82 in the first 4 quarters/the first OT(but go scoreless in the second OT)."
"I really hope they don’t split but it’s not something they control.  I remember when John Wall’s mom died, he and Brad Beal mourned together in a very similar way.  They’re like brothers off the court but it doesn’t matter to the FO.  I hope Portland doesn’t do Dame and CJ like Washington did Wall and Beal.  They’re definitely one of my favorite backcourts in the league now that my boys are split :’("
"Exactly. I don’t understand why when basketball is your career, and in 1 year the first overall pick will make more money than most of us in our lifetime, why it’s seen as virtuous to go BS your way through 5 months of college classes. The NCAA is a hell of a lobbying entity. Screw that, so many of these guys have family struggling, I remember when John Wall signed his contract and talked about providing for family. If you talk to a smart CPA/financial advisor and have a $100 million contract, you can structure trusts and estates so that generations after you will never have to worry about food, housing, college and can pursue anything they want. Go get that NBA money. I would rather Emoni Bates have it than Steve Ballmer, or whoever."
"I'm not 100% sure where you're coming from with the ""Rockets easily won that trade"" considering John Wall is playing and the rockets haven't had a win since Feb 4th, while Westbrook is also playing and the Wizards have been going streaking.   Last I checked, it was good to win games. And John Wall has done none of that."
"But John Wall, the person they traded Westbrook for, has been playing in all of those 12 consecutive losses?"
"This is why guys like PJ Tucker, Danuel House, Ben Mclemore and Eric Gordon didn't get offended with his comments compared to the new guys John Wall and Boogie Cousins. He gave them everything he could"
"this year definately not, but there are alot of players that compete before they become established stars. have people forgotten that dame,john wall, paul george, giannis, lavine, etc have participated in the contest in recent history?"
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
"We could probably be a playoff team as soon as next season   It all depends on what direction we take. We have a chance of keeping our pick this year, and we have our pick next year. So tanking is an option, though tanking usually takes more than 2 seasons, and being awful further than that will only help okc not us   We also will have some good cap space to work with if instead of tanking we want to be competitive. Next season we have about 23m in the cap to use, and if we find a way to get rid of Gordon for an expiring or straight into someone’s cap, we will have basically a max slot   John Collins or Gary Trent Jr are decent options I wouldn’t be mad at if we overpaid slightly.   Wall Trent KPJ Tate Wood is a decent team. It’ll depend on the depth and coaching but it’s not hopeless   It all depends on how we draft with the low picks we’ll get from Brooklyn and bucks and trailblazers.   The ultimate goal is to retool to a low playoff level team. And wait until Brooklyn becomes old when we have their 2025, 26 and 27 picks unprotected"
Simmons and John Wall  Giannis and Westbrook  Siakam and Lebron  Sabonis and Zion
"Some of the shit you all say on here is so disrespectful. There are more “efficient” players that wish they could impact the game or accomplish a fraction of what Russ has. I doubt you’re even half as talented at whatever you do as Russ is at the game of basketball. And you’re a Wizards fans on top of it all. Your boyfriend John Wall has never been as good as Russ at any point in his career. So if Russ is so dumb, why can’t so many of these other “smarter” players seem to do any better."
"Nonsense.  He’s had a minor injury that kept him from finding some consistency in the starting lineup.  He also struggled in OKC where the offense was run by Westbrook, who demanded the ball 90% of possessions - and that’s basically John Wall.  Oladipo is worth the investment."
"&gt; I'm baffled by one friend I have that only ever gets meat and cheese on their burgers and tacos.  I know John Wall is like this.  Orders burgers plain, not even with cheese."
It changes depending on the different narratives of the seasons. This year I like the rockets cause I want to see the John wall revival but they aren't good so I'm cheering for Dame for holding it down and not making a superteam. And also cause I'd love to see Carmelo get a ring.
"And the other one's name is Carmelo, not Melo.  Melo is a nickname for Carmelo and LaMelo just like John is a nickname for Jonathan. Do you refuse to call John Wall ""John"" because he doesn't deserve to use John Stockton's nickname?"
I bet you also get mad that John Wall goes by John without ever getting permission from John Stockton.  Melo is his fucking name. It's not some made up nickname
It's even crazier when you realize Jeremy Lin had elite combine stats. Talking Derrick Rose/John Wall level speed.
De’aron fox gets the John wall nod for his speed with the ball. Not saying you’re wrong or I disagree. Just that’s the kind of player people think of
"Fuck man, not John Wall"
"I’ve said it before but idk if it’s just me but I see more John Wall then D Rose in him.  D Rose had a killer/attack first mentality. Ja seems to like to get his teammates involved first before score, the same way Wall is."
"I mean Beal has won 3 first round series in 8 years with the Wizards. All lead by John Wall.   Beals only success was making the 8th seed in the East when Wall played 41 games. With Wall they went 23-18, when injured they went 15-21. Beal has never led this team to win anything yet. Beal played second fiddle to Wall for years and hasn’t don’t anything since in postseason."
"I said he was a below average athlete by nba standards which is completely true and factual. By looking at his basketball reference pads, I gave him more credit than he deserved. He was more replacement level than average.   I also said he got way more famous than his basketball talents would suggest. Which is also true and factual. He has to have the highest career earnings of someone with such lousy numbers.   I’m telling truths and you’re out here talking about he could beat John Wall in a race."
"When Lynn was drafted/undrafted/came into the NBA, he had a better lateral, 3/4 quart sprint, and benchpress then Derrick Rose John Wall and Russell Westbrook. The man was incredibly athletic but… He lacked a vertical wingspan and skin melanin  By the way… Jimmy Butler is probably the most athletic player drafted in the last 10 years off his combine statistics don’t @ me"
"No, you were saying he was unathletic and that he just got attention because he's Asian.  That's literally the whole point Lin was making about racism in the NBA stupid. Only you're creating this narrative that people are saying he's a 30-10 guy, nobody ever said that.  At one point in his career he was as fast as John Wall, that's it.  That doesn't mean he's the next Michael Jordan or Derrick Rose"
His most famous dunk was literally on John wall during the summer league. Did you just start watching basketball?
Don't forget that he was faster than John Wall in the combine and stronger too and people for whatever reason said he wasn't athletic enough.

"Yeah I totally get most people didn’t think he could make it either in d1 colleges or in the nba. But that’s also kinda Lin’s point, he had the physical tools, really strong slashing skills, and statistics to make a rly strong case for playing in the nba and/or d1 ball — and he still was severely overlooked.  But it’s nothing to lose sweat over in an argument since he ended up making the league anyways. I just think sometimes there are implicit biases in sports — ie asians are not as athletic as black or even white athletes, or Asians are intellectual athletes. Which is funny since Lin was the exact opposite of the stereotypes: he was extremely athletic (almost as fast as John fucking Wall at the combine) but wasn’t the most calculated or intellectual in his approach to the game"
Would have been a first in October if they didn't convince themselves that John Wall and Cousins would be enough to get Harden to change his mind.
This the same guy that said John Wall will never succeed in the NBA because he has no father figure
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"They wouldn't want Kemba anyway, they have John Wall.  All of this is hypothetical based on what Boston would want.  What Houston wants isn't compatible.  So it's irrelevant."
In theory yes. But rockets don’t take kemba because they already have John Wall
"Idk man watching him throw that ball 5 feet away from John wall did it for me. That’s not a valuable player. That’s a shmuck. But hey, to each their own"
I think Giannis’ passing is his most underrated aspect. He is honestly a very good playmaker thanks to the training Kidd made him do with John Stockton. I think teams will try to build a wall for Zion let’s just see how effective it is. We need to realise that a ‘wall’ can only be built with certain personnel and not every team can build one. I think ppl are confused as to what a ‘wall’ really is
"Why would the celtics want to do that? They're 4 months removed from Kemba shooting 57% TS in the playoffs for them as he finished off an all star season.   John wall is 4 years removed from his last healthy, impactful season.   If the Celtics have that many question marks about his health that they're moving on, it absolutely wont be for the one PG with more injury questions."
John Wall only played 41 games. 1/2 of the whole season. They would not have been the 8th seed with him healthy.

"Nah. Kemba’s contract is a year longer.  John Wall is great on both ends, something Kemba won’t ever be."
"Because John Wall is much better than Kemba and with Marcus Smart's contract ending they'll most likely be over the cap anyway the next two years.   What good is a mid to late first for a team that needs to stay competitive and convince the Jays to stick around through their prime. I guarantee the owners, front office, players, and fans would much rather be fighting for a top 3 seed and competing in the playoffs then potentially finishing 5-6 and not being any real threat in the first / second round."
They definitely could. Smart preferably would come of the bench and be the playmaker when Wall rest.  Even at end of games it’s not like I want Smart shooting much so he can just stand out at the 3pt line and play amazing defense.  I just want the team to be fun again. It is painful watching our games. John Wall is a fun player and that is definitely a step in the right direction.
Kemba Walker and a 1st for John Wall
"Luka has some good acceleration with the ability to change direction quickly. He may not be fast like prime John Wall, but it is nearly impossible to stop him from driving to the hoop 1 on 1."
John Wall was definitely the best PG in the league at one point
John Wall won that year.
This is [john wall on lonzo](https://youtu.be/YxWiSiTPfWk)  all over again
"It wasn’t as common till the last 15 years. Triple doubles were way rarer than current pace, Kidd was amazing in NJ and didn’t get that many. There certainly been an explosion of triple doubles lately led by LBJ, Russ, Harden. But it’s not commonplace.   John wall is no slouch. Kidd was at his peak in NJ. Just wasn’t as common before this generation of players"
If John Wall didn't break his hand the Wizards would have beat them.
John Wall
"Zion over Brandon Ingram, Demar Derozean, Devin Booker, Deaaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Christian Wood, John Wall, and so many others? I don't agree. Zion's game is limited and his team isn't good. How do the Spurs not have one all star? They're the fifth seed!"
"I never said I would want to play with Russ.  And when I say he's super fun to watch I mean live and in good seats.    The only other person I've seen in person faster on the court I can think off the top of my head is Aaron Brooks (I've never seen John Wall live, the recent Wizards games I've gone too he was injured, and the other Wizards games I went to still had Agent 0 on them)"
After years of John Wall trying to get Boogie to join him in DC they finally join up in Houston just for him not to work out there and eventually land in DC after Wall got traded.  Can you imagine... lol
"John wall, but dust has not settled. Russ is still dealing with injury and I’d like to see how he looks if/when he fully recovers."
I think it’s close rn between the two. I’d prolly give the edge to John wall tho but I think Russ could definitely have a better year from here on out. This will be one of those trades where we won’t know who won until the end of the year
"Yes, he’s literally averaging just 1 assist more. It’s not about the numbers, they don’t count him because of the way he left Houston.  He saw the writing on the wall and called it out. Did you honestly think Harden + John Wall + Christian Wood + Demarcus Cousins is getting past Bron and AD? If he’s stayed, it would have hurt his career more."
He’s been a locker room headache as usual according to reports. His buddy John Wall was not even opposed to his departure.
I thought he looked good for you guys. And the combination with John Wall was fun. Has he been bad lately or something?
i’m a wizards fan but from utah so #takenote plus it’s hard to cheer for the wizards this season because john wall is my favorite player ever and i’ve always fucking hated westbrook like top 3 least favorite players smh
"He did against John wall, Russ, Dwight Howard, obviously not as respected as cp3 but still pretty respected players, you can’t hold back against people just because they are good or he’ll look like a punk. But I do see where your coming from."
Kris Dunn would be the next coming of John Wall
John Wall would be a HOF
Not as much as John Wall tearing his Achilles in the shower.
"Give us some credit man.  We’ve just knocked off Boston, Denver, Portland and now the defending champs. Yes it was the Rockets as well but that’s a motivated John Wall trying his best to humiliate us again.  We’ve come from 0-5 and dead last to now being a threat for the Playoffs."
Rockets look like they have no idea what to do on offense. Hand to John Wall so he can run into people and not get the foul call.
"He snuck on the third team one time lmao and has never been a DPOY finalist. He’s not that good. The nets sucking isn’t a pipe dream, it’s highly unlikely harden/kyrie/kd run it back after contracts are over, the lifespans of super teams are shorter then you think.  Why would the rockets not sniff the playoffs? They were in the mix until there best player went down and oladipo as missed like every game which is why we’re playing so bad.   Ben Simmons with John wall would have been a disaster.  I do know how difficult it is to be a playoff team, which is why I said simmons isn’t worth it. At best simmons leads us to a early 4-1 exit in the first round.  The sixers were also shit at drafting. They traded an extra asset to get fultz for tatum, and then drafted jahlil okafor lmfao.  Simmons is not a top 15 player, you’re out of your mind lol. Off the top of my head in no order:  Lebron, AD, harden, kyrie, kd, embiid, giannis, middleton, sabonis, Tatum, brown, butler, bam, Trae, vuc, beal, towns, shai, wood, zion, luka, steph, jokic, dame, booker, kawhi, PG are all better players and I’m probably missing a bunch. He’s not that good."
"SikaM, Randle, iPad,  Grant,  John wall, lamelo ball"
John Wall is a blood. Does that count?
"Houston sports have been rough lately  KPJ, Tate, Christian Wood and John Wall are the only bright spots in this weird season"

Kemba and a 2nd for John Wall?
"Its still gotten much better over the years. Sixers , Bucks, Nets have far higher ceilings than IT Boston, Demar Raps, or John Wall Wizards"
"In today’s game? A ton of families are living paycheck to paycheck. Basketball is not like golf or tennis where participation is limited to those who can pay. It’s a sport where everyone regardless of socioeconomic class can play, which results in a high number of top prospects growing up in poverty, without a father, etc. John Wall, LeBron, etc  A lot of them don’t even have parents. Trust me, I know. I know quite a few of them"
Don't you dare talk about John Wall like he ain't worth all the quarter billion dollar we paid him!! Worth every penny!! May he play well in Houston with 1 leg. Good luck my guy!
"Gang Signs John Wall and Gang Sign Demar Derozan deserve shout outs , no?"
"Russ is a tremendous teammate. He helps develop players and establishes a winning culture. I bet Wiz fans are happy to have him over John Wall at this juncture.  That being said, he is very, very streaky this year. That MVP season was something incredible to watch -- particularly that shot to win against Denver. That being said, you can't deny that he has been awfully hit or miss this year.  Wiz aren't exactly out of playoff contention yet. Personally, I hope they pull it together and sneak in."
He isn’t doing it efficiently (.436/.321/.619) and he’s averaging 5 turnovers a game. Also the wizards look no better with him then they did with John Wall. There are reasons people are snoozing on him
He's been in the league 3 years and is already a top 5 player. What do you want people to talk about? John Wall?
"He's not as bad as John Wall overall.  He's almost exactly as bad at John Wall at scoring this year, which is what I said above."
? If you think you have more wins with Wall than you would Westbrook you’re just delusional. I didn’t realize you thought John Wall was on par with a former MVP. I guess I’m the clown though? 🤡🤡
"Don't be ridiculous, he's not John Wall level bad. His creation is still elite, even with the wizards being the worst 3pt shooting team in the league. He's also been far more efficient in the second half of the season, such as the Pacers game recently or the last game."
"Kings, have you considered trying not to suck?   Honorary mention to John Wall And WB but Luke Walton is the MVP of The Great Tankathon"
I once saw Draymond and John Wall hanging out at the W in Beverly Hills once. He lives it up with opposing players just like everyone else lol.
"The advanced stats can basically be summarized as him getting steadily worse at scoring every single year as the rest of the league gets steadily better, basically turning from prime Kobe levels of volume/efficiency in his MVP to post-Achilles year John Wall this season."
John wall got hurt going down the stairs freak accidents happen
"Nice, the list is growing...  - Brisbane Bullets: Kevin Martin, Khris Middleton  - SEM Phoenix: John Wall, Danté Exum, Zach Randolph, Josh Childress, Al Harrington  - Sydney Kings: Andrew Bogut   - NZ Breakers: Shawn Marion, Matt Walsh, Victor Oladipo"
John Wall *right now* is nowhere near as good as Lowry was in 2019
"I have a Tim Duncan jersey that my brother gave me, it's really faded though, I think my father got it in the early 2000s. I also have a Dirk 2011 Finals T-Shirt jersey, a John Wall Wizards T-Shirt jersey, and Paul George's 2013 All-Star jersey but the front text is missing (I got it at a cheap store lol). All my other NBA gear is just Lakers stuff (about 25+ shirts and jerseys)."
[john wall game 6 v celtics in 2017 :')](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Qg80DoMlZU)
it doesn’t matter if y’all wanted it. that’s the reality y’all live in. john wall representing for houston is the best thing that’s happened to y’all’s franchises on months.
"&gt;John Wall’s fit next to everyone seems very, very awful  Huh?  Wall has been in top 5 for assists in the league multiple times in his career and a number of his teammates have had career shooting years playing with him, or even rehabbed their careers.  He probably  wouldn't be a good choice against another high usage star like Luka but there are a number of teams where he could make a sizable positive impact."
"I love Jalen, and I hope he keeps improving as a player and become an even bigger value to the team.  Having said that, he's most likely in that JJ Barea role going forward of being a phenomenal 6th man who can light a spark under the team and push us forward when the starters are resting...  But I don't see him as a perennial starter on a team that wants to go for glory.  But on the other hand, with Doncic being a guy that operates best with the ball in his hands, we don't need a traditional ball-heavy guard either. And John Wall would be a poor fit.  For all intents, Luka IS the Point Guard for the Mavs and that won't change. They need to keep building around him by adding more capable players who Doncic can play off.  Jalen works well in that regard too, he's a great spot shooter on top of being able to handle the ball when Luka isn't on the court. 84% of his made 3s come off an assist, too.  The thing that the Mavs need most is probably a secondary playmaker, who can get assists if Luka is not on the court or otherwise not able to set others up."

Will John Wall do a speech everytime he has a good game?
John Wall burner spotted.
A lot of people are still thinking about john wall?
that's tank commander John Wall. put some respect in his name
&gt; If last year we got AD and John Wall with a solid group of role players you telling me they can't win it all vs that heat team?  They would either miss the playoffs or lose in the first round.  AD and Jrue Holiday won 34 games in 2017 and Holiday was light years ahead of where Wall is today.
"Fuck u mean, you talk like John Wall can consistently win games you y’all lmao, you all forgetting last 30 games he played?"
"Man you just skipped over me saying ""if he changed his shot selection"" he has the skills to be the 2nd best player on a championship team not every season is there gonna be a super stacked team. It just feels that way. If last year we got AD and John Wall with a solid group of role players you telling me they can't win it all vs that heat team?"
"If you really loved Houston, you would go retire John 'Brick' Wall."
Dude what. The 2nd best players on the championship contenders are harden and AD lmao. Trash take. John wall as a 2nd option isn’t winning a playoffs series let alone a ring now
John Wall has a heart of a lion like Russ
"Who even thinks of John Wall anymore, lol"
"There are dudes in their 50s and 60s who still try to go to the gym every day to play pickup, and you’re wondering why John Wall, who is young and paid tens of millions of dollars to play in front of thousands of fans in the best league in the world, might be motivated to keep playing basketball for the Houston Rockets?"
Of course Tillman will but John Wall would be dumb to let that happen
"John Wall doing everything right, just over a year from being a free agent.   I hope he stays healthy."
John Wall has made $50 million less than Blake
Luka had a 2021 John Wall night playing against 2021 John Wall. Not his best performance. Why was KP not getting the ball more? Was clear Luka's shot wasn't falling
"Hol up, you mean 12/23 from the field. I did a double take that John Wall got to the line 23 times and then shot the FT's with a Shaq percentage."
"I’m taking about the players, you think John Wall is going to give up part of $47 million next year? Fuck the rings lol"
John wall had an efficient night!?!? Don't like him acting like the franchise player but I gotta give it to him tonight
Don't most Rocket fans want Ls right now in fear of the OKC pick swap. If John Wall puts together of string of good games instead of leading the tank...
Damn cant believe im ready to take multiple bullets for John Wall
Love to see John Wall still be John Wall.
"John Wall is a 30% 3 point shooter who happened to have a good shooting night. Wall got switched on to Luka and he fouled him a couple of more times giving him and 1s too.  Olynyk has 2 offensive rebounds and 16 defensive, that's not on KP, a lot of rebounds just went to him lol."
John Wall smiling. Rare
John wall doing tank commander things
John wall hasn’t been playing good defense and his his playmaking hasnt meant shit since no one respects him as a scorer anymore.
Kemba has been way better than wall this year. John wall has 50% TS lol.
"I’ve been on Reddit way too much today, but I’m really enjoying this thread. Good job, OP. I don’t have a great hot take currently but my hot take for this season was that John Wall was gonna have a better season than Westbrook. It looked good for a little bit lol."
"I'm not going to debate you that Edwards needs to be a good 3pt shooter to be an effective player (I think you underselling his ability to drive to the rim which can be extremely elite and his defensive potential).  Second the limitation is not accounting for volume, while volume is a variable that should be considered, the point I was making is that a raw 3% is suitable to alot of noise because there are abuch of uncounted variables that you are ignoring, and the overall assumption that good 3% == being a good shooter is incorrect . I mean look at your own chart you provided do you think that Otto Porter is a better shooter than PG, Kemba, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker ... the list goes on. Also consider in 2016 Bradley Beal avg 7.6 3pt attempts having a 40% percentage, this season he is averaging 6.5 attempts at 33% if you just looked at it you would think Beal became worse at shooting but this is the wrong conclusion the reason why the drop off happened is that in 2016 he had John Wall in his prime and Beal was a second option making his shots alot more easier, but it is also obvious in the last 5 years Beal has become a much better shooter and scorer.  Because of these factor your cannot properly test your hypothesis that players do not get better at shooting."
"Lol, you think its a coincidence that as soon as Harden goes down KD decides to suit up? The Nets have been saying for 3+ weeks now that if this were Playoffs he'd be playing. They were winning so why rush to put him back on the court. KD was at MVP level early on this season of an Achilles injury, he's not John fucking Wall, he's KD."
And then went on the shelf for two months lmao.  How's John wall doing? Achilles won.
"that was supposed to be last year, with everyone hyped about john wall coming back to play with beal and deni 😔😔"
"No order:  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  John Wall   Russell Westbrook  Derrick Rose  Tony Parker  Kyrie Irving  Rajon Rondo  Kyle Lowry  Damian Lillard  Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas and Kemba Walker are very close"
"John Wall lead the Wizards to arguably their most successful period in their history. Dude isn’t a loser, he just got several really bad injuries in his prime."
John Wall would like a word
"Curry, CP3, Westbrook, Kyrie, Dame, John Wall, Lowry, Kemba, Tony Parker, and Rose."
"Cp3, Steph, Westbrook, Kyrie, dame, Tony Parker, rondo, drose, John wall, Lowry"
"*Embiid would have jumped into Stewart   I agree though, but Jokic is getting less FTA than even players like Simmons, Curry, even John Wall who all have good passing and are way weaker than he is."
"1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Dwight Howard  5. Chauncey Billups  6. Derrick Rose  7. Rajon Rondo  8. Bradley Beal  9. Avery Bradley  10. Michael Jordan  To change it to people I grew up watching, I'd swap out Hakeem and MJ for Kobe and Paul Pierce"
James Johnson?John wall? I’d probably add demar and dame in there too
"It's a necessary distinction though. By definition, everyone in the NBA is athletic. Compared to the average population, even semi-pro leagues are in the top 10% of athleticism. But in comparison to each other, we know who is more athletic than most. John Wall used to be ungodly fast, but he's slowed a touch. Jokic is simply not athletic by NBA standards. Big Baby? Old Perkins? Just not athletic anymore. Players that have to rely more on savvy than just blowing past everyone and dunking it are less athletic. Either because of nature or because of age. I mean, think back to young Rose or Westbrook. Those guys just needed a little space and they were at the bucket all day."
John Wall
John wall would like a word
Rockets without John Wall and Boogie Cousins
"It seems to me that *athletic* is mostly used to describe players that can jump very high **and** are also fast. So Kyrie might be described as non-athletic because he doesn't dunk like Westbrook or John Wall from a few years back, even if he has comparable quickness and speed.   It's really an incredibly narrow definition of athleticism."
"John Wall is not good, dude. He would've shot them out of the game early."
John Wall being out helps you guys lol
The rockets just did this well without John wall...im excited to see what happens next season
JOHN WALL
What's the john wall story
~~John Wall~~   ~~IT4~~  ~~Dame~~  Kyrie
"The league needs to come to the collective realization that these spot up 3 point shooting wings and bigs will always be overrated no matter how accurate they are if they never show the potential to evolve beyond that role. You'd think people would have caught on after the Parsons, Batum, Oubre, Otto Porter, Bertans etc contracts but it keeps happening.   Their shooting is as much a product of the coaching system they play in and the shot creators they play alongside. It's telling that 3 of those guys I mentioned got paid for playing alongside a healthy John Wall and now look like huge over pays.  Like, yes it is such a valuable skillset for a role player to have but if that guy can only shoot or pump fake and dribble drive then they will never be worth that much and you're just tanking the entire team if you sign them for that much."
Yeah from what I remember KD's hype really took off when he was at Texas.  Whereas Wiggins coming out of HS was legitimately being called the next  (maple) Jordan/Lebron hybrid.  John Wall also had a crazy amount of hype coming out too.
Looking like Tank Commander John Wall won't play tonight. We'll get more of KPJ running the show again.
John Wall and Kawhi come to mind.
He wasn’t in Covid protocol or he wouldn’t have played the first game of the season. John Wall and others were in Covid protocol.
Surprised there's not more John Wall here. He was super hyped coming out of high school
No John Wall?
"Jokic is the new lillard or John wall, a recognizably great player who fans just assume casuals are oblivious to"
Got John Wall and Eric Bledsoe paid too
John Wall got paid for being a tank commander and no one literally want his contract
They have no plan. Not for John wall or for their franchise. Waste some maybe all of his remaining good years then let him walk would be my guess
John “Tank Commander” Wall
Lakers don’t want john wall.
John Wall and Jalen Suggs gonna be a duo
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Comparing them to OKC and Houston is kind of ridiculous. Houston has John Wall and Cousins. OKC is a bit more comparable but they made the playoffs last year and kept their young star that helped, plus have a young stud in Dort.  Hinkie tanked for **four years in a row** and literally sent out a long memo explaining why he did it. It was more than blatant. OKC and Houston are taking little hits from a vape pen in the back of the class, Hinkie was taking bong rips and blowing it in the teachers face. It's a whole different level."
That one span that included John Wall is a murderers row of first overall picks.
But prime John Wall is better than Simmons
John Wall is the perfect average #1 pick imo
"not just point guards. someone like bradley beal can play in tight spaces just as well as john wall or russ, and needs to operate there for the offense to function as the secondary ball handler.   which is what the 2g is on offense. the scorer/secondary ball handler hybrid. emphasis on the secondary ball handler part.  its a prerequisite to play the position. its why kobe, mj, tmac were special. wing size but guard body control and reaction time. so they were able to use that advantage at 2g.  if you cant move that way, you play a wing spot if you're big enough. if you arent, you dont play.  this isnt arbitrary but literally a requirement based on what guards do.  kd is a center size w swing movement and skills, so he uses the advantage there.  this also isnt about playmaking. jokic can run an offense but doesnt move like a guard, same with lebron, same with giannis, same w bill walton or wilt.  kd can catch the ball anywhere b hes tall. but he needs space to dribble and move. which is why vs pat bev he had to shoot pass or post after not being able to dribble in game 1"
"He’s not over 30, first off.   Secondly, max contracts change year to year, so you can’t use the actual numbers as comparison. That’s not how it works.  Anyway...  Chris Paul got a max over 30. Dame Lillard got a **supermax** at 30. Klay Thompson got a max at 30. Kyle Lowry got a max at 30.  If we bump it down to just one year younger...  Westbrook got a **supermax** at 29. John Wall got a **supermax** at 29. Kemba got a max at 29. Steph Curry got a max at 29. Jimmy Butler got a max at 29. Mike Conley got a max at 29.  Should I keep going?"
"Not a single player in history has ever come back from a serious injury and looked the same.  Klay next season will be on a minutes restriction and will either have a lot of scheduled rest or he be sidelined anyways from aggravating past injuries.  When Gordon came back from his ankle repair, he was a shell of himself and didn't even play half the season.  John Wall back after 2 years is the same.  Has played a ton and when he does, doesn't have the pop in his step that he used to.  KD is about the only dude that came back from a serious injury and looked as unstoppable as he ever did... except for the fact that after 3 weeks on the court, he hasn't played since."
THAT IS JOHN WALL KINDA MONEY
Yeah I wouldn't compare DSJ's ability to get to the hoop and score to Russell Westbrook. Russell Westbrook is one of the greatest driving guards of all time. John Wall is one of the fastest most athletic PGs since AI
"Cowherd is the guy that said John Wall would never be a good leader because he didn't have a father. Wall's father died when John was 8.   He is an absolute hack and shock jockey, and nothing basketball related that comes out his mouth should be given consideration"
"Of course it has value, but are you not smart enough to understand that these numbers on poor efficiency is actually the opposite of valuable? You realise why some teams have better offenses than others right?  Look at Oladipo’s numbers in Houston. 20 of the most invaluable points in the league, same for John Wall.   Come on bro, surely you’re smarter than that"
2022-2023 john wall will be making 47 million
"&gt; When he signed the contract it was absolutely the right deal  [They signed it with 2 years left on his original deal.](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/21/16013566/john-wall-wizards-free-agency-supermax-extension-signed)  Signing him to a supermax as a player who was never at any time a top 10 player was probably moderately bad, doing it in advance when they still could have offered more than anyone else when his original contract came up and bidding against themselves was an unbelievably bad move."
"John Wall is making $41 mil this year, $44 mil next year, and $47 mil the year after that. I don't think Horford's is nearly that bad"
"Yeah, you rarely see him take a bad fall. I'm a big Wizards guy, and one of the things I remember most about John Wall is all the nasty falls he took after laying the ball in at high speed."
"Kyrie is still surprising because voters will often give votes to multiple members of top seeded teams.  Just like how Manu and Joakim Noah have gotten votes in the past.  Keep in mind, voters HAVE TO vote for 5 guys and it's very often just a 1 or 2 horse race. So votes 3-5 can be just paying respect to someone impactful. Even John Wall has gotten a vote before, I don't think we ever finished higher than 4th."
"John Wall is another candidate for ""holding back my tears HOF"""
John Wall
"John Wall has the [best high school mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4CbQGBbUOw) of all time, prove me wrong"
"Yeah, but if they were healthy and legitimately making a push, John Wall, KPJ, and Wood are miles ahead of anybody on that Bobcats or 6ers team"
"If John Wall and Beal had done this a couple years ago, we’d be in a lot better place.  Not knocking them, because they stayed and that’s more than the Wizards deserved, but 5-10 mil of extra cap gets you an extra 3 and D vet."
I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's between John Wall and Chandler Parsons  Through no fault of their own
John Wall probably.
Don't forget John Wall either.
The KPJ was a nice move but the westbrook john wall trade and then they moved harden for nothing lol and then they actually did something nice by getting levert but flipped him for oladipo but trade him away for nothing too lol
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."
Among other reasons because they’ve been tanking since trading Harden &amp; John Wall got injured.... you act like Harden leaving is the only difference...
Ok. Then I’m counting 8 games where he was toxic to his team environment (as Demarcus Cousins &amp; John Wall mentioned) and he basically gave up on all his teammates.
Add John wall to this list
"I have a couple ideas, both relating to the first time a young player can enter free agency.  I think that the supermax should only count as a regular max on the books.  And even more wild, I actually would love to see the same type of thing except instead of a supermax, there is no limit. For example, the Bucks should be able to pay Giannis $80 million per year if they want and then that number only counts as a regular max contract.  You could only do this with your own players to try to keep big names in smaller markets.  I like this because it doesn't restrict the players in any way, just incentivizes them to stay for hilarious amounts of money. Also, I don't think we need to protect dumb owners from spending too much money. It's their decision. If John Wall is signed to a $400 million 5 year contract, oh well."
I don’t think anyone who watched John Wall in a game this season after the first two months thought he was any good.
honestly right now it looks like john wall. hasn’t been the same since 2018 but is still considered solid when he’s dumpster trash.
Better than John Wall.
john wall and boogie too imo
"Vucevic, Middleton, Oladipo, KLove, John Wall&gt; all possible ones from each of the last 5 all star rosters"
Canadian. Really like John Wall so now im a rockets fan. And before i was a wizards fan.....
Lopez has two more years at a pretty reasonable number that could get moved. Jrue is having the most efficient year of his career and I don’t expect him to fall off in the next 2-3 years too drastically. Let’s be real it’s the NBA too so any contract is tradable if John Wall managed to get traded
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
Hmm. I’ll trade John Wall for Cade if you throw in a second round pick.
Paul George Kawhi Leonard John Wall Dwight Howard Al Horford Kyrie Irving / Uncle Drew  Zach Lavine Donovan Mitchell Ben Simmons  Kemba Walker
Because John Wall is my favourite player and it stuck
"coming from the fanbase that thought john wall would end up better than him. sure thing, bunchofrandomletters guy."
"Actually, the Wizards team as a whole doesn't like him. Hard fouls on John Wall during the playoffs, Deni landing on his foot that landed him a season-ending injury."
Ehh I find a lot of the uber athletic guys when they lose half a step there still really athletic like Lebron and Russ and John wall to a lesser extent. I think Blake and Dwight just got injured bad tbh
Well considering defense and Spot up shooting is at least 55% of an nba game I’d have to say you made the argument for that guy. Klay has also been a 2-3 option his whole career where as Beal had to develop into the main ball handler/scorer. That’s not Klay or Beal’s fault. Before John wall had injury issues Beal’s number were almost identical to Klay’s
"I agree, I see this pretty often here. I’m not really someone who looks at advanced metrics, but I had included TS% etc. in the post because some people would be looking for that stat. Personally, I got into Basketball KD’s first OKC season (after his rookie year when the Sonics relocated) and I was a huge thunder fan right when Westbrook was a rookie.   He’s been my favourite player for over 10 years, at times it’s frustrating because fans don’t look beyond his “stat padded stats” and recognize how great of a player he truly is. I’m literally Canadian and have been to 5 Thunder vs. Raptors games cheering for OKC.   The recency bias is certainly in part to his record-setting season, I remember people were saying shit like “ah. wall for westbrook. is this even a trade? neither team upgraded.” ?? I don’t remember John Wall ever being an MVP let alone coming off 27/8/7... but it’s easy to pick on Westbrook for a couple bad games because he’s an “easy target” due to how many people are convinced he’s nothing more than a stat-padding chucker.   All I can say is watch his games. Or even watch the highlights. You can’t stat pad half court lobs or perfect passes around the a big man in the paint, you can’t stat pad jumping over 2 guys with 6” on you for a board, and you can’t stat pad his unrivalled heart and intensity.  sorry for the essay lol"
"The consensus at that time was that John Wall was one of the best defensive guards, so that isn't surprising"
John Wall (2016-17) and James Harden (2018-19) have both led the league in steals.   Russell Westbrook (2015-16) and Monta Ellis (2012-13) have both come in second.
I don’t want any part of someone who was around John Wall for an extended period of time Baze barking up the wrong tree
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"Same - absolutely love John Wall, always sad that we never really got to see what could have been with him in a Wizards uniform."
If DRose gets in you are opening the door for a lot of players who have done more than him getting in   If DRose is in the Hall you say everyone on the below list should make it today:   Kemba Walker  Tim Hardaway SR.   Shawn Marion   Rajon Rondo   Jimmy Butler   John Wall  Jermaine O’Neal   Al Horford
my favorite player is john wall.  I play like davis bertans. 90% of my shots are deep 3's and I play lazy/bad defense.
"I gotta go with John Wall for this season in a 49-point blowout loss against Memphis.   15 points, 0 rebounds, 0 assists, 0 steals, 0 blocks."
I don’t either. He gave them a heads up and they ignored him. Also the on court antics were bad imo. I was thoroughly impressed by him initially but as the rumors persisted he clearly changed the way he was playing. There was a play on offense that he dribbled around and then with 5 seconds chucked it to John Wall 30 ft from the basket. Stats however he was still great.
"Nah, I have a Dirk Nowitzki and John Wall t-shirt and love wearing them."
"Not a current NBA player, but Wilt ran a 10.9 in high school. Guessing prime LeBron, pre-injury John Wall, D. Fox would all be right up there if they trained for it."
Idk the fact you beat the Celtics while sucking so much is elite for me lol.   Rockets had the tank commander John Wall tho
"Athletic prime Rose and John Wall are close to that level explosive, but they would need to train specifically for it."
Maybe deaaron fox or prime John wall but that’s the only two I can think of
"Peak John Wall got [smoked by Olympic hurdler Aries Merritt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk4rGK6d0OY) running pretty casually, so I doubt it. Sub 11-seconds isn't that high of a bar, though. There's a big jump between 11 and 10.5, and a bigger jump from there to 10 flat."
"Prime john wall maybe? Kinda tough though since NBA players don’t train like sprinters, so form would hold them back"
Maybe a prime John Wall
Bruh we actually are this bad.  And sitting john wall helps us win.
They really made out well with the John Wall trade
"And he's a 61% winner in his career, so not that significantly better. For more examples, following examples all win % first then triple double win %: Westbrook: 61, 75% Jokic: 56, 80% Curry: 66, 100% Draymond green: 68, 97% Chris Paul: 64, 81% John wall: 46, 75% James harden: 65, 83% Giannis: 64, 84%  So a (totally unrandom top of mind) sample he improves his team win % the least when he gets a triple double.  Source: statmuse"
Bro I cannot believe he got traded 1 for 1 for john fucking wall
buh...buh..buh John wall for Westbrook is an even trade...buh
KPJ  Would be John Wall but I just don't like him at this point so he's not really polarizing
John Wall
something something cowherd john wall no father something
You can get John Wall.
2017 All Star John Wall can be shipped with 2 day delivery for that
"A thread discussing bad contracts.  This article [exists](https://sports.yahoo.com/john-wall-russell-westbrook-and-the-12-hardest-nba-contracts-to-trade-210812805.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACh6iUPs2p-CxVW9XP4dYrULdmcn8DpxOe9zjGCpOagjasQVbdVXfD1tlZ3y0V2-lY4dZsnfC3tc2Ymtb4F1dZY64Fs0rWNhhbcPWgbNtXeftmO-7tGvpov1sC4FtTGWcKFM5UOvpEYru7VJJl5qbwMEKkOjdKWuvAGH1GPGkQQc).  I bring up Russ's terrible contract and play over significant periods of time.  Russ fan: ""BUT DAME...""  This narrative is not created by me and has nothing to do with the Blazers. His contract is bad. I'm sorry that it upsets you. CJ's contract is also bad. See how I'm able to be honest about my team and its players? You should try it.  I'm glad you enjoy lots of triple doubles and a 31-36 record. Calling me toxic to get around valid criticism is childish. I'm sorry that you're not comfortable with honesty."
"What about Isaiah Thomas? Thomas averaged 29/3/6 on 63% TS%, waay better per game numbers and more efficient. Also led the better team, also 2nd team All NBA, Lowry didn't make a team. IT was also 5th in MVP voting, Lowry didn't even place.  John Wall was also arguably better in '17. He averaged 23/4/11 and 2 spg, he was All NBA 3rd team and 7th in the MVP vote. Wall also killed it in the playoffs averaging 27/4/11. Lowry was garbage in the playoffs.   The narrative that Lowry was a top PG is very revisionist. He's a great player and has been for quite a while now, but he's never been in the upper echelon of PGs."
"Dudes argument is incredibly flawed, but we can agree the lakers and team they play will obv be lower rated without lebron.  If it is a double header on tnt/esp/abc, more people will watch the other game if they were also planning on watching the laker game.   However your skepticism is correct because the bigger factor is injuries to other stars on other teams.  who the fk gunna watch rockets even with john wall? nets with 1 of their big 3, sixers with only 1 of ben/joel.     In trying to rush back the season to get the $, nba increased injuries, and decreased ratings.   its not a post lebron problem. its an injuries/rest problem"
ah right—thought you were only talking about this year. I guess overall they just traded cp3 for john wall 😬
as an athlete I'd rather break my leg than tear my achilles 🤷‍♂️ plus john wall makes more than 10 million per year than gordon hayward
[What the fuck are you talking about?](https://sports.yahoo.com/report-john-wall-wants-traded-034520907.html)
When he stops being the 7th most inefficient player in the nba. And the second most inefficient high volume shooter in front of John wall than it’ll stop. I’ve got the stats to back up him being inefficient. There is no world where edwards is considered even average efficiency this year.
John Wall could be good in some time but he never was nor will he be as good as Russ
"&gt; Also John Wall had even more time to recover from his achilles tear than Kevin Durant  do you mean... john wall had even more time away from the game meaning he lost more conditioning, practice, and has more to adjust to?  isn't that what i JUST said in my other posts"
The difference is that Hayward never an achilles tear that is known to permanently decrease players' athleticism to a very noticeable degree. Also John Wall had even more time to recover from his achilles tear than Kevin Durant yet looks significantly worse on the court and is still plagued by follow-up injuries.  Wall basically looks exactly like people fear when they hear achilles tear while Durant is the positive outlier.
"john wall been out for two years. remember how long it took hayward to be good again after his return? and that was on a GOOD team. the rockets are arse right now. i reckon give him another season to adjust to playing in this league, at this pace, against the best in the world and not just pick up games, and see what happens."
"To be fair, Russel Westbrook looked injured (because he was) and John Wall looked good to start the year.   I don’t think John Wall is completely washed but he’s way too high on himself and doesn’t look like he can be anything more than a chucker on a bad team. If he could mellow out and accept a diminished role he could be a great backup point guard on winning teams, but that’s not likely.  Westbrook is on a different level and always has been. Way better at every one of Wall’s strengths throughout their careers, and the fact everybody wrote him off early on is just blind Westbrook hate"
Because John Wall asked for a trade lol if they could get that money off the books they absolutely would have but they didn't want to give up even more picks to offload him
the Wizards really got him for John Wall
"People suggesting he's ""top 5 of his era"" have no idea, It's like they've conviently forgotten the first half of his career (Or maybe they're too young to have actually watched it)   PG's who would definitely rank above Lowry that played 8+ Seasons while he's been in the league   Steph   Dame   Harden   Westbrook   CP3  Rondo   Kyrie   Rose   Parker   Nash   Billups   &amp;#x200B;  This list doesn't include Kidd, AI etc who played against Lowry or guys like John wall who's peak was far better than Lowry's or even guys like Luka, Simmons etc that will surpass his achievements once they retire"
Fun fact  John Wall will be highest paid player in 2022-2023
John Wall and Austin Rivers mixtapes are ones that I find myself rewatching from time to time. They were cold af
"i personally have it #2. my top 5 is john wall, austin rivers, aquille carr, andrew wiggins, Josh Selby"
John Wall has the GOAT mixtape?
"The Rockets immediate future really depends on the draft lottery this year. If they land a top 4 pick, they are on their way to what could be a quick rebuild with a franchise cornerstone from this batch of draft prospects. That pick dropping to 5 would be a disaster for them.   They are also paying Eric Gordon $19mil/year for three more seasons and John Wall $44mil next year and $47 mil the year after that."
John Wall is easily the best of those four.
John Wall has the coldest mixtape. Dude was making every defender look like a fool.
I think John Wall had the filthiest mixtape.
Cant leave out John Wall and Demar Derozan
Sheesh forgot about John Wall💀☠️☠️
John Wall is and second isn’t even close.
John Wall (pre-injury) was incredibly fast.
"Raising awareness for a false narrative issue, how noble... Takes awareness away from the real work nba players do off the court like curry with malaria, john wall with leukemia, and more"
john wall going #1 was the best choice if you needed someone that can make your team better immediately. hayward wasn’t as good and pg came in as a player with 3 and d upside  2 to 8 picks are strange (with some benefit of hindsight) though
"Yea going from John Wall to scrub backup PG is a big difference. Beal wasn't that good back then ... we were winning off Wall.  Sucks we made ECSF 3/4 years after Beal was drafted ... but too many injury issues with Beal, Wall, and Porter over those 4-5 years."
"That incarnation of the Wiz was just another version of the Raptors man, phenomenal regular season team but unable to completely figure it out in the Playoffs. I don’t think they cause much issues to Lebron and Co. with or without Love.   They played some phenomenal basketball though. Prime John Wall was a pleasure to watch and that team was very underrated in the “Lebron years” in the East."
Nobody wants to talk about how John Wall was doing better with an inferior version of Beal 🤷‍♂️
He's not influential. He's a better John Wall.  The point guards coming out don't play like him.
"As a Wizards fan, I love Russ so much. He's already in my top 3 favorite Wizards/Bullets. I appreciate what John Wall did for us but Russ in on a different level!"
"Was waiting for this. I've got CP3 in my top 15 but def close to 10 than 1. I'd probably go Magic, Steph, Stockton, Nash, Kidd, Westbrook, Oscar Roberstson, Isiah, The Glove, and AI (if you count him as a PG), Kyrie, Tim Hardaway, CP3, Kevin Johnson, and Deron Williams @ 15.    Honorable mention for Dame if he keeps going what he's doing and John Wall would be in my top 10 if he could ever stay healthy.   I know I left some older players out but I feel the game had 6 evolved and some of the newer players have earned these spots."
Wall has been arguably a negative for the Rockets this year (and I love John Wall) and yes he has? Every single player on every team he's ever played on (except MAYBE Kevin Durant) speak super highly of Russ as a leader and how he gets the best from his guys. Top 20-25 range is debatable but I would put him there still
Still can't believe we traded him for fucking john wall.
The reverse John Wall layup
"nah we got a FRP out of it and russ is waaaaaay too good for where our team is rn, GOAT tank commander john wall did his job  Russ would definitely have gotten us a high enough seed to start getting a little antsy about getting trapped in purgatory,"
"Yeah, LeBron. Who didn’t get as many triple doubles as Lance Stephenson that year because getting triple doubles isn’t the same thing as having a good game.  But hey, while we’re talking about Elfrid Payton, if that scrub can pick up 17, modern guards that are actually good must be absolutely rolling right? Like Chris Paul, who has 16. Or John Wall, who has 8. Or Steph Curry, who has 7. Those newfangled 7 foot ball handlers probably have him covered though, like Durant with his 12, or Cousins with his 9. Or maybe Payton just has a knack for it and you’ve intentionally picked by far the biggest outlier in this regard to massively misrepresent how easy it is to get triple doubles.  As for pace, it is certainly up relative to the league historically, if you think the league started in 2009. As for rebounding, yeah it’s crazy how many small guys are pulling down big numbers with those long rebounds these days. That’s why a whopping 6 non-centres feature in the top 20 in the league in RPG. Not like 30 years ago where men were men and Bill Laimbeer sodomised anybody under 6’4 on court, and there were only 11 non-centres in the top 20. Of course if you want to count PFs as “bigs” then the story radically changes, where there are two non-bigs this year and... three... thirty years ago. Funny how that works."
And john wall is... Yeah
"Ben Simmons gets run off the court. No shot, no layup package, no free throws. Waste of cap space. Trade him for John Wall. The sixers would be better off."
"Honestly not too bad. He's only had one full offseason and season with the job so far.   In that time, the biggest trade was obviously the Wall-Westbrook trade which was a W for Washington. I think though that trade was a product of circumstance, John butting heads with our FO and WB wanting out of Houston was just a perfect storm. Either way good for us.  The trade to pick up Gafford from the Bulls mid season also seems like it's a pretty big W for Washington.  As for drafting, he's drafted Rui Hachimura and Deni Avdija. Rui is already a pretty solid player but has a lot of room to improve, and we didn't really get to see how good Deni can be because of how Brooks used him in his system and his injury. Overall though, I am pretty happy with these picks."
If you knew anything about the Hawks last season you’d know there were not many good things about the roster last season. Hunter started out hot then seemed to hit the rookie wall. Reddish started out super shitty then became a lot better when he was moved to the bench later in the season and played against the other teams second units. Reddish has been too  injured this year to get an actual read on him yet. Huerter was very inconsistent night to night. John Collins was good when he came back but he still missed more than a third of the season. Go ahead and look at last years roster to try to find your “but he had” guy.
John Wall in [shambles](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/15/john-wall-reggie-jackson-contracts)
As a Rox fan am very glad he is not on our team paired with John Wall holy shit that would have been awful to watch
John Wall
Him or John Wall and honestly Wall still has speed and burst that the sixers could've used today.
Nothing will beat the John Wall contract
John Wall exists.
"So many injuries this year,  ones I would add to the list that I haven't really seen mentioned in this thread:      LMA retiring because of his heart.     Klay achilles right before the season started.     Dinwiddie.   John Wall.    There's so many players we like to watch that are just out right now it's crazy."
John Wall says hi.
"Your best bet is to kidnap Sabonis, leave Porzingis in his crib, and hope it's true that all Baltics look alike to Middle America.  No one but the Rockets for John Wall would touch Porzingis' contract, and you don't want that."
"contract aside, John Wall would be terrible next to Luka.  better to just stick with KP at that point."
"That's the thing, if we trade him in the offseason, we probably either have to attach assets to get someone to bite or we get someone with a similarly awful contract ie. Kevin Love, John Wall etc."
"Boogie had way more injuries than just an Achilles. And John Wall isn’t even that bad of a player, he just has a horrible contract. He isn’t pre-Achilles injury John Wall, but he will still definitely have a career after his contract is up."
&gt;Achilles injuries in 2021 don’t really kill careers anymore.   Why because KD is still good? What about John Wall and Boogie or any other star players?
John Wall would disagree
Ahhh the good ol John Wall
"Kyrie during the regular season, Harden, AD, Jamal, James Wiseman, John Wall, Kawhi (It was contact but not enough to warrant being the sole reason of the injury) Conley, this is are all players who I think have all just gotten hurt playing, not because someone hit them or a bad landing."
"The ringer did a puff piece profile on him. If you read it and pay attention to what wood is saying you'll end up thinking ""why are you willingly sharing these anecdotes with the press? none of these stories make you look good."" egotism and lack of self awareness... With wood, whatever kpj's problem is and john wall still repping his blood past, Houston may be chasing the jail blazers or the Bengals for most entertaining train wreck."
"MJ was the exception because at that point there was no max contract or luxury tax collectively bargained. Jordan made like $4 Million up until 1996 when he had already won 3 titles. Since the Bulls had his Bird Rights, they were able to surpass the salary cap in order to sign Jordan. The contract they offered was 122% more than the entire Salary Cap for the 1998 season. [source](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/how-michael-jordans-salary-surpassed-nba-salary-cap-consecutive-seasons).   To prove my point a little more, $33 Million in 1998 is roughly equal to $50 Million in today’s dollars. There is a legitimate chance that within the next 3 years that is the average annual salary of super max contract. Some elite players in the very near future will be earning more than entire teams could spend to field a team in 1998 in terms of purchasing power.   Jordan is a GOAT-tier player, compared to his peers he is unquestionably the best player. Soon players of John Wall or Rudy Gobert are going make similar money as Jordan. (Not trying to downplay had great those players are, it’s just to point how more common that type of money will come in the NBA.) also, Jordan getting paid that much was absurd in 1998, pretty sure he alone made more that season then the Jazz team he played in the finals."
"Point stands, but doesn’t this actually belong to John Wall?"
"Dame, Kyrie, Kemba, John Wall"
Damn would've been a finals lock with Christian Wood and John Wall as the Houston big 3.
With the ball in his hand he’s not touching John wall
People downvoting you but lins draft combine numbers in the sprint is actually faster than John wall
"Devin Harris, John Wall, Tony Parker, Ish Smith, D Rose De’Aaron Fox  Wouldn’t be surprised if Kira Lewis makes that list soon"
John Wall went from shooting &lt;20% from three his first year to a passable shooter
The real Nets fans are the ones that show up to a Championship Parade expecting the Nets to still find a way to lose somehow. That’s why we try not to get ahead of ourselves.   How many of those hyperlinks are there with the “remember when the Nets were up double digits at halftime”. We’re dead inside at this point.   Nets fans know what it’s like to watch the team go 12-70 only to miss out on John Wall which kickstarts the D.Will and Billy King Era.   We pray to the Drowned God.   “What is dead may never die.”
John Wall was an absolute speed demon for the Wizards in the 2010's.  He would torch the Hawks best defenders on a regular basis.
John Wall
John Wall once ran the court with the ball *while* being bumped by a defender in something like 3.5 seconds.
A healthy John Wall
"Plenty of teams would love to have Rudy, even with his contract. FFS John Wall got traded."
"Missing max level players absolutely matters. It'd be a different story if  Harden and Kyrie were somehow replaced by like John Wall and De'Aron Fox, but it's Nets 8 and 9th men off the bench replacing a lot of those minutes. Joe Harris and Blake Griffin need to have outstanding games, cos otherwise KD and the Nets are outgunned."
"For real on the athletic slashers. John Wall is still an absolute cheat code. It's absurd how easily and how often he dunks, and how often he just ignores strong interior defenders while doing it. Sometimes he just feels unstoppable."
They’re not too bad at identifying talent on the fringes at least. I think they’re just sinking their efforts into player dev at this point. I’ll hold out on shitting on their FO til it’s time to handle the John Wall situation.
"I was a freshman at UK the same year as John Wall. One day after the season he was playing pick up games with students at some of the local courts I was at. Even though I had watched him play for UK from the front row all season, something about seeing him play against regular people really put into perspective the sheer ability of a real nba talent.   The speed that he moved at, the passes he threw, his handle. He looked like a different species than the other people on the court. 18 year old me walked away that day convinced he could end up the GOAT.   Incidentally, Randall Cobb(NFL WR) was there that day playing too and even he turned to my friends and me after a dunk Wall had and just shook his head and said “he’s unbelievable.”"
Porzingis is far from untradeable. John Wall got traded after not playing basketball for 18 months .  There’ll be some team that sees a young F/C that shoots with good defensive metrics before this season and think they can fix him.
They struggled against the 38-44 Nets in round 1 and the 46-36 Wizards almost beat them in round 2 without John Wall. That's why they were frauds
He’s a lot  closer to John wall than he is as a top 15 pg in the league
Jeff Teague wishes he was John Wall.  And I know exactly what I'm implying when I say that.
It’s impossible to have thought cp3 was a worse contract than John Wall.
"2017-2018 might’ve had more in all honesty, Gordon Hayward, cousins, IT, fultz, curry, cp3, John wall, kawhi, Kevin love, mills Ap, Conley, kyrie, klay Thompson.Those are the big names"
John Wall exists.
"Yes, don’t sell an nba team to a broke idiot. But if you do, don’t listen the mandate of said owner to trade a franchise player for 7 draft picks and John wall.  That would be a good start"
John Wall?
"In the words of John Wall  ""Fuck is wrong witchu, boi?!"""
"- D Rose - D Lillard - D Derozan - I Thomas - J Lin (while playing meaningful minutes) - Otherwise John Wall / CP3  Overall consummate professionals, they have some time urgency given age / tenure, have proven themselves in the league and are constantly and consistently underrated, may have had some poor injury luck, and by all available evidence, are great people off the court."
"It’s actually been done before, John Wall had his own security dude for the last couple of seasons with the Wiz. Here’s the [scuffle with Crowder](https://youtu.be/28DVNpwLREk) where Wall’s security guy is on the court with him. His security guy was mostly chillen on the bench but he was always quick to react if Wall was getting into something."
"Trae Young is great and all, but I don't know if I would trust my franchise to a guy so small in today's NBA unless he had some John Wall or AI type quickness"
One bad playoffs series and he’s John Wall smh.
"Ted Leonsis is a businessman. He just needs the Wizards to make him money. If he genuinely cared about them being a contending team, he wouldn't have let Ernie Grunfeld run down the franchise for as long as he did.  The team hasn't seen this much attention since John Wall was at his peak 4 years ago. And back then, we were at least a threat to make the conference finals, while right now we're an unceremonious first round exit. Beal has been loyal, but Westbrook gets eyes on the team. And that's what Ted seems to care the most about."
"Wow, I did not expect John Wall to be on that list. Guess it’s easy to forget greatness after it’s been gone for so long.  Fuck, now I gotta go watch some 2016 Wizards games"
2016-2017 John Wall
Agent 0 or John Wall maybe
"If I’m guarding giannis, I don’t adjust when he catches the ball anywhere on the perimeter. I would literally just shout ‘Shoot it!’ if I thought that would make it any more likely that Giannis would actually shoot. I would just shade my weak side defenders towards the paint a tiny bit to help in case Giannis drives, but not that much because Giannis’ primary defender will be playing six feet off him. I could be wrong but I haven’t seen Giannis make that fast cross court pass John Wall/Westbrook/Morant like to make so much..not sure he can. So, ball movement doesn’t dictate too much where my defense goes-no matter what, I tilt my defense towards whichever side of the court Giannis is not on.  But that’s just my theory, I don’t know if it would work or not."
Clips let's trade John wall for pbev straight up. Yall don't appreciate our boy enough
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"Bulls are trading: Lavine, White, Vuc for Ben Simmons 2 firsts and a swap. I'm not sure why that's the end of the world in a vacuum. I know why it won't happen, and maybe I'm lower on Vuc and Lavine than many but I would take that if I'm in charge of the Bulls. Lets you hit the reset button with a player locked up long term. Ben Simmons when Embiid is out is a different animal. Elite defense, 20 10 and 8 is totally possible. Somewhere in between giant westbrook and giant John Wall."
"I mean we get to the point where they start fading, you will 100% see dumb shit Dame is just John Wall with range takes"
"I always hear this as a possible solution but I never see it working out in actual practice.   Take the wizards for example. Bad team. Terrible team. Turrible. Been bad for soooooo long. Then they sign Arenas to his first deal and they catch lightning in a bottle for a brief moment. They are never a real contender but just moving to 500 after years of high lottery was a huge improvement. What do they do when Gilbert (who clearly wasn’t bringing them any further) deal was up? They can’t return to rebuild... but by giving Gilbert the “there is no max” they are handcuffing themselves to .500 ball for the length of the contract.   Finger guns, years more of being terrible, fast forward to John Wall. Again they aren’t doing anything great but they are at least not a laughing stock anymore. His rookie deal comes up they would surely want to “there is no max” contract him but that basically means they give up on resigning Beal before his window to sign contract 2 even opens.   Or... the worst case scenario, they don’t offer wall deciding instead to wait and sign Beal only for him to decide against resigning with the (terrible) team after wall has already walked."
"This exactly. Guys like Lebron and KD should not have ANYWHERE near the same contract as John Wall or Bradley Beal. No matter how you cut it, so long as players can make more money in endorsements than actual contracts, they will go to big markets.   You remove the Max contract, then teams will fork over half the cap to a star. Then you can finally get the big names dispersed throughout the league."
John wall has been injured a big part of 3 years? 43 mln contract and play option of 47 mln... damn.. even kp is not that scary
Not d rose he's a fucking ninja now. Fu ked the flying centurion bullshit I'm glad he got hurt young it looks like he still had time to reform is game. Good luck John wall trying to reinvent yourself like d rose. It takes 4 years.
A couple years ago I was at the Hawks-Wizards playoff game in Atlanta where John Wall had an insane coast-to-coast behind the back dunk and the vast majority of Phillips arena either let out a “woah” or clapped for him.
John Wall was elite in the playoffs
Is he still the same John Wall though. I didn’t catch any rockets games this year but is he the same kind of player he was when he carried the Wizards.
Reminds me of John Wall
"Current: John Wall   All time: along with Wall, Tracy McGrady, Hakeem Olajuwon, Chauncey Billups, Rajon Rondo and some more"
I think Celtics best bet would be John Wall if it was possible. He did some serious shot jacking in htown but he’s a premier playmaker and passer who can still play above average D if he wants to.
John Wall
That's less than John Wall
Fox is the new John Wall
"Yeah maybe, but they could’ve avoided that by trading him for more picks a la the thunder, also they traded for John wall for picks but that also got rid of Westbrook’s contract"
He has not shown any signs that he’ll ever recover his health or athleticism. He’s also like 5-11. Undersized guards who don’t play defense is not the formula for success. I would think Celtics fans would know that.  John Wall has at least shown signs of returning to form.  You can’t just look at his first year back on literally the worst team in the league.  I would take the upside on Wall over Kemba.
"It's unfair to judge Wall purely based on his performance this year though. He was coming off an achilles tear, on a completely new team, and he was playing great to start the season before the Rockets imploded. John is a pass first guy that was forced to take tough shots because he literally had nobody else on his team that could create anything on offense for long stretches during the season. And after a certain point, you could tell he didn't give a fuck anymore.   He'd be an awesome fit next to the jays. He showed this season that he is still a good defender when engaged, plus he could assume his natural distributor role again and let the Jays do the scoring.   Get him a competent P&amp;R big as well and you might see Wall surprise some people next year."
Remember John wall was the worst contract in the league and he got traded. And it took 1 lottery protected pick. CP3 was a bad contract before he got traded and so was Westbrook.  Granted these players are traded for each other but it's def possible.
John Wall
They blew a 22 pt lead in 7 minutes that was some elite level of tanking by john wall
How bad was John Wall?
Wouldn't you guys want John Wall on your team to be the tank commander...?
Knicks might need him to help the reanimated corpse of Derrick Rose (and John Wall would far better imo).   Not sure why the Mavs would move for Kemba.  KP on paper is what the Mavs need. He just hasn't delivered what was promised.
Actually John Wall is going to the Knicks (please)
"I get that but it doesn’t always apply you have some movies like godfather or players like Kareem that are timeless. When you have a freak of nature like Jordan (goodfellas) or something we’ve never seen before 1080HD (KD) you have to go back and reevaluate your opinion and say newer is better. I personally just have never seen a 3 level scorer this skilled and impactful. Kd has literally controlled who wins a championship for the last 5 years 3 with warriors open for everyone because he’s out and most likely another one this year. Kd also has never not been the best player on his team he wasn’t gifted red Auerbach he’s been the best player on his team since year 2. While kd was getting blown out figuring out the nba bird was in college honing his craft. Also have to consider in how much back problems cost his career. All together I take kd every time and it’s not really close. The argument could be made he was the best player on the court in 2012 finals. If you gave him any level headed less emotional point guard. John wall, cp, dame, or any all nba player who doesn’t take every possession personal like Westbrook the spurs probably never see a finals again and warriors never make a run he’s that good. Him and Kyrie are proving what kd would be if his point guard isn’t a complete dickhead."
Might as well add John Wall in there somewhere
"He made like specific challenges though. He challenged John Wall to be first team all defense, IT to win First Team All NBA and some other stuff. He did not literally or figuratively tell everyone to win MVP."
Isaiah Thomas first team all pro and John Wall first team all defense aren’t happening any time soon unfortunately. Who knows if DeRozan rekindled a friendship from Compton
John wall
"I think they’re asking about making a big superstar leap to MVP, not just like having the exact same career arc. Like, going from John Wall level to MVP level for instance. I think Ja is actually a pretty good answer"
"Are you dense lol? Youre proving my point that he did a bunch of challenges and some would stick and some wouldn’t. For example, Giannis and Jokic won MVP, so they completed their challenge. Isaiah Thomas, John wall, and Paul George didn’t complete their challenge. I don’t get why you’re so bent out of shape about this. Is Kobe your favorite player and I offended you by saying he did a bunch of **random** challenges?  &gt;	But it looks like you believe that for something to be successful it has to be 100% right,  I literally said some would stick, some wouldn’t. That literally means it won’t be 100% right. You just seem triggered by my use of the word “random”."
I literally provided an example of where the person didn’t meet the challenge and will never meet the challenge. There’s also one where he told PG to win DPOY and John Wall to make all nba first team defense. You’re the one crying here like I said some blasphemous shit. You’re taking this too personally. Grow up.
Lmao r u a rockets fan tryna pass John Wall to us
5-6 years ago Dame and John Wall was a debate
"John Wall in Washington, Chris Bosh and Toronto, pretty much any other also ran of a given era.  Daron Williams in Utah.  The classic good numbers bad team guy, good enough to be a face of a franchise but no team success. Generally followed up good regular seasons with playoff failure. And you know what, you could make an argument for Chris Paul or James harden. Not to say that these were bad players, but they generally were third fiddle to the main teams of the era ('90s bulls, 2000s Lakers and Spurs, early 2010 seats the Golden State era ) in the main finals matchup"
"Eh I’d prefer starting from 2014/15. You lose John Wall Brandon Knight and Cousins, but you gain KAT Devin Booker and Julius Randle"
John Wall
"Like 3rd row back, but close enough. The price was to good for me not to go.  Trust me, Wizards were super cheap back then, too - as John Wall and Bradley Beal hadn't made a name for themselves yet. Combine that with the Processing Sixers, and it made for game that nobody wanted to attend - except for me."
"oh, the discounts weren't just in philly. I got courtside seats for only 100 bucks in DC, and i got to watch john wall make gravy out of nerlens noel and jahlil okafor. it was awesome.  same against LAC at staples, I saw De'Andre Jordan dunk SEVEN times on those poor babies, and tickets were dirt cheap compared to everything else at Staples."
I mean it's Jrue Holiday. Not John Wall. So it's a fair contract
"That would only work if we had cap space  If we somehow magically trade for Lillard, we’d still have John Wall and his horrible contract"
"No one is trading for [2 year, $91 million](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/john-wall-6882/). The Rockets have to buy him out or attach assets."
He's a much more complete offensive player now than when he was playing second fiddle to John. It's a damn shame that we Wiz fans never got to watch prime Wall and Brad play together. Fuck injuries.
"He was never an MVP level talent. To compare to someone in the modern era, he was prime John Wall / Kyrie Irving level. Someone who was one of the best at their position but never an MVP candidate.   The fact he got so many assists was due to using the same move with Malone over and over for 15 years and being lucky that they both were healthy.  He frequently disappeared in the playoffs and got outplayed by worse point guards, similar to Dame nowadays. Lets not forget he was never the best player on his team either.  Ranking him over guys like Nash, Zeke, Kidd, Payton, Russ and CP3 is disrespectful to those guys who all were MVP level guys and lead their own teams."
He’s a Robin and will never be a Batman. Coming up in the league playing with A good John Wall has made him that
We only started hating and trolling on you guys since your fanbase started infiltrating our sub and BR community trying to say John Wall and Jalen Green would be enough to get Cade. Hell nah fam.
popular PGs have stans that can last years. Even bums like Jeremy Lin (the 2021 version) still have delusional stans defending him. People still believe in John Wall for some reason. Etc.  I for one shit on Lonzo immediately and I've been mostly proven right. For a #2 overall pick he's been very disappointing. Tatum was right there!
"Oh please, John Wall will sit like 60% of the year and get shut down at some point. We've seen it so many times by now."
"And just so we have the best arena music we should get John Wall, Tyler Herro, Mo Bamba and Halleluka!"
John Wall would have to get traded for him to be a 18-20 PPG guy in his rookie season
John Wall!
John Wall throwing up gang signs.
"And that's coming from a guy who would take Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson or John wall over Kyle Lowry. Absolutely garbage take. Basketball is more than regular season offence. What other PG in the last 50 years can be switched onto an all star 7 foot centre and make them pass the ball out instead of posting up? What other PG of this generation can take a charge, get a steal, hit a long range pull up 3, and run a pick and roll alley oop to perfection all in a 3 min span - and that's a normal night for him? Have you ever actually watched an NBA game before? My god."
"Steph, Westbrook, CP3, Kyrie, Lillard and Conley, I'll give you those. Rose, Kemba, John Wall and Reggie Jackson are not better. Put some more respect on Lowry's name. He's ringed up, he's getting a statue and his ass is much fatter. He has more career playoff wins, none of the other four have even made the finals (Jackson didn't play during the Thunder Finals run, I checked) and his career regular season stats crushes them too. If you want to ask what he's done lately, the Raptors had the second best record in the league in 2020, and his last game of 2021 had him put up 37 against the full strength Lakers. He's the greatest Raptors player ever."
"In other words, the Giannis Wall is the Greek/Hebrew version of John Wall."
"Yeah but when have you ever had to use a fricking lottery pick to move salary. These guys are being paid less than 20 mil, it’s not like a John Wall contract."
While guys like Russell Westbrook and James Harden and Dame Lillard and I want to say John Wall kept getting the bag every single year they could none won a championship. While Giannis is going to get the bag every chance he has now and will have a ring to show for it.
"Alright Piston Bros, John Wall was an all star, has a rap song/dance about him from like a decade ago and we aren't even asking for Jeremi Grant, what's not to like about this proposal?"
"Rockets fan coming in peace. Hey Piston Bros, y’all look spooky   Take John Wall and our 23rd pick for 1st pick"
"Who would be in front of him? He's better than CP3, imo. John Wall is a good guard defender when healthy, but I wouldn't put him on Jrues level.   I might be a bit biased but if we're talking strictly guards, the only person I can think of is Klay. When healthy of course."
"Christian Wood, John Wall, KPJ"
"Yeah I agree it's unlikely to happen. but thanks for finding a reference. So only 20% has to be base. I mean, the All-Star one is a good example. John Wall obviously wouldn't be considered likely. Lots of players are on that All-Star bubble that teams might be happy to juice their deals with incentives like that-- if your 15M or 20M guy becomes a 25M guy if they're a lock for All-Star, no problem. Imagine.. Lonzo or John Collins or Colin Sexton or Wiggins or lots of players like that."
"If Dominique Wilkins, LeBron, Vince Carter and Jordan are tier 1.  Then Kobe is in that next tier below that. I think John Wall without the crazy speed."
"John Wall is ass too. People see KD and don’t realize that he’s the exception, not the rule."
It is relative to their usage (31.7 vs 22.5) and given the fact John wall is primary ball handler/scorer so he forces more shots. I like cp3 but 2019 was an atrocity. I watched every game that season and it was heartbreaking watching him regress
Dude was legit as bad as John wall is now and he’s a cap space black hole. It was so sad to watch our championship window end even with hardens mvp caliber season
John Wall has some nice tricks in his bag but it always **felt** like 90% of his assists were off drive and kicks
 JOHN WALL FOR KEVIN LOVE
My point is that the team guarantees the money whether the player turns out like Dame Lillard or John Wall. So in reciprocation for that guaranteed  money the player should buy in to the team whether the team turns out like the Warriors or the the Blazers. At least while they're under contract.
"Paul George signed with OKC.   &gt;Yes theres always stars who get drafted by small markets and sometimes are able to retain them,  Isn't retaining stars you drafted what we're talking about?   Small markets that show they can be competent and compete for championships have been able to do that.   All this complaining is bullshit because a lot of these small market teams don't respect the stars that do stay...theyre quick to ship them out as soon as they get hurt or start to age. Guys like John Wall, and Westbrook stayed dedicated to their teams and when the started to decline the orgs shipped them out."
So many times big stars with contracts were rules untradeable and were still traded. John Wall and CP3 come to mind.
"OK I think i figured out JW stands for John Wall, but does DC stand for Washington, D.C.? Or DeMarcus Cousins? In the next sentence you called him Boogie so I cant know for sure. Or maybe Daniel Cormier? Im obviously not up to date on all of todays abbreviations, please help"
"In the final season they surrounded Harden with John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, and Christian Wood. They were telling Harden that the window was closed"
"If a player gets injured the team still has to pay the player. Or would you be ok with injury clauses and non-guaranteed contracts?   In the contract the team assumes the risk that the player will get injured, is unable to play, or cannot play up to a certain standard. John wall may never be a superstar again, but he’s going to get paid like it for the next several years.   The player in return guarantees that they will play for the person that holds their contract rights."
"Lol a 2018 all-star? You mean like Lamarcus Aldridge, Victor Oladipo, Al Horford, John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Love? How is being a 2018 all-star relevant at this point?"
"Not really comparable.   Even when players get traded the teams are still upholding their end of the contract.   Imagine an NBA where teams could decide they don't want to pay the full salary agreed to, that would be comparable.      * Was Harden happy playing for Houston? - No but he still has his end of the contract to uphold.  * Is Houston happy paying John Wall? - No but they will still uphold their end of the contract   That's the difference.    Teams are upholding their ends of the contract by ensuring these players get paid the full amount they are owed. Players aren't upholding their end of the contract when they refuse to perform at a reasonable level.  Imagine if a plumber came to your house, did half the work and expected 100% of the money. That's the current state of the NBA."
"&gt; But, to be fair, the teams are PAYING the players  And this is the big thing.  The contract is:   * Player plays basketball * Team pays money  We don't ever see teams saying ""we don't like you anymore therefore we won't pay you as much"" but we do see players saying ""I don't like you anymore therefore I won't play as hard"".   It's one thing for players to have agency, but it's another for them to intentionally tank the value of their contracts.    &gt;Is Dame wrong for wanting to move on? Not at all - but a contract is a contract, and I think it completely defeats the purpose of Bird Rights if we just get into a trend of sign-max-then-demand-trade.  Yeah absolutely.   Dame hasn't done it yet, but we've seen plenty of players refuse outright to finish out their contract. Harden, Kawhi, Kyrie, etc.  They all refused to play at the level they were being paid to play at.  Imagine the outrage if Houston just said ""we're only going to pay John Wall 20m/y now instead of the 45-50m he's owed because we don't like this arrangement anymore"".   ***  If players want more freedom of movement they should sign shorter contracts.   LeBron and KD get a lot of shit for team hopping but to their credit that's what they did."
"idk. I think Boogie spoke out of turn because Harden had requested a trade before they have even acquired Boogie.   Like Boogie was there for all of 2 weeks before he inserted himself into an ongoing situation that ostensibly had little to do with him. Harden wasn’t about to drop his trade request cause of John Wall and Boogie Cousins — both are washed out, and neither improved their chances of winning. Boogie should’ve read the the tea leaves imo.   I understand Boogie wants to compete, but it’s ironic that he’d openly make an enemy out of the only person that made that team competitive in the first place. That’s my point.   Boogie ain’t moving no needle, he ain’t no franchise player, he was a 2 week rental at that point that was taking shots at the guy that had been there for the last decade. The situation was more complex than Boogie portrayed it to be when it really wasn’t his place to speak up on it anyway."
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
It’s still crazy to me people actually tried to convince themselves back-from-injury  John wall and demarcus ducking cousins would’ve helped turn the rockets fortune around.
LOOOOL  I was out here watching John Wall Summer hoop highlights and looking at Boogies Warriors stats on Basketballreference.   We were no longer clinging on hope but for life itself
"&gt; We have more than enough to match all the packages that superstars have gotten lately  The entire issue is there are no superstars to be had.  *Maybe* Beal is available.  He's not really a superstar, and while he's an upgrade from CJ, does going from CJ to Beal really make much of a difference?  Lillard is already the primary scorer, and as an off-ball sidekick, CJ is actually a better shooter.  Either way that's not gonna move the needle enough to seriously contend.  They could swing for a one year rental on Lavine, but again, does Lavine over CJ as a secondary option even move the needle enough?  Beyond that, it's all maneuvers with warts.  Porzingis, Simmons, John Wall, etc.  I don't think that guy is out there."
It's possible Klay Thompson is the worst contract in the league. Like John wall level bad.
John Wall in Portland? Dreams do come true.
"Yup, finally a sliver of light in the darkness.  Beal has just turned himself into too good of a player to have the John Wall career, where he never plays on a relevant team.    I've also noticed that reporters have *slightly* changed their tone from ""they immediately hang up and block the number"" to ""well *maybe* if they were blown away with a godfather offer they might take the call.""    I suspect that Ted realized Russ puts even more butts in seats and is probably enough to get to the play-in, which could be renamed ""Ted's Target."""
John Wall would be 20% better as a player if he went by Hildred Wall.
Well who else can they get that they'd want? John Wall? Russell Westbrook? No lol.
Yeah but for John Wall and two late firsts? You'd say no to Lillard?
"John Wall, 23, and 24 for Dame who says no"
"You're not gonna find a day 1 playoff level playmaker in the draft, even Cade is gonna have some down nights because he can't turn the corner reliably against NBA level guys and NBA game speed always takes adjustment. You need a guy with more league experience to fill that specific hole meanwhile you can draft good shooters and they have a better track record impacting teams day 1  I'd be crossing my fingers the Knicks FO could outbid Sexton's dirt cheap offers. Despite the hit pieces Kevin Love gave anonymous quotes for, Sexton had a good assist rate for a guard this past year. Not quite floor general level, but he's at the very least in that John Wall/Derrick Rose slash and kick mold. That or Ricky Rubio would be a good Thibs PG too."
Does Jrue not take righty layups? Is he like John Wall where he only finishes with his off hand?
"If I’m the Sixers I’m staying as far away from John Wall and Kemba as I can. Don’t want to pair an overpaid, aging, and injury prone guard with my already injury prone center."
Thinking about it now...maybe the rockets? John wall for ben simmons trade scenario? Rockets get another young piece to pair with christian woods while john wall and joel embid isn't the worst thing to happen. Real question is do sixers fans even wanna do that trade???
That's John Wall music
JOHN WALL
"Depending on what we do with the 14th pick, we can select a really promising player like Ziaire or Giddey for their ceiling. If we do select a low ceiling high floor player, then yeah, it's a cheap young roleplayer.  I'm fairly certain Wise will be a starting level C by next year and only go up from there.  Wiggins isn't an albatross of a contract to me. Albatrosses are KP, K-Love, Horford, John Wall, ect. Wiggins was pretty neutral in terms of contract for us, you could argue a negative, I certainly wouldn't say an albatross.  We are NOT trading the 7th to trade Wiggins. We're saving him for next year when he has 1 year on his contract. A 1 year contract can rarely ever be an albatross, it's when he might actually be traded for a star player. Unlike what the uneducated morons on this sub think, we aren't trading Wiggins, Wiseman, every pick to ever exist, Poole and every asset we have for a player like Beal this year. Don't expect it unless we get really lucky with a deal. The time for that is next offseason."
Jaylen Brown and Celtics. Gauranteed ring. John Wall and the Rockets. Easily a ring
"To trade for Wall the Clippers would have to send Kennard, Beverley, Rondo and Yogi Ferrell just to make the salaries match. And with Reggie Jackson likely to leave in free agency that would leave Wall as the only point guard on the Clippers roster. With Kawhi and Ibaka both likely to miss all of next season and with Batum also likely to leave in free agency, that also would mean that the only players the Clippers would have for next year would be PG, Wall, Morris, Mann and Zubac, with Daniel Oturu being the only guy off the bench. They'd still be over the cap, so no way to sign any free agents (other than with the taxpayer MLE of $5 million and vet minimums). They do own their own pick this year (25th), but that's the only pick they have in the draft.   TL;DR - I think it's highly unlikely they trade for John Wall."
"I really doubt they'll win a chip with Kawhi coming back that late into the season, and I don't think they'll win with either their current roster or the only major addition being 2022 John Wall. In my personal opinion, their window is closed."
HOW YOU GON BEAT JOHN WALL. YOU GONE 2ND ROUND. IMMA CALL YOU 2ND ROUND. BYE 2ND ROUND
Wood on a even better deal and John Wall gone? Sign me up!
Thunder for Kemba or rockets for John Wall
I don't care what anyone says... John wall is better than KPJ any day of the week. I get the hate though...he is overpaid veteran while KPJ is a young guy on a rookie deal. But if you wanna compare actual ball skills John Wall by a mile
"don't let john ""piru"" wall catch you talkin about him in this manner"
"Beal doesn't really play off-ball with Russ - they're much more of a my-turn-your-turn.    Beal took a leap when Wall first got injured in 2017, in part b/c he had to start playing a lot more with the ball in his hands.  (The smartest thing Scott Brooks did in 5 years was force-feed Beal PG possessions - it was f'ing brutal to watch at the time, but it was a lost season, so he was forcing him to develop the skill in games).    Beal was 'in the wilderness' for too long btw Wall &amp; Westbrook, w/ Tim Frazier, young Sato, and Ish Smith as his PGs, so he had to learn to fend for himself.    Over the last two years, 38% of LaVine's 2P shots have been assisted - 40% for Beal.    Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tries, Beal cannot f'ing shoot off-the-dribble 3s, so a lot more of his 3s are assisted than LaVine's.    Watching Beal in the Nigeria game was almost embarrassing - the guy had genuinely forgotten how to play off ball.  He looked just like John Wall when Beal first started getting some initiator possessions - standing on the wing, trying to figure out when to cut, and looking like a teenage driver trying to figure out how to merge in rush-hour traffic."
John Wall?
No they need John Wall to carry them to the WCF
"I could see that, assuming you can find a tanking team with a good player. Beal (if the wizards decide to call it) and John Wall come to mind first"
"Hornets would have John wall , Zion , curry brothers , Ingram , Paul"
"Simmons for John Wall, who says no?"
"Assuming dame is off the table, who's available? Dlo, Lowry, John Wall maybe, kemba, drose maybe, buddy hield"
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all.

"As a Wizards who watched Rockets games, I can say that John Wall did not look good this year. His efficiency fell off a cliff and his knees look so bad that I think he might need to have extra surgery during the off-season"
If John wall wants to go to another team dudes gotta get bought out and play at a discount
"Hopefully Mobley or Green, or Garland and a combination of other players. We'll find it. He isn't the end all be all and we can find some scoring in better ways. The backcourt is too small regardless. We aren't going to be there next year, but we can't follow the Sexton train. Gotta make the right moves for the future now. Dame/CJ or John Wall/ Bradley Beal didn't even work all that well at their peak and we want a shittier version."
John Wall and picks for Ben Simmons  Who says no?
john wall is available!
I don’t see an Even trade happening at all. Yes he’s young but if there's no jumper than he really doesn't have much going for him other than his side. The best they could get would be like a John wall or Westbrook rn and that's the best they can get
"Apparently they're only allowed to give reggie jackson so much money since they don't have his bird rights and don't have space.  trading for john wall has no effect on jackson's situation, really, don't understand OP's logic there.  if he wants the bag he has to go somewhere else because clippers aren't allowed to give him it."
Or gang sign John Wall
LOL their roster would just be decimated. John Wall is not that much of a big upgrade but i guess.
John wall dead ass owed 44 million next year
"The first time I drove through Stockton, CA, I saw a dude pissing on the brick side of a building as he walked by it. Facing forward, dick aimed to the side. That's all you need to know about Stockton.  I didn't realize it at the time, but that was his john wall.  And a good image for Wall's contract. Clippers, in the words of Palpatine: ""Dew it!"""
"What it actually needs is 2015 John Wall - the guy who swept the Raptors, was a terror on defense, and averaged 13 assists in the playoffs.    Right up until he broke his hand."
Can we get John Wall on this team to up the trade value?
I just miss John Wall before the injuries.
"As someone who dislikes the Clippers, I too would be all in favor of them trading four players to get John Wall, especially when three of those players are point guards 😂"
You can add John wall to this list
Also PG  [Paul George on John Wall: 'He's a Brother to Me'](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/paul-george-on-john-wall-hes-a-brother-to-me)

John Wall is definitely nowhere close to worth that much
"Is it? I’ve seen somebody call the rockets john wall wood and kpj a big 3, it’s not too early it’s too late."
Washington Bullets - John Wall
What is John Walls future?  If he plays like last year does someone buy out that massive contract eventually?    I watched the Timberwolves score 20 straight points because of Wall.  He turned the ball over or missed a shot like ten plays in a row while playing no defense.
Pre-injury John Wall was always satisfying to watch. He has a very fluid style both with the ball and his movement on the court.  Also Lonzo. Easily one of the most creative passers in the league and he's always dead on target except when he's shooting.
"By that logic Demarcus Cousins, Kevin Love, Gilbert Arenas, John Wall weren’t superstars either.   Btw PG didn’t have just a good regular season, he had an MVP level regular season which a lot of superstars have not done.  Btw against Portland in the playoffs he averaged 28/7/4 splits with great defence. Those are superstar numbers lol"
"Surprised no one is mentioning John Wall. People forget but he was considered to be one of the best college prospects since Derrick Rose at Memphis, only 3 years but that includes a lot of talent."
Shouldn't John Wall be a urinal?
John wall is made of bricks that's just poetry.
Ok and? That doesn’t mean Russ is the best player on the team it just means they added a talented player for nothing(John wall who didn’t even play the year before). Brad was obviously the best player on that team the entire year stop the cap.
/r/nba crowdfunding solid artists to do the same thing but actually aesthetically pleasing and beautiful.  like john wall but he's got like a superpower that turns him into a wall of moving bricks.
the john wall one actually looks sick
"""all in all it's just another brick for John Wall"""
I miss the old John Wall
"Yeah, needs to pull more from Westbrook/new Drose and less from John Wall/old Drose"
So like I only watched one rockets game this year but I swear John Wall did a 360 layup in it.  Any Rockets fans remember?
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
"Not that surprising, Bradley Beal has played most of his career without injury, Wall has missed entire seasons and spends significant time getting back to form.  When he's healthy, John wall is nasty with blocks."
John Wall and Bradley Beal
Damn John Wall was quite an athletic specimen.
Yes they were. John Wall was the 2nd best player in the East in 2017. Stop the revisionist history. Only little kids thought Kyrie was better than those guys
"Derrick White   John Wall   Malik Monk  Manu Ginobili   Tim Duncan   Super small ball I guess lmfao, ima Kentucky fan hence Monk and Wall"
"He just put up an efficient 32 a game this season. That atleast warrants a 91-92, he literally has had the same rating since John wall was playing. You could say luka “doesn’t have the shooting or athleticism” to warrant a crazy rating either and he’s a 94."
Jabari Parker  Current John Wall
John Wall does NOT deserves to be in the same category with Boogie and Knight
Peak John wall was one of the my favorite players. Easily top 10 most exciting players in league history easily. He just needed to figure out that jumper. It’s a shame injuries hampered him
John wall
"There’s literally John Wall who had two major ones and missed about the same amount of time . He clearly didn’t lose his speed.   Basically : one guy remained a star, about 4-5 others were productive. The one who washed out is a 300 lb center.  The guys that did best; KD, Wes, Gay all can shoot. The guys who did worse; Cousins, Rose for a number of years couldn’t. When Rose improved , he had improved his skill level and touch to live without blowing by people.  Skill translates"
john wall
"I got in to the NBA when I wa a kid and Jordan had the bulls on the huge run in the mid 90s. I basically watched to see what incredible things he would do that night. I lost interest after that until my Kentucky Wildcats hired John Calapari. Since then I have loved watching all the former Cats play in the league. Wall, Cousins, Davis, Murray, Booker, Karl Towns and the rest put on a show nightly in the league. Instead of just watching one team I have a vested interest in the entire league now."
Isaiah Thomas was ranked ahead of Kyrie in 2017 easily bro.  John Wall was too
My guess is John Wall who missed 3 seasons pretty much.
"Wall is a huge negative asset, and boogie and knight have literally zero trade value. Basically it’s either trade away your 3 best players and have to pay John wall 2 years 91 mil, or keep your 3 best players and pay 5 years 225 mil. Most teams would keep their 3 best players, literally any team without their 3 best players is immediately the worst team in the nba."
"Above average on defense while I think he can prolly match his offensive stats of 2017-19 pd...20 on 40% from 3...looking at how John wall and KD has comeback recently from Achilles injuries,Klays playstyle makes me think he can get to a closer to max level like KD rather than Wall whose primary asset was his athletic ability"
It's already over Kawhi will be next john wall  after this injury
"Jesus what a horrible list.   1.lebron James  2. Dwight Howard   3. Yao Ming  4. Derrick rose  5. Anthony Davis  6. Kyrie Irving  7. John wall  8. Blake Griffin  9. Deandre Ayton   10. KAT or Zion   I suspect both edwards, Zion and Austin to be much higher on this list in a few years."
"I don't think anyone is sleeping on the Hornets, but I think they'll be as good as the 6th seed, floor is 9th. Graham being gone might actually help them not have a log jam at guard, but I looked him on this team.  I think the Rockets and Pacers are good sleepers.  I really like the players the Rockets have like Christian Wood, John Wall, Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr among others, and their head coach.  I don't like how the roster had played over the last few seasons for the Pacers, but Rick Carlisle is a big reason why I think they could surprise people.   I want to say the Magic so bad, but Jonathan Isaac will be out a lot of the season, but Fultz is coming back with Cole and Suggs. They still have Ross and MCW off the bench too, but I know nothing about Jamahl Mosley"
1. LeBron  2. AD   3. Dwight   4. Yao   5. Kyrie   6. Blake   7. DRose   8. KAT   9. John Wall   10. Simmons
"The type of players that don't get protected in expansion drafts are usually the guys you wouldn't really want, that's why expansion teams stink when they first begin.  So like, John Wall isn't the worst player in the world, but you wouldn't particularly want him on your team with his contract right now either."
"&gt; I figured they would go the route that KD took and have him take off closer to a year and a half off t  Its too hard to do this with players who want to get back when there's no real actual evidence having 12 vs 18 months meaningfully changes the recovery process. Oh ""KD looked great"", well guess what John Wall still looked terrible nowhere near what he was having more time off. The burden of proof to actually responsibly say 6 extra months of recovery is enough of a boost to be worthwhile tends to be alot higher than is presumed."
1. LeBron James  2. Dwight Howard  3. Anthony Davis  4. Kyrie Irving  5. Derrick Rose  6. Blake Griffin  7. Yao Ming  8. John Wall  9. Zion Williamson  10. Karl Anthony Towns
LeBron James  Dwight Howard  Anthony Davis  Derrick Rose  Kyrie Irving  Blake Griffin  John wall  Yao Ming  Karl Anthony Towns  Zion Williamson
It’d be really interesting to see the dynamics with stars on big contracts like KP or John Wall
"Spida and Zach aren't really interchangable, they have different gamestyle IMO.  Anyway I find it hard to find a good comparing for DJ tbh. Let's say he reminds me of John Wall and Ja Morant, but not as comparison, just gamestyle."
Nice of them to assume John Wall declines his $47 million player option.
Guard: Curry + John Wall  Forward: KD + Draymond   Center: I can’t do any better than the Jokic + Gobert answer
"The most blocks per game John Wall had in a season was 1.1,    Wade had 1.1 or higher 6 times."
"As a fan of the Wizards since the bullets days I really want to see a championship in my lifetime. I suffered through the days when we hung our hopes on Chris Webber as our franchise super star. Just non-stop disappointment since then going from Webber to Caron Butler —Jamison-Arenas-Blatche-Nick Young-John wall.  After John Wall and Gilbert’s contracts crippled our teams chances at a championship  Ive been wary of having a non-transformative players be awarded to the keys to the franchise. I think a Beal super max is just another trip to John Wall, Gilbert Arenas, Webber purgatory."
"John Wall was a solid all-star for a while. but also the game changed since 2016, you can't have your PG be a 30% 3PT shooter"
"It’s not just about Fox’s performance. I like him a lot. Underrated for sure. I’m more worried that he is more John Wall than Chris Paul. If that makes much sense. Fox is going to get his buckets, but can he elevate a team? Could just be the Kings stink. I’d just like to see him playing somewhere else. See if he can do more."
"John Wall was extremely good, arguably the best point guard in the east and put up amazing stats the last two times he made the playoffs."
I heard some guy did analysis and found the average #1 overall pick is John Wall
"Ah yes, the John Wall effect"
John Wall would like to have a word
"The East has never been weak at the PG position, what kind of bullshit is this?  Kyle Lowry  Kemba Walker  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Isaiah Thomas  Trae Young  Ben Simmons  These guys have all been All NBA caliber PGs at some point in recent memory despite playing in the east."
I feel like people ignore spacing. Joel dropped 30+ a night on us in the playoffs while we had Clint on him with John legitimately being told to ignore Ben in the paint. Now ask yourself this if Giannis had a problem when the raptors/heat built a wall by leaving Bledsoe open who can atleast kinda shoot imagine if he had a dude in the paint completely jacking up the spacing by sitting in the dunkers spot. There is a reason the bucks only put people that are a shooting threat around giannis. To be clear giannis would still be good I don’t doubt it but I think we can all acknowledge Joel is similarly as unstoppable in a much more difficult situation.
Yeah and Westbrook is worth John Wall and a 1st
John wall was a very good number 1 pick tho.
"To use an example, I'd be satisfied with Blake Griffin or John Wall with #1 picks. But the average value of the first pick is probably lower, like a Jrue Holiday, but I wouldn't happy with that at all."
"Blasphemy! We have Westbrook, John Wall, Dame, Harden..."
"I mean ... they traded Russ for John Wall in an obvious Hail Mary on the off chance John Wall looked amazing, and took back a FRP to hedge.  Like you said the return likely would've been pretty comparable if they traded him in the pre-season.  John Wall looked okay early but not good enough to justify HOU or Harden proceeding with it, so he did what he had to do and they dealt him.  It wasn't an AD-type situation at all imo"
"Klay is a HoF player and one of the best 3+D in NBA history. He's far better than a typical #1 overall pick. Trae and Tatum are also beyond expectation.   I'd lean towards someone like John Wall as a baseline expectation. Some All-Star appearances. Can probably get you into the playoffs with some help. Kenyon Martin is another guy in that range.  You're not always going to get a HoF type in the #1 slot. Not all years are that heavy at the top, and the draft is an imperfect science."
"Yeah they were trying to sell him on Boogie and John Wall as a contender. He had to get down and dirty and that's exactly what he did. Those LA games were embarrassing and should never have come down to that. Harden basically saying like show me anything and the team freaking couldn't. Those were dark, dark weeks as a Rockets fan."
"The John Squad isn’t bad, John Havlicek, John Stockton, John Wall, John Starks, John Collins. Just missing a center and they’d be great."
"John  Stockton, Wall, Havlicek, Collins, Issac"
John Wall: chase down blocks. Really the only thing though.
"30 teams in the NBA have max player slots, but there are fewer than 30 max level players in the league. Although to be fair, John Wall was definitely at that level at one point of his career."
"I think any random top 25 team is off.  And maybe not even the best teams some years could pull it off.  But I do believe some of the best college teams in history can definitely pull off some wins given 82 tries.  2018 Villanova I think has a shot.  They had Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divencenzo, Omari Spellman and Eric Pashcall who all made the NBA.  Phil Booth was in the G-League and Colin Gillespie was an all-American who will probably make the G-League or a European League after he 'graduates' next year.  Jermain Samuels might also go pro after he graduates next year as well.  That roster has 5 NBA players and 8 pros.  They were really good.  &amp;#x200B;  The 2010 Kentucky team was also really stacked.  They didn't win the title, but had John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, Daniel Orton, Patrick Patterson, Deandre Liggins and Darius Miller.  7 NBA players.  There are also a couple UNC and Duke rosters as well as Michigan's Fab Five.  Some of these teams I think can do much better than 1 win too.  Wouldn't be surpised if that Kentucky team could get at least 5."
Joe Johnson clutch shooting   Regiee Evans rebounding   John wall speed while dribbling
I still can not believe that john wall is making steph curry money
John wall - hof speed
You can have 3 Masais for the price of one John Wall
it does. see how bradley beal’s numbers went to the moon when john wall got out the way? if tatum wasnt there jaylen would be the guy and could definitely put up a 27 or 28 ppg season. he’s that good. “near 30ppg”
"&gt; Funnily enough it was meant to be December 23rd but because Harden broke covid protocol the game had to be postponed.  Not just Harden.  Three players either tested positive or inconclusive for COVID and 4 other players were already quarantined.  I think John Wall was quarantined because he went to get a haircut or something like that.  Ben McLemore was part of that group too.  &gt; If the Nets trade was the only one, then that would be fair but Harden had also been considering Miami, the 76ers and apparently the Bucks (though I find that unlikely since Bucks never had the assets to make that trade).  Realistically he wanted to be traded to the Nets and that's it.  Those other teams were used for leverage at best but pretty much everything points to Harden wanting to go to Brooklyn.  In the article I linked, they talk about how he and KD celebrated together before the trade happened (like November 17th-ish) because they came to a verbal agreement with the Nets about the trade."
BIG if but if John Wall can not be a massive tank commander I don’t think they’ll be the worst team
"&gt;myself that I couldn’t bring a championship there because that’s what I put the jersey on for every single game. But the community work really lets me see the impact I can have on the city. We’ve been through some tough times with \[Hurricane Harvey\] and all types of things. And just being able to come back now and be there for people and support them, I’m going to do that as long as I can.  As a lifelong rockets fan, I'm glad he did it. We were in for a season of mediocrity and I would've hated to see Harden waste a year of his prime trying to win with John Wall and Eric Gordon. It just wasn't going to happen. Real happy about our rebuild and hoping Harden can get his ring in Brooklyn."
"I don’t think you’d win a game with a random top 25 NCAA team. Those teams have maybe a couple NBA level talents but depth pieces on college squads would have no chance against NBA players. Also, in this scenario, your team is also playing a regular 82 game season. Take UCLA last year. Ended up a top 10 team, only one guy playing key minutes was over 6’8. Their best player in the tourney run, Juzang, couldn’t get a first round valuation because he’s a defensive liability on the wings. You can poke similar holes in pretty much any NCAA squad.   The Rockets were the worst team in the league last year, but Christian Wood, John Wall, KPJ, Olynyk etc. is soooo much better than a college team. 20-21 Rockets would easily win the NCAA title."
"I wouldn't say better.   Kyrie, Steph, Chris Paul, Lillard, up until recently John Wall  They're all under 6'5. Wouldn't you say they're the most skilled players right now?"
John Wall was a beast in the playoffs. Had a whole new gear and was clutch as fuck
Y’all are gonna replicate the team basketball of the 13-14 Spurs and channel it to the tank?!!  My GAWD. John Wall has met his match
"I could have phrased that better. My main point is that neither of them are all that special as scorers relative to the league. FVV is a better scorer than Smart but he isn’t a good scorer. By saying it’s not so large a gap, I mean that FVV isn’t far enough ahead of Smart as a scorer for his scoring to move the needle much.  If FVV had slightly below average efficiency, it would be one thing. But it’s bad enough, and has historically been bad enough except for brief periods of time, that his value as a volume scorer is pretty low because there are tons of players on at least as high volume who are actually efficient. When a player has such low efficiency, you want other players to be taking those shots and the player in question to bring value in other ways.  FVV’s never had a season with above league average ts%, not even the years he averaged 2.9, 8.6, and 11 ppg. He averaged 19.6 ppg this year. Of 53 players who averaged at least 19 ppg last year, only Westbrook, Anthony Edwards, John Wall, and Caris LeVert were as inefficient. So if a team is looking for a scorer, there’s at least 49 players out there who would be a better fit for the role and way more than that if you lower the ppg requirement just a point or 2."
Lol who’s your tank commander?  They will all tremble before John Wall. Dude can command the tank in his sleep
"John Wall, definitely  Eric Gordon still looks quick especially when driving to the rim."
I think John Wall and Eric Gordon have lost a step.
"Not just averaged the triple double, he's the franchise leader in them already.   I'm not saying he's an alltime great. But watch the video of Beal talk about his best teammates ever. After John wall it goes to gortat and Nene."
Id agree. The only thing is that teams make stupid choices. The CBA is there to protect the teams from giving john wall 500 m usd for 5 years
"2021-22 Chinese Basketball Association Dream Team    PG Isiah Thomas    SG Dennis Schroder    SF Joe Harris    PF Ben Simmons    Center Rudy Gobert     Bench: Bradon Knight, John Wall, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
"But it’s not only the quality of players that factors in.  For instance, the Rockets might leave John Wall unprotected because of his contract, even though he’s obviously one of the top eight players on the team. The expansion team might draft him because he’s still good, and they’re obviously not going to be signing any big time free agents that’ll take up cap space soon. Also, having a bankable star, or at least a big name, is a real asset when a team is trying to get fans in a new market."
Lol I hope so too.   I wanna see KPJ and Green not John Wall and Gordon lol
"[Here's the list of past Summer League MVPs.](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/summer/1/NBA-Summer-League/0/awards)  Of the first-year players who have won it (goes back to 2006), it's just Randy Foye, Jerryd Bayless, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Damian Lillard, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Clark, and now Davion Mitchell and Cam Thomas. Interesting list of players."

"Yep. By contrast on first picks overall win shares:  48, 20.8, 65.9, 242, 138.2, 50.6, 18.9, 7.3, 42.8, 77.2, 44.1  So, if the first pick gets you a 50% chance of getting: Lebron, Blake Griffin, John wall, Derrick rose, Dwight Howard, or Yao Ming   That’s a better than 50% chance at an all NBA player. The two biggest busts are Bargaini and Oden."
"I am not saying that John Wall didn't work hard, he had to be talented and work hard to be noticed and to take advantage of that opportunity. And yes, most situations boil down to luck. You can work extremely hard, even harder than anyone else and still you may not get the opportunity because you weren't in the right place at the right time. The world isn't entirely merit-based, and many small lucky moments can bring you either to the top or it can derail your life. Look at Tom Brady, he is an extremely hard worker, if Bledsoe doesn't get hurt it is very likely that he ends up being a career backup or being cut. Even more lucky is that he had a coach like Belichick. If Tom Brady gets drafted by like the Browns he more than likely doesn't become Tom Brady because he never gets the chance to fully prove himself. Life if luck, working hard is so that when luck favors you you can take advantage of the situation. You can only control what you can control and you have to hope that everything you've done gives you an opportunity to succeed"
"I never said John Wall had it easy, I have no idea where you got that from. What turned John Wall around was his high school coach who mentored him at Word of God after he got cut from a different school's team. If John Wall doesn't meet Coach Beckwith he likely never gets to that camp and may even be in a worse situation. My point is that not everyone will get someone who is willing to take them aside and mentor them or give them the opportunities. When I mean investment of resources that's what I mean, support from the community, support from a person who believes in you, not everyone gets that"
John Wall grew up with a single mother who worked multiple jobs. His father died when he was 9 of cancer and he was also a convicted armed robber. John Wall never had it easy.   Your point makes no sense and is completely wrong
"Kevin Love, Steven Adams? Al Horford? John Wall?"
"What was the best team lebron beat to get to the finals when he was In The East all those years? The Roy Hibbett Paul George Pacers? Jordan beat Ewing and starks, Miller, price and Daugherty, Thomas and dumars, hardaway and O’Neal, Barkley (when he was still  in philly), Wilkins, Bird, mchale and parish (old, but still playing).    Lebron beat Kyle Lowry and senator derozan over and over and over.  Oh, and John wall and Bradley Beal.   Who did Jordan beat in the finals? Malone, stockton, Barkley, magic, Payton, and Drexler.    I give lebron credit for beating the Spurs with Duncan, Ginobli, and Parker (popovich is the best coach either Jordan or lebron faced.  So I give him major kudos for beating him), and the warriors with klay, steph and draymond.  But his lost to mavs is inexcusable and cannot be ignored when comparing him with someone who went 6-0 in finals series.  How do you ignore that and his 3-6 record in finals series? Aside from his first run with the cavs against the Spurs where he had no shot to win (I don’t hold this against him) he played with 2 other hall of famers in all of his other finals series and his record is under 500.  What measure do you want to use to figure this out? Jordan has him beat with everything! Jordan’s peaks was higher than lebron, it just is.  Lebron has played damn near 50% more games than jordan and thus has amassed an incredible resume. But it’s just not as good as Jordans"
John Wall
Please read my comment again. Wall did not ask out his agent posted a PUBLIC trade request to gain leverage after it leaked he was being shopped less than one week after the GM Tommy Sheppard publicly stated John Wall was not going to be traded in a 15 minute interview talking about building around Beal and Wall. This is not a trade demand as you originally stated.
No they need John Wall (pls)
A few interesting names pop up if you change the minimum attempts to 140:      Seth Curry    144     48.6     (ninth best) -----------------------------     John Wall     145     31.7     (worst overall)     Giannis       143     35.7     (fourth worst)     DLo           141     39.0     (twelfth worst)
"John Wall is done, I’d be surprised if he’s starting past ASB"
John Wall is pretty inspirational when he’s not throwing up gang signs during games
"Literally, John Wall only got national attention when he was noticed at a camp when he was like 15 or 16, if he didn't go to that camp who knows if he goes to Kentucky, then who knows if he plays well enough to be drafted. It's all about exposure, but it is easier today with the internet the way it is. I remember Shaq and Kenny talking about how normally in the late 80's and early 90's 25 of the top 50 highschool prospects were from newyork just because the city had so much scouting"
"John ""throwin up gang signs"" Wall"
&gt; Makes you have more of an appreciation for pros who get drafted who actually excelled in school.. or at least cared enough to understand the value of it.  Aka John Wall.  He's what kids should really aspire to.  He was basically guaranteed to get into the league by the time he was 15 and still wants to finish his college degree during his time off with injury by going to school remotely.  It's hard enough already to get motivation doing school online when its the only thing you have going on but this guy is a multi multi millionaire already that's going to get it done
&gt;Anyone want… John Wall?
"Lol I love how you use like PPG and AST to justify your argument. The Sixers have around the same offense rating when Simmons is on vs off. The Sixers have a way higher offense rating when Embiid is on vs off.   John Wall averaged 20/7 last year. I guess he’s a huge positive on offense, just like Simmons."
TIL john wall is an asset
"John Wall, welcome to the bay. 😎"
"They didn't trade for those players with your hypothetical situation in mind, they traded for them with the current reality in mind. They will cross that bridge *if* they get there. If maxed out torn achilles John Wall can be traded, I don't think it would be hard to move the 43rd and 47th highest paid players in the NBA (Vuc is on a declining contract and actually making less next year than he is this year)."
In person? John Wall. Pre-injury John Wall was an elite defender
"Giannis is longer and stronger, but Simmons' speed puts him on the same tier among the NBA's athletic freaks.  Going into the draft, John Wall was timed at 3.14 seconds in the 3/4 court sprint.  Russell Westbrook was 3.08 seconds.  Ben Simmons did it in *3.05*.  And his [12'6 vertical reach is supposedly the best of any player in the NBA](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/120282/who-will-ben-simmons-be-in-the-nba).    The dude unquestionably has the natural gifts to be a superstar."
"John Wall is done. His stats are still there since he is on a bad team but he is done being a starter on a championship team. Not sure a ring coming off the bench improves his legacy any. Colin Cowherd even though a outrageous hot take, Wall did nothing to refute it."
I think John Wall could really use both   for his legacy.   He's in danger of being forgotten.
"John wall tore both acl and achilles too iirc and he came back not too bad, i expect klay better than him."
Saw a video where De'Aaron Fox was asked to compares himself with other speedy players like John Wall and Donovan Mitchell and he doesn't even give the other options a thought
It was John Wall before all the injury. Now id say it’s Fox or Edwards.
peak John Wall was a better overall player than peak Klay
I think the kicker is he didnt have one but two major injuries. Same with john wall and boogie
I remember when John Wall was leading drawing 3 point fouls because he used to never land on his feet when a defender was near. NBA media caught on and ran with the story so he stopped getting those calls.
He’s not John Wall he’s one of the greatest shooters the game has ever seen. Absolute worst case scenario is he turns into a bigger JJ Reddick
"Being a better athlete in no way makes him better?  Is Russ the best player in the league? How about Grayson Allen or John wall?  Athleticism can be a tool that helps you actually produce, in the way that someone like giannis does, but it by itself is pretty meaningless.  There are plenty of insane athletes with no basketball skill, who couldn’t even make the league.  Giannis isn’t the best player because he’s the most athletic.  Giannis is the best player because he plays DPOY defense and scores at a crazy efficient rate.  DWill couldn’t even use his athleticism to be an average defender, while Chris Paul was elite on defense.  There is nothing that DWill was better at than Chris Paul."
untradeable John Wall intensifies
Next : KD stops Harden- John Wall trade only because he is friends with Harden
He is tradeable lol.  They could trade him this second if they wanted to.  John Wall is untradeable.
You have John Wall over CP3? LMAO.  I can’t take your opinion seriously then.
Holy fuck NBA player John Wall can easily toy with unknown scrubs who woulda thought
People act like John wall is trash just because he’s overpaid. He’s still good enough to be a solid starting guard…. Just not at 45 million.
"I’d be fine with simmons depending on what he cost to get. Like some sixers fans are saying things like Wall+KPJ+3 picks and 3 pick swaps. What benefit would that give us? If that’s the type of offer necessary to get Ben, then yes, John can stay here for 2 years"
"you traded Russell Westbrook for John Wall and gave up Harden for pennies on the dollar, you're just as dysfunctional as us right now."
"What, you don't want John Wall?  Jokes aside, Rockets Twitter had an alarming amount of commentary on that potential trade. Like... we had Morey for a decade, that trade is never happening lol"
best player?  Have you not seen John walls named mentioned?  John wall!  *giggles*
"Again , someone mentioned john wall and I seriously forgot about that contract."
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
If you read just a bit more down you would see someone mentioned john wall and I completely forgot about him. Relax
John Wall + Eric Gordon
The rockets should be happy to get Simmons. Hes still super young and is a good player regardless of all the recent criticism. Theyd rather have John wall?
The washed corpse of John Wall is more valuable to the Sixers than Ben is to the Sixers
"Was john wall at his peak really a top 20 player in the league though? Washington is kind of a weird case bc they don't seem to care about winning but he was always extremely inefficient and had one good playoff year and you could argue that Beal was better than him in 2017 since he was putting up 2 less points but on like 5 less shots a game, I mean that was a big factor in Beal not wanting to play with wall anymore,  that and his inability to stay healthy. I'm not trying to say Washington was dumb for signing wall, you keep your assets rather them losing them for nothing ofc, but even from the day he signed that I always thought he was making more money than he provided."
"&gt; I mean lebron has been arguably the best player, has more in his arsenal than shooting 23 times to get 27 points, and has not been close to the 2nd highest paid player in the league.  This reflects a bit of a misunderstanding of how the CBA works. A max contract is a combination of the player's previous salary and a percentage of the team's total salary cap space.   The reason why LeBron has never been the 2nd highest paid player in the league is because he took a paycut when he went to Miami in 2010. That paycut has followed him through his entire career, and has put him in a place where it has been literally impossible for him to have the second highest salary in the league.   &gt;Just because other teams would max him, doesn't mean he isn't overpaid, a lot of teams would max Gobert that's still overpaid for what he provides you, same with even a healthy wall.  But the thing is, if you look at the top 20-25 players in the league, they're all worth *more* than a max contract. And I don't think there's any question that John Wall at his peak was top 20ish in the league.   &gt;I dunno how Walls contract isn't overpaid when he makes the 2nd most money and has never been close to the 2nd best player.  Simply because that's not how salaries work in a salary capped league. The actual salary of a max contract depends on a ton of things, including the BRI in the preceeding season, which is completely out of the player's (and team's) hands."
"Was john wall the 2nd best player in the league when he signed that contract? No, he wasn't even the best at his position. In multiple of his playoff series, including the last one he played he shot below, 40% from the field. His 27 pt performance are less impressive to those of us who remember him shooting 23 times a game to get there."
"right, but simmons still brings value to a team.  maybe he's not worth $35M per year.  but he's probably worth at least $20M, probably more than that on the right team.  John Wall is making an average of $45M over the next two seasons.  I guess he could get healthy and contribute, but based on his past few seasons I would expect just about 0 production out of that contract, so it is a much bigger waste and a true boat anchor."
Well there is John Wall and Kevin Love.
John Wall and couple of picks
John Wall the goat
"Even before the NBPA vote comes into play, the owners nip this in the bud. You think Portland would be clamoring to hold onto Dame for two years of his supermax if he tore his Achilles 6 months after signing the deal, 6 months before the extension kicks in? Imagine the Wizards not having the option of trading John Wall away after signing his Supermax no matter what the other teams offer them, no way in hell the teams approve of this."
"&gt;The issue with John wall is that he was an athletically reliant point guard who already had played a lot, the year after he signed said supermax he played 40 games. Guys like that don't age well you do not want a 30 year old version of that on your team making the 2nd most money in the entire league.  By this logic, you wouldn't have signed LeBron to any of the last 3 contracts he's signed then.  Are you taking a gamble by giving a player a max contract? Obviously. Was that a gamble 30 out of 30 teams would have taken with John Wall? Again, obviously."
"&gt; Is this a serious question...?   Yes, it is.  &gt;John Wall  He was not overpaid, he was one of the best PGs in the league when he signed that contract. The fact that he later got injured has nothing to do with the pay his agent got him during the last negotiations.  &gt;Ben Simmons  Ben is on a completely standard max extension for a player who is a number 1 pick, ROTY and All-Star. He would have gotten that exact same contract from any team, with any agent.   &gt;Lonzo Ball  You think so? Hollinger expected him to get a contract starting at $25 million a year, and he ended up on $18 million. Most reporters considered around $18 million to be the floor for Ball.   &gt;Eric Bledsoe  Really? What do you feel he's worth? He's on a two year contract, with only the first year fully guaranteed. He's making about half of what a max contract would be for his seniority. Seems about right where he should be.   &gt;Gary Trent jr  I reckon that's a bit early to say. If he keeps developing from how he played last year, he's a bargain on a contract that starts on $16 million. But he's a 22 year old kid coming off a rookie contract, so his career can obviously go in any direction still.   Overpaid, though? I bet a lot of teams would be happy to pay that for a 22 year old shooting almost 40% from 3PT, averaging 16 ppg.   &gt;KCP  Nah, man. His first contract with the Lakers was obviously an overpay, and entirely a bribe job for enticing LeBron to sign. However, his current contract is perfectly reasonable on the performance he's put up. Pretty average player making pretty average money, who signed an extension with a team that was salary capped and couldn't replace him if they let him go.  Anyway, like I said, Rich can get players paid when he can hold LeBron's weight over the head of the FO, which is exactly what happened in KCP's case.  &gt;Terrence Ross  Average player on an average contract. His base year salary was roughly 1.3 times the MLE, that's what he should be making.   &gt;Tristan Thompson  TT's current contract is at the MLE, which is where it should be. He's still a solid defensive player who can put up a few buckets on decent efficiency. That's what the MLE gets you.  His previous contract was an obvious overpay, but again, that's the LeBron effect, and the fact that the Cavs being capped out, they literally had no choice but to re-sign him.   &gt;JR Smith  Again, LeBron-cast signing. The Cavs have no choice but to sign him, as they can't replace him with the lack of cap space.   &gt;Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals.  It seems rather that your argument is that NBA salaries are too high, rather than these specific players being overpaid."
"Oh, please. John Wall was obviously getting a max contract with the performances he was putting up. Wall is overpaid **now** because he has been injury-ridden for the last several years, that has nothing to do with his agent. Unless Rich intentionally injured him."
Add John Wall. Get rid of Simmons and his liability of not making free throws
TLDR  John Wall and Ben Simmons play for Klutch sports and are currently representing for team NFT until further notice
"Since Simmons wants to be in California.  And john wall is the biggest name out there for a trade. I got a realistic trade ?   Sixers get wall, Heild , Davion Mitchell &amp; kings 2022 1st round pick  Rockets get sixers 2022 first round pick &amp; bagley  Kings get Simmons"
John Wall?
"Sure, if they want to take John Wall or Eric Gordon and zero picks or young players, that’s not a problem at all."
What's Houston going to given except John Wall to make salaries match?  I'm sure a 3rd team is definitely involved because no damn way the Sixers just get John Wall and picks.
Your team traded him for John Wall
**PG:** John Wall  **SG:** Anthony Edwards   **SF:** Ben Simmons  **PF:** Anthony Bennett   **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns
Why not trade Ben Simmons for John Wall?
John wide as a wall
&gt;Ah yes please give me John Wall for Ben and Maxey what a great trade that would be just give me the worst contract in the league for ~~one of the best defenders~~ **$33 million worth of otherwise tied up cap space** and a promising young guard  FTFY
I mean getting a guy like John wall could be fucking the team over just as much as getting no one..
"The issue with John wall is that he was an athletically reliant point guard who already had played a lot, the year after he signed said supermax he played 40 games. Guys like that don't age well you do not want a 30 year old version of that on your team making the 2nd most money in the entire league. There's more than just numbers in the playoffs, wall was overpaid then and he's overpaid now, part of that is just nba contracts but part of that is also a good agent."
yeah seriously this dummy thinks rich paul is NOT the reason that scrub John Wall putting up 27/10 in the playoffs got the supermax
Lmao this guy this guy includes John wall in a list of contracts and expects you not to immediately recognize him as overpaid.
John wall for Simmons no cap
"Is this a serious question...?   John wall, Ben Simmons, Lonzo ball, Eric bledsoe, Gary Trent jr, KCP, Terrence Ross, Tristan Thompson, tht.  Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals."
"Outside of the Bucks, John Wall used to be one of my favourite players.   Had such high hopes and each time he got injured I was so disappointed."
"His reputation around the league is still really high, players around the league love the guy. He hangs out with them often and. Hoops with em. Literally just go look at his Instagram story rn and you'll see he's kicking it with John Wall and they've got a good relationship. Regardless of what you read on the internet from a bunch of people that don't know him... the fact remains, YOU don't know him or who he is at all. Don't talk bout work ethic or personality cause again, you don't know him"
They just want the dopamine rush of a Woj tweet and are annoyed they’ve had to wait for months for that to happen.  They will literally say in the same breath that they can’t waste Embiids prime and say they should trade for John wall
Would John Wall work? Ya take our John Wall we get your Ben Simmons! Ya I like that
"not ben, or john wall(too much money to buyout / waive), but extra players involved in the trade."
steph's gather into his shot is basically non existent. it's honestly hard to compare him to other players. never seen a guy get a shot off as fast. we played ya'll one year and it made me realize that john wall is taking like 2 seconds to gather his 3 point shots.
"If they'll trade him straight up for one slightly used John Wall, we can figure something out!"
"Wall is the worst contract in the league and Philly can’t really do much with two Houston picks because they prolly won’t be THAT bad if Simmons is here  Tate, Gordon and Augustin all help the Sixers. They also get 4 unprotected firsts. That’s a much better package involving anything with John Wall in it."
I'm gonna be honest I'm worried about what Philly fans might do to themselves when Ben is traded for John Wall and a protected first. Suicide watch.
They’ll take John wall and a 1st and like it
"John Wall and Kevin Love were perennial all-stars!  They're up for grabs, PHI!      Other than that its CJ McCullum, who might've been an all-star in the eastern conference lol"
"to be fair to john wall, he and the rockets agreed to him sitting out the season but at least will attend training camps while they try to find him a new team. compared to Simmons, there's still some mutual respect between john wall and the rockets as well as the fan base. rockets fans arent burning john wall jerseys...I don't think many rockets fans have a john wall jersey to burn but I also dont think the fan base hates him like philly hates ben."
John Wall doesn't increase their championship odds lmao.
*Ben Simmons awkwardly filming a shirtless John Wall toweling himself off
"Imagine you could have had James Harden for Ben Simmons and end up with John Wall instead, scary hours."
"Can the 76ers actually get a better package than Wall/Gordon? I see a lot of folks that think the Rockets don’t make sense, but is there a better player than John Wall thats actually available?"
Ah yes please give me John Wall for Ben and Maxey what a great trade that would be just give me the worst contract in the league for one of the best defenders and a promising young guard 🙏
They really gonna trade for John Wall???? LMAO
"OP legit said ""John Wall for Ben Simmons, straight up.""  What are you on?"
"Yeah, he was at the same club as John Wall and PG a few nights ago."
"Just take John Wall, send Simmons to Minnesota, and be done with it. Hopefully Wall rebounds next to Embiid, and if not he's not there much longer."
"Eh I dunno how brilliant it is. So he wants to go to Lakers, GS type team. Good location, solid franchise. Do those teams want a player with an attitude like this that hasn't worked on the massive glaring problem yet in his career? If they do then it's brilliant, but I think he's more likely to end up getting traded for whatever disgruntled and washed player is out there with both teams hoping to salvage the other teams trainwreck. I think Simmons for John Wall is more likely than Simmons to GS for young players and picks at this point."
"Sixers could benefit from a point guard that can score, facilitate and defend. John Wall can get you 20 and 8 easy."
I mean that’s still the likely option. Obviously Ben won’t play but there isn’t an urgency to trade him when the best offer on the table right now is John Wall.
How does John Wall work for the Sixers?
"IT finished fifth in MVP voting the year John Wall slashed 23/10/4 and finished 7th. Arguably Wall’s best season. So even in Wall’s best season he was still behind IT, Curry, Russ, etc…"
"John Wall would be a downgrade at least defensively, will be the second highest paid player coming into this season and the highest paid player going into the one after that.   To consider how bad it would be for the 76ers, imagine it from Houston's perspective; they get rid of one of, if not *the*, worst contracts in the league and get an all-star DPOY candidate 25 year old in return."
I bet Tilman is cackling telling Stone to call Morey to offer him John Wall for Simmons
"John Wall for Ben Simmons, straight up.  Best offer … will include EG for old time sakes and a protected second round pick."
Don't kill me but... Simmons for John Wall?
"When Steph was ""good not great"" he was still better than Wall.  They were first-time all-stars in the same season, but at that point Steph was better and leading the Warriors to 50 wins.  John Wall was also good not great and had injury concerns in his first few years. He didn't play 70 games until his 4th season in the league.  I'd ask you to point out which year(s) in particular Wall was better than Steph or it was debatable."
No offense but John Wall has never been a top 3 point guard.
&gt;John wall is an all-nba level PG  we're done here
Keep puffing John Wall like GMs read these shitposts. No one is trading anything for Wall and his contract.
John Wall pretty much sucks now.
John Wall used to be a really good PG who was an inefficient scorer.    Unfortunately after those major injuries he’s had he’s no longer a really good PG anymore.  Injuries derailed his career.
John Wall can be good for them if he can understand his role.  Those long twos he loves taking were very annoying.   He’s still explosive but the question is can his body hold up.
"""John Wall is an all nba level PG"" he was that in 2017 when he was in his athletic prime, since then he missed two years, looked decent at times last year, but also looked like Dennis Smith Jr. half the season."
please explain to me how john wall and eric gordon are SCRUBS
rupturing you achilles isnt gonna make you unable to run a lot or even run fast. it will reduce your quick twitch ability a bit for sure. so some of those cuts wont be as quick but klays most important skill is still his shooting. its not like the achilles renders u unable to run fast. If you look at KD's athletecism its not noticably worse than it was before the injury. it has declined surely but hes still pretty quick and can still leap.   Like i said other sports players have came back fine from it. it has been improving in recent years. the nba gets a really bad rap for it because most of the guys who tear it are in their late 20s to early 30s and then when they come back they are never teh same. reality is that most of them likely would've been significantly worse after 2 years anyway into their early 30s. john wall is a good example in that he was a guy who would likely have regressed signicantly into his early 30s and the achilles definitely made him worse. but people look at him now and attribute all of teh decline to teh achilles.
"Not by me. I have been on team ""Russ should not have won that MVP"" since before it was announced. I was on team ""Well, he's better than John Wall, but sort of like in the way that a donut is better for you than a donut frosted with lard and sprinkled with lead paint chips""   I was against *this* trade when it happened. I thought the fit in Houston was terrible from the moment that trade happened. I thought he wasn't worth this extension.   I have no use for guards who can't shoot, and I never have."
He's tradeable. Washington moved John Wall so anything is possible. Hell Dallas could get John Wall right now.
"Wiz gonna be low key good. 5 or 6 seed IMO. Turning super max John Wall to KCP, Trez, Kuz, and picking up Dinwiddie was really good work by Tommy shepherd."
There was also a clip where John Wall grabs it from him and starts drawing up a play but I can't find it.
What are you thoughts on the Rockets sitting a healthy John Wall this year?
"Most of the shows I listen to on NBA radio say it sucks and even a few shows say Houston should be called out for how they handling John Wall.  (For the record, I listen to only 3 shows)"
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
"John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love and at a stretch Kristaps Porzingis are some of the worst contracts today."
"Klay was arguably never a max player even in his prime. Inconsistent in the playoffs and as noted by Thinking Basketball, drops off quite a bit in the playoff impact metrics. He's around 20 PPG and 59-60% TS player that spaces the floor but has some poor defensive metrics despite his reputation. That's not worth a max in this league even though he played like a max player in the 2019 finals. He got the money largely out of respect.   Now consider the fact that he was injured for 2+ years, that alone tanks his value per money spent. And we think he'll come back like KD did but he's a very rhythm based player and still relied on quickness for on ball defense. You'd be lucky if this guy average 12-15 points on 58% TS and that's just 'okay' in today's league.  Still, John Wall is probably worse."
"Right now? Either John Wall or Love. In 2 years, Jimmy is going to have an all time horiffic contract."
John Wall 10000000%
John wall is for sure the worst. As for your list jimmy butler should not be on there and Kevin love should at least be ahead of hayward.
"Parsons is one of those classic examples of a NBA player taking full advantage of the guaranteed contracts. The leverage of a NBA player is like 80/20 in a way (especially nowadays). He couldn't be cut like what happens in the NFL and the franchise is obligated to pay millions for a guy crippled by injuries to stay at home treating those injuries. Klay could be the next example, if he blown his knees yet again, 3 straight seasons without playing and receiving full money nonetheless. John Wall is another current example, etc.."
Should explore trading Westbrook for John Wall
"I mean at some point you're allowed to criticize moves right?   Like if the Lakers traded LeBron for John Wall, can I call it a disaster?"
Since the first time I started saying that Westbrook was washed he’s been traded for  - CP3 (and picks???)  - John Wall (and a pick?)  - all the Lakers good role players  There’s always a bigger sucker
They need to trade him for John Wall
"Embiid and Morey are extremely close. That was the only positive news to come out of the summer, and I know it got overshadowed by Simmons stuff.   Morey is not making a single personnel decision or non-decision without Embiid’s approval.   If Embiid says he wants to trade Ben for John Wall Morey would do it and every Sixers fan would accept that it was Joel’s will."
While I think its fair to be worried about Zions career Ja isn't exactly a beacon of health either. He has potential injury concerns with the way he plays and missed a good chunk of time last year  I'd understand some people saying Ja could have a better career because Zions status is definitely far from a sure thing. But Ja himself easily could become the next D Rose or John Wall and be saddled with injuries that rob him of his prime ability which means its hard to discount that part when discussing them
I feel like it's now at John Wall and two protected firsts for Simmons is the value.
"Above-average defensive talent, although not extraordinary. His problem is that he's smaller than John Wall and tends to get bullied HARD by proper forwards."
"How good Russell was in his 2012-2017 prime is a reasonable discussion. He was very good.   But he hasn't posted all-NBA-type numbers in many years now. If you look at current max guys by salary, I'd say they only people in the top 30 who are probably lower value on the court than Westbrook, right now, are John Wall,  Wiggins, Love. Maybe Simmons, but there's no way PHI would trade Simmons for Westbrook right now."
"Even as a Wizards fan, this is not true. People considered Westbrook and Harden (and kinda Steph but honestly most people were still really salty about the warriors back then) to be in a different tier. The debate was for 3rd best PG between John Wall, IT (remember he came in 5th MVP voting that season), and kinda kyrie."
"The thing with the John Wall situation is that it was the team's call.   He wants to play; the team doesn't.   Frankly speaking, I'd say he's being pretty professional about it. If that was me, I'd be like ""Put me on the court or buy me out. I want to play the game!"""
Congratulations too all the people who bought stolen artwork and got scammed by John Wall 👍
"agreed, washington fans on here love them some john wall, couldn't beat a Paul Millsap lead hawks team"
What they meant was John Wall was gonna lead them through the Process and secure them the 1 seed of the first pick in the draft lol
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
No way he sniffs top 10 if he doesn’t improve that jumper. He reminds me of John Wall
"Wall was never better than Steph and CP3. In peak Westbrook years, Westbrook was clearly ahead. You can argue Dame, he wasn't the same player back then as he is today.   I know this is a ""John Wall was great thread"", but if I completely keep the hindsight aside, in 2017, John Wall was broadly considered only the 3rd best point guard, IN THE EAST. Kyrie was fresh off a championship season, and IT had a historical offensive season and knocked Wall out in the playoffs.    John Wall was not the best PG in the league, that would be a massive stretch."
"in the playoffs from 2017 on he averaged like 27/11/5, dude was the engine of those teams and he was so exciting to watch. that behind the back dunk was only possible by john wall"
how is john wall or gobert on this list
There will be no John wall slander in this chat
John Wall absolutely 100% deserved it when he signed it.
Chuck really woke up today and decided to end John Wall
"what team is looking at the state of their roster and thinking ""john wall is the missing piece"""
"It’s “could”, and yes, in any given generation there are probably 20-25 guys who’d be top 10 in the league for a couple seasons or more if everything breaks right. Everything very often doesn’t break right, hence John Wall and Derrick Rose and hell, maybe even Greg Oden."
"That sounds nice in theory but in practice the super maxed guy is now untradeable. And I’m sure that sounds nice at first too but what happens when you’re left holding the bag with John Wall or Russell Westbrook? Those deals might not even be moveable for each other under current cap rules, and NBA cap rules are already pretty Byzantine."
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
John Wall deserved the 2016-17 all nba 2nd team over Isiah Thomas. Will die a gruesome and painful death on this hill
So what is gonna happen with John wall? Is he injured or just not playing
That year (2014-15) John Wall had 17.6 ppg on 52.3% TS to Kyrie's 21.7 on 58.3% TS. That is a very significant gap in both volume and efficiency. John Wall was below league average efficiency that year!
"I agree with this. It's so hard to explain why John Wall was so important for Washington, because his advanced stats weren't stellar.   Only thing to do is just watch, or, look at the results of when he would have bad games, especially during the playoffs."
John wall is a first ballot hall of famer
"All NBA selections are made by fallible reporters chasing narratives.  You may be right that John Wall wasn't top 10, but he was at least close.  For a couple years there he played elite defense and led the league in assists (for a period, not single year) while scoring efficiently.  When he had a mismatch he would mercilessly destroy teams.  It's not a ludicrous notion that he could have slid in to the top 10 in what should have been his prime."
just like john wall in his entire rookie season lmao
The consensus that John Wall is washed is a REALLY stupid narrative and wouldn’t even be a discussion if he was on a smaller contract
"They're not exactly the same situation because one was a boost off the rookie max and the other was off of the max with more years of service time. The analogous part is that they both made an all-nba team, third team, for the only time in their careers, and became eligible for more money because of it. If John Wall hadn't made that all-nba third team, and he nearly didn't, he would never have gotten the contract he did."
John Wall was arguably the best PG the year he got maxed. You had to.
John wall lol
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
"I mean not many players do. I can't really think of a player besides John Wall who isn't ""worth"" it at the time of signing. Maybe Westbrook but he won MVP.   What would be the requirement then?"
"John Wall - a player with flaws, but, a damn good player at his peak. And, he was loyal to the organization when he had a chance to leave, despite there being problems with team's roster construction."
I doubt it will do that much damage. Klutch may lose some smaller clients but as long as they have guys like Trae signing a $207 M contracts or John Wall being the second highest paid player in the league you can afford to lose the 4% on the contracts of the backup centers around the league
"Harden definitely deserved out. He gave them his all and after taking the best team ever to a game 7 he was left with John wall, Christian wood and Demarcus cousins no offence but that’s not winning you anything in the nba. They were just getting worse and worse."
John Wall
Yeah the coward is the guy who wanted to leave a bad situation to play for  a ring in his 30's.  Shouldve stayed to play with washed up John Wall
"Just to highlight how long ago 5 years is, 5 years ago, the following players played in the All Star Game: Isaiah Thomas, John Wall, Kevin Love, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan.  Those guys have had varying degrees of success since then, and contribute to winning, but when was the last time anyone thought of any of those guys as stars?"
"AD and Harden did do it respectfully, Harden was heavily rumored to have been talking about leaving which made the FO panic and trade for John Wall in an atempt to please him, AD probably asked for a trade at the beginning of the season but seeing as how they didn’t trade him he decided to take his trade request public to force the pels hand"
"The number of players making a supermax is in single digits, so John Wall alone makes it more than 10%. The NBAPA will agree to provision like that with the condition that the trade must be demanded by the player."
Teams don’t trade away good players. They trade away bad players. Their penalty is losing multiple draft picks and taking on lesser bad contracts potentially to move the player they’re trading.   They already get penalized to move a player on a bad contract. It’s why Houston isn’t trading John Wall right now as the penalty would be to great until they’re able to do a buyout.
"This could work if they structure it properly. Similar to what Anthony Davis did when he waived the trade kicker in order to facilitate his trade to the Lakers, I could see the league structuring anything over 25% cap with a ""reverse trade kicker"" that pays out as long as you're on the original team but can be waived by the player if they want to facilitate a trade to a new team. Everyone's thinking about Ben Simmons, but think of the benefit to someone like John Wall whose contract could actually get moved and he could play again if he was able to waive a portion of his current contract."
"John Wall was known as Optimus Dime, which is a fire nickname imo"
"Exactly the point.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, John Wall, AD and Jimmy Butler all had that option as well.  That's 8 max contract players (not counting Ben Simmons) in just the last couple of years. ESPN keeps pushing the Zion and Doncic want our narrative too which would be 11 players."
Nothing short of John wall is less
"The argument you reference would be relevant if teams could decide to stop paying a player under contract. Then either party could agree to terminate their contractual obligations whenever they feel like it. But you don't see the Rockets telling John Wall ""You're not good any longer, so we're not going to pay you"".  The issue is that one party - surprisingly, the owners - are fulfilling their contractual obligation to pay the player (even when they'd rather not) while the other party (Harden, Simmons, etc.) is not fulfilling their obligation to play basketball for the team paying them."
"Exactly. At one point Otto Porter Jr (got a max RFA offer sheet) was being paid a higher salary than John Wall and Bradley Beal while on the same team. But somehow the ""others"" are being screwed over in this system... lol  Giannis is only making about $5-10mil more per year than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. He is drastically underpaid bc his salary is capped by the CBA"
"&gt;“James Harden took the money and said f— you and gave Houston the middle finger,”  pretty sure it was the other way around when ferttita asked harden after years of carrying pretty decent rosters to the brink against the greatest team of all time to then carry the corpse of john wall and christian wood +a bunch of g-leaguers to the same success after firing the GM that helped enable harden to achieve that success"
"John Wall had a couple of these. I can't recall a layup fired so late in the jump, from so low, yet getting the ball so high as Morant did."
Honestly John Wall would be the best to learn from. He had excellent defense in his Washington days and would be able to get his by playing fast while still being pass first... plus he’s already in house. Don’t play him but I hope he’s teaching in practice
lol do u have john wall as well lol
"And angrily too. Like mans was fr trying to mosh up the floor on the way down. I guess that mentality is why he was a killer, but damn jordan was floating in comparison to them.   John wall too, needs some KOTG that guy has gamechanging shit he showed how Kob used to train all jumps equally, how MJ had ridiculous ankle mobility and tendon stiffness"
"A guy in mine drafted Kyrie, Simmons, John Wall, and Zion. We only have 1 IR slot too."
"Right this second?   1. Trade him to the Timberwolves for picks, Beasley, Prince and Okogie or Jaden McDaniels before the TWolves go on a win streak and don't want to trade anybody.   2. Trade him to the Cavs for picks, Sexton and John Wall (KLove goes to the Rockets to get bought out).   Since those are probably the only options still available to the 76ers and there is a risk of Ben's value going down even more."
"Draymond has definitely been better on the Warriors. Impact metric wise he blows Klay out of the water especially. But if Draymond didn’t play with a PG/SG with the Splash brothers off ball prowess or Kerr’s system his passing  would not be a big factor.If he got drafted and played with John Wall or Trae or a lead guard who runs an efficient pick and roll heavy offense he would be considered a below average offensive player, a bad scorer who only fans of his team know can make nice reads.   Steph used to play more like a traditional PnR guard before Kerr, in 2014 he averaged 24/4/9 on 60% TS and was top 20 in the league in iso frequency, way more unassisted baskets compared to now. If Steph continued that way the idea that Dray would be considered the best passer on the team one day (which I don’t agree with but many people believe) is a pipe dream.    Klay, however, would be the same player anywhere. He would just get more scrutiny for his lack of shot creation/cold streaks  if he was a #1."
John Wall is in there too. I don't feel like I've ever seen someone with more end to end speed. Maybe it's his long strides but it felt like dude had rockets in his legs
He definitely had more muscle which allowed him to just explode in any direction he wanted. But because Ja is probably 10-15lbs lighter than rose I think he certainly jumps higher.  Rose was the fastest player I’ve ever seen tho.  Him and Lebron back in 2012 were the greatest fast break transition players I’d ever seen. Special shout outs to young John Wall and Westbrook.
John Wall - downright criminal what Ted/EG gave this man to work with over the course of his career.
Could consolidate some smaller contract guys into one extra player for depth.  They will have to do most of the work through the buyout market this year though because of their salary composition. John Wall would probably be the best option for them if he can be talked into taking a buyout.
"The wizards are my team, but they do nothing but waste/kill talent. I wish we could've had the team we have now just with John Wall."
Definitely John Wall. There's a better chance that he gets hurt so there is hope whereas Westbrook likely plays a lot more.
John Wall for sure their best player they bought to play with him was fucking past his prime old ass Paul Pierce. His team was shit Beal was always injured too.
John Wall.
Give me John wall I’d swap him for Westbrook rn
John Wall
You're force to take either John Wall or Westbrook for the Sixers.  They must play and cannot be traded.  Who do you choose.
"Bradley beal and John wall. Randy wittman was bad enough, then they made it even worse by bringing in Scott brooks thinking that it would somehow attract Durant, when in reality Durant already knew how bad of a coach brooks was and knew he wasn’t a guy he could win with, so you wasted five years of these guys on a stupid coaching hire that did the complete opposite of what you thought it would do, not to mention all the stupid ass personnel moves by grunfeld during his tenure like giving Ian mahinmi 4/64 trading Kelly Oubre for the corpse of Trevor ariza and plenty of other terrible decisions I’ve blocked out of my memory. Grunfeld and wittman/brooks did everything they could to thwart this team and wall and beal still drug them to the playoffs every year. Scott got so thoroughly outcoached by Brad Stevens in the Celtics series when John hit that game winner in game 6 to extend the series that it makes me puke every time I think about it. John played through wear and tear injuries for years and now he’s too broken down to be a consistently effective player, and I’m praying the new management has enough sense to make good on what we have left from beal, returns are positive so far but guh what a waste of mainly John walls tremendous potential"
And John Wall before him.
"And John Wall before him. Ernie never understood how to build around the fastest guy in the league who was also great at finding 3 point shooters. And never built enough depth that the team could survive a month without Wall, so he ruined his knees playing hurt."
"John Wall ended up getting paid, but, the Washington front office made such crap decisions that didn't really make the team better beyond him, back when he was at his best, especially the decisions made in the 2016 summer (before Wall was even eligible for the supermax).   Ernie Grunfeld and the other front office executives at the time were not thinking hard about the future, leaving Washington all capped out, before Wall's supermax kicked in."
John Wall tore his Achilles in his home. I twisted sprained my ankle stepping off of the bus once. These players don’t only exist in basketball games.
There is always John Wall.
We can’t attract FAs ever. That’s literally why our only option is to do this or to trade for guys. But when trading for guys you still have to consider if they wanna be here and what it’s actually going to mean for us in terms of winning. Who do you think we can trade for that would turn us into a winning team and the player would want to be here long term?   It’s actually AGAINST our best interest long term to “try and win.” We even fucked ourself last season just for winning TWO games we shouldn’t have against Boston and Clippers. Being a middling team isn’t enough to attract or keep talent in small markets like it is for the Lakers or the Nets…   Why is nobody mad that John Wall doesn’t play for Houston or that they shut him down last year? How many teams ever become a legitimate contender without having at least a few years sub .500 ESPECIALLY after being pretty much a .600 team or better for 11 straight years? Basically only the Spurs? So maybe y’all can stfu about OKC when they are only going in to the second season of being sub .500 after a continued run of excellence that some franchises only dream of. How many years has Orlando been “trying to compete” and how has that worked out for them? Different teams have to employ different strategies and even then it won’t work out the same for everyone. This is not a one size fits all kinda thing
"the john wall comparison are real, he dont have clutch genes as well. as good as they are they can't carry in clutch"
"Thank you for saying this man lol.  As a Hawks fan I feel like I’m taking crazy pills reading posts where people downplay our team.   Just waves of athleticism, skill, and motor at every position.  It’s like a pro version of those ridiculously stacked Kentucky teams when John Wall and Demarcus Cousins played there."
"I don't really understand your stance, Are you saying the Wizards were making the playoffs with John Wall?"
The Rockets for John Wall.
Washington trade can only be considered bad because he left but he's still better than John Wall was last season
When LeBron trades him for John Wall at the deadline.
"Lol bro Wizards are just a deep team man with Spencer Dinwiddie, Kuzma, Harrell, etc.  Westbrook was starting with Raul Neto at SF and Alex Len at Center.   Gafford was an extremely late acquisition that didn't even start.  I'd say the Wiz now have a real team with depth where the starting 5 are pretty legit.   Wizards didn't need guys like John Wall and Westbrook taking up $45 million of salary. Spreading it across Kuzma, Harrell, Dinwiddie were the right moves."
"john wall might accept buyout to get signed by warriors, imagine him backing up steph."
The Rockets would be happy to move John Wall.
Right now it’s probably at the level of the John Wall/Russell Westbrook contracts.
john wall
I bet John Wall could enjoy it
John Wall has turned into Gilbert Arenas of 2020’s. Washed up star player with a giant contract.
"1 - This report is most likely bull shit  2 - If it does happen, it could only happen if Wall is bought out or something. You'd have to be out of your mind to think John Wall is worth his contract in 2021."
"John Wall is owed 45 + 47m. This isn't an expiring contract a team just trades for to get rid of bad contracts - why? Because it's too much money.  No team would want to give up **picks and almost 50m/y in players** so that they have cap space in 2023's FA. It works with smaller expiring contracts which can actually be positive trade assets in their last year, as they can help a team correct a mistake like Bertans.  And of course Wall isn't CP, he can't lead a team to the finals, he has no trade value at all. We might very easily see a buyout."
PG issues you say? May I interest you with one slightly used John Wall?
Everyone wants to see John wall on the knicks honestly but I don’t see how it would work without some kind of buyout and wall doesn’t seem to wanna take a paycut so 🤷🏻‍♂️
so your the one? The one John Wall truther.
I’m assuming Knicks give John wall a chance to play but he will need a buy out from Houston first
John Wall is the only thing they can get
"how the hell can they trade for john wall, the salaries are 35 million apart.  I can't possibly see that happening"
"John wall is my favorite. Hope he lands in a good situation soon. Was awesome to watch in person, must have seen at least 200 games from 2012-2018."
John wall is washed. That is exactly him. He has no place on a good team
Forunier and burks are better players than the corpse of john wall. This does not make the team better
"Man, to think at one point Kemba and John wall were the most must see pgs In the league"
"Why would they make this trade? John Wall has too many injuries , he never made his team better, and its unclear if he can even play anymore. Once they trade for him, its final. he cannot be moved."
give up depth and kemba for john wall  well knicks would do this anyday   /s
&gt;John Wall  Why TF would we trade for him?
Wall doesn’t fit with the Knicks. Thibs has always been a defensive guy. Kemba is not a good defender and neither is John Wall. He has DRose and IQ off the bench for scoring and playmaking. He needs a floor general who can play defense as his starter. No point in trading for him it’s just redundant.
For an extra washed John wall? New York would implode
John wall looked extra washed in his freeme video.
John wall to the heat no Knicks please
The threat of John Wall coming back got them playing better tbh
"Bouknight and PJ is a nice package but we are stacked at the guard position  Green, KPJ, Gordon, Christopher and very soon John Wall"
Hopefully this doesn't turn into another John Wall situation. I still can't believe the Nuggets gave him a 5 year max with his medical history.
https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1465519612791984128    &gt; The Rockets have won 3 in a row. &gt;  &gt; John Wall is coming back. &gt;  &gt; The championship run starts now.
"He needs to learn to not rely too much on that lightning-quick frst step and his athleticism. We've all seen how high motor guards fall off the cliff the moment they lose those abilities. John Wall, Derrick Rose, now Kemba. If Ja can learn how to be a lot more creative with not using too much athleticism on his drives, he'd be set.   It's also the reason why guards who rely more on finesse and shooting are still out there playing and prodcing. CP3, Kyle, Steph all have incredibly deep bags. It's also the reason why I think Luka can play for  two decades and not lose too much."
"John Wall is not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need"
KPJ with the John Wall triple double
We need John wall back ASAP. We are winning too much
"Alright, starting to threaten the tank. Start John Wall and Theis"
[Here comes John Wall.](https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/Exhi4mRWYAQ0FpR?format=jpg&amp;name=small)
I saw a Celtics fan talking shit about John Wall and I had a flashback to 2017 and almost started defending him on instinct
We don’t care about who is better  We are trying to develop these guys. They need time and reps  They are not gonna get enough touches if John Wall is in the mix
John Wall
"Reminder that just last year, John Wall was less efficient than KPJ, who didnt have pre season, came in mid season with a worse team than Wall had most of the season  Wall is better  Thats not the point  They are close enough for it to make sense playing the young guy"
"Even if this were true, out of shape John Wall would still be better than 37% FG Kevin Porter Jr"
I really don't think they're close to as worried as people on reddit seem to think about John Wall coming back and winning them a bunch of games.  He's not that good(anymore).
"Yeah I totally agree. I don’t think it helps anyone to just keep him out of the rotation. Say what you want about John wall, he’s not a complete scrub… I really think he could help relieve some of the load off everybody, especially the guards.  I probably came off as some KPJ hater, I’m not. I just feel like there’s way too much optimism surrounding him than his level of play has justified. I don’t think he sucks.. I think he needs help. Like I said, he looks overwhelmed."
"Agreed he's trying to play too fast.  Gotta remember that his first couple seasons were marred by off court issues, COVID stoppages, etc ... he's only played about one season's worth of games, and only started 42 of them.  I wouldn't give up on him just yet but I'm way more skeptical than I was going into this season.  I just don't see John wall as the answer ... we know what he is.  If he and the Rockets agreed to play him on a reduced role - say 22 mpg off the bench - I'd be in favor of it.  I think he can help develop some of our younger guys."
"Yeah wtf are you talking about when John Wall has NEVER in his whole career shot anything even remotely like Steph. Dumbest thing I’ve read on here in a minute &amp; Curry does NOT have the ball blocking his view of the rim on his form. I can’t believe you got upvoted on that lol. He shoots from the right side of his face and with the one motion he finishes the shot with his elbow at forehead.   On top of it all Curry is unique to himself with his one motion shot. He’s not a textbook case AT ALL &amp; not who you’d want younger players or bad shooters to model their shot off of bc it’s incredibly difficult.  Easier to teach a two motion shot. Elbow at the forehead, fingers spread, space between the palm &amp; ball, ball is shot mainly off first three fingers, index being the last to touch, &amp; guide hand on side of the ball. That’s what I’d teach John Wall. Not this wonky ass form he’s shooting with rn."
The stories of freak athletes who weren’t durable because of poor nutrition are plenty. Derrick Rose and John Wall are notable examples. Just because his kids are tall and can play a game well enough to get noticed as teenagers doesn’t mean they’re actually built to last as professional athletes.
dog brain  get back to me when John Wall plays and he's terrible
"Have you seen pre-injury John Wall? that's how.   He is very obviously much slower than he was. He was regularly the fastest player on an NBA court and that first step would frequently result in either a layup, a trip to the FT line, or a kickout to an open shooter. If he can't blow by his man all three of those go out the window. Without being able to break down the defense off the dribble he's just a 6'4"" guy with flashy handles."
You should know John Wall isn’t worth playing either then… since you watch so much basketball
John wall was already a proven all star though
Yeah it’s John wall and it’s not even close even if mpj never plays a game again he is still making considerablely less then John wall is.
if he doesn't hit any incentives it's 5 year/145.  Definitely sucks but doesn't really sniff being as bad as John Wall signing a supermax and then never playing on it
John Wall is not a starter unless you want to waste minutes and lose
"So I am/was a Uconn fan. The first big thing I remember about Kemba was 2009 early season matchup with Kentucky and John Wall. I watched that game and Uconn lost by 3(to a much more talented team) but what I came away with that game was, ""Kemba could hang with Wall"" We know how the rest of Kemba's college career went including one of my favorite game winners of all time in your crib. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6eMBvSiOq0&amp;ab\_channel=RiseberryBasketball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6eMBvSiOq0&amp;ab_channel=RiseberryBasketball)  My question is, who had the better pro career? Kemba or Wall. Assuming both are on the downward trajectory(which appears to be the case)"
"1. Curry didn't drop 12+ spots because of his ankles  2. Ankle injuries &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Back injuries  3. Curry was resigned later on, not extended a year early  4. Curry had 1/10th the injury history of porter  5. You can find 50 other contracts given out to injury prone players that crippled their teams, don't look at the 1 top 15 player all time who completely over came them lol  Joakim noah (crippled knicks), amare (crippled knicks), john wall (essentially got traded with a first for the wizards core rn so it worked out but was crippling them),"
"4 years ago you had Curry, WB, John Wall, Kyrie, Lilliard, Harden, Lowry. Which one of those was he better than lol"
His contract will be used to trade for John Wall.
"Just change Jokic's name to ""John Wall"" and everything will be cool."
"Dude, he’s getting paid 8 mil. Not 44. This is nowhere near a John Wall situation. He’s situational now, like he always should have been. Our tempo is slow as fuck with him and Randle together. At least the ball will be pushed a bit more now."
That john wall thing is false
"it is simple the coach need to step up and make it fit and figure shit out, im knicks fan and have watched every single game, i mean they can have kemba off the bench he does provide some offense or some shit but to get that pay and completely out of the rotation he might as well be john wall rn smfh"
John Wall is still a starter. Rockets are dumb for thinking KPJ is a point guard in the NBA.
Kevin Love is still in the rotation  John wall would be in the rotation if he accepted a backup role
8 mil is nothing…look at John wall or Kevin love
John Wall
Future member of the John Wall Allstars
"Believe me, the Rockets would LOVE to be free of John Wall and his contract as well. Problem is, no one wants him for how much he is getting paid. Heck, even half off it would be debatable if anyone wanted him."
John Wall was pretty bad
"John Wall cannot be a starter on a contending team, he doesn't have that point guard leadership ability."
John wall wants to play so he want to the FO to give reasons why he should not. As reported by a bs artist.
"Maybe he sees himself as the no. 1 option at point guard for them. Which is a totally valid thing. With reporters nowadays though, of course you’re only going to get REPORT: John Wall says he should be “no. 1 option…” smh."
&gt; Also why people who generate defensive “highlights” are often not great defenders.  John Wall post 2017
"It’s really simple. Give John wall the green light, what’s the worst that can happen? Either he’s washed in which case he gets to be tank commander and vet presence. Or, he’s not washed, and actually ends up playing pretty well, in which case you could probably convince the Lakers to trade for him or something lol."
"In a comment thread about John Wall, yes"
"In a thread about signing Cousins, John Wall is the corpse?  He's not as washed as everyone says he is, but I agree he'd be a bad sign for your squad."
"You've got Grayson Allen playing the best basketball of his career, and still need to re-integrate DiVincenzo into the line-up, and you've got Jrue excelling at his natural position, coming off a title and on a hot winning streak. Why would you push Jrue to the 2 to take on a damaged John Wall, when you could just win without him?"
Why isn’t John Wall playing?
"You're taking it the wrong way, nobody is against the Rockets on this side of the issue (well, except maybe John Wall lol). The problem is the league moving goalposts all the time while saying it's under the guise of ""preservation of the integrity of the game"". Even if they're right (in principle), the way they're handling it is more consistent with the reasons of loss of revenue/ fan attendance  From [NBA Denies Threatening Pelicans with Fines for Benching Anthony Davis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/sports/nba-anthony-davis-fines.html)      This season, though, several players with smaller profiles than Davis have been shelved by their teams in anticipation of a trade without any public pushback from the N.B.A.          Like Davis, Chandler Parsons of Memphis and Carmelo Anthony, the former Houston Rocket, wanted to play but were benched for months.  I mean yeah, I get it, we don't care about Wall. If it's a healthy Lebron we're talking about though, you bet that's gonna be a different story."
Do you think John Wall went into a meeting and told the Rockets “I want to be the first option” then went home after it was reported and said “that’s a lie.”  it’s almost certainly Schultz lying/getting fake info
They are getting John Wall?
How much he is making shouldn't be a factor at all.  What's more important to the league is integrity and revenue.  Are the Rockets losing games on purpose by not playing John Wall? Is the league and its sponsors losing revenue because John Wall isn't playing?  That was a much more obvious answer with AD.
John Wall would not be a clean fit on the Heat. Plus don’t they have Oladipo?
"Yeah, my problem is just that I see people attacking John wall already. Sure the report might be true, but given Schultz's history, I'm very skeptical and don't want to jump to conclusions yet."
"Maybe but I don't see why they wouldn't let him play at least a little if he wants to. Sure they want to develop young guys, but they've  also given Dj Augustin and garrison Matthews minutes this season. Also Its not like playing John wall would make them good enough to not get a high draft pick. If anything, his trade value might go up if he plays decent."
"I know this is a joke but he's probably very good. Nowhere near NBA level of course, but he's gotta be decent if he's training with John wall."
"But from the league's standpoint, that's not their problem. It's up to Houston as an organization and John Wall as a professional to find a workaround, but they can't just sit him (no matter the role) now that he said he wants to play."
They desperately need a real PG. But a shot-happy John Wall serves no purpose for them.
He’s not a future one…he’s a lead guard…he’d be playing better next to a solid pg who’s not overly ball dominant and willing to play 25 mins…but John wall ain’t that
https://twitter.com/JohnWall/status/1465149795002114048?t=rZKYV8BnvRfnFY2QOU2OBg&amp;s=19   Looks like John Wall is calling this guy's BS again
"Just a weird way of phrasing that his athleticism won’t be enough to stay in front NBA point guards. At the time, point guard was arguably the most athletic position in the league, with prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Deron Williams, among others.   Curry definitely ended up being faster than anyone expected him to be, especially after putting a lot of work into his body. And the point guard position slowed down, with less of an emphasis on relentless slashing."
Redditor tells John Wall his moves don't work in the NBA
John wall has every right to believe that. Its not in his best interest to stay in houston or submit to their development if hes on the way out anyways.
Because the rockets are bad. My original point was John wall makes y’all better as a top 2 option.
Bro we dont care about our Record John Wall isnt part of the future so we got no need to have him play hero ball
"If John Wall has the greenest light ever and takes 30+ shots a game, I might tune in to a Rockets games this season."
"Depends on their goal. If the goal is to tank while not developing their young talent and allowing John wall to pad his stats, then absolutely. Start the man.  If the goal is just to make it through the next 6 months with him collecting a fat paycheck while looking angry on the bench, then I would sit him."
"It was in this tweet that's the subject of this REddit thread. Even Shams, who is Klutch, posted in his article about it that the issue is that the Rockets won't guarantee Wall a starting spot.   https://theathletic.com/2983329/2021/11/28/john-wall-wants-to-return-to-play-and-start-the-rockets-want-him-to-come-off-the-bench-what-are-their-options/  ""Wall spoke to Rockets officials and stated his desire is to play, have a starting role and compete to maintain it, but **the franchise informed him that they want him to come off the bench, and not start, in order to play**, sources tell The Athletic. The outcome of the conversations is that Wall will continue to sit out games while remaining professional and being around and engaged with the team, sources said. Rockets officials informed Wall in their conversations on Sunday that they were **not willing to guarantee him a starting role**."""
John Wall
Eric Gordon is actually good  John Wall………… has his moments
Why the fuck would I be talking about prime John Wall lmao I’m obviously talking about Wall at this point in his career
"Well yeah the dudes not playing, unless your talking about prime john wall in which case you need to be put in a mental hospital."
John Wall great defender. X Doubt
"Tony Parker, Jaylen Brown, John Wall, George Hill, Jo Jo White, Elton Brand"
"tf you mean outplaying? lillard got 30 9 and 4 vs john wall 20 6 and 5. I wasnt really watching the game so there could be stuff i missed, but that does not seem like outplaying"
"Wall: does anything  Reggie: ""that's vintage John Wall right there"""
John wall is having a good comeback too. KD naturally just a better player so his comeback looking way better
"If you’re asking whose better between Westbrook last year and John Wall so far, it’s Westbrook and it’s not particularly close."
John Wall has something to say about that
"John Wall is certainly helping the Rockets win. He isn't worth his contract, but he has actually looked solid all things considered."
I also like it when John Wall dribbles between my  legs ‼️😈
John Wall outplaying Lillard? What year is it?
John wall is still one fast dude
Better team? Sure.  Worse than John Wall? No.  Westbrook is not the same as he was last year.
Reggie Miller when John Wall does a basic dribble https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF8GhC-T_Mo
"Terrible take. John Wall isn't playing well, he's just been better than Westbrook this season"
"Uhm, Reggie Miller, other than John Wall the other two are no longer stars."
"* Blake Griffin: 2 years, $75.6M * Russell Westbrook: 3 years, $132.9M * John Wall: 3 years, $132.6M * Kevin Love: 3 years, $91.5M  I'd rather have Blake's contract than Westbrook, Wall, or Love. None of them are helping you win but at least Blake comes off the books 1 year earlier. If you're bad, you might as well be bad and get a good draft pick.  Also, I really really hope not, but Klay Thompson's 5 year, $190M definitely has the potential to be the worst contract in the league..."
"yeah that’s fair. i have a feeling john wall will be around for a little while. im excited about tate (25), wood (25), jones (22), and kevin porter (20) — it seems like these young guys appeared out of thin air."
John Wall is my favorite wall in all of Texas.
JOHN WALL JUST DID THE HARDEN
"John wall is looking so good, it's amazing"
"john wall is blind. he has a wide open wood rolling, puts up a contested layup instead lol"
John Wall is one tough looking dude
John Wall scores 45 tonight
This is what I am referring to: https://cbssportsradio.radio.com/articles/gilbert-arenas-explains-why-john-wall-kevin-durant-will-be-fine
The same ‘a’ sound as in John Wall.
"Not trying to compare talents, but John wall is also having an amazing recovery. He is of course not even close to Durant but I am just really happy and didn't expected it, since he was a player that used his athleticism very much"
1. I haven’t heard Beal say one thing on the level of what James Harden has said about the rockets  2. we all know signing a long term deal in the nba doesn’t mean anything in terms of staying with that team   3. imagine you’re busting your heart to win and no one around you can carry your jock. Meanwhile you have delusional Russell Westbrook next to you who thinks and plays like he’s a top 5 player. Is the guy not allowed to be frustrated?   4. He could have signed the max not only For the money but to actually build something in Washington. They could’ve sold him on their vision and Washington was frisky with him and John wall for a couple seasons there.
Only John Wall would flex on beating the Wizards.  John Wall is a joke and belongs right where he is.  Him and Beal are complete morons and will always be on teams that suck.
"&gt;I think maybe they could’ve gotten rid of John Wall for some assets (even if those assets aren’t that good just to get rid of that contract)  This is delusional.  If they could have, they would have.  Theres a reason they had to give up a pick to get *Westbrook.*"
"I keep seeing people say John Wall, but I’m looking at the stats, and are pretty underwhelming. I understand he’s been out 2 years. But it still doesn’t change the fact he has only had 1 good game out of the 5 he has played, and 2 pretty mediocre at best. So I’m not exactly understanding why people are saying he’s balling... when he’s really not"
I also want people to think about this. Michael Jordan was in a terrible position for 5 years when he couldn’t make it out of the first until his team built around him (drafting Scottie and their other moves).   The problem isn’t his team being bad. But it’s the lack of vision for the future. The Westbrook trade has done more harm than good and I feel as though they could’ve gotten a better trade out of John Wall
Definitely john wall
Hes prob going to need a full year to evaluate. John Wall was an athletic freak so I understand him being good coming back but Boogie look like a gramma out there lol
John Wall
I think it’s both Conley and John Wall. Conley looks a lot like he did in Memphis. For Wall to come back after a torn achilles and still look really good for a player who’s athleticism is a huge part of his game is really impressive.
Definitely has to be John wall. He was out extended time so people automatically wrote him off but he’s balling out there.
"It's weird, but I miss the Oilers, so I fucking love it. I pretend John Wall to Christian Wood is Warren Moon to Earnest Givins, and I'm whisked away to childhood.  Luv ya Blue forever. We still fucking *love* the Oilers."
The success of KD and John Wall makes me wonder if they hold Klay back much longer...
"""At least my teammates like me dickhead"" - John Wall (maybe)"
Houston got blue jerseys this season because John Wall is crip-affiliated as per a friend of mine
"You’ll be hard pressed to find professional ball dominate player who does not get better after two of three years of being the point man. It’s not rocket science.   The stats can say anything, but are you making the people around you better? No? Take your 40 and get bounced out 4-1 in the playoffs.   Beals situation is different. Washington is a revolving door of players. Who’s he building chemistry with? The best player he’s played with any longevity was John wall and they traded him away.    We hear about the superstars who can force trades. Then we get the second tier of Supermax player that gets by with performance incentives but isn’t a brand the way beard and eyebrows are.   Beal has no leverage and if someone looks it up, he’s probably had 100+ teammates in Washington, none as good as Wall. If you wanna ball and just chill, Washington wizards is a good spot. 200 mil in the bank ain’t that bad"
"John Wall was the driving force of those teams tho   meanwhile Ray was in the ecf, went to 7, outplayed Iverson by a mile in the ecf, probably got screwed from getting to the finals   and then was leading another team to 52 wins, went 6 with the champs in the spurs, and that's with Rashard missing 3 games  as the guy, Ray accomplished much more"
John Wall liked this
Russ has had a better career tha John Wall by far.   Wall could’ve had the same trajectory or even better but his injuries fucked him up.   John Wall is currently better than Russ.   See how nuanced it is?
So awesome to see John Wall coming back in all star form despite his injury
What do you think John Wall would think of this comment? Do you think he'd be proud?
"""As Bradley Beal stands with his former teammate, in John Wall, against the hellish fiend that forcefully tore them apart, Russell Westbrook. It was clear Beal despised his new teammate."""
"John Wall hadn’t played for awhile. It was Beal’s team so doesn’t make sense for him to try and get wall traded, especially since John is a pass first guard compared to Westbrook. Never heard of him wanting wall traded"
"Uhhh, it's not like there was really much contention for the first overall pick that year. I mean yes some good players came from that draft but John Wall was one of the most obvious first picks of all time.   John Wall, was going to be the first pick in the 2009 draft if he was found to be eligible, it only sky rocketed seeing him show off in college with basically 17-4-7-2-.5 a game seeing his incredible athletic ability in college on top of him showing his handles/passing/etc it was a forsure pick."
"&gt;mahimi  This. That Wiz team was full of guys  that at their peaks looked a-okay for brief moments, but overall, they were mediocre players at best. No one on that team was making guys around better. And John Wall leadership was limited to flashy plays and bursts of speed. Sure, that Wiz team was slept on and managed to turn the season around. But IT-led Boston disposed of Wiz quickly. And it's not like these Celtics back then were a powerhouse either"
"Circumstances change. Even as recently as two months ago, i would've laughed at you if you told me that John Wall would demand a trade."
"Why does Beal not get a pass but other NBA stars do?  Anthony Davis, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, etc.  All these guys demanded trades out of their organization.  It's quite obvious the Wizards have done little to put their team in a position to contend.  I mean John Wall comes back and they make a pretty lateral move to trade him for Russ.  If I was Beal, I'd be upset with the organization, and the Wizards should absolutely trade him before they lose him for nothing."
"Agree with OP.  If Beal wanted to win, he should had learnt how to co-exist with John Wall.  They made the semis and were 1 game frm ECF early in their careers and regressed every year.  If they had built on what they had, they could had been the powerhouse of the East."
"Westbrook always has the best genuine rivalries imo, but props to John Wall for admitting Russ was the better player"
"I agree with this completely!!!. EVERYBODY EATS is out the door. Fans just wants all the best players on four teams. John Wall was the ""alpha"" on this team and the engine of the Wizards."
"And media pundits who want him in big markets.  Talk to any espn outlet and they'll tell you Devin Booker wants out of Phoenix, yesterday.  Talk to Devin Booker and he'll tell you he wants to spend his career in Phoenix. Shit, you can't even use the ""Sarver bad"" argument to say he'll get pushed out because Booker is like one of the few Suns (much like Nash) who has a fantastic relationship with the owner. You can point to LMA, John Wall, but that's not a fair comparison when Booker is much closer to Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal than he is to either of the aforementioned.  Same crap with Beal, Lavine, and I promise if the Mavs don't put together a .650 team around Luka, he'll be the next subject of criticism. Hell, people still expect Dame to want to leave when he's dropping 50+ in losses as if his entire team isn't out for injury."
Man John Wall is so entertaining to watch. His lockout hoopmixtape years back was a banger.
Exactly. People forget that we were a perennial playoff for years before Wall got hurt. He didn't expect to sign the extension and then suck the entire time.   He signed the extension thinking that the Wiz could maybe grab the 8th seed last season (close but no cigar) and then we'd have a healthy John Wall back to compliment him and make another run.    The front office failed Brad. He was just acting loyal.
Jerami Grant is way more than just a role player  Mike Conley isn't washed  Luka plays D and has a mid range game  Jaylen Brown and Tatum might be 1A and 1B  John Wall is still pretty good  SEXLAND
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
Makes them DIFFERENT not makes John Wall better.   westbrook 23-8-7 on 46% EFG ball dominant freak athlete point guard with a weak jumper  Wall 19-9-4 on 46% EFG ball dominant freak athlete point guard with a weak jumper  theyre very similar players
"I mean you sign a deal with John wall as your point guard, he goes down and is eventually traded for a Russell Westbrook, who isn’t bad, but does need to play hero ball and every opportunity, a Front office who doesn’t make bad or good signings &amp; has average drafts.... Yeah free Beal"
I'm shocked that the guy whose leadership skills were honed by John Wall turned out to be a me-first player who is trash at locker room leadership.
"John ""Teach me how to dougie"" Wall"
lucky to be top 30? idk man... i can be very critical of our players — and ive watched many many games over the last few years — but john wall has impressed me. imo he’ll easily be top 25 in a couple weeks when he’s built chemistry and is (hopefully) not missing games due to injury.
It's not as extraordinary as that. The Wizards wanted to move on.  John Wall was transferred. That's the NBA business.  Good for John Wall that he can play as well again.
Shoutout the realest blood John wall
I would rather have John Wall on my team than Westbrook
Who was lol. John wall was never done. Fuck you people are idiots
"That’s tough, I’m really hoping for the sake of fans that these front offices stop discounting these veteran players that they think are burnt out. How many more vets need to have career resurgences until front offices around the league start catching on? I think it’s absurd how many people questioned Steph this past year, obviously Lebron is doing incredible things for his age, Dwight Howard in LA this past season being a main piece on a championship team at 35, and now John Wall being another good example. Players will let you know when they’re done, a great way to piss them off is to assume they’re done before they’re good and ready."
"John Wall is a known sweetheart of a man. His relationship with little Miyah was the sweetest thing, his reaction to her dying made it pretty obvious what kinda dude he is."
Dude John wall zoomin every time gives me drose ptsd. Plz take care of yourself Optimus dime
John Wall is half right. He was able to prove at least tonight that he isn't washed up as a player. However the Wizards had to move on from him because it was very clear that Wall and Beal had a very low ceiling and that wasn't even a playoff lock.
"Dude I remember when John Wall was at Kentucky 😭 now they talking about ""vintage"". What the hell."
I thought it was a bad trade for Washington but every podcast I listened to was telling me the opposite. I guess I just thought a healthy John wall was better for your team than a healthy Westbrook. Turns out Westbrook is not really healthy and John wall is completely healthy.
"John ""MJ ""I Took it personal"" "" Wall"
That comes with John wall unfortunately. He thinks he's a better 3pt shooter than he is.
"hate to be that guy, but john wall plateaued very young. didn't look like he had a lot of effort to get better after he got paid also. this means nothing to me."

This clip reminded me of it and I wanted to post it but its like its been wiped from the internet. Can't find it anywhere.  Edit: Found it https://imgur.com/TJbmI66 Wasn't John Wall
Peak John Wall &amp; Peak Boogie was the dynamic duo we didn’t know we needed until we got it too late.
"Nice nitpick, trying to skip around the obvious point about Wood and Oladipo. I know it must suck to be blown out by John Wall and the Houston Washed, UDFAs and Backups."
That reason is that John Wall is a great point guard that can pass him the ball in good spots to score.
Lol 4 games ago dude went insane  He’s having a rough game. Calm down and enjoy John Wall lmao
"John wall back, no Tingis, bring on the pain!"
"John Wall, whose full name is Johnathan Hildred Wall Jr., has a brother named John Carroll Wall Jr."
Off the top of my head:   Thunder got CP3 for Westbrook. Good deal.   Pacers for Olidipo for Paul George.   Rockets Injured Westbrook for Injured John Wall
Westbrook ?   Mike Conley ?    Kevin Love ?  John wall ?   Plenty of bad contracts that could be moved .
"Definitely I watched highlights of: this game, the 60 vs Indiana, and the 10 straight 3s against the Lakers and really was just in awe because Klay, Steph, and Dray just meshed so well from 2015-19 (w/ KD ofc being there for 3 yrs)  The back to back injuries really are just terrible and speaking of KD: seeing guys like him and John Wall hoop only gives me hope that Klay Thompson at least comes back on a decent level next szn"
John Wall rn: https://www.instagram.com/p/CKSnv8CHHuL/?igshid=1gl7z4eachjbi
One lightly used John Wall?
boogie is only getting 2.3M so it's not a huge loss for the rockets  john wall getting 41M is a big deal if he's only playing half the games  sad thing for boogie is that he was a top center but was never able to get the big contract before injuries so his career earnings is lower than it could've been (not saying he's hurting bad with 88M or anything)
&gt; all stars like John wall and oladipo  when were these guys last all stars?
John wall is untradeable
"They aren’t superstars but, all stars like John wall and oladipo should be shipped out soon. The rockets look like they’re heading into a “tanking” season"

Post injury John Wall.
I would take a bullet for John Wall
We have 0 contracts on book for 2024 besides Kenyon Martin Jr who makes 2 million and those last 2 years are non guaranteed. John Wall expires in 2023 and Gordons contract is non guaranteed. From our rookie salaries and depending on where our picks land lets assume we have 35 million spent on rookie contracts with all of our draft picks which is a highball estimate btw and it could be much less. We would have roughly 86 million in cap space for 2023-2024 offseason
"Ok but all that doesn’t change that Westbrook has been straight up bad this year. TS of 50%, league average is 57 so that’s -7%   He’s taking the least amount of shots at the rim in his career and 51% of his shots come from midrange where he’s a 39% shooter. He’s barely breaking 30% from three   What’s he giving you besides penetration and passing? Nothing really and that’d be fine if he weren’t taking so many bad shots   Off the court it seems like the young wiz guys really like him so that’s something he brings but on the court it’s just not there anymore, there’s a reason he was traded for John Wall"
Maybe not the best but prime John Wall in transition was a sight to behold
He was #2 in the John Wall draft IIRC.
"A John Wall situation would suck, [but he had a much longer injury history, to be fair.](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/timeline-john-walls-injury-history-washington-wizards)"
"That’s fair, but I just see the sentiment that Klay’s situation is more similar to KD’s where he came back at like 90% when it’s really closer to John Wall if anything"

"Well he would’ve never had an Achilles injury. I think before that the fandom and everyone in the warriors org was assuming he’d be back at 100 percent. ACL injuries aren’t the death knell they used to be. My concern is we have like 3 case studies in the past 15 or so years on back to back major leg injuries, and none of the outcomes are great. There’s Demarcus cousins, who became washed very quickly and is playing on 10 days now; John wall, who is probably the best case scenario and is playing better than people realize in Houston but clearly isn’t the player he was 4 years ago. And then there’s Michael Redd who tore his ACL twice and was forced to retire and he’s also the closest to Klay’s build. I love Klay so much, but honestly he’ll never be what he was. He will probably still be good on offense and I’d be shocked if he isn’t still an amazing shooter, but he’s going to be a shell of himself on defense and will more than likely hurt the warriors in that regard. Hiding both members of your backcourt typically isn’t a winning strategy."
[Avery Bradley and John Wall pop out of the tank]
Can’t even get 50 smh trade him for John Wall.

Trading for Simmons is guaranteeing that they lose their protected 1sts, being a bad but not league worst team, and then having 2 years to convince Simmons to stay after wall expires."
"Houston Rockets really traded Russell Westbrook and James Harden for...... John wall, kelly Onlyfans, and 5 draft picks. Pathetic."
Yeah I can agree with that but he’s russel Westbrook even playing bad he’s gonna warrant a lot of attention from defenses and he’s still an upgrade over never playing John wall
Is John wall not an all star?
The team is much better to watch without John wall shooting 20 plus times a game. If he would just play the Chris Paul role and take a backseat while focusing on facilitating that’d be perfect
Thanks I might cross post. My main concern w that sub is the Westbrook hate and love for John Wall. Pretty sure everyone else knows Westbrook is better than Wall.  Also there are so many Deni Avdija trolls on there claiming he's the next Luka and it's just shitty coaching. He's not that good lol even if you had Phil Jackson.
"&gt;A healthy KD doesn't snap his achilles on a crossover.   I mean, a lot of otherwise healthy players have snapped their achilles doing things that weren't any more challenging on the ankle than KD's crossover. Cousin's achilles was just him taking a couple of steps to get a rebound. Wes Mathews' was a normal acceleration. John Wall just slipped and fell in his home.  With the benefit of hindsight it sure seems likely that there was something unhealed about his prior injury that nobody noticed, but he didn't appear to be limited in any way pregame or on the court, and three sets of doctors approved the scans.  But I'm sure you know more than any of those doctors."
"I also don't what that to be a reality. KD's fun to watch, and so is John Wall, but if both started out looking fine but are having health issues again, that strikes fear for me regarding Klay's health going forward (I know this sounds selfish as a Warriors fan). I want to assume the best for Klay, but I don't quite buy the take that he'll be fine because he ""doesn't rely on athleticism"" and he's ""mostly a catch &amp; shoot shooter,"" while completely disregarding how much he runs off ball while changing directions, just like Curry does, to get open to do his catch &amp; shoot thing, as well as all the cutting he does to get open for layups. Not to mention if his lateral quickness is shot, he'll have trouble staying in front of his defensive assignments, which was one of his strengths."
"Rose def had over 40 inch vert. Ridiculous first step, agility, top speed, body control and leaping ability. The fastest player with the ball end to end ever, him and athletic prime Westbrook, honorable mention to John Wall. Rose was the most athletic PG I ever seen play, especially the 2011 and 2012 version of him."
"Ironically, the Rockets continue to play a less than 100% John Wall to help the tank"
Adam’s would be the worst if not for John Wall. He’s earning the same amount as Giannis this season lmao
Lol I Was gonna say Schroeder for his dirty moves on John Wall. But Kelly Olynyk takes the cake !
"Coming from a Rockets fan, you need to trust me when I say you don’t want John Wall. Kevin Love isn’t going to take 18+ shots a game and he’s actually a good shooter."
I’d rather have John Wall then Kevin Love despite the pay difference
John Wall and Kevin Love are the 2 worst contracts.
John Wall and it isn’t close
"Has to be John Wall right? Once he gets on a more team friendly contract, he’ll be coveted around the league imo."
Are you claiming you don’t want John Wall and his current/future contract on your team for the rest of his career???
"Tank commander John Wall is doing his job. Wizards still won't make the playoffs and Beal is leaving anyways. Russ is clearly better than Wall though, if that matters any."
"Yeah that was some hate due to recency bias, I miss prime John Wall, dude was nasty. Westbrook can be awful to watch on your team, only really been watching Thunder games this year so idk how he’s been over there but if I know anything I know it won’t amount to any wins that matter.   I always wanted Beal, and with Donovan being from Florida and his situation I always dreamed of getting him here somehow😂 Westbrook-Beal-Kd would’ve been something else  Those PG-WB teams were BRUTAL to watch."
No way John wall thinks that he’s till the man
"For sure, I think a lot of people saw CJ’s breakout coming, just didn’t expect it to be so rapid, following a relatively pedestrian second year.    But yeah, the potential was always there, he was a lottery pick for a reason. While the Duke upset gets a lot of attention, he was a beast from the jump. In 2010, he was named to the Sporting News NCAA All-Freshman Second Team. The first team featured John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Favors, Derrick Williams, and Xavier Henry. On the second team, CJ was joined by Kawhi Leonard, Hassan Whiteside, Alec Burks, and Elias Harris. Making that list was clearly a strong predictor of future success."
The one where John Wall in 2016-17 was averaging as many points and assists as Westbrook is this season on better efficiency and less turnovers while being all-defensive caliber
Oof you must be a new fan. Prime Wall was a pretty exciting player to watch also if I remember correctly he averaged double digit assists three years in a row. I think without the injuries John Wall would’ve had a pretty decent case of making the HOF.
I mean John Wall is still a negative asset at this point with his contract. If Klay comes back as Kyle Korver then he'll be a negative asset too. Paying non-all stars those kinds of contracts usually doesn't end well unless you're tanking.
"This is true with lots of players. People are really quick to assume a player is finished when they come back from injury out of form.   Happens with Lonzo Ball every time he returns from an injury and is slow to get back into his groove. His main knock is that he's injury prone IMO, but he's a fantastic player when he gets comfortable after an injury. I was really thrilled to see him come back strong after the recent hip flexor strain, especially since it's still bothering him.   I'd say something like that is happening with John Wall. He's not having a great year, but he did have a considerable amount of time off, and it's not like teams are getting ample practice time this season. It doesn't seem like he's been robbed of all his athletic gifts (he actually still looks very fast to me), so I think it's very possible if not likely that John Wall returns to being an All Star caliber player next year."
"There is precedent, and it’s John Wall, so yeah not the best precedent for Kay’s future outlook."
What about John Wall? This sub told me his career was over because he depends on speed. His first year back has been a relative success all things considered
They were stuck with Wall before. Russ is clearly a preferable player to John Wall.
"However what’s their alternative? Beal can’t handle the ball, and nobody plays defense. With John Wall they would be even worse.   If you’re honest, would you just rebuild or try to build a roster around Beal?"
"First I saw john wall having 3-8, he didn't chuck this game?? Then I saw his turnovers and yeah, still the best tank commander out there, worth every penny of his contract"
"I dunno, how good is John Wall with a sword? The average male height back then was like 5'4"" and I can't imagine an average soldier was anywhere near a fifth as fit as a prime John Wall, so he might just be out there wrecking dudes."
Klay to Houston for John Wall? heh
"a 2017-18 John Wall led Wiz team is most likely be a 6-9 seed, and a player with those types of numbers on a decent team usually has an 1 all-star - would be close ash"
Could a Pre-Achilles John Wall prevented the fall of Troy?
John wall was the 2nd best pg in the league in 2017.
What if we give you John Wall? I promise he’s still good. I promise.
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
Replace CP3 with turnover machine Westbrick and then replace Westbrick with an even worse John Wall and replace top 3 player Harden with future picks.  Oh yeah and replace Capela with midgets and let Ariza walk when he was a great fit.  And voila!!!!
"Harden forced his way out and they traded Russ for post-injury John Wall, when you lose a borderline top 5 player that your entire team is built around you tend to have nothing left"
"Westbrook is a negative asset. He's owed 130M over the next 3 years. Rockets were just able to make the trade because they took an even worse contract, John Wall."
Rockets fans aren’t enjoying the John Wall experience?
John Wall for Porzingis pls
The point could be delly or maybe current John wall
John Wall has 3.5 turnovers per assist.  I don't think that's a good thing
John Wall yikes
Do the Rockets really need John Wall?
"Yes... Like anybody else at that time, I was desperately hoping somebody would beat that Heat team, and so I would latch onto any team that in theory could have a chance, which is why I liked the Bulls at that time.  But honestly, give me any kind of argument as to why Rose would be better than any of those players? He might be a better scorer than some of them, but he's not a better passer than any of them, and he's a worse shooter than all except Russ.   It's not really an indictment against him, it's just we've seen a ridiculous gen of point guards this last decade. Great players like Lowry, John Wall, Mike Conley don't even sniff this discussion."
Now do John Wall.
"John Wall has two more years after this one of $44m and $47m, lol  Edit: Didn't see the part about being held back from being true contenders. But if you are going to mention Westbrook and Love, Wall must be mentioned as well"
Yeah Kevin Love and John Wall both exist.
"LOL. For real though, if you put Lebron and AD (from last year and in full health) on all the teams in the NBA with their existing rosters, are there any teams that wouldn't be championship contenders?  I think the worst teams right now in the East are probably Orlando and Detroit, but by being in East, I think they'd still be contenders with Lebron and AD though it would be tough now that Orlando has gutted their team.  In the West, Minnesota has talent so I think they'd be good, but maybe Houston? Even then, John Wall as the 3rd option with Christian Wood at center isn't bad."
"But you know better than anyone that John Wall is one of the best point guards of the last decade. I'm not saying Wiseman doesn't have the potential, but it's very unlikely that the he makes the same leap"
"Enjoy ur team surrender the pick to okc.   But dont worry, john wall is ur franchise player right?"
How are people saying no? He was supposed to be one of the great PF's and is not even close to the conversation. He did not reach reach his potential at all. Maybe people don't remember how big of a deal he was when he first got into the league. John Wall is also disappointing in the same way...they were good for like 4-5 years but ultimately made no impact on the league.
"he def needs more bulk to reach his elite potential.  he needs to be able to rebound which means box out.  to reach his full potential he also needs to be able to post up smaller players.  he can already drive past the slower bigs, but to be a matchup nightmare/ focal point on offense, he needs more strength and a back to the basket game.  Otherwise he'll disappear in some games- kind of like porzingis now.  there have been a number of players who have similar skill sets to where he is now- lanky wings who can pass and shoot.  to turn into an AS and winner, they need to bring defense (can be through rebounding), and offensive consistency through a varied skillset (he doesn't project to have the nowitzki or john wall uber-elite level single skill like shooting or explosiveness)."
"Hmm.. actually John Wall + Eric Gordon + Jerami Grant + Christian Wood + KAT is a very solid starting 5 with plenty of athleticism, shooting &amp; versatility. DLo, Terrance Ross, Ant Edwards, Malik Beasley coming off the bench gunning threes.. or Gary Harris and Otto Porter if they're healthy in this scenario  Idk about championship but it'd be a pretty nasty team in the East. Probably 4th seed ahead of Atl and behind Phi/Bkn/Mil"
These stats aren’t perfect but he’s:  - 369th in Win Shares  - 117th in VORP - 95th in Box +/- - 201st in RAPTOR  - 203 in RAPTOR WAR   John Wall is not a top 100 right now. It’s crazy to think he’s going to be paid over **$90M** in the next two seasons
top player named john wall that plays for the houston rockets and even then there might be an argument
He should get better just watching the game on the sidelines. Obviously not ideal but I think it was John wall who talked about how sitting and watching film like every day with Sam cassell really helped him. Point guard v center but some positives are there
"I think if he's willing to come off the bench and run some offense while the main ball handlers/creators are on the bench he'd help any team.  But when he doesn't have the ball he hurts your team. No spacing or defense. He's not John Wall with his off the ball movement but he ain't reggie miller either.  So if he thinks he's a 35 to 40mpg player in the playoffs, the gains he'd provide be lifting a second unit, I believe would be nullified by him hurting the first unit team.  There's also an opportunity cost if you sign someone like Derozan. Let says you need 18 mil a season to sign him. Wouldn any championship team want to spend that on Derozan or someone who fits with ""stars* much better like Conley or Lowry who can also lift a 2nd unit offense and fit along with stars cause they can shoot and defend and in lowry's case move well without the ball.  So in theory. If Derozan is willing to sign for the minimum and play 15 mpg in the playoffs he'd help any championship contending team.  If one or both of those things aren't true, he doesn't have a role on a championship contending teams."
"I think it has to do with (disclaimer: am Asian) Asians being called   deceptively athletic"" regardless of how athletic they actually are - I remember a post on here a while back on how Jeremy Lin was genuinely quicker/better than John Wall/some others in his draft class on certain draft combine measures as still being called ""deceptively athletic."""
"Idk, as great a shooter Hali is I’d rather have Hali run point because his vision and IQ are outstanding. His ceiling is sky high, I’m talking Luka level high. Turning Hali into a Klay Thompson lite to pair with Fox’ John Wall like tendencies would stunt Halis growth and waste his playmaking potential.  Fox is getting to the rack, playing more aggressive so his fg is higher now short term but I expect some regression. His ft sucks, and ft is considered the best proxy for shooting other than TS%. If Fox can become a better shooter the way Kobe did in his career, it’ll work else Fox will be on the John Wall trajectory. If I’m the kings, I’m watching closely how Fox’ shooting sustains over next few years and whether or not it stunts Halliburton’s growth. If you’re perennially losing and getting blown out year after year, at some point you gotta look deep inside and wonder if you’re part of the problem too (hi John Wall!!).   I’d try and start Hali and Hield in the backcourt and try to move Fox for an all-star wing or lethal rim running center. It will have to be via trade because no FAs will come to SAC."
John Wall is in rarefied air when it comes to the elite tank commanders
I raise you one John Wall.
"I remember the Heat announcing that it'd take a long time for Bosh to ever come back and people got used to that idea  And then one day was retired all of a sudden  Almost like a John Wall kind of situation, except he never come back  I might be misremembering, but you hate to see it no matter what"

"John Wall  Conversely, Bradley Beal as well"
Better: Marcus Smart  Worse: John Wall
Yup people are too short sighted. Simmons in the West would be a disaster especially when you are already stuck with John Wall. Do people on r/nba not realize that Simmons isn't even the 2nd best player on his team this season by every single advanced metric and his offensive game is the worst of his career in his 5th season.
gotta get u a proper tank commander like john wall.
John Wall deserved his contract tho.
"You are telling me this dude is more overpaid then John Wall? Get outta here, troll"
John Wall and Kevin Love exist
Counterpoint: John Wall
What metric did you use to determine each team's best offensive player? I don't really agree with John Wall on the Rockets as their best offensive player considering how much of a chucker he's been lately.
This is the best answer. John Wall is up there too
"Well tbh I have seen very little of Wiz and Rockets, but from what I have seen, Westbrook has had a lot of terrible games, and John Wall has had decent games for the most part.  I know Westbrook has played injured most of the season but still. Also John Wall has a worst team around him, considering Westbrook  has Beal at his side, while Wall has.... Injured Wood, and the Porter kid.  You can argue Westbrook has the worst coach tho."
John wall was never a top 3 pg at no point in his career
Call me craxy I think John Wall has been better than Westbrook.
He definitely is if you're comparing him to the alternative. He's better than the corpse of John Wall by quite a bit
Rockets losing the Chris Paul-Westbrook trade &amp; then losing the Westbrook-John Wall trade.
"Yes, second only to Klove and John Wall."
John Wall is the equivalent of the skinny Homer Simpson meme with the fat tied up in the back
john wall has to be up there
John Wall
Its harder to out yourself out there and take a chance on yourself elsewhere. The easy thing to do is wear the “loyalty” tag like a badge of honor. Sports has changed...ownership will dump him in a second if he turns into John Wall
Yeah but John Wall delivered a second round appearance.
John wall up there too
It's better to not play than play like John Wall
"John Wall is gonna get paid 170 million on his deal and so far has missed a full season, and only played 1000 mins this year. Also he is awful and injured again."
"John Wall is up there. 4 year 170m deal, last year was his first year of that contract which he missed entirely, and he has 2 more years after this season. Wall’s just been a huge negative on both ends of the floor this season."
John Wall. Not because he’s bad but because he thinks he’s good
"2 years removed from the nba = healthy? haha.  You have honestly never watched basketball prior to curry coming into the nba.  100% of players coming back from that injury never comeback being the same player as they left.  It will take Klay at least half the year to even get his wind back.  You want recent examples?  John Wall.  Not even close to what he was prior.  Gordon Hayward.  He was overrated to begin with, but hasn't come close to repeating his numbers from when he was with the Jazz.  And he on a bad team now too for which you usually an inflation in numbers, but we haven't."
12-70 Nets losing out on John Wall and getting Derrick Favors with 3rd pick too
"Single game definitely, but I think in a 7 game series there’s gotta be a combination that works even if they’re not in the same year. John wall Kentucky vs the process 76ers could be a series."
"John Wall was a legitimate top 5 PG that was a 6’4 beast, and was not already nearing 30. I love IT, but no matter what, you don’t try to lock up a near 30 year old 5’8 PG for over 30 million a year."
"To be honest 3rd or 4th options getting that type of money now a days.  His contract is still not great but terrible (ie Horford, John Wall, even Westbrook)"
what like y’all did w John Wall? Lol
That's why it is so easy to hate on Harden and John Wall at many points in their careers. They show amazing skills but often just dump the ball off and stand there. Worse yet then people point to their assist numbers. Guys that scramble off the ball create enormous amounts of offense with not stats themselves.
"There was a Lakers game a couple years back where John Wall mauled Lonzo mid air without even touching the ball, sending him crashing on to the floor no foul called and dudes on here were like “good block, great no call”"
"They largely do ask the GMs and other staff members. And they ask for phone records. Two things, ever notice how the league fines the teams? They basically slap small fines because they don’t have much evidence. It is most just he said she said. If you look at the GMs side, if they can take a $50k fine and force an agent to keep a player there, it is well worth it. The GM would save their job that pays in the millions. Agents already do stuff that the league “investigates” and does nothing about. And agents are private citizens, they don’t forcibly have to give up their phone records. So the league only gets the records from the GM, which they do now and have so little in them that the league doesn’t do anything to teams.  Want an example, the media knew Lebron was going to LA a year before hand. Everyone saw Rich Paul with the Lakers all the time. The Lakers vastly overpaid KCP. Tell me, did the Lakers get in trouble for that? What about Brooklyn with KD? When CP3 went from the Clippers to Houston, the deal got done within hours of them legally being allowed to talk. Anyone who has watch trade negotiations from start to finish knows that it takes days. Just getting the cap number right under the rules and reading through giant contracts take time. Again the league knows all this stuff and never punishes anyone. When the league actually does punish it is a ridiculously small fine because it is a token gesture for the fans.   So when an agent loses his career and career earnings, how much evidence is there really there? You would be opening the league to liable lawsuits. What happens when the court of law forces that agent to be reinstated? You think the agent is going to do favors for that GM?   And now let’s talk about the actual consequences of rule changes. When the league added the super max to keep franchise players from leaving, did it work? No in fact it hurt teams more. Teams traded away potential super max guys for fear they would be spending that much for one player. And even when it did work, you have examples of Westbrook or John Wall that were impossible to trade except for each other.   So do you now agree with me?"
"he plays bad defense and so does westbrook, kyrie, john wall, ja morant, steph, lillard, fox -- and no, trae is not some outlier, ststistically or by eye test"
I guess if you give us John Wall that’ll help the tank more.
"This.  The Lakers and Nets absolutely wouldn't have traded for those guys.  What are the Lakers possibly trading that would make sense to take on a $30 million Drummond lol.  I'm sure the Clippers would have LOVED to trade for John Wall, but having to give up 5 rotation guys to shore that up isn't exactly an option, but if Wall was bought out, you better believe they'd murder anyone in their way to sign him."
"10 years? John Wall was drafted 10 years ago, thats enough time to develop, have your prime, then be washed up."
John Wall and the 5th Tank Battalion aren't blowing out any playoff teams missing just one injured player (D'Lo). I do not know how you can put frills on that but it seems like reality to me.
LOL oh yeah if Rachel Nichols says it it must be true. You’re literally tanking. Currently. On accident. And your GM is lying. To make you feel better. Thank god you got a real dude like John Wall because D Lo or Steph would just peace out of that trash pile 😂
John wall
"lol Boogie and John Wall, getting all offended and their feelings hurt because a perennial MVP candidate wasn't going to coddle them and pretend they were elite championship players.   Wall now eats his dinner while laughing at interviewers during post games for games he either openly tanked or is so terrible that he just loses games outright and nobody seems to think he's doing it on purpose."
John Wall *and* Victor Oladipo.
Yeah he’s on the Westbrook/John Wall train already because he is an inefficient shooter from deep
Forget John Wall. DJ Augustin is my tank commander
Tank commander John Wall is off duty today
no john wall fucking up our %s and us hitting  contested shots regardless. nets defense kinda doesnt matter right now
John Wall cheesing on the bench
John Wall our tank commander
Rockets without John Wall= Best team ever assembled
1. we look better without john wall 2. i do not feel safe with any lead
"I think his IQ is much higher than we can know. The problem with Westbrook is not his IQ, it's simply that his teammates have a hard time understanding the game the way he sees it. That's why he has to be the game plan. Whereas LeBron, he can explain and teach what he sees. So LeBron is def on a tier on his own because nobody can do what he does. But the tier below, I think Russ has his place. He has a higher bbiq than Kyrie and John Wall when comparing PGs IMO. Lower than CP3 and Lowry though."
"I mean clearly you haven’t been watching nba or maybe you aren’t the brightest in the room. Westbrook was playing through injuries until about last month. This week he has been playing great, set a record but John wall out here leading his team to 12 wins shooting 30 shots and scoring 20 while being fully healthy."
Dense lol literally everything about Westbrook is better then John wall. Wizards would probably have 2 wins right now if wall was on the wizards. Dudes shooting 30 shots and scoring 20 points.
"Biggest additions probably Gordon Hayward for the Hornets and Chris Paul for the Suns, biggest losses John Wall for the Rockets and Steven Adams for the Pelicans"
my dream of john wall in a laker uni might come true but he ain’t gettin bought out lol
"Yo, we literally prefer George Hill over John Wall. His passing isn't anywhere near it used to be, he's shooting like 31% from 3 and he's washed. Super sad to see that, I liked John during his Washington days a lot, game winner against Celtics was HYPE"
"Lol I'm with the pelicans front office... you don't get to choose where you go, this ain't fantasy land. This is a business and i feel like cutting you I cut you, if i feel like sending you to Minnesota for a bag of chips then so be it. You signed the contract, go ahead and retire. Vise versa, give me a big contract that you regret like the wizards gave Otto Porter Jr/John wall and the wizards didn't complain about money not well spent. Keep it pushing end of story."
"Luka, Wall, Lillard.   Those three easily would take John Collins on their team to be in contention for second best player on their rosters."
Man the guy has been considered a superstar year after year since KD left and he's consistently shit the bed everytime in the playoffs. The guy played with PG and Harden but couldn't make an ything out of it. He then got traded to the Wizards to play with Beal and replace an absent John Wall...... and the team got worse with him on it. The Thunder traded him and PG away and got better the next year with an extremely old CP3 leading the charge.  Russ is disappointment personified in the league.
"i mean John Wall has been atrocious. if you watch him you can see he settles for jumpers and can't finish at the rim and can't blow by guys like he used.  I thought KD was gonna be the one to break the curse but the way he's been out with hamstring injury and the Nets secrecy, I don't doubt it has something to do with the achilles.  i don't think it matters how much time you have to rehab. aside from Nique who practically changed his whole game, guys never return the same. either they can't play the same minutes they used to, can't play their same style or can't stay healthy."
"Boogie returned 352 days after he tore his Achilles, when normal players who rupture their Achilles aren’t given more than 300+ days to get back on the court to play. The two most recent examples, Kevin Durant and John Wall were given an extended period of time to recover because of the suspension of the 2020 season hence why they’re closer to who they were before in terms of level of play. In that sense, the Warriors handled his return timeline pretty well.  Then Cousins tore his quad in Game 2 of the Clippers series and was supposed to be out for the rest of the playoffs. Then he came back in the Finals, averaged about 18 minutes per game and showed glimpses, but you could really tell he wasn’t moving that well on both ends. I think you could argue he was rushed back in that series, although Cousins wasn’t moving all that well in the regular season as well."
"I think you’re underrating Simmons, he doesn’t need a perfect roster to be an effective player. Even last year with our cramped roster, he was our best player for most of the year and was 2nd in the league in 3-point assists. He plays well as a main facilitator and better when he was other guys to take some of that load off him. Porter’s a better shooter than he’s shown and Simmons/Tate defending on the wing is scary.   I don’t think the Rockets should be making long-term personnel decisions based on how they fit with John Wall, but idk. Simmons would’ve nice with Wood imo."
He’s gonna go after John Wall?
"I mean the Nets picks for the near future aren't really worth anything and, with Sean Marks as GM, none of the pick swaps are likely to convey. And then the Sixers deal might have fewer picks, though I'm not even sure about that, but you're probably still getting the far future picks, which are probably about as likely to be lottery picks as the Nets picks. And you can still tank as well. Simmons and Wall is about the worst basketball fit imaginable, and presumably John Collins is the only young player you could take back that would win you a meaningful amount of games.   Are you just going to say no to more picks + young players just because the second group of picks might not be that high?"
The disrespect. John Wall played 40 games in 2018. The Wizards were a under .500 team even when he played.  Bradley Beal has never sniffed being an all-nba player while Derozan was 2nd team all-nba that year.
John Wall has never easily been a top 3 point guard
"I mean Steph Curry has insane technique. He couldn’t have put the thousands of hours of dribbling and shooting a basketball into dribbling and shooting a soccer ball and made himself a successful soccer player? What about Chris Paul? Dame? Kemba? John Wall? De’Aaron Fox?  It’s just impossible for me to imagine that a great point guard’s speed, body control, acceleration / deceleration, footwork, leaping, strength to play through contact, etc wouldn’t translate. Obviously the ball skills still need to be developed from a young age, but the same goes for basketball and all these guys achieved that."
"Assists per game is a bad way to say someone is a better play maker John wall and Westbrook average more career APG than Lebron. The difference was Lebron can score an efficient 27 ppg, Jason Kidd peaked at averageish 18 ppg scorer so obviously he’d pass more as that was the better option."
"We have John Wall, I think that’s enough bricking for one team.  The Nets deal isn’t much better but it has wayyy higher upside.  I don’t see Simmons getting us even to the conference finals in the West with budding Fox, Booker, Mitchell, Luka, Jokic, Zion."
"He didn’t tank lol. He averaged 26/6/10 on 61% TS for us in 8 games, is that tanking?  He didn’t want to waste anymore time playing on a team that owes John wall $40 million, he did what needed to be done"
"Remember DeMarcus Cousins? Or John Wall? Or Derrick Rose? Or Kobe? One injury is unfortunate, but two major injuries within a year and it's pretty much a done deal. Klay will have to be the first player in NBA history to make it 100% back off of two career-altering injuries. I want Klay to come back but just plugging your ears and singing seems tone-deaf to how bad his situation really is."
John Wall is a 52% TS player and makes $40 million a year.
"Loyalty doesn't exist. Blake was loyal, Demar was loyal, John Wall was loyal. Still got traded."
John Wall sucks
"couldn't he have just received Caris LaVert, Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen.  Jarrett Allen is a franchise cornerstone center for a team to build around. Between him and Caris those two could've easily netted them a SGA type player or a whole bunch of picks. Jarrett Allen is going to be so valuable as a RFA, so many teams will throw him money. The entire deal with Cleveland and Indiana to land Oladipo was so stupid, did Tillman really think that Oladipo was going to have value as a star coming off an injury? I guess he loves picking up injured former stars considering he has John Wall (which is now looking like an absolute savior for DC that we got rid of him)"
Fox reminds me of john wall
But they’d buy out John Wall or Love? Lol
Kevin Love: Malibu  Westbrook: Clippers   John Wall: Glue Factory  Al Horford:  Lakers/Warriors/Heat
"I could see KLove on Clippers, Blazers, Bucks, and Philly.   John Wall in NYK  Al back to ATL?   Westbrook stays in WAS"
Kevin Love- Timberwolves  John Wall- Wizards   Al Horford- retires and takes up crocheting  Russell Westbrook- Thunder
"I fully understand that reading can be hard.  Verbatim, I said, ""(Lowry) would rank him 7th, behind John Wall at 6."""
"John Wall? No way. Curry, CP3, Westbrook, Dame, Lowry, Irving are all in front of Wall and I'm probably forgetting some. Wall hasn't done much in the NBA."
"Lowry's prime easily allows him to enter the conversation, and personally I would rank him 7th, behind John Wall at 6.  (check my other comments for my full 5)"
lol what's the benefit of cutting John Wall? We need a tank commander. Also dude can still ball and possibly rehab his value around the league. I doubt we get a trade for him but he'll be expiring soon so it's not completely out of the realm either.
"Alright this is a bit much. He would absolutely tear it up on a better team. He’s a great leader, a walking bucket and clutch in crunch time. We have literally never seen him with a roster that wasn’t mediocre, especially compared to the other Western teams we’ve seen in the last 5-7 years. He’s been a top 3 PG in the league for the last 2-3 years and yeah him mentioning his loyalty and shit all the time can get annoying but he’s definitely way, way better of a player than like John Wall or Kemba who are getting similar pay in the same role.   He makes like 4 mill a year more than Kemba who is not even close to being as good of a player anymore. Pay structure lol they Kemba that 4/140 in free agency, you don’t think a player of Dame’s caliber deserves a max contract? I’m not even a Dame fan particularly, this is just a bad take."
So cut John Wall lol. Having Ben Simmons and no one else likely puts you in a better position than the Rockets are in now.
"I think that’s a solid option but it’s still not the path I’d choose.   Wood’s contract expires with John Walls. Thybulle becomes on RFA then too.   Simmons would have two left. And then you’re still missing 2 picks I believe.   The net is - if they’re trading for Simmons, who’d be under control for 5 years, and 2 late first....they’ve got to do good things during that window.   Personally, I don’t think the awkward pairing of Simmons and Wall taking up 70% of the cap leaves success during those 3 year as a likely outcome.   Getting seeded above the playing (Blazers currently 28-18) would seem like a stretch.   Then you could double down once it’s just Simmons and Woods, but again down two picks already, any move would really put you behind on assets. How much can they reasonably get?   I’m pro take your medicine. It’ll suck, but the other paths seem to draw out the pain."
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
He's the only one who's actually thought critically about the Rockets future. Everyone else is circlejerking about how the Rockets fans must hate not having Ben Simmons next to John Wall lol
"I really don't know what people are expecting, a Simmons + John Wall backcourt is going to be terrible but still not terrible enough to hit bottom so they'd have no chance at keeping their top 4 pick. The last 3 years of picks might end up really really good for the Rockets."
You wanted him to stay and play with John wall?
Yes the wall/Simmons pairing would’ve been a disaster. Obviously you don’t make future decisions based off John Wall but he is going to be stuck there for the next 2 years. So for 2 years you’d have Simmons completely miserable playing next to John Wall. John Wall is as selfish as they come. It’d be a disaster and Simmons would be left stagnated never being the primary ball handler.   The only way they could’ve gotten around that is if they did what okc did with horford and just benched him. But idk if Wall would agree to that.
"&gt;I don’t think anyone has ever expected any NBA player to start doing that. Steph was special from the start though. I won some nice money from his March Madness tourney  Zion Williamson, Tim Duncan, Shaq, LeBron, John Wall, Kevin Durant     For Prep to Pro, I would say LeBron was definitely the most apparent, then Zion then John Wall. Those are players I could have seen in High School just go straight to NBA and I would feel completely comfortable drafting them extremely high if it meant I would get shot in the back of the head if they weren't an all-star.     &amp;#x200B;  Shaq and Tim definitely showed during college, not so much during high school but idk if that is because of lack of broadcasting games in high school/college nationally so not AS much attention but they were definitely apparent in college.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  KD definitely showed in college, idk about High School. I'm not too informed."
"As someone who watched John Wall play like 200 times, he wasn't always the best at conditioning compared to other NBA athletes, but his injuries were mostly due to age catching up with his playing style. He had minor knee issues, foot/heel issues that got worse and worse, and all that contributed to his achilles. The guy's game was based on ultra-elite athleticism, and throwing his body toward the rim, that's gonna catch up to you once you get into your mid/late 20's."
"&gt; Kyle Lowry himself has admitted he was out of shape as hell when he first got to the league  Kyle Lowry was out of shape if you compare him to the NBA. These dudes are not getting injured because they're ""out of shape"", they're getting inured because they're playing a sport at superhuman speed. It's disrespectful as fuck to imply John Wall would just be fine if he only conditioned more. The dude is a professional athlete."

"Also dont forget they are stuck under that John wall contract for the next two years, and NOBODY's gonna bail them out of that Via trade without getting a shitload of valuable assets attached"
"Another great chucking performwnce by john wall. 2-12, dude is getting better and better at it"
This means all of you “wizards fans” that claimed the Russ / Wall trade was stupid &amp; because u wanted to keep wall are fuckin idiots...  if u one of them ppl that thought this trade was stupid either  1. Stfu forever  Or  2. Find a new team we don’t need u mediocre John wall sack holding loser Bums here
"It’s so lame when these guys throw gang signs. It’s like when Drake does his tough guy rapping and shit, like nobody believes you.   John Wall is making $38 million this year for playing a game. His life is more similar to Wendy Williams than to an average gang member"
gang sign john wall gonna make an appearance soon. y’all be sorry then. probably not but hey
John Wall max when healthy was a terrible decision as well
How long has Beal been on that team? And John Wall wasn’t doing this.
"yeah, that's absolutely true. You guys have to move beyond box scores as your sole means of understanding basketball. It's embarrassing. you know who WB's closest player comp is this year? John Wall."
John wall could never...
"he was never efficient in his career, its the same as Kemba. the league blew by these guys and they never adapted well. Conley improved his efficiency big time and plays good defense as always  Kemba is at career avg rn, bad contract  John Wall is at career avg rn, bad contract"
You’re right we should give it to John wall. Who else could lead a tank so well?
What does john wall have to do with pascal siakam...how you gonna talk trash about pascal when kembas contract even worse
Prime Wall and Beal right now or last year would easily make the ECF or the finals if they had a good supporting cast which I believe would've been acquired and built by having healthy All NBA level players on their team attracting free agents. They'd have the best back court in the league. John Wall was top 15 in the league at one point and could have continued to get better if not for injuries.
At his peak he was all nba 3rd team with a career high 54% TS that was still below league average. It was always an overpay the moment he got the max. John Wall got the max because of the situation the Wizards were in and having to overpay him. But he was never a top 10 player in the league and never worth the the super max.  And get out of here. Wall and Beal’s ceiling was in 2017 where they had a chance to make the ECF in a weak east and would have gotten mowed down by Lebron. Prime Wall and Beal was never good enough to make the finals let alone win it.
Klay not playing is better then John Wall.
"People forget how good prime John Wall was so quickly  The contract was not bad at the time and you can't not pay people out of fear of injury concerns imo, if Wall doesn't get hurt the Wizards probably win a title or at least make the Finals with prime Wall/Beal"
That’s tank commander John Wall to you
John wall?
"Pat bev for sure. I’d say John Wall too,  last year over Bled"
"This is completely coming from a homer/fanboy thing, but one of my favorite twists to this season would be if he keeps it up and validates the theory of the John Wall trade."
John wall was a man possessed that year good lord
"Was it a 100% available offer that the Sixers were willing to give up Simmons? If so, I would have just take Simmons straight up. John Wall can be traded for a shooter if he and Simmons don’t fit. Wood, Tucker, Gordon, Simmons, and Wall would have been cool."
Kinda sad. I know he wanted to play with John Wall for years. I was stoked to see them reunited in Houston.
Man thats some bullshit. The man was doing everything right and was playing with his college mate John wall. Now I know where draymond green was coming from.
"absolutely not. he asked for a trade in the offseason when Morey, MDA and Russ left.  Harden signed that contract extension under the assumption Morey and MDA would still be part of his organization and they were going to surround him with a championship caliber supporting cast to compete.  once they left he had no obligation to show up. you go back to Harden before he signs the extension and tell him ""2 years from now Morey and MDA won't be here and you'll be playing with Boogie Cousins and John Wall both coming off 2 year long injuries"" he wouldn't have signed that shit.  Harden needs to look out for himself and his career. just like Tillman looks out for his bottom line. did absolutely nothing wrong."
John wall is next?
"""I came here to play with John Wall"" in shambles."
What’s gonna happen to John wall?
"RIP to one of the Top 3 Bullets/Wizards players in history, WES UNSELD!  Westley Sissel Unseld or better known as WES UNSELD, ranks up with Elvin Hayes and John Wall as the greatest D.C./Baltimore mainstays in history. We can cover some of the famous feats like his Rookie-MVP season in 1969, or the championship ring he muscled his teammates to in 1978, but I'm going to cover his accolades making the team's age squad, in typical age-squad-guy fashion:  •	Wes is easily the best Center in franchise history. He is their best Center at the ages of ... 22-24, 26, 28-29, &amp; 32-34, and made the 30-31 squads as a 6th selection.  •	Wes is absolutely the BEST franchise player from the ages 22-24... let's highlight why:  •	In this period, Unseld received the MVP award in his rookie season, received the 8th most votes for the award the following season (1970), and then made his 2nd all-star game the year after (1971).   •	Wes racked up 31.9 Win Shares in his first 3 seasons (still age 22-24 folks). Of the 28 players to rack up more than Unseld in this span, only Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, and Wes have a majority of those win shares come from DEFENSE.  •	Usually with young stars, they are dumping out astronomical stats on cellar dwellers, but Wes' Bullets were 57-25 in his rookie season. By his 3rd campaign, they ran roughshod through the regular season at 42-40, but still ended up making the NBA Finals! (Unseld would make 3 more Finals after that).  •	The only player to put up better numbers during a similar age-frame was Walt Bellamy who played during the infamous 1962 surge and for a miserably failing Chicago Zephyrs team (where the Wizards originated).  •	John Wall, Phil Chenier, Chris Webber, Terry Dischinger, Earl Monroe, Bradley Beal, Gilbert Arenas, and Walt Bellamy are all special players for the Wizards in that particular age-frame, but none touch the Wide U."
"This wasn’t just dumb. It ruined everything. If they keep CP3 they would’ve been legit contenders last year and they might have been able to keep harden happier heading into this year. Oh, and they exhausted their draft capital which makes rebuilding extremely difficult. If they had their own pick rights plus the Brooklyn haul they’d be in fantastic shape. Plus, no John wall contract. And they could’ve gotten an extra 2 firsts for CP3 like the Thunder did. It was a devastating mistake. So bad, that morey actually DID resign to get out of it. I bet he wishes he resigned when Tilman asked for that deal. If Morey told Tillman, I’m out if you do this trade,, Tilman might have rather kept Morey than do the trade for Westbrook."
Fwiw I’m having a really hard time hating your current squad - love Wood so much and it’s damn hard to cheer against a team with John Wall on the roster
"Wow, so you deleted your first response since you didn't reply to him specifically. And now you comment the same thing again? Where's that John Wall gif when you need it?"
"Otto porter, John wall?"
"Anyone who thinks that sport was better and stronger 20, 30 years ago is too nostalgic and stubborn. Today's athletes are, in the true sense of the word, gladiators. Just look at the old videos and see how much today's players are generally with many more muscles on average. Only that aspect, and what about the accuracy of the shot, is incomparable. Today, John Wall or Towns are not even in the top 20 players at the moment, and if you put them in the nineties, they would break up the league, they would literally be in the top 7-8 players."
"No not really. While Rubio had a solid career for a no.5 pick or whatever it was, his hype was pretty huge. If I remember right, the Timberwolves drafted him at 18 KNOWING he was not eligible to play in the NBA (1 and done rule) so he was taken top 10 a year ahead of what should have been his draft class.  If he hadn't been drafted that year there's a good chance he goes #1 ahead of John Wall in 2010.   His hype was crazy after 2008. I mean he looked like the second or third best player on the floor at 16 years old against the US team. Think about that happening today. That prospect is gonna be hyped beyond belief if they show up against some of the best NBA players on the biggest stage at 16 yrs old."
"I was actually glad to see him play the Sixers this week. He had a big ol smile his face most of the game and just seemed to really enjoy being out there. He certainly doesn't look as athletic as he once did, but he's still a savvy player.  Him and John Wall on the comeback trail is a feelgood story."
Let John Wall do his thing until he's an expiring. Then you might have a shot at moving him for a pick. Other than that just keep on keeping on. Try to make a playoff spot I suppose. You have Wood + Wall so you should have a shot at the play in for the next few seasons. Then just hope Nets crater.
"It certainly will still be negative. Even guys like Wiggins and Harris who are making less and are playing well are still very well are negative contracts. John wall is the 4th highest player in the league and has 2 more years left. Not to mention he plays point guard, the most saturated position in the league. Most tanking teams already have their future PG and most contenders don’t have $40M in useless expiring contracts to even make a trade work, let alone hamstring any cap flexibility for 2 years.  The annual candidate to make a trade like that would be the Knicks but they’re not even making dumb moves like that. Only teams that will take Wall would do so for draft compensation. Look no further than Kevin Love who is making 25% less than Wall and still can’t get any takers."
John Wall seems like a really good teammate.
They didnt even give john wall a 10 game sample size or something wtf.
"Probably not. He’s probably got the potential of a Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf type career if everything breaks right for him lol. Doesn’t really belong in the tier of the true point guard superstars like Kyrie, Chris Paul, John Wall, Westbrook, or even Rondo. You know, guys who actually can be and were the clear cut main star guys for title winning teams..."
"Lol, also putting Lou Williams on John Wall was the precursor to CJ Miles on Love."
I mean John wall had the same 2 injuries as a guard that relies more heavily on athleticism than Klay and looks pretty damn good.
Crazy to think as a rookie he was the primary defender on John Wall his first series and Lebron for his 2nd.
It’s less about time and more about John Wall being traded
replace Kawhi with John Wall
Shit literally brings a tear to my eye! First Wizards All Star starter since John Wall
"He averaged basically the same points he's averaging right now with one fewer assist(still enough to lead the league btw) and his percentages were lower but still mostly near his career averages or better (his 3p% was down slightly).  He was at 61.3 TS% which is about 0.6% less than his MVP season.  I get there's that one John Wall pass that everyone talks about, but his lack of effort those last 10 games in Houston is hugely overstated"
Going for the deepest team cuz I’m building the team on 2k with no injuries and gonna see how it goes!  Starters: PG: John Wall ($15) SG: Klay Thompson ($16) SF: Demar Derozan ($13) PF: Christian Wood ($13) C: Nikola Vucevic ($17  Bench: PG: Terry Rozier ($6) SG: Collin Sexton ($14) SF: Andrew Wiggins ($9) PF: Julius Randle ($6) C: Clint Capela ($9)  Roster Fillers: Kevin Knox: ($1) Isaiah Thomas: ($1)
Facts. Then you watch him in his 2nd year and it was like “Oh.. he doesn’t fucking blow but he’s damn sure not John Wall”
"Kris Dunn had John Wall comps, anybody would have taken that. Ainge took Jaylen."
The Celtics also need his specific skill set and the gravity he provides. Someone like John wall just doesn’t help them as much as 75% of what Kemba Walker was. So yeah agreed the only real solution is roll the dice and hope he can get back to relatively reasonable form. It’s a gamble with the health but I don’t think a magically better option is appearing
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
"Good. Same as players do today. It’s good that players are invested in team success. The problem is today, organizations feel that they can invest everything in a guy and give him anything he wants, and he can still walk. Case in point, Harden. Sure, he gave Houston 8 years of amazing basketball. And I don’t really fault him for wanting out. But of course Houston is going to be left feeling high and dry. They gave him all the personnel he wanted for 8 years. CP3 didn’t work out. Russ didn’t work out. Small ball didn’t work out. They still tried to make moves for this year too. And at the end of it, they are left with a huge John Wall contract and probably not a chance at being competitive for at least another 5 years."
"Disagree. Wall, Tate and Gordon all played hard. Actually if john hadn't had as many TOs and a fairly sad first half we very well could have won it. But that second half he was a monster for sure. Just wanted the other two to get their due credit"
Imo banking on coming back by John Wall hitting three pointers is a fools errand
"My thoughts are: John Wall is still the man. Played hard every minute and was a constant, consistent leader on the floor at all times."
Really glad to see him and John Wall back together
Shoutout John Wall. Out basically two years and he's been awesome this season with the few games I've watched.
Good game. Missed the 3rd and half of the 4th because of rolling blackouts. John Wall is the man and the only reason this game ended up as close as it was.
"I straight up hated that 2nd half, but a win is a win. Coming off a 3 game losing streak and missing Ben Simmons, whatever. I'll take it. Loved the fight the Rockets put up and I'm so happy John Wall is fully healthy again."
Maxey wouldn't get a whistle if John Wall stabbed him with a machete
John Wall always has a face like he just smelled a fart
John Wall.
"Right: John Wall can still play at a fairly high level. Not to the level of 2017, but playing much better than the 2018/19 season.   Wrong: That he and Beal would play as teammates"
"Unfortunately, John Wall. Missing so much of his prime hurts him a lot, while other PGs of the era were playing some great basketball, and younger studs have entered the league.   He doesn't have an ECF appearance, but Wall has been a damn good playoff performer.  I think he could be salvaged, if somehow Houston becomes a contender, or if he gets to one soon, to create more memorable moments.  My other choice is Marc Gasol"
"The john wall comeback/trade being better for rockets than 'Zards I was right about. Ironically, i though KD was gonna look nowhere near where he is.  So wrong there, although i will also hedge that and say let's see what it looks like after a whole season...  But so far wrong yes."
John Wall
"Thinking of college, imagine if you had your college starting 5.   &gt;	Kentucky can roll out a:   &gt;	Fox/SGA/Booker/Anthony Davis/KAT starting lineup   &gt;	With: Bam, John Wall, Cousins, Randle, Murray on the bench."
"They didn't ""lose"" John Wall, they traded him away"
"What's funny about this whole thing is you have people like OP caping for liek .1% of the league who pulls this shit. And every single time, it's players at the tippity top who are demanding trades and acting out. I feel bad for players like Shaun Livingston, Deron Williams, Brandon Roy, John Wall, or Jahlil Okafor. Players who actually suffered because of the game, but stayed professional and ran with what they got."
What future does Houston have without Harden? John Wall &amp; Cousins?!? 💀😂😂😂
"It's not that it would necessarily be wrong. Bradley Beal of all people would probably have the general public's sympathy, with the way the Wizards have been run, how much has he has grown despite numerous bad HC's coming through, and now with the trade of John Wall.  But the fact that he has just put his head down and continued to work on his game is worth commending. That's all the other guy meant."
Absolutely loving the John Wall comeback tour. Think it’s fairly safe to say he’s earned his way back in to top 10 status
"Gotta love the revisionist history after the Rockets traded him lol. This entire sub was (rightfully) calling him the worst contract in the NBA; or at least one of the two behind John Wall.  But yeah, I think a big part of why the Harden/CP3 relationship went downhill was because of CP3 looking washed. I think there was a report of Harden getting annoyed about CP3's bickering and thinking ""dude, you can't even beat your guy off the dribble anymore""  Imagine this version of CP3, plus the picks they would've kept to go after a 3rd piece."
The answer is john wall. He was really close to having his foot cut off
John Wall was close to having his foot cut off. On top of the ACL and achilles injuries.

"Teams lying to players? [We recently had John Wall claim the Wizards lied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/01/26/john-wall-wizards-lied-to-me-about-trade-rumors/) to him about a possible trade. Andew Bogut [claims the Lakers lied to him](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/andrew-bogut-says-the-lakers-lied-to-him/) about cutting him.

But certainly part of that is lying to players."
"I'll never forget the summer we were supposed to get John Wall and Lebron, but ended up with Travis Outlaw and Johan Petro."
everyone always got mad at him because he's a partier and the hang signs shit but he seems like a really good dude who tries to be a leader for the team. always been a big fan of John Wall and I think it sucks that he hasn't been appreciated for how good he was.
Leave our man John Wall alone. That dude is a hero in DC.
"This game was John Wall, Google's corpse, and players that wouldn't get minutes anywhere else.  Get healthy please Houston :("
John Wall is John Wall
Someone pls give me an edit with “do the John wall” playing
Can you imagine if this team had a PG like... John Wall.
I love John Wall
People will never realize how important John Wall was for the community.  Dude got a spot on Ben's Chili Bowl wall for a reason.
John Wall plays basketball like he just came back from meeting with Old Testament God.
John Wall being back is awesome
"While I concede that you can't be argued as *the best* without stuff like that, you can be an all time great by contributing what star players lack. Emotion, leadership, *grit* and all those intangibles everybody raves about. You can be lack talent (by NBA standards) and have other things to offer.  It's why I love IT, Kemp and Marion. It's why in 20 years I'll rave to my kids about CJ, Blake, John Wall and Derek Rose. I try to remember these guys are humans and I'd rather build people up for what they did rather than tear them down for what they did not.   If i retired as a well paid controller of a successful company, it would be offensive to say ""well he could have been CFO if he worked more."" It's OK to be middle of the pack and when you're in a group as exclusive as the NBA I'm still down to celebrate players who make the Hall of ""Pretty God damn good""."
I thought that first clip of rook John Wall was GTA San Andreas
"Why can’t John Wall put up 18 points in the first 15 minutes every night? Just adds fuel to the thought that certain players can just turn it on whenever they feel like it, but otherwise just play for the paycheck. I understand there are extra emotions involved being back where he played for years, but it’s obvious he can still play at a high level so why shouldn’t he do that every game?"
May John Wall play well and the Wizards get the W
John Wall video tribute!
John wall is a bad player
"Prove you’re the better pg, John Wall!"
"That never happened. John Wall got injured during the regular season for some games (when Beal did play very well) but was healthy in the playoffs. In Washington's two wins he played 36 and 43 minutes, and averaged 26 points and 12 assists for the series.  Beal actually fouled out in game 4 after playing really well with about 4 minutes left and Wall closed the deal for the Wiz without Beal"
John wall plz go off
Wizards might have a fighting chance unless John Wall goes supernova
"That's relative to other basketball players though. I can't name a single NBA player who seriously competed in track and field in high school or college.  John Wall said he ran a 4.5 (which wouldn't have even been accurate, a hand-timed 40 is always 0.14 - 0.20 seconds fast) and he was one of the fastest guys in the NBA.   Nate Robinson is basically the only recent player who has a document 4.4 forty, and he was a football player growing up plus his 3/4 court sprint time was by far the fastest in NBA history."
John Wall got new life.
And Beal hasn't even played in the playoffs and when he did was a clear second option to an elite playmaker in John Wall
"If he gets traded to the Raptors, I want a follow-up video at the end of the season.  I think it's bananas that out of the top 20 players with the most turnovers, he's in there while averaging less than 30 minutes per game. Everyone else in the top 20 averages more with John Wall barely scraping over 30 minutes while handling the ball. He's pretty much a guaranteed turnover every 9 minutes or so while being a center who isn't the focal point of the offense. It's unfathomable to me that someone averages more turnovers than assists in less than 30 minutes a game while not being a versatile part of the offense.  What a waste."
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30439266/sources-houston-rockets-washington-wizards-agree-russell-westbrook-john-wall-deal   The 2023 first-round pick is lottery protected for the Wizards. If it doesn't convey in that year, it has a succession of protections that include picks Nos. 1-12 in 2024, picks 1-10 in 2025 and picks 1-8 in 2026, sources said. If it hasn't conveyed as a first-round pick to Houston by 2026, it becomes a second-round pick in each of 2026 and 2027, sources told ESPN.   So yes, if wizards stay bad through out the next five years, it becomes two 2nds.  Also note, this means wizards can not trade their frp picks until 2026.... which is pretty crazy if you think about it."
I think Al Horford's contract is awful but he's rehabbing his trade value silently in OKC and some desperate contender will try to go for him.  Most supermax contracts are ass (Russ and John Wall). Kevin Love's is also particularly bad. At least Otto Porter Jr is an expiring.
"I guess John Wall. He missed the entire first year of it, and will be getting paid $47m in 2023. He’s not bad at all, but I’m not sure if he will get to $47m form and this leaves the Rockets in an interesting place since it’s a near untrade-able contract"
"Rose just wasn’t built well enough to withstand it.  Some guys just can’t do it for long.  John Wall in the modern era.    Also some of these guys destroyed their bodies playing on playground courts like Steve Francis so his NBA bulb burned bright for a shorter length than it would had he not played as much when he was younger.  I don’t know Rose’s situation well enough to know if this was his situation too.  Brandon Roy who you mentioned is a great comparison because he also had knees that just couldn’t take it.  Lastly, Iverson was light bodied which may have allowed him to move and cut at Derrick Rose speed without the wear and tear.  Derrick Rose is more muscled."
"What? You literally replied to a comment saying he might have got traded because of flashing gang signs and you reply calling the owner a dick. You heavily implied that the owner trading John Wall for that is a dick move.   &gt; Also, Ted? Is that you?  Lol as if some old billionaire would have a reddit account to reply to braindead commentors."
"I didn’t say it wasn’t bad what John did? Why are you directly replying to me?  Also, Ted doesn’t get a pass on all the other mistakes because of one thing he was justified in. That’s like Ernie drafting Wall and Beal. Doesn’t justify the 16 years of pure shit he put us through?  Also, Ted? Is that you?"
Lol what? John Wall hasn’t played in nearly 2 seasons man.  I wasn’t referring to Panda 🐼
"Rockets legend John Wall, that is."
"The Wizards are one of our rivals even if they haven't been great lately. They swept us. I'll always respect John Wall for that series, he bodied Lowry/DeRozan and JV on his own.     I'm glad to see that Beal and Wall are still great friends even tho all that drama that followed them in the past couple years, I was shocked to see they let Wall get healthy for 2 years then traded him before seeing the healthy Wall show up"
"His usage rate has gone up significantly over the past few seasons and he has maintained his previous efficiency or even improved on it while doing so. Not many players in the league can do that. What's slightly odd is that his 3P% has decreased, but that could probably be largely explained by shot selection and feeling like he needs to take more shots. Which probably goes into why people don't hold his team's success or lack thereof against him. Outside of a healthy John Wall the Wizards just haven't had that great of 2nd and 3rd options around Beal. Wall hasn't been healthy for more than half a season since 2017."
Wall said in an interview with Chris Miller.  “I think a lot of times we have a tendency to dislike each other on the court. … We got to be able to put that to the side. If you miss somebody on one play or don’t have something go right … as long as you come to each other and talk. If I starting arguing with somebody I’m cool. I’m just playing basketball.”  ESPN and the like caught wind of it and used the first sentence as a soundbite to turn it into “jOhN aNd BrAd HaTe EaCh OtHeR!”
John wall is one of the most dramatic non-superstar superstars I’ve ever witnessed.  The only thing you can count on him for is getting injured.
"Embiid, John Wall..."
Exactly what John Wall does now too except they don’t go in
"He didn’t gain weight lmao maybe like 5 pounds at most, that shit was padding. You don’t just lose weight as soon as you get in the game  Harden played poorly after turning his ankle and we were getting blown out by a healthy lakers back to back. That team was trash fertitta had already ran everyone out of town, blaming harden for not wanting to play with the remains of John wall and Demarcus cousins is a bit silly"
"John Wall is gonna shock some people next year, including some Rockets fans"
"What do you mean ""watch""?  There have already been plenty of amazing high school tapes released of NBA legends.  D Rose, John Wall, Vince, KG, Zion etc. have absolutely insane high school tapes.  I'm saying that even in comparison to those dudes Lebron was a different beast in high school.  Which is why he was and still is considered the best high school prospect for decades.  You're acting like all NBA players and stars were exactly the same in high school.  There is still a gradient to it, and Lebron was on another level than the vast majority of em, even though they all obviously have absurd high school highlights"
I mostly agree but I think Green will see most of his minutes at SF.  PG: John Wall  SG: Kevin Porter Jr.  SF: Jalen Green  PF: Christian Wood  C: Daniel Theis
"He and Wall will split PG duties in some way. Silas is probably going to start John Wall, but maybe they can start both (likely sending Tate to the bench) and do some weird stagger with Wall coming out early. I like the idea of putting a young guy with a vet in each unit, though, and KPJ can build confidence against weaker bench units... he still doesn't have a lot of experience running point."
[The John 'break the' Wall 'down'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsaXEgMxQz4)
"Uhhhh, John Wall and Eric Gordon I guess"
"Gilbert Arenas, John Wall, and Bradley Beal (probably)"
LaMarcus Aldridge and John Wall will totally be forgotten in 2030s cz they didn't win a title and didn't stay fit/ long enough in their teams. Also they are in small markets (NBA). If the wizards and Blazers somehow become big markets in the future maybe. DeRozan but he's not as good. I can see Griffin starting to get forgotten way faster than people think.
"Then you are way more positive than me. I wont see a bright future while Fertitta is here. Lett be honest, we have an injury prone center(Wood), 2 promising rookie (Green, Sengun) and a young guy who is a troublemaker and only shows a good half year in his first 3 years (Porter jr.). I dont see this as a bright future :D also Silas was terrible last year but tbf he had a shit roster. And dont forget the locker room cancer John Wall (at least our young guys can learn gang signs from him) and his nice contract, and EG untradeable overpaid contract too."
"John Wall, Christian Wood and 2 Nets FRP (3rd team for salary matching)  why? draft picks are overvalued and Wood is older than Simmons. Simmons is still a blue chip player and can be an important piece of a contender in 2-3 years when the Rockets prospects are ready"
Paul George  John Wall
One time I went to the W hotel and saw Draymond and John Wall hanging out in the lobby and I kept walking. I didn't bother them. So there you go.
"John Wall he sang that one song ""Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze"""
"Anthony Edwards is a decent analog for him right now in that you watch him and you think ""Man when this dude learns how to play basketball the league is in *trouble*!"" because right now he's basically just relying on being insanely athletic.  John Wall was very similar when he first came in the league where he looked like a race horse out there blowing by people but he just had not figure out the game yet, he just knew that he was way faster than everyone else."
Everybody do the John. Wall. John. Wall.
John Wall throwing the ball at Gortat's face 😅
John Wall and I say this as he’s my 2nd/3rd favorite player. Even already people just bash him for his contract and have forgotten prime Optimus Dime. Injuries really fucked over his career.
"Even some nonHOF players are gonna be remembered for a looong time. I think Kenny Beecham (KOT4Q) coined the term ""Hall Of VeryGood"" for the players that were stars in their eras but won't get to the HOF, like DeMar, John Wall, DeMarcus and the like."
"Not to mention that he got pretty big right when Social Media was starting to pop off.  Between his dougie and Gang Sign John Wall, he’ll be around for a minute. 😮‍💨"
Beal. even if he gets traded- just not that memorable of a player for casuals even though he’s very fucking good  john wall might not get remembered much outside of DC. he was pretty huge for a while though so maybe not  Nobody will remember Al Horford outside of maybe sixers fans. the same could be said about tobias harris. talk about unremarkable.
John Wall.
Mo and john wall are on my mt Rushmore of stars in a popular song
"Upon successful buyout negotiations, Shaquille O'Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Mugsy Bogues, Jeremy Lin, Derrick Rose, Andre Iguadala, Yao Ming, Carmelo Anthony, Joakim Noah, John Wall, and the entire 2013 Memphis Grizzlies roster have signed two way contracts with the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets--whichever team makes it to the finals."
The Median comes out to 6.07 separating only John Wall.   I think the average gives a clear injury zone
"Bradley Beal is 28, (not old) and is getting 34 mil this year and 35 next year.  Murray is getting 29 mil this year and 36 in 2024, about 32 per year so Beal is barely being paid more when you factor in his nba pay seniority.  I could agree with a lot of what you said before you said the nuggets wouldn’t trade Murray for Beal and 2firsts.  That is absolutely insane, Beal is an all around guard who just balled out next to Westbrook who is ultra ball dominant and played next to no jumper John wall for years.  There’s no reason to assume Beal and Jokic wouldn’t form a great connection between each other."
"2021 John Wall kinda sucks ass, it doesn’t mean much"
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"
That's John Wall defending him
"Dude he's playing with first round picks, ofc his stats are good. And yes. It's by far the worst contract in the league. AND THERE IS JOHN WALL, HAYWARD AND KEVIN LOVE. And yeah, my bad. He won't even be a fringe all star. Top 100 at best. My bad."
"But nobody wants to go work for a money grubbing owner and play with the corpse of John Wall.  Sixers have never been a FA destination because of the city, it’s because of the consistent talent.  You guys got to experience that for a few years with Harden, and then put on a season only comparable to the worst of the process years.  Maybe you guys copy the Sixers and get a great young player, but i’m going to bet that Fertitta continues to destroy the franchise and that any young player sent there will leave as soon as they have the chance to move to a talented team."
Simmons. Mpj on max is almost like the john wall contract. He is so injury prone
"I have nothing against him but fox.  Elite transition game, elite finisher and ball handler, but only a ""good"" passer and mediocre shooter.  Seems like John wall without the D and passing and slightly better scoring"
Why is John Wall assigned to defend him lol
Simmons for John wall straight up is the best I can do   :pawn stars meme:
I really think its a good thing  It just means more time for other players to prove themself  There is so much talent with young players around the league   So lets say john wall leave the rockets . It will only help the young guys become better and get more exposure early on . While now john will eat at least 26 min of other players
"yeah Brad just stuck around for the rebuild. We were just actively blowing shit up under our last GM though. We couldn't afford to keep our draft picks around like Oubre and Sato. We had basically been waiting for a bunch of contracts to expire, like Otto Porter, Mahinmi, and John Wall."
At least John Wall shoots. When he's fit. Alas.
I would definitely do John Wall and/or Eric Gordon and 3 FRPs for Ben. I might even throw in a guy like Tate.
John Wall goes for to the bench or trade him.  Ben Simmons/Eric Gordan/Kevin Porter Jr/Christian Wood/Alperen Şengün  I'm confident that team is playoff contender.
You’ll be enjoying John Wall with those prices
"klutch has lavine, lebron, ad, simmons, john wall, bledsoe, young, green, ball, clarkson etc  &amp;#x200B;  noel is really dumb, no wonder he has always been a role player and minum player"
Dummies should’ve traded Simmons and maxey last year for Harden. Now they’ll end up with John Wall
He's got nothing on our lord and savior commander john wall
John Wall was a 2019 all-star?
Gang sign John Wall
John Wall has entered the chat.
"Embiid is honestly pretty whiny and for all the flack KD gets for being too obsessed with Twitter, Embiid is not much better. We’ve all seen him pout himself I dunno why he’s fronting that hard. And also it’s funny watching the Sixers fans keeping tanking Simmons value. At this rate they’re going to get back John Wall lol"
"Ok, Imma go full hype beast and say prime John Wall is better than Kyrie at finishing inside. Google some highlights and he can use both hands with a ton of techniques like he's a point guard in the nba or something /s  I think highlights are really nice and cool. However, if we looked only at the impressiveness of highlights then Lou Williams and JR Smith would be the GOATs. If skill is measured in scoring, and field goal percent, why are we trying to adjust for Kyrie reverse euro stepping through 3 people and somehow saying the difficulty of shot determines skill?  People forget that Kyrie isn't always hot. In fact, sometimes he just murders his teams chances for winning a game by both his inability to hit and volume. This doesn't even necessarily require double teams or specialized coverages, Kyrie is not the type of player who on an average night needs somebody on him 24/7. When he's hot or catching stride yes, but he is not given the attention Curry gets. People want to give Kyrie all this credit for his handle, and thats cool and all but he plays either by himself and just tries to improvise using sheer volume scoring. When his fellow star players return, they employ a ""you're hot why the fuck are you passing shoot that shit"" strategy depending on who's hitting their looks. (Not criticizing, when you're as good as the Nets are you can just let people fuck around and then tighten down the routine and strategy as you go) Curry plays within a system built around him, and while he might have some off nights he is going to be there for you with cold streaks few and far between. This applies more broadly to their finishing ability, and thus I say again, who gives a shit how pretty the shot is if a simpler one goes in more at similar volume?"
Christian Wood? 👀Or better yet.. John Wall
"What 44 million dollar collection of things would anyone give up for John Wall?  I wouldnt even give you Kevin Love for him.  Not because I think Love is better, but because 44 million is just SOOOO fucking much."
I wanna see John Wall 100% again.  He’s so fun to watch.
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."
John wall one surprised the shit out of me
"When did John Wall become a high volume shooter/scorer? I don’t care about a wasted season in Houston. I’ve watched his entire career with the Wizards, one of his major issues was not being aggressive enough as a shooter/scorer. He’s been a league average 3 point shooter, but there was no reason he shouldn’t have made a killing at the FT line with his athletic ability. Sure that is long gone but he’s a true Point Guard. He’s not one to shoot you out of a game, he actively will get your bigs involved."
"He’s done. His ceiling is 6th man. Nobody watched our games, shit I couldn’t tolerate much of them either, but dude was absolutely fucking horribly regardless of who was around him. Singlehandedly threw games away. Usually when a guy is on a bad team you can tell he’s not the problem.   That wasn’t the case. If that was John wall we would have lost our pick to OKC"
John Wall for Ben Simmons when?
John wall and embiid seems like an equally bad fit to Simmons and embiid to me. So he might because of necessity I suppose but I don’t think they’re contending with him anyway  He’s an inefficient high volume guy there aren’t a lot of starters on contenders that fit that criteria imo
"My guesses were:  * KD * Giannis (I thought maybe against the Pistons or something) * Anthony Davis * Donovan Mitchell * John Wall * Devin Booker * Andre Iguodala  I was certain of #5 and #6 and I guessed #7 was going to be either from the Warriors or Cavaliers, because he was never going to be one of the stars and for a role player, bad FT shooter to shoot at least 20 free throws he would need a lot of games."
Only client is John Wall lol
John Wall hasn't been an above Average NBA Player since 2017 Wiggins plays every game and plays them all at an above average level.
John Wall is also an above average player. It doesn't change the fact that he's not worth his contract and he's less valuable because of it (like Wiggins).
Lmaooo John Wall plus 3 first rounders for Simmons
John wall was the ONLY one I got correct lmfao
"isn't it spoiled in the top? I'm using the Swish app and it just shows the Qs and As without any covering or anything. but to respond to the post, John Wall is a very underrated playoff performer. always had too much of a scoring role, sadly, but he's an underrated playmaker."
This was actually super interesting. I would have never guessed John Wall for 5 honestly.
"That was just a rumor. A 2021 and 2023 (allegedly) with Simmons and Thybulle is not a good return. It doesn't matter if Thybulle got all-defense second team when he played under 20 minutes per game in the playoffs, about 15 minutes less than everyone else selected for all defense. Some people say it's because he couldn't play with Simmons but then why would it be a good idea to have Simmons + Thybulle + John Wall on the same team with no picks in the trade to move Wall? And Wood really does better with spacing and would be hurt by someone like Simmons in the dunkers' spot."
You'll take John Wall and you'll like it Morey.
"It wouldn't work from a business perspective which is why it probably won't happen. This conversation about the lower cap hit supermax first started around the 2017-18 season, when a lot of guys were discussing if it was a failure after the John Wall and Russell Westbrook contracts. Small market teams in OKC and WAS had to do them in order to keep their guys, but it hurt team building was the argument. However there was a long discussion from I think Zach Lowe and some other guys, basically showing that it would be impossible for the small market teams to sign someone on a supermax that didn't count against the cap to make money. It's been a couple of years so I might not have all the details correct, but essentially their argument was showing the Grizzlies compared to the Lakers. They had access (by being insiders I guess) to pre-profit sharing revenues of each team and the Grizzlies who were a playoff team that years were somehow -12m before profit sharing whereas the Lakers who were awful that year were up 80m. The no cap hit supermax would essentially mean Memphis would be -20 to -30 million down instead of only -12 if they had a supermax player. No amount of profit sharing would make that up to make them profitable whereas the Lakers would have even more power to essentially sign away guys because they don't care about paying them at all."
"That does open up the problem of what happens in a John Wall type situation.  If the supermax player gets injured and falls off as a result, the team would get royally fucked.  We'd need a way to deal with what happens when a supermax player no longer produces at a supermax level that doesn't unduly penalize the player or the team.  That could get pretty complicated."
"We cant know the reasons why superstar stay here or go there for sure, but money Is a factor. We cant know what John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, James Harden or Giannis was gonna do if there wasnt the supermax."
John Wall is great.
That's true but John Wall is def a floor general
John Wall has a way worse jumper than Russ if we include the mid rangers
DPOY is Duncan def  Scoring is probably Elgin Baylor or Dame   Assist is maybe Luka? John Wall idk
"Not the darkest era, but the post john wall ""everybody eats"" era (2017-present) has sucked more than not."
Atl- Trae  Boston- Rondo  BKN- Kyrie  Charlotte - Kemba   Chicago - D Rose  Cleveland - LeBron  Dallas - Dirk  Denver - Jokic  Detroit - nobody  GSW - Steph  Houston- Harden  Indiana - Paul George  LAC - CP3  LAL - Kobe  Memphis - Ja Morant  Miami - LeBron  Milwaukee - Giannis  Minnesota - Kevin Love  Pelicans - AD  Knicks - Carmelo Anthony   OKC - Westbrook  Orlando - Dwight   Philly - Simmons  Phoenix - Steve Nash  Portland - Dame  Sacramento - Fox  San Antonio - Kawhi  Toronto - DeRozan  Utah - Donovan Mitchell  Wizards - John Wall
&gt;Philly ships out Simmons to Houston for a John Wall package  The fit makes no sense at all
from most likely to least:  1. Philly ships out Simmons to Houston for a John Wall package   2. Towns becomes disgruntled — Warriors swoop in with a trade package   3. Memphis lands Brandon Ingram
DRose and John Wall were like that too.
2010-2013 Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets era… I remember vividly watching Cartier Martin drop 25 on us as we lost to a John Wall-less Wizards by over 30+ points during the 7-59 season. I legitimately thought at the time that the National Champion Kentucky team led by AD could beat us…
John Wall
"Jokic is on a competitive team though. Obvs they're not favourites, but they're ranked 8th (tied) in terms of odds to win, and I think that's a lowball. With MVP caliber Jokic, an improving MPJ and if we see playoff Murray again they certainly will make a strong push for the conference finals and upsets happen. (for context they have significantly better odds than the Suns did this year).   I'm not saying he's on a team that's likely to win but it's also not a team we're just gonna forget about because they dont play meaningful basketball (ie it's not the same level as John Wall at the meanginless rockets)"
"I'll say John Wall was out for almost two years though. A serious amount of time to rest. Two years is honestly really needed, but you miss one year, and as an athlete, that's a serious fucking chance to miss"
"Every fan base. I always see guys making trades and posting like ""this is fair for everyone I think"" when it's like a 2nd round pick and Andrew Wiggins or John Wall for LeBron"
"Depends on how he recovers from that ACL injury.  He could probably average 20 PPG, 7+ APG, 6 RPG and maybe have a John Wall like season."
"One of my buddies from high school was a 5’9” white dude who was primarily a baseball player, and he dropped 24 points on John Wall. So I’m gonna say my buddy."
John Wall seems fine enough
"Rose appeared to be able to force his way to the basket at will, and I believe Lillard is unable to do so.  He'd string together a series of herky-jerky manoeuvres that would render the defence helpless.  He was one of the explosive athletic combo-guards of the 2010s, alongside John Wall, Kyrie Irving, and the manner he moved on the court was so modernized.  He truly had a good feel for the game. I don’t know what it was about him specifically but he just played the game his way."
"Why is Beal better than Thompson, what has Beal done? Barely made the playoffs in the East? Carried by John Wall to the 2nd round?"
"Kawhi had one bad game in the nuggets series and for the rest of the time carried lou Williams, montrezl harrell, doc rivers, and Paul George yet people still blame the loss on kawhi.  Harden is good in the playoffs, John wall was too  I have some that are the opposite, dame isn’t all that great in the playoffs, and people are still overrating Giannis because of this playoff run."
"John Wall -- never made a Conference Finals, but, was balled out during the playoffs. Since Washington wasn't a team that got consistent contributions from the second unit, they badly needed a third dynamic player next to Wall and Beal. The best they could do was add Paul Pierce who was at the tail end of his career"
"Otto Porter Jr. is rejuvenated as much as Batum was for the Clippers, enough to be a member of a bargain bin Death Lineup.   John Wall will be an incredible tank commander and greatly benefit the development of the Rockets young guys. His inevitable injury will let the front office let out a sigh of relief as they were winning just a couple more games than they really were comfortable with."
"Harvard is just a generic example, but there's a lot of evidence that getting into a decent school in general is much more likely if you come from even a middle class family. You don't have to have your parents buy your way in, but having parents that can afford to have you take SAT prep courses will make your scores go way up, just like being able to afford private schools will help with your education. Honestly it's naive to feel like Rich Paul is the only guy who got to his position through something other than exclusively hard work. You're kidding yourself if you think most agents started from the same place that he did.   You're also kidding yourself if you think he's the only guy LeBron ever encountered. LeBron chose him to represent him for more than just random happenstance. He must have done something to impress him, probably many things. Additionally, he wouldn't have done as well with the opportunity LeBron gave him if he wasn't actually good at his job. Nerlens Noel might not think so, but I'll bet someone like John Wall does."
"He's in the John Wall category, he's gonna get maxed"
maybe this is just personal opinion but i feel like out of all the superstar pointguards of the 2010s John Wall kinda flies under the radar
Can somebody please stop grouping John Wall with those guys? He was a bonafide allstar who got injured when he signed the contract.
Those are all LeBrons boys though guys I’m sure have had a personal relationship with Rich through LeBron for a long while and John Wall signed a 170m extension after averaging 23/3/11 at age 26 which isn’t a crazy savvy agent move.
"Full quote from that guy —  “Tristan - got paid Bledsoe - got paid Jr - got paid Draymond - 100M JOHN WALL - robbed the league.  This is so one sided.  If rich paul is doing it wrong, show me who’s doing it right”  I think he still has a good point.  Rich Paul has gotten some of his guys better than market value.  Significantly better, especially for role players.  Nerlens may have gotten screwed but it’s not accurate to say he only caters to superstars"
"Yup, it comes from a weird mentality because people think athletes are just playing a game, but not understanding that the business side of the game literally wouldn't exist if not for the players.  Superstars are underpaid in a system with max contracts. Steph is, at worst, fairly compensated, but he's probably underpaid when you look at the value he brings to the franchise. LeBron has been underpaid his entire career compared to the money he brings in for any of his teams. The only max players who are actually overpaid are guys like Tobias Harris (who due to salary cap limitations had leverage when he signed his deal) or John Wall (who will never be healthy enough to play at the level that earned him his deal, but that's not really his fault)."
We talking about Mitchell or John Wall?
This is just my skewed view on what I’d expect from each pick by using a player and their accolades/skill  1 - John Wall   2-5/6 - Al Horford/Mike Conley level  6-10 -Wiggins  11-14 - Terry Rozier before he left Boston  Past Lottery you should be happy with a starter/25mpg level guy imo
"Not really, just give John Wall a normal amount of playing time and he’ll figure out how to get hurt."
"Good find! Another issue that I was finding with using the way back machine is that the pics aren’t in good quality anymore. Like the current John Wall ESPN pic is good quality, transparent background, etc. Trying to download the images via wayback ends up with blurry images.   Thank you for your help, I appreciate it."
On the 2nd worst efficiency in the league for a guy taking at least 15 FGA/G. John Wall was the only one who was worse.
If you're looking at ESPN. I think what happened is in 2016 they went from being espn.go.com to espn.com  For example here's a rookie page for John Wall  https://web.archive.org/web/20100227121425/http://insider.espn.go.com/nbadraft/draft/tracker/player?playerId=19378&amp;draftyear=2010&amp;action=login&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fnbadraft%2fdraft%2ftracker%2fplayer%3fplayerId%3d19378%26draftyear%3d2010
John Wall had his career ruined by injuries. We should have seen 3-4 maybe even 5 seasons on the level that he had in 2017 but it just wasn’t meant to be
I don’t think you understand that John Wall is a role player
"John Wall was the median number 1 pick, interesting. Can you tell us who the medians for the other picks are?"
Don't nba teams have to pay a minimum amount of money they make as salary? John wall is going to live it up in Houston
fair point. i dont really know much about john wall in houston
"&gt;But looking at the data it became obvious that those numbers were heavily skewed by a few outliers (\*cough\* LeBron and Kareem \*cough\*).  I think that's kind of the point, though. The idea is that with the #1 pick that you have a disproportionate chance of landing a generational player.   Teams are really good at convincing themselves that their top pick is going to be one of those guys (e.g., I remember the discussion around John Wall), but I wonder, since 2000, how many of those generational, franchise-transforming players have there been?  LeBron, Wade, KD, Steph, Harden, Giannis, right? Am I missing someone?   Literally only one of those guys was drafted #1.   Only three of them won a title on the team that drafted them without leaving first - and none of those guys went #1, either."
"Agreed.   If he agrees to a bench role, that would great for Houston  But John Wall still thinks he’s that guy. I dont think he’d take kindly to that"
"I think they will start KPJ, Jalen Green and John Wall until they eventually buy him out"
John Wall is not gonna take kindly to that. He’s also a client of Klutch Sports  You don’t disrespect guys like that. It’s not a good look
John Wall literally became the next Gilbert Arenas
"The solution may be he goes home.  You do not sacrifice any part of your development to make John Wall happy. If he wants to play, take a huge paycut."
"Anyone want a slightly used, slightly overpaid John Wall?"
Yeah well the Rockets had the best draft this year so that softens the blow.  John Wall can be your scapegoat.
I think there was a post a while ago that went through all the number 1 pick's careers and the conclusion was your absolute average number 1 pick is John Wall.
"Ouch, being reminded we pay 40millions a year to John Wall destroys my mood"
Just ask John Wall. That man couldn't have signed that extension at a better time.
Guaranteed money.  Lock yourself in right now and not take any chances.  John Wall is testament to that.
You'll sign John Wall in two years as your big FA acquisition
Replace Bol Bol with John Wall and you’ve got both.   Wall-Paul-Ball-Ball-Ball basketball.
"I can easily admit Jordan was better than Kobe. That was never the discussion of my earlier posts, nor did I allude to it.  They were both 6’6 but their athleticism are miles alert. Jordan’s hands were 9.75 inch, same size as Kawhi and just slightly smaller than Giannis. Kobe’s were nearly a full inch shorter at 9 flat. Jordan had 6’11-6’11.5 wingspan to Kobe’s under 6’11. Jordan’s vertical was 48 to Kobe’s 38. Jordan’s speed was reportedly in line with top point guards in 3/4 court spring like John Wall, while Kobe was above avg for SG.  Mike was better than Kobe as a player with comparable skills, much stronger body, more mature mind and overall combining into higher efficiency. The incredible thing about Kobe is despite the inferiority of physical gifts, that he even got close to the GOAT. At least for me.  Lastly Kobe definitely had better ball-handling/crossovers, skills running the pick and roll, and volume 3pt shooting than Mike. These 3 isolated areas don’t matter in who’s the better overall player, but your point on MJ better 1 level above Kobe in everything is definitely false."
I don't think a single Rockets fan would call John Wall our #2 lol
"Knicks: ""Buddy Hield"" , ""John Wall""  Fuck you"
John wall will make close to 50 million dollars in 22/23 with his player option.
"I mean you could get injured in practice too, just play all the summer league games. Didn't klay and john wall reinjure their achilles at home/in a workout."
John Wall then Blake Griffin.   Griffin's contract is better put into perspective when you think about the fact that he's being paid nearly $40M for a level of play worthy of a vet min deal.   Thank jebus it's ending this year.
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
John Wall thinks he has the best contract in the league.
John wall at least gets along with the people in the locker room
"i watched the entire thing at 6x speed. it's not THAT bad of a list  how is andre drummond #165? how is he above al horford, bradley beal, jrue holiday, john wall, KAT, brad daugherty? kevin love over yao ming? billups over reggie miller? moncrief over miller?"
John wall is coming up a lot. Is there any contender next season that could trade for him?
"Love is a net negative and is worse overall than John Wall, but John Wall is a larger net negative than Love because John Wall is the primary ball-handler when he's on the court and it leads to many issues."
Pope John [Paul Wall](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ReadyBabyishArabianoryx-size_restricted.gif)?
As a Rocket fan - PLEASE one of you contenders take John Wall!! He’s a pretty nice guy for a PIRU BLOOD and he passes the ball sometimes. Pretty please?
2021 John Wall is a poor mans 2017 John Wall
"John Wall. Flashy, interesting player for the fans and offensively gifted but subpar on defense. Still a good passer, collaborator and playmaker to help develop young players, and their being injury prone allows the young guys to get more time and costs the team several wins."
"Love is a net negative and is worse overall than John Wall, but I’d rather have $20 million extra to spend on an actually productive player"
Yeah could be true. I think a post injury Klay is still probably more valuable than post injury John wall. John wall was 95% speed and athleticism where as Klay can post up in the corner and drill 3s.  I guess we shall see when the season starts
"Starters:   Ben Simmons   Kyrie Irving   Brandon Ingram   Zion Williamson   Anthony Davis     Bench:   Ja Morant   Victor Oladipo   Karl Anthony-Towns     I'd consider swapping KAT and Zion in my starting lineup, let Ben start so Morant can avoid injury and be the spark off the bench. Dipo over John Wall for a bit of length and defense."
John wall is still a better basketball player than Kevin Love. it’s Love.
John Wall stands to make around $20 million more than Kevin Love next season. It’s Wall.
John Wall unless he has a resurgence
John wall easy
John Wall
"John wall right now, but in a couple years it's gonna be jimmy butler"
It’s John Wall we’ve been over this. Love close 2nd. If we aren’t taking injury stricken guys it is probably Tobias Harris/Ben Simmons.
his name starts with John and ends with Wall
john wall
"John Wall, KPJ, Green, Wood, Hakeem. Good luck stopping anything in the paint lol"
Prime John Wall &gt; Kyrie
"&gt;	Stars of today  &gt;	Al Horford, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul Millsap  Think you scuffed that one buddy"
"It fully depends on Wall and Irving accepting roles as the clear facilitator(Wall) and the scorer(Irving). It would kind of be what we see between Harden and Kyrie. Obviously, Harden is a very different player from Wall, but, I think if there’s a clear understanding of the defined roles, I see it working really well.  I think Westbrook would work well too. They don’t need an elite big. The Warriors are so good at taking bigs out of games, even the best ones in the game. You need dudes who can take the guards off the dribble, and John Wall would definitely be a guy who could do that in 2017."
"John Wall.  You get defense, a passer who can score, and a guy who can push the pace. Plus, you get him pre-injury. He was playing so well before his most recent string of injuries."
John Wall has you on that one.
John Wall
"You should write articles for TMZ with your whole journalistic ass take on my response. We all know what I meant, John Wall ain't no Russ or Giannis. Yes all stars have a high usage rate but there's certain aspects that make a star a superstar. Y'know some little things called winning, playing defense, being a good leader, making sacrifices, efficiency, etc etc etc  I also never once said a streaky shooter can't be a superstar. I was simply labelling the things wrong with John Walls game that prevent him from reaching superstar status. As a point guard you can't be a terrible shooter from three if you wanna be a superstar, we have more than enough evidence of that over the last decade."
Neh but John wall ain't Westbrook
Replace John Wall with Lowry in 2019 and the Raptors don’t make it out of the second round
"John Wall 2015-16 playoff stats:  0.0 PTS (0/0/0) 0.0 AST 0.0 STL 0.0 BLK (0 games)  Lowry 2015-16 playoff stats:  19.1 PTS (40/31/75) 6 AST 1.3 STL 0.2 BLK (20 games, lost in 6 to prime Lebron who went on to beat the 73-9 Warriors being down 1-3)"
Tbh the clippers are desperately missing that veteran star power presence that John wall gives us. It just makes sense
"I'm fine Rondo is gone but damn Pat Bev. Am I gonna have to hate him now? Just glad we didn't end up with John Wall.  Zubac, one of the youngest players on the team is the most tenured Clipper now."
Damn they could’ve easily got John Wall for that package lol
That’s future Brooklyn net 6 man John wall to you sir.
John Wall nowhere near Westbrook
I agree John wall would provide the clippers their third star they need to compete with the Lakers.
John Wall never played with Kawhi
Confirmed u/Lanesra99 is John Wall
John wall
"John Wall is a great fit for the Clippers. He defends well, he’s a fantastic playmaker when he has actual options, and there are worse shooters in the league.  Please trade for John Wall."
John wall is probably the tank commander for the rockets for the next several years
Kawhi for John Wall duh
I still think prime John Wall &gt; prime Kyrie Irving.
John wall is not gonna be forgotten by DC at least lol
Wtf are you talking about? Are you comparing two MVPs to John Wall? Maybe instead of name calling you should learn the game a little 💀  Russ and Giannis were/are superstars either right now (Giannis) or in the past ( Westbrook). You literally proved my point.
Maybe him and John Wall are somehow kinetically linked from the Kentucky days?
"Y'all throw around the word superstar like a hooker. John Wall was in no way shape or form a superstar. The dude was brick city outside of like 10 feet, a streaky shooter at best. His insane usage rate inflated his stats. Superstars are top 5 players in the league like the LeBrons, KDs and Currys of the world. John Wall was in the second tier after superstars AT BEST."
Well it’s better than overselling for John Wall but Bledsoe isn’t a ideal player either. I can see them working with teams all the way to the deadline to see what opens up
Kyle Lowry 1 championship  John Wall 0 championships
John Wall is way more popular than Beal by far
Prime John Wall over Kyrie
"Wall will always have the best hoopmixtape of all time, his own song, and the best dougie of all time. No way John Wall will ever be forgotten, he’s one of the most polarizing players of the 2010’s."
"Lillard, john wall, rudy gobert, Ingram, and julius randle."
John Wall 2016-17 playoff stats:  27.2 PTS (45/34/84) 10.3 AST 1.7 STL 1.2 BLK (13 games)  Kyle Lowry 2016-17 playoff stats  15.8 PTS (46/34/81) 5.9 AST 1.5 STL 0.5 BLK (8 games)
"On a 30.5% usage rate, whereas Lowry had a 24.9% usage rate. So John Wall averaged 1 more point and 4 more assists on a higher usage rate while still being less efficient, a worse defender and having a 31% three point shot."
That the year John wall averaged like 23PPG and 11 Assists on 45% FG
John Wall is a poor mans Russell Westbrook
John Wall will be remembered for the dougie
John Wall was a superstar. 2nd best player in the East in 2016 and 2017
"John Wall,Beal,Melo,Cousins,Draymond,DeRozan,Lowry,Butler.  Just look at Paul Pierce,he was a true baller and he is basically a meme now and new fans think he was some average player.Most of current players will end up in “meh” category"
If Mike Conley makes it the hall of fame should be shut down. Same with Kemba Walker and John Wall.
"At his current trajectory, no way. Reggie put the Pacers on the map, and was the face of some very successful teams for nearly two decades. He was a staple in the playoffs, and had post season matchups against some of the most famous teams in league history (MJ’s Bulls, 90s Knicks, Shaq-Kobe Lakers). And maybe most of importantly, his playing style was unique for the time: never before had there been a marksman superstar like Reggie.   Now let’s compare that to Beal. He only took the mantle from John Wall as the face of the Wizards maybe 3 or 4 seasons, and has made the playoffs in 0 of those. Even when he was more Walls sidekick their Wizard teams never made it past the second round. And although he’s elite, nothing Beal does is special for this era."
"untucked kyrie, gang sign john wall, lebron seeing 3 rims"
I think Ja Morant will have a John Wall type of career
Seems like we already forgot about John Wall so
"Best tank commander is someone who can be on court and be shit on both side of the floor to make sure you lose.  Eg: Drummond, current john wall etc."
"My Blue Jackets would beg to differ. Also, there is a huge difference in the success of the franchise from early in Ovi’s career and what he has been surrounded with, to a guy you replaced your old franchise player, John Wall with to make a team that got stamped out in the first round of the playoffs.  There are also plenty of stars in pro basketball that stay with their teams for a long time."
They traded John Wall who wanted to stay after essentially wasting his career. Fuck Ted Leonsis.
To be fair - John Wall will be Bulter's age at the end of his current contract.
"Ah, I gotcha.  So Bobby Marks saw the Hornets receive a 1st for S&amp;Ting their *restricted* free agent Graham, and he's decided that's now just the market value of helping complete any S&amp;T (I think he's wrong).  The Wizards sent a heavily protected 1st to the Rockets in the John Wall trade (now OKC owns the pick) which locked all our picks from 2022-2027 due to the protections and the Stepien Rule.  So the end result is if for some reason the Wizards need to send a 1st to the Nets (we shouldn't), we need to unprotect that 1st so that we can legally trade our other picks."
"All jokes and politics aside, I liked him in 18-19.  He had great chemistry with John Wall and off-ball cuts."
"Take the western conference last year. How many starting PGs would you take ahead of Schroeder? Conley, Paul, Murray, Reggie Jackson, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, curry, Ball, Fox, dejounte Murray, Russell, John wall, and Maledon.  I see maybe 2 I’d take after him. That’s pretty bad lol. He’s not v good. He’s a sixth man."
"Develop the young core of Green/Kpj/Sengun/Garuba/Kenyon Martin jr  while keeping Wood and Tate happy enough.   If we can somehow move the worst contract in the history of the League, aka John Wall on +40M, that would be a home run but I don't think that's happening.  My Ideal season is competing for the play in spot, losing it and getting a high draft pick."
"Highest offensive loads of Championship teams have been forwards. The list: Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Curry, LeBron, Dirk, Kobe, Paul Pierce, DWade, ShaKobe, Duncan.   The 2014 Spurs kinda split 50/50 on Guards (Manu/Parker) and forwards (Duncan/Kawhi).  But regardless Curry and Kyrie are the only guys you can cite that take a lot of shots and don’t carry a big load on defense. 2012 Westbrook had 3.1 DWS and his highest was 5 (almost Double Dame’s highest 2.7)…  Curry also had multiple seasons of 4 DWS or better and he *was* criticized as someone that you could exploit. Kyrie the same.   I think the overall point isn’t even that small guards should be able to play a high level of defense and offense. Chris Paul, John Wall, Stockton, Payton are the exceptions.   The point is, rarely does it come back to Dame to be better. CJ does get criticized, at least occasionally but still not enough that it’s the obvious move to ship him out.  Just dive into it man. Dame is very bad on defense and he gets a pass for it. CJ is also bad on defense and he gets a pass. The big thing with Portland has been that they seem like contenders but I think fundamentally they’re not."
if John Wall and Beal at their peak can't get people to come to Washington how TF does dinwiddie think he's gonna do something.
Beal went from peak John Wall to injured John Wall to older Westbrook to Dinwiddie
"Wall, John"
John Wall
So so many teams. Look at John Wall
Thats John wall numbers
Come get John Wall  We’ll even give you some picks (2nds)
"Its always possible to move a contract for an even worse contract, that doesn't take skill. I'd say Kemba's contract is the second worse in the whole league, only to John Wall, so I was joking by saying maybe you can pull off one more swap but obviously that won't happen.  I fully understand what is going on there, Presti is under no obligation to try and win any games, and can fully focus on accumulating as many future draft assets as possible as he pushes the buck down the line. I hate to break it to you, but that doesn't take skill, that takes job security lol tanking and being buyers of bad contracts where players go to die is not something that requires skill.   The Russ and CP3 examples were completely different circumstances...Horford as I already explained was a net negative move, and if you somehow manage to convince someone to take Kemba off your hands it will either be by taking on more even worse contracts or you will have to attach your precious draft picks back as compensation.   You guys really think Presti has the ability to polish up a turd and sell it to people as diamonds lol"
They're not ending as bad for most that signed them. Only John Wall seems like the outlier.
Id take both of them in their prime before John wall no Brainer
"All different circumstances...honestly I'd take Horford off this list, you guys act like you traded Horford for assets...you traded him for a way bigger liability, and were paid off with a draft pick to make up the difference. Still probably worth it to you guys since you aren't trying to play competitive basketball any time soon and can waste your salary cap on atrocious contracts until they expire...but still don't act like you traded Horford straight up for assets in return lol  Maybe you guys can trade Kemba if you take on even worst contracts back..John Wall is the only one worse."
One lightly used John Wall
"John wall is worth more than 2011 Lebron, Wade, and Bosh."
"EG wasted Wall’s prime no question as Leonsis only cares about the bottom line and launching his own sportsbook (as he lobbies for the age restriction to be lifted on sports betting in DC).  When the opportunity presented itself Wall sacrificed his body routinely AND THEN continued to play through those injuries into the postseason. Not just for the team, but for the city. Wall embraced DC at a time when violence and disparity blanketed the people. Wall saw himself, his late father, as those people and truly loved us. I dare anyone to find a more genuine person than John Wall. I am honored to have watched a skinny kid from Raleigh grow into the man who stood as a symbol of hope in our nation’s capital. Loyalty is never forgotten, John Wall is forever."
"Lmao I think I remember that, when Bron and D Wade were recruiting John Wall to South Beach"
John wall🥵
&gt; have been looking for one since forever.  Uh... John Wall? Russel Westbrook?
Worse than the John Wall contract?

John Wall ~~would be~~ is awful ~~for the Pelicans~~
Kemba is absolutely better than John Wall and Rockets fans need to stop acting like them hyping him online is going to change any front office's opinion on him
That’s what I’d say if I was a John wall salesman
John Wall would be awful for the Pelicans
Can you imagine you have a 30-yo john wall type player  Give them the 7 year supermax or they walk  If they're still playing well 2-3 years into their 7 year deal they request a trade to the lakers  If they have a major injury that's 5+ years of your franchise down the drain
"Nah, just think how bad some of the contracts are how.... can you imagine if John Wall still had 4 years of max money left on his deal?"
"Is John Wall really gonna wanna be a tank commander tho, or is he going to ask to be bought out?"
John Wall*
"Tobias Harris for Everyone not named John Wall or Eric Gordon, 4 First Round picks and 4 pick swaps  —- Daryl Morey"
Interesting. Were they trying to get John wall. Nothing else on that roster makes much sense
The Rockets. They are gonna unleash the kids with John Wall as tank commander.
if it wasn't for John Wall then it'd actually be hard to match contracts.
where does it say john wall
Lmaooooo the offer was Harris for John Wall and the Rockets said no 😂😂😂
"John wall, ty lawson, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Eric bledsoe."
An nba doctor would have to examine kawhi and completely rule him out for this season. For example an nba doctor did not rule out john wall for the 19-20 season so they could not get the exception. It’s kind of a toss up if they could or couldn’t
Baba = Japanese John Wall
I’d trade John Wall for him in a heartbeat just for the cap space
Do the John wall - Troop 41
Do The John Wall
"Doesn’t John wall hurt the tank tho, he’s going to win you games?  Honestly I could be wrong at this point, I haven’t seen much rockets John wall but I can’t imagine him being a net negative player ignoring his contract"
"It's like sophomore year John Wall. All that rookie year/mixtape stuff was behind him, but he was playing on an dogshit wizards team. Wall wasn't relevant after his rookie year (2010) until he made the playoffs in 2014."
But but he averages 1 assist a game for his whole career! Think about his passing upside.   Also a 3 and D guy that shoots 32.6% from 3 for his career. John wall shoots 32.3% for his career for comparison on similar attempts per game (3.1 to 3.8). This year: JW 31.7% on 6.2 attempts/game. KO 31.6% on 5.2 attempts/game.   Would you pick up John wall for floor spacing? Then you shouldn’t for KO either really.
John Wall isn’t a fringe all star.  I’d argue he isn’t even a starting caliber point guard anymore.  He looks washed.
40 games is enough for him to put on a tanking masterpiece.  You underestimate John Wall
Regardless of his value around the league he's still easily movable. It's not like he's on a John Wall contract.

Damn who's gonna lead the tank now.  No Oladipo and no Bradley. All that's left is John Wall who'll play like 40 games.
"It is fair to the players. Maybe the NBA should work restrictions around things other than salary. Nobody would be saying it was unfair if the Lakers had John Wall right now instead of Westbrook. We shouldn't have a situation where owners get to pay players less. If anything, they are already paid too little relative to their worth. So long as you think through the lens of a salary cap, you will only end up with salary cap restrictions."
Fully healthy rockets. If John Wall was healthy thats a finals team ez. Don't forget the Cavs. KLove healthy? No way the Bucks win
At least John wall plays
Kevin Love has to be the worst contract in the league right? John Wall seems pretty close lately too
"yea not a bad return for the Wizards. By trading away John Wall and Westbrook's contracts in two consecutive off-seasons, the Wizards have acquired 2 first-round picks, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell.   That seems like a solid enough return for what many would consider seemingly untradeable contracts."
John Wall calling back Javale McGee who run to d' other side of d' court to play defense. Wizards has d' ball after d' offensive rebound.
John wall
The ol 'John Wall'
"John Wall all day. Both have poor shot selection at times, but Wall can set up half court offense and is a better defender. I watched every Wizards and Rockets game this season."
“The Lakers have sign and traded the rest of the roster for John Wall.”
John Wall was pretty bad this year   Like yes he averaged 20 ppg but it was a very ugly 20 ppg on like 50% TS
"Fuck me for fantasizing, sorry man! I'll fix it  John Wall is washed up and worthless. He has no trade value and is overpaid. He has no redeemable aspects   Better?"
I see where you coming from. But D Rose averaged 25 and 5 on ridiculous shooting splits. John Wall would shoot you out the game
"He was balling, then injuries happened everywhere, then became tank commander   I didn't panic buy a knockoff John Wall Rockets jersey for nothing (at least at first)"
"Westbrick sadly, John Wall is even worse"
John wall and Eric Gordon 👀
"TBH they're still better off now than before. No more John Wall or Westbrook contracts. Harrell is expiring and KCP is not fully guaranteed. If Beal walks, they're less hamstrung than you think."
also john wall was like one of the only guys we could even trade westbrook for
Like trading Chris Paul and picks for Westbrook only to then trade him for John Wall ? Those kinds of smart moves ?
Isn’t that what took out John wall as well?? Shower rules need to be readdressed clearly
I wonder if the Rockets and Clips could figure out a deal for John Wall that works for both parties.
John Wall type tings
This just reminds me of John Wall having fragments in his Achilles and then slipping in his own house to tear it.
Did you watch the games? There were at least 10 games where we lost because john Wall started chain Iso bricking midrange shots for the last 7 minutes of the game.  The most egregious one was against the Timberwolves
"Guys, stop, as a casual Wizards fan John Wall had more of an impact on the D. C. strip club scene than Wizards basketball"
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
"Nice try , pelinka.  I'll give you a first round and John wall max."
"Hating Harden seems stupid at this point, he made the Rockets a contender for most of the 2010s and carried them with some trash rosters to the playoffs. Then this year they expected former league MVP James Harden to carry John Wall and Demarcus Cousins corpses and second option Christian Wood (who got injured btw) to a title? That off season was a joke, trading away Ariza for a pick and WB for Wall and a pick scream “oh we want to rebuild btw” and Harden who is still an MVP caliber player was expected to carry that squad to his final chances at a chip? The first game Harden returns he drops what 44-17 and the Rockets STILL lose to Portland, yeah, fat chance"
"When John Wall was on wizards podcast during that season he said that, obviously relative to their level of competition/talent, this was the best team he’d ever seen. In any level of basketball"
"They primarily wanted to get off his deal. I mean they traded for Westbrook with John Wall and a heavily protected pick. Kuzma, KCP and Harrell are all 3 decent assets and give them a lot more flexibility."
Yeah about that John Wall guy that is so important to y'all... Do you want him back ?
"Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. John Matassa, who works in the Valley Traffic Division, told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne that Clarke was a solo occupant in a vehicle that ran a red light going ""at a very high rate of speed"" in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles at approximately 2:10 p.m. PT.   ""The incident was captured on surveillance video. He collided with another vehicle that was preparing to make a left-hand turn. He struck the vehicle, hit a street light pole and ultimately hit a block wall,"" Matassa said. ""He was transported to Northridge Hospital and was later pronounced deceased as a result of the collision.""        Damn, man."
"The Rockets turned  Pat Beverley, Harrel, Sam Dekker, and Lou Williams into John Wall,  and the Wizards turned John Wall into Kuzma, Harrel, KCP, and Aaron Holiday."
The fact that they got Westbrook coming off of a 2nd Team All-NBA season for John Wall coming off an Achilles tear was actually pretty crazy.
"“Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. John Matassa, who works in the Valley Traffic Division, told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne that Clarke was a solo occupant in a vehicle that ran a red light going ‘at a very high rate of speed’ in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles at approximately 2:10 p.m. PT.  ‘The incident was captured on surveillance video. He collided with another vehicle that was preparing to make a left-hand turn. He struck the vehicle, hit a street light pole and ultimately hit a block wall,’ Matassa said. ‘He was transported to Northridge Hospital and was later pronounced deceased as a result of the collision.’  Matassa said the driver of the other vehicle, who was in a truck, did not claim any injuries. Clarke was driving a 2021 Hyundai Genesis, and he was not wearing his seat belt properly, according to Matassa.”  https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/31313103/former-kentucky-wildcats-guard-terrence-clarke-19-dies-following-car-accident"
"youre looking at it wrong. We turned Wall (the corpse of John Wall on a supermax) and a 1st into KCP, Kuz, Trez, Kispert, Todd, Holiday and 25m in cap space. We fleeced all these mfers, Russ was here for less than a year and we got to enjoy going to the playoffs too"
Again we just saying stupid things? John wall had a much better supporting cast than westbrook and they didn’t have to deal with covid as a team. Keep reaching lol
"Again, didn't John Wall lead the Wizards to the playoffs year after year a few years ago with a shitty bench and a less seasoned Bradley Beal?  Westbrook didn't do shit."
"If the rockets wanna pull a blake and pay him to ring chase he'd be down for that probably, if people think a washed John Wall is giving up millions of dollars they're crazier than a fish with titties."
I'm impressed at how wizards got rid of that John wall contract and somehow got assets back
Yep and John Wall is still here so NO ONE is getting developed on his watch
Rockets: John Wall with a bunch of 20 year olds
He gets lumped in with 2nd tier point guards sometimes... its frustrating when people think John Wall is better than Dame.. and I love John Wall. The more I dig up on dame the better player he seems to be all around. He's a decent defender and it's never for lack of trying. Thats the biggest thing that stands out to me
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
85-90% John Wall is still a solid player he'll just never be worth the gobs of money he's getting paid. Houston can't really rebuild until he's off that contract.

"yeah he has less people to pass to, really. if more guys were knocking down shots off his passes, he'd be passing even more than he already does. I don't think you can tell me John Wall can't run a teams offense and play solid defense and do some damage in transition. not if he's the second or optimally third best player on the team. if you swapped him and Conley, I'm not saying he'd be as good from a BBIQ standpoint but I think he'd be viewed as much better than he looks with this rockets team."
"So, you expect Harden to carry the team with John Wall who is two years out of the league with a blown Achilles. Also, Demarcus Cousins who was also out of the league for two years with a torn ACL. How is he supposed to contend in the west with that roster???"
That's a huge overpay for john wall. Rwill and pritchard are some of the only competent bench pieces we have rn. And Rwill has legit starting center potential dudes an absolute freak athlete.
John Wall is literally a borderline all-star.
Boston. John Wall contract is awful too and giving up their two best bench player makes them worse
"John Wall to BOS for Robert Williams, Kemba, Pritchard + a pick. Who says no?"
 Damn...that is super cool. Did you get close to Clarkson? Reminds me of the time I got to hang out with John Wall and the wizards.
Right now I'd say John Wall. He provides good leadership for all of these young guys. Rockets will look good in 5 years
I doubt it. Did you see [John Wall](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/john-wall-6882/)'s contract?
Spurs wouldn't want John wall for LMA?

28 is a good cut off age (maybe even younger) because the fans of these young guys have been following them on like ig and shit forever. like i was watching brandon knight and john wall on ballislife but i wasn't checking their myspace or whatever was popular at the time.
"I always loved John Wall, this was not what I expected  Seriously though, the whole team is crashing and burning badly, dipo doesnt want to stay, there isnt much left of John Wall, our picks are in a tough spot, and we don't have a ton of young assets excluding Wood, who looked really good but can't catch a break, just gotta see what happens"
"They are 5 games away from the 12 seed. They've lost 16 straight games. They were 3-6 even when Harden was there. They're laughably far from a top team, believe us, we weren't expecting them to be a top seed. What part of 35 year old PJ Tucker, rusty John Wall, discontent Victor Oladipo, and Christian Wood is better than literally any of the teams in front of them besides... Thunder maybe? Kings maybe? The 11 seed in the west has 2 young all stars, when do you project this Rockets team to surpass them? Until then, best they could be is 12, and the other 3 teams around them all have better young stars."
Did everyone forget about John Wall he got a 4yr/$171 million and played 73 total games in the whole four years!
John Wall?
Death   Tax  Kevin Love and John Wall appearing in injury report
"No you just said you were.  The trouble is you didn't watch that era,  and so you don't know just how bad it was. We aren't talking about 'blown calls' we are talking about egregious, impactful calls like the one that started this thread (a BS offense call on a late-game made shot by the team's best player, followed by a manufactured ejection). That wasn't an isolated incident.   When the Raptors were blown out of the 2015 playoffs by John Wall and the Wizards, I was just happy they got fair treatment, which was a new feeling.  But you're right, I'm just a Homer with an unsupported hot take."
"John Wall, Bradley Beal, DeMarcus Cousins, Dion Waiters"
"Reddish is the best high school player I have witnessed.  &amp;#x200B;  Witnessed as in followed his high school career, and not like LBJ or John Wall where it already happened in the past."
"It wouldn't be impossible which was the point of the argument that defense is more about knowing your scheme, understanding matchups, and effort. Klay has average quickness and even in his prime no one really thought of being a great athlete. He likely makes up for this with time in the film room and just general effort on defense. He's even talked about how when he saw how good Curry was on offense he figured what he needed to bring to help the team was defense and how much he worked on getting better on that end of the court.   Also Bamba's time wasn't official that was something that was rumored to occur at a private workout. But if he actually sprinted down the court faster than John Wall that would mean he was faster than John Wall. You bring out a stopwatch because there's a difference between looking fast and being fast. There's a ton of people that look like they're moving fast but do bad when actually timed because they have a short stride length. Your eyes can lie the clock won't."
"And no Bamba is a faster sprinter than John wall. https://www.stack.com/a/gigantic-nba-prospect-mo-bamba-can-sprint-faster-than-russell-westbrook-and-john-wall  I can’t understand you thinking combine stats are going to win you this argument. People have seen klay play at his athletic peak, and to call him unathletic at that time is absurd. He’s not elite by nba standards but he is good laterally. It would be impossible for him to guard the elite guards 30+ mins a night if he were the level of athlete you’re trying to portray him as. Fact is he took the toughest backcourt matchup every night in a stacked west for years on teams that were great defensively. He’s not an elite shutdown guy but he is good because of his combo of length, lateral agility, and feel."
[Basketball Reference only gives this player a 45% chance of making the HOF] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html)  That’s in between Aldridge (51%) and John Wall (32%). He only has 1 Olympic gold and no real college success which would both impact his chances.
"John wall tore his achilles lol, although he has dealt with nagging knee issues for awhile"
Probably. Russell Westbrook is also up there. Sadly another inefficient player is oladipos teammate is John wall. 21ppg on 52% TS.
https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/john-wall-admits-facing-wizards-personal-they-thought-i-was-done  Wiz may have been right about something.  But also Houston did a terrible job with his return.
"First and foremost ; Klay deserved the contract with or without injury. He was one of the best in the game on a championship team / dynasty.      Second ; John Wall had shown his immaturity when it came to taking care of his own body. The contract is viewed as bad because when it was signed, people didn't know if Wall was going to be focused on his body and recovery. Compound that with the fact that Wall is a guard that centers his playstyle on his athleticism."
"Even if you consider it a slight overpay, it by no means was a horrible contract at the time. Klay is getting this break but he also signed a 190M dollar contract *coming off an ACL tear*. Klay isn’t KD either, in terms of personal accolades you can easily argue that John Wall has done more."
"I mean, John Wall tripped at home and tore his Achilles lol"
Klay will be immediately useful once he's back. John Wall is not useful to a good team right now.
I know John Wall parties a lot but I ain’t gonna say an NBA all star ain’t fucking motivated lmao
John Wall was probably better than Klay around 3 to 5 years ago.
"Also John Wall had work ethic, motivational  and weight problems before he got injured   Klay has never has those problems. As far as we can tell. Those are the guys that tend to age the best.   Also Klay is a top 5 shooter ever. Is this a joke post OP"
"I think Klay is gonna get really close to where he was, at least on offense. I don’t think John Wall can be back to where he was without the burst. Wall was very slightly on the decline anyway by the time he initially got injured."
"I dunno about that.  LeBron, Harden, Embiid, Giannis, Curry, Kawhi, AD, KD, I think there is zero argument those 8 are above him.  And then Dame, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Doncic, those 5 it's kind of a longshot argument, but at least I can say you're not crazy I guess.   That's 13 guys total I just don't think you can honestly argue against being better.   Now here's a thing, at this point you can argue the group, you COULD say he slots in 14 or 15, but you could also argue he doesn't: PG, Booker, CP3, Tatum, Brown, Mitchell, Zion, Lavine, Julius Randle, Ja Morant, John Wall. Again, I'm not saying these guys are all above him at all, I'm saying you can pick 2 of these guys above Beal, and it's reasonable. Personally, I'd say PG and Booker, and honestly the Boston Jays, are probably better. A lot of people still believe in CP3, I think he's a fine player but I would have Beal over him, and I don't trust Wall healthy or not above him either. I'd be truly surprised if within 2 years Randle, Ja and Zion aren't better than him too.   But nobody seems to think Morant is good this year so maybe I'm crazy on that at least, I never see anyone mention him on here."
I’ll always fw john wall for what he provided to the city
Kyrie broke his hand punching a stanchion or wall during a practice game.   Andrew Bynum injured his knee bowling.   John Wall fell over at home and tore his Achilles.
RUSSEELLL WESTRBOOK or john wall
who said John Wall isn't playing
"&gt; Team A has four solid shooters   What? John Wall, Zion &amp; AD are all paint scorers first. Andrew Wiggins has league average TS% as well. The only ""solid"" shooter (40% from 3) is Kyrie.  I know it's like your day job to hate on anything LeBron related but at least have some integrity when crafting your bullshit lmao."
Still John Wall
John Wall had an achilles injury at home.
John Wall probably the worst player not named Wiggins or Edwards in here right now.
"Hijacking top comment for memory transcript:  - Klay sounds very positive, really high spirits and had a lot of inspiring phone calls with other legends. One who really inspired him was Grant Hill, because he had his prime taken by injuries but battled over 3 years through injuries and setbacks and still managed to have a great career after (offtopic but still relevant because from another interview with KD but: they talk almost daily. KD was one of the first to reach out to him and help him through the process)  - KD, John Wall but also Dominique Wilkins are all great examples that he can come back at the same or even better level. Mentions how Dominique even led the league in PPG right after his Achilles tear - targets start of next season for comeback. Maybe not opening night but 2-4 weeks after. Timeline is 12 months so that's around november - expects Warriors to contend for their next chip when he's back - with his playstyle and skillset he can be effective into his late 30s - will settle for nothing less than being an all-nba player again. Way too competitive to settle for anything less than that. Will get there 100%, maybe not at the beginning of the season because he'll probably be under minute restrictions when he's back and play around 20 minutes to start with but thinks he'll get there throughout the season - the injuries definitely made him rethink his training and diet patterns and how he generally treats his body"
"Seeing how John Wall &amp; KD have come back, I'm hopeful that Klay can come back strong next season. That said, I am tempering my expectations."
Flashbacks of John Wall murdering me in 2K11's rookie showcase thing
SMH Westbrook taking shots away from John Wall and Gilbert Arenas.
Dissapointed! I thought that was the John Wall one.
"Look at that team as soon as he left. I don’t knock John Wall (he hasn’t really shown me he can lead a team out of a slump), but they are, as he said, ass. Bootycheeks. Terrible. And people were expecting Harden to pull off a miracle every season. Bet you beard called KD on some I’m tired, get me out of here."
And if they don’t they could always get Lowry or John wall in the offseason
"John Wall didn’t even play half of those, are you faulting LeBron for losing without AD?"
TO THE WINDOW...TO THE WALL   John Wall: ... ... SKEET SKEET SKEET
"&gt;No one is gonna trade for Tobias and his awful contract lmfao.   Everyone says this every year and then a bad contract gets traded.  Al Horford got traded. Andrew Wiggins got traded. John Wall got traded. Gordon Hayward ""wouldn't opt out"" and then gets a 30/4 contract.   Philly has all their assets. If you dont think there's a tanking team out there who would take a few years of an overpaid wing in exchange for assets attached, then you don't have a good awareness of the league."
"I’m a UK basketball fan at the college level and the 2010 and 2011 seasons had more puns than I’ve ever heard before and the announcers used them every.single.game   2009-2010 we had John Wall and Demarcus Cousins and Darius Miller.   “_________ team ran right into a wall tonight.”  “That’s some Cousin love right there”  “It’s Miller time in the Bluegrass!”   And a million variations of the above.   2010-2011 Brandon Knight  Doron Lamb Terrence Jones  Darius Miller    “It might be a noon tip-off, but it’s Knight-time here in Rupp arena.”  “Knight just sang them a lullaby with that crossover”  “He might be a Lamb, but he’s playing like a lion here tonight.”  Again, “It’s Miller time!”  And.every.single.”Basketball Jones”.pun.you.can.think of  Announcers had fun that year."
"LeVert is the new prime John Wall, statistically.  Biggest strength is passing and ball distribution.  Can provide high volume but mediocre efficiency scoring."
" It's a joke. He had this to say about John Wall during his rookie year:  ""Let me tell you something: I'm a big believer, when it comes to quarterbacks and point guards. Who's your dad? Who's your dad? Because I like confrontational players, I don't like passive aggressive. Strong families equal strong leaders. Talent? Overrated. Leadership? Underrated. And you can say, well, Colin, can you just go out and say anything crazy and get people to e-mail. That's not the point. You wouldn't e-mail if I was an idiot, because you wouldn't listen to the show. You listen to the show because we make good points.  ""I simply have a different opinion than you do on John Wall. I like the character of Derek Fisher, the rebounding and distribution ability of Rajon Rondo, that's what I like. That's what I want from my point guards. You celebrate the assists more than the buckets.....I know he's great. So don't confuse [me saying] John Wall's no good. No, John Wall's an A+ talent. I don't think he's ever gonna be an A+ win-championships point guard."""
"Yes, I’d say he’s pretty well-above average as far as number 1 picks go. I usually think of Blake Griffin and John Wall when I think of #1 picks who met but didn’t exceed expectations. Kyrie has definitely surpassed them by this point imo"
"Is 4 years of Ben Simmons making 33 up to 40 million worth very much to a team that’s also paying John Wall 40-47 million a year for half that time? Simmons is a young all star, but he’s a bad fit with John Wall since neither of them can shoot well, and I don’t think a team paying $80 million to those two even makes the playoffs in the west.   Once they get off Wall’s contract, they have 2 years left with a young all star on a losing team who probably wants out by that point. Even if they traded for Simmons, they’d be stuck in mediocrity and wouldn’t have a clear path to being a strong playoff team before his contract is up anyways. Getting a boatload of picks and tanking just seems like a better option at that point"
"Christian Wood and John Wall are pretty good second and third options. Eric Gordon is a good 6 man. John Wall's stats this season are not much different than when he was in his prime other than reduced assists. Had they been healthy, they would've been in the mix for the 8-10 seed without Harden."
U guys could have had caris levert and jarett allen together with Christian wood and john wall.
"Ben Simmons, Ja Morant, John Wall"
John wall
I play with Asians so I get called John Wall cuz I'm the only one who runs
Bro if your a warriors fan you should know good and well Draymond is a better passer than guys like Ben Simmons and John Wall
It’s at like 28% this year....  Obviously it was down when he was playing with John Wall.
"This has been brewing for some time though, not just this season.  Tillman handcuffed Morey by not wanting to go into the luxury tax.   Wouldn't even let him use the full MLE to get a player.   Tillman didn't want to pay D'Antoni who has been probably a top 5 coach in the NBA the last 5 years?   Said CP3's contract was the worst in the NBA then okayed a Russ who's arguably on worse deal then sent Russ away for John Wall who's contract imo is the actually the worst.   It may not be all his fault but it's gotta be like 75% his fault, right?"
"It seems the Cavs just wanted to get him off the organization. John Lucas is a guy in our organization known for helping players get their shit together, so some people are thinking they really just wanted the best for the kid by sending him here. I can’t think of a better place in the league for him to learn it’s now or never to get it together than with John Wall and John Lucas."
"I think most NBA guys are too tall and not fast enough.  NFL receives have to either be insanely fast, agile or strong.  NBA guys don't train like NFL receivers, so aside from burners like John Wall, De'Aaron Fox, or a young Westbrook, they'd just get bullied at the line."
They got lucky that John Wall needed KPJ to help him chase the playoff spot
Yeah that’s totally unfair to John Wall
Did u just compare Trae to John Wall? GTFO
Trae can shoot. But 36% doesn’t make him an elite shooter like his fans think he is. He should take less threes and be much more selective. He’s still a good player and puts points on the board. He’s excellent on the drive and is a great facilitator. He wants to be Steph when he should be more like John Wall or Harden
"I don't know if it's the biggest 'what if' for Washington, but I wonder ""what if John Wall didn't bust his hand against the Hawks in the 2015 playoffs?""  It happened in the 3rd quarter of Game 1, but despite that injury, John Wall stayed in the game and Washington won on the road. They had momentum and Teague and Schroeder couldn't stop him.  The next game the starting PG was Ramon Sessions, who was pretty good at getting to the free throw line, but not nearly as good as Wall in any other areas of the game. It was a much easier matchup for the next 3 games, despite Washington taking a victory on a Paul Pierce game winner.  That team would not have won a championship, but I think that they would've advanced to the ECF.  My other 'what if' for Washington is ""what if they piss away their resources in the 2016 offseason?"" Lots of questionable decisions made that summer, which didn't advance the team add any star power or expand on the team's depth."
The first three have prior experience. John wall has been invited before. Guards aren't something they ever lack.
John Wall and Oladipo made it but not Ja lmao
"You guys can tell me if I’m being a homer here, but how are Derrick White, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard, and John Wall on this list and Ja Morant isn’t? How the fuck does that make sense?"
WTF?? even John Wall and Oladipo are there lmaoo
"No, would be dumb to bring him back until he’s absolutely 130%. KD and John Wall went that route, they really haven’t missed a step"
Will he be able to come back and play at the same high level given time? He’s gonna be 32 halfway through next season. Obviously other high caliber guys like PG/Hayward/KD/John Wall were all able to come back and still perform like their old self but i mean an achilles and a torn acl b2b can’t be good and he’s on the wrong side of 30s now.
"For UK, you should definitely move Randle to the bench, put Book and Murray at the wings, and probably have Fox as starting PG.  Also, wild the John Wall, Demarcus Cousins and Eric Bledsoe are old men getting bumped from the rotation now."
"Aldrige and Gay for John Wall. I mean, Spurs want an asset, right?"
"Iirc, in the early 80s detroit was actually just the opposite, playing fast and loose and putting up and allowing stupid numbers  Similar to the John Wall-less wizards from the last two years  Edit: obviously not what you were talking about but it's been a hard day and spewing half remembered basketball knowledge always makes me feel better lol"
"I never liked Dwight Howard.    I never liked Carmelo Anthony.   I already respected Chris Paul.     I wasn't too familiar with John Wall, but he seems dedicated."
"I could be wrong, too.  I'm basing it off of a local doctor's advice, and I'm sure John Wall is speaking to much better doctors haha."
I’m from Raleigh so probably John Wall.
This is just what John Wall said when he was pissed about people saying his career would be over. I’m assuming that he was told this by his surgeon (who i would guess is more than reputable). he made it sound like a partial tear doesn’t harm your explosiveness as much as a full rupture
"Oh yeah man.   I watched Beal and Wall in the playoffs in Toronto. My girlfriend wasn’t much of a basketball fan, and was a casual Raptor fan, but she fell in love with John Wall. She couldn’t get over how good he was"
"**TEAM KD RETURNS TO WASHINGTON**  Flash back to 2016. Fans of the Washington Wizards rejoice as hometown hero Kevin Durant announces that he's taking his talents to D.C. to rejoin his old coach Scottie Brooks (recently hired). Immediately, many peg the group as a true contender despite only finishing 41-41 the season before.  The Wizards start a little rockier than some expected, given the youth on the roster. After all, Beal (23 years old) and Bogdanovic (year 3 year in NBA) have not fulfilled their full potential yet.  At the same time, the overwhelming talent of prime John Wall and Kevin Durant proves to be difficult for the league to handle. Wall takes charge as an alpha dog leader and attack dog in transition, showcasing his underrated vision and passing ability. KD passively aggressively snipes to the media that Wall is the ""best PG he's ever played with,"" leading to a surly Westbrook press conference the next day.  Overall, it's hard to argue with the results. Durant helps lead the team to an immediate +15 game turnaround (going 56-26), winning MVP honors in the process. Wall leads the league in assists (11.1) and earns 2nd team All-NBA honors.  Of course, the true test comes in the playoffs and -- more specifically -- the Eastern Conference Finals where Durant matches up with rival LeBron James (still on Cleveland.) The series is an instant classic, with KD and LeBron trading punches, and sidekicks Wall and Kyrie Irving having their own big games here and there. The teams head into Game 7, deadlocked at 3-3.  In that final game, it turns out to be Kevin Love who provides the difference. Love catches fire and hits 5-7 threes, leading to a 26 point barrage that helps the Cavs slip by and head to the Finals once again.  The Wizards go home disappointed, but hopeful that they can be right back in the title mix as Bradley Beal continues his ascent."
2016-17 Wizards if KD came home   PG: John Wall  SG: Bradley Beal  SF:  Bojan Bogdanovic  PF: KD  C: Marcin Gortat
"I'm so glad KD and John Wall are playing at the level they're playing at right now, especially KD. It would be a great pity for all basketball fans if a player of his caliber got his career shortened because of an injury."
"I don't understand what Houston is even doing anymore  Wood has been injured. They waived Cousins when they literally have 0 centers. Every game somebody new is either resting or injured. Wall and Oladipo/Gordon (whichever is not out that day) are surrounded with basically G-league talent forcing them to chuck shots every game.   I guess Houston is tanking and they got a pick for Westbrook, so probably Houston. I'm convinced John Wall still on the Wizards could match their 14-20 record currently."
"Rockets, yeah the pick isn't much, but I really think Wizards fumbled by trading John Wall if they're trying to make a push.  He's had some good moments, and I still like his guard defense.  I think his biggest problem is he's being asked to do too much with Houston, i don't think he's a 30% USG guy, but a guy that would look real nice next to an engine, like Beal."
plenty of people used to prefer John wall over Westbrook before Westbrooks mvp season
"Don’t worry man, us Wizards fans appreciate him.  He copped a tonne of hate when he started playing fir the Rockets. But our organisation understands that talents like Russ don’t just grow on trees, even if it did hurt losing our guy in John Wall who pretty much was DC in a nutshell."
lol. John Wall is gonna be the longest tenured Rocket after this all
"Just random factoid, but apparently John Wall had only played in 37 playoff games. Makes sense because Wizards but wow"
John Wall is not better than either of those guys and definitely not Reggie Jackson tf
So you're suggesting John Wall should leave 30 million on table to increase LeBum's chip chance because as a LeBronsexual you want it?  Get that weak shit out of here.
You do not sell low. That is stocks 101. you HOLD John Wall until he can increase his trade value from albatross to at least salary dump levels.
John Wall isn’t better than Reggie Jackson
If I were John Wall I would not give up $30M
I’d do the same if John Wall took 30 shots to get 20 points
I think he means buy out John Wall tbh
"It’s hard to call right now, Beal is peaking late and looks incredible while Draymond was amazing over a 5 year stretch when the John Wall led Wizards were half decent. I think the Wizards go draymond in hindsight but let’s check in again 5 years from now because Beal just showed us what he’s made of"
"2015- now has to be the golden age for point guards. Curry, russ, dame, cp3, lowry, kyrie, john wall, kemba, trae young, Ja and co. are an extremely strong class."
"If nothing else pans out, you could always get John Wall for cheap.  Well, the salary won't be cheap... But the trade value would be."
John Wall szn.
"If you think John Wall won’t fit, you haven’t been watching him play for the past decade."
"the value of the player contracts are the primary assets held on the books of major sports teams, and those can very well depreciate over time. Think of albatross deals like John Wall, which the Houston Rockets are stuck paying since it’s guaranteed"
Lmao you know it's an old flair that I haven't changed because I like john wall?  Try again buddy 🤣
"John Wall isn’t even on his team, this dude don’t even know who plays where"
John Wall and D Rose the fastest point guards of all time lol
John Wall is the only thing that will bring Rockets fans to the arena or watching at home.  He will be the What if ? guy who never lived up to being drafted 1st overall.
This is a bs story. The rockets were not concerned about how the aftermath of trading harden would fit with John fucking Wall
Has Drummond ever been anything besides an inefficient scorer? John Wall has always taken pride in his basketball IQ and that’s something that doesn’t diminish with age.
"Well Drummond also played a little differently compared his usual self in Detroit/Cleveland, but he still wasn't what I'd call ""good"". John Wall does have class that Drummond does not so it's not a fair comparison."
EASY!  Wall and Jalen Green backcourt  Move KPJ back to the SF spot like he did in Cleveland but he can still be the secondary ball handler  John Wall can still play the mentor role/ tank commander
"John Wall and his contract are an insurmountable barrier to the Rockets being serious contenders. There's no point in trying to think about how you could contend with John Wall, because obviously you can't.  Why let his contract do even more damage?"
John wall seems pretty fair to me
...The Rockets let John Wall affect their thinking on their James Harden trade?
Grant is underpaid. We can also argue that half the players in the NBA are underpaid because they earn less than John Wall despite producing much more value.   But I agree that $25m is way too much for Jackson.
"We loved John Wall as kids. Like fucking loved John Wall. Even to this day he's the coolest fucking dude. Fifth grade everyone was wearing them ziggs everyone was dougieing and doing the lil 💪👊💪👊 John Wall dance. We were all screaming ""johhhnnnn wallll"". Prime wall was so exciting so lit. Mad athletic with crazy handles great passer. Used to always make these sick ass passes after sucking in the defense when he drove the lane. Coolest fucking dude. We loved him."
Didn’t John Wall re injure himself slipping in his own home
John Wall might regress to John Fence
"“Tony Parker was the closest and I even think Ben is faster than that,” Brown said, via Michael Pina of SB Nation. “There are times when we all think ‘oh he’s really fast.’ What I do is count the steps from foul line to foul line and there aren’t many. Count the dribbles. There aren’t many. He covers ground quicker than anybody I think that I’ve ever coached and the closest would be Tony.  ”And you’d all go back and you’d look at Russell Westbrook, maybe early days Derrick Rose. John Wall. Like, those greyhounds that just take off. But really, forget your stopwatch, count the dribbles and count the steps. He is elite when it comes to that part of the game.”  According to private data provided to SB Nation by NBA Advanced Stats, Simmons’ top recorded speed this year was 19.7 miles per hour, which translates to him racing the length of a court in roughly 3.25 seconds.   Direct quote above  If the Raptors try to get Simmons for OG, the 76ers laugh and hang up.  I like OG a lot but he’s not the same level as Simmons.  Some stats might say OG is number 2 in defensive versatility but from the games I’ve seen, I’d say:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Giannis  3. Kawhi 4. Healthy Issac  5. OG  Paul George, Tatum, playoff LeBron (might be too old now), Covington, Gordon, Butler, Bam, Smart, and Jrue are very versatile defensively too"
"Thanasis. I would like nothing more than for the Clippers to acquire him for 100% basketball reasons but he's also the most likeable guy ever.  Family-wise, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have him legally re-brothered as Kawhi's brother.  Also John Wall."
Wall? As in John Wall?
Racists use a lack of a father figure as a club to attack black people all the fucking time. Even if there was a father figure. Colin Cowherd did the same thing with John Wall when he was critizing his dancing on the court.
"There’s really no reason to have Isiah top 10. He gets way to much credit for his two rings on the most balanced team ever, but people nowadays have somehow rewritten that story as him being some clear star. When they won he scored under 20 ppg on terrible efficiency and poor defense, and didn’t make all-nba either year. The pistons win in 89 and 90 with any all star caliber point guard. Guys like Billups, Mark Price, Kevin Johnson, John Wall or Russ would’ve easily won with that ridiculous supporting cast."
john wall is the answer. Take him. Thank you.
"In the last 13 years, since 2007, five guards - Anthony Edwards, Markelle Fultz (yikes), Kyrie Irving, John Wall, and Derrick Rose - have been taken #1.      Only Fultz was a mistake IMO."
"I mean, look at the odds for any other single pick lmao. Draft isn't a science but you definitely have the best chance with 1.  This way of looking at it also ignores outcomes where you get a really really good player at #1 who just happens to not be the absolute best in the draft. Hakeem is the best player in almost any draft, just happened to be in the same class as MJ. AI and Kyrie were/are both excellent players that just happened to have all-timers hiding in the late lottery range. John Wall is the 2nd best career in that class and could have been argued as 1 at points. Blake Griffin was in MVP consideration at a certain point even though he was obviously not Harden/Steph. Derrick Rose won an MVP but got derailed by injuries. I think it's hard to truly feel bad about those picks."
Why? 1/3 of getting the best player is really damn solid odds  The average #1 pick is like a John Wall/Blake Griffin caliber guy
I seem to recall John Wall accusing him of targeting his injured hand when Dennis was on the Hawks.
John Wall doesn't slip in the shower.
john wall isn't top 5 either though ?
Oh fuck us getting John Wall don’t you dare put that evil on us.
Gilbert Arenas on the wizards. And really John Wall on the Wizards.
John Wall? More like John Cant-Throw-The-Ball!  HAHHAHAHHHAAHAH
"I lived in DC for 5 years and literally there are not a lot of Wizards fans. If you go to a game it’s like always 40-50% fans of the visiting team. It’s a polite fan base because they really don’t have that many. It was a lot more passionate during the peak John wall era, but still not really a good fan base"
tbf if there’s one thing basketball reference is historically bad at it’s HOF likelihood percentages. Giannis is at 48% and Blake Griffin is at 52. Draymond’s at 38% and John Wall is more likely to make it than Jokic.
He also purposefully tried to take out John Wall when he was playing with an injured wrist.
"John Wall is not on the Wizards either, that doesn't mean I'll be happier if Beal wins a ring without Wall.  Also CP3 and PJ Tucker are not on the Rockets either."
"The league has become so 3 point oriented that it seems hard to win with guards who can't shoot at an elite level. You could compare him to someone like John Wall. In a weak conference he can be the #1 option on a 4-5 seed, but you probably need an elite supporting cast to get the most out of him.  In theory, Hield should complement him well. Not sure why it isn't working out in practice. They don't have much up front, which is also an issue. It seems to me like Fox would work best on a team with lots of shooters around him who can capitalize on his driving ability by hitting open looks."
"The rockets are not looking good, terrible owner, John wall on the books, their best young player and their best player might both be headcases."
"Assuming we draft jalen he’s going to get a lot of shots. Wood is also a guranteed 20-25. And there’s that whole John wall situation, a lot more mouths to feed them it seems like"
Rockets are sitting there with John Wall and a bunch of 20-30 1st round picks.
"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."
"I haven’t looked in a while, but John Wall used to always tweet “Thankful for anotha day #blessed”"
I basically agree with everything you said. Multi time all star at minimum. And John Wall is about the average of what should be expected of a 1st overall pick.
"Especially when players are as young as our guys. This max is not the same as John Wall, or shit I mean even CP3s contract was considered negative value 1-2 years ago. Otto Porter was still traded. People are acting like this would cripple us for years despite the fact that Schlenk has a reputation for win-win trade approaches. It’s not like teams are going to start screening his calls"
"I would sign him to a 3-year fat contract and run it back with the same squad and just hope we don't get injured again. Worst case scenario he's salary filler for a trade some time down the line as an expiring, so it'd be better to give him a bigger contract for fewer years. We could trade him + kuzma + picks for john wall I guess lol"
John Wall
"The fat guy who partied and whined his way out of Houston? The guy who quit on his team, pushed out a hall of famer, and couldn’t work with Westbrook and then refused to even try with John Wall? Yes, let’s ask that guy about what makes a quality team mate."
Prime John wall would be an ideal fit with zach
Zach LaVine and John Wall.  I play them on 2K and they’re very good together lol
"I didn’t say just Irving and Love. Every team the Warriors faced that year PG was injured Jrue Holiday, Pat Bev, Mike Conley plus Chris Paul was injured and John Wall. I mean hell the Thunder didn’t even make playoffs due to KD and Russ injuries it was a weird year."
John Wall but I'd want picks for taking on Simmons' contract since it's longer.
Please just someone take John Wall
John wall + Eric Gordon + 2 1st for Ben Simmons p
"Playing with a higher pace allows teams to score more easily, if brooks was pushing the team to get out in transition then that is strong offensive game planning. I don’t really see how thats a negative  In the last 4 seasons the Wizards ranked in the upper half of the league in offensive efficiency, 2 of those seasons were without John Wall and they had to start IT in 2020 and Satoransky in 2019. Those teams shouldn’t be sniffing anywhere close to the top 10 in offensive efficiency   Look im sure brooks is an awful coach but that doesn’t mean he cant be a capable offensive coordinator"
"they gotta be trolling lol, i'd trade john wall in a heartbeat for simmons"
Are u kidding us ? Ben simmons is so much valuable than John Wall
"Rockets gets:: Simmons + Maxey or Thybulle + the 2nd round picks that they have  Philadelphia gets: John Wall  Why Rockets does this: Simmons is 24, Wall is 30. They get a young player and some 2nd round picks."
"Oh I thought you had something in mind lol  I don’t doubt our team would make a trade if it came to it. We just traded John Wall who was with us for over a decade, the second longest tenured player with one team in the entire League.  He was our franchise, our new GM has no hesitation making moves if he feels it’s the right thing to do."
John Wall sitting on the side line In street cloths isn’t fun.
If John Wall can return to form totally be worth it
"Damn, John Wall should be mad lol  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/emmanuel-mudiay/"
We'll give them five time all star John Wall and the 24th pick.
Five time all star John Wall and the 24th pick.
"I mean it was the only way they could keep Zach Lavine which might not work anyway he could ask to leave if things go bad this season. I would love to see John Wall on this team not sure if the money would work, but that be a fun team"
"Mood man. I'm off here in the Philippines and til this day, we still do the John Wall whenever we hang out"
"r/KPJ is grateful for this. There hasn’t been issues since the Cavs, in the “Gubble”, and the Rockets next to John Lucas and John Wall, Jae’Sean Tate (also had a parent murdered), and others."
That john wall contact is definitely one of the worst of recent ages. He missed the first 3 seasons of the contract as well..
"Dude, you’re saying a rookie on a rookie contract like Ayton is less valuable than John Wall because Wall makes $42 million?   That has to be the stupidest opinion I’ve read today and one guy one here thinks that the sons would’ve won a championship if everyone in the NBA was healthy."
Yeah you’re right but due to injuries and his contract John wall is now a punchline and that sucks
"oof.  Kawhi wouldn't have been the same player without the development he had with the Spurs, but John Wall with Klay would have been filthy."
John wall is the best finenesser in the league
John Wall is that dude
"I just think they were a little premature on deciding that Chris Paul - who had warranted 160 million only 2 years prior - was on the decline as an athlete. Injury history has always been something to consider with this man but his mvp level play has always been above and beyond when on the court. If we really want to look at the pieces that weren’t working towards a championship for the rockets I think unfortunately we have to look at James harden. I’m not talking in terms of marketability or return on investment from superstardom but from only a perspective of winning I think we can question James ability to win, especially considering he cud not get it done with Kevin Durant twice and the likes of Russell, John wall, and of course Chris Paul."
"John Wall might be the second most successful thief in American history, after Bobby Bonilla."
"Tank Commander John Wall leads Houston to a chip, subscribe"
Yes but there are like 300 comments taalking aabout that topic and you picked the one poking fun att John Wall being a taank comander  &amp;#x200B;  Kinda weird
"Damn, wishing I was John Wall right about now 😂😂😂"
Hum sure but why are you talking about it in the one thread here thats about John Wall being a good tank comander xD
As an amateur fan can someone tell me what John Wall has done in the last 5 years that is meaningful? Any deep playoff runs or anything? I see his name often
Imagine turning down Ben Simmons for John Wall.
Now we need someone to create letters from the front by Tank Commander John Wall like they did with Andrew Luck
Remember when John Wall lambasted Reggie Jackson for making the same amount of money as him some injury free years ago? “Pepperidge Farms Remembers” lol
"Nah, the D-Town Boogie(the dance known as The Dougie) had existed long before John Wall"
lol Troop 41! They played at a frat party at my school when I was in college at the height of the songs popularity. Definitely went just to hear the John Wall
John Wall and Kristaps Porzingis are the true capitalists. Stealing money with 0 results.
"I agree with the John Wall trade 100%, but if we're all gonna sit here and act like we knew cp3 was gonna have a resurgence in health and play then we just making shit up tbh lol  Also let's not act like the Harden/Westbrook team got much of a chance before it was called quits, they had one injured playoff run and lost against the eventual champions. Call me crazy, but a healthy Harden/Westbrook team runs through this injured Western Conference  All respect to CP3 for his great resurgance and making the finals with the Suns, but everyone is having revisionist history lol"
John wall likely picking up his player option is the most “well duh” statement I have seen in a long time
"First time I heard the term ""Millennial"" was when some draft analyst predicted John Wall would be the Magic Johnson for the Millennial generation. I had no idea what he meant but it got me going so I had a lot of time for that era of Wizards teams."
Pretty sure it’s a John Wall joke
"&gt; LakersYeah.  His movement skills are unbelievable.  He's got rare start/stop ability.  Which as you pointed out is a lot like Harden.A lot of that comes down to their strength.  Kawhi has that too.  Can just run full speed, absorb contact and stop on a dime. It may not LOOK athletic but if you were on the court with them you'd definitely feel it.3ReplyGive AwardShareReportSave   &gt;   &gt;level 4Chemical-Asparagus25 · 16hHarden is definitely jump out of gym athleticism, have you seen his first step and deceleration?Luka also moves better than most 6'7 guys I'd imagine even though he is average speed.Curry has ridiculous stamina and balance but once could argue he trained for those, rather than have those as intrinsic qualities.4ReplyGive AwardShareReportSave   &gt;   &gt;level 4Misanthropic\_Cynic · 14h  Yeah Harden is also mischaracterized as not being explosive. He ran a faster 3/4 court sprint time than John Wall and he had a 37.5 inch max one-step vert and he had like a 32-inch standing vert. Then he's strong as an ox and can decelerate with the best of them. Usually, a high free throw rate is a great indicator of burst (shiftier guards who look to avoid contact, this isn't as true for)."
Bro if Horford and John Wall can get traded. KP can get traded. Someone out there believes they can revive KP guaranteed.
john wall or kemba at point
I was so upset when they went 12-70 only to get Derrick Favors instead of John Wall.
"There are reasons for everything. My point was that there a lot of guys before AD that I would call ""street clothes"". Boogie and Blake used to be stars. Boogie was easily a top 3 center before his injuries a few years ago. Klay hasn't played in two years. John Wall is another guy that's out a lot. There's a thread in the Lakers subreddit that uses facts/numbers to dispel the notion of AD always being injured."
"still john wall was just ass. even when wood came back he was chucking and bricking. even if they have to tank, it would be better to give their young guys more touches than lame wall"
lmao the rockets season was all over the place they didnt plan this shit from the beginning. it would have been better for them if john wall was actually better than kp so they could dump him for some picks and young assets. he's just ass and easily the worst contract in the league. the organization has just been a mess
John Wall has entered the chat
"I would take John Wall's contract over KPs contract if I'm trying to win in the next 2-3 years.  If I want to take a gamble further down the road, I'd probably take KP. But as a team, I'd be concerned with KP's brother demanding more than fair market value for KP once his contract is up and at that point Wall and KP are the same because you're not getting more than 2-3 years out of them."
John wall played a big part in the Rockets being so bad
"If John wall, Westbrook, horford can all be moved, KP can as well. There is a tanking team that will take a positive asset you have with the contract.  It may not be a home run move, but it will be a move that will either clear cap space or provide you with a vet that can contribute"
But John Wall did get traded.
"Damn, worse than John Wall or KLove?"
"Especially the way the NBA works now.  Zion may want out New Orleans at some point, but seeing how other superstars have managed to get their way out of situations after signing their max deals, its stupid not to.  I'd rather be the guy who everyone rates for a huge contract than the guy who declines a big offer and then gets cents on the dollar later on, IE John Wall vs Nerlens Noe.  Different scenario...but still...take the money, make moves later."
Love wall but I’m glad we got that supermax off our books. Westbrook’s is pretty identical but we were not gonna make the playoffs if we stuck w/ John
Yall want john wall?
"John Wall, most expensive tank commander in the league"
JOHN WALL  /s
John Wall is gonna make like 80 million over the next 2 years
John Wall actually. Porzingis can somewhat play.
John Wall.  He was one of the worst big minute players in the league and is still owed 92 mil over the next 2 seasons
I'm so stupid. I can't believe I forgot Fox. John Wall and Derrick White being in the pool but not Ja and Fox is wild.
John Wall is also a better player. He run an offense and defend well.
"In the short term I think so. He plays with a chip on his shoulder and has stated before that he wants to prove he's worth a max contract at the end of this contract, this team gives him a great opportunity for that because he will be very key in the offense. I'm not sure he will get the same opportunity to be quite as involved on a competing team. I don't know that his primary goal is winning a championship right now as much as proving himself as a player. One more season of development/tanking I don't think will bother him. He'll also be just about to turn 28 at the end of his contract which is a perfect timeline for him to earn a max if he's ever going to.   But that third and final season of his contract could be key, the 22-23 season. If we don't start showing signs by then of at least being on track to become a playoff team then I wouldn't be surprised at him leaving to go elsewhere at the end of his contract. And really at that point if he's indicating that, we should consider trading him because his bird rights will be very valuable to a competing team, not to mention the potential playoff boost he'd give for that season without having to match much salary to get him. My hope as a Rockets fan is that we are looking good at that point between the hopefully top 4 rookie we draft this year and our young guys developing.  The 22-23 season is going to be huge for us in general. Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, and Jae'Sean Tate will all be up and they are right now basically our future core. We'll also have a ton of cap room because John Wall will be finally off the books and Eric Gordon's contract goes unguaranteed so we could cut him if we wanted."
"It's still *probably* John Wall, but at least Wall is down to 2 years (including the player option).  KP has 3."
I'm sorry is this a thread about John Wall?
KP and a FRP for John wall?
Just do the dive like John Wall/Marcus Smart
God I rest this yesterday as John Wall and just didn’t ask any questions and kept scrolling
It sets up for another Westbrook / John Wall type trade.  There's always going to be a few big names underperforming on big contracts.  Usually one of the only options is to swap them in some form or another.
John wall probably average more
"1. Lebron it I’m speaking honestly, but if you ask me I’ll say Kobe  2. Lebron as far being an all around player, Kobe as far having the takeover mentality, and Steph because he shoots from everywhere   3. Newer fans may not have realized how good John Wall was, he was always the faster player on the court and was a top PG before 3 point shooting became as important as it is today.  With that being said, Derrick Rose was faster and more athletic and was leading a top team in the league as the youngest MVP ever, and one random jump stop took that all away.  The fact that after all the surgeries he’s still in the league and was arguably the Knicks best player in the playoffs speaks to how great his talent was despite his injury history and him losing the explosiveness that made him so hard to guard  4. 1 and 2 the next five to seven are Luka and Giannis  5. Luka and Emoni Bates.  I think he’s gonna take the league by storm"
"John wall for zingis , find a way to get wood or olynk"
i remember years were john wall was the only guy to reliably bring the ball up the court.
Okay let’s stop. Porzingis is not good but he is much better than Kevin Love and John Wall is terrible now.
John Wall and Kevin Love can actually somewhat contribute and not be a liability.   Wall can be a decent point guard and Kevin Love a floor spacer with elite rebounding.   Wtf can Porzingis do?
John Wall... KEvin Love?  Come on dude
"trade KP for john wall, problem solved."
I agree but I don’t think KP is a negative asset as compared to say a Kevin Love or John Wall. I agree he’s not holding them back from a salary cap perspective but I think from a team building perspective they need to go in a different direction . Mavs don’t have their 1st the next two years and Lukas due for an extension soon I think Cuban needs to continue to show they are committed to winning
Mavs need JOHN WALL
"Nah, I saw way more attention on the post where Steph baited John Wall into diving for the rolling ball just to pick it up and hit a 3.  [All I found was a bad quality youtube though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deqPtJhrrzY)"
Less than John Wall though
John wall.
John Wall lmfao
"The cap space hit really isn’t that big of a deal for the Mavs. They’re still able to open up max cap space this summer aren’t they?  It won’t really be an issue until Luka’s rookie contract is over since Luka + Zingis make less per year than Russell Westbrook or John Wall. They still have plenty of room for another Max contract.   Obviously, the Mavs wish they were paying him less, but I’m not sure free agency this season has anyone you’d rather give a max contract too. Plus, they still got Hardaway in that deal and he’s been great for them."
"Was basically gonna say this. It’s like Ginoboli was....he looks awkward AF out there because he starts and stops and seemingly randomly changes direction so much, but it’s actually extremely athletic to point where no one else can do it. He goes from 0 to 100 almost instantly out of all of it too, it’s incredible.  But yeah we definitely think of fast like John Wall even though all he can do with that speed is run in a straight line at the basket."
john wall. he may be ass and a worse contract but at least he could run an offense for 15 minutes and give luka a breather
John wall and kevin love are worse. He might take 3rd tho
Contact?  Like his weed dealer?  In all seriousness.  John Wall is the answer till proven otherwise.
** John Wall has entered the chat **
I'd give you John Wall but atleast he has one less year on his contract
John Wall is definitely the worst
"So Dallas, John Wall for Porzingis, you in ?"
"John Wall is a lot worse, but I’d say Porzingis is up there, probably top 5"
John Wall exists
John Wall makes $91 million over the next 2 seasons.
trying not to end up like John Wall vs. Steph
"I rmb seeing his hs video and it hyped me more than anybody since AD and John Wall LOl.  He was like 16 and he was so smooth already, like KD"
And?  No one seemed to defend Harden after Demarcus said that.  John Wall also didn't seem happy with Harden's attitude based on reporting
John Wall is available for free if we keep our top4 pick
You ain’t slick sneaking John Wall in there
yeah but how does he stack up to prime John Wall athleticism?
Can't be wilder than John Wall stans.
Lonzo Ball  Kyle Lowry  Devonte Graham  John Wall (trade)  Kemba Walker (trade)  POSSIBLY Russell Westbrook (trade)  POSSIBLY Damian Lillard (trade)  POSSIBLY Derrick Rose (free agency)
"Not that John Wall is the same stratosphere of player but physically he's come back from devastating injuries and he's quite nimble, like you wouldn't know he had an achilles tear. In regards to physical health, he was impressive this year. It was crazy to see Cousins make a comeback but you could tell how much the injury took from him. David Nwaba too, he is still crazy athletic."
So true! We had way more upside with the john wall contract!
"Yea they do in a way, but, in general, they make me root against the franchise but not really the team.   Like the rockets, for example, I want them to convey good picks by being shit but at the same time I really like John Wall, KPJ, &amp; Christian Wood so I want them in particular to play well and have success that brings their teammates success.   With the Clippers I just feel meh towards their team &amp; don’t root for any of their players, on top of already wanting their picks.   Although, it’s easier to root for a lotto team than already cemented playoff team so this point prob don’t even matter"
"Idk, we seen Beal blossom when John Wall got injured then traded.  Could be the same deal.  Just spit ballin.  Its not like the Wiz got a ton better but Beal got alot better."
The year we missed out on John Wall. Smh
Elite defensively. Putting the pieces together offensively. Think De’aaron Fox with a prime John Wall ceiling
"There's no way around it except raising the max salary. If players like Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Harden, KD are gonna get paid the same as Mike Conley, John Wall and Kemba Walker, you bet your ass they're gonna get theirs in some other way."
"This sub takes the size of contracts personally, and conflates the number with the actual skill level of the player. It's like they can't hold two opposing thoughts in their collective head. A player can be very good and also get paid too much for some cap situations. John Wall and CJ McCollum are both very very good basketball players, even by NBA standards."
"No way, John Wall and Al Horford are still way worse. And Kevin Love"
"John Wall is still true, Wizards gave up a 1st to trade him for a similarly bad contract"
They said the same thing about John Wall and Chris Paul.
People sleeping on John Wall.
"The absolute best case scenario star they can get is someone like Kemba, Westbrook, John Wall"
"Lowry, Westbrook, John Wall, Kemba, maybe Devonte Graham will be their choices"
John wall the 2022 6th man of the year
"He averaged 16 ppg. Houston’s rebuilding team and since John Wall isn’t his usual self, behind him is Christian Wood and KPJ"
"They really don't lmfao this is such a bad take  Knicks actually have cap space, actually have picks, and actually have young players they can trade. Heat and Sixers do too. Throwing the Lakers/Clippers into the mix is just dumb, they can get someone like DeRozan or a fat contract vet PG like John Wall/Westbrook/Kemba or Lowry but there's absolutely no way they're getting Dame with their current assets   Good luck getting the Blazers to give up Dame for Kuzma + THT + KCP + Schroder + 2nd round picks or Kennard + 2nd round picks I guess"
"Yall are gonna trade for Kemba/John Wall/Russ with the Kennard contract and the second round picks, but there's NO SHOT the Clippers have anything to give up for Dame except Paul George? Which would defeat the whole point  Lakers don't have anything either I don't know where people are getting this notion from. The only playoff teams that desire Lillard that can put together realistic packages for Lillard are Sixers, Heat, Knicks"
"Having “sports opinions” like “John wall won’t be a good point guard because his father is dead” doesn’t mean I’m gonna come kill you, it means if you die in some horrific accident I’m not going to shed any tears, for ME personally"
I think this season Presti learned the value of a tank commander like John Wall. Walker will play 48 min and take 50+ shots a game for OKC
"Even at that Kyrie was a top 20 player Love wasn't.  KAT, Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, Russ, Paul George, Kawhi, Dame, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, John Wall, Kyrie, Derozan, Lowry, Hayward, Cousins (pre injury still), at absolute minimum where better than Love with more players being arguable. Y'all literally call anything a superteam."
Can I interest you in a John Wall for first round picks?
I mean if that’s the case then John Wall or Russ are it
John Wall is just not very good and if you are paying him that much money your team will just not be good at all.
Yes Jack I’m saying John wall is better than Lebron. How did you so easily reveal my true argument?!
"So Westbrook is better than Lebron by your argument. Or John Wall. In fact, ive seen Kobe be a sooky little bitch just as much as Lebron.  ItS ObVIoUs YoU CanT ReAD CoNtExT ClUeS hahahaha"
Package trade him with Luka to the Rockets to get John Wall     Obviously /s
I would not worry since everything John Wall used to do was relying on his speed and being a great athlete. Even if Klay is never the same he can still make a 3 one would think and do Klay shit. It is his defense that is the greatest question mark
"I think there's 2 parts to it. First is the aerobic fitness requirements have increased. Guys are pushing their bodies to the redline more often throughout the game. It's why we've seen the minutes played per game go down over the decades.  Second is, paradoxically, better medical treatment. Guys can come back from injuries sooner and return from injuries that would've ended careers in the past. Lebron wouldn't have had this kind of career if he'd been drafted in 1983, because they didn't have knowledge and techniques to keep guys fit for so long back then. AD could very well have had a Greg Oden career if he'd been in the league 10-20 years earlier. Guys like KD, Klay, and John Wall would be done in previous generations. So we see guys get more injuries because they're playing games they'd have missed in the 90's"
John Wall could turn many playoff teams into lottery teams.
"Yeah the world would agree without a doubt curry 1st, then Dame   But klay has been out for so long, man definitely in the running for number 2 again if he can get back to form. But after injuries like that, I really hope he doesn't have a John wall career"
John Wall is available   Pls take him
John Wall MISSED two years... Jordan LEFT for two years
There are a lot of worse contracts out there. John Wall quickly comes to mind.
"John Wall still takes the cake there, I think."
I think Russ actually might be the wizards best player. Beal is the best scorer but Russ can control a game like no one other then Lebron or CP3 can. He forces team to play at his pace regardless of what they do. I’m honestly treasuring this time with him. He’s the most exciting player we have had since 2015-17 John Wall
Oof idk about MVP anymore but I feel like Westbrook has been a lot better than what John Wall could’ve been for them.
"that john wall trade for westbrook looks like one of the most lopsided deals in NBA history  westbrook is ridiculously good and it's crazy people think he's not, he has a legit case for MVP almost every year"
john wall
"And that's the thing, separation of the team from the players. I just have an appreciation for high quality people regardless of who they play for or history with my teams of choice. John Wall is another good example. Just a fantastic person in regards to community support and community engagement."
"John Wall- No chill Gil- Beal of Bradley Dude- Elvin Hayes- Wes Unseld, kinda underrated but for all time, it is underwhelming"
"This narrative that Gordon's contract is horrible needs to stop.  It's 2 more years of less than $20M each year.  When he is healthy, his play is absolutely worth the dollar figure... he scores well at the rim and from deep and has great on-ball defense. The only problem is that the guy gets injured way too often.  If he is healthy next year, Houston will get an asset for him at the deadline (if they choose to sell him).  If you are talking about taking a bad contract to take on Wood, you are talking about taking on John Wall.  That said, Houston has no reason to sell a 25-yr old.  You base this off the assumption Minnesota keeps their pick, but it is far more likely that Houston keeps their pick. And if they get a good player and stay healthy, they will be looking to get into the playoffs themselves.  If they lose their pick, *may*be they move Wood, but they'll find a better deal than this."
John wall is the closest injuries wise I guess
"I think the only 2 generational guys are LeBron and Steph. LeBron represented the East in the finals for 8 straight years. No one did that since Russell. I think KD has the best argument for a third generational spot but you can’t get around how his legacy is tainted. It’s hardly ever going to be something you can get around because it’s always some degree of right.  Outside of those 3, I think we should remember this as the Point Guard revolution. In there you can label CP3, subsequently DRose, Russ, and even guys like John Wall revolutionized the position from ‘10-‘15 as a tool of pace, and Harden comes in and is the best of these 5 but still chasing Steph until he gets a ring. He’ll probably go down as the best scoring point guard ever. No one has ever done what Harden has done as an engine of complete offensive decision making  and efficiency the way Harden has through his whole Houston tenure"
"Yeah it's an interesting thing, the debate between what's skill and what's athleticism. I think it can be both, but if you watch someone like Andrew Wiggins, for instance, there's just an innate difference in their movements that can't be gained through skills. Kyrie has way more mobile hips, can sink lower to the grown, can twist and turn in closer spaces and just flat-out maneuver in ways that Wiggins cannot, because Wiggins lacks the coordination and his feet aren't capable of being in those positions.   &amp;#x200B;  [https://youtu.be/w6zQb-oqQh4?t=152](https://youtu.be/w6zQb-oqQh4?t=152)  \^\^\^\^ this is an interesting look at it, looks at the positions he can get into, the angles he can move, etc. Someone like Wiggins, or a Paul George, cannot move this way, and the applicability of these traits are just as much as being quick/fast (which Kyrie is anyway) and probably more so than being able to jump super high. If Wiggins could maneuver like this, I think he might be up a tier as a player. It's a quality Kobe and MJ also had. You can do ball handling drills, all that, but this is NFL running back/cornerback body control/mobility. John Wall is kinda mediocre when it comes to this. DWade was great at it.   I'd give the athleticism nod to Wall because his raw power and maximum explosion I think give him a little bit more of an ability to get by on raw physicality, but Kyrie isn't far behind, and when I watch them, I've never seen a huge difference, all things considered. Similar speed/quickness, both strong (wall stronger), Wall has more vertical explosion, Kyrie has way better agility/mobility."
"He did one vs John Wall a few years ago, got the foul too  I just thought it was funny that he was shooting like absolute shit for an entire half and his first shot attempt in the 3rd was a post fade he rarely does, lmao man is wild"
"Current is John Wall because I can just tell from his playstyle that he doesn't want to be here and I don't want him here as a Rockets fan either. Much rather develop KPJ, Wood, Tate, and the guy we get next year if we keep our pick and if we get another guard like Cade, Suggs, or Green, Wall can seriously slow down their's and KPJ's development  All time idrk I guess Chris Paul off the top of my head because I was hella pissed that his injury cost the rockets a chip in 2018, he was washed and injured in 2019 leading to us giving up nearly our entire future for Russ, then he was suddenly back to elite in 2020 and almost knocked us out in the first round that year. I don't hate him tho im actually a fan of his impact and we were only that good in 2018 because of him as Harden has had better seasons"
"He is a natural leader. I love John wall, but he doesn’t have that quality, and it was desperately needed in DC since our coach is useless"
"I was so upset when John wall was traded. But got damn, all that is replaced with hype, excitement and respect for Russ at this point.   Let’s go wizards"
Total upgrade in personality from toxic John Wall
"You'd have to be an idiot to think that the PnR was nice only because of Wall. They both contributed equally and many fans thought that Wall can do that with any center. Yeah, no. Gortat still had to go though, declined way too much.  PS. It also showed what John was thinking, the whole ""spoon feeding"" like he was the one who gave Gortat any chance. Boy, Gortat played with Nash, got timing, screens and hands on point, then Wizards paid Mahinmi a 64/4 and well... good thing they have Westbrook now and it works nicely."
As a resident of NJ who would go to 2-3 games a year before the move to Brooklyn I can honestly say even when they were good in NJ during the Kidd Era the people of NJ weren’t all the way bought in.   South Jersey is pretty much 76ers territory and Northern NJ is a larger mix of Knicks and Nets with random teams sprinkled throughout since legacy teams like the Lakers will always have a massive fanbase.   I remember being one of 3 people who loved the Nets growing up. All of a sudden Kidd takes them to the Finals and I have random ass kids who would always wear Knicks gear calling me a poser in school for liking the Nets as they’re now wearing Nets gear.   Same kind of nonsense happened when the Nets got Vince Carter. All of a sudden everyone is acting like a lifelong fan and trying to act like the real fans are posers.   Yet when the Nets go 12-70 and get the 3rd pick overall missing out on John Wall they’re nowhere to be found.
&gt; everybody eats  John Wall : 😡
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
Kemba and John Wall.
John Wall
"But, remember John wall was on the other side of one of the trades."
"If anything, John Wall was causing us to lose games before he was shut down."
 &gt;Is John Wall worth his contract or Russell Westbrook?  Those two players get called over paid all the time. Wall specifically was called the worst contract in the NBA and people were saying that Westbrook's contract wasnt moveable.
"These dudes are chucking on a team with a 7 man rotation and that banned John Wall from playing because they might win.  NBA is not like football... you aren't gonna get shut out and you need to get your points somewhere.   We see it all the time.. players usage goes up on a shit team and you think he's a lot better than he is-- aka Drummond, Jerami Grant, Gary Harris, etc.  A team would be foolish to pay Olynk wood  tate or porter based off numbers from chucking in garbage time."
"Seems like he just didn't want to be in Cleveland. That is pretty immature though you can't help but move a player who can't behave.  For him, the best situation is to be around Vets he can learn from. I think John Wall is a great role model for him to have around."
Against KPJ who just had a 50 burger against the Bucks and tank commander John Wall sitting out.
"It may have been more luck than anything but the Rockets did pretty well for their first year of tanking in a decade (depending on what you believe about the Ben Simmons trade). They have two super interesting young players, a top pick in a great draft and some solid vets like John Wall and Olynyk. They even did a good job in secondary scouting picking up Tate and Martin Jr. I like their team a lot more than the Kings, for example, already."
"John Wall, KPJ, Jae'Sean Tate, Kelly Olynyk, Christian Wood  *Could become* a good starting 5."
"Honestly. I fucking hated watching John wall chucking shots, this season should have been full on development, not some over the hill star chucking shots.  KPJ with a big fuck you to everyone who said the rockets have nothing to look forward to."
"buy out John Wall, he gonna be a big issue for KPJ's development lol"
"bro this isn't a research paper. both guys are low 30's in age (John Wall is 30, Blake is 32), made 6+ all-stars each, and are now the two of worst contracts in the league, one of which (Blake), just got bought out. it's not rocket science, they are shells of their formers selves in their early 30s, that's not usual for multi time all-stars  compare that to what Steph (also very injury prone) is doing in his age 32 season"
"I mean at the same time it’s not like KD is fully himself. One of the big aspects of Achilles is that it really increases your propensity for picking up other injuries. KD has not really avoided this aspect. He missed over two months of the season with a hamstring injury, and has rested a bunch as well. I think everyone knew that KD didn’t rely on explosive first step on jumping ability. Really the challenge for him is to be durable going forward. Let’s see if he can make it through the playoffs before we rush to declare him an outlier positive. As an example boogie tore his Achilles and then came back and tore his quad and then came back and tore his acl. John wall also dealing with hamstring issues now."
"&gt; “The surgery is still basically bringing one end [of the tendon] up against the other and holding it together until your body lays down enough new collagen to rebuild it,” Geier said. “We haven’t really improved on that.” The biggest changes in Achilles protocols in recent years have been ramped-up rehab schedules, designed to prevent a degree of muscle weakness, and the use of platelet-rich plasma injections and stem cell treatments. However, such measures have been more successful at reducing recovery timelines than boosting prognoses. “What I don’t feel has changed is that a large percentage of players that return drop in terms of minutes played, games played and player efficiency ratings,” Geier said.  This is interesting   I’m glad KD is ballin out but in general I’m still pretty skeptical that his case is more than just an outlier and that Achilles tears still aren’t crippling injuries. John Wall we were all ready to annoint as back after his first few weeks unfortunately has not been great. Multiple impact metrics have Rodney hood as one of the worst players in the nba level bad this year  &gt; Durant is making 52.7 percent of his tightly guarded threes  Lol"
I guess it's Kenyon Martin Jr.    John Wall if you're into something more rugged.
"Watching him lead a team to a top seed while you're stuck with a rebuilding team, no draft picks, John Wall, and John Wall's contract must be brutal."
Rockets really traded Chris Paul and four draft picks for John Wall and a first round pick.
"He embarrassed Kyrie so many times, especially in those pre-Lebron-return years  Had to dig this up from way back syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2274294-there-is-no-comparing-john-wall-and-kyrie-irving-anymore.amp.html"
"Westbrook is better then John Wall, always has been.  Westbrook being better than Wall doesn’t mean we lost the trade.  We got a pick from the Wizards and Wizards got a guy who can help them get into the play-in."
*rOcKetS wOn ThE trAde!!! JoHn wAlL bEtTer”*  Russ is literally erasing Wall from Wizards history lmao
He lost me when he implied a John Wall for Russell Westbrook trade had anything to do with skills.
I love me some john wall
"I was going to mention Russ -- it depends how you view him. he might be the ultimate game breaking athlete of everyone I mentioned.  but like, now he's on his 3rd team in 3 years - the only guy you could trade him for was John Wall. Russ' scoring has been going down for a while minus a quick bump in Houston, efficiency has never been great but this is high lowest TS% since his 2nd year. he's averaging 5 turnovers a game. I think honestly we just aren't paying attention since he's on Washington.  maybe his decline is a little more gradual than the Rose/Wall/Griffin guys, but Russ is 32 and fading into oblivion here. Steph is 32 and repeating his MVP season in terms of scoring volume and efficiency. those are two different paths"
"John Wall was the real fucking deal.   Pre injuries, damn near everyone would have melted down happy if Wall dropped Wash to sign with their team."
"John Wall being ranked 400th all time in blocks is a much less interesting stat, though. You could do it by height, but good luck getting accurate numbers on that."
"the timberwolves absolutely need john wall. we will take literally anyone or absolutely nothing, just please take john wall."
John Wall is also the only active point guard on the list and he's got a couple blocks left in his career I hope. I was just looking at total numbers even for the second and third place guys.
I like to daydream about a Prime John Wall and DWade back court. Chase Down City
Fultz was supposed to be the off-ball guard who was our secondary playmaker. Fultz would have had the tools to flourish in that tole whereas all of Ben's offense revolves around him with the ball so I doubt that would have been the case. I'd be thinking moreso John Wall / Beal roles if things worked out but we'll never know because Markelle royally fucked us.
John Wall #1 tho
John wall is amazing defender. Ben simmons is likely coming for this record next
Gimmie that wholesome John Wall content and inject it into my veins
John Wall in his athletic prime was an absolute freak of nature. I'm glad he holds this record because I feel like his injury and contract diminished what his career actually was. He always turned it up a notch in the playoffs too. His 2017 run was underrated.
"Assist hunting is definitely a thing that can be negative...guys can be overly ball dominant trying to make sure they get the assist rather than make the right play...there’s lots of ways it can show on the court...like not allowing other guys who can create off the dribble to do so or coming off p&amp;r s and not trusting to make the simple drop pass to the big bc he can than pass it to the corner or lob threat for the assist...it’s a nuanced thing in basketball...rondo was like this in his prime, Russ is like this a lot of times..john wall sometimes...if you play basketball at a certain level you’ll know the difference"
"This right here. It's sad tbh. I was rooting for John Wall, but he seems to have dropped off a cliff."
"Because nobody cared about the Rockets after that trade tbh.   Also they were doing fine right after the deal, then Wood went down, everything went to hell and now they are just in tank mode. Didnt help that John Wall unfortunately just isnt good anymore either."
"Yeah I think you’re 100% right about point 2. Some old school guys don’t even know what a double double is lol. As for the first point, that’s fair. I’m not trying to do the “he played against plumbers” thing but I do think Russ is playing in a league that is pretty saturated with talent right now. You could say that about a lot of eras but he has had to compete for guard spots against Kobe, Harden, Curry, John Wall, Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, and some other guys I’m definitely forgetting."
"All very good points, you'd probably in that situation have to double down though, and trade an injured Murray to a re-building team with an all-star player. In this hypothetical maybe you move Murray to get either John Wall or Kyle Lowry and just hope Lowry OR Wall/Harden/Jokic is enough to get over whatever everyone else puts together in that year.   I think even in all-in situations there are potential outs if something goes awry but still, at the end of the day it's always a decision of if it's worth depleting the stock of draft picks and having a period of 5+ years of being a dumpster fire of a team just to have 1-2 years where you can actually have a real chance of winning."
8-38? Looks like John Wall shooting splits to me.
A decent pick and John wall. John wall is not terrible. Guards in the league are getting better but he’s around hovering his career average production. They got younger and have a top pick. That’s a W.
"I feel bad for him atleast because he was months away from 150M+ and instead gets hurts and loses that opportunity. Meanwhile he has his buddy John Wall sign his max extension THEN get hurt, so atleast he’s sitting fat on his bag that’s fully guaranteed whereas Cousins has to go from team to team trying to carve out a role but keep getting injured.   I could see why Cousins would have difficulty coming to grips with that."
You need more than a year to see John Wall barely has legs? After sitting 2 years?
"In the last two years, his free throw attempts have gone up. Part of this is more ball handling duties and John Wall was the primary prior to this. He should bump up his 3PT attempts (6.3 currently). Notable names above him.. VanVleet (8.9) Mitchell (8.7) Doncic (8.4) Lavine (8.2) .. I believe this is the current sweet spot in the NBA. If he bumps up 2 more per game his scoring average should reflect a higher potential. His game currently is mostly centered in the mid-range and at the bucket."
He was also thrown on John Wall in the first round that year
" John Wall will be back next season, and I’m excited to see him play!"
"John ""Kevin Love"" Wall"
"You’re right. You guys look really good this year, good thing you got rid of him for john wall"
"John Wall: Hey coach, I think I have a slight....   Silas: Sounds critical, better sit out the rest of the season."
John wall
"I think though, when people have every attribute, or most, but don't dunk, they get classified as being like Steve Nah. Westbrook blows them both out of the water, but Kyrie is way more agile laterally than John Wall while also being able to contort his body and play lower than John Wall. Kyrie's not as quick maybe in initial burst, but is still one of the quickest. His open court speed is super close. Wall has him narrowly beat in speed/quickness but it's in the same realm, while Kyrie has him beat in agility and body control and coordination, then Wall has him beat in bounce"
"John ""Ez Money"" Wall"
Bruh John Wall is bouta be sidelined with injuries for like the 4th straight season. What happens to him now? He’s like Gilbert arenas 2.0
John Wall sitting out helps us and I really hate that.
Don't know if you've noticed but John Wall helps to lose games
All star guard John Wall**
"His first playoff series he was the primary defender for John Wall, and in his 2nd series he was the primary defender of Lebron.   He has always been ready for the playoffs defensively, and his offensive game has improved a ton.   Looking forward to see how he continues to improve because his skill set is amazing for any team, and that contract extension is only going to look better as time goes on."
"What? You act like everyone was against the trade, I was happy af. John Wall had two significant injuries and hadn't played in 2 years. Like I said, thanks for Westbrook."
"No, I copy pasted his post below:  Look at past drafts:   2018: Ayton v. SGA 2017: Fultz v. Donovan Mitchell or Bam 2016: Simmons v. Sabonis 2015: KAT v Devin Booker 2014: Wiggins v Jokic 2013: Anthony Bennet v. Giannis 2012: AD v Draymond 2011: Kyrie v Kawhi 2010: John Wall v Paul George  I’d take the 10th pick in 2018, 2017, 2014, 2013, 2011, 2010.   2015 is a wash"
"Look at past drafts:   2018: Ayton v. SGA 2017: Fultz v. Donovan Mitchell or Bam 2016: Simmons v. Sabonis 2015: KAT v Devin Booker 2014: Wiggins v Jokic 2013: Anthony Bennet v.

Goodwin got some john wall speed.
"John Wall does this thing where he doesn't pass to anyone and chucks 3's for like 5 straight possessions. *5th straight miss* ""damn, guess I really don't have it tonight"""
Its like comparing John Wall and Klay. Klay relies a lot more on his shooting and skill while Walls play was much more reliant on athleticism
"John Wall still on this list even after being out for so long and playing 32 and 41 games prior to the injury. Hope he bounces back, he's still 30.   CP3 is insane"
That guy flies under the radar. He's been able to avoid the Westbrook/John Wall/Wiggins treatment for his crazy contract.
"Peak John Wall was an elite playmaker, is the thing. Yeah, his efficiency was never that great, but Monta never gave you anything close to 10 assists. Besides, some of those Wizards teams he led were pretty solid, like 4th/5th seed teams."
This took honest thought to compile. Close contrast in D Lo. I can only think of John Wall. Shoot errthang and play on loosing teams.
"John Wall and Jeremy Lin had the same times coming into the draft.  John Wall was described as ""athletic"", and Jeremy Lin as 'deceptively athletic"".  If basketball ever had a Moneyball movie equivalent, it'd probably involve a rag-tag team that acquired hungry, underrated vets, and Jeremy Lin would definitely star in it."
Prime John wall
John Wall than Mike Miller
Come coach a team with Championship aspirations!  Sike! Here's the corpse of John Wall and Kelly Olynyk
it wasn't necessarily about strength with me about d rob.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKVqpXl3M18&amp;ab\_channel=VideoLonghorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKVqpXl3M18&amp;ab_channel=VideoLonghorn)  &amp;#x200B;  In my above point i really meant insane athletes who also won/proved themselves.  Anyway im sure everyone would agree with zion in terms of strictly athleticism. His explosiveness is insaneeee.  In terms of athleticism stamina is another factor.  Fun fact MJ had insane stamina.  Played his ass off both ends.  Dennis Rodman had BETTER stamina. PJ has said that Dennis was the best pure athlete he's coached at some tpoint.  Rodman would go balls to the wall during a game then go 40 minutes on stairmaster after the game.  John Havlicek used to literally run everywhere to travel when he was a kid-- he ended up with lungs 50% bigger than the average humans.  When he went to the doctors for X-rays Their display screen wasn't big enough to show the size lol.  These guys could play balls to the wall for 48 minutes.  Shaq LEbron zion can't do that.  But of course rodman/havlicek didn't have the same coordination of strength/speed as the other guys.  In terms of for pure basketball effectiveness i would say MJ/Wilt had the absolulte best bodies.
John Wall?
What? No lol that roster is dogshit and john wall isn't the same player anymore
You would expect them to win with john wall
"As a wizards fan, thats a load of bologna and I love John wall. I didn't like the trade at first solely from an emotional fans standpoint, but it made sense basketball and business-wise. Westbrook is a first ballot hall of famer and wall isn't even considered a superstar. At this stage, I'm not sure he'll even reach Allstars level. Westbrook is by far the better player today at their respective ages. After his injuries, wall will never get to his peak level of play"
I mean John Wall is better but 🤷🏾‍♂️
Prime John Wall was something special
I thought for a second that Houston might steal this one. Then I remembered that John Wall plays for them and runs their crunch time offense like has blinders on.

Houston traded him....FOR JOHN WALL LMAOOOO
We still have John Wall
"I disagree.  I think the Uni's look dope, especially in person.  I bought a John Wall one for my buddy that's a Rockets fan and it looks sweet.  I even wore it to test it out and see how it fit/felt for a bit (even though it felt disgusting wearing a Rockets uni).  I dig them."
"I like John Wall but FTR, FTC, FTL, and most importantly FTD"
"I *really* don’t envy the role players on this Nets team. You got Harden who is basically Lou to the rockets’ Will Smith (John wall being the little statue Will bought as a present), and Kyrie “gotta get some players” Irving. Imagine giving up your stats/potential-payday and doing dirty work in games for guys openly look down on anyone who isn’t a top tier superstar"
John Wall also said he wasn't happy with Harden's behavior so it wasn't just Cousins.   Pre-bubble? The Rockets were in the playoffs in the bubble and a lot of people thought they could beat the Lakers with their small-ball so I don't get what you mean when say Harden was already gone pre-bubble.
What was the alternative?  A Ben Simmons + John Wall pairing perma 9th seed?  They're rebuilding.  I guess they could've taken Simmons and flipped for more assets... but we don't know:  in that scenario would there have been interested parties who weren't needing to send back long term contracts?
"Obviously the man isn't faultless. That Chris Paul team was great but I think it's a reach to say they could've won a ring when they already tried and failed. Also there were doubts about how that team played because the entire offense revolved around Harden, and relied heavily on threes.  He then asked for a trade after John Wall and Cousins joined the team because that clearly wasn't going to get him a ring. I don't know why anyone is acting like he should've stayed there and wasted his prime years. After being Houston's best player for years he deserves to get a trade if he wants to. He started bitching because it seemed unlikely anything was going to happen. But then the next day he got traded so turns out his bitching worked."
"everybody in here complaining about the owner cutting corners yet looking at this rockets roster and its not like harden has nobody to play with, this christian wood guy is averaging 20-10 and pair him with john wall in the back court and they could have been an actual formidable team."
Exactly and this is why I don't understand most of the hate towards Harden. The man simply said that he has tried everything in Houston and unfortunately it didn't work out. He didn't point the finger towards anyone. He just wants something new because obviously John Wall and Cousins ain't gonna get him a ring.
"Nah bro, get Christian Wood some help! Trade a couple picks for a veteran guard and big man. Something like this maybe:  John Wall/George Hill/Christian Wood/PJ Tucker/Al Horford  Man that gets y’all in the playoffs for sure!!"
"I AM ALL IN ON THE CHRISTIAN WOOD, JOHN WALL, DEMARCUS COUSINS, STERLING BROWN, JAE'SHAUN TATE ROCKETS  EWING THEORY SZN"
I think John Wall is the leader of the Rockets now? things move fast
"I disagree, he wants and deserves to play with another elite player. Christian Wood and John Wall weren't gonna ever give him inspiration to ball to what he's capable of."
"Honestly where does a team of Wall + Simmons 🤢 and a nearly empty cupboard of assets get you? They’d have to completely retool their roster around Simmons while still having contracts like Eric gordon and John Wall on the books. They wouldn’t be competitive now, and it would be seriously difficult to build around what they do have   Those first round picks and an expiring oladipo are assets that won’t depreciate like a Ben Simmons that still can’t shoot or a LeVert who still hasn’t put it together either."
John Wall trade incoming
"they really shouldn't have had to, morey probably looking at the nets in confusion and probably a bit annoyed  harden was such a liability they told him to stay home and every game he just walked around and passed to john wall and the nets still gave them everything they had, 4 frp and swaps"
"My guess is it was the money. The ownership group did not want to be in the luxury tax for a player that wasn't even gonna play, so they got rid of capela and told their 4 he would have to start working overtime. Then (speculation) they either told their coach they wasn't paying his contract or the contracts of good players and he said goodbye; same goes for the gm; then they trade away a guy that they tried so hard to get because they didnt like his contract (hindsight is 20 20 but at the time it was a salary drop).    Imo, the writing is on the wall in terms of the owners goals: he wants to be competitive enough to stay profitable and he doesn't want to go into the luxury tax. And tbh, I gotta hand it to him because John wall, oladipo, tucker, wood, and boogie are all pretty entertaining players.  Theoretically speaking you can win a chip without going into the luxury, I just dont think that it is likely."
Poor John Wall went all the way to Houston and they won’t even let him wear red...
"In my ideal Basketball HOF, Lowry would just miss the cut.  He's a 6x Eastern All Star (probably would only have 2-4 if he played in the West against Steph, Lillard, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Harden, Kobe, Luka, Tony Parker, Paul George for the AS guard slot), 1x All NBA and 1 title as a #2/3 option. He had a short but semi successful college career and one gold medal, but it's team USA so how impressive is that really. He's a solid player and any team would be lucky to have him, but he isn't a transcendent talent like Duncan, Dirk, Nash, Kobe, Chris Paul etc...  At his peak he still wasn't a top 5 player in his position. Steph, Lillard, Westbrook and Chris Paul were all clearly better than Peak Lowry (2015-2018) and then guys like Kyrie Irving, John Wall, 2017 Isaiah Thomas, James Harden (if you count his 2015-18 stint as a PG) are all in the same tier.  I think to make the HOF you should be absolutely irreplaceable and left a distinct mark in NBA history, and obviously this is just my interpretation, which means nothing. But Lowry as great as he was/is was replaceable."
"When I first got into the nba, my parents wouldn’t let me stay up late enough to watch the western conference games so what made me fall in love with the association was the eastern conference circa 2009-2012  Celtics: Loved Watching Rondo facilitate to Kg, Paul, and Ray Bulls: D Rose was an exciting of a player as I’ve ever seen, plus I loved the way Joakim Noah played  Magic: Prime Dwight Howard killing shit with Hedo, Vince Carter, Jameer Nelson, and Ryan Anderson Heat: LeBron, Wade, Bosh were on another level Pacers: Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, Lance  Sixers: Young Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala  Knicks: Melo and Amari    Even liked watching the not so good teams like the Cavs with Young Kyrie or the Wizards with young John Wall"
Not really.  John Wall and Vic and Christian can make the playoffs
Actually it would be terrible.  John wall and Beal aren’t winning shit in the west
"We don’t know what Morey was really willing to offer at this point.  Simmons is a terrible fit with John wall and we didn’t have enough capital to improve if we got Simmons. Sure our future would have been brighter in the short term, but our ceiling would be the 8 seed."
"John Wall, Bradley Beal, and DeMarcus Cousins sounds nice and actually make sense"
"Let’s analyze this in Tillman terms.  John Wall will possibly get injured again, permitting the Rockets to write off his salary cost and have insurance pay for it.   Olidipo is an expiring contract so he can be traded away for cheap assets or just let walk at the end of the year for more savings.  Cousins costs the team almost nothing.  This is a team that is not planning around on-court performance. It’s planning around reducing salary burden until owning a team becomes profitable on a game-to-game basis again."
\*has john wall and victor oladipo\* calls it a shit year. smh
"He wants to come to Houston to reunite with John Wall, I'm a trustworthy source don't worry.  Deal will be centered around Eric Gordon and Danuel House. Expect it to be announced within the week."
The Wiz really paid a first round pick to lose with Russel Westbrook and nobody instead of John Wall and nobody
Completely agree. He could even spend time at the 4 and run a line up with him and boogie. Christian wood is quick enough to cover the 3. And do Eric Gordon and John Wall
"Russ is coming off seasons of  32/10/10/1.5 (MVP)  25/10/10/2  22/11/11/2  27/8/7/1.5 (Bubble/1st year with Harden)  and so far in Washington, his second new team in two years,  20/10/11/1.5       The 4 years before this hes led his teams to records of 44-28 (72 game season), 49-33, 48-34, 47-35,       Over these 5 years hes shot 30/50/77 with 5 TO. Obviously these could be improved, and people can definitely argue that these make him ""worse"", but its not like they are arguing for John Wall/Kemba/Kyrie type players who have been out often the past couple years. Or older players who should understandable be on the decline like Chris Paul.       Russ has put up absurd numbers year after year including all kinds of accolades like MVP, 2x Ast leader, 2x scoring leader, 9x ALL NBA. Its crazy that people act like Russel Westbrook is an insulting benchmark."
"That's good for them though, once Harden has been traded its not like Houston is going to think about competing this year or next, they are basically going to ""reload"" a bit here.  Finish this season off could maybe make the playoffs (would be better if they didn't though, which is why I do think they will trade Oladipo, PJ Tucker, probably everyone on the table beside Christian Wood (will probably be impossible to move John Wall)).   See where FA and draft go, start rebuilding and finding a new core."
"&gt; They can - there's nothing that says Houston needs to only take expiring money.  Their broke ass owner means they can’t take anything other than expirings. John wall, Christian wood, daneul house, and Eric Gordon alone costs them over 80 mil. They need to sign 10 more players to have a full roster next season. They can’t afford 20 million to Gary Harris.  &gt; He's been a 20 ppg scorer this year so far, even if his defense has fallen off, teams have traded late 1sts for less.  The Celtics don’t even need another guard. You gonna start him over Kemba, brown, or smart in the playoffs? Hell no. Philly trade you mentioned seems somewhat possible. Would be a bad idea for Philly unless they’re  convinced dipo will win them a chip this season, which I’m not."
Simmons can be the second best player and tickets should have taken Simmons and flipped John wall for shooters
"John Wall/Oladipo/Cousins are not a bad core of a ""small"" big three. They can be a solid play off team for years while getting lottery picks from the Nets who will fail."
"Somehow, after years of disliking Boogie and John Wall strictly for their personalities and antics, I am now living in a version of the world in which I have more respect and admiration for Wall and Cousins’ responses to James Hardens antics.   If I could go back to 3 years ago, my goodness"
"Wood is a good piece but he's not complete. He struggles on defense and has to be spoon fed a lot of points. EG and Tucker I feel like are on the decline, especially Tucker. John Wall is a good player but not what he used to be. They could've done better if Harden completely bought in, but realistically, this team would never compete with the top dogs"
"Then they trade john wall, oladipo and cousins. Build around christian wood?"
What does he say at the start about John wall? Audio was a bit unclear
The Rockets are John Wall and Boogie's team now. I really hope they improve their record.
"yeah thats fair. Im not sure any of John Wall, Eric Gordon or Oladipo are on this team next year. Christian Wood is a future staple though, hopefully."
"Right? I said earlier that I could root for the John Wall-Boogie Cousins Rockets, and that was before I heard about Oladipo."
"Luka, Steph, Dame, Booker, CP3, Mitchell are all above him. Then you still got guys like John Wall and Jamal Murray. Ja and Shai knocking on that door too. Don’t think CJ will make it."
"“A proven winner— and big game player— who is durable and has high character.”  - Ted Leonsis, after trading away John Wall. Karma is undefeated, you loser."
"Maybe I'm crazy but I like this Rockets situation and think Oladipo is fortunate to be there. They're really, really, really, really high heart and I want to see them succeed. This is beside the point but when I first started watching NBA games seriously and regularly, Cousins was one of my favorite players in the league (high school class of 2016), we've all forgotten what he looked like as a do-literally-everything-but-guard-defense big man but he was electrifying. As someone who's watched the last decade of Celtics basketball, I know what John Wall is about. I don't wanna look down on these Rockets, they can be awesome."
It is understandable if a FO does not want to build around ben simmons who presents a lot of challenges for roster construction. especially for the rockets when they will have john wall on their roster for three years of ben simmons' contract.
"&gt; what are the chances that pick is better than Simmons?  What are the chances they do anything with a Ben Simmons/John Wall core? Ben doesn't shoot well enough from outside to play the 1/4, and he doesn't have the post moves to play the 5."
"Ben Simmons is awesome, but I don't think he will ever be the best player on a championship team, just like Giannis.   They are terrible free throw shooters. This is a fatal flaw that prevents them from being a lead ball handler &amp; number one offensive threat in the playoffs.  Plus, Ben Simmons and John Wall are a terrible fit. Oladipo is a much better fit, and if they don't like what they see in the next couple of months, they will be able to move him for something.  I wouldn't want to build my team around Simmons. I would love to have him as the second best player on my team, but not the best. No way."
Thybulle has regressed this year. I'd take Oladipo. Simmons next to John Wall feels like a spacing nightmare
Poor John Wall won’t get to play in the ‘nals
"Since Harden barely defense and not an off-ball player, the Nets should get John Wall or D Cousins."
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"I'm not convinced Simmons was offered. All the reports have been ""Rockets looking for package involving Simmons"" or something along those lines. And it just seems like surely you'd take the trade that gives you Simmons over the one that gives you Levert, who cares about picks? The John Wall/Ben Simmons fit isn't great, but you're still getting one of the best young players in the league."
"Two teams that are equally good in different season, or even in different conference (even in different divisions) won't end up necessarily end up with the same record.   Your record and seeding is about who you are competing against.   The Rockets were a 50-win team last year based on their winning percentage.   A team with John Wall, Christian Wood (playing like he's played), Oladipa and a moderately healthy DMC can win 50 games depending on their level of competition.   The fact that they are off to a slow start is demonstrative of Harden's refusal to actually try (look at his percentage and scoring out put over the last five games, which are his lowest in over FIVE years).  Before those five games they were .500 and they even managed to win one of those games.   But last year's Rockets were playing against a weaker Western conference, so that same roster would likely win fewer games this year (Phoenix, LAL, NO, Sac-Town, Denver, and Dallas are all better, while Utah, Portland, and the Clippers are just as good).   It's a 'what if' sure, but the current Rockets roster has as much talent from 1-15 as last year's team, even if last year's team had better talent up at the top."
"Yep, John Wall, Victor Oladipo, and Boogie Cousins insane big 3  It's 2017 right?"
Thank you for that! I agree with John wall Christina woods and dipo I don’t see them being that bad
Poor John Wall
john wall has hit more 3s in the past 3 games than ben simmons has in his whole career so not the best comparison
You must hate John Wall
"Maybe rockets would trade john wall and some picks for him, they have an addiction to pg swaps."
"The Houston Rockets turned James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Covington into Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Christian Wood 7 first round picks and 4 pick swaps"
Does this mean both teams lost the Westbrook &lt;-&gt; John Wall Trade
"Lmao why are you so mad?   John Wall has a contract that will, believe it or not, eventually expire.   The Rockets will be fine"
The Rockets are paying John Wall and Eric Gordon a combined $70 million for the next 3 years. They’re going to be garbage. The Nets at least have proven competent front office. The Rockets are just as likely to be worst than the Nets than vice versa.
"Cap space for what exactly lmao ain’t nobody comin to play with John Wall. Enjoy watching others contend, you had your shot for a few years and y’all blew it."
Rockets looking to be way better off with John Wall and these guys.
Oladipo and John Wall a formidable duo or no? Hmm.
"Yeah this comment makes opposite sense. This rockets front office has absolutely killed it during their 3-months or so tenure. Turned a disgruntled duo in Russ and harden in to John Wall, Dipo and basically 8 first rounders (5 frps + 3 pick swaps). Also added Christian wood for cheap. Jheez"
"But considering they all wanted out definitely not bad, I'm more concerned with how John Wall and Oladipo will get them anywhere past a first round exit"
"On another note if you play fantasy NBA and don't have John Wall, get him ASAP.   Bout to go nuts."
"You mean-   Friendship ended with Russell and KD ended now Chris Paul my best friend   Friendship ended with Chris Paul ended now Russell my best friend   Friendship with Russell ended again, now John Wall my best friend  Friendship ended with John Wall now Kevin Durant my best friend again."
DIPO AND JOHN WALL GOT NEW KNEES LETS GO PLEASE
"john wall is 10x better than westbrook, they got a real center, and they got christian wood but apparently none of that matters at all like what are you smoking"
"Oladipo, Boogie, and John Wall would've been insane in 2018"
I feel so fucking bad for John Wall
"Harden gets traded from OKC, then 7 years later reunites with Russ and KD separately in back to back seasons.  Now all we need is Kyrie getting traded for Russ. Gilbert Arenas and John Wall ain't walking through that door, and neither would Kyrie!"
Can we have John Wall back somehow?
"Dudley, John Wall, Quinn Cook, and Dennis from his OKC days say otherwise. May be a prick as the opposing man but seems like his teammates get along wit him kinda like Boogie"
"The last game against us was honestly pathetic to watch, he didn't give a shit at all. I remember one pass towards an open John Wall where he just tossed it at half court and Wall had to run to get it, then gave Harden a staredown.  It's been a long time since I've seen a player so obviously shit on their team. Even AD didn't do this."
"Well they're 3-6, what did they expect. John Wall has like one good game and starts acting like he's an MVP, bragging that he will score a career high now.   As bad as the Rockets have been, they're probably got to be even worse without Harden. He covered up a bunch of flaws. It's actually not easy finding players that give you 25-5-10."
"Tate, Silas to name a few have said he's been good. Even John Wall yesterday said he has done everything asked of him. My question is - who's word do we take now?"
John Wall :)
I see a reality where they trade for 7 picks from the nets they trade Kyire at the deadline for 3. And John wall for 2. They are going to be the new okc
John wall and Ben Simmons on the same team is interesting
You are crazy to think this.  Boogie is old injuries have killed him. He can’t stay on the court without fouling out.  John wall is a lateral move from Westbrook and Christian wood is still coming into. His own.  Not to mention they have a rookie coach and crappy role players
John wall is a black hole on offense.  They're having the same issues the wizards did
It’s crazy! I hope you guys look great when he leaves. I’m from North Carolina so I’m happy to see John Wall doing well.
"...uh, which is why I said players have said the opposite? Even John Wall said yesterday he has shown up and done what they asked."
They have John wall....why get Kylie?
This should be a no brainier for Philly. Pairing John Wall and Simmons seems like an awful idea
"DeMarcus Cousins: ""My interest is to play with John Wall, to be brutally honest. ...The (Harden) disrespect started way before. This isn't something that, you know, all of a sudden started last night. ...It's completely unfair to the rest of the guys in the locker room.""   ""Other 14 the guys in the locker room have done nothing to him. For us to be on the receiving end of disrespectful comments and antics...it's unfair to the rest of the guys in the locker room.  https://twitter.com/sam_amick/status/1349443469954019328?s=19  https://twitter.com/Rockets_Insider/status/1349443350320066566?s=19"
john wall and AWOL
John Wall  + Cousins vs Harden when he comes back to Houston will be entertaining as hell
Ben Simmons and John Wall on the same team would be something lol
"According to contracts, John Wall is the leader."
John Wall deserves better
"No it wasn't. He was completely transparent with everyone and still showed up.  Coach Silas says Harden gave him a chance and has been nothing but professional to him. He says it’s just a crazy NBA situation.  John Wall said Harden showed up and practiced hard, did what he was asked in games.  It isn't on Harden if people expected him to carry them after openly saying he wanted out."
Coach Silas says Harden gave him a chance and has been nothing but professional to him. He says it’s just a crazy NBA situation.  John Wall says Harden has been super professional and showed up to practice and games and did what he was told to and tried.  Not sure why you think you know better
Kyrie and John Wall makes more sense than Ben Simmons and John Wall
John Wall was about to call the gang if Harden showed up to practice
I just feel bad for John Wall.
"Sorry, but this is just utter nonsense. Paul George is still really good. Some team would take him for positive assets if the Clippers wanted to blow it up. You could very easily trade him for some deal that expires earlier and get back picks. Maybe not the best picks but certainly something especially if you’re taking on a lesser player on big money in return. If their goal is just to blow it up, they could trade George to a team like the Warriors for Wiggins contract.   This idea that the Clippers couldn’t trade an All-NBA level player who has a game that ought to age well, unlike Westbrook or John Wall, is just fantasy. The Clippers being down 2-0 should be enough to be happy about."
"They could definitely flip John Wall for picks the year after, it's a foolproof plan really"
Wait till John wall reads this thread at halftime. Over for u casuals
John wall tbh. A little more nimble though and from what we’ve seen more talent at this point.
"I think it's largely due in part to the amount of money that is at stake.  Larry Bird made 25 mil for the duration of his career.  Let's say he spent none of it, no agents fees, no taxes.  25 mil in 1992 when he retired would be 46 million dollars in 2021 bucks.  A heck of alot of money for the best or 2nd best player of his era.  Paul George made 44 million dollars THIS. SEASON.  John Wall? 42.  It's just soooo much money.  It feels like an entirely different realm of reality to us.  Imagine making Larry Bird's career earnings *every* year for multiple years."
They should get John Wall  please
I mean maybe John Wall gives up some money to chase a title but he’s owed 40+ mil annually so how much can he really leave on the table?
"John Wall might be interested, and he's not going to leave you pick-less till 2028."
I overlooked his inefficiency his rookie year and really thought he could be john wall/drose level but instead of ever improving he just regressed... neither the knicks nor the mavs fault
"Gotta trade Morris, Beverley, and Rondo for John Wall this offseason.  ^(*crosses fingers and prays*)"
"It's always weird when active players make these comments. Last fall John Wall was talking about how the league is too buddy buddy now and ""I ain't got no friends."" Buddy you came in 2010. Your league has never been *hard*."
Lest we forget gang sign John Wall?
"He may demand a trade, but what team is going to pay that 40+m/ year, they at best get a couple seconds round picks, or like a John Wall type player."
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"

"Wall Ball.   The point guard style developed and refined by Houston Rockets legend, John Wall."
"Lmao John wall averaged 19.9ppg and had been all defense the season before and was an allstar (for the 3rd year in a row).  Derrick rose far removed from mvp, 20ppg allstar (for 2nd year in a row) jimmy butler.   Both those teams had better rosters than Detroit.  Idk what you are trying to argue that Van Gundy should have done in Detroit."
Ja Morant is just a more athletic version of John Wall.
"&gt;RJ/KCP/Tobias/Marcus Morris/Andre  I can't believe you threw this out there as a lineup he should have gotten more from. The fact he got this line up to the playoffs is an accomplishment in and of itself. You expect a Detroit team with no 20ppg scorers, no allstars, no notable defenders, and no notable depth to win a playoff seriers? This team made it over      \- a young Wiz with John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter, Markief Morris, and Marcin Gortat   \- the Bulls with Derrick Rose-Jimmy Butler-Taj Gibson-Nikola Mirotic     And that detroit roster only got worse every year.     What is there to defend? The Pelicans best player is 20 and has played 1 season of NBA basketball. Literally. 85 games. Did I say this year was a success? No i didn't say that anywhere. They underperformed, they underperformed by 3-4 wins."
hows john wall
John Wall
"Yes - next year and the following. They also have John Wall and Eric Gordon making almost $70 mil a year combined for the next 2 years. Next year (and maybe the following) are the years to tank, especially if they lose their pick this year to the Thunder. Then starting in '24, they owe protected picks to the Thunder"
"Bro are you serious? Anthony Bennett, landry feild's, dwill. John wall in this season alone? You're honestly being stupid as hell right now. There are countless players that are bigger and smaller names that trade dropped faster than herro, even barring injuries"
They might win with John Wall
"Except his style isn't all that similar to Harden's, he was closer to a Derrick Rose or John Wall with a better 3 ball."
john wall gets bodied by a bathtub
"Lillard range and late game clutch, with John Wall speed."
"1. John Wall sizes up a defender  2. John Wall fails to blow by them  3. John Wall bricks a contested mid range  Great for the tank, horrible to watch as a basketball fan."
Is John Wall still like that? Trying to stay in front of him used to be impossible
john wall
"He wont go very far if he doesnt develop his shot, him developing a shot or not is the difference maker between being like John Wall to  athletic CP3."
"If he improves his shot, he could be an MVP caliber player similar to Westbrook or AI. More realistically, he could be John wall or, if his shot regresses, Rondo"
"Perhaps we need to stop rewarding incompetent franchises with future star players?  Look at Houston's season as the worst team in the league this year shedding every major contract they could not named John Wall. With the #1 draft pick tournament, Houston has to try to stay competitive all year instead of just blowing it up, which is better for the fans and the league overall.  If your franchise consistently cannot get it's shit together to net a top 5 pick in the tournament, then you need to sell the team or overhaul your front office, not rely on charity from the league."
westbrook has been better than john wall this season so idk what you’re trying to say lmao
Imagine trading john wall for westbrook lmfao
Big facts! I was a Russ denier for a long time but he finally sold me this year. Maybe I was just salty but the dude really does give you everything he has. No way John Wall could’ve gotten that out of this squad.
"Klay doesn’t need to be a star. Two lotto picks, a healthy improved Wiseman, AND Klay even if he’s only at 60% is a legit team. Not a 1 seed but can without a doubt be a 3-4 seed if things go well. Klay isn’t out here like John Wall where he relied on athleticism to be good. He can hobble around and still absolutely knock down 3’s"
Giannis needs to play more like Hakeem and less like John Wall
"Yes athleticism is part of his game, I believe a better phrase is explosiveness. John Wall relied on explosiveness which gets absolutely murdered when you have any type of tear. Klay has never relied on his explosiveness on the offensive side of his game."
"All things considered John Wall is still pretty solid. Warriors fans need to hope he don't come back like how Boogie did, because they essentially had similar injury routes with both having expereinced 2 major injuries consecutively.   I'm sure Klay will still have the ability to shoot the lights out but the biggest question will be his defense."
Running around screens and accelerating past tje guard like John Wall are two very different things
"Cappp, the only part I can see taking a hit is his defense. But offensively I can see him coming back strong. Klay doesn't rely on his athleticism nearly as much as John Wall did. Regardless Klay will see his usual open looks next year and you know his shot will still be there."
I think he's on peak John Wall fan level trajectory more likely but hopefully i'm proven wrong and he's even better.
No. First of all we don’t know how Klay’s gonna look. Could be like John Wall or KD. Might take him a year or so like Gordon Hayward and Paul George. So no.
I'm still getting used to John Wall.
"I think John wall missed as much, getting 20ppg rn but oof efficiency"
He’s not a positive to change culture on a team. He basically burned his bridges on the way out of DC. Demanded more touches and started to ball hog. Started to cuss out brooks  https://basketballsocietyonline.com/report-wizards-john-wall-and-kelly-oubre-cursed-at-head-coach-scott-brooks  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/10/30/18039814/washington-wizards-drama-john-wall-bradley-beal-history  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/27/wizards-are-starting-their-annual-meltdown-early-this-season/
"There are a lot of bad contracts that could use an amnesty: Kevin Love, John Wall, Al Horford, Steven Adams just to name a few"
Ben had better combine times than John Wall and Russel Westbrook
Houston's looks exactly the same except that we're terrible at it now. And those fucking John Wall long 2s.
"""We will not lose more than 25 games in a row"" said Rockets point guard John Wall after a loss, in the midst of a pandemic. The Rockets went on to lose only 20 in a row, Wall delivered."
"I straight up never cared for basketball until I got nba 2K15. That game was fun af and learned the game a lot so I started watching local wizards games back when they had John Wall, catch and shoot specialist Beal and Nene and Gortat. Immediately got hooked. Funny enough MLB the show 21 got me watching a bit of baseball here and there."
"they didn't buy out john wall though, or CP3.  cause if the wizards did that they would have to pay him 90 million dollars over the next 2 seasons  it's different from drummond who was on the last year of his deal.   kevins deal is multiple years for a lot of money, the cavs would be on the hook for all of it if they buy him out.   drummond is already off the cavaliers books, they are totally done with their obligations to him  maybe houston can take kevin love too if the cavaliers will pay them a bunch of draft picks.   because they plan to be bad for the duration of john walls contract.  they might buy out his deal in the last year too because they will have absorbed all the damage from that bad contract already by that point"
"Everything you’re saying about KLove was said about CP3 prior to being traded to OKC. Word for word. In fact, CP3’s situation was worst than KLove.   As for the John Wall trade…it doesn’t matter if it was awful for both parties, the trade happened."
"CP3 is clearly a very valuable asset and it's not hard to argue that he's worth his contract, he's been mentioned in MVP conversations this season  That john wall trade was awful for houston IMO, westbrook is so much more valuable than him.   It's not john's fault though he is legitimately a good player when he is healthy  Unlike kevin love who gives you no value, he's never gonna get another 100 million dollar contract, would you give up 30 or 60 million dollars to go ring chase when you know you aren't going to get a payday like that ever again  So maybe kevin love has value to a tanking team?  You have to plan to suck for a long time and cleveland would have to pay you to take him.  And I don't think kevin would be very happy there either  He might get bought out in the last year of his deal then he can go ring chase and he still gets his money"
"Certainly there's Asian bias, I'll even provide you with some examples:  * [1st team all state (California) alongside Ryan Anderson, James Harden and Chase Budinger; co-MVP with Kevin Durant of McDonald's All American game](https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/california/post/_/id/631/jeremy-lin-and-the-2006-all-state-team).

While we can argue that he's not in the NBA currently due to age or injuries, I wonder if perhaps things would be different had he gone to an actual top 16 college; or been drafted where the scouting metrics had him; or been acknowledged for his physical attributes.  Your 50 downvotes are certainly due to fans of Lin who are biased in their opinion, but the greater bias lies elsewhere."
"Yea…you haven’t been paying attention to the trades these last few years. This was the exact same thing people have said about CP3, John Wall and so many others that have been traded."
Is this a good way for a team to get rid of a bad contract like John Wall or Kevin Love?
Is this the real John Wall? What?
16-17 John Wall and Beal carried em

Still John Wall
"Give me John Wall, Dion Waters, Tony Snell, Joakim Noah, and Kevin Love"
Colin Cowherd can go fuck himself.   From his John Wall take to his Baker Mayfield take dude is just a grade a asshole.
"I'll never forgive cowherd the way he went after John Wall for no fucking reason. Just criticized him for dancing the dougie, called him undisciplined, gangster, not a leader.   It was always sprinkled with a little hate. That dude is a bitch"
John Wall.  He at least almost made the ECF with Beal and scrubs.
You completely missed the point. The team giving away the bad contract doesn't need to take one back that's equally bad.   Let's say the Rockets want to trade John Wall if the Cavs have enough cap space for his salary they can just send a vet minimum contract to the Rockets.
I think a healthy John Wall sells enough jerseys and tickets in 3 years to make it worthwhile. Health is the big question there.   Also need to pick up vets who don't take away from development of young guys. If Chris Paul declines physically a lot in the next two years and still has a large contract a team might not protect him and he could be a huge asset to a young team.
Would they be interested in a John Wall?
"Yeah, if they were to hypothetically do it this offseason, I'm pretty sure the Kings wouldn't protect Buddy Hield. I wonder if someone like John Wall would be protected. Even though the contracts aren't great, the longest contracts are 5 years now, so if they manage to get someone 3 years in, maybe the expiring contract can be a tradeable asset to make it worthwhile.  The only worry would be new owners maybe not wanting to pay that much for those guys without competing and right after paying massive expansion fees."
"&gt;Jeremy Lin was an athletic freak  I remember hearing that when analyzed on camera he had the fastest first two steps of any player in college his senior season, even faster than John Wall."
Or John Wall
"is it public knowledge which players get protected? like if the rockets happen to not protect john wall to save money, would john wall know about it?"
Of course Houston would shed Wall for nothing if they could. And of course a new team would not want John Wall smiling at the podium after they just got their ass kicked making 45 million.
"Yep. I used to say this about John Wall too. Forget the fact that he can't shoot at all, he doesn't have a floater either. Same for Westbrook"
"I mean, they gotta at least pretend to field a professional NBA team lol they’ll do plenty of losing with John Wall at the helm, a la 2021 Houston Rockets"
They should go after John Wall
"im anti trade kemba (makes no sense to move him for a worse contract or give up picks) , but in the case of an expansion draft this summer (i doubt it would happen this year anyway), i think it would be smart to see if some team grabs him since it would open up our cap flexibility with the Jays earlier (summer of 23 probably). expansion team more likely to take kemba than john wall or kevin love too"
"- I think there's a chance Dennis Schroder doesn't re-sign and the Lakers get a buyout John Wall. And I think it will work out for them, he has a lot left in the tank, just can't lead a bad team.  - The Warriors seriously shop Wiseman, Minnesota pick (whatever it becomes), and Wiggins together.   - Everyone in Portland will be on the block, but they will keep Dame and CJ   - if the Clippers don't make the conference finals, they will shop PG."
"""Don’t come to my city, wearing all black, talking about a funeral"" - john wall 2017"
John wall died for this
Just to make first team all defense. https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/washington-wizards/kobe-bryant-issues-challenge-john-wall-make-first-team-all-defense
"They were better with John Wall. And that isn't saying much because he has not only given up on even trying anymore on the court, but has also stopped caring off the court (appearance, throwing up gang signs, taking peds and drinking alcohol)."
I remember Kobe challenged John Wall to become the DPOY too
IIRC John Wall asked for a challenge and Kobe said All Defense team.
I would take either over John Wall
"Agreed, Trae is definitely better than John Wall"
"&gt;The first third of the season Edwards was the worst player in the NBA  No, that was Russell Westbrook. Then the rest of the year it was John Wall."
What did John Wall do this month
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1. Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Brandon Ingram - 24  **Most games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. James Harden - 16 2. Malik Beasley - 15 3.

Andre Drummond, Khris Middleton - 8  **Fewest games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. Rui Hachimura - 3 2. Carmelo Anthony, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Orlando Magic - 4"
"We have literally not had an athletic rim running center since javale McGee in 2010. This team was begging for one during the entire John Wall era and Ernie couldn’t get it done, because he’s the worst GM in professional sports in the century."
"John Wall is younger than Curry too, and even younger than Klay"
"Bone spurs in combination with an achilles rupture is the worst combo possible. Realistically there was never going to be ""one more run"" with John Wall."
"John Wall and Klay have completely different games. Klay might not have the pre injury off ball movement and defense, but he will always be a threat from deep."
Next year we’ll see when Klay comes back like John Wall; they’re likely not even gonna be Top 4 seed
John Wall isn't a player you can plug into any system and expect it to work.  He's a ball dominant point guard who can't shoot. You can't just compare him to another team's current point guard and see who's better and say he'll start over him.  A player like him needs to be the focal point of the offense and it won't work well with most of the teams you think he'd start for without question.
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
Allen is a center. Rockets just signed wood and view him as a center. Knew they couldn't resign Allen. Swing for a dipo return And missed. LeVert is an above average scorer who doesn't fit with John wall on paper.
Eric Gordon is a very appealing trade piece but nobody is trading for that John Wall Contract.
Nobody clowns Tony Allen tearing his ACL because he tried to dunk on a dead ball.  Nobody clowns John Wall rupturing his Achilles while showering  Nobody clowns Andrew Bynun injuring hi knee while Bowling  Nobody clowns LeBron and Amar'e injuring their hands by punching a white board and a fire extinguisher respectively.  Why would CP3 be clowned for this? Or you?
"Yeah, LeBron stands out pretty heavily in this one.   But definitely can't discount the likes of Giannis, Westbrook, John Wall.   There was always those lighting quick guards who could get out and run as well, Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash and even Leandro Barbosa used to cause their fair share of damage.   There's always the dagger three type of guys as well, who could dribbling out in space, pull up from deep and kill you that way like Curry, Lillard or even Reggie Miller would occasionally hit that fast break triple.   Probably not really the question but the elite passing bigmen who can hit those amazing outlet passes would also be an interesting answer to this question, Kevin Love and Nikola Jokic specifically."
"No, his shot doesn’t work for full time SF, however the Raptors did have success with a Lowry/Kawhi/Siakam/Ibaka/Gasol lineup by that was with 2 40% 3 point shooter bigs  Defensively Siakam has guarded John Wall"
John Wall at a smooth $41 million next season is pretty damn incredible 😉
Wasn't that John Wall
john wall slip in the shower achilles tear
John Wall  LeVert  Drummond   Oladipo  Westbrook  Whiteside
John Wall 😤
Just like people gave up on Randle before he got to the knicks. This sub would trade Simmons for John Wall and a second round pick and wouldn't trade Cam Payne for Jaylen Brown. It's ridiculous.
I made a comment earlier but if Dame left the org would slowly topple. This scenario lets them still set themselves up for a potential to be a contender again within 2-3 years and start shipping players under that prerogative. If Dame forces his way out that becomes 100x more difficult. Plus there's not a great market for contending PG's besides Chris Paul or maybe John Wall available but no way he goes to Portland.
"This all depends on how highly you classify the #1 pick. Wiggins is probably the worst acceptable pick but IMO I don’t expect more out of a #1 pick than Wiggins  John Wall or Ben Simmons are my takes. And yes, they’re both good players, that’s just how high I hold the #1 pick"
And Fox is John Wall-lite who'll be wasting a max contract on the Kangz
So how come there was so much backlash when james harden forced his way out. People really thought a mummified john wall and boogie cousins on half a leg was enough to compete?
"Conley and Clarkson are great players, and the fact that the Jazz would have the same problem the Sixers did makes this trade worse. Both Gobert and Simmons need to be in the paint. Both Embiid and Simmons need to be in the paint. It would be the same bad fit, except Gobert isn’t nearly as good as Embiid. Bad trade.  John Wall can’t shoot. He wouldn’t be a good fit in Philly. Not to mention he’s making supermax money. Bad trade."
"For comparison, here's the list of key players who missed  games in the 2015 playoffs due to injury. (I chose this year at random, but it may have been an outlier as well)  *Stars/Borderline Stars*  * John Wall * Pau Gasol * Kevin Love * Kyrie Irving * Rojon Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul * Mike Conley  *Key Role Players:*  * Andrew Bogut * Tony Allen * Kyle Korver * JR Smith"
But John Wall had nothing to do with the Harden trade...?
"Nah, if the Knicks didn’t make the trade the Nets were going to instead.   Only reason the Nets traded for D.Will was because Melo fell through before their move to Brooklyn. Once the Nets went 12-70 missed out on John Wall and got the #3 pick (Derrick Favors) they realized they needed a “Star” player for their move to Brooklyn.   Nets had to deal with the “Melo-Drama” and then the “Dwight-Mare” shortly after when Howard was forcing his way to Brooklyn only to back out at the last second because he felt bad on the team plane surrounded by everyone.    “Dwight-Mare” led to the Nets in a panic sending an unprotected 1st in a shortened season to Portland to show D.Will they were willing to invest in the roster. That led to Portland drafting Lillard w/ the Nets pick.   Worst part of the whole D.Will era is the Nets were almost free from it in back in 2012.    D.Will was hesitant to sign his 5y/$98m extension and wanted to go home and play in Dallas all while training and rehabbing using the Brooklyn facilities.   Nets lined up Goran Dragic and were ready to cut their losses and move on. Dragic was amped to be on the Nets because Drazen Petrovic was a childhood hero of his. All of a sudden D.Will is given a ultimatum of either sign or leave the facilities and the Nets continue down a dark path. Dragic signs in Phoenix and gets traded to Miami later on.   What could have been in Brooklyn landed Melo and Howard instead or even Howard to pair with D.Will because you have to remember this was still while Howard was in his insane prime before the back injury in LA."
I have no idea how he is still on TV after saying John wall can't be a leader because he didn't have a dad.
Your team turned Harden and Westbrook into John Wall and Kelly Olynyk so idk why u think u can say anything about the knicks. Huerter had 27 in game 7 when Trae was brick chucking
"John Wall, signed max deal just to miss 2 years right after"
"Cowherd is fantastic at turning 15 minutes of content into 4 hours of discussion, almost exclusively done independently. It's a real skill, and he's the best at it.   But he also says intentionally inflammatory and over the line shit. His comments about how hard can baseball be if it can be understood by Dominicans, his comments about John Wall and his lack of a father figure, the general comments he makes about black men vs the ones he makes about white men in leadership positions. There's a lot of stuff that Cowherd gets away with because he gets listeners/viewers, and it's not shit that's okay to say."
I remember Sam took John Wall to a Clippers game so he could study Chris Paul
"&gt;You're over rating Russell. That one Brooklyn season was an anomaly. The guy's a fraud.  His last 2 seasons after leaving Brooklyn have been injury plagued, how can you say hes a fraud when hes barely been healthy since leaving? When Dlo has played with a fully healthy team hes played great.  I think he is a good centerpiece for a swap, it can be like the John Wall and Westbrook trade."
"I think you’re missing the bigger picture. The Rockets want to win a championship, not be a 9th/10th place team every year. Their GM has publicly stated that.   In order to do that you need Superstar talent, and the best way to do that is via the draft or trading. If they traded for Ben, they would ultimately also give up their 2nd pick this year.   So there are two scenarios: the Rockets trade for Ben Simmons and try and compete (remember they have John Wall 40MM/year on the books for the next 2 years) and probably bottom out at 10th/11th seed or they go all in on the tank.   If your argument is “then why not trade Ben for more picks”, isn’t that what they ultimately got with BKN? If you’re trading for unprotected picks your hope is they are going to implode, and the Nets have the most chance. Any team that has Ben for the next 4 years is bound to be in contention for the playoffs.   So at the end of the day, the Rockets are swinging for the fences."
Wes Unseld / John Wall
John Wall and a 1st for SGA?? (ignore my flair)
Make it a three way and bring in John Wall too
&gt;Yeah I'm just sick of people comparing them and having to shit on the other instead of just propping up the 2 best young PGs in the league  Then why did you bring up John wall when talking about Trae..? Be the change you want to see lol
Of course they can - just like the Wiz managed to trade John Wall.
"On 42/33 shooting splits from the field, though. That type of effective field goal percentage is like regular season 2021 John Wall, which is uh, not great."
"Kemba for John wall and a pick, kemba and a pick for Tobias Harris, kemba for Ben Simmons, kemba for porzingis and a pick. Reasons, -houston just want to save money this would be substantial before they transition out of tanking - Philly could either trade Tobias or Simmons depending on whether they believe Simmons can ever gain a jump shot and some killer instinct - Dallas could use kemba as a lower usage sidekick to remove some pressure off of doncic. None of these will happen this summer in my opinion but there aren't really better options for OKC at the moment. They'll likely keep him for a season before flipping his expiring contract for another rehabilitation project."
"Ik everyone forgot about them but we still have John Wall and Eric Gordon  On top of that Wood, KPJ, Tate, and the 2nd overall and idk if we're bottom 3. The only reason we were at the bottom is because of injuries and the Wolves stopped tanking"
Then you have seen him before his ACL and meniscus tears. Maybe watch how he plays nowadays before you talk anything about him. Injuries fucked him up a lot.  Is Cousins also still top player in the league? Or maybe Oladipo or John Wall?

wolves are ok but the John wall rockets are the real deal.
"LOL the fact that you think the Raptors fell apart is funny, fckin nephew. Sorry your team is trash and couldn't capitalize with a literal MVP. Have fun with the corpse of John Wall."
"This is the new “Kyrie or John Wall” barber shop type debate among fans  At this point, maybe we can just all cede that this was a win-win"
are you seriously trying to say the sixers trade for John Wall?
"Uh. Curry got taken to school by Heurter because he is absolutely trash on defense. He’s a horrible defender.   I swear this sub things points = value.  Simmons is absolutely worth a max deal in the reality of what a max deal means.   Sure there are guys potentially better than him making marginally less, but other max (or near max) guys are:  * Steven Adams * Al Horford * Porzingis * Russell * Wiggins * Harris * Conley * John Wall  If you replace anyone of those guys with Simmons are the 6ers better? I would say file that under “hell no”."
"John Wall will definitely be starting for the Rockets opening night, unfortunately lol.  HOU views KPJ as the future PG tho.  Obviously had they landed the #1 pick they'd have taken Cade and reversed course a bit, but I don't see them moving KPJ to SG to make room for Suggs at PG."
ok but that wasn't the intention after the trade. they tried to get john wall to play through injuries in order to win games. christian wood got hurt. eric gordon got hurt. they lucked their way into being extreme trash rather than just regular trash.  let's not do revisionist history here.
oh wow! too bad most of them aren't your own. and ya'll are gonna suck.  enjoy john wall.
"I still don't know why Houston don't takes Suggs.  Getting a lead guard is the most important thing in the NBA outside of a shot creating wing.  Wood can be the Center, Suggs can be the guy that put Wall permanently on the bench.  If John Wall starts for the Rockets opening night that's a problem."
John Wall
John Wall  Eric Gordon  Kevin Love  CJ McCollum
"John Wall, Klay Thompson, Tobias Harris, Kristaps"
"He does have range from penny , but he does have a micheal Beasley build, which isn’t bad he just hasn’t been able to stay on a Team , John wall and Beasley where just going at it in a pick up game."
"I mean, you did go 17-55, it's not like your current starters are irreplaceable. KPJ played what, 25 games? He looked awesome but that's hardly enough of a sample size to pass on a PG when your only other option is John Wall (especially given KPJ's off-the-court issues). KPJ can also absolutely play alongside Suggs.   Also, as much as I like Wood, he's not worth passing on the #2 player in the draft for."
"His best season was the 2015-2016 season let me tell you who the guards were for that year Lowry, D-Wade, and John Wall. He damn sure wasn’t having a better season then anybody I just named"
I don't think John Wall would impede the Rockets from selecting Suggs if they want him.
 &gt; It would also be surprising for the Rockets or Cavs to select Suggs considering they already have solid point guards in their line-up in John Wall and Colin Sexton.   If I'm the Rockets I'd take Suggs. I don't think Wall is in the long term plans. And landing good young Point Guards is hard. I'm a Knicks fan I know that first handed. Out last good starting caliber pg that we drafted was Mark Jackson
He is kinda young John wall to me

Oh shut up man. All you Houston fans were scared to death that you're pick would've been ours. Have fun being irrelevant for the next 5 years with that John Wall Contract.
John wall and the second pick for the first cmon guys just take it who cares
"Hey man, you've got your fair share of franchise legends too!  Guys like Carmelo Anthony and John Wall come to mind"
"Don’t think you can point to one of the most remarkable recoveries ever as an example of the norm. See: Boogie, John Wall, Rodney Hood, etc."
This logic goes both ways in 3 years if Ben is fools gold you can move him again because he’d only have a year remaining on his contract. No contract is untradeable the Wizards got out of John Wall with Achilles surgery.  You open cap space to position yourself for this type of player to be available with little asset cost to your team.
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
How did he bail on being the no 1 option on a contender? Christian Wood and John Wall is not a contending team he was right to leave.
"I see what you are getting at, but to include D rose and Anthony Bennett in there is pretty disingenuous. Rose came to the wolves when he was nowhere near his MVP form, and Bennett was pretty much just a toss in after it was pretty clear he wasn’t any good. It was pretty clear those two weren’t really gonna help them team   KAT and Ant were drafted by wolves and Wiggins  was traded to them right after the draft so those make sense.  But including rose and Bennett would be  like saying the rockets already have former #1 overall pick John wall like the guy clearly was thought of much differently when he joined the team"
Rockets. John Wall can add a hint of mentoring
"LOL @ Trae's ceiling being John Wall, Kyle Lowry.   Trae is a 30/10 player at 22, neither of them have come close to that. Also as of now his playoff assist per game would be good enough for #2 **all time**."
"Luka is miles better than Trae. He gets swept by Clippers  Luka is generation/GOAT ceiling. Trae is good. Thats all. Like in that John Wall, Kyle Lowry tier"
There is no chance the Sixers are trading John wall for Simmons lol
People were actually trying to say Ben simmons is headed to china   As if he doesnt have trade value.   Yall mfers saw Al Horford get traded 3 times and John Wall once and still think some players are untraceable.
"Philly needs a player to help them contend though. The teams in full rebuild mode have very few of those guys.   Thunder have SGA, who is probably straight up better than Simmons at this point, so I can't imagine they trade him. Other than that, it's basically Kemba and his degenerative knees, a million draft picks, and a G league squad.   Rockets have washed John Wall on one of the league's worst contracts, Eric Gordon, and Christian Wood. No deal there.   Magic could do like, Gary Harris, Terrance Ross, and picks? I don't think Philly is taking Fultz back, and it doesn't make sense to move Isaac. No deal there.  Detroit could offer Grant, Cory Joseph, and picks.  Don't think they would offer a top 5 pick. Don't see a deal there, either."
"2010’s  PG - John Wall  SG - Jimmy Butler  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Giannis  C - Brook Lopez  Bench: Jamal Crawford, Joe Johnson, Joakim Noah"
Honestly think John Wall makes the most sense. A lot of people will disagree with me but he makes that team better. Plus Simmons goes to a low pressure situation. It's pretty clear Wall and the rockets don't wanna be with each other.  Obviously Wall is past his prime but he's still good. He's as good as a passer as Simmons and always has shown up in the playoffs on both sides of the ball. And he's not a good shooter either but he can make a fucking free throw.  I could see DLo or Lowry but I think those teams are less likely to make that trade
"yes!!! i, the bumbling basement dweller, with such zany idiotic takes such as “kyrie actually requested a trade to other teams” (which is 100% true and had multiple sources)  as opposed to you, le calm and composed contrarian, with crafty arguments such as: “kyrie ALWAYS wanted the celtics bro, TRUST ME, i have anonymous sources”; “[i hope the nets stay injured](https://i.imgur.com/nzgxUaH.jpg)”; and a slew of insults as soon as you lose yet another argument and are proven wrong  keep crying at home and celebrating other teams getting injured. it’s only fitting since the celtics will continue being a max player rehab center. first it was IT, then Kyrie, then Horford, then Hayward, then Kemba.... looks like Horford really enjoyed his stay there, he’s back with you! who’s next? Kevin Love? John Wall? Porzingis? i’m sure Brad Stevens has some tricks up his sleeve!"
I’d rather have Ben Simmons than John Wall brotha
"This dude knows jack shit about basketball. Just argued with him earlier, he thinks Atlanta plays small ball with Capela   Ben on the Rockets WOULD NOT work well. He only works well with Wood and Eric Gordon, literally not with any other player on the roster. And we don’t exactly have the resources to overhaul the entire roster right now  If they want John Wall, I’m down cause get me away from that contract. But unless they’re taking Wall, without us giving any of the assets we do have, I guarantee the rockets will not be trying for Ben"
If we land Cade Cunningham tomorrow then why not trade Simmons for John Wall? It’s clear that Sixers need an actual point guard.   Christian Wood as your stretch center. Ben Simmons as your point forward. JaSean Tate as small forward. Cade Cunningham and Kevin Porter Jr as your guards. Young team. Simmons gets a clean slate and can get help from John Lucas. Stephen Silas can start with a younger core and hopefully develop the team into a real contender.
Imagine we get Cade and then some trade that lands us Simmons (like John wall)   Stretch Center Wood Point forward Simmons Small Forward Tate Guard Cunningham  Guard KPJ  Tell me that is not a scary fucking lineup.
John wall?
"Ja Morant average shot distance : 10.1 ft  John Wall : 12 ft  De’Aaron Fox : 11.5 ft  Ben Simmons : 4.4 ft  Also from a free throw perspective, all 3 of these guys are  70-75% from the line for their career, Simmons is at 60%. The guys you have here are on a whole nother level as shooters than Simmons imo"
"A lot of good players can’t shoot. Shooting is very important, but if you can’t, you can also get away by producing offense in other ways. De’Aaron Fox, pre-injury John Wall, Ja Morant, and Russell Westbrook are examples of great shot creators who aren’t high efficiency shooters. Ben Simmons’s problem is he doesn’t have half the confidence and aggression those guys do, so he’s mostly standing around the court doing nothing"
"Yeah, if he wasn't going to Tokyo, he'd be organising some games with other NBA players like he did last season when he played a bunch with John Wall, Christian Wood, and other players (which no one seems to mention when they say he didn't try to stay fit at all during last off-season). With this, he get team USA staff to work with and many of the very best to play with during practices."
And then there’s John Wall
John wall to the list
"Yep. Blake Griffin was an extremely rare outlier, you don't normally see guys bought out with multiple years left on their contracts. If John Wall is gonna be a buyout candidate, it'll be in 2022-23 when he's on the final year of his deal, and only if Houston can't find any way to trade him."
I think they could either get assets or not lose any if they trade him for say John Wall or McCollum
"I’m not knocking John wall, I’m showing how using all-nba nominations is a poor way to judge the current ability of players. Don’t be a smooth brain with no goddamn reading comprehension."
John Wall was freakishly good before injuries derailed him. don't be a casual.
Best I can do is John Wall.
I think so.   In between his two injuries he was playing the most efficient basketball of his career.   The knee is something that will keep flaring up but with time and proper management he can still probably carve out a role for himself.   He'll just have to limit his games and minutes and hope he's healthy around playoff time.  His knee is degrading but it won't be an overnight thing. He'll keep getting it lubed up and rehabbing it and he should be able to play on it in some capacity.   I don't think he's at a John Wall / Isaiah Thomas level just yet.
Buyouts aren't always for full contract price.  If John wants to play for a winning team he might cut him a discount.   If I'm John wall I'm Collecting my 40 mill this year though lol
"I was thinking Gobert and John Wall in terms of massive, horrible contracts."
John wall never been to a conference finals. Trae has.
"This is a bad take, and I don't think teams really have low value for him. However, if teams think they can get him for the low, they will.  I don't see the Sixers giving him up for such a little amount.  Picks and a player will be needed.  I'd still rather have Simmons than John Wall."
"Yea, I mean John wall was pretty freaking good, and I don’t think it would surprise anyone if Trae surpasses him in all-nba selections eventually so idk if that’s the best player to use for your argument"
John wall got more all-nba’s than trae too
We've got a slightly used John Wall they can have. Straight up. They won't even have to attach a pick.
How is Anthony Davis not a closer? He is 14/29 on shots to take the lead or tie with less than 24 seconds left. On no planet is John Wall or Gordon Hayward better options over him? [Source](https://twitter.com/tomhaberstroh/status/1307868722938474496?s=21)
Ben Simmons for John wall. Who says no
"The Nets are gonna be a top tier team just as long as Philly, plus Brooklyn already had two all stars compared to swapping all stars with Philly   If you think Simmons is so bad offensively he’s not gonna stop the tank much. He’d be a slightly better John wall offensively for you"
"I watched the games lol Ben's defense on Trae had an impact on the floor and over the course of the year I think being 2nd in the DPOY race brings more value than old ass John Wall.  He had two major injuries, shot 40% from the field, 32% from deep and makes 12 million more than Ben with a 47 million dollar player option lmao. I'll have Ben play defense all year and sit all playoffs before paying John Wall 47 million"
Other guys hve came back from it ok in other sports. John wall is a lot worse than when we last saw him but he likely would’ve declined a lot regardless into his 30s. Klay is a very different player who like durant can still be effective shooting and doesn’t rely on athleticism as much.
"He was played in the 4th Q of all our playoff games lol. You don't have to tell me about his struggles but at least get it right.  John Wall is bad, and no shooting 32% on 6 threes a game does not do more for our team than the DPOY runner up. Ben is still a much better player, idk how this is even an argument. Nobody wants to trade Ben for John Wall"
"Not particularly similar in their playstyles, but for a while I compared prime John Wall to Kyrie, trying to figure out who the best point guard in the East was. Like 2014-2017 - both players were dominant at the same time, and Steph was the best in the west, of course, so it was fun to think about. Wall could never shoot as efficiently as Kyrie, but his game was much more complete, and he of course never had a LeBron to draw attention away from him. Felt like he didn't get enough love for how good he was. Great passer, excellent perimeter defender, and had some great playoff series. I wish he hadn't gotten hurt so significantly. He was so much fun to watch and had some [insane athletic finishes](https://youtu.be/JtSvlgvBBhA?t=129)."
"If you want to rip it down and rebuild then you want cheap younger players on more manageable contracts.  Ben is 25 on a max that’s asking for a retool more than a rebuild and teams who have made offers for Ben are trying to retool.  Even Houston who may want Simmons now won’t offer up their main core guys and star in Green but might have some incentive for a pick or two with John Wall who they don’t want anyway.  The higher offers were Malcom, CJ and Buddy/Bagley types but his value at his lowest to highest still won’t get you a franchise player"
"Doesn’t have to be John Wall but the Dame, Beal or Fox window should of been closed for something way more realistic"
Holding onto Ben instead of trading him for John Wall does not make our situation worse.
"You’re acting like this team desperately needs John Wall or we’re going to crash and burn. Ben’s value can’t go much lower, so I don’t see why it hurts to be a little more patient."
"Ben Simmons is such a fucking baby.  He's nailing his own reputation-coffin with this one.       Morey is probably so pissed.  If he doesn't resolve the Simmons thing then the season is at risk meaning Embiid is going to be pissed at Morey, too.  Fragile set of dominos.  This is why the John Wall to PHI idea isn't so farfetched if you ask me..."
Well John Wall and Malik Beasley certainly won’t be what gets us out of the 2nd round so I’m still content with waiting.
I want John Wall to bust into Sixers training camp like the Kool-Aid man
"I'd honestly prefer if they just had a wall that they occasionally cut to. 0 takes is better than Perkins' takes.  Call it ""Juan Wall"", play off John Wall and it's just one wall."
Didnt realize john wall was with klutch sports
&gt; john wall is nowhere near thr level of simmons on offense  Get out
You tried to write real criticisms of the team when the only thing you need to know is that they sat John Wall before the season started.  Of course they're going to try to get a top pick while they still have them.
"I think given the alternative is John Wall, yes Ben’s defense is more valuable on the court lol. John doesn’t fit at all with Embiid and making a few jumpers doesn’t change that. Our team is much much better with Ben on the floor, that’s been true for years now. He struggles in the half court in the playoffs but he’s a better player than John Wall. Easy choice"
"John wall can’t shoot, doesn’t pass, and can’t defend. Why is everyone still high on John Wall?"
"Ben Simmons IS a top 50 player in the league. John Wall isn’t, that’s true. However, Ben Simmons does not fit in and has no place in the 76ers. He provides good defense and decent playmaking, but he’s a guy who can’t shoot well and dominates the paint, but they have Joel to be able to do that. I don’t think people are saying Wall is better just rather that he would fit in better.   Edit:  I also want to say that the demise of the 76ers has had a lot of weight on Simmons. His issues are a large cause for the team’s failure. He’s had injury issues as well, which hurt them drastically in the 2020 playoffs, then he failed in the 2021 playoffs. Not to mention the lack of chemistry he currently has with the FO and more than likely the team"
Prime Gang Sign 1st Round John Wall… or Prime Untucked Finals Kyrie?
"john wall was statistically the worst high volume shooter last season lol, he's incredibly inefficient and he can't shoot 3s. It's like all the jokes about westbrook but 100x worse and actually true. he wouldn't even help spacing because every team will go under on screens and dare him to shoot.  ben simmons has also played  years of playoff games and there's only one series that he's been unplayable at the end of the 4th quarter,a and that was also the one year his ft% actually dipped below the hack-a-ben threshold. Every other year he's closed out games so saying he's unplayable s actual recency bias...  plus the one year simmons didn't play in the playoffs embiid and hte 6ers actually got swept lol  &gt;Wall too is good in transition  same as simmons lol  &gt;can create a bit   simmons can create for others and create decently enough for himself  &gt;used to be a neutral-to-positive defender at times.  does wall come with a time machine lol? plus simmons is a dpoy level perimeter defender while at his peak wall was just a good perimeter defender, and that was before his multiple devastating leg injuries  &gt;an ABSOLUTE negative on offense  actual hyperbole lol  &gt;Like are we forgetting watching the ""Hack a Ben"" games?  people arent forgetting (obv as its posted every day) but wall didn't even get the option to show what he can do in the playoffs bc as the lead guy he led a team to the 2nd overall pick lol"
And that was the last time John Wall was relevant — Obama’s second term.
Of course not. Sixers will get a better offer from pretty much every team in the league than John Wall.   Still doesn't make Ben a great fit alongside Embiid.
"John wall is making 40 million and is severely washed.hypothetically,  Do you really think sixers would even do that? I rather just take the malcolm brogdon indy trade than trade for john wall"
"In the 4th quarter final 5 minutes, Ben Simmons is UNPLAYABLE.    Forget John Wall, there are tons of players on every team that can at least be serviceable in the 4th quarter.    Wall too is good in transition, can create a bit and used to be a neutral-to-positive defender at times. Is Simmons' defense SO good that he can be an ABSOLUTE negative on offense and compensate?    Like are we forgetting watching the ""Hack a Ben"" games?"
John Wall will be better than Ben Simmons during playoffs
John Wall is done in the NBA. He’s going to rot in Houston with that untradable contract as they rebuild the right way
"I'm curious how you can confidently say John wall is washed? he averaged 20/7/3 in 40 games on that rockets team. I'm not here to say he's better than Simmons, or more valuable. but saying he is washed is just disrespectful."
John Wall low-key underrated
"So we trade him for John fucking Wall?? That’s the solution? Hell yeah, man."
Rockets say no. John Wall is the future
"I'm not a 76ers fan, but I'm assuming they'd like to trade Ben for pieces that actually contribute, and not the walking corpse of John Wall."
Well I guess first thing they should do is trade for John Wall. I probably wouldn’t put this post on your resume for Daryl if I were you
healthy john wall sure. but Wall right now? nawwwwwwwwwwwwww
That sound like a win-win for me. Did indiana already offered a package with brogdon? It's hard to believe how much ben simmons value dropped. i mean i saw the playoff embarassement as well but john wall? Really?
"I hate to say that about a player and i wish he prove me wrong, but the in the few houston games i watched last year, i saw john wall as a washed player. He can still play in the NBA but in a second role like a good bench player at best, and he still have 2 years at 40M on his contract. That is definitely the worst move philly could make for ben simmons imo."
"Yeah the very least - former government officials who know how to investigate people. If Melo got such a warning I wonder what Stern thought about DeRozan and John Wall, who both have pretty known gang affiliations."
Yes it is. John Wall will actually try and play
"John wall wouldn’t be afraid to shoot/attack/have ball in hand in the playoffs.  It doesn’t really matter what we think Simmons is capable of, even he forgets what he’s capable of in the playoffs.  He crumbles every year in the playoffs and last year was the worst example of it. Ben is at the point where if he doesn’t prove he can do it in the playoffs we are right to assume he can’t until proven otherwise (3 is a pattern etc etc)"
"I mean, if we're getting the same John Wall that earned that super max contract then yeah sure. But... we sure he still there?"
"Still worse for Philly. Ben can show up in February and can resume making however much of the $33MM he’s getting this year, plus the rest of the $113MM or so he’s guaranteed for the next 3 seasons. Combined with the $57MM he’s already earned, it’s not as if he’s in any financial danger. It would hurt. I realize it’s easy for me to sit here and say “Screw it, what’s $10MM” when it’s not my money, but he can afford to do it, if he really wants out.  Can Philly afford to take the $33MM in cap space they’ve used on him this year and just toss it into a volcano out of spite? And then what, to get a sulking player who wants out to come back and lay it all out on the court, even though he hates it there?   If I’m navigating Embiid’s prime, I’m doing everything I can to find a reasonable offer. I wouldn’t give Ben away and I think they can do better than John Wall, but they do not have the leverage here. Ben is a toxic asset for Philly right now and they want to get him out ASAP if they know what’s good for them."
"Ben Simmons purely as trade bait is better than John Wall and the remainder of his contract.  Also in the interview, Perk said that John Wall is still in his prime. I don’t know how much Ayahuasca I would need to consume to reach that conclusion, but needless to say it would be too much Ayahuasca."
"&gt; The Rockets asked for Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle and 2 picks. That's a reasonable ask for Harden, an underpay actually. Anything less than that would make it difficult to build around Ben Simmons in the Western conference. Morey wasn't willing to trade that much.  Call this a conspiracy theory if you want, but this ties directly into what I said about Fritata.  He didn't want to make the trade, so if that was the end game, why not ask for everything?  That ask was for Harden, a franchise guy and someone Fritata actually wanted to keep.  He has no such willingness with Wall, and therefore that's why I think he'd be willing to part with him for much less.  Remember what he said about CP3's contract being the worse one he's ever seen?  At the time, he had 2 more seasons with the Rockets for $36m and $41m until he was traded.  John Wall right now has 2 more seasons on his contract for $44m and $47m.  I believe Fritata would love to get rid of Wall and would sell low to do so.    And yes, Fritata doesn't want to pay the tax, so taking on a longer but smaller contract would absolutely make sense.  Ben Simmons is going to be paid $40m in 2024-2025, which is still less than what John Wall will be paid in the next 2 years.  To Fritata, he's bought himself extra time to get rid of Simmons if he doesn't want him.  And I agree, Simmons doesn't really make much sense for the Rockets, but players aren't judged in a vacuum.  Its not about how Simmons would fit, but if Wall would fit better.  I'd argue its very easy to see that Simmons at least fit better for the Rockets.  They don't even have to want to keep him, but his contract will be easier (and cheaper) to pay for and trade than Wall's.    And your last point I think makes the most sense with Simmons.  You're not going to get much for a John Wall and his $40+ million dollar contract, a PG on the downslide with injury concerns.  Very few teams would want that.  But as luck would have it, Philly is desperate for a change in scenery and would be willing to take a chance.  Like you said, the Rockets aren't signing any guys or keeping them once they do sign them.  They want cap relief, and relief in this case means getting rid of basically an unplayable asset who's being extremely overpaid, for one someone who's value is at an all time low and you can buy him up for cheap.  Yes, even if his contract is longer.  Even if he's got issues.  Because the Rockets are not trying to compete right now, so it doesn't matter if Ben goes 0/4 in the 4th quarter and shoots 35% from the FT line.  The Rockets will see him as a reclamation project, build up his value during the year and sell him for more than they've got for him.  A trade with Philly as a 1 to 1 swap (with maybe a couple of throwaways as filler) makes perfect sense: instant cap relief now, no pressure to play well for Simmons, buying low, later selling high, and you've got years to set up a deal to move him."
"Yes, which is why you are arguing for.. John Wall? To not be a step backwards? Dude legit cannot stay on the court. Last time he played more than half the season was 2016/17. Long ass time ago, Walls trade value is shit. Maybe trade deadline if he looks like 2016 John Wall but at this point it seems Wall will play out this massive contract and be a min or MLE player from here on out. He is 31 years old btw."
How much will the owners make lol  Top people should be payed less and the overall salary should be way higher with lifelong allowances to protect the players who dedicated everything to basketball and never learned math or money management or lived without a pillow life.  Cuz once your out of the league for most people is the start of entering the real world everybody else has been in since high school.   Without all the other guys the top guys would be nothing.  It really is a pyramid scheme.   Players should also only be paid for games they play in to avoid John wall and Luol Deng situations.  It would make the players all think about playing more safely and resting when they feel like they need it.  Basketball is too many games as well in the sake of money. If we saw these guys playing once or twice a week match we could see college Bball intensity in the nba.  It is a marathon season where a game really dosnt matter do a thirty game season and every game is hype.  Nba playoffs should be best of 5 as well as we always see way too many injuries and I have no idea who the better team as everybody is so gassed.  Nba is too much volume and not enough quality.  So many great players ravaged by too many games and subsequent injuries.  I want more of an nfl style season but nba be selling out those stadiums and the international money is big.  But it is not good for the players or the fans just the owners and very top faces of the nba.   Pyramid of wish I could see better basketball.   By the way our favorite players could have longer careers like Vince and Vince would have played up to 55 lol
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
"I really doubt John Wall is the best return Morey is being offered.... But if it somehow is, I don't blame him one but if he just runs it back with Ben. Despite all his threats there's no way Ben actually sits out an entire season."
You can also not take John Wall and Houston would still be willing to give him up for free.
"I mean, I would. Your franchise is gonna be trash for the first couple years anyway. John Wall is still a big enough name to attract attention, and you need big contracts to meet the salary floor."
"I think it's moreso about fit.  I don't agree.  But I think there's certainly an argument to be made that even a mediocre ""standard"" PG would fit better with this team than a guy who has to share the paint with Tobias and Embiid.  It's like if you have 4 shaqs on your team.  What would improve the team more?  Adding a fifth shaq?  Or adding John Wall.  Probably adding John Wall.  Doesn't mean he's a better player than Shaq was.  Just that it's a better fit."
"His best year he averaged almost 18 points a game. He averaged double figure points in 8 seasons. He had decent assist numbers and was a good shooter.   He played well in some big moments, contributing a lot to two championship teams.  Advanced metrics say that his career contributions are most similar to John wall, of active players.   So, he was very good, but never an All-Star."
Allen Iverson isn’t a current player.   John Wall maybe?
Oh yea John Wall was famous for making it out the second round
Okay that shit is now straight disrespectful lol. I know ben simmons value is low but no way it reaches john wall low
Because John Wall would be the #1 option in Vegas.
John Wall and Kevin Love
"I'm over the moon at the idea of the Sixers trading Simmons for a completely washed and injured John Wall. Please pull the trigger, Daryl."
"&gt; Cassell as a rookie was better than Smith at his absolute peak  Quite simply not true.  Smith by WS/48 was the Rockets' 3rd-best player in the 93-94 regular. He played 2209 minutes to Cassell's 1122, with a WS/48 of 0.132 to Cassell's 0.093. In general anything under 0.1 sucks, and mid 0.1s is a solid starter/rotation piece. Smith's PER in the regular was 14.2 and Cassell's was 13.1, both under league average by definition.  In the 94 playoffs things narrowed up but Smith was the Rockets' 4th-best player of the guys who got major minutes, and Cassell was their 5th best. Both were way better than Maxwell, who played like ass. The numbers for Smith v Cassell were WS/48 0.119 v. 0.111 and PER 14.7 v. 16.3. Cassell got to the line more. But their true shooting was 0.585 v. 0.537 in Smith's favor.  In 94-95 Smith again bettered Cassell in the regular, 0.144 to 0.120 in WS/48 and 16.2 to 15.9 in PER. (Maxwell was 0.044 and 11.9; his rep is way better than his actual documented performance.) In the 95 playoffs Cassell did outplay Smith, 0.132 to Smith's 0.101 in WS/48 and 17.8 to 13.8 in PER. Maxwell barely played, which probably helped the Rockets more than if he'd have been on the court.  Career-wise, it is true that Cassell had a longer and more effective career than Smith. Cassell's best season was 03-04 with Minnesota, when he made the ASG. Smith never made the ASG and his best years were either 90-91 or 92-93. Cassell was unquestionably a better player during a prime that ran from 97-98 to 03-04 or maybe to 05-06. Smith's prime was 90-91 through 94-95 and his prime wasn't as good as Cassell's. Smith was fairly ass in his pre-Rockets days, while Cassell got up to speed in his second season before taking a leap forward in effectiveness come 97-98.  (Maxwell, BTW, played 13 seasons and never recorded a WS/48 of 0.1 or better for a season. Advanced stats have him as a career-long liability at both ends of the court.)  Edit: FWIW basketball-reference similarity scores put Smith on par with contemporaries like Sprewell and Floyd, and in the modern era John Wall. Cassell's comps include include Dumars, Harper, Marbury, Lenny Wilkens and, amusingly, Isiah."
"It's hard to have Finals aspirations from just one single player addition, unless it's a superstar player. If the Philly system can work with John Wall and can fill in the gaps that Ben Simmons couldn't, they could possibly make it to the ECF.  Brooklyn and Milwaukee will still be the favorites. But anything could be possible if Joel Embiid has what he needs."
Simmons is literally elite at passing and handling. Chris Paul would help Embiid because he's a lot better than John Wall lol
"I think we’re heavily undervaluing top 40 players if they’re being compared to 2021 John Wall. It takes a haul to grab an upper-mid #2 option on a long contract; doesn’t matter if it’s a max. That said, it’s clear in retrospect that Philly shouldn’t have maxed him, and they’ve put themselves in a shit situation for getting big returns"
And you think John Wall is better?
"Nope, they don't. And frankly anybody who has a realistic picture of walls ability would agree with me. But you obviously don't because you've spent all morning trying to sell people on Simmons being worse than 31/32 year old John wall lol.  And people say sixers fans are delusional lol."
"John Wall is a below average player who will demand superstar level usage and who has the single worst contract in the league, and while Perkins threads should be deleted on sight at least it’s getting some of the absolute dumbest commenters in this subreddit to out themselves."
"Let's compromise! Ben Simmons plays on one end of all 82 games for a total of 41 games, and John Wall plays on boths ends of only 41 games. Now they're equal!"
A brick wall or John Wall?
Probably because John Wall has played a grand total of 41 games since 2018 and more than 41 games in a season just once since 2016. Dude hasnt been relevant since Obama got re-elected.
"Ok, but John Wall has aged 3 years and suffer massive injuries since the last time he played a postseason game"
John wall has played 41 games since 2018 and more than 41 games in a season just once since 2016. It’s absolutely a step down….
"John Wall is a better shooter than Ben, so at least he can kind of space the floor. Idk that he’d be that much worse than Ben, and with Ben they were the 1 seed."
"&gt; Maybe, John Wall won’t be the first option like he was most of the time in Washington before Beal blossomed  John Wall, like Ben, has the issue where he's very bad off ball, so if you don't give him full control of the offense your hurting your team in a different way."
"John wall hasn’t played well since 2018 and has since suffered two devastating injuries. He just got off a season where he looked terrible and missed time due to yet another nagging injury.  Yet despite this I keep seeing comments and threads saying things like he’d totally help the clippers or sixers. I just don’t see it, the dude just isn’t the same player anymore"
"people act like being a defensive juggernaut doesn’t even matter, john wall is nowhere near thr level of simmons on offense or defense anymore"
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
John wall will do more for you in a playoffs game than ben would
You obviously haven’t watched John Wall last year
Ben can play 82 games + post season. John Wall can't.
Agreed. There were definitely times last season where I liked John wall more than Westbrook but that could have been me just being bitter lol
I’m kind of shocked how many ppl agree with him in this thread.   I know they’ve lost in the 2nd round a few times now but Ben was just the 2nd best player on the 1 seed.   Prime John Wall is awesome but current John Wall was trash in about half the games he played last year. He is not a better fit with embiid  just because he shoots 30 percent from 3…
"""We'll give you Harden for Ben Simmons""  one year later  ""We'll give you the corpse of John Wall for Ben Simmons"""
"Lol delusional if you think the rockets are giving up assets. We dont want ben simmons, would have to be a 3 team trade where the Rockets take a couple filler salaries and give up john wall."
the point is that giannis threes are little to not contested. John Wall shoots the same percentages as giannis does but his shots are more contested by the defense.  And this in my opinion affects the way you look at the stat
"John Wall isn’t as bad of a player as people perceive but Simmons is just a mile better still, fit aside. Also Houston would have to sweeten the deal with additional players/picks, which puts a burden on Philly to add salary that they don’t have. This won’t happen in a million years"
The last team to trade for John Wall ended up with the worst record in the league.
Yeah I don’t know about that one Ben is uninvolved in much of the half court offense while John wall has made some sexy ass passes off the PnR. But John is a lot older than he was when I seen him play last.
"Maybe, John Wall won’t be the first option like he was most of the time in Washington before Beal blossomed.  And he can be a legit PG, he maybe isn’t the defender Ben is but he’s no slouch on defense"
I'd rather have Gary Neal than John Wall.
"he was an elite defender at the 1 along with cp3, conley, lowry, and maybe even bledsoe.   But now we have no clue where John Wall is at. Who knows if he can handle 50-60 games? And who knows if he can adapt to the modern game and play on a contender. There is a reason teams leave him wide open, he doesn't do anything off the ball.   I love the Wall Star but I watched him take Beal's shots for years."
Yes John Wall is a shadow of his former self. Ben Simmons is better all around besides shooting. John Wall still has that killer mentality though but just doesn’t got the juice like he used to. If Wall gets himself right though he could be a lethal scorer.
I’m going with John Wall on this one.
"John Wall has never had good shooting splits. Not really sure why you'd blame that on the Rockets personnel. He's very rarely been a consistent threat outside the paint. Sure he might be better in that area than Simmons, that doesn't mean he's not a liability."
Simmons is a bad fit with Embiid but it is actual lunacy to compare 2021 John Wall to him. John Wall has extraordinarily negative value on his current contract.
"yeah being an elite defensive player hasn’t helped his team get out of the second round. It’s overrated. NBA games are won by scoring points, not occasional  defense. Ben is a Defensive specialists like Tony Allen or Avery Bradley and shouldn’t be a max contract.   That’s how trash Ben Simmons is as an overall player. John wall looks like a better option."
"Imagine calling Simmons a negative asset in a discussion about him vs john wall who is the most negative asset in the NBA right now. For context Simmons is gonna make 33 mil next year and was an all star and DPoY runner up. John wall is gonna make 44 mil, shot 40% from the field, and basically every single advanced stat shows he was a negative player on the court NOT COUNTING the contract."
"Wall was a better player than Simmons has ever shown to be before his injuries piled up, complete recency bias. This whole thread is straight up disrespectful to Wall who was put in a terrible position to show what he still has in the tank last year. The Rockets had injury issues and tanked once Wood got hurt. John Wall is a better player in the playoffs right now today than Ben Simmons has ever shown to be. Unless the Sixers are content with being regular season bullies and playoff chokers then I’d rather have Wall. Walls playoff numbers throughout his career are insane, he turns it up a notch every time he’s in there. So what if wall shoots 35%? It’s better than Ben Simmons being to scared to shoot period because of his fragile ego."
"yeah no, go watch literally 10 games from the Rockets where John Wall played this year and see if you still think he is better than Simmons"
yeah no and John Wall isn’t better than him
If all the sixers can get for Simmons is John wall then that’s a sad sad day for sixers fans.
This is ridiculous. Washed John Wall is not better than Ben full stop. Perk is a dummy.
2014 John Wall sure
"lol Who do y’all think John Wall is?  He’s not a bad defender by any means. He’s gonna end up on a playoff team,  become very solid and you guys will act surprised"
Was it because we never saw the full potential of John Wall die to injuries?
"2017 John Wall would’ve clapped Lowry’s fruity cheeks any day of the week. All-Defense, averaging 10+ assists, name one thing he did better. Kyle Lowry has to be the most overrated player I’ve seen here holy shit."
I've said it before on this sub but John Wall was incredibly human and relatable and I've met so many motherfuckers that thought they were John Wall and were assholes and then it turns out John Wall was a genuine human being. Go figure.
"Kyle Lowry &gt; John Wall, even in his prime"
&gt; john wall and wiggins had ALOT of hype  A lot of draft scouts really soured on Wiggins by draft time and were at the point where they said a team willing to risk the health issues should just pick Embiid
"Is this like a combo of Gilbert Arenas, Bradley Beal and John Wall combined?"
"Every city’s media does this. Look at the convos that were had about John Wall and Brad Beal, Kyrie and Bron, Kobe and Shaq and on and on. It’s almost like a natural inevitable part of the sports drama cycle."
John “Tank Commander” Wall
"lebron, by a long shot.  &amp;#x200B;  john wall and wiggins had ALOT of hype"
Simmons' contract is terrible. $35 Million per year for the next 4 years for a #3 option. Simmons' contract is worse than Porzingis and John Wall.
"I love your content and agree! I’ve long tinkered with the idea that the real value of All-Star Players is how many unconventional (tweener, strech bigs, etc.) they allow you to play in the lineup. Lebron is famous for taking one dimensional players and allowing them to play at a starter level (Mario Chalmers, JR Smith, etc.).   I thought this was most evident when John Wall - Otto Porter Jr. played together, since it was clear that John’s creation was single-handily creating the opportunity for OPJ when Beal was hurt and OPJ’s shooting converted those opportunities. On top of that, Wall and OPJ’s top tier defense allowed the Wizards to play lesser defenders at other spots that traditionally anchor the defense (PF &amp; C)."
Indy sending out Brogdon and LeVert to end up with John Wall? :D can you even trade that many firsts?
"This is a not an accurate comparison, demarcus had achilles and acl on the same leg while klay had it on different legs.   He was projected to start last season on opening night, it was reported that he was fully healthy from his ACL injury (about 15 months from he got hurt).  This means he is coming back from achilles injury alone and seeing what KD and John Wall did last year makes me pretty optimistic seeing Klay back to 80-90% of himself."
"Bouknight has good NBA perimeter players on his team tho, less opportunities. Green is gonna take every shot John Wall was supposed to take lol"
"John Wall was at least a neutral defender during his all-star years. Obviously his injuries have slowed him down and being part of a tanking team has affected how much effort he puts in, but he has shown that he is capable."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"Not even that. Let’s look at the next years draft class.  Dwight Howard still around but a bit player.   Next draft. Bogut. retired.   Heck, 2009 6 years AFTER, Blake Griffin and 2010, John Wall, both just bit players now."
" John Wall was the better defender and I thought he was more explosive, but give me D-Will. He was a more efficient scorer and more skilled passer IMO  A more interesting question would be peak-to-peak. 2017 John Wall was pretty good"
"A think a 3rd team will be involved in any trade with Simmons.. Maybe the Rockets. John Wall, Simmons, Brogdon, LeVert and maybe Danny Green or Maxey...shake and stir, throw a bunch of draft pics and pick swaps and hope for the best.  Pacers get John Wall and Danny Green or Maxey Philly gets Brogdon and LeVert Rockets get Simmons  TBH, I have no fucking ideia what I'm doing..."
"I think it’s a misinterpretation of the word “overpaid” on either your end or mine. Just because Simmons is overpaid does not mean he inherently nets negative value.   I’m not telling you what I personally believe he’s worth, I’m telling you the stats as to how he’s overpaid. GMs hand out maxes based on win shares and projected win shares - their goal is to win. Every max player in the league other than Simmons, Love and John Wall rank in the 80th percentile for win shares. His production is not that of a max contract. Right now he’s objectively overpaid - yet, he can still be desirable for a team banking on his potential, or a team desperate to change things up for various reasons."
I always thought he’d be John Wall-lite after watching his Hoopmixtape.
"Over the last 4 years the sixers have steadily declined in 3PA per game, finishing last season right around 27th.   We have one of the most dominate paint players in the league, and have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.   Sixers fans have been quick to say buddy is lacking in defense or other aspects of his game, but we so desperately need a high volume shooter, I struggle to see how he would not immediately make our offense flow better.   Would love if they found a way to get him on the squad.   For reference - last year, Danny Green was our leading 3 point shooter in terms of volume at just 6.3 attempts per game. After that, it was furkan korkmaz and seth curry at 4.9 each. Then we have a steep drop off to Tobias Harris at 3.4 attempts per game.   Further, Danny Green's 6.3 attempts per game ranked him at 48th overall in total attempts, just .1 attempts ahead of John Wall.   All that is to say, Sixers fans should reconsider their desire to have Hield on the team. He's one of the best volume 3 point shooters in recent history."
I didn’t like putting John Wall or Deron Williams here so I chose Payton
I didn’t like putting John Wall or Deron Williams here so I chose Payton
Yeah I didn't like doing it but when I start a MyLeague I put all the injuries in and trade all the players that teams are currently trying to move. Traded John Wall to Clippers for Bledsoe and Kennard and a 2nd round pick. Moved Love and Buddy too
"Helped John Wall get a bag, right after Draymond signed with Klutch, he got that huge extension, he got Aaron Gordon that huge extension as well, etc"
They can take John wall for a sandwich just stop threatening to send over Simmons.
No his passing is actually one of his best skills.  He averaged 6 assist last year sharing the floor with John Wall as backup.  Now he’s the starting full time PG.
Dude is so fast with the basketball.  He’s very reminiscent of John Wall.
Please trade him for John Wall so he can retire and we can get some cap relief
Nah he not John Wall. Imagine if Lowry was 6’4 and more athletic though
I still don’t get how John Wall managed to have such a massive contract lol
&gt; The ringer did a piece on it here. Otto Porter with the 3rd overall pick is about average value. That’s a top 3 pick who at his peak was a good starter but generally a role player. So trading a top 10 pick on average isn’t worth much.  I feel like this doesn't account for power laws and the exponential value of acquiring a GOAT. The value of the picks is in the upside tail that it turns into an all time great on the level of Larry Bird or Kevin Garnett.   A #1 pick might have a ~10% chance to turn into that  A #5 pick might have like like a 5% chance.   A #10 pick might have like a 1% chance.   So a #10 pick still has serious value. I'd say a 1% chance at LeBron is worth more than a 100% chance of a Blake Griffin. So saying a typical #1 pick turns into Blake Griffin or John Wall isn't the right way to distill its value. Really the value of the pick is the small chance it turns into the GOAT.
"it’s more that john wall won’t give up money, he doesn’t want a buyout"
Am i wrong to say i see a little john wall in him
"I met John Salley in Santa Monica at a cigar joint right around the time Bill Cosby was accused of drugging and raping all those women. He said ""he didn't do shit"" all of us were like dude wtf are you talking about? There's like 50 accusers! He said, ""listen, I was there, none of you were. I don't care what the news says, he didn't do shit.""   I'm not sure how this relates to his judgement on John Wall and Steph Curry, but yeah, I wouldn't take anything he says seriously."
John Wall was the fastest player in the league
Prime John Wall was really a sight to see. It’s a shame what happened to him.
Steph curry is nowhere near the dunker that john wall is
"On top of that, Harden already had a max contract when Paul was here. Assuming John Wall is gone by the time Wood renews, he’d be the only one on the team signed to a max contract. Every team has to have at least one face of the team and you have to pay for it"
can't agree with John Salley on this one. i think Steph is better than John Wall. thoughts?
I didn’t realize it until this moment but Kevin Porter Junior is my favorite player now lol. Idk just feels weird   25/4/8 on 44/38/80 splits finishes top 3 in MIP voting. John Wall not playing is gonna open up a lot of doors for him. Probably doesn’t hit his 10Ast goal but improves across the board.
"How does Otto Porter have this close in value to John Wall though? WAR seems like a very flawed stats in that not only does it say that Otto is better than Demar, it even says that the gap between those two is bigger than the gap between Otto and Wall."
John Wall absolutely destroyed his legs but still has blazing fast speed. After Durant and Rudy Gay as well I think he will be fine. I think we’ve hit an age of sports medicine where these injuries don’t crush people’s careers as bad.
I feel John Wall is bad enough to wrap back around to being interesting especially since it's due to injuries. Wiggins is just a guy that no one talks about unless it's about this or his unreached potential.
"I think it's a combination of both. However, I don't think a guy staying with the same team their whole career is the only determining factor of being loyal. People need to drop that idea, because a team can trade a player who's given their best years to an organization.  John Wall was every bit as loyal to Washington (if he was ever caught moping like Beal, he would've been torn to shreds), but, it doesn't seem to count, since he's not with the team anymore."
"Watch these two videos and tell me russ is as good a passers as John wall  https://youtu.be/ScoDX66rWJs  https://youtu.be/kQjUCZnSKeY  Wall sees smaller windows, threads tougher passes, creates more opportunities with slick ball moves. Westbrook leverages his overwhelming athleticism to create simple looks."
"I could have sworn Beal was already like 31, the same age as John Wall. I guess they were a duo for so long, I kind of confused their ages."
John wall?
"Here's the list of players who hit 10APG in the last few years.  2020: Russell Westbrook  2019: LeBron James  2018: Russell Westbrook  2017: Russell Westbrook  2016: James Harden, John Wall, Russell Westbrook  In short, you have to go back to the 2016-2017 season to find more than one player averaging 10 APG in a season. Obviously, it's not impossible, but if your name isn't LeBron James or Russell Westbrook, both of whom are unlikely to hit it this year because they're teammates, it's highly unlikely."
John Wall was the Tank Commander
John Wall the tank general from Washington. The Washington General if you will
"I feel like this is only the narrative because people don’t like harden. Like leading into the season, everyone was talking about the new houston coach and how he would use a team basketball approach and dogging harden because he wouldn’t be able to be like a playmaker/team player. Then harden not only commits to playing the more team oriented, less-iso style (which naturally cuts down his shot attempts) then he also gets hurt and is now playing in a new system where he’s not supposed to hunt his shot as often while dealing with being hurt. Was his scoring off? Yea but he also averaged 10 assists. It’s a work in progress.   In Brooklyn, they just let him be himself so he reverted to normal (also doesn’t hurt when you go from playing with John wall and Daniel house to KD and Kyrie)"
disrespectful to John Wall to not call him the general after what he did for us
John Wall was a pretty good tank commander too
* Bulls are frauds and miss the playoffs * Raptors get back in the playoffs and takes the Knicks spot * Indiana and Charlotte also make the playoffs * Ben Simmons gets traded for a garbage package * Nets end up getting John Wall and Kevin Love when they get bought out * Kawhi returns by the playoffs
Jaylen brown and John Wall janitor now? Kool
John wall. At his peak he put up 23ppg/11apg/4rpg/2spg had two really good playoff runs. Too many knee injuries tho.
John Wall fines the Rockets every time he's put in trade talks lmaooo
"Probably John Wall and D Rose, I was a huge fan of both  Most of the guys I can think of were really gonna be All Star types at best though, like Parsons"
"Based on their buzz John Wall and Andrew Wiggins. So much hype, I know now to take it all with a grain of salt. If these prognosticators were so gifted, they’d be in a draft war room, not spilling ink for ESPN."
reminds me of when john wall kept reinjuring himself doing mundane things at home
"“Maybe John Wall” if Houston wants to move John Wall they have to attach every available pick they have lol. Genuinely the worst contract in NBA history. Bad when it was signed (Wiz didn’t really have a choice), just unbelievably bad after the injuries."
"Maybe John Wall? You are seriously underrating Simmons. He's a bad offensive player in the half-court, but still does a good job getting to the rim, is great in transition, a fantastic defensive player, and an excellent rebounder. There's still a lot of  value in players who do those things as well as Ben. There's no comparison between him and John Wall at this stage of their careers"
Philly can get no one else except maybe John Wall. Simmons can’t produce on offense so they can’t get a Mcollum type player. He’s worth a fringe all star like himself. He’s not a Jamal Murray or CJ type player. He’s not even on the same level as Draymond
It's not like a John Wall contract though. If they wanted to trade him they could easily find a good deal.
Feel better by flipping John Wall to the Thunder for a first rounder in 2k
john wall also earns more than okcs active roster
"The quote in the title of this post says that the trade value of Kyrie Irving is ""virtually zero"".  That's still a lot more than the trade value of John Wall, which is ""negative tens of millions of dollars""."
It’s John Wall. 😁😁😁
Wouldn’t that mean the Nets would have to want John Wall?
I'm ready to trade him for John Wall at this point.
Houston is hoping John Wall is anti-vaxxed.
Why would his value go down? I mean his current value is Malik Beasley or John Wall. What’s lower than that?
And now they're gonna end up with John Wall
John Wall? Just an off the top off the head guess… he is fast and might work with this timeline.
John Wall tore his achilles slipping and falling at home and was paid in full
Oh god it doesn't feel like that long ago I was watching John Wall highschool mixtapes
Honestly John wall and boogie cousins aren’t that far away from retirement
John Wall will never sniff a max again in his career while Ben might get another one. Their POV's are vastly different on this topic.
"Rich people don't think like that, John Wall made close to $300 million but right now he is trying to sell some  NFT project nobody cares for."
take me back to 2017 John Wall all NBA Bradley Beal 23 PPG first ever Otto Porter could still play and Gortat
John wall?
Big talk for a team that imploded and is left with a hobbled bad contract John wall. Come back when your team gets over .500.
I'd be insanely surprised if John Wall who's made over 280m in just NBA contracts manages to go bankrupt.
"Lol this is advice for people making 100-200k a year not millionaires. You vacation all you want, have a fancy car and a huge lavish home and still be set for generations even with career earnings of 10-20mil in the NBA.  Just don’t do extraordinary stupid shit like John wall blowing 50k in one night on a strip club or buying a new car in every city."
John Wall
"A package with Simmons also doesnt include KPJ or Jalen zGreen who werent part of the package, but consequences of the decision  Knowing that, thank god we did what we did. Simmons would be having this same tantrum but in Houston, and we’d be just as far from beeing a contender as we are right now, because Simmons aint doing shit for a teams championship aspirations when his backcourt partner is John Wall for 3 years"
John wall for Simmons ?
"Regardless of the veracity of this claim, Harden for Simmons would have been so much better for the league than what ultimately transpired. I also wonder what the reaction the Kyrie's vaccine stance would be if he and Durant were the only superstars on the team.  But at this point, if I'm a Rockets fan (as much as I hate to admit it), I'm thrilled with the current roster outside of John Wall. Just a wealth of young talent that negates the crappy picks I got back for the greatest offensive player ever."
"I, for one, am ready for the John Wall era in GSW to begin."
"I personally think AD is more parallel to KG. Both are versatile defenders. Great face up and midrange game. Better 2nd options than 1st options. Both have the same build and doesn’t necessarily dominate physically. To me, Giannis reminds me of a taller Charles Barkley/Tim Duncan hybrid.  unstoppable in transition, dominates you in the post, questionable shooting excellent help defender. Also, I think Luka is more like Bird because they aren’t necessarily the best athletes but controls the game in every aspect with a sweet shooting touch.   I would like to add that Hakeem and Embiid have similar playstyles.   De’Aaron Fox = John Wall  Jrue Holiday = GP  Prime Rajon Rondo = JKidd  CJ McCollum = Monta Ellis  Before anyone downvotes me, I am not saying they are at their levels. I am just saying they have similar play styles in my eyes. Feel free to disagree."
"Reddit: Listen, Bradley, going from no vax to vaxxed is like going from being teammates with John Wall to Russell Westbrook.  Bradley Beal: Hmmm, I think I get it.... so Kyle Kuzma is the booster shot?"
Fingers crossed those back issues don't pop up again because if they do this contract is going to be like the next John Wall contract
We want playing time for our young guys not john wall basically.
So John Wall is just going to punt his age 31 season after working to come back from injury?
John Wall!
Damn where's that love for John Wall
This is as random as when John Wall tripped at home and tore up his Achilles.
Nah even when you see simmons in practice you can tell. The other day the clips of him against John wall nobody was even trying
John wall?
John wall is one of my favorite players but he’s not on Kyrie’s level at this point. Maybe worth it if Kyrie for sure won’t play though.
lol john wall
john wall  imo he'll be motivated at a shot at a ring
"I mean Tillman’s tenure with the Rockets has been extremely short. But he turned a perennial WC contender with James Harden into a bottom of the barrel team with John Wall.   Obviously the situation is more nuanced than how I’m describing it but by all accounts Tillman seems to be a fucking cheapskate and handles his employees, including and outside of the Rockets, very poorly.   As with Sarver, he’s a known cheap owner, and it really seems like he’s gonna be Sterling 2.0 so I think it’s fair to say that he’s a step below Dolan.  Not to say Dolan isn’t a bad owner, but it seems at the very least that he cares about his team’s performance and is willing to spend to contend. Yeah he threw some people out of MSG, but so did the 6ers when fans were wearing Hinkie shirts. Yeah he has animosity towards former players like Oakley, but so does Minny’s ownership with KG.   In my opinion, billionaires are the scum of the earth for how they exploit people and they act like drama queens when they don’t get exactly their way because they’re so accustomed to everyone bending over backwards to blow them. I mean look at Elon calling the dude that rescued those Thai kids a pedo lol. Billionaire sports teams owners are no different than Tech billionaires or hedge fund managers. They all suck to some degree. But imo in the context of owning a team the worst quality an owner can have is being cheap. Dolan, at the very least, is willing to spend, which puts him above his peers like Sarver and Tillman who just seem like they bought a team to have it appreciate in value and dgaf about performance."
"Yes, for John Wall."
john wall to the mavs
I think last year was probably CP3's best/final shot at a title.     I will also go out on a limb and predict that Zion never wins one.  He already seems to have some injury concerns and that big body is not going to hold up too long if he doesn't learn to maintain it.   I will also throw John Wall out there as an easy one.  He was legit one of the best PG's in the game until he got hurt.  I would definitely have considered him a superstar but it doesn't seem like he will ever get back to what he was.
Come on man you can't compare current Kevin Love and his contract to Ben Simmons. There is a massive gap there currently in ability and his youth and trajectory make that idea even more laughable. You could have said John Wall to make a slightly better point but even that wouldn't really work because of his injury history and age as well.
"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
Tobias and John Wall leading that Rockets team to the Finals was so bizarre. John Wall suddenly shooting 45% from 3 in the playoffs doing 32 and 10 a game. Greatest comeback season in nba history
"&gt;Tristan - got paid Bledsoe - got paid Jr - got paid Draymond - 100M JOHN WALL - robbed the league.  &gt;If rich paul is doing it wrong, show me who’s doing it right  So spot on"
John Wall hoopmixtape is also all time. Special shoutout as well to Kiwi Gardner aka the Bay Areas Best Kept Secret
"Yeah.  I agree w that.  Hedo was just the one that stuck w me the most after all these years.  Completely forgot that arenas went to orlando.  Nephews just don't know how amazing Arenas was - he was like John wall and dame put together.  Lightening quick and 3s for days!  Speaking of wishful thinking, I wish I could see Tmac and healthy Grant Hill, too!!!"
"the one thing I will give Dame which Dwight doesn't get discounted for..Dame has been playing in a guard heavy era. During Dame's career he's had to compete with Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall (when he was good), Isaiah Thomas (when he was good), Chris Paul, Kyrie, Kyle Lowry, I mean this era has been one of the most stacked guard eras in a while.   Meanwhile Dwight was making first team as a Center in an era where Shaq in PHX was 3rd team, Andrew Bogut who never made an All Star game is 3rd team, Tyson Chandler who's never made an All Star team was 3rd team. Usually the second best Center was Amare Stoudemire who's more of a Power Forward really, so yeah Dwight was making first team as literally the only TRULY dominant center during his era. Dame is out here missing First Team All NBA because he's behind Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, aka guys that are all on the top 75. Dwight Howard never had to beat a top 75 guy to make All NBA. Dame could very well get 1st team the next 3-4 years now that CP3 has cooled off, Westbrook has cooled off, Curry is still hot but maybe Dame has as good of year."
"Can we name them? Everyone is saying CP3; maybe you’ll say Muggsy Bogues, John Wall, Rondo, or Gary Payton.  May be same height, but different build, different wingspan, different strength, different vertical, different weight.  Dude is 180 lb 6’3” with a 6’4” wingspan, a 35 inch vertical, weak as fuck, and has the hardest off-ball offensive role in league history; he is still able to make all his defensive rotations / assignments, get off contests, and rarely gets blown by, except by players that blow by everyone."
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren’t “superstars” but everyone I’ve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
"We’re overrating mere attempts at shots players are bad at. John Wall and Russell Westbrook are high volume, horrible mid range shooters. They have had great careers. Going by what you’re saying, would they somehow be lesser players if they took out their mid range game?  There are about a dozen active players that are or have been all-stars as ball dominate non-shooters, most of which are the defender or passer that Ben is. Ben is just generally offensively unaggressive; he doesn’t need a jumpshot, he needs to be more aggressive.   Stop listening to sports media attempts to farm clicks and watch games. Ben Simmons can be (*and already was*) an All-NBA/Star player on only dunks and layups and horrible free throw shooting."
"Listen I know role players aren't superstars but there is one simple thing you're misunderstanding here: the role players would actually be fucking playing the game lol. There is under no circumstances, a benefit to paying a player to not play the game. I dont even know why you're trying to argue that. It's like saying the Wizards shoulda kept John Wall despite him never being on the court. What the hell does that do other than hold up cap for someone who's NOT PLAYING??? Like yea we're gonna waste a peak Embiid year by sending him out there with whatever we got left instead of trading for more help???? Ok i guess lmao.  Im sorry i guess we just fundamentally disagree because i will absolutely take picks and good capable role players who actually help a team, over a player who doesn't wanna be there, won't play and plays you out of important games when he does play. Yall have fun with that lol"
Reminds me of John Wall and Rose pre injury
John Wall must’ve been 77. That seems like something he’ll say soon
"John wall prob worse but in context with having a superstar with no help, it’s pretty bad"
"Don't jump on my ass, real question, who are the players who have been offloaded by their teams and were openly pissed about the location? I can't think of top-tier players who have been dumped onto bad teams. John Wall maybe?"
"Bro if you could do that Kevin Love, John Wall, Westbrook (if LAL could open 44m in cap space they would do it) and any other underperforming massive contract you can think of would just get suspended for bullshit reasons. It would be fucked up but if it was allowed why not."
"John Wall and Kevin Love are 30+ guys with extensive injury histories their teams signed up for. I'd agree Kevin Love has been a little bitch about it too, but he's on the legacy ring contract, we all knew that would age like milk"
"Fuck it, trade Westbrook for John Wall"
"Still better than John Wall, a 44 million dollar non-player."
John Wall has no problems with Ernie *throws up blood sign*
If OKC was tanking because they sat Horford for half of last season then that means Houston is tanking because their sitting John Wall for the entire upcoming season.
Is John wall even playing this season??
Not so fun fact: the only player to take at least 15 FGA/G and to have a worst TS% than Westbrook last year was John Wall.
"A john wall for westbrook trade would never happen, that’s ridiculous"
"Key word there: “had”. As in past tense. He’s not the same player he used to be. The only player last year to take at least 15 FGA/G and be less efficient than him was John Wall, and Russ always drops in efficiency come playoff time too.   The only way a team could deal with his short comings in the postseason is by bringing him off the bench. I’m willing to bet he’ll actually get benched in a key playoff game. I doubt Bron and AD are gonna put up with the way he’s played in the postseason the last 5 years."
It's too early to trade Russell. He deserves a little more slack.   John Wall might even be a better choice. At least you could say John has never been given an opportunity to defer or play within a confined system. Russell has been in this situation several times over 10 plus years and really has never put it together.
They won’t fire Vogel. It’s not his fault. I’m hoping to see a Russ trade. I would almost take anyone…John wall? Haha
A negative one nonetheless. I don’t see teams banging down the door for John Wall. It can only be traded for another bad salary or a pure dump. And the problem is the Lakers don’t have the assets for a dump.
Westbrook looking like John wall
John Wall is a better fit on the Lakers than Russ.
Has to hurt in the soul when LeBron trades him to Houston for John Wall.
Is John Wall better than Westbrook?
I would rather have Simmons ride the bench for 4 years straight than trade for John Wall on that contract
John Wall?
Isn’t Houston basically already doing that with John Wall?
"That means nothing. If Houston called them and offered John Wall for Hield and Bagley, and they refused that shitty ass trade, that doesnt mean the Kings are in the wrong by ""refused trade offers."""
John Wall.
You think John Wall would give up a penny of his $92 million over the next two seasons?
"Honestly though if hes gonna act like this then the Sixers are better off if he doesn't play right now. He's a great player but if hes disengaged in games thats worse than having a young guy like Maxey giving max effort (and actually shooting). They'd be playing like 4 on 5 completely when he clearly doesn't want to play. Eventually though things will happen with injuries, slow starts for certain teams and a deal gets done even if its not for a star level player but I don't think that'll be until December or January. He obviously makes us better if he plays fully engaged but half hearted Ben is just gonna cause ripples in the lockerroom and be a distraction. May just end up like John Wall where they tell him to stay home until they find a suitable trade"
Clippers seems much more likely. He worked out with a bunch of there guys in the off season and is good friends with them too. Ty Lue resurrecting careers also sounds appealing if you’re John Wall.
Ya'll think Tilman really buying out John Wall? I doubt it.
"at this point, i'd actually be disappointed if we traded john wall for him straight up. ben just seems to be locker room covid"
I guess we can do john wall for simmons and 2 first.
Guess you don't remember Demarcus Cousins being passive aggressive with Harden in the media that year. Or John Wall saying the situation was disappointing.
I think the only realistic trade is sending BS and at least one pick for John Wall.
Damn just take the John wall deal already
"Even if they get desperate they'll want a like for like trade and probably flip him to someplace like Houston for John Wall.  Best likelihood to trade Simmons is a 3 way trade where Philadelphia gets a decent but overpaid player on an underperforming team, Simmons goes to OKC, and prospects go from OKC to the 3rd team"
He probably was deflated. They had him out there with the corpse of John Wall &amp; 7 D League players.
"the ""harden situation"" was way overblown, bro wanted out cause the team clearly passed their prime, they literally traded for john wall bro   he'd been asking out for years and they wouldn't listen"
1st team all not engaged:   G: Ben Simmons  G: John Wall  F: Zion Williamson  F: Kevin Love  C: Kristaps Porzingis
"Yeah, but you kind of cherry-picked a questionable contract that ended up paying off. Hindsight is 20/20. Look at the Clipper’s CP3 contract, the Clipper’s Blake Griffin contract, the John Wall contract, OKC Russ contract, etc.   So many expensive contracts given out for the sake of contention that aren’t rewarded and the teams are punished later when the money makes the player untradeable."
If John wall got traded with his contract and injury history I'm sure the suns could find a way to trade a maxed out ayton
"He came in the league with John Wall, one year before Kyrie was drafted."
"I’m not comparing him to the rest of the league though, such as big men, I’m comparing him to SGs as his contributions to Boston can be compared with other guard’s contributions to their teams.  He’s the 10th highest paid SG, 26th highest paid Guard going into 2021-22 and performing with the aforementioned stats. He’s paid accurately, not overpaid, not underpaid. Only guards that are making more than him and aren’t better are De’Aaron Fox ($28M), D’Angelo Russell ($30M), CJ McCollum ($30.8M), Ben Simmons ($33M), John Wall ($44.3M) - those guys are probably overpaid, even if it is slightly. Maybe throw Klay Thompson ($37.9M) because we haven’t seen him in 2 years, and Westbrook at $44.2M. I wouldn’t say he should be paid at their levels because those guys are overpaid, hence Brown is paid accurately for his contributions."
"&gt; If that's your philosophy then no player in the NBA with a contract is overpaid because someone at some point was willing to pay that player that much money to play on their team.  Yes and no. Some players are on a bad contract and the team can't get out from under it. Like John Wall or Andre Drummond before they bought him out. He was clearly overpaid because they paid him a bit less to just go away. But the Warriors aren't even considering that. They like him and they're willing to pay him. And more importantly, they traded for him at this price. And they're getting pretty much what they expected. No Warriors fan would say they expected better. His ceiling before that trade is pretty much where he is. A solid NBA player who will be a great #3 on a championship caliber team. Would they have paid him a Max deal as a free agent? Probably not. But we can't sign free agents because of our cap situation. So because of that, we have to take the contracts we can get. Remember, we chose to take D-Lo as a Max guy. We didn't need to. And we turned him into Wiggins and Kuminga. So that's baked into ""overpaying"" for Wiggins. Much like if I sold you my house for 600K and you said it's too much so I threw in my boat. You didn't pay 600k for the house. I think too many fans view these situations in isolation. And you just can't. If people really think Wiggins is overpaid, you have to name me a player that is just as good and is cheaper. And you'd also have to tell me how the Warriors get that other player and pocket the difference. Because that would show that he's overpaid. Because you can replace him for less. But the Warriors have no ability to do that. Every team has to follow the rules of the league and the rules are build around the Warriors doing what they did because they wanted Wiggins at the price it costed them. So IMHO, that is his value right now. When his deal is up, it will probably be quite a bit less. More like 22 a year or something. Because that's what he will be able to command at that time. At this time, it's 31 and the Warriors said ""OK""."
"&gt; Do you think Wiggins is worth 31 mil?  Too many different ways to answer that question. None of us know the Warriors financials. He could be worth 200 million to the franchise but only paid 31 because of the salary cap. We have no idea how much revenue he specifically brings to the team. Compared to Steph Curry? No way. Steph is 10X as valuable to the franchise compared to Wiggins. But is Steph underpaid or is Wiggins overpaid? Compared to John Wall and Andre Drummond? He's underpaid. My overall philosophy is that if someone wants to pay you to do something, that is what you're worth."
*John Wall likes this*
No because the range is 6 million which I feel is a sizeable range. If I do anymore I feel like these contracts aren't really similar to wiggins anymore  And about John wall: there can be more than one bad contract in the league. Is your mind blown yet? And yes some contracts can be worse than wiggins.  E: if I include John wall the range of contracts I include is 22 million.
My personal top 5 (excluding Magic and MJ):  1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Derrick Rose  5. Rajon Rondo
But John Wall already broke out years ago
"&gt; Yes, six extra possessions a game will lead to probably an extra shot per game for star players.  Then what are you debating? All I said in the beginning was those 6 possessions don't translate into 6 FGA for a single star player. Pure nonsense. We're not talking about superstars # of possessions here, we're talking about league wide averages.   &gt; fucking idiotic.   I'll REALLY dumb it down for you.  Most players past the 20 point mark are not high volume players like Mitchell and Tatum taking 20.6 shot attempts. Superstars increasing their FGA is irrelevant because we're talking about why there are more influx of these 20 point players in general. There's like 30 players on the 2021 list **where IF YOU REDUCED THEIR FGA to 15-16 shot attempts (average of borderline 20 PPG players in 2014) WHILE MAINTAINING SAME EFFICIENCY, they'd STILL GET PAST the 20 point mark**. Read that slowly 15 times, I'm sure you'll get it.   You only need 58% TS to get 20 points on 15 FGA 5 FTA, or 56.5% TS to get 20 points on 15 FGA 6 FTA. And guess what the fcking league average is now compared to 2014?   So no fcking shit increasing FGA = increasing PPG. My whole point is most of these guys would already get past the 20 PPG mark on lower volume just based on how much star efficiency has risen (as well as the sheer number of talented stars gulfing 2014). Only guys like John Wall gets past 20.6 points due to increased FGA and not due to efficiency. It's that simple."
"what are you talking about you ?? You didnt say anything about where they were at in their careers you said "" the NBA 10 years ago had so much less talent than today overall"". They were playing in the league.You realize that Curry,Harden,Westbrook, all played in the league more than 10 years ago right? Along with Paul George,John wall,Blake,Jrue,Demar."
"For the record, Rose has a HoF probability of about 12% according to Basketball Reference  Behind guys like Al Horford, John Wall, Kemba Walker.  Unless he has some magical reawakening and elevates his game to MVP caliber Rose for a few years, he's not getting in."
"John Wall had the same issues, and finally when he fell of due to injuries they couldnt wait to shit on him."
John Wall has a breakout year and we get a Jazz v Rockets conference finals for a funky mothership courtesy of George Clinton
"Lamelo has the higher ceiling and is more versatile. Ja is similar to John Wall pre injury slashing PG solid playmaking but Lamelo’s height, playmaking, potential growth on defense just by being 6’7/6’8 just gives him more upside than Morant. His deep range and shot creating skills look more fluid and natural where as Morant is really dependent on slashing as a 6’3 guard there are limitations to his play style."
"Greatest team of all time that lost their whole bench when he joined.   Question: since people generally argue that the core of the warriors (steph, klay, draymond and iggy) made them the best. Do you not think they are still the best? If not, why? Don’t give me the “they are old now” excuse because Steph is playing at his peak atm, draymond is still good, klay will be fine (Achilles to John wall and kd have shown modern medicine is amazing)."
"You guys got a good one in him. As a die hard John Wall lifer, wishing the best for you all this year"
"Not really. Since the lottery, Ewing took the Knicks to multiple conference finals and 2 finals, David Robinson took the Spurs to a conference finals and won 50 games like every year, Shaq took the Magic to the finals, Iverson took the Sixers to the finals, Duncan got the Spurs 5 rings, Lebron took the Cavs to the finals, Dwight took the Magic to the finals, Rose took the Bulls to multiple conference finals. Those are all franchise altering players. Then you’ve also got great players like Derrick Coleman, Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Glenn Robinson, Elton Brand, Yao Ming, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and KAT.   If you want to be relevant, then getting the number one pick is an easy way to do that. Far easier than trying to develop project players late in the draft like Giannis or getting big time free agents that only 2 franchises can actually get reliably"
Yurpppie.  There wasn’t a pick up game in this country for a few months where there wasn’t at least one dude doing the John Wall dance after making a bucket
honorable mentions: John Wall RIPPPP
There’s a John Wall song. Forget by who though
[Wojnarowski] The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to a trade with the Houston Rockets that will send Kyrie Irving to Houston in exchange for John Wall. Additional details still to come.
"Being the least efficient volume scorer in the NBA isn’t something to wear with pride. Out of players to take at least 15 FGA/G last season, only John Wall (who hadn’t played in 2 years) was less efficient than Westbrook. And Westbrook’s efficiency got worse come playoff time."
"How is this win-win? John Wall is washed. They might as well just cut Kyrie, right?"
John Wall prolly
John wall and Russel Westbrook have entered the chat. Weren’t AD and kawhi supermax eligible too before they forced their ways out?
Rockets have nets picks for the next forever. No way they bail the nets out by giving them John wall.
"5 all star selections the fun spot with a variety of career trajectories  Made it: Reggie Miller, Pistol Pete, Sam Jones, Bob McAdoo, David Thompson  Probably will make it: Tim Hardaway, Chauncey Billups, Chris Webber  Players still very likely to get more selections: Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Not making it: John Wall, Al Horford, Rudy LaRusso  Third options on important teams: Klay Thompson, Kevin Love  and several 60s/ABA guys"
Net's are soo far into the Lux Tax that getting Kyrie off the Books will actually save them 100M for this year alone.. No way ownership takes on the John Wall contract with Luxury Tax for 2 years will cost them over 200M. That's 1/5th of a Billion Dollars for John Fucking Wall for 2 seasons.  EDIT: IF KD TELLS OWNERSHIP TO DO IT THEY FUCKING WILL THOUGH LULZ
"Kyrie for John Wall, Nets get a replacement, Kyrie immediately retires saving Houston money, win/win"
John Wall did it better
When has John Wall ever got in trouble for gang shit while he was in the NBA?
"John Wall, Andrew Wiggins, D-Lo, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Kristaps, Kevin Love...  It might be more rare to get dramatically better after getting a max contract than it is to stay exactly the same (or worse, due to injury, lack of motivation, or age-related decline)."
"Fred Van Vleet, Malcolm Brogdon, both Bogdanovics, Lonzo, Scary Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes.  All very high character good players who can be on the floor at the highest levels of the playoffs without being a liability who were available on the market as non-max players.  I'd rather overpay them a bit and trade away a questionable guy with better talent and not max Ben Simmons/D-Lo/Wiggins/John Wall."
"I think a part of it motor too, he seems to focus on keeping his game smooth and under control which isn’t a bad thing but he could be like John wall hs mixtape crazy and pull it off."
"Nah we wouldn't do it just for the fact that it helps a division and total rival. If Kyrie could retire after being traded, could a John wall trade work?"
Trade for John Wall. A legit win for everyone.
Harden furiously asking for John Wall now
"Ben is way, way over rated. I seriously hope he goes to Sacramento. Cuz no contender is gona give up an actually valuable asset for him.   Im not a fan of CJ McCollum, but I absolutly would NOT trade him for Ben. If Ben was 27 or 28 this wouldn't even be a discussion. His value is in his age.   He can play defense, but he's an offensive liability. He's a max player, who can't play on the 4th quarter. Well he can't play in the last 4 min at least.    Would you trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons right now? FUCK NO. Truth is the fact you'd have to think about that is sad.   Ben's getting paid like KD, Steph, AD, Dame, etc., but he's no where near those guys in actual ability and skill level.   The fact he's doing this, cuz he's in his feelings, is crazy to me. I know it's not easy to handle being in Philly, but that's why he gets paid more than God. I'm not saying the money makes it ok to treat him like shit, but no one has said or done anything crazy in reality. No one has openly disrespected or called him names, in public or in the media.   Everybody's walking on egg shells and he's somehow still offended. It surprised the fuck out of me.   Joel didn't go Gilbert Arenas and pull a gun on him, Doc didn't go Mike Singeltary and call him a loser, Jimmy didn't say anything bad about Ben on his way out. I mean Morrey and Doc, but more so Brand and Brown before that, have built the team around him. They've done everything possible to put him a position to be successful.   He chokes it away, every year, and blames everyone but himself. Like dude you can go thru, and watch his performance in last year's playoffs.   He choked in the 4th quarter of EVERY.SINGLE.GAME vs ATL. He was fucking terrible. I think he had 4 points total for the 4th quarter in that series, and it went like 5 or 6 games, I'm not sure.  Doc and Joel haven't handled this the best, but at the same time, it's no where near as bad as some other coaches, GM's and/or reporters and fans, have been towards other players. And he's in Philly, they fucking boo'd Santa.   I swear this situation is so fucking bizarre. They hurt his feelings cuz he's, single handedly, cost them 2 playoff series' in 3 years now.   You can say the bubble fucked every one up, but last year, without a doubt is on him.   You can argue that if he was a halfway decent offensive player, Philly beats Toronto in '19, and that series doesn't come down to Khawi's buzzer beater.   He's a Tier 2 player, being paid Tier 1A money.   I bet he ends up back in Philly cuz aight no one giving up shit for a point guard, who's owed $150,000,000, and can't shoot. Lmfao he's the most expensive ""hustle and heart"" guy ever. Funny thing is, between last year's playoffs and this off-season, he's proven he has neither.    But what I wana see is how he's gona respond now that it's clear no other GM, or team in general, believes he has any real value. I mean fucking John Wall is on the trading block and Houston isn't willing to part with the corpse of Wall for Simmons. No one masse a real offer for you, and that's gotta hurt a lil.    If I'm Ben, I feel worse now than I did before. But I'll dry my tears with my super max bonus I guess..."
Now Morey needs to wait to see how John Wall plays before inevitably accepting the deal
Harden did it masterfully last year. I still remember that lazy ass pass to John wall
Since the Rockets have a good understanding with John Wall and Westbrook just asked out I’m certain they say no.
john wall trade incoming
"AD remains the most unimpressive first option for a ""star"" in the current NBA and probably in the history of the NBA. Of the top 11 players, he is clearly the worst first option. Even after that, Butler, PG, Russ, Beal, CP3, Dwight, Melo (lol even Melo), Beal, Donavon Mitchell,  Kyle Lowry, Jason Tatum, Demar Derozan, Trae Young, Devin Booker and John Wall have had more success than AD as the first option.  It's fucking ridiculous that I can name 25 players with better success as a first option than a ""TOP 75"" player ever"
That’s what happens when amateurs try it. They should trade with the Rockets for veteran tank commander John Wall
"i would still say no matter what we could’ve gotten way more for such a great player, but i just see people say they should’ve got levert or simmons or whatever and i don’t see it lmao. if we get simmons we end up like the spurs we’re the last 2-3 years. a good player who won’t lead us to or through the playoffs, and then we’re too good to get a  top pick. not to mention we’re paying him and john wall max contracts. if we trade for levert, we likely won’t end up with kpj AND jalen green as well, and we’re stuck w a 27 year old who won’t take us anywhere but won’t get us a top pick, and we’re paying him 17th l a year. i think getting the picks and rebuilding was the smartest thing to do.  as for wall idek man i feel like we just have to pray a team that’s all in underperforms and is willing to take him for some expiring deals or whatever. idk what to do w him but i hope we trade him and get off hsi contract"
s/o to Austin Rivers and John Wall high school mixtapes. Would've thought them two were the future of the league (Wall kinda was for a little bit)
"I genuinely believe that Simmons should just stop training or put in minimal effort such that he's unplayable, and retire at the end of his contract. He'll basically become a John Wall/AL Horford type contract except he can just choose to stop trying, lose some fitness, and retire. After this season of sitting out the whole year, he will have basically no trade value anyway.    $200mil in lifetime earnings is plenty enough, and you're clearly not a competitive guy. Just go live in LA like you've always wanted in Hidden Hills and enjoy investments and retirement."
"You guys were almost ready to take John wall at 40M per year, nothing would surprise me anymore."
The team is the one that is sitting John Wall. I’m sure John would be willing to play if he was asked to. Rich Paul is either dishonest or ignorant.
"Not only that, but Houston traded Westbrook for John Wall at the end of the season, and ultimately Harden got unhappy. He requests a trade and gets traded to the Nets in a big trade that also included the Pacers, who acquired LeVert. And because of that trade, LeVert’s life was saved."
"Gotcha, I love watching John Wall play, but hardly seeing him play much in the last 5 years makes me wonder if he’ll be around for another 5 years"
"If this was 2001 he'd be out there. It's just that teams are smarter nowadays. John Wall could go out there, get his usual 18 and 8 and the Rockets PR department make a sad campaign for his allstar candidacy. Teams won't fall for that anymore.  So instead, the Rockets guarantee they'll be bottom 4 and keep his trade value intact.  I get it, it's not high but there's no such thing as an untradeable contract and by sitting and simply staying healthy he's more valuable than actually playing and putting empty stats on a terrible team."
"This is kinda sad, John Wall used to be so good"
He wants a John Wall in Houston deal.
I’d  say John Wall both loves and hates that contract.
Lebron once hit 22 mph with the ball in his hands  I was an allstate sprinter in california and if i had a radar on me during a race.  It'd be a 22 mph maybe it'd tick to 23 for a split  second here and there. LeBron did that with a ball in his hands.  Crazy!!!!  Faster than John Wall and D-Rose too btw.
When does Adam Silver intervene in the John Wall situation? It’s blatant tanking.
"Gotta love how in the article Rich Paul is like ""it's about getting Ben the help he needs, it's not about money"" and then is like ""but John Wall is getting paid so Ben should get paid"""
"u miss:  5. John Wall can sit and get paid, why Ben cannot?"
And i mean John wall would much rather be playing than sitting at home since athletes only have a certain amount of time.
Straight up John wall for Kyrie?
Wonder if sixers owner is ever gonna step in? If your convinced he’s lying why would you still wanna pay this guy millions? Clearly not a John wall-rockets agreement
"He always rebuttals when fines become involved. Rich Paul is saying the Rockets want Wall not to play and are paying him to stay off the floor, and expect John Wall to remain professional. In the case of Simmons, he's saying why can't the team remain 'professional' and just pay him (without causing him any issues). Seems like a dumb argument."
Does he even have to play basketball? Does John wall play basketball? Just show up twist your ankle get paid. I do think we can see that there is some sort of mental health issue at play but there's also a millennial issue. Maybe they are one and the same. How many new mental health issue has the new generation of kids invented?  I think they forget your still need to be able to do the fucking job your paid to do and treatment is to help you do that. Not give you an excuse not to show up.
John Wall would like to talk to you
"Except CP3 and for all his faults Werstbrook can still really play. John Wall, while im sure a passable rotation player is not better than 30 to 50 other PGs in the NBA.   They can't do what they did with those guys, because he's just not good anymore."
"I can only assume it’s their role, maybe they want the young point guards to develop &amp; the fastest way would be to get them playing time.  Eric Gordon is an incredibly useful player that can pretty much adapt to how the team plays. John Wall is a ball handler &amp; not a great shooter, that’s all I can think of &amp; they probably know some Veteran presence is good for the growth of a team &amp; they just like Eric Gordon."
"I know this is going to be a frivolous exercise because no matter how many sources I cite - wether it’s Reuters, BBC, NPR, New York Times, Wall Street Journal - you will claim that it’s “biased western media”. Which is ironic because China’s “media” is 100% state controlled and you can be jailed for saying things against the CCP. But yeah, the most reputable western media publications definitely “has a clear agenda” and China state run media doesn’t.

"no team tbh. He's in the Westbrook, John Wall, Rondo category. You're never going to win in the playoffs with him on your team. He just doesn't have the shooting and will be a detriment to other stars on the team."
"Because it's not the same situation.   Houston told wall they didn't want him to play so they could develop their kids, even though wall wants to play.  The 76ers actually want Ben to play with the team (as awkward as it would be). Mental ability aside, the John Wall comparison is completely inaccurate because the team in each case is completely opposite of wanting to utilize their player's services that they signed a contract for."
cant imagine a houston russ-john wall trade
Ben Simmons for John Wall... anyone... anyone
"Rich Paul even said it in the article. Says John Wall is physically healthy, not playing, and still getting paid by the Rockets, so why shouldn’t Ben be paid?"
Did you actually look at the source ? There are two tweets in there. One from an ESPN journalist and one from sports Center itself both echoing the same sentiment. Here’s bleacher report if that works better for you..  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/10012407-nba-trade-rumors-john-wall-rockets-mutually-agree-to-find-pg-a-new-home.amp.html
He's looking softer and softer everyday. What is the trade value for a broken punk? Maybe the sixers could get John Wall for him?
"another client of rich paul? john wall. also john wall, not playing right now."
"&gt;	Paul drew a contrast between the situation with Simmons and that of Rockets guard John Wall, another of his clients, who is being paid by Houston while sitting out the season, even though he is healthy enough to play. “John is able to play, but Houston is OK using the (Collective Bargaining Agreement) to pay him not to play,” Paul said. “So which way is it? John is perfectly healthy and ready to play, and it’s OK in the CBA. We are being professional with both instances, but how can it go both ways? John and the Rockets have been professional about their situation, and we are also expecting the same with the 76ers.”  This is some kind of logic reach, Richard."
Why should they trade him tho? They’re playing just as good if not better without him. And at this point the dude is a negative asset.   There’s no straight up player you can match his salary  any teams willing to give up for him unless they take John wall.    Otherwise they have to cut contributing players just to take 2 or more players who may not even gel as welll.      Honestly the best thing for the sixers at this point is just to let him rot.
No that one wasn’t as mutual. But Houston and wall was. https://www.basketballnetwork.net/john-wall-and-the-houston-rockets-agree-to-a-mutual-separation/amp/  What exactly is your point?
John Wall clutch on bag securing
"I mean secure the bag john wall, but damn that will hurt the rockets from being competitive"
fuck john wall
"Not gonna lie that contract is ugly af, no one wants to take that shit. I mean John wall is good but not 40+Mill good."
Remember when John wall was considered a top 5 point guard ? I do
"First, you dumbass, max contracts are not all the same. Max contract amounts vary depending on years of service, so a max for Ja is far less than the max for someone with 10+ years in the league.   Second, there is a supermax that allows for teams to pay eligible players even more than the typical max. Eligibility requires winning an MVP, winning DPOY, or being named to an All-NBA team in addition to years of service. Very, very few players qualify for a supermax.   John Wall got a supermax. He barely qualified by having a career year right before he was extension eligible. It was a bad extension *at the time without benefit of hindsight*. The extension is a colossal albatross now."
"""John wall on the bench outside in the backyard"""
I think it’s as simple as John Wall is not in their longterm plans so unless he performs so well that other teams clamor for him despite his contract or it may be wiser to sit him.  The rockets aren’t a good team yet but they’re young &amp; if they hit on the next few drafts they could have a nice young core that’ll grow together. No one wants their future young star or stars to grow disgruntled &amp; this is the best way to prevent that.
"Sure John Wall at his best could give you more than Mozgoz ever could, but he was also making a lot more money. John Wall at his absolute peak was never worth 47 million lol. There's only a few players where that's even a discussion, and John's never been close to top 10 in the league"
FREE JOHN WALL
John wall playing for a trade might win them games. But there’s no actually chance anyone will trade for him. So it makes zero organizational sense to play him.
"Genuinely can't believe people still think his stock didn't bottom out after he collapsed again in the playoffs lol he shot 33% from the FT line for a whole series. We got offered Buddy Heild and Marvin Bagley this summer lol. You do know you have to match salaries in a trade anyway, we will get players in return for him and whatever you think coaches in the league think he's the best defender in the whole damn league, he has value.  What do you think will happen? We have to start attaching picks to Ben and trading him + Maxey for an expiring John Wall lol? He's not THAT bad. Everyone said this over the summer and we're still in the same place. You think the kings are no longer offering us Buddy Heild or the Timberwovles have made Malik Beasley untouchable?"
"""This could work, you send us John Wall and a wing stopper.""  No, we're sending you John Wall and Wingstop."
Because Stephen Silas is a bad coach.  I gotta assume even the corpse of John Wall would be better for Jalen Greens development then running KPJ at point.
D'lo for John Wall
"“Hello, police? This is Blake Griffin, John Wall is tryna get in the locker room and beat me up! Get down here and save me!”"
"The language was so absolutist (""John Wall will not play for the Houston Rockets this season""), that I don't see how they walk that back."
"One flaw of the nba is how contracts can get in the way of a talented player playing professional basketball somewhere as they deservedly should.  Luol Deng and Chandler Paraons had to basically never play ball again because they were paid too much by bad GM decision.  Now John Wall should be playing anywhere in even a small bench role or anything but he has to waste his talents sitting this year out.    Idk if this part of the business will ever truly change but on principle, I wish contracts didn’t act as ball and chain and players could be freed without doing what they obviously won’t, turn down the money they’re already guaranteed.  Oh well, tiny violin for the multi millionaires I guess."
"I thought it was a mutual decision about him not playing according to the reports earlier in the season.  I interpreted it as John Wall being unwilling to come off the bench.  But if that's not the case, then I tend to agree that playing Wall would be the best chance to move him. It reminds me when the Wizards were able to trade Gilbert Arenas in 2010 when he was coming off the bench."
Fresh out of that. How about one slightly-used John Wall?
I dont see why the Lakers can't give up Westbrook and a second round pick for a swap for John Wall. They pretty much similar contract.  Rockets get Westbrook back and maybe he can mentor some of their PGs.
"Is John Wall the current generation's Gilbert Arenas?  He earnt a hell of a contract, and then injuries keeps him from slaying?"
Not if the rockets hold out on playing John Wall as well lol
"You really don’t understand moral philosophy, do you? You’re so stuck on thinking about this from a literal perspective, which is not what I’ve been arguing.  I understand the economics behind how the NBA works. I understand *why* John Wall gets paid what he does. I understand that, in reality, work is not directly correlated with income. I’m not disagreeing or arguing with any of this. This is all basic economics and reality.  My original comment is not, nor are any of my subsequent comments, about the economics behind why John Wall is paid so lavishly.  My argument is about what moral philosophy warrants a person making hundreds of millions of dollars. Under what ethical framework does a person *deserve* to make hundreds of millions? I personally don’t subscribe to any such moral philosophy, hence my original statement: no one deserves to make millions of dollars. I am making a normative claim, *not* a descriptive claim as you keep arguing."
There is no team in the league where trading away 40M in contracts to add John Wall makes them a contender.
Philly gonna get a return of John Wall and 3 drum sticks at this rate
The only team that would trade for John Wall is one that would do it for the picks you attach to John Wall. There's no way the rockets will give up picks in a trade so I would be absolutely shocked if John Wall gets traded on this contract.
Why don't they just play him  the contract is still going to be there and no one wants him at that contract  a buy out probably won't happen unless john wall gives back at least 50% of the salary and another team is willing to give him that half which doesn't even seem like a good value either for any team.
I’ve never been more sure of anything as I am that John Wall fucking *loves* that contract.
Enforcer John Wall protecting Jalen Green from opposing players
is this another case of ben simmons? is john wall a diva?
John Wall isn’t playing because the Rockets think he’s *too* good and would win too many games for their tank.
"Well, John Wall doesn't play at all."
&gt;People deserve a cut of the money they generate  Why? Because it’s “fair”?  John Wall happened to win the genetic lottery which makes him entitled to millions of dollars? Nah.
&gt;they … deserves those contracts  Insane. No one deserves to make millions of dollars a year. People work far harder than Wall for literal dollars per day all over the world.  John Wall was lucky enough to be born in a society that places great value on his particular skills. That’s it.
Not sure if John Wall agrees with that
"John Wall is a healthy player on a max contract that doesn't fit the timeline of the Houston Rockets and so he is being sat, partially for tanking reasons and partially because they prefer to play their younger players in that position.  Yet the reason he is being sat and not traded is because his contract is rising too high compared to his decline.  It's a dangerous precedent for exactly as it reads I guess. The NBA wants its highest paid players to play, because that's good for the entertainment value of the game in general.   Imagine if Giannis tweaked his ACL tomorrow and didn't fully recover. He has a 50m+ player option in 2025. What kind of player would he be at that point? Who is going to take that trade? So their options are to buy out his remaining 200m, or sit him for multiple years to develop younger guys and hope he can be salary filler later on (so you don't play him to avoid injury, just like john wall).  Thats terrible for the game. You have to look beyond John Wall himself. He is still one of the best players on the rockets by resume and league status. Recognizable names on the lineups matters to casuals tuning in and league ratings."
I don't think John Wall will endanger the tank
Bro John Wall is getting 40 million to not even play. Wiggins isn't even close to the worst contract in the league.
John Wall is a dumbass. He should have played this season instead of pretending that sitting out is a good choice. He play good for what we expected last year. Why didn't carry this over one more season? He already missed 2 years!
Last year someone debated with me that Russell Westbrook’s contract was the worst in the league including John Wall. I wonder how they’re doing right now…
"I love Van Gundy (I’m all in on abolishing the take foul) but he seemed to get really lost while trying to express how upset he was about Wall being made to sit out.  He started out talking about a “dangerous precedent”. But he didn’t really explain why it was “dangerous”. It’s a team and a player not able to work out a buy-out, and the rockets are trying to squeeze him on the buyout by not playing him. Whether he plays or not on a tanking team is truly irrelevant, and doesn’t hurt the product at all.  Dangerous is an All-NBA level guy like Ben Simmons with 4 years on his contract, in his prime, pretending to be injured, sitting out to try to force a trade, then abusing the mental health system to try to keep sitting out while not losing game checks.  He then proceeded to say that John Wall was one of the best players on the team. I don’t even know if rockets fans would agree with that. They probably think he is the exact same level as Tate and that they would be better off trying to develop a younger dude as a piece and find a place for him in their system and rotations than trying to squeeze production out of a very injury prone player who may make demands on playing time, role, etc. based on his contract size and past production rather than what he can provide going forward."
So John Wall FLEXED THE WHOLE LEAGUE. He’s getting paid too much to play… 😂
Do John Wall for Ben Simmons. I want chaos
Congrats to John Wall on winning the lottery.
"John wall for Dlo, does that make the twolves better??"
Lol John Wall is completely finessing the NBA out of so much money while hardly ever even playing games
Maybe John Wall enjoys basketball?
"John Wall for Russell Westbrook....  what a joke of a trade. Russ paid much better dividends than John Wall did.  Is John Wall glue factory health wise @ this point in his career too??? Salary based 100% on past glory, not future ROI."
"True. I'm a bit surprised we've never heard from John Wall during all of this, which tends to make me think there's some truth to u/TuqiDuque12's comment. Maybe Wall knows he doesn't really have it anymore, and he really is content.  If he really wanted to play basketball, I would think he has a pretty strong case that a team shouldn't be able to sit their best player against his will just so they can lose games. It's a horrible look for the league to have players sitting our entirely like this, and Wall calling attention to that would put lots of pressure on lots of people. Might well be able to get Silver to intervene and force a trade."
"Their owner is a known frugal asshole, so working with John Wall (or rather just not treating him like Ben Simmons) helps the organization's reputation in the future"
"John Wall has it fucking made.  Don't even have to play games, just get paid megabucks to practice and take it easy."
The rise and fall of John Wall has been equally fascinating and sad to see.
"Kat for Wood + John Wall, Nets Pick."
Yeah but if he’s being compared to zero-minutes John Wall then he’s more valuable even at that price.
I've always said John Wall is more athletic Stephon Marbury. He'll be in China when this is over too.
I’m sure teams are lining up for their chance to pay John Wall 47 mil next year
isaiah thomas is the prime example of being done dirty. john wall got his max and doesn't have the obligation of a guy like simmons to fulfill his contract or the expectation of klay thompson to come back on the court.
Free John Wall.
I saw John Wall was at the Duke vs Kentuky game at MSG. Seems like he's just chilling tbh
That isn’t his responsibility. John Wall can choose how much he values money vs playing time
John “Rob Manfred” Wall
Ever seen John Wall play offball? It might be worse than Westbrook
"John wall is great if you're not paying him a max contract.   He was trying to do too much on the Rockets last year because they had 0 other talent. If you surround him with a good team, he could be a great 3rd/4th option.  His value right now is around $10 mil/year and anything less is a steal imo."
John wall is done... he has no athleticism left and his playstyle is isolating into dumbass shots that he shoots at a terrible rate. And if he can't drive his playmaking is gone too.
John Wall and Dennis Schroeder feels about right.
"Fuck me, this one hurts. I used to love John Wall, what the fuck happened to him? Injuries surely?"
It’s gotta be John Wall and another guard
John wall and anyone making ~$5 million probably
Your curious if John wall watches nba?
"Yeah, like we all know John Wall isn’t worth the contract he has, but if he isn’t even given the chance to play and showcase himself then his value as a player is going to pretty much be  non existent"
Rockets said you can come back if you come off the bench but your ego is too big. You're free John Wall but you don't want to take it.
We ain’t moving Jrue to the 2 for the corpse of John Wall
i assume it would look like john wall playing basketball. what a weird thing to say
Free John Wall
Words I never thought I'd utter in my life: john wall looks slow now
[Enes Kanter seeing John Wall being guarded by an Asian man and tweeting 'FreeMe'](https://giphy.com/gifs/drooling-xS2v1vFvOHnoI)
John Wall said he doesn't wanna come off the bench and he'd def be a backup PG on the Bucks
They're gonna be even better once they get John wall
Wall makes too much lol we'd have to send out more players to even make the trade work. John Wall is easily the hardest contract to trade in the league
I'm 24 and distinctly remember playing basketball in 5th grade and having to deal with a few guys doing the John Wall Dance after every shot lol
John Wall on the Bucks?  Would he hurt their spacing?
I too can make John Wall look like a Hall of Fame.
"Sounds like an Al Horford, John Wall agreement"
"Is John Wall not considered a vet? He’s been with the team all the time and engaged with the rest of the players, he just hasn’t been playing actual games."
"i watched the cavs obliterate lowry year after year   you guys make one run and act like the whole era was a success lol   2015  John Wall vs Toronto: 17/12/4   Lowry vs WAS: 12/5/4   4 game sweep for Wizards  2016   game 4 and 5, Bismack Biyombo turns into Wilt Chamberlain and gets 40 rebounds and Lowry turns in two good performances. the other 4 games are absolute bend overs and Lowry saves his series average with 23 points in the 2nd half of a 25 point blowout   2017   Lowry has an elbow injury that hurts him and limits him to two games. plays good 1st half of game 1 and 2, but only has 10 second half points in the entire series, which the Cavs sweep  2018  Round 1 the Raptors win in 4 games and Lowry has a respectable 17/12 line, but Wall is at 26/11/5/ and 4.6 stocks a game. would like to hear how he’s better than Wall  round 2 vs Cavs, he has 0 points in the 4th quarter of CLE’s game 1, 1-point win. game 2 he starts out on fire, and then halftime rolls around and he scored 3 points in the second half and the cavs turn on the burners and win by 20   game 3 he has a great game.   game 4 he has 5 points and the Cavs eliminate them in a 30-point dress down   2019   he averaged 12/7 through the first two rounds, but luckily he has a real #1 and he is able to survive through Orlando and the Sixers. legit winning player against milwaukee and golden state   2020   3rd best guard against Brooklyn and then got knocked out against Boston    dude has been bad more often then he has been good"
"&gt; Never heard of him, until he was really peaking at Washington  Lmao that's shocking if true, he was the biggest player in the world in HS, was expected to go #1 right outta high school but opted to go to college. At UK he was considered the best in the NCAA, set the single game assists record, and was considered Callipari's best ever at the time, pre AD. Went #1 overall in the draft, he and Rose were the most hyped college prospects since at least Dwight, maybe since LeBron. Wall was probably rightful ROTY over Blake, who was in his sophomore season. Then the lockout happened and Wall got hurt and it took a while for him to bounce back and ""really peak at Washington"".  ""Do the John Wall"" peaked at 76 on the billboard charts, while Wall was still in college, and the John Wall dance was famously done by everyone from Magic Johnson to Jon Stewart before he ever suited up in the NBA."
He doesn't have to ask permission to play. He can come off the bench. John Wall is sitting unless he starts.
It's not they won't play Wall over EG or DJ. John Wall doesn't want to come off the bench.   KPJ is developing and has played very well at Point Guard the last two games. Wall starting over KPJ right now would directly fuck over his development.
Bro what? Are you 15? John wall was huge in college was well known in the nba also.
all these young nba players are roughly my age (19-22). i promise you john wall was fucking massive in the late 2000s/early 2010s
I think we're severely underrating wall. Wood has good looked for the last couple of games but even this version of john wall is a lot better than wood imo
"It's even weirder and funnier that a team refuses to play John Wall but looks at DJ Augustine and Eric Gordon and says ""yeah guys go out there and chuck as many shots as you want"". Then of course the Theis/Sengun situation."
"And Wall isn't? I think people forget just how huge he was supposed to be coming out of college. ""Do The John Wall"" is a meme sure but it was big, he was a household name and he looked like he could been an MVP"
"I’m all for freeing John Wall, but that first clip looks like he was being defended by an r/nba poster"
"Washed or not, John Wall is still the 2nd best player on that team"
benching Wall doesn't exactly affect the win column. Nobody in Houston is going to the game because John Wall is playing.
"[[Charania] Sources: Rockets five-time All-Star John Wall will continue to sit games after he told team officials his desire is to play, start games and compete to maintain role. Houston wants Wall to come off the bench.](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1465042575052705800)  #[Full Story: The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2983329/2021/11/28/john-wall-wants-to-return-to-play-and-start-the-rockets-want-him-to-come-off-the-bench-what-are-their-options/)"
"Avery Bradley was #1 above John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins in high school. Looked almost never gonna make the league at Texas. But he still out here, making NBA paychecks.   Kevin Porter Jr for the Rockets comes to mind as well.   There's a lot of these actually"
"&gt; nobody is saying that this team isn't better than last years, but you are acting like Russ came and ruined everything when he arguably is the reason you guys have a second life after your first playoff entry in years and getting traded. It was nothing but positive and yall act like he's the worst thing to ever happen. You traded him for John wall who wouldn't have even played most likely lol. Wizards fans are so ungrateful holy fuc.  By your response I know you didn't read that part. Im not going to argue with someone without reading comprehension that doesn't make sense to me. Have a good day. Happy for the Wizards success."
"Nobody is a stan. Im not even a big Russ guy but he diff upgraded your team and everyone on the squad gained something from being there. Ofc you are better you went from having zero depth and relying on rookies and Bertans to having the most depth in the league. Nobody is saying that this team isn't better than last years, but you are acting like Russ came and ruined everything when he arguably is the reason you guys have a second life after your first playoff entry in years and getting traded. It was nothing but positive and yall act like he's the worst thing to ever happen. You traded him for John wall who wouldn't have even played most likely lol. Wizards fans are so ungrateful holy fuc."
"2014-2017 he wasn’t good  maybe bc he only played 2 games against the cavs in 2017 when the Cavs swept them?  and then he only averaged 18+ in two series from 2017-2021  i think he’s a fine player, but in the playoffs, his contemporaries are/were steph, kyrie (who has struggled since 2016), dame, john wall, isaiah thomas, playoff Rondo etc.  just a lot of dudes who were putting up a ton of mind-blowing performances and Lowry definitely felt like he was in the bottom half of starting point guards"
"Yeah I agree with you. This whole story is weird to me and I feel like a bunch of people are “falling for it”. Where were all of the “John Wall lives and breathes basketball” comments when the story was out that it was a mutual decision to sit Wall because he wanted to be on a contender.  To me, this reeks of Rich Paul creating this whole scenario, realizing he has zero value, and now he has to backtrack and get John to play because he forgot that’s you can’t trade a guy that people have seen play only 30 games in 3 calendar years."
Thats the hard part. Lakers were dumb to take on that contract but anything would be good at this point. I even think ben simmons or john wall would be good. Ben just for defensive purposes.
Westbrook for John Wall
Westbrook for Simmons and AD for Harden.     The rest of the team for John Wall.
John Wall Effect 😤😤😤
This rockets team is not as bad most of y’all was saying it was and with john wall coming back to the team soon it would not surprise me if they go on a little winning streak along the way
[John Wall when he sees the Rockets on a 2-game win streak](https://i.imgur.com/3YIb6LW.gif)
John Wall so eager to come back now that the Rockets are on a 2-game win streak
Remember when the Rockets gave up a net of one first rounder to turn Chris Paul into John Wall?
"Give him Derrick Rose's contract, and every contender would want him. At $45 million a year, though...it is just impossible for nearly any contender to fit that on their roster without dropping enough players that they wouldn't have a complete team.  The one exception being maybe the Clippers? They have a handful of medium-sized bad contracts that could be pooled together. If John Wall comes back and shows he can still play 25 mins a game at a decently high level, maybe a Bledsoe/Kennard/filler for Wall swap comes into play."
Give Lakers john wall and send westbrook somewhere else lmao
"Except even with John Wall they're guaranteed a top pick outside of dropping, which could happen to a 0-82 team."
"I need to see more of John Wall. Remember, before he went down he was basically the best defensive guard in the league. Now I'm not saying he'll ever be that again, but he is a different player from Westbrook."
I'd say it's a little different because Simmons is welcome to play but he's throwing a tantrum. John Wall just wants to play ( and could still contribute) but yall aren't letting him
I think you’re overstating the benefits of playing John Wall
"They can just replace DJ Augustin’s minutes with John Wall minutes and he’ll end up playing 8 minutes a game.   It’s not like the Rockets are going to, somehow, be forced to play Wall significant minutes if they don’t want to."
John wall isn’t moving the needle that much because he’s played like 72 games since the 18-19 season started. I feel like it’s a win-win situation because the rockets get wall to mentor and provide guidance to their younger guys and wall gets a chance to shake some rust off and maybe audition for a contender if his contract situation can get sorted out. I feel like you can tank to get talented players but you need to actually develop them instead of sucking so much you just collect a ton of talent
John Wall doesn't want to give up money in a contract buyout. But if he's healthy and wants to play he should be given mins.
"supposedly John wall lives and breathes basketball.  has 4 TVs in his living room tuned to any kind of ball from high school to nba, mens, women, you name it."
does adding john wall make the rockets better? maybe a little but not enough to matter at this point. I'm pretty sure he really just wants to play so might as well play him.
John wall can't stand watching the Rockets anymore.
IWestbrook ain’t shooter but John Wall sure as shit isn’t a shooter either lmao
"Yeah outside of Houston, Detroit, and Orlando, which team really isn’t competitive in some way? With or without John Wall, Houston will be a bottom 3 team."
"Yeah, it’s prolly good but John Wall last year was hard to watch.  There was a lot of chucking  I really hope he takes a different approach this time"
"Houston Rockets guard John Wall has expressed his hopes to the organization that he can resume playing for the team in the near future, sources tell ESPN. Story soon.  Hmm"
"Eh, the new lottery odds made it that there really is no benefit to be the worst team in the league. John Wall is going to make them better but not much. Get wall playing so he can showcase his talent and a team could want to pick him up, get the young guards to have to compete for minutes (that will make them better) and ur sill going to have basically the same odds as before."
Nobody is sending back assets or trading for John wall lol
"They will still get to play. Who would you rather get minutes, dj augustin or John wall? It makes no sense  that the rockets won’t play wall but will play Eric Gordon and augustin."
John Wall  already stinks and his contract dosent end until 2023 when he’s 33 years old. He is getting the veterans minimum if he even gets another NBA contract.
John Wall still a top 20 pg in this league.  If his contract wasn't so bad he would have decent value.
"John Wall is not going to kill their tank, they’ll still be terrible but at least they’ll have an actual PG who can make plays"
Trade Westbrook for John Wall
Honest to god trade WB for John Wall and I legitimately think you upgrade both the Rockets player development and the Lakers flow
"&gt; it's absolutely wild how deranged his presidency made American liberals. He broke the left  …  &gt; His position was entirely symbolic. He was never making actual, behind the scenes geopolitical decisions.  You’re saying it’s okay the dude handed his daughter’s husband an “entirely symbolic” position that paid between $80,000-$120,000? AND that the *LEFT* is broken and deranged?  It would be one thing if it was benching Kushner from a contract where he couldn’t say “you’re FIRED” ala the John Wall - Houston situation, but like.. kicking symbolic people out was his shtick, he led the revolving door administration. Kushy just hung out with bonesaw bin Salman and did his thing.

"People mean low BBall IQ, not actual IQ, and yes he did have it. There is no other explanation for that play where he runs back on defense when John Wall had the ball. He wasn't paying attention to the game or aware of his surroundings. That's low BBall IQ."
"Nobody's taking Westbrook. Even for John Wall, the Rockets would rather tank and give their young guys minutes over Westbrook."
You dont remember the and 1 fade over john wall?
He hit one over John Wall in his iconic shrug game in 2018 and got the and-1. Never did it since lol.
how about john wall + tobias harris + khris middleton?
would lebron + AD + john wall be a superteam?
John Wall doesn't sell tickets  Anthony Davis sells tickets  follow the money lol  NBA is an entertainment
"A lot of people are missing your main point, which is that it's unusual for an undersized small guard type player to go 1st overall.  Iverson was the first really since John Lucas 20 years before him, and since him really only 3 others, D-Rose, Kyrie and John Wall.  Iverson was a special player, you could just tell watching him play he was different, he was so fast and he could get to the rim and finish even at his size. He was a pure scorer and his instincts on defense got him a lot of steals.   That was also a weird draft as there were not a lot of can't miss prospects at the time. Of course looking back it's easy to spot Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, and Ray Allen but at the time none of them were considered candidates for #1 overall.  Probably Marcus Camby would have gone #1 overall if it was anyone besides the Sixers picking first."
"Yeah, lots of young guys on your team. Hopefully they start to mesh better in a few years.  Also, John Wall doing nothing is ridiculous."
John Wall   HM: KPJ (even though he still has star potential)
"The way most of y’all talk about him, John Wall. I actually watched bro last season. He’s ass."
"Not a chance. Russ is still almost worth his price. Simmons kinda has to get traded for an equally overvalued contract. John Wall is the only one that really comes to mind, but I doubt the 76ers wanna open that can of worms"
I wouldn't wanna give up Kennard either. I'd want John wall but he just makes way too much.
"Wall is not better than Russ, wall is not even half the player he was, give me a durable shot chucking Russ over a broken down john wall anyday"

You're missing my point though. I agree that Wall knows he doesn't have it anymore. But it still sucks to not have it. That's why I think it sucks to be John Wall right now. His dream was to still have it and now he doesn't have it and his dreams are dashed. Which is a horrible feeling for anyone.
"this exactly, they take out the spirit of pride and game. OF course its a business and that takes precedent. jut like Caruso put it, he wanted to stay with lakers and enjoyed all aspects but you have a small window of opportunity to make the cash and you should take it.    its why blake and guys who have made enough can and will give up 1-5 million. While people think when you make 50 milllion you don't care, a million is always a million and hte opportunity cost o it as an investment or buying power doesnt go away, you just can eat it, but the feeling of losing that is all the same.    john wall probably wants to play, is itchcing to compete and has a chip on his shoulder. HIs money is guaranteed he wouldn't have done two excruciating surgeries and slow rehab to get tothis level because he 'has to' at this point the elements of pride, competitiveness,and just enjoyment o playing takes precedent.       Likewise with Melo. He doesn't need more money and he plays for the minimum now yearly, but the guy wants to hoop and there is no better atmosphere, energy, or adrenaline than a stadium filled in the nba."
John Wall is still in the NBA?
"DC still loves John Wall, it’s a damn shame about all his injuries"
"...hmmm...  you know how many exciting layup attempts John Wall missed? and how many juke-move circus shot attempts, that Bradley Beal has missed? and multitudes of big-moment shots Gilbert missed? **Those misses did not change how those plays and those moves were still exciting to us fans who cannot do that when we are out on the court playing.**  *I think JJ is just caping for the demise of the 3pt shot*... JJ had no 2ptr game, so of course he's going to be critical of players who exhilarate fans in ways that he cannot do it...  JJ realizes that the past two playoffs have featured Conference Finals &amp; especially NBA Finals, where teams ***won*** by going to the 3pt shot *less* and going to the midrange game far more."
John Wall is being paid. Infact the people losing money are the Rockets
Cause no one pays to see John Wall play anymore. AD is a much bigger ticket seller.
Because no fans care about John Wall
"When Tucker, Boogie, Wall and John Lucas put the fear of God into his heart &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"
"Hopefully John Wall &amp; Boogie, 2 guys who have had off court issues can help him too"
john wall.   i  remember being a kid and my friends and i vibing to [this](https://youtu.be/meYIbAt2iaQ) song.
&gt; we have no idea how beal would do with that much off ball play  sorry but you clearly have no idea how versatile of a scorer beal is.  He spent his first 6 years playing off ball next to John Wall and is doing it now with Westbrook.  &gt;plus why would they run a curry beal klay draymond wiseman lineup  lol because it would ruin the league.  &gt;wiggins in the better for for the warriors  no.  just no my dude.
"The sexiest play I can think of is splitting a hard hedge off a high screen and roll, going downhill full speed , and making a 360 degree jelly layup over a weak side help defender. I feel like John Wall has maybe done this? Jamal Murray?  The way Jordan moved around the court was a thing of beauty as well. His fluidity and body control were second to none."
"For comparison, John Wall missed it by 1.4ppg and has a 54% TS."
"Yeah, Wiggs doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective for them.  Beal is a great shooter but does not defend well. Also as we saw after John Wall went down, Beal is a much better player with the ball in his hands and a higher usage %.  Wiggins seems to be the opposite. He plays worse with a higher usage % and the ball in his hands more often.  If this trade happened I actually do not like it for either team lol. Wiggins goes back to being forced into a #1 guy role that he cant handle and Beal is relegated to the third man role when Klay comes back but if Klay and Curry are cooking on offence then Beal is pretty bad out there imo because he wont defend well and with Klay and Curry hot they don't need Beal level player space to be added."
kd had the longest time off for an achilles injury besides John wall. Legit 6-7 months more than the average NBA player. Covid helped him in this regard.
"Why isn't John Wall playing? He was out last game too, no?"
Bruh harden has played 3 games with the nets and is 2-1. Also the games he played with the rockets had many players (including John wall) out missing games due to covid etc. You very obviously do not watch games.
"You deleted your other message so I’ll say it here. Yes, John Wall is also hurt."
John Wall didn’t get drafted till 2010
Look at the vote breakdown during those years.    KD finished around 7-9 each year.    Players like John Wall Paul George Joel Embiid Jokic and Damian Lillard all finished above him. And he finished slightly above Demar DeRozan.
"Paul Pierce was stabbed 17x in the chest and back but still came back and played that season.  He also won Finals MVP beating LeBron, peak John Wall, 80% Kobe Bryant   But will always be remembered for needing a wheelchair because he pooped  unexpectedly"
curry was playing his 6th game in 2 years because his team sat him out with minor injuries because they didn't want him to play so they could tank. John Wall is coming off of a ruptured Achilles and infection. how the fuck are you comparing the two lmao  &amp;#x200B;  warriors fans are total clowns sometimes. you NEED these 8 games to make it seem like Curry had less help than Harden lmfao
We are down to gift you guys Eric Gordon and John Wall.
Looked up some records vs recent stars:  10-0 vs Dipo  22-4 vs Hayward 22-5 vs CJ McCollum 12-2 vs John wall
"Simmons/wood/tate/brown isn't a bad core to rebuild around. John wall could have been traded during the off season after he raises his value. Let Gordon and pj leave too. Boom, easy rebuild."
Did he say this about KD? I know for a fact he said this about John Wall because Wall tore the Achilles in his non-jumping leg?
"lol exactly dude, harden was straight up honest. if the truth made those guys feel disrespected, sorry for them. But what has John Wall or Cousins ever done to warrant championship caliber respect? Harden called it straight, those dudes are not good enough to win the western conference. They can get offended but doesn’t mean it’s not true."
"Realistically though, the rockets wouldn’t beat the lakers or the clippers. Even with Wood playing well and John Wall on the team. Playoff team, for sure, but not good enough to get the conference final IMO"
Its probably john wall or whoever the rockets best player is.
Hmm how's the performance of john wall and demarcus cousins recently?
"""Were just not good enough. Obviously Chemisty, talent wise. Just... everything. It was clear these last few games. From the begging of the games. ""  Yeah Wood playing like a borderline all star and John Wall coming back healthy doesnt have enough talent or chemistry.  If I was his teammate at the point, I would not like somebody publicly talking shit about me."
"Lol wait what.   To even pretend like Zion isn’t that on that tier is crazy. And John Wall shouldn’t even be in that discussion, I don’t even know why you named him before some like Kyrie"
"lol he literally plays nothing like the last time we seen him  he's relegated to standing by the 3 now  john wall has said he was playing with bone spurs for years before he went down with the achilles tear  it's very possible that blake is still injured, just not to the point where he's gonna make excuses and sit out"
do the john wall
"If the rockets lose oladipo here and John wall/cousins never regain value they have very little value on this team &amp; just a ton of cap space.  They're headed towards a gigantic rebuild, while the nets are set to contend for at least a few years.  If 2/3 of the stars stay, I have a hard time picturing them out the playoffs, even at 36+, on the other hand, I have a really hard time seeing the rockets route to the playoffs"
"I’ve noticed recently that athletes are recovering from ACL injuries way better than they used to. Achilles are tougher, but I’m encouraged seeing KD and John Wall this year. Having two separate injuries and missing two full seasons will make it tough, but Klay doesn’t rely on his explosiveness for offense. I think his defense takes a hit, but he will come back as a good player"
"Boogie and John wall didn’t hold their tongue last week about Harden.  Teammates could say, I don’t know. I have no comment.  Happens all the time.  They instead said, we know what’s going on and we support him."
"I miss Victor Oladipo.I’m glad We got LeVert I loved him on those DLow nets teams but Oladipo will always be my favorite player, can’t wait to him and John wall get bounced out together by Bron in the first round of the playoffs."
1) Aaron Gordon. Let him be your starting 3. He'd be slightly miscast there but they just need him to guard their best guy and attack the rim (he'd have spacing everywhere else)  2) PJ's a 36 year old expiring deal. Boogie's washed and Oladipo is also an expiring looking for either a max contract or to go to Miami. That leaves John Wall who has a mammoth enough contract that you can't really build around.
"1) who could/should the Timberwolves trade for 2) could any trade salvage their season 3) I keep hearing PJ Tucker’s name thrown around since Harden was traded.... why would we think Houston is gonna blow it up and rebuild? Don’t they have John Wall, Boogie, and Oladipo? That sounds like a great big 3... plus they still have Tucker"
"0 shot that gets Beal with 3 years left on his contract.  At the time they weren't done with John Wall and were not an obvious perennial gutter team.  5 mid to late firsts do not fetch an all-star.  These aren't even hope the team crashes and burns in 5 years picks either like the Nets picks.  Also keep in mind they would have almost had to unload the Gordon Hayward contract to match salaries for Beal.  This was coming off his atrocious recovery year, in which he probably had negative value to GMs.  &amp;#x200B;  The most likely moves available to Ainge would be moving one first for a bench piece, or two for a starter.  It's really hard to move a bunch of mid to late firsts for a star player.  It's the ""four quarters aren't equal to a dollar"" sort of thing."
Is John Wall hurt again? I haven't seen anything about him but he's also not playing?
"Idk if the Rockets intend to keep him around, it sounds like they are open to it.  Just don't know what the hell we are ever going to do with John Wall."
They lost this game lmao. I think they have some great players but definitely not underrated as a whole. It was basically the Oladipo show all night with bits of Christian  Wood but even then the majority of his baskets were off of Oladipo dishes. Will look a lot better when John Wall comes back though.
The Rockets have a really strong starting five:  PF: John Wall  SG: Eric Gordon  SF: Oladipa  PF: Tucker  C: Wood  &amp;#x200B;  That team's in remarkably good shape for a re-build.
And what do you do with John Wall a max contract PG/ballhandler? And Ben once again crowding working space for Christian Wood?
Wait John Wall is out already again?
We really need John wall back and for boogie to play less tbh
"Injured guard John Wall yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Christian Wood gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Eric Gordon yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Oladipo hit  locker room door, former NBA great DeSagana Diop hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
John Wall also looks pretty good. There’s a couple guys in football too who have come back and been themselves so maybe the Achilles will go the way of the ACL year where it’s brutal but not permanently damaging
"I would’ve done that sixers trade and found a way to unload John wall. He’s looking like he still has juice, I’m sure a team would throw some assets for him"
"Houston currently has a total of 22 million on the books for for 2023-2024 and literally nothing on the books for 2024-2025 which is the last year of Ben Simmons’ contract where he’s making 40mil. Couldn’t you guys theoretically spend the rest of this year and the following 2 years rebuilding/retooling (ie moves like trading Eric Gordon/pj tucker for any picks you can get hoping John wall plays well and you can get an asset for him in the expiring year like OKC did with Chris Paul, etc) with the timeline being attempting to contend in 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 where you have all the cap space in the world and Ben Simmons would be in his prime at 27 and 28 years old? I mean if you don’t believe in Ben Simmons sure that’s fine I don’t necessarily either but timeline wise I don’t understand how that doesn’t work."
Not being biased at all   John Wall-Oladipo-House-Tucker-Wood  2nd team is prolly  Eric Gordon - Mclemore -Tate -Cousins - Gobert
"&gt;Ben Simmons is more likely going to be prime Westbrook, John wall type of player than Lebron/KD  Well the rockets have next to zero chance of landing a Lebron/KD with the assets they got"
"that's exactly the kind if team this sub hates lol, Ben Simmons is more likely going to be prime Westbrook, John wall type of player than Lebron/KD. They'd be a competitive mediocre team that can't make deep runs but good enough to not get lottery picks.  although, Seeing the direction the rockets are headed,they might not even try to flip oladipo and just let him walk free and save money. It doesn't really look like the owner wants to compete, let alone contend."
The John Wall experience
"&gt; Ben Simmons is far more desirable than 4 picks   They would have been trading for a disgruntled Ben Simmons who didn't want to be traded in the first place, and who clearly didn't want to be part of a rebuild. On top of that, they're stuck with John Wall's nightmare contract for 3 years. What the fuck are the Rockets winning if they're paying wall and Simmons a combined $75mil/year over the next 3 seasons? At expiration, the Rockets would have had Simmons for 2 years, which would have given them a very small window to craft a path to contention. Tearing it down and trading for draft compensation made far more sense than taking the package Philly was offering."
"Not really though. The rumor was only 2 picks. Simmons is a great player, but with John Wall already eating cap, that duo isn’t winning a championship anytime soon. By the time they actually had more flexibility, Ben would likely be gone."
"Oh idk, maybe the 5x All Star, slam dunk champion, John Wall???"
Wood and Simmons are a great fit. Wall is obviously a problem but they aren’t going anywhere with John on the roster so they’d just be waiting till his deal is up to make legitimate moves.
If Simmons was as bad as everyone says then the Rockets would have no trouble doing a mini tank for two years to get more talent to surround Simmons with and get John Wall off the books.
Also a shoutout to John Wall
"No. I don't think Simmons makes sense for the Rockets. Could have worked if they found a third team to take Simmons I guess.   Houston is stuck with John Wall for the next 3 years. Ben Simmons and John Wall won't work well together, which could definitely cause problem in retaining him long term. The rockets are hoping the Nets aren't good after the next couple years of KD/Harden, and banking on that. High risk, High reward for them."
"ah no, i shouldve worded my comment better, i meant that just because he said that its easier to build chemistry when there are good players around him doesnt mean that he didnt think similarly with some former teammates. obviously they had good runs with CP and were buddies with WB last year so im sure he felt similarly with them, but he must not have felt the same with wall since he wanted to leave.   so overall im not saying john wall is bad because i love john walls game, im just saying that harden must not have felt a similar chemistry with him"
Turner was on the John Wall draft. He was definitely still on his rookie deal by 2014.
John Wall and Kyrie
"Truthfully, no I thought he would still be one of the better players in the league scoring wise just off that fact that he’s pretty much one the greatest pure scorers of all time, but he looks like he legitimately hasn’t lost a step. But not just KD, John Wall has also looked really impressive aswell"
"&gt; I hate how he bitched and moaned for 3 different superstars to get on his team, then get up and ditch them when the second he doesn't get what he wants.  Wtf are you even on about? He made a suggestion to get Westbrook because 1, CP3 shit the bed against you guys in 2019 and 2, he was available. Literally who else did he ""bitch and moan"" to get? Dwight? Nope. CP3? Nope. John Wall? Nope. It seems like you're making shit up out of pure hatred for the guy.  He was with our team for 8 years. It's not like he's Kyrie where he decides to switch teams every few years. If he wanted out after 8 years because Tilman is a dogshit owner that put off even Westbrook, MDA and Morey then he's free to do that. Why are fans of other teams trying to get mad for us when we don't even feel that way?  &gt; but I'll never forget how he just decimated the future of the franchise.  Because he's the guy that made sure we didn't trade him for Simmons just to spite Morey, right? Oh wait, that was Tilman."
Some posters are aiming too low. Prime John Wall/ Trae young  lowest I would be content with.  And still would be disappointed I didn't get an AD or Curry.
has anyone said john wall yet
John Wall
John Wall
John Wall
"No more praying for Eric Gordon to make a basket, hoping John Wall and Cousins knee's will stay healthy or if Christian Wood is going to show up against a big that actually plays defense. He got a top 3 player with him and another top 15 player coming soon."
"You wanted him to take chance with a John Wall who’s been out for almost two years and a Boogie who’s a husk of a man?? Hardens championship window is closing and he made the smart decision, it doesn’t mean he’s guaranteed a ring but he has better chance than if he stayed."
"Good showing from the baby Rockets, especially Mason Jones and C Wood.   Can’t wait till we get John Wall, Eric Gordon, Boogie, Danuel House, and Sterling Brown back into the lineup. We still haven’t played a game at full strength."
"yeah prime CP3, Westbrook, Harden &amp; Curry &gt; John Wall, Kyrie, Lowry and D Rose."
&gt;John wall and Kevin Durant tore there Achilles and look like they haven’t missed a step. I think we’ll see advancement in longevity  Excellent point..
With the advancement of sports science and just science in general I think primes are going to get extended. John wall and Kevin Durant tore there Achilles and look like they haven’t missed a step. I think we’ll see advancement in longevity
No way MJ is the second best player if he can't get to the playoffs in an incredibly weak conference.  If MJ is the second best player than he would be better than John Wall and the Wizards and win at least 43 games which you're saying he couldn't do.
"Why do people seem to think that just because you say something true doesn't mean it isn't disrespectful?  So if John Wall came out and said ""James Harden is fatter than he's ever been"", that wouldn't be taking a shot then because it's true right? Think about how stupid that logic is. I'm guessing most of the people arguing this are in their teens because I've never seen so many people baffled by the concept of simple professionalism."
John wall avg 3 3s a game shooting 32%. Has simmons made 3 3s yet?
Gonna have amazing spacing next to John Wall for the next 4 years.

"John Wall also not shoot, so both not shoot, meaning rockets no shoot playoff west, but maybe shoot playoff east?"
#BALL HARDER THAN JOHN WALL
"Man I hate Tillman too but you really need to give it up, you comment about him more than any Rockets fan. What are Ben Simmons and John Wall going to compete for the next couple years? Just like the Lakers did before they got AD and LeBron the Rockets are choosing to bottom out."
"OP happened to leave out this part:  &gt; Let’s be honest, Simmons and Houston point guard John Wall wouldn’t be a great fit. They both need the ball. The Rockets had to know that wouldn’t work.  &gt; But the Sixers thought they had a deal for Harden done, according to sources. The team won’t come out and say it, but Morey pushed hard to reunite with the 2018 MVP. Simmons and Thybulle were even informed by their agents on Wednesday of an expected trade.   Sixers thought they were getting Harden but they got played, simple as that"
George Hill and D wade and John wall
John Wall and Ben Simmons lmao.. can you think of a worse all star guard pairing?
Eric Bledsoe and John Wall
Clippers get John Wall
"Yeah, it's r/nba that's tripping. Demarcus Cousins and John Wall had nothing to say about Harden. Wouldn't it be just as easy to look at Eric Gordon and say of course he doesn't feel disrespected since they've been through many wars together unlike other guys who don't really know Harden like that and felt disrespected?"
sure i agree his teammates were bound to feel disrespected by this type of comment. but if you look at the rosters of championship teams the past 5-10 years it’s hard not to come to that type of conclusion. or just look at championship teams’ luxury taxes. ultimately he said what he said to get traded. he even requested the trade before the westbrook trade happened so it’s not like he said “oh shit john wall that’s not a winning player”. but yeah i get why his teammates might have felt slighted.
"Give him time, not everyone bounces back from major injuries and a lot of time off as well as John Wall has."
They’re probably going to try be as competitive as the Friettas budget allows for this season and next then John Wall comes off and they go full on tank. I don’t think Tillman wants to tamk until COVID is done. He refused to trade Harden until Harden demanded on live television lol. He definitely wants to at least try and stay in the playoffs for now
"Post torn Achilles John Wall, Christian wood, and washed boogie cousins as your best players and a new rookie hc? Harden was not out of line at all. He wanted a trade and is 32. He wants to win. He hasn’t yet. Only thing he did wrong was force cp3 out for Westbrook. The rockets weren’t winning anything this year and everyone knew it. Rockets were the ones who said let’s get uncomfortable so harden obliged."
"&gt;Dwight Howard, CP3, Russ and John Wall disagree.  Everyone who has ever played with him seems to disagree."
John Wall is the first one listed that I don't think has a shot
"was I wrong?  you are a textbook bandwagon fan. you're beginning to support another team because your guy now plays for them. That's what LeBron fans do, and nobody takes them seriously.  my favorite player was Kawhi Leonard, and I was probably his biggest dickrider of all time. I got to see him get drafted, develop as a player over watching hundreds of games, win Finals MVP and back-to-back DPOYs - but I'm not about to start rooting for the fucking Clippers. Fuck that dude.  How can you continue to support a guy that forced his way out of 'your team', while players that are still playing for 'your team' are calling him out on his shit?  I literally watched James Harden completely give up against the Spurs in 2017. dude accomplished nothing for the Rockets, unless you want to call a regular season MVP and shitting the bed in numerous playoff series an 'accomplishment'. at least Kawhi contributed to our 2014 championship.  and lmao you have a Nets flair on but are speaking as if you're a Rockets fan. how can you not see what's wrong with that? People are gonna be confused.  John Wall plays for your team now, and he's a great player and an awesome person. How about sticking to backing that guy?  and you can still like James Harden. You do you. but that doesn't mean you need to become a Nets supporter."
"&gt; Remember that. If this was 2017 and I told you John wall, Oladipo , and a 20 and 10 player were on a team you’d say ok that’s a 4/5 seed.  If this was 2012 and I told you that Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, and a 25/6 player were on the same team you'd say ok thats a championship team   Critical detail there is that its not, in fact, 2012"
"Except he's a horrible fit with John Wall who is also not a good shooter and the Rockets will be hardcapped even after this season so they can't sign anyone to improve the roster.  If they trade Wall for a superior talent (keep in mind, they'd have to get someone back that will make them a championship caliber team), they'd have to ship out all their picks which they are already short on. Otherwise they'd just be a mediocre playoff team that's going nowhere.   Trading for Ben Simmons just doesn't make any sense when the Rockets want to do a full rebuild. If they had their own picks I'd agree with you but since the Westbrook trade they gave half their future picks to OKC. Also, Simmons could easily walk when his contract ends since the Rockets won't be able to contend."
begone john wall
I don't care what anyone says... John Wall will be better than this guy
"rockets with prime john wall obviously  we'd go from a 14-win team to like an 18-win team, maybe a 20-win team. show me one other team where putting a player back into their prime results in a 50% improvement."
"It's Christian Wood, washed up John Wall, a guy that sounds like if a 5 year old tried to spell Jayson Tatum (he's actually pretty good tbf) and a bunch of G-Leaguers  Not counting KPJ in there obviously since he wasn't there when Harden was in Houston"
Also known as the Marcin Gortat and John Wall relationship dynamic
It's on the post:  Russell Westbrook - 16td / 38gp   Darrell Walker - 15td / 283gp   John Wall - 7td / 573gp   Wes Unseld - 7td / 984gp
Someone like John Wall you mean? LMAO
"I like John Wall and I hate that Harden’s on the Nets, but people really tried to say that man had a talented team around him before he left Houston."
You're paying John Wall more than that to not make the playoffs at all but keep trying  Weird how guys like Pop think Simmons is fantastic and both KD and Bron wanted him on their all star teams. But I'm sure random redditors know more than them.
"John Wall, folks.  Jesus christ."
"Really? From his 11th game of the season to the ASB (the period where you say Westbrook played well) he averaged **21.1pts/9.9ast/4.7tov on 49.8% TS. He had a -12 net rating.**  For reference, John Wall (who everyone agrees is washed) is averaging **20.5pts/6.7ast/3.4tov on on 50.3% TS with a -13 net rating.**     So Westbrooks ""playing well"" period is a little better than a washed up John Wall lmao"
John Wall 2/12 wut 💀
John Wall bought one of those 4x4 Mercedes G Wagons yesterday and said fuck tonight's game.
John Wall exists
"The Houston Rockets 2019-20 back court combined for 73 points, 25 rebounds and 34 assists today. Well worth the remains of John Wall, a bag of Doritos dust and a fizzed out can of Diet Coke they got in return for those two."
John wall hasn’t shot over 50% in a game in over two months
"I was upset that we didn’t get to see how John wall looks before we traded, but if we would have kept him long enough to see him play, we wouldn’t be able to trade him for a used jock strap"
A team stupider than your team. A lot of stupid teams and GMs in the league. Trade him to whoever gave John Wall a supermax.
"He’s only 26, has little durability concerns other than an ACL 4 years ago he’s completely recovered from, and has been a top 10-15 player this year.  This isn’t like John Wall or Russ."
"while your at it might as well let John Wall get his knee scoped, they’re trying to develop Kevin as a PG right?"
Lol anyone remember that hawks season where jeff Teague was taking that “new fastest player in the nba” title from John wall and was either an all star or a projected future all star?
John Wall did it better last week.
""" People ate up what John Wall and Cousins said about him who’ve been in Houston for like a month. "" I mean they were forced to answer question in training camp while Harden was in a club partying in the middle of a pandemic, I'm not the biggest fans of those 2 guys but let's not act like they were in the wrong to be mad about Harden.  &amp;#x200B;  I agree with the rest, and honestly if the Nets implode, it won't be because of Harden, he's pretty stable"
John wall and picks for horford lol
"buyouts are unnecessary. if a team wants a player, trade some assets or gtfo.  it's not like the player is stuck either. John Wall, Russell Westbrook, and Chris Paul all got traded with epic, massive contracts."
"Those are called ""wings"" and mostly play SG or small ball SF because their strength as a SF would be more useful guarding SGs considering the height difference. A good example of an undersized SF is Kawhi. Slightly shorter but he's still able to play the position because of his length and strength. Other examples of undersized SF that performed way better at guard are MJ, Kobe, VC, Wade...they all have excellent size for a SG and only good size as a SF. Besides Wade, who was often faster and stronger than his matchup, they can abuse a smaller defensive match up. I think all the most versatile guards could play SF in college. Guards like Harden, Westbrook, even prime John Wall. I think they could've played SF but are just way more effective at guard. Less popular examples are all the ""wings"" in the NBA. Guys like Norman Powell and Gary Trent Jr. There's a plethora of 2/3s in the NBA. If you're about 6'5"" and faster, youre a big guard. Stronger? Small big man. That's about it."
"&gt; If Houston traded for John Wall, a supermax player coming off 2 years of not playing and did not foresee the possibility of a buyout, then they are dumb as dogshit.  They trade for him with another player in the same boat. If they were ""smart"" not to trade for Wall then what would had happened? Buyout for unhappy Westbrook?    &gt; When was the last time a buyout came out of nowhere?  &gt; Were you suprised when Aldridge, Griffin, Batum, Dieng, Drummond were bought out?  Again my problem is not the buyout, is the fact that players want these ridiculous contracts then act surprised pikachu when teams can't trade for them and immediately ask for a buyout basically fucking the team. These are players that shouldn't be buyed out and yet here we are. Don't sign a massive contract if you know you will be unhappy if you don't win in the next two years. This is not the only problem this CBA has. Players forcing out of their contracts 1-2 years after signing is another. Something has to be done with guarantees because this shit is just getting started."
"I'm reposting an idea I had yesterday. Let me know what you think.    There is no buyout option, but here's how the waiver process would work. The team decides to waive the player, the other teams then bid on how much they are willing to pay to have the player for the remainder of their contract. Best and final offer blind bidding. The player then goes to the winning team who pays the player the amount they bid spread evenly over the number of years in the contract. If the amount is less than the player's original contract the original team pays the difference.  If the new team bids more than the player's full contract the original doesn't pay anything, but they don't get anything either. (There shouldn't be a financial incentive for waiving a good player on a good contract). The player plays out the remainder of their contract and becomes a free agent when it's up. This way:  * The player gets all the money they signed for. * The player can't make more money by not living up to their contract and getting bought out. * The player can't ring chase by not living up to their contract and getting bought out. * Players that have some value but don't live up to their contract aren't wasted on teams that are trying to be bad (think John Wall). It basically helps to get players into a situation where they can provide value. They don't have to financially cripple every subsequent team just because their original team signed them to an overpay.  * The original team can recover from a bad contract more quickly. The amount they have to pay to get off the contract will be less since another team is going to pay fair market value. They still are punished because they have to pay something for a player that isn't playing for them. * The large market advantage is dampened because small-market teams have an additional way to acquire players. This helps the league broadly by increasing parity."
"When was the last time a buyout came out of nowhere?  Were you suprised when Aldridge, Griffin, Batum, Dieng, Drummond were bought out?  We are talking today about buyout candidates a year from now and we're on Reddit.   If Houston traded for John Wall, a supermax player coming off 2 years of not playing and did not foresee the possibility of a buyout, then they are dumb as dogshit."
Chris Paul and John Wall  Also Tim Hardaway should be over Kyrie
"He clearly started throwing games after his first few.   His first 3 games: 37/5/11 on 53/46/89 splits  His next 5 games: 18/5/11 on 40/27/84 splits  John Wall says ""*You want to jump off the cliff after nine games?""* Harden says ""*This situation is crazy. It’s something I don’t think can be fixed. Thanks*."""
"Russ and John Wall are indeed untradeable UNLESS they’re being traded for one another. Same was true for Christopher Emmanuel Paul after he looked like was in stark decline in his last year in Houston. After the season he had in OKC, he put himself on a different planet then either of those guys as well as big Al Horford."
Are you sure? I think John Wall will be leading the Rockets to many championships starting this year
Not as good as the tank commander John Wall **salute**
"If you're sayin Dennis Schroder or Andre Drummond fulfill the definition of a super team, you're kind of scratching the bottom of the barrel. Those two have combined for one All Star, and that was a reserve pick when John Wall got injured."
2014 Washington Wizards came very close:  - Bradley Beal (60)  - John Wall (52)  - Andre Miller (52)  - Paul Pierce (50)  - Ramon Sessions (44)
Westbrook right now is better than walk ever was. Fuck John wall.
If that were true John Wall would’ve been bought out ages ago.
"Its crazy you can notice the corpse of john wall, yet not the corpse that is boogie."
Tyson Chandler was asked to be the 9th best player in their 9 man rotation. Boogie was brought in to be a part of a big 3 with Harden and the corpse of John Wall. Big difference.

"This year no College team is nearly dominant enough. I do think the 2009-2010 Kentucky team has a chance to hang with a bad NBA team.   PG: John Wall SG: Eric Bledsoe  SF: Darius Miller  PF: Patrick Patterson  C: Demarcus Cousins  Depth is an issue but that starting lineup is solid.   The 2014-2015 Kentucky team is also a possibility. You had Andrew and Aaron Harrison, Trey Lyles, Karl Anthony Towns, and Willie Caulie Stein starting with Devin Booker, Tyler Ullis, and Dakari Johnson off the bench.   Not saying they would win, but saying they’re maybe in the “on a random night” proximity."
"Wizards fan because I grew up outside DC. Jeff Green and KD fan because I was born in the same city / grew up in the same county.

John Wall?
I feel like trading him for John Wall would be the best result from an entertaining me stand point.  For Presti to be involved with 4 of the worst contracts in the league and profit off of each one of them.
John Wall is why they do care about the cap. The owner isn't that rich and the pandemic hurt all of his businesses. So when Harden wanted out they used it as a chance to get out of future salary and basically nothing else. There is no other reason to flip Allen other than that.
Wow. What? You don’t salary dump a top 5 player. They have John Wall on their roster. They shouldn’t give a fuck about the cap for the next 2 seasons anyways.
"The Warriors picked number two last year after winning a championship two years ago. Unprotected first round picks have enormous potential value, especially from a team that has a limited shelf life and virtually no young guys to carry them into the future.  It’s gonna take 4-5 years to know if the trade will be any good and you can’t properly evaluate it right now without knowing how the 2022-2027 Nets looks. What were the Rockets gonna do with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Christian Wood, and a buncha nothing? They’d take a step back from where they were still."
"F. They complete fumbled their entire organization in a matter of weeks. They went from taking Golden State to 7 to being possibly the worst team in the league. Plus, John Wall is making 40M a year for another 2 seasons. Dark days ahead for them."
"I can cherrypick shit like that for days.  Damian Lillard hit 2 series winning buzzer beating shots in his career, Jordan hit 1, Lebron hit 0. Clearly Lillard is the most clutch player of all time.  Or better, John Wall hit a game winner vs the Celtics in Game 6 that one time. Surely he is a better clutch performer than Kobe Bryant, who missed that one game winning shot that one time in one of the seasons I picked."
I definitely think John Wall qualifies.

"Playing well in the G League just means you can be a bench warmer in the League. Keep in mind that a ton of current NBA players came up from the G just to ride the pine now. You've got to truly dominate G League to get meaningful minutes in the NBA.  That said, I don't know why Lin can't reproduce the magic from his Linsanity days. You don't go on a 10-game tear by luck; there has to be some skill involved. He also outplayed John Wall in a rookie scrimmage, and Wall is a starter now. Mind boggling."

"Lol, Harden wants to win a ring Houston aren't serious in building a contending Team around Him. As an ""Employee"" He also has all the right to leave a team if he wishes to do so, He asked to be traded during the off season so as for there to be no drama, they didn't and then he had to force his way out because that is the only for a Superstar to leave a team that weren't willing to trade him. Like John Wall and fucking Cousins would help Harden in the West"
"I think it would be interesting to look at average difference in win shares between the 1st and 2nd pick in the draft. You’ve got your Shaq and Alonzo Mourning cases: transcendent player and all star quality but far away in comparison:  Your Duncan/Van Horn in a transcendent player and a quality starter but the gap is bigger  Then the Lebron/Darko case: transcendent player and bust.  Like since 1990, the best number 2 picks have been KD, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and Alonzo Mourning.   An MVP all timer, two all time point guards who couldn’t quite be the best player on a championship team and an all star who was never really the best at his position.  Contrast that with the 1st picks with Shaq, Chris Webber, AI, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, and that’s just the 1st team MVP types.  Then you’ve got Kyrie, Ben Simmons, KAT, Larry Johnson, Yao, Blake Griffin, John wall, multiple time all stars who have been the best player on a playoff team (or in the case of Simmons and KAT will obviously get there)   That’s 15 guys in 30 years who can be the best player on a 50 win team. That’s good odds"

"I'm a Heat fan but Butler is not better than Beal imo. In fact you could place a few players ahead of Butler....Trae Young, John Wall, Middleton, Klay Thompson, I think Bam Adebayo is a better asset than Jimmy...Butler can't shoot 3s, but wins when it counts though. It was the team of the Heat that brought them to the finals. Not just Butler."
kyrie without shooting is like john wall
why? They werent even on the team when Harden asked for a trade.  Of course theyd rather him stay and drag them to the playoffs but we dont give a fuck.what they want here. We want the picks and assets from the Harden trade.  Btw John wall:   https://hoopshype.com/rumor/john-wall-james-harden-showing-up-and-working-hard/

"The last time bradley beal was in the playoffs, the wizards had a starting lineup of John Wall, Beal, markieff morris and Marcin gortat with Kelly oubre coming off the bench.

"Well you need a Rocket to get to the Moon right?  So, Bradley Beal and a 1st Rounder for John Wall trade?   It only makes sense."
This is how I felt about John wall. Feels bad man
"John Wall torched everyone because he's a fast bulldozer. Lavine got him tonight, whose playing at All-Star level and we're on a back-to-back.  He's still a solid defender."
You definitely don’t remember prime John Wall if you’re saying this then.
"I mean, it was John Wall, dude."
John wall did this shit a bunch of times lol
"That series also sold me on Siakam as a longterm player for us. We put him on John Wall and he was holding his own, as a power forward. Crazy defensive effort.   Of course I never thought he'd be a 24 ppg 2nd-team all-nba player 2 years later, but he was definitely a promising player."
You ain't John Wall baby 😂
This man really is John Wall reincarnated
"John Wall won me over in the Celtics/Wiz series a few years ago. Not sure how he is now attitude wise, but he brought an awesome aggression and grit to that series that i think the Celtics could definitely use"
Best you can hope for in return is a bad contract. Someone said Kemba and a pick for John Wall? Would Celtics fans be willing to do that?
"Since Harden has been traded, Wall has an AST% of 42.2% which is the same as his career average.   Also keep in mind, this is a comparison to Kemba Walker who has never averaged more than 6 assists a game while being a way less versatile defender.   Since Harden was traded Wall has been putting up 20-3-7 with notably better efficiency than Kemba.   Not sure why you want to shit on John Wall, but good chance you are going to continue to you whatever stat out of context to try and prove your point."
"Kemba costs $6-10M less per year than John Wall and is a better shooter.  Wall is most effective with the ball in his hands, at this point I want the ball with the Jays as much as possible.  Kemba has been bad so far this year but he's coming back off an injury, I am withholding judgement and panic until he's had more time and until Marcus Smart is back.     As soon as Smart comes back, the double big lineup of TT &amp; Theis can go away and it'll be easier for the Celtics to have more playmakers on the floor all the time.  I am still concerned about Kemba's size &amp; issues driving to the rim when it matters, but a 27 PPG Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum mean that Kemba won't need to do as much in the playoffs."
"He's not 2017 John Wall anymore. His downhill pressure isn't remotely the same, and that's being reflected in him creating much less for teammates.  9.1 assists is more than he's gotten in any of his 15 games this season. Some of those games came with no other ball handler playing for the Rockets."
john wall likes houston
john wall is a houston player
Would john wall really be pissed about getting to play with Jayson and Jaylen? He instantly makes that team a lot better.
john wall would be pissed af
Kemba is untradeable at this point unless he shows he has more to give offensively. One name though I'd be interested in John Wall. Only issue is I don't think the Rockets have a reason to bottom out.

Definitely the Rockets. John Wall is still a really good PG. Before C Wood got injured they were legitimately in the Western Conference playoffs mix despite losing Harden and trying to integrate a rehabilitating Oladipo.
They did a booth review to determine whether or not John Wall was the one who shot the ball. Refs need to be fined
Did bill say something about players growing up without a father? I thought that was cowherd about John Wall?
"Thats exactly what I was getting at, just wanted to give that side of the coin. Ppl making fun of it cus they dont know what living like that might be like. Shit is chaotic out here for some ppl and they over here sitting cozy laughing at somebody that might actually have problems.  But pray for Kevin Porter Jr, and Kevin Love is such a standup guy for speaking up. Gang sign John Wall is one of my favorite players too and I love that Derozan is a crip. Fucking clowns"
I think a Kemba + FRP for John Wall trade would benefit both parties.
"If straight up jump shots aren’t allowed, I’d say Kyrie and John Wall as well, they really make some spicy layups"
"Kemba, first, and a second for John wall who says no?"
"Imagine being in a locker room with Boogie, Eric Gordon, John Wall, PJ Tucker. I dunno why Im just thinking it'd be so awkward because they all have these straight personalities/attitudes."
John Wall doesn't run like he's 30 years old
Trading John Wall for Harden + 4 more first round picks would fix that.
Beal is a lockdown defender when he puts in effort. He learnt from John Wall and started not caring about defense when he became a star
Yall would be scary with John Wall. But probably need a better big man first.
"Your team traded John Wall for what remains of Russ and thought that was a good move.  There have been ZERO effective adjustments done to help Beal who is in his prime.   You are a sad pathetic excuse of a fan for a sad pathetic excuse of a franchise and when Beal's contract runs out and he leaves your bum ass team in the dirt, they'll be as fucking irrelevant as they are now."
Neither did John Wall. Or Eric Gordon.
"Yeah, it's just not gonna happen. Dude ended with his assists per game 10.5 and he had 9 seasons where he didn't average 10 assists per game. Just imagine how insane that is. If you took out every season he averaged over 10 APG, he'd still have 7.7 APG. Still good for 56th all time in assists by the way, just behind John Wall."
"Hayward's last year was great and he was an expiring at the time. Like Hayward lucked out hardcore cause he had his worst injury at the start of his contract and then was able to work himself back up to being pretty much at the same level he was pre injury but with less touches (hence the lowered scoring output).   Plus Hayward pre Boston was good enough to be an All Star in the West in 2017 and the first scoring option for a 50 win team out west. Like if Hayward played in the east he probably would have 3-4 all star selections before the Boston days and injury. It's unfortunate that Hayward wound up undervalued by the public and thrown under a bus by the armchair analysts. Anyone who paid attention knew everything was green lighted for him.  You look at a guy like Kemba who had a few lightning years in Charlotte before coming to Boston and really no one said ""oh he's an upgrade from Kyrie"" they said ""oh he offers less of the drama that Kyrie had, he'll be a great locker room presence"". Like Kemba has had so much less proven and then he finally tastes the playoffs with Boston and to be honest he kind of underwhelmed and had a good number of games where he just was a non-factor. You don't want the highest paid player on a championship team to be that. Kemba just never got the great playoff experience he needed early on in Charlotte. Besides, there's no guarantee Kemba doesn't pull more injuries and drop off even more and he still has a few more years left on a contract that pays him $37 million in a few years. Kemba just looks so much harder to sell regardless, borderline John Wall tier especially if he gets another injury."
"Long post warning (just wanted to write about 4 of my favorite players ever)  Stockton - He really had it all except athleticism. Incredibky efficient shooter, amazing passer and stealer. He also could randomly go off for a high scoring game in the playoffs if he was left open on 3s. He was also sneakily the 2nd best defensive pg after Isiah and then GP later. The biggest knock on him was he lost to Hakeem and Kenny twice and would always lose to the Blazers. No shame losing to those Bulls teams, but can't be getting outplayed by Kenny Smith constantly.  Cp3 - If he didn't get hurt in New Orleans he wouldn't just top this list, but I believe he would be the best PG ever. He retained most of that speed and was still fast on the clippers. But in his early NO days and at Wake Forest, Paul was explosive. Unbelievable acceleration and great leaping ability. Kind of like a shorter peak John Wall that could actually shoot. His biggest weakness was his injuries. Ofc the Houston injury being the most devastating.   Nash - The best player on an iconic Suns team. His scoring often goes underrated, but there were multiple series where Nash would explode for multiple 30/40 point games along with his usual 15 assists. He was pass first, but when he needed to score, he could do it with as much efficiency as anyone else. His biggest flaw was his defense, but this is definitely overstated at times. The suns in general didn't play too hard on defence despite having good individual defenders like Marion, Bell and Diaw. Because they just gave up many points in transition anyway, it didn't really matter that Nash was on the floor since he was there for them to counterattack. This probably led to fatigue for the Suns in the playoffs 5hough as they constantly fell short  (Aside from the Amare suspension year)  Kidd - An all around PG, who wasn't a very good scorer. He later became a serviceable shooter, but by that time he lost his athleticism that let him be a strong finisher in his early years. He did make it to the finals twice, but it was in the weakest East possibly ever. Both Nash's suns and Paul's clippers would probably beat those Nets teams. He did contribute a lot to the Mavs title run, but realistically was behind Dirk, Terry and Chandler in importance. Maybe even Marion. He was a terrific defender as well and a coach that rivals Scott Brooks."
John Wall also gives great interviews. Two down to earth dudes.
John Wall 😢

"There’s two different types of athletes. There’s graceful speedy lankiness that has an almost  and then there’s just raw power driven by pure quick twitch kinetic energy. You can usually tell by how they dunk.   Ja Morant comes to mind as one of the former, you can add Derrick Rose to that category too. Then somebody like Russell Westbrook or John Wall is just pure power when it comes to dunking.   But the rarest thing is when you have that ability to almost glide in a big man. You usually only see it in guards or wings, but by god Jonathan Bender had that as a legitimate 7-footer."

"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he’s a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he’d be an awful fit. Though I’m not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he’s a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ’ for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he’s a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon’s a different story in my opinion. And I’m not even all that high on him but I think he’d work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there’s a fair few other guys I’d say the same about even if they’re not as good players in a vacuum."
What about Damien Lillard or John Wall?
Wasn’t he faster than John wall?
John Wall  Russell Westbrook De'aaron Fox
"&gt;The average 1st overall pick is closer to John Wall. 3x-5x all star. 1 or 2 all NBA teams. Probably not a hall of famer.  Honestly probably not even this good; I got curious and looked through a bunch of the first round picks on wikipedia and a surprising number of them didn't make more than 1 all-star game.  I realize that's not the most rigorous way to look at this, but nobody's paying to go through all of the #1 picks and rank them by all-star and all-nba selections"
I think 2010 would be fun  PG: John Wall  SG: Paul George  SF: Gordon Hayward  PF: Derrick Favors  C: DeMarcus Cousins
"Optimus Dime (John Wall).   I also liked the translated Chinese nickname for Harden being ""The Porcelain Prince"". IIRC it was about people faking injuries for like settlements or insurance fraud or some shit. Aka perfect for a guy who creates/fakes contact and gets rewarded with free throws."
"&gt; I remember reading like 3 years ago that using WS/48, the ""average"" #1 pick is as productive as Paul George.  Paul George is like a 7x All NBA player and a future hall of famer. He is WAY above average for a first pick. Unless your stat is doing some cumulative math and LeBron/Duncan/Kareem are skewing the numbers for #1 picks way too high on average.  The average 1st overall pick is closer to John Wall. 3x-5x all star. 1 or 2 all NBA teams. Probably not a hall of famer."
"Nowhere near a bust, and he was a great and imo underrated player in his prime, but John Wall was still a disappointment to me. I think a lot of it has to do with his vets as a young player being Arenas, Nick Young, Javale McGee etc.  In 2015, he was all-defense and later developed into a point guard that could protect the rim somewhat. Given his athleticism, speed, and strength, he really should have developed into one of the best defensive point guards in the league. Instead, he was never as engaged on that end as he was that season. Offensively, he has insane leaping and speed that clearly could be used off the ball, but he refused to give it up and learn to play within an offense.  Despite all that, he averaged 23/11 with 27/10 in the playoffs in 2017. He should have been an MVP level player though with his skillset. Elite handles, elite speed, elite passing, great size, great athleticism, all-defense level defender. It wasn't even the jumpshot that killed him, but the inability to play hard on both ends because of nagging injuries even in his prime."
John Wall vs Kemba Walker
"As someone who has felt that John Wall is about the average for what you should look at in a first pick, I feel vindicated. KAT looks better than I expected, even though I had him pretty high."
Current John Wall is like Westbrook with none of the upside
John Wall playoffs from any year
John Wall is still a Top 22 PG bruh.
John Wall is 6th all time in APG and 3rd all time in playoff APG
"Non-homer edition  John Wall, Kobe, Embiid, Pau, Dame/Luka"
"Gilbert Arenas, Ron Artest, Giannis, Kobe, John Wall. No order."
"In no order: Kobe, LeBron, Kawhi, John Wall, AD"
“John Wall is a perineal all star”
What if the Rockets build a wall which includes John Wall? Could this be key to unlocking the next level of defensive walls?
"Many people thought Melo going to play in China, after he was done with the Rockets. It wasn't just to say he was done as a star player, but, that he had no place in the league, beyond just the Rockets and their expectations of him  ""John Wall is a two-guard sort of having to play point guard"" - Skip Bayless, circa 2014, in response to Wall's first max deal"
You’d have to protect John Wall from the poachers
Rachel “John “Kevin “loul “Chandler “josh smith” Parsons”Deng” Love” Wall” Nicoles
"Westbrook was the least efficient player that got a first place mvp vote. The list includes players like John Wall, DeMar DeRozan and Isaiah Thomas. That and he almost got swept in the first round. Harden should have won that MVP."
"Don’t forget AD, Simmons, Draymond, John Wall also have massive contracts as well."
"Rich Paul also got John Wall the contract that most people feel is the least team friendly one in the league, and he did by also getting him a 15% trade kicker."
"He represents Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons to name a few other big contracts. Both make over 35m a year, while Lebron makes 42m. He also represents guys like Lonzo Ball and John Wall who have contracts above the league average. He's making 13m in commission off those 4 contracts over the next 5 years probably, by the end of Lebrons career he could have made close to 30m easily, especially considering he has so many young players under contract, if even one gets a max that's another big payday. All that mainly because of insider connections, and free exposure from having Lebron as a best friend/Premium client"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"Other big clients are AD, ben simmons, draymond green, Anthony edwards, and John wall for those wondering"
"No, but the guy who represents clients such as Draymond Green, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, John Wall, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis probably is a legitimate agent. Noel happened to get the short end of his attention and got fucked over because of it."
"I mean yes it is a legit agency which is why plenty of guys like Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, and John Wall have gotten paid while being represented by Klutch/Rich Paul. The tampering thing is stupid because every agency tampers since it isn't just Klutch guys who sign deals 1 minute into free agency or get multiple guys that they represent who are friends on the same team. The rest of what you said just sounds like hating honestly. How can you hate on Lebron helping to fund a school in his hometown?"
John Wall is my first guess  I seriously hope he makes it but I can't guarantee DRose will be a HOF
"Trying to convince rockets fans at the beginning of last season that John Wall is in fact not a mix of ""cp3 and westbrook""."
"Look, man, if you think Tatum, Brown, and Beal aren't capable of anything more than a conference finals in the next five years, that's *your* shitty take. Beal was a capable off-ball player on those pre-injury John Wall-led Wizards teams, Tatum and Brown have literally done nothing but get better since they got into the league, and we *already* made a conference finals *with* them being two years younger each and our third option being Kemba scoring 18 points a game on 55% TS against the Raptors and Heat."
The 2 Rocket's goats James Harden and John Wall played a brief stint together
John Wall will make his entrance dougie before announcing each draft pick !
John Wall
Also his 57 points against the Wizards in 2017 regular season. There was a clip from after the game of a fan asking why he hates D.C.? That game was after John Wall said that the Wizards were the best team in the East.
"Yeah it's easy to pick this apart in hindsight. In 2015 though, John Wall was primed to be the best true PG in the league, Demarcus Cousins was (debatably) already the best C in the league, and Anthony Davis led the league in blocks and PER at 22 years old, and got the Pelicans in the playoffs. Injuries have set all of these guys back, but Anthony Davis is still easily a top 10 player in the league."
"Expirings aren’t worth very much anymore   Pretty much only if that team has key plans to size someone in particular, as in a bigger market who knows that they will definitely be signing a FA. Not the highest chances of finding this circumstance to work in a trade  Or for a bad contract. Wonder if John Wall is in their eye"
Wiggins was pretty much John Wall level of HS prospect hype so not totally surprising.
"That list is clearly meant to be using the hindsight we have now. They’re not saying John Wall seemed too high then, they’re saying he is listed way too high compared to reality."
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
John Wall
And he was supposed to be a mix between Chauncey Billups and John Wall.
John Wall incoming?
John Wall was not too high at #15 in 2015. He looked like he'd be the best PG in the NBA in 2015
"Honestly not a bad list at all for 2015  Bender and Okafor were busts   John Wall, Klay, Blake, and DeMarcus Cousins broke down with injuries   Westbrook and Deandre declined with age. Both of their games didn’t look they’d age well though   Drummond was empty stats back then too.   KAT and Wiggins were overhyped as prospects, at least KAT made an All-NBA team  They were higher on Giannis than I was back then   I guess they thought LeBron retired.   The craziest thing is that Jokic is not on their top 20. He really came out of nowhere."
Thank you. Dudes a great player and people hating on him for a 25 mil a year contract. That’s almost half what John wall getting paid.
Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox are basically the second coming of John Wall and it won't translate into legitimate playoff success
"John Wall as well, though he showcased it in a different manner generally. Dude's burst in the open court was absolutely obscene."
He'd be John Wall tier if LeBron didn't come back to Cleveland. He won't even get past the first round until he eventually goes to BKN with KD.
John wall's a wall for the bricks he put up last szn smh
Raleigh:  PG John Wall  SG Devonte Graham  SF Nate McMillan  PF PJ Tucker  C Chris Willcox  6th Chris Clemons
"I’m not saying they aren’t looking to make a trade just that the ones mentioned here just don’t make a lot of sense. The John wall one seems the most likely out of the ones mentioned, but still I’d rather have rondo, Kennerd and Beverly than wall. I don’t think he’s any better than either of them at this point.   They are definitely looking to do something but a three team trade or a pg13 trade seems more likely than what’s being proposed here."
"We are not giving up Zubac and Mann for CJ. Rather put together the Kennard, Bev, Rondo package and take a risk with John Wall and returning draft picks."
"Wow these are some of the worst theories I’ve ever seen. Literally none of them make sense. How in the hell can the clippers who have no draft picks get anyone worth a damn. Only way an actual big trade is happening is if kawhi is upset with Pg13 and they are shipping him out. They don’t have the assets to get dame, cj or siakam and why in the world would they trade half their roster for John wall who isn’t any better than the fodder Included in the trade for him."
Its gonna be John Wall.
John Wall to LA
John Wall likely isn't going to take a buyout and leave all that money on the table.  Walker was fine with it but don't expect anyone else to be that generous.
"If I’m the rockets I move John wall, install KPJ as the PG, throw green at the 2 and just let them ball.  It’ll work, trial by fire."
The John Wall one is even worse though.
Rockets are gonna be fun to watch as long as John Wall doesn't ballhog.
If I’m the rockets I try to get John wall out of town by the deadline.  If that doesn’t work I’d honestly bench him and let KPJ and Green start as both guards.  They’re both egotistical mfs too so it wouldn’t destroy them like a lot of prospects would. They suck terrible as the 1&amp;2 options for a while but it’d make them better quicker and they’d go out on the floor like they’re both micheal Jordan even while sucking.
[We can buy him out](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-buy-out-john-wall-for-the-houston-rockets?qid=03e2ae14a725369fb564859fc2e73a90)
FlexSeal^(TM) makes John Wall fit best
"Well, surprise in the sense that they could be a 30-35 win team if the roster, as-is, stays healthy.  They definitely have an intriguing, if unbalanced roster. 99% of people are writing John Wall off, but honestly I think he plays better in 2021-22 than last year -- and he played admirablt considering the injury, just overshadowed by Durant's stellar play from the same injury.  Wall is still an excellent playmaker, and while he clearly didn't trust his teammates last year, to be blunt that roster was injury-riddled trash.  They should be fun to watch...a very interesting rebuild for sure. The West will be as tough as ever, but it's very possible they've already leap-frogged Sacramento, San Antonio and Oklahoma City with Green, Sengun in addition to Porter and Wood."
"Just like if a defender lands on an offensive player...can't have guys just launching onto people with no consequence. Imagine Stephen Adams launching(I know, right? Lol) onto John Wall...would crush every bone in his body."
NBA Champion Jeremy Lin   Jk I have no idea if he was good in summer league but he did have a game against John Wall https://youtu.be/PvkXmMcGfLo
Enjoy the lottery and your best player being Christian wood. Or is it John wall? Or the guy who hasn’t even played a game?
I mean John wall still is there
"He was the number one option on a half decent playoff team that beat the John Wall and Beal lead wizards, but I feel like he hasn't gotten any better since then, and teams don't want to deal with the guy who wants to be a #1 option, and has the issues that he does. As well as the issues with how much money he wants."
"I feel like people forget he was the #1 option on a playoff team who beat John Wall and Beal. The problem is now, that idk if teams want to do that even though that's what Schroeder wants to be."
John Wall take it or leave it.
You’re acting like he’s John wall post-Injury contract. We won’t be giving him up just for the sake of it lol. You’re being delusional there’s no logic to this.
"Pretty sure it makes him 7th, with Steph Curry as the highest paid. John Wall still 2nd tho.  [Source](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  KD salaries aren’t updated but a 44.14 figure would still be 7th in 22-23."
John Wall
Totally forgot John Wall is on the team.
"Derrick Rose and John Wall are 2 that can think of. Although D Rose MIGHT make the HoF. Slim, but possible"
John Wall….
"John Wall tearing his Achilles slipping at home,while recovering from a infected heel injury."
"You don’t want bigger, less aggressive John wall?"
"&gt;I'm a bit confused by how low the # of all defensive teams is for iggy  Dave Berri showed, I believe in ""The Wages of Wins,"" how a players votes for defensive awards went up as their scoring did. Basically, the best way to get more defensive awards votes was to score more.   It also hurts Iguodala's case that two things seem to drive the public perception of defense:  1) On-ball perimeter defense, delivered with attitude.   2) Emphatic blocks, even if they go out of bounds.   Iguodala's great at on-ball perimeter defense, but what makes him a head-and-shoulders better defender than Tony Allen, Avery Bradley, John Wall, or Mike Conley (the guys who landed all-defense spots above him) was this preternatural ability to break up an offensive set off ball. He had a near-unique ability to anticipate a key pass, and simply move ahead of the play in a way that the pass was never even attempted, and the offense had to reset.  The value of something like that was something you had to watch him to see, especially because until 2015 or so awards voters tended to scoff at analytics.   Also, Kobe deserved many of his defensive accolades, but his all-defensive picks in '11 and '12 were absurd - entirely based on reputation and not what he was actually doing on the floor. There were some great posts on Silver Screen and Roll - a Lakers fan blog - breaking down just how awful his defense was in that period).   In my opinion, Iguodala is one of the most criminally underrated players of the past 30 years. We have four examples (Iguodala leaving Philly, arriving in Denver, leaving Denver, arriving in Golden State) which suggest that Iguodala's presence was worth 10-15 spots in the team defensive rankings. That's unheard of for a perimeter player."
"Off the top of my head, some of the unfortunate ""bizarre"" injuries that have happened in baseball include a pitcher breaking his own arm (twice) on a pitch, and Mike Soroka re-tearing his Achilles while walking around, a day after getting the boot removed after recovering from his previous Achilles tear.  That said, it's not like weird injuries don't happen in the NBA, like when John Wall tore his Achilles while at home recovering from heel surgery."
"I remember in like 2014 someone asking derisively how good the Wizards would be without John Wall and I fired back ""about 5-28"" and like people don't appreciate how much Wall turned around the Wizards even with being stymied by Grunfeld's #SoWizards incompetence. I was there for when they traded Webber and Arenas, and both of them had their time in DC poisoned for whatever reason (Webber was relatively outside of his control and Arenas' mostly in his with the rather large injury aside), and both of those outcomes were annoying and consistent with how the Bullets/Wizards luck/decisions had played out in my lifetime, but yeah, trading Wall just gutted me."
John wall
"Oh wow completly forgot that the pick would've been in OKC. Makes it even better, even if I'm one of the 1% here who think the Rockets took the right deal.  I guess a lot of people here would've rather build around Simmons and John Wall or have the right to pay Jarrett Allen 20 millions per year"
Nobody has watched John Wall since 16-17 lol he basically died for two years and resurrected  on the worst team in the NBA
I haven't watched any John Wall since he disappeared after the 2016-17 season. Is he that bad now?
"Multiple factors. Being younger than most players that blow out their achilles,  not being reliant on explosiveness like a John Wall type, not being heavy like a center, and medical advances compared to guys even 10yrs ago. Still have to see how it holds up over multiple years but as of now he looks just as good as he did in 2019, which is impressive. I figured he would still be a top 10 guy, but I thought he would only be like 90% of the player he was. Good for him"
"We had this years ago in the John wall/Terrance Ross dunk contest and it was awful, absolutely no momentum and just looked like watching a shoot around.  They really just need to embrace that the 3-point shootout is the premier event now, and the slam dunk contest is the warm up for that"
"It'll solve some/most of the problem of Super Teams as well as talent distribution, but also create other problems at the same time.  There will be more instances of teams who draft well and manage to develop 2 or 3 ""stars"" be forced to pick one or worst two to let go once they hit RFA.  Teams who make mistakes giving big money in free agency (which happens every year to many teams) will suddenly be stuck with a declining or injured John Wall or Westbrook contract that is now not just 30% of the cap terrible but 50+%  of the cap terrible.  Those franchise will basically be trapped until the contract expires."
Something something John Wall
"Dawg, I wanted badly for KD to join you guys in 2016. John Wall is one of my favorite players ever and that would've been his best shot at getting a ring."
"If Nets/Lakers is the finals and your team wins, legally you get John Wall on a vet minimum though."
"You have to be a nephew to think KP has no value. This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making.  Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Let's not even get into about 10 guy that have straight toxic deals like John Wall, Tobias Harris, (formerly) Kemba or Simmons.  THJ, especially on the new deal, and Kleber have more value than DFS."
I'm guessing a reference to Cowherd saying John Wall will never succeed because he didn't have a father figure growing up? Not sure how it fits here though
Damn that’s wild. They should trade for John Wall
John Wall got Otto Porter PAID.
John Wall and Austin Rivers were my favorite
"The Rockets were tryna tank for a Jalen so it did work tho.  I love John Wall though since Wizards are my hometown team, hope he actually gets healthy…"
The dude was the John Wall of 2019 lol it’s funny when people try to rewrite history based on his OKC resurgence  We were lucky we even got Russ in the first place
John Wall always relied on his athleticism
Yeah but John Wall gets you Filipino Kobe-  Jalen Green
You have to remember before CP3s resurgence in OKC it was viewed as one of the worst contracts after like John Wall. Paul couldn’t even drive past Looney at that point SMH
I don’t know about that. John Wall was pretty fucking terrible this past season.
Westbrook is still top 20. John Wall regularly struggles to score 20
"I’m repeating this same thing over and over again because you keep asking the same question. How are you oblivious to that?  Your interpretation of what I said clearly varies from my original quote. I said that he wouldn’t  initially return to the prime version of himself. My 50% assumption is right in the ball park of his productivity reducing from 20-40%.  While 31 is still within the prime years of an nba player, missing two years to major injuries must still be factored. Younger player such as Demarcus Cousins and John Wall, although not having similar play styles to him, returned to less than 50% of their prime due to less severe injuries.   &gt; You basically said he’d suck  I don’t know where you derived your victimization complex necessary for you to misinterpret my words, but clearly, you’re hell bent on believing that’s what I stated, so I’ll leave you with whatever makes you sleep at night.    &gt; Between these two comments...this is where I check out. No point in even entertaining u.  In what world is Steph even an average defender? He is known for being an offensively-concentrated player with poor defense. Him leading the league in steals per game in 2016 doesn’t excuse that fact, and if you believe that qualifies him as even an average defender, you are exhibiting your lack of basketball knowledge.  You know you can’t validly refute both statements, and decided to pretend like it’s even an absurd thing to say. In fact, ask the GSW fans on Reddit, and they’ll echo the same sentiments that I do regarding all these."
"It’s definitely not Porzingis. The way KP played was partially on the coaching staff. He knows how to move without the ball but the team had him camp out at the 3 whenever Kawhi was on him. He’s a solid off ball cutter (doesn’t get utilized because we have 0 secondary playmakers) and at least tries to get open for threes.  There’s way dumber players in the NBA. KP is up there in most disappointing, but there’s guys like John Wall who legitimately do not move when the ball isn’t in their hands."
"I think Durant coming back from a devastating injury and looking just as good as before has helped people forget about the likes of John Wall and Derick Rose.  I don’t think anyone has gone on a limb and said Klay will definitely be back to form, I think most people have hope he’ll be fine or prefer not to think about it"
"I watched plenty to see if John Wall could do anything, which he couldn't I know. I also was rooting for them because I love Stephen Silas. I was interested in KPJ so I watched a decent amount towards the end of the year too. I mean no disrespect to KPJ but I would argue noone can truly be in the mold of Harden. He will go down as one of the best offensive players of all time and a player who could ruthlessly pick apart most any defense thrown at him. I love Luka with all of my heart but I would even argue he's not fully in the mold of Harden. Takes a lot more than one year of putting up stats on a garbage team for me to believe you can fully make it there."
The Lakers will spend $44.2M total on the contract of Russell Westbrook in 21-22. The Rockets are gonna pay John Wall $44.3M during that same time.
Send him to the Rockets for John Wall
"I apologise in advance if I have offended your star player. I understand that as a Jazz fan, you might rate him highly compared to other centers.   However, you’re paying him 40m per year. The only player a team is paying that amount that is a shelf of his old self is John Wall. Most max players, other than Ben Simmons, are able to do everything such as shooting and create for other players.   To win a game, a team has to score the MOST points. Even Ben Simmons was rebuked for his underwhelming performance this post season even with his great defence accolades in the regular season. If you look at Gobert’s stats, his free throw percentage is below the leagues average.   For the price you’re paying, as a Jazz fan, do you think you’re utilising the cap space by paying so much? With confidence, can you say he’s worth every penny?   If you read properly, I said that Curry and Booker. I also said that he cannot guard well outside the paint. I never said he wasn’t the best or considered the best. I like how you selectively take out my points and have this narrow approach.   We can trade our views back and forth, but do you actually believe you can win with Gobert on your team when the Western Conference is already so stacked? If you read the post correctly, it says is he worthy of a HOF, which I said “definitely” and he’s one of the best defensive player. Like any team sport, there’s no such thing as the “BEST” player only “ONE” of the best."
Why does it feel like John Wall signed a 25 year $2 billion contract?
"Not really, John wall also has a shitty attitude on top of that."
"Thanks for that. John Wall has been my favorite player going on a decade now. I've seen so many games in person where he put the team on his back and pulled off wins against contenders, giving us a show.  I didn't like going for Russ because I foolishly thought they were both going to end up washed and I figured loyalty was smarter. I'm fully willing to admit both that I was wrong and that this path gets us competitive faster and has much more chance of keeping Beal.  End of the day, it's not fun watching a shitty team, and unless that players name is Kobe, I'm not all that interested in someone well past their prime collect big money. Still love and root for Wall's success though."
"Guys who are still making more than Randle after this extension:  DeAngelo Russel, Kevin Love, Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Jrue Holiday, Rudy Gobert"
"John Wall, *and a first*."
One John Wall coming right up!
John Wall super max contact....
How is John Wall the worst contract?
"Russell Westbrook averaged 24/6/8 as a second banana to KD during John Wall's career. During that same time, John Wall averaged 18/4/8. Russ had better efficiency btw.  Not to mention advanced stats, where westbrook completely blows John Wall out of the water, but that could be excused since John wall was on a much worse team with his second option being a young Bradley Beal compared to KD for Westbrook.   Sorry, but John Wall was never better than Russell Westbrook at any point in his career."
People were trying to understand at the time if trading for Westbrook was for a reason at this time because they both were considered fast guards even though we didn't know the state john wall was gonna come back in. Now everyone is considering it bad.
Dunno who wizards GM is off the top of my head but he’s done a nice job as well considering how fucked their situation was with John wall
"This reminds me of the First Take clip when SAS went on his rant about the Wizards and Max replied back and said, ""There's always a sucker out there"" when it came to a team trading for John Wall...😂😂🤣"
The disrespect to my man John Wall
I was mad to see John Wall get traded but I can’t lie this is an amazing turnaround
I wouldn't count any free agency signings and sign and trades as a flip for the John wall contract.
"wow wizards got a lot for getting rid of John Wall and Westbrook. Wall and Westbrook aren't even good anymore. Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma are all players who can produce in the right rolls. If they have decent seasons next year they suddenly got a lot of assets out of players that were high volume, low efficiency, and very expensive."
John Wall better
This all started with the Wizards somehow finessing the Rockets to give them Westbrook for John Wall.
Don't let that guy convince you he's a wizards fan lol John Wall is the best thing to happen to the Wizards in the 2010's
Does John wall still play for the wizards?
"Y’all are acting like they traded BI for John Wall. They improved marginally, got rid of the coach that didn’t mesh with the team and hired good assistants."
All we got for Chris Paul was Westbrook.  All we got for Westbrook was John Wall.  What can ***WE*** get for John Wall?
&gt; carcasses  Carcasses of John Wall and the Lakers
"I love John wall, but he was coming back from 2 career ending Injuries, considering we had to give yall a protected 1st for russ (a contract literally no one wanted), it shows how little value he had."
john wall did more for you guys than all those dudes combined will lol
"&gt;They used to be the Bullets and if you combine Bullets and Wizards you get Buzards, a (misspelling of a) large bird which sustains itself on the flesh of carcasses, which is appropriate because that's exactly what they've done with John Wall.  This might be the single greatest r/NBA comment that I've ever read. I mean, it has everything."
Wiz are going to have a legit full rotation of players. Not a bad result from the John Wall deal
"We essentially traded a broken John Wall + Hutch + 2 second round picks for  Harrell, KCP, Dinwiddie, Kuzma, Todd, A Holiday. Outside, Dinwiddie, the value is really in the size of each of these contrats. All moveable. If Beal leaves and Tommy wants to rebuild, its possible. A rebuild would be a lot more difficult with Wall/Westbrook handcuffed to their cap.  HOT DAMN TOMMY WE BRINGING OUT THE BED TONIGHT"
John wall + 1 first + 2 seconds ackshually
"John Wall isn't even a wall, he's just a human being"
There will be no John Wall slander in this chat
"Or Wullets, which sounds like wallets, which John Wall managed to fill his."
"Punny, DC will always love John Wall tho."
Can any of them dougie like John wall ? Don’t think so
So a whole lotta nothing? Yall really act like managing assets means anything. They're no closer than they were before John Wall got injured
"They used to be the Bullets and if you combine Bullets and Wizards you get Buzards, a (misspelling of a) large bird which sustains itself on the flesh of carcasses, which is appropriate because that's exactly what they did with John Wall."
They'll at least be easier to dump than John Wall I guess
that’s meh but John Wall being trash makes it a good deal
"They’re still decent rotation guys who can be flipped at the bare minimum.  I didn’t claim they were stars lol, they along with there contracts are just amazing in context to John Wall."
"This, most people named in the thread does not have a MVP to their name. John Wall is a lesser Rose, people just remember him because of the recency bias and the albatross contract. Rose was firmly top 3 until his lower body fell apart, and people have already forgotten."
1. Manute Bol proportions  2. Isaiah Thomas height  3. John Wall speed  4. Shaq play style  5. DeMarcus Cousins attitude  6. PatBev defense  7. Ron Artest mental stability  8. James Johnson fighting ability
"Kevin Porter - if he figures out his shit, he's going to be a problem. He may only ever be ""John Wall"" status where he is a franchise player but isn't in that Tier 1 superstar convo."
"Washington wizards: 2000-2010   Starts with Kwame and MJ  Then we have some good years with Arenas, Jamison, etc.  Then finishes with drafting john wall, and our franchise point guard and a future convicted murderer pulling guns in the locker room"
"I don’t think anyone will ever forget Carmelo, he’s in the Harden/Westbrook/Barkley tier.   Paul George  John wall  Bradley Beal  Cousins  Horford  Butler  Millsap  Oladipo  There’s a lot of players who aren’t gonna be heavily remembered in 15yrs."
"I feel like this could have different brackets.  Self destruction: OJ mayo, Lamar Odom. Injuries. D-Rose, Jabari Parker, Andrew Bynum Good player but still kind of qualifies: John Wall, Cousins, Porzingis Guys who were legit top 5 but got old. Melo, Dwight, Marc Gasol Guys who plateaued early: Trevor Ariza, Al Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Malcolm Brogdan."
i was convinced he was going to be better than john wall lmfao
John Wall was the most hyped thing coming out. Once he got injured he lost the thing that made him special and hadn't developed in other areas. I feel like this might be a cautionary tale for zion. I also feel like this could happen to a lesser degree to Giannis.
Kobe picked him over John Wall in an interview
It's probably John Wall. The best answer to this question is usually someone who is way overpaid to the point where everyone thinks they are a bad player when they aren't.  Ben Simmons too. He's obviously a crazy good player. All this noise is about expectations.
"The late 2000s/early 2010s was around the time when I was really hung up on the idea that it was extremely rare for a PG to be the top guy on a championship winning team, so teams should instead go for SGs or forwards with extremely high ceilings.  I supported Michael Beasley over Derrick Rose, Evan Turner over John Wall and Derrick Williams over Kyrie Irving. I am not a smart man."
Absolutely. John Wall is already a shell of his former self and Wood will probably get replaced in a few years anyways
PG is so stacked it's great. Here's all 30.   LAL - Westbrook   GSW - Curry   Kings - Fox   Suns - CP3   Houston - John Wall  Mavericks - Luka   Pelicans - Graham   Spurs - DeJounte Murray   Grizzlies - Morant   Portland - Dame   OKC - Shai   Nuggets - Murray   Jazz - Conley  Wolves - D’Angelo Russell  6ers - Simmons  Nets - Irving   Knicks - Rose   Celtics - Smart   Raptors - VanFleet  Bucks - Jrue   Pacers - Brogdon   Bulls - Ball   Cavs - Sexton   Pistons - Cade   Hawks - Trae   Heat - Lowry   Wizards - Dinwiddie   Hornets - LaMelo Ball   Magic - Fultz
Victor Oladipo and John Wall at the bottom for pull up % perfectly describes our season last year
"Great player, but not “generational”.  That season was like the apex of his professional basketball career and if that’s the best version of John Wall, that’s still a pretty darn good NBA player.  I feel like people wanted more."
&gt; I would not take any iteration of John wall currently over just about any year of Paul’s career.  So you wouldn't talk an All-NBA or All-Defense caliber player over a rookie CP3?
"Wall was the third best PG in that season behind Russ and Steph.   The disrespect on this thread to 2016-17 John is unbelievable, he's probably past his better years, but he was unreal."
At no point in either of their careers has John Wall been better than cp3.
"Regardless of who was better I consider both Rockets legends. Chris Paul for getting us that close to beating the Warriors, and John Wall for getting us that sweet draft position, he a GTCOAT for that"
"I can’t believe John Wall is gonna ruin the KPJ-Jalen Green experience  But Wall did help KPJ improve his playmaking tho, maybe he helps Jalen too"
Even at CP3’s worse he was a better PG than John wall
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
ehh shit talk is just a result of critical opinions. ain't trading john wall without some shit talk thinking.
"It’s not even close Paul was clearly better. You can’t just go by raw stats for everything. CP is a better leader, more efficient, runs an offense better, assist to turnover god, and has proven for sooo many years he’s amazing when not injured. I would not take any iteration of John wall currently over just about any year of Paul’s career."
CP3 has been better than John wall every season of Walls career
John Wall. Ppl forget bc of the association with his name now but he was INSANE before he got injured
"It seems like almost every team has a pretty good point guard these days. Even teams that are far from the playoffs are fielding guys like DLo, Fox, Sexton, John Wall, etc"
"I like Ja, but prime John Wall was no joke.  That is a perennial Top 5 PG and All-Star in your prime that could take teams to great playoff runs."
"Fine. Porzingis becomes the MVP, and clear 1 option. Luka can’t handle not being the center of attention. Demands a trade. Dallas front office scrambles and gets John wall, Schroeder, and Simmons in return  Luka joins the lakers"
Jalen Green - Bradley Beal/Zach Lavine  Anthony Edwards - Bigger Donovan Mitchell  Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton/SGA  Ja Morant - John Wall  Jonathon Kuminga - Raw Paul George  Tyrese Haliburton - Malcolm Brogdan
Trade him for John Wall
Houston John Wall is what’s being referred to here
"Every year I say, ""this is the year we see Kevin Love return to form"" and every year there is something that prevents him. Be it injuries or other mysterious circumstances...I am left feeling utterly confused.  The way things have shaken out, his 4 for $120m has to be up there with the John Wall contract being one of the worst in the league."
John Wall.
I feel like John Wall has been 30 for like three years
"SF's had the better talent at the top but PG was the deepest by far. Steph, Dame, Russ, Kyrie, CP3, Drose, John Wall, Mike Conley, Isiah Thomas, even Deron Williams was still good back then."
"1. I believe so too but less because of Ingram's lack of defense but more because he seems to need to have the ball in his hands a lot to get his game in rhythm. The problem is that the Pels are putting the ball a lot more in Zion's hands which means less time for the ball to be in Ingram's hands. If he can further develop his catch and shoot game I think they will have a chance to get into the playoffs. They might not win a series though as the WEST is stacked and looks like it will continue to be in the near future.     2. He is not better YET. I think a lot of us think he will be soon. I just think something is a little off when I watch him. You can see the overwhelming talent but it's like he is Josh Hamilton before he joined the Texas Rangers.     3. Yep. I think you hit the target on this one.   4. I don't think G-League Ignite is a waste or money. Neither is it competing against the NCAA really. It more of competes against overseas leagues who attract players who don't want to play in the NCAA. They want to make sure that these young players can get into the NBA as soon as they can, optimally a year after their high school year ends. Some overseas leagues will of course want to sign some of these young talents but will try to tie them up to longer than 1 year deals. The players will then have to buy out their contract or if it play it out. If it is a 2 year deal or 3 year then it takes longer for those players to get to the NBA. It also is not looking a gift horse in the mough when it comes to the NCAA. NCAA teams are about winning first so they can get more money by getting to the NCAA tourney. Player development is secondary especially to the most special players. The one and dones. I remember seeing a opinion head who follows college basketball opine a few years ago that had these options been available at the time to John Wall and Boogie, they would have been much more ""NBA ready"" compared to the state of their games when they came into the NBA from college."
John Wall is 30?
"I feel like it makes sense. Same draft class as John Wall, one day older than John Wall. How old did you think he was?"
"I don't think Allen Iverson has more raw athleticism than Russell Westbrook, or John Wall, or even Fox or Morant. They're bigger, they're faster, they're stronger, they jump higher. All of them. If you put those guys back in 1999, just off their athleticism alone I think they are in the exact same area as AI was assuming they stay healthy.   AI did have insane athletic advantages in 2001, but the difference is that the gap between AI and the league in 2000 is way larger than the gap between AI and the league in 2021. The advantages are significantly less dramatic. Damn near every guard and forward in the NBA can dunk a ball between their legs like it was a lay up. The list of people who could do that in AI's prime was very, very slim. I know that's a very specific example and doesn't encompass everything athleticism is, but I think the fact the league went from a dozen guys could do that to hundreds indicates the difference in athletic levels.   That also means that there are a lot more guys who have a much greater chance at keeping up with AI than back then, and the help defense is significantly quicker to react to him; and again, the schemes on both offense and defense would detract from AI's numbers. Not just in that no coach is going to let Someone play 43 minutes a game and shoot 28 times every game, but defenses are  pretty equipped to deal with volume shooting mid-range and driving guards.  I think AI could maybe become a top 15 player, maybe, but like I said it would take a massive overhaul of his game. He did win 4 scoring titles but you have to take into account it was at 42 minutes a night and shooting 25-30 times a game. Some of those scoring titles he shot under 40% for the season. That just isn't going to fly in the league today. I mean Russ is noticeably more efficient than AI and his poor shooting is the biggest gripe people have with him, imagine what would be said about AI.   I hope I'm not underrating his athleticism. He was one of my favorite players of all time and I've watched an egregious amount of his games post-retirement over the years as well. He is an athletic freak in his own right, I mean even being able to play that many minutes and put up that many shots every single night is an athletic feat, no matter if they go in or not. But in the league we have today you need to be beyond AI level athleticism for it to make the same impact.   LeBron, Zion, Giannis, that level. Even at the guard position think about the guards that succeed on a superstar level that don't have a great jump shot (read: 3pter). D. Rose did in the early 2010s (and the league shoots double the amount of 3s as it did during his MVP season), Westbrook has for his career, and maybe you could say Wall did before his injuries, but he wasn't a top 15 player. But all of those guys were significantly larger/stronger than AI and were able to play way, way, way above the rim. Because AI can't do that, it is going to make things significantly harder for him. He is not gonna draw 13fts a game nowadays.   The other PGs who 6'3"" and below who are/have been superstar level players are Dame, Steph, Kyrie, CP3, who are all generationally excellent shooters. Steph, Kyrie, and CP3 are also better dribblers and passers than AI. So at the very least AI would have to become an elite shooter to be in that top 15/MVP consideration. At least."
"You are wearing big time rose tinted glasses when it comes to Iverson, even outside of the fact that his shot selection had very little to do with the construction of his team. Shoot he took the same shots on a Nuggets team that sported one of the best offenses in the league, and while he had the most efficient year of his career, it was still not efficient compared to modern day scorers.   There are a boat load of players that are in the same speed realm as Iverson right now, and have been since he retired. John Wall, Westbrook, Fox, to name three. I think Fox is likely faster than AI, and there were reports coming out of Denver back in the day that Ty Lawson was as well since they had clocked them both before.   Don't get me wrong, AI was super duper fast, really he was more quick than fast, but there's a number of guys like that. It isn't a premium in the sense that you're making it, otherwise the above players would be much more ""unstoppable"" than they are or were.   The big thing with AI was that he was that fast, while being small enough to get under a lot of defensive pressures, and with a tier 1 handle. But even AI has specifically said that Steph and Kyrie are far above his handles, and Kyrie is probably only a hair slower, and a much better shooter. That's prompted KD (long before he played on the Nets) to even say that Kyrie is better than AI, and if we're talking about present day I'd say it's hard to argue otherwise.  I promise that AI was not some sort of victim of 2000s offenses more than any other player was, and those Nuggets offenses he was on were the exact opposite of his 76ers ones, and I watched every one of those games. The shots that AI liked taking were step into deep mid range pull ups, baseline shots off the dribble, and a billion different things at or near the rim. Those shots will be more available to him now than they were then, but for good reason, and defenses are much more sophisticated now to deal with offense like that.  Like I said, AI would have to become a significantly better shooter, especially from 3, to be an unstoppable player in today's league. At least to the level that we perceived him to be in the early 2000s. It is much more likely that he would be a 5'11"" Ja Morant than he would be a MVP candidate in the league now, who is another player among many that defenders can't stay in front of."
"Not a huge rivalry. But the Celtics and the Wizards had a pretty fun Rivalry during the IT, Crowder, Smart era with John Wall and others. They also had one of the best but somewhat forgotten series in recent history."
Fox being compared to John wall
John wall is severely overhated and underrated. He could start on a championship team tomorrow and put up 22 and 10 with better efficiency. Keep in mind Houston had been changing their roster all last season and it definitely took a toll on the players who stayed. I hope Houston buys him out or trades him to a contender
"be careful what u wish for  ""The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey to the Houston Rockets for John Wall, Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun, and their 2022 first round pick"""
&gt; Most small market teams have cheap owners who use the guise of nobody wants to play for us to not offer big contracts to stars.  This is the exact opposite of what happens. Small Market teams overpay like crazy to keep star players. Look what the Wizards did with John Wall of the Thunder with Russ.
James Soften  Piannis Antentenogo  Juan Ball (John Wall)
Healthy John Wall &gt; Kyrie Irving
"Anyone from the group of John Wall, Isaiah Thomas, Russ, Kyrie, Dame, CJ, Beal, CP3, Harden could’ve swapped with Steph and that team is the heavy favorite going into the season. They’re flanked by Kevin Durant and 3 other HOFers for Christ sake. I know Steph is better than anyone in that group and they couldn’t play the exact same style but it still has infinitely more talent than every other roster even excluding the PG position."
"Eric Gordon, John Wall, and PJ (who played with us a little less than half the season) are all kinda old."
Someone who moves at John Wall speed but with Kyrie handles and Stephs 3 ball
"Any contract is tradeable, especially one that is an all-star. He will be moved. Its not like he's John Wall."
"Ok East--  Who is he beating out, Paul Pierce, Rondo, Iso Joe, Derrick Rose, Kyrie, PG13, DeMar, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Lowry..."
"Rose, rondo, jo Johnson, ray Allen, Chris Paul, Steve nash, tony Parker, kyrie, jrue, John wall, lillard. With all those names that should answer your question. Was never a top 10 guard, and wasn’t even the best guard on his team some years."
I feel like john wall follows hardens strippers and cocaine method but doesn’t preform anywhere near hardens level.
"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but if you think John Wall is entering his physical prime then I have a bridge to sell you"
"They're 5th last year with Draymond, what's your point?  Draymond play like 40 games in 2019 (practically one with Steph, and the team is filled with D/G Leaguers), who admit himself that wasn't really trying in 2019, plus was playing injured most of the time.  That's like saying Wizards should have kept John Wall because of what they did in 2014.  At least if you wanna ""call a spade a spade"", wear some glasses and use some objectivity and use correct stat instead of doing ESPN's Stephanie A HOLE and yell across the room ""I AM RIGHT BECAUSE I SAID SO"""
He’s not taking in a personality like John Wall
"That’s disrespectful, John Wall has earned the title of Tank Admiral after all his hard work"
"Perhaps you missed this part: ""the *57 players* in the USA basketball pool (not just the final roster) were subject to drug testing:""  [Here's the full list.](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) In addition to the final Olympics roster, it includes players like LeBron, AD, CP3, Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi, Paul George, Westbrook, Butler, Lowry, etc. That's pretty much a who's who of prominent American players in the latter half of their careers.  Also, you've got the next generation of superstars in Trae Young, Tatum, Zion, Donovan Mitchell; then there's the class of guys who used to be elite and might be especially tempted to juice to battle the effects of injury or general decline: Kemba, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, K-Love, John Wall, Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, and Dwight Howard. That's a whole lot of guys signing up for DUI checkpoints."
It's okay for now.  Let's hope when the regular seasons starts they don't steal our tanking position.  John Wall is one of the best tank commanders in the history of the sport.  We must protect our goal of 28 wins.
"One of the great things about watching Harden was that he always made the right play. Guy open, they got the ball in rythm to shoot. His man playing off him, three pointer. Play too close, he drives for the lob or an and-1. You take Hardens vision, basketball IQ, and decision making for granted after watching it for ten years.  John wall was the exact opposite. Man open in the corner, he drove into traffic. His man playing off him, drive into traffic. Man on him, drive into traffic, or occasionally take a horrible three. It was like he had no court awareness combined with a need to play hero-ball. The result was the worst season in Rockets history. Although it sort of worked in our favor so I'm not mad at him."
Flashy plays/highlights (John Wall and LaMelo Ball)
&gt; How was John Wall last year?  He wasn't
he plays more like john wall at least recently
"Round 1 - Rondo: His goal has never been to outscore the opposing PG. His job is to facilitate and get the W’s which he did. Bulls had a 2-0 lead and the only reason why Isaiah Thomas got past the 1st round and not labeled as a choker was because Rondo suffered a fractured right thumb in Game 2.  Round 2 - John Wall: He’s more of a facilitator as well with his usual double doubles. Also, he had to feed Bradley Beal. That’s the only reason why he didn’t score more than IT.  Round 3 - Kyrie Irving: LeBron had the ball most of the time. Kyrie still did his thing more efficiently than IT and negated whatever IT contributed. Most importantly, he got the W.  For the playoff guards out West, we all know those guys would dominate IT in playoff situations. They don’t wake up for the Celtics no matter what their seed was because they could back down the PG any day and kill him on switches."
"You guys got off that John Wall-Westbrook money pretty cleanly.   Whatever record you guys have next season is what it is, but this was the Larry O’Brien trophy of offseasons for that alone."
"You can't give up a 2028 pick if you are the Clippers, let alone swap the year before too  All to get John Wall, why take on all that risk for a player who won't address their biggest concern (health) and needs the ball in his hands"
John Wall is useless on a contender. Dude put up 20 on 40/20/75 shooting when he had the ultimate green light. He's washed
Considering Marcus Morris is a better player on a a better contract than John Wall I wouldn't do that
when was the last time you watched john wall play
"Early, early on in the season people came at me for a take that Washington won the Westbrook trade and I was flamed for it because John Wall apparently has a chance to get better and Westbrook is on the decline. Awful, awful take.   Westbrook &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wall"
"Hey y'all remember when John Wall had that one above-average game and people were like ""Oh wow he sure showed the Wizards!"" lmao"
"Based on the spurs diagnosis, Kawhi's options were either play through the pain or retire. His quad problem would never go away even if he did no serious physical activity for a year.  It's not the player's word, it's the doctors word. Guys like John Wall and Klay Thompson got serious injuries that have known timelines to recover from. Kawhi had a chronic injury that would never go away."
"In round one of the '16-' 17 playoffs, opposing primary (whichever got the most minutes) PGs on the Bulls averaged 10-4.5-4, IT averaged 23-6-4. The Bulls had a group of Rondo, Grant, Canaan, and MCW, so not super impressive offense.  Against the Wizards, IT averaged 27-7-2 on 45-46-85. John Wall averaged 25-10-3 on 40-29-84. I'd say he outplayed John Wall offensively.  He got hurt against the Cavs and in his only full game had 17-10. However, in the regular season games he had against them he averaged 29.5ppg on 49% FG to Kyrie's 25.5ppg on 53% FG. So he outscore Kyrie while being respectable efficient, but Kyrie was more efficient. Fair trade off.  Against the WC, vs Steph (2 games), IT had 21.5ppg on 34% FG and Steph had 19.5ppg on 41.5%FG (and playing 35 and 36 minutes in those games). So Steph was clearly more efficient, but GSW had a much better defense than BOS and Steph is Steph, so it makes sense.  Vs. Dame (2 games), IT had 37.5ppg on 46%FG, Dame had 28ppg on 41%FG. Give me Isaiah.  Vs. Westbrook (1 game, IT missed the other), IT had 34p and 10a on 55%, Westbrook a 45 point triple double on 52% (and 37p on 54% in the game IT missed). Clearly goes for Westbrook, but nobody was stopping Westbrook besides himself.  Vs. Conley (1 game, Conley missed the other), IT had 44p on 63%, Conley had 19p on 38%. Easy IT  Vs. Parker (1 game, IT missed the other), IT had 24p on 43%, Parker had 7p on 43% (and 16p on 53% in the game IT missed)   Houston had Patrick Beverly, obviously IT outscored him handily  Vs. Paul (1 game, CP3 missed the other), IT had 32p on 53%, CP3 had 23p on 57%. Both had similar efficiency, but IT had 9 more points. I'll take IT.  Vs. George Hill (1 game, Hill missed the other), IT had 29 on 56%, Hill has 22p on 44%.  So IT vs. Playoff Guards, the only one who outscored him was MVP Westbrook, and IT was usually the more efficient scorer as well."
"Didn't Bill Simmons say this about John Wall a few years back? Like he'll never be a good leader because he didn't have a dad. Some bullshit like that.   I could be wrong about who said it, but someone definitely took an unnecessary dig at wall for his upbringing."
They probably don't need a third. John Wall was out there commanding an entire battalion of tanks last season.
"Why would you clear someone to play when you know he has a chronic injury and he says he doesn't feel well when he is playing out there?  How do you know the extent of pain in his body when he is forcing himself on the court? How can you judge that he can play thru it and when?  And why not keep all that inhouse?    What about the whole fan base going after him as the lier, traitor, thief...     Did any such thing ever happen in any other franchise? Several players like John Wall, Klay Thompson got year long injuries, has any franchise announced that the player was cleared now, he can actually play? It's always the player's word."
"John Wall doesnt factor into the Russ CP3 trade because he wasnt in that trade, we had major injury issues and tanked, and OKC have our picks in 2024 (1-4 protected) and 2026 (1-4 protected) when we should as least be close to a play-in team and a pick swap in 2025 (1-20 protected)"
"Lol is this a troll? We now have john wall, the worst record in the NBA, and OKC has three of our picks. Rockets got fleeced long term on this one"
"I understand your point, though, don't necessarily agree I just understand the statement your trying to make. You don't need to be top 10 in the NBA at your position to get paid that kind of money in fact I can think of a few players off top my head that may not be considered top 10 at their position making 100M or well above the avg to hit that with a longer contract: SGA, Tobias Harris, Trae Young (Depending on the list or who is arguing it,) John Wall, DeAaron Fox. Those are just the PGs for the most part I have listed except Tobi.   The real issue for Dennis is timing and positioning and he failed with both! Actually the real statement is he and his agent failed with both, as another redditor mentioned you kinda gotta question what advice was he really given? If timing was aligned for a decent jump in salary cap last year before he was traded and got the chance to be a FA (Aka if he was available) during that time there is a very real scenario where he would get the type of money he was looking for 100M? Maybe not 80M+ woulda have been likely, because, as you can see teams at the time where willing to offer him good money as noted from the Lakers initial contract extension offer. So, 1st the timing was poor and now the positioning is just as poor as the timing because Dennis decided to bet on himself and shit the bed. It is what it is and he must live with it, but, when you go 0 points in a playoff game as a starting PG that will just tank your value unlike any other, this is where we agree with the not top 10 part. We both are essentially saying his value has diminished so much how could he see himself at 84 mil at this point? That is the key at this point, last year coming of a 6 man of the year candidacy much better situation overall to get his money.  The bigger and better question is when the Lakers approached him about his contract extension what visuals were going on in his and his agents head? Did they consider him an All-star? Irreplaceable?Because lemme tell you that is not what 6th men are. What position did he think he could be much better in other than competing for a championship with the Lakers at a higher salary than deserved along with AD and Lebron?"
"John wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, DJ Augustin and Christian wood don’t match the timeline.   Then again he has 2 more years before his deal expires? I would wait until his last year if there are signs that he is not going to resign. He can also provide good experience for the rookies same as the other players mentioned above."
He could've been the Pacers John Wall.
John wall did it for a longer time definitely but you can’t tell me he was a tier above IT during that 16-17 season tho
It has never been a John wall level player. John wall was the best pg In th east for a while
"That peak was fun.  Making all sorts of difficult shots that you'd think he'd regress from but he just kept going.  That epic 7 game series vs prime John Wall Wiz was super fun  But yeah, literally the second he got banged up and lost even a little bit of quickness, it was all over.  Can't fully hide him on D with even the best of schemes and then wasnt getting enough separation to score enough to make up for the D"
"If John Wall received a supermax, was it crazy for IT to think he didn’t deserve one at the time?"
A dollar store John Wall on a 50% off sale.
"Indirectly lead to John Wall though, that didn’t turn out well"
"i would be extremely pleasantly surprised if that's how it plays out. on the plus side tho, john wall will do whatever he possibly can to make sure we get a very solid pick again next year"
"Hopefully John wall accepts his new found mentor role, and plays to help develop the young guys rather than ball hogging and jacking up shots"
John Wall - KPJ - Jalen Green - KJ Martin/Sengun - Wood  Maybe something like this would be the starting five.
so with john wall in houston is jalen green gonna come off the bench to start the season ?
"Lmao we're not gonna make any moves based around John Wall. At best, he plays well this year and we get something for him from a desperate contender next year. At worst, he sits on the bench for the next two years until his contract expires. But no chance we're gonna give up on an actual prospect for him."
So John Wall comes off the bench?  I just think KPJ is redundant with Jalen Green.  I’m almost certain they will look to move him.
I don't know if John Wall makes the cut when I insist that Khyri Thomas and Jalen Green start.
The ghost of John Wall will suffice for another top pick
"As someone who absolutely loves John Wall, this is heartening to hear."
I see him as something like a dollar store John Wall
thats great you can trade him for john wall then.
not if tank commander john wall got anything to say bout it
Don't forget about John Wall!!!
Russ &gt; 2021 John Wall = confirmed
"salary, we pretty much are free of the john wall and now the westbrook contracts. still probably gonna fuck it all up but hey"
Is John wall positive value?
"if you really think about it, the Wizards traded the worst contract in the nba (john wall) and a heavily protected first round pick for a solid 3&amp;D, an expiring, and kyle kuzma. not bad at all"
"Man I'd rather have Kuzma, KCP, Harrell and a pick for Westbrook instead of   JOHN FUCKING WALL"
I could be wrong but I think even a max player can get up to a 15% trade kicker. John Wall currently has one and he's on a max  But most players will waive it if they are being traded to a place they like
We gave up John Wall and the 2023 protected so you can do the math on that one
you’re wrong here. We have up an injured John Wall and a first and now we have three good players and a first round draft pick plus cleared $25 million in cap space.   That’s a huge win for the Wiz.
"Lol, whyyyyyyyy. Good on the wizards finally free of the John wall money"
And we gave him away for John Wall. The sad life of being a Rockets fan
Washington should feel good about this. The Wizards effectively got rid of the John Wall contract with a 1st round pick swap. This was the most toxic deal in the entire NBA and they might have even come out of this with net positive value if they can flip some of these Lakers to other teams.
Don't forget John Wall
"Their last rebuild got them John Wall and Bradley Beal. They committed, they rebuilt."
"Russ to LA  John Wall to Clippers  Two super teams!!! WOW   NBA is crazy, amirite"
"No they wouldn't.  Teams don't want Russell Westbrook, that's why Washington was able to get him for freaking John Wall (literally injured all the time and didn't play for almost 2 seasons) and a heavily protected pick."
There’s John Wall  We can even give you a pick with him
Yeah y’all need to trade for John Wall
Didn't they trade for injured John Wall? Not that far off. He actually defends and has more youth.
Detroit just making room to take in John Wall + 2 for 1 clearly
You know who you don’t need assets to get and is a meh PG? John Wall.
Ignore it. Raptors fans have a deep-seated bitterness towards us that stems from John Wall making Lowry cry like a bitch in the playoffs years ago.
"1993: Chris Webber &lt; Isaiah Rider, Terry Dehere, Sam Cassell  2004: Dwight Howard = Devin Harris, Sebastian Telfair, Delonte West   2010: John Wall &lt; Demarcus Cousins, Ed Davis, Damion James  2011: Kyrie Irving &lt; Jonas Valanciunus, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson  2018: Deandre Ayton &lt;&lt; Trae Young, Jerome Robinson, Anfernee Simons   I'm not sure at all about those"
Hell no they had their run. Send him to HOU for Gordon and Wood. Run the John Wall/Beal/Green train
What did Houston get for him? A protected first? Keep in mind John Wall who hadn’t played in almost two years coming off of an Achilles tear. The first didn’t even cover the burden of taking on Wall’s contract. Lakers have to pay this guy $47 million next season.
Westbrook got traded for John Wall and a pick. Now he's traded for that Lakers package and a pick? Feels like Houston got robbed again
I’d say it’s still John Wall
Westbrook played on a fringe all-star level with a Supermax all-nba 1st team contract. That depressed his value.  Considering they started with John Wall I think the Wizards front office has done a very good job over the past year. They got rid of his toxic contract and possibly could even end up with positive value when all is said and done.  Who knows with how many picks or young prospects they'll end up once they've flipped some of these players.
They done moved John Wall and Russ for Beal and ain't got an extension promise.
The rockets will offer John wall and the 24th pick.
Who says they're planning to re-sign them all? It's a quick way to enter a rebuild. They get a 1st rounder for Westbrook so they haven't made a big loss in the Houston trade and they get off his big money.  Think of it like this:  With these two trades the Wizards got off the John Wall contract two years earlier and saved $90m. They also got three useful NBA players of whom they may choose to re-sign or flip one or two.
Yeah. Beal to Sixers might go down  And John Wall to the Clippers
"Absolutely would take this.  Imagine trading John Wall for Kuzma, KCP, and Harrell (with a swap of 1sts)."
Trading for John Wall or something.
Yeah but why want that when you can watch John Wall brick 5 threes a game and take 20 shots
"My hypothesis:  Morey is trying to hype up Simmons value. And even though Simmons clowned himself he's still an all-star DYOP player, which we can see as many teams have expressed interest. The biggest problem with Simmons is his contract. It's like John Wall but teams are somewhat interested because he isn't totally washed.  So what I think is that Morey's real play is hyping is value, then trading him + assets for an all-star who can keep the 76ers as contenders. Maybe like Beal or Dame.   I mean it sounds stupid, and if I were portland or wizards I wouldn't do it, but it makes his stupid requests to the Raptors and Cleveland make some sense. Maybe the wizards trade Beal to 76ers for young assets, Westbrook to lakers for young assets, then rebuild while riding out Simmons contract? idk?"
Calling it now and it's gonna be Simmons for John Wall and some picks lol
John Wall and a Protected second round pick
"He talks about the NBA too, just depending on the timing I guess. But I don't think so, he's just known for being a dumbass (he said John Wall was a bad leader because he grew up without a father, for example)."
You can have John Wall and his 40mil contract if you like
"John Wall is the perfect fit for the 76ers, ignore my flair tho."
But what team would want John Wall. Dudes contract is brutal 44m this year and PO for 47 next. And the guy for some reason cant stay healthy.
KPJ really is a pg. So yeah no issues with fit.  Just bench John wall tell him to sit at home and get paid. Dude would just ball hog and make it harder for kpj and green to develop.
Baba is John Wall - lite
AYO who's Japanese John Wall on the break?
"Yes, it was lopsided. AI was old and very clearly past his prime. Chauncey was the heart &amp; soul of our team. AI was a really good player, but Chauncey was a top 5 PG in the league  It would be like trading, idk, Chris Paul for John Wall today."
"For sure.   John Wall, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Ben Simmons and Christian Wood is winning it all."
Does Houston not have young talent ? Also insinuating that Jalen green's minutes would be significantly impacted by John wall and Eric Gordon(both who will most likely be gone by the end of this summer ) is hilarious
"DeMar DeRozan, 4x All Star and 2x All NBA, is the median player at #9? He is significantly better than every other player on that list not named John Wall, and I'd still take DeMars career over Wall  Something isn't adding up"
"Actually his best years were 2009-2013 before he tore his ACL. He had a numbers year in 2016 with the kings but not John wall numbers and also didn’t go to the playoffs. 2017 he came off the bench for the Bulls that season, started in playoffs and led the to two wins versus Boston but broke his wrist right after. He helped Anthony Davis to his first playoff appearance in 2018 where they swept the Blazers. His 2007-2009 stint was good and he won a chip with the Celtics but he definitely wasnt the main reason why they won. During the 2010s, he was one of, if not, THE most important player on his playoff teams."
I am a Wizards fan and Tony Parker is better than John Wall
[Also Tommy Sheppard. ](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/wizards-gm-tommy-sheppard-says-team-has-no-plans-trade-john-wall)  He think he slick
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/11/23/john-wall-trade-rumors-denied/%3foutputType=amp
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
We can go back and forth on this but think Rondo should be a bit higher. I would say 8 and have John wall 10th. His battles versus lebron were spectacular
"John Wall -- missing prime years severely hurt his stock, because he was a stellar player  Dwight Howard -- almost everything about his run as part of the Magic has been forgotten  Tony Parker -- he was always productive, but, hardly ever in talks with the premier PGs of his time  Reggie Miller -- since he's been passed in the record books, he's overlooked for how good of a player he was in his time. Incredible longevity too  Patrick Ewing -- he was a hell of a player, but, lacked championship gold"
"OG Anunoby was compared to Jerami Grant, which was a fair comparable up until this past season with Grant popping off offensively  DSJ's comparison to Bledsoe was accurate, for all the wrong reasons lol.  Dearon Fox was compared to John Wall  Ben Simmons was compared to Draymond Green  Montrez Harrell was compared to Taj Gibson  Kelly Oubre was called a poor man's Paul George lol  Lavine was called a poor man's Westbrook, though they have similar playstyles, Lavine is a much better 3P shooter"
Fox's comp was John Wall
"He might not qualify as a legend, but, John Wall as a general playoff performer. For his career, he's averaging almost 22 ppg (21.9), almost 10 apg (9.8), almost 2 spg (1.7), and, 1 bpg. His last 2 playoff series he put up 27.2 and 26 ppg, 10.3 and 11.5 apg, and, 1.7 and 2.3 spg.  When Washington was a playoff team (before this past season), they only got 1 win without Wall playing at an All NBA level, and, he missed their victory due to a busted hand. Never been carried to a playoff win, during a poor performance. Never been swept. Never given up more than 2 consecutive wins to an opponent. And, only lost to the top seed (2014 - Pacers, 2015 - Hawks, 2017 - Celtics, 2018 - Raptors).  That's all with Beal as his best teammate (Ariza is arguable for 2014, but, Beal played much better than him in the playoffs), who wasn't even 25 years old in their last series together."
It is not mutually beneficial for John Wall to give any of that money back. He'd be crazy to accept a buy out.
Knew John wall wasn’t an all time great when he threw out the first pitch for the nats…straight garbage throw
It's pretty insane to me that cp3 was considered one of the worst contracts in the league a few years ago and has played himself into getting another enormous payday.  It would be like the equivalent of John wall or Gilbert arenas towards the end of his career coming back to form and getting paid again.
Jahn Woll is literally just John Wall but with a fake nose and mustache on  Also the act of reading the post made me feel like i have come ever so slightly closer to understanding what it must feel like to suffer a stroke
"Do rocket fans really like cp3 that much? He got injured and had chemistry issues with harden. Cost 2 first round picks, 2 2nd round pick swaps and ended up with John wall and a 1st round pick."
Jahn Woll is like the Dutch John Wall.
"I work for a different team, but I heard this from a M&amp;N rep. Charles barkley and OJ Simpson never came to terms to make products. That's why there's  so many fakes of them. As far as gilbert, there has to be a demand before there produced as well as clearance from the teams who buy the stock. The wizards ordered retros of John wall and Caron butler before Arenas despite him being the more popular but they ended on bad terms and they do not want to have him as a product representative."
"I mean, if Tillman can save 5-10 mil through a buy-out. He might do it considering no one is trading for John Wall. That's if Wall is willing to give the Blake Griffin discount to go join another team."
John Wall &amp; Boogie Cousins are only 30 years old
John Wall tore his achilles at home lol. NBA teams shld probably tie their stars down during the off season huh
"John Wall used to be electric, it's a damn shame about the injuries. Still, there are enough minutes to go around between Wall, KPJ and Green, should be fun to watch."
"John Wall is past his prime, but still fun to watch. I think he will be dealt before long."
It is until you remember John Wall is still in the mix
John Wall 5 years ago
"Mo was just as much if not more of an outlier. 7' with a 7'10"" wingspan, had his head above the rim on one of his dunks, 3.7 blocks a game, allegedly faster sprint time than John Wall. He was supposed to be Rudy Gobert but way more athletic and with a 3pt shot."
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
John Wall
"They could totally be successful with a ball-dominant guard, as long as that guard is a willing passer. John Wall is ball-dominant but he fed Beal and Gortat and Pierce and Ariza and Nene and everyone he played with. You need someone who can find BI and Zion in the right spots."
That John Wall gamewinner vs the Celtics in the playoffs was dope though.
John Wall was shooting 37% from 3 on 4 attempts per game before injuries really took his prime from him
"Simmons in his four years in the league did this:  ROTY  3 time all-star  2 time all-defensive 1st team. 2nd in DPOY in 2021.  1 all-nba 3rd team  That four year resume is absolutely ridiculous. This playoff run where he seemed mentally broken doesn't erase all that. Maybe he'll never recover and keep regressing but he's not a good example of a missed 1st overall pick.  Wiggins is though, but he's one of the only players who was hyped that much and flopped. Kyrie, John Wall, Rose, Griffin all came in with Cade-like hype and are/were top 10-15 players in their prime.  I'd say of the recent 1st overall picks only Zion, AD and Simmons came in with more hype than Cade. He's either on par with the rest or some of them are slightly ahead."
"Good point on the consensus type top picks. Not all drafts are created equal. LeBron James was a sure fire top pick. AD, Blake, John Wall, Zion. There was never a reasonable debate for those guys, and they were all very good players at their peak. Wall and Griffin were derailed by injury.   This year, some people say there’s 3 guys who’d qualify for the top pick in many drafts. Which as a Pistons fan makes me a little gun shy that Mobley may end up being way better than Cade."
"IIRC that default no trade clause is only on the first year if a player re-signs on a one year deal (or has an option for a 2nd year).   But overall the NTC is fine because it’s built into the contract. The team is aware of it when they sign the player. When a player takes a 5-year supermax and gets injured (e.g John Wall) that player gets that money no matter what. When they do the opposite and request out, it should also allow the team to get out of the deals they don’t want then too, right? The spirit of the contract is you get a locked in amount of money over an extended period of time, and in return you play for our team unless we trade you. Forcing a trade break the whole benefit for a team to offer a long guaranteed contract. And only leaves the downsides."
Vince was a bigger star in the 90s/early 00s than John Wall ever was.  He was right there with Kobe as the most popular wing in the league post Jordan.  As for T-Mac he was right there with Kobe in the early 00s and was getting all kinds of recognition.  He was considered one of the best players in the NBA full stop and was much closer to the top of his position than John Wall ever was.
"I would say Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, and John Wall have had decent careers."
The Horford one I agree had mostly to do with years. With CP3 he legit rehabbed his value. He went from being considered John Wall level negative value to being a positive contract. I even forgot to mention he traded Ricky Rubio from that trade for another pick lol.
I saw John Wall to Blazers and immediately scoffed.
"No.  The rules are different and FIBA 3x3 is super fast paced. It’s non stop. There is no stoppage, no time outs. Those 40 year old retired players would have a heart attack after one game or tear an ACL or rupture an achilles   It’s also more physical. Hand checking is allowed. Even shoulder checking is not called. If a player has a weakness in their game, especially on defense, it will get exposed  If america wants to win gold in 3x3 in the Olympics, they’re going to need to send their best YOUNG players  Even then, guys like Steph Curry, Kyrie, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, etc would get EXPOSED. They’re not built for the 3x3 format. They would be complete liabilities on defense and they can’t be hidden. They would get hammered physically. James Harden and Chris Paul would have to ditch their foul-baiting and flopping ways since they wouldn’t get ANY calls  Lebron would adjust and adapt and do very well in 3x3. Kawhi Leonard would also be excellent. Kevin Durant might struggle with the physicality but the dude can still shoot over anyone so he would be a good pick up. John Wall would be great as well. So would Klay Thompson. Westbrook would be excellent…..except he has a super inconsistent outside shot and you have to be able to shoot in 3x3.   If America sends guys like 50 year olds like Stephen Jackson, Cuttino Mobley and Iso Joe, they’re not going to last, especially playing two games a day. They will absolutely tear something or get a heart attack"
John Wall got traded after not having played basketball in 18 calendar months.  No one is ever on such a bad contract that they are untradeable.
Y’all Mfs treating him like he’s John Wall or something like he didn’t play like a top ten player when not playing through a fucking season ending injury
"Lillard isn't top 10   LeBron or Luka isn't top 5    Add Ben Simmons, CJ, Hayward, Sabonis, John Wall to trash tier"
"I know little about handball, but I bet Ja Morant would be pretty damn good. Super athletic with the ability to jump really far and finish through contact. He's around the size of an average handball player, so he could learn to be a good all-around player.  Kyrie, Kawhi, Westbrook, Fox, and John Wall might be fun to watch as well. I can imagine Kyrie mastering the curving shots pretty quickly."
John Wall made an all star career out of it
I will be very surprised if he transcends John Wall or even Kyle Lowry level much less Jason Kidd   Getting a John Wall type prospect is amazing tho so you should be excited to draft him
"all are in the top 10 of worst contracts in the NBA along with John Wall,  Kevin Love, and Rudy Gobert"
"I don't think he has the *best*, but, I think John Wall is up there"
one overlooked part of beal is he is very good off-ball. only recently has his ball handling and driving improved to the point where he is running the offense. back in the john wall days he was used exclusively as a shooter running off screens and spotting up in transition
John wall retired?
Technically John Wall since I wouldn't exactly say he's in his prime anymore unfortunately
Because one is Kevin Durant and the other is John Wall?
"honestly, is this a little messed up to say? to John Wall? I would say someone is ""as good a teammate as I've ever had"" if I was paired up with another star for as long as Beal and Wall were, provided there wasn't any obvious detriments from Wall during that time."
KD came back to the league fresh off an Achilles tear and asserted dominance like nothing happened. Wall is playin ok at best in my opinion. Also yea hyped himself up too much with the whole “y’all gonna get a Wall you haven’t gotten the chance to see” monologue. And plays pretty good at best. No ones freaking out over John Wall really. That’s just my opinion though.
"They both got surgery.  Whether its for a partial or a full tear, the achilles surgery and healing process is the same.  But OP is acting like John Wall getting 20/6 on a lottery team is the same as John Wall getting 20/10 on a playoff team."
Because John Wall on the Rockets is irrelevant.
Might as well float John Wall out there too.
Oh no.  John Wall doesnt deserve this.  Please get that man some help dont just remove every single good player leaving him with nothing
You for real? John Wall is so washed lmao
"Because Durant is a top 3 all time scorer who can do it all and John Wall, although a very good player, is not in Durant's league."
Because KD is a HOF lock and generational player and John Wall is a good player?  Even outside of the Rockets record of course Durant is going to get more attention.
"The argument is that Ben Simmons is probably going to be better than whoever you draft with the Nets picks. Even if he’s not going to be the outright best player on a championship team, the players you draft with the Nets picks most likely won’t be either.  Making roster decisions around a 30 year John Wall isn’t how you want to build your roster."
Because one of the two players is a former Warrior playing with two of the most polarizing players in the NBA on one of the biggest markets and the other guy is John Wall.
"&gt;Also really? Saying stfu over a civil discussion? No wonder no one can take you seriously.  Oh sorry, don't take me serious. And it isn't all that civil, you're uncivilized at arguing points. You want me to do all the hard work to jump through a thousand hoops to prove to your moving goalposts that Westbrook's got flaws. Your head's up your ass and youre trash. There's no civility in your discourse.   Oh look, more tasks for me to prove things your willfully ignorant ass can't acknowledge.  &gt; Also the other players listed aren't portrayed in the media as such, and are not viewed by the general watching public as such, and **I dare you** to find articles that show them in an ""combative"" light aside from Draymond.   https://www.sbnation.com/2018/10/30/18039814/washington-wizards-drama-john-wall-bradley-beal-history    and more, if youre a Wizards fan and your head isn't in the sand then you know   &gt;Talking to media about wanting to get traded, refusing to play when he didn't get traded, complaining to the coach about not getting minutes and not starting over Westbrook (who was already an all-star), beefing with teammates about rotations and how he deserves more minutes over them, you can read about it online.  Yeah? Prove each point with articles. I dArE yOu"
"I love John Wall and I hope we can build a squad around him and Christian Wood, I'd hate it if we trade him before we see what that pair is truly capable of"
yeah players are easily forgotten if their peak is short  there's a reason john wall is pulling a top 5 salary ($40M) in the league and it's not because he was a scrub
"Have a looksie at his TS% compared to league average instead of his career, then consider that he can't defend anymore either and note that his assists are well down from where they used to be. Getting John Wall is a good way to guarantee a team won't contend"
"He has been good, borderline All Star, but he is not John Wall of the Wizards... I guess that's why."
John wall is easier to forget. KD won some rings and came back early from injury to try to get that 3 peat and then injured his achilles in the process. Plus KD was just always a better player. Wall was gone so long it's like we forgot how good he even even was at his apex.
"Yeah, I feel that. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of John Wall when he was killing it in Washington either, but I'm very impressed with his bounce back after not playing for like 2 years. I guess it's just because even though he's putting up really good numbers, the Rockets are still 14th in the west while KD's Nets are 2nd in the east. Maybe if the Rockets were at least in the playoff race then maybe he might be getting some buzz. Hopefully they can find him some help next season though."
"And he's asking for you to give a specific instance, with the Thunder organization, of another player who acted like Reggie did during the whole debacle.  Don't bring out a strawman argument, while referencing Russ ""leading the league in techs"" (11) like that's some metric for his attitude  as a player. In the top 5 spots there's also Draymond Green (9), Dwight Howard (8), Devin Booker (8), and John Wall (7), but none of those players (aside from maybe Draymond) would be considered ""petty"" or argumentative.  Russ has a hot head with certain rivalries (Wall and Dame in particular), but nowhere near as bad as you are portraying it to be."
"OP may be saying that but that isn’t true whatsoever.  He was probably a top 3, 100% a top 5 PG before his injury.  I’m not even sure if he’s top 10 now. His stats may be ok (not really even that great), but he just hasn’t been amazing this year. I’m not saying he has sucked, but he is no where near pre injury John Wall."
ESPN and SportsCenter: Bradley Beal HATES John Wall?!
John Wall CHOOSES to watch Wizards games. No one from the Wizards will ever throw shade at Wall 🗣
John wall / James harden
John Wall has left the chat
"Because folks don’t want to admit they were wrong about John Wall, people have been convinced that he’d be a shell of himself. Sure he’s a guy that’s always relied on athleticism but he has always been a passing guard (you can’t teach ball movement and vision and it doesn’t rely on athleticism), couple years off to continue work on offensive moves - he was going to be fine barring re injury. You think people on the internet willingly admit to being wrong?"
John Wall gone cry in the car
Me: No one would take this as John Wall shade.  Next highest voted comment: John Wall in shambles.
John ‘BIG Bs BITCH’ Wall ain’t worried.
John Wall in shambles
"KD was widely viewed as the 2nd best player in the league after Lebron when he got hurt. John Wall had questions about his value even before getting the achilles injury. I believe he can still be an all-star level dude who can be part of a competitive team, but I wouldn't bet money on it. At the same time, I just assumed KD would be fine and Brooklyn would be good because of it. Maybe it's just perception and nothing else, but the perception around the league of each dude was very different even before the injuries."
John wall crying in the club rn
So it's not John wall?
"Why? Maybe John Wall is #2, whos to say its bad being behind Westbrook? If Beal had said Gortat is his 2nd best teammate, then only then JW should retire."
Why would Tillman Fertitta do this!? I was so happy for John Wall reuniting with Cousins.  And now this.
Cowherd: Are Beal’s comments reflective of the fact John Wall didn’t have a father figure in his life?
*Sad John Wall noises
John wall didn’t like that...
I agree with you that it's remarkable I'm just listing reasons on why any potential praise of John Wall could be buried.
This seems like a pretty John Wall statline but he’s surprisingly shooting well from 3 now
John Wall gonna average 24 on 41/25/80 shooting playing every other game 😤
"Wizards thought Beal + Westbrook &gt; Beal + returning from injury Wall  Rockets thought Flyer on John Wall returning from injury &gt; Westbrook  Rockets also probably knew Harden was going to be traded, so they figured they'd try to get something for Westbrook. They might've figured Wall would be easier to trade for pieces than Westbrook, + they got a protected 1st round pick out of it, which is useful as they soft-rebuild post-Harden.  Wizards want to show Beal that they're not throwing in the towel so that he hopefully stays with them. Wizards have also looked pretty good their last few games, and in a very turbulent Eastern conference, there's a decent chance they make the playoffs."
FSN: How do Beal's comments on John Wall affect LeBron and his legacy?
John Wall down horrendous
John Wall punching the air right now.
See y’all are in here making jokes about ESPN and “is this a shot at John Wall” but where does ESPN get the use for it?🤔
"The John Wall Beal's played with is better than Westbrook this season.   Hell, John Wall this season is more efficient than Westbrook, especially from 3."
Espn: is there bad blood between bradley beal and John Wall?
Russ is clearly better than John Wall
"John Wall: ""I thought what we had was SPECIAL!"""
John Wall + Westbrook
ESPN: Bradley Beal reveals John Wall is one of the worst teammates he ever had.
John wall in shambles
"Would the wizards have beaten the hawks in the 2015 ECSF if John Wall were to not break his hand?  If yes, would the wizards have beaten the injured cavs in the ECF and advanced to the NBA Finals?  If yes, would the wizards have at least won one game vs the Warriors in the finals?"
"John Wall is the fourth highest paid player in the NBA, at $41,250,000 this year.  After a horrific leg injury that took him out for two seasons, Wall hasn't fully returned to form- while he has decent numbers, his efficiency stats (metrics that determine how effective a player's impact really is) are poor because he isn't a good shooter or an especially good defender."
John Wall?
"Otto porter, Russell Westbrook, kevin love, formerly Blake griffin, John wall, kemba walker, and Andre Drummond  would be a good place to start."
What in the flying fuck is that group lmao.  How big are your groups if you have Charles Barkley and John Wall in the same group haha ha
John Wall
I miss gang sign John Wall.
But John Wall run fast.
"&gt; D-will, Rondo, John wall, Arenas  Stockton played with a bunch of guys on that skill level as well. You are hyping up guys that you are more familiar with when 80s and 90s had guys just as good as those guys as well lol"
We would play this song at the student section of every sports game my senior year of high school and everyone would be doing the John Wall. Amazing times lol
"John Wall, Kemba Walker, Chandler Parsons - all much worse contracts than CP3."
"The John Wall, not the Dougie - yes"
"I feel like John Wall has been making $40mil+ for the last 5 seasons, and also hasn't played for the last 5 seasons..."
John Wall invented bicep flexion. Before that everyone's arms just hung there like idiots.
"The thing I never understood was the viewpoint Paul was worthless.  His contract is only bad if you place him in a backcourt with ball dominant guards.  If you put him on a team that has a off ball shooters and a future All NBA center you are getting your full money’s worth.  He also happened to be their best back court defender when he was on the Rockets and was the reason they mad it as far as they did in the playoffs for several years.    But sure, go with Westbrook and then John Wall. A guy who is coming off an absolutely devastating injury who relies almost entirely on his physical ability. They just keep searching for worse off situations.   They really messed things up over the past several years."
Had you seen someone do the John Wall before John Wall did the John Wall?  I think not.
John Wall???
Remember when Nephews also thought that John Wall was gonna come in after 2 years and be better than Westbrook?
"I completely forgot John Wall existed, let alone played for the Rockets lol"
"&gt; he effectively traded it for a contract that is CLEARLY worse (and for longer terms) in John Wall’s.  I swear I'm not being one of those Wall stans but, to be fair, nobody knew what Wall was going to look like coming back. I think it was more that the Rockets could DEFINITELY have gotten more for the Russ-Wall trade. We somehow moved on from Wall by only giving them one extremely protected 1st round pick."
"He played Magic and Isiah from like 84-91. Then they were gone. Penny was getting destroyed by injuries after 4 years. Nash wasn't playing even close to an all time great level until like year 6.  So really it was Magic and IT in the 80s, and GP, Hardaway, Kevin Johnson who's worth mentioning I think, and Kidd in the 90s with a few yrs of Penny too.  So like 5 or 6 all time point guards from the 80s and 90s he played? While CP3 played Nash, Kidd, Billups, Tony Parker, Russ, Lillard, Kyrie, Curry. And D-will, Rondo, John wall, Arenas, all had some rlly good years too. It's just at another level compared to the 80s and 90s"
not gonna lie john wall has the cleanest dougie i've ever seen
"look at John Wall man, so inspirational"
[John Wall looking at that player option like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/423/cover5.jpg)
John Wall also is also the GOAT of having a song written about a dance move he created and named after himself.
"Chris Paul = no record of Dougie abilities  John Wall = history of Dougie-ing, possibility of future Dougie  that alone is worth 91m imo"
"He saw John Wall in the air ready to block, literally threw himself at Wall's legs. Nearly flipped Wall on his head. The landing was bad, and the slow mo replay made it look really deliberate.  Those elbow-chin checks during screens he did for IT during that playoff run.  And he almost did the same thing to Robin Lopez that he did to Love by literally hooking under the armpit and pulling down. Lopez looked pissed, but didnt get hurt."
John Wall &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chris Paul &amp; Harden
Everyone mentioning ya Westbrooks ya Demars.  I doubt Nikola Vuvecic will get booed in Orlando  Not too sure bout this one but you would assume John Wall would get good apprials in wash
"You're confused. Westbrook was traded to the Wizards for John Wall. It's not Westbrook on the '21 Suns vs Paul on the '21 Wizards, but Westbrook on the '20 Thunder vs Paul on the '20 Rockets."
Yall had john wall and bradley and still couldn't get past the 1st round🤷‍♂️
Right now it has to be John Wall
And John Wall.
Kyries 2016 finals numbers were phenomenal. I’m just trying to say that he’s stepped up on the biggest stage. I have him as last on my list but people are acting like it’s outrageous to put him in the same tier as these guys. It’s obviously opinion but it’s not like he’s John wall lol
"To be clear Beal is currently one of the worst defenders in the league because of the massive offensive load he carries. If you look at his early years in the league like 13-16 ish you see a guy who plays second fiddle to John Wall and puts in more energy on defense. That talent doesn't just go away, he just decides that the energy is more valuable on offense. Specifically if you go back and watch the Hawks vs Wizards 2nd round series in 2015 you will see Beals amazing prevent defense. Korver absolutely killed every defender with off ball movement that year but Beal shut him down all series."
reminiscent of John Wall tearing his achilles by slipping and falling in his own home after already being out
"I don't think you'd be in that category in that case.  If I'm interpreting it right, a good example would be a LeBron fan who's not a fan of any team. He just likes wherever LeBron is.  But if the person is a Cavs fan but still also roots for LeBron (like you with wizards and John Wall), then they are fine"
"I'd say JC is a better overall player potential wise, but you need to put him in the right situation to draw it out. He's capable of playing a lot like John Wall/WB."
"How so? I'm a Wizards fan, but I'll also root for John Wall wherever he goes."
Someone post the John Wall GIF please.
"i know...there's a little overlap between the word ""wing"" and the word ""guard"", but John Wall has always been specifically a point guard, and point guards never have been under the category of ""wing"""
"Nah what he’s saying is the players agreed to it, NBA players have more control over their league than any other professional sports league.  This league money that you refer to is given out to NBA players at a higher proportion than any other league.. the more money the league makes the higher the salary cap goes.. this is why John Wall makes 40M and trash players like Andrew Wiggins get max deals making &gt;30M a year."
"nope. if they draft a wing, like for example Jalen Green, Rockets could run a lineup like: John Wall at point guard, KPJ at shooting guard, Jalen Green at small forward. Green would be starting alongside Wall and KPJ, not coming off the bench behind them"
"since when was John Wall a wing, he's always been a pg right? unless something changed this past season in houston, i admittedly haven't watched many rockets games"
That’s a big IF. John Wall is the ultimate tank commander   He loves his shots.  I hope Green gets enough shots to win ROTY tho
Rockets for sure  Harden/Howard  Harden-CP3-Capela  Harden-Westbrook-Covington  John Wall-Oladipo-Wood  KPJ-Green-Wood (hopefully)
I keep on forgetting about John Wall lol
"Paul Millsap is a good one, so is John Wall. Dlo, Vucevic, Luka, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, KAT unless he really turns his career around, Iggy shouldn't make it IMO but he might."
"i know this is probably a troll job on his wikipedia page, but major john wall energy here lol  ""On June 29, 2021, it was reported that Collins had somehow managed to re-fracture his foot despite not participating in basketball activities for over 6 months, seemingly from walking to the mailbox."""
"I'm not gonna go for the biggest ones like Kobe or TD      John Wall and now Beal for Washington comes in mind for sure, Boogie in Sacramento was massive. Dame and CJ in Portland for sure as well, Donovan embracing Utah as well.      There a lot more but these are the few that came into my mind first"
"Because Blake Griffin's buyout was part of a mutual deal between Griffin and the Pistons. Griffin could have chosen to sit on the bench and taken the remainder of his contract.   On the other hand, you have a John Wall-type situation where there is no way Wall is going to ask to be released from his massive contract. So if a team is obligated to pay for a player, why shouldn't that player be obligated to play for that team."
I always saw the Blazers like a mirror of the Wizards with John Wall and Bradley Beal. Both with fantastic point guards and with shooting guards that can easily pick up the slack and can even be the number one option. But always seem to be never good enough.  Both teams also mirrored the Raptors when it was run by Derozan and Lowry.  The might also need a new HC and to trade one of their guards to really make things work.
God bless you for shilling John Wall
Kennard is probably gonna get packaged with their second round picks to get Westbrook/Kemba/John Wall to make the salaries match  Ibaka has been hurt  Pat Bev isn't that good on a team where Kawhi needs spacing more than anything
Yes. I said he is John Wall with a better shot.
"Damian Lillard, Dillon Brooks, John Wall"
John Wall
"Every time Ja flies up in traffic I hold my breath. When you think of the Rose, the John Wall, the Jamal of it all - makes Westbrook even more impressive that he never got hurt"
John wall for sure
John Wall can't play off the ball.
&gt;I think prior to this year the easy answer was James Harden  TIL: James Harden + CP3 &lt; Dame + CJ  or  John Wall + Bradley Beal
Nobody is arguing that. If it’s just the 2017 backcourt it’s not even top 10. But a 2017 John Wall who put up 23/11 and then 27/10 in the playoffs with a Bradley Beal scoring 32 a game is better than Dame/CJ and current Russ/Beal
Read the comment - he literally said if your put peak wall and current Beal. John Wall in 2017 averaged 27/10 in the playoffs. Russ just shot 33/25/80 from the floor in the playoffs.
John wall in 2017 wasn't better than Current Russ and Beal wasn't nearly as good back then compared to now
"John Wall and Kevin Love are in a tier of their own. Both barely play and when they do just aren't that good anymore.   Westbrook is certainly overpaid right now but in the regular season he can still get you some wins, Wizards don't make the playoffs if they have Wall instead of Westbrook. He also gets people in the seats which counts for something.   Porzingas barely plays and is now just a 7'3 SG lmao.   Kemba has been pretty bad after his injury.   Hayward played well this year but it's not a coincidence he's injured again, he's injury prone and that contract may age like milk.  Klay has missed half of his contracts life and while we expect him to be good again, he suffered 2 major injuries and may not be the same."
John Wall in 2017 was better than Westbrook this year so yes better than Westbrook/Beal  Dame and CJ are an overrated backcourt because they are instant defensive liability. CJ is not an all star level player. Prime Wall with this season Beal is better.  CP3 and Booker might be better.
John Wall sends his regards.
"Al horford, Russell Westbrook, Christopher Paul, John Wall."
“Peak John Wall” was 23/4/11 on .541 ts%. Is that even better than current Westbrook?
KP for John Wall?   Fuck I don’t even know if I want KP lol
"We love Ryan Anderson  Mavs send KP and we will give you John Wall, just get good medical team and load manage him and you should be fine"
"Who would you prefer out of Kemba, Westbrook, John Wall"
Trade for John Wall
they should try to get westbrook or john wall tbh
The clippers need John Wall 💪💪
I dunno but if John Wall can be moved then so can KP
Yeh idk how he feels either but John wall was my fav player
John Wall beat the Bulls with no Rose. Sure you could say John Wall outclass the Bulls then but Lebron beat the Bulls in the conference finals with MVP Rose. It’s a huge difference.
"Bro, seriously did you start watching NBA basketball a month ago? Bradley Beal has ***never*** been very good at defense, that's always been the case-even back in college when he played for Florida. He doesn't have a much higher defensive rating than Steph Curry or even Tobias Harris, for that matter. Beal's game is based on putting up points and, to a lesser extent, facilitating. Hell, even on our own teams, John Wall in his prime was a floor raiser, but Beal is too 1 dimensional of a player to do so. Look at our roster, aside from Beal and Russ, it's legitimately AWFUL (I'm including young guys like Gafford and Rui who still need a lot of development to be consistent starters). If the Sixers lost a game to us with fucking Scott Brooks coaching, that's a BAD sign for you guys. Ball don't lie so please think of this conversation when you watch your team getting bounced this playoffs, I'll be here to say ""I told you so."""
You said Lebron was reason thibs lost in Chicago but didn’t John wall and the wizards outclass his bulls teams also?
Not John wall?
I want John wall back
"He *played for* the Knicks  Like, he was on the all rookie first team with Blake Griffin, John Wall, and Demarcus Cousins, this isn't some obscure name lol."
"&gt; Porzingis, K Love, John Wall, De’Angelo Russell  Horford too. And that's just another one off the top of my head."
"&gt;worst contract in the league (Kemba)  Porzingis, K Love, John Wall, De’Angelo Russell  &gt;a terrible bench  Bench is fine just that when we don’t have Kemba, Rob Will, and Jaylen playing it ends up looking a lot worse because bench warmers need to play minutes.  &gt;an all star who won’t be good as Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis over the next few years  We have two All-Stars and Jayson is pretty clearly a future MVP that we have signed for 5 years. Jaylen is also incredible and him not being as good as 4 MVP favorite caliber players isn’t really an issue at all."

Cowherd said John Wall shamed himself by having fun and dancing as a rookie because he didn't have a dad.  After his dad died from cancer when he was 8.
It is interesting to see how quickly things change. PGs kind of feel like NFL Rbs. You can be top 5 for a few years and then immediately fall off a cliff.   John Wall put up all star season of 23/10/5/2/1 at age 26. But at 30 hes been called a corpse for several years now.   Derrick Rose MVP. Up and down off random benches.
John Wall is making 41 million
Cowherd said something far more racially tinged about John Wall and not having a fathrt
John Wall got traded when he hadn't played in forever and was getting paid more money. Kemba can be moved
"John Wall got paid 41 mil this year  Blake Griffin got paid 34 mil for this year prior to his buyout  Kevin Love 31 mil  Drummond 30 mil prior to buy out  Porzingis 29.5 mil  hell, Otto Porter got paid 28.5 mil this year"
1. Kevin Love   2. John Wall   3. Kemba   4. Porzingis   5. Westbrook
john wall
Never heard of John Wall?
John wall by a landslide  Edit: or a shower slide
Nah it’s still John Wall
"Oh, wow I forgot about that. I was thinking about when Cowherd made a similar comment about John Wall. I think it was because he did the Dougie during a game or something. Talking heads are fucking wierdos"
"As the great John Wall once said, ""Fuck is wrong with you, boy!?"""
"John Wall from the Rockets might be a worthwhile deal, but that's mostly because I just want to see John Wall in Portland."
"Do John Wall, Kevin Love, and Kemba count?"
john Wall
Nah John Wall better
Well Amares legs were worn out which is why the Suns didn’t want him.  Wizards gave a hurt John Wall that money   Allan Houston was pretty good most of his time with the Knicks. Those were some crappy teams   Deng/Mozgov were jokes as soon as they signed
ehhh... you cherry picked the single worst example of a team not paying a player...  how many years did the Amare contract set the Knicks back?   how many years did the John Wall contract set the Wizards back?   Allen Houston on the Knicks?   fucking Deng/Mozgov on the Lakers?   The list goes on and on and on and on and on...
You can easily move him + picks for Al Horford. You can trade for John Wall and gamble it will be better. You can probably do trades for several other players as well just depends on how many picks you want to give away. Want Kevin Love?   Personally I think Kemba and Picks for Kyle Lowry is your best move. Have the Raptors do a sign and trade for 2y/ 65 million contract with Lowry and send Kemba and 2 lottery protected firsts
"Honestly? You'd have to take back John Wall, Westbrook, or Porzingis. Also maybe Horford"
If John wall can get moved Kemba probably can too might take sometime though
"If you’ve only watched him against the Jazz, you should probably take the Grizzlies fans word for it.  Realistically, how is a player supposed to pass? By not attacking and just passing to whoever. The penetration is part of being a legitimate playmaker. He award looking to set up his teammates unless he’s getting all the way to the rim. Only takes open 3s.   Pretty much like John Wall"
"I couldnt watch john wall play, but I always thought that John wall had elite straightline speed, i dont know if he had elite acceleration or elite change of direction."
Ja Morant is way more John Wall than any of the other athletic point guards. A genuine pass first with elite speed and has his own creative passing style.
"Huh, I forgot Flip coached you guys. I seriously thought Eddie Jordan coached John Wall. Man, my late 2000s to early 2010s sports memories are spotty as hell."
"Kyrie Irving... Lakers fan in London so I used to catch the trash early East coast games when young players on bad teams would Duke it out. Caught a lot of young Kyrie and John Wall and as much as the Cavs weren’t winning, man is he fun to watch. I’ve had to route against him a lot with my anti Lebron bias and obvious anti Celtics bias but he’s really an artist on the court.  While routing against him, I’ve developed an affinity for Curry and Lillard."
Thought John Wall would be the GOAT PG
I hate Skip as much as anyone but as a point of order it was Colin Cowherd with that trash ass John Wall take.
Mavs with John Wall sounds a lot better than Mavs with KP  Wall’s contract is also two years shorter
John Wall punching the air rn
"A clean slate for the next 5 years  They have that terrible John Wall contract, they don’t need another"
"Not only did John Wall become a professional basketball player while growing up without a father figure, his ability to do the Dougie better than anyone else on this planet is a better accomplishment than anything Colin has done."
Coincidentally Colin cowherd also attacked John wall for not having a father figure in 2010
"Probably D Wade tbh, who he played with. Then maybe.... Bosh?  Paul George? John Wall? Demar Derozan?  You're not wrong."
John wall and Hayward
"John Wall slapped him in the face, Perkins dropped him with a hard screen, Elfrid Payton shoved him to the ground, for a dude that could ""beat up 95% of the league"" 99% of the league is not scared of him and more often than not usually gets the better of him in these dust ups lol"
Honestly 4 unprotected and 4 pick swaps. Throw in a couple seconds? I think that’s pretty fair for John wall/tank commander
How many picks would you package with Tatum to get John Wall?
Oh hey John Wall
"He’s not overpaid though...who the hell is signing with the Hornets in free agency. Maybe in a couple years when Melo starts to really shine but the Hornets weren’t getting anybody better for that price, it’s not like he’s on a John Wall contract either. He’s very important for the teams success moving forward in terms of helping them make the playoffs and getting Melo that early playoff experience. By the time Hayward’s contract is up, so will Lamelo’s and the Hornets should be able to sign a big free agent so I really don’t see how it’s a bad contract..."
"PG: John Wall SG: Buddy Hield SF: Andrew Wiggins PF: Kevin Love C: Stephen Adams  Wall and Love are self explanatory.   Buddy has a long contract with a big dollar amount and so far has come up short of earning it. Sacramento has guys they will need to pay and will want to have space to add pieces as their young guys grow. With Hield underperforming, that will be tough.  Wiggins isn’t terrible and gives GS a lot on D. Still, he’s not a star and he uses a lot of cap space on a team trying to contend. Based on situation, he’s the worst. There’s an argument for Hayward based on his health track record over the past several seasons.   Adams is kind of similar. He’s a good, overpaid player whose long term contract with a lot owed will make it tough for the Pelicans to build around their young guys and win in the West. Horford is also a candidate, but his contract isn’t hurting the Thunder much."
"John Wall, Giannis, D. Rose..."
Damn it’s John Wall
"Beal took the money, he was a free agent.  He wanted to be the man without John Wall, didn’t realize John Wall was actually a good PG getting this team to the playoffs every year. Everyone wants to be the man until they find out it’s too hard"
"I've been watching the NBA forever 50 years unfortunately has a bullets wizards fan.  I'd have to disagree with you about free third disparity meaning nothing.  Certain players and I think this is inarguable get far more free throws in anyone else. James Harden isn't my mind the best example or the worst example of this.  He drives a lane throws his head back and a foul is called.  He's been doing this from his earliest days in the league with Oklahoma City, And it's got more pronounced and now the refs just give it to him.  Michael Jordan got more fouls than anyone else.  Shaquille O'Neal who was pounded more immersively than any player I've ever seen got far fewer free throws and he was a bad free throw shooter too.  Has a bullets and wizards man I will tell you that Alvin Hayes got a lot of foul calls and he shot a fall away but he had that same little quirk that James Harden did a falling back or throwing his head back as if he had been struck.  Early in his career Michael Jordan did not get a lot of fouls called but Phil Jackson put together two years worth of tapes and sent them to the NBA offices showing all the times Jordan had been hit and didn't get the calls and from that day forward he led the league in free throws.   In my case watching wizard games the last six seven years Bradley Beal and John Wall continuing excessively drove the lane contact was evident yet frequently no fouls were called.  One of the other unseen and important issues with the referees calling more fouls for one team in the other is a diminishes the depth of the team that is getting called for more fouls.  You wind up sitting important players because they picked up two or three fouls early.  This year because several veteran referees retired and because there was a covered out break among referees ( you should read up on this), more younger referees were called up from the minor leagues ( G league,etc.  More than 7 right now).  The difference in the speed and the size of players in the NBA and those in the minor leagues is not unlike the difference between professional baseball and hockey minor leagues.  This has been the worst year for referring I've ever seen.  It was interesting to watch the playoffs last year in the bubble when they had the same veteran cruise working all the games and it was some of the best and cleanest basketball you'll ever see, professionally."
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
Thats funny coming from a wizards fan paying John wall 40 million how many years for playing no games
Except John Wall makes $92 million over the next two years. That’s the worst contract in the league.
"Can I interest you in a slightly used John Wall to be your second ""star""? lol"
You're right. People are forgetting how many trades have gone down featuring players people couldn't see getting traded. Did anyone see John wall and Westbrook being swapped? Who saw anyone taking Wiggins out if Minnesota? All it has to take is a disgruntled player on a similar contract to trade PG. And there has been someone like that every off-season for a few years now.
Dude shouldve threw up some gang signs like John Wall and Demar Derozan do sometimes
"that's just for healing the ACL.  even if we assume the ACL is a non-issue the concern is the achilles.  the achilles was torn late last november, and that's the injury that won't have had much time to heal.  i don't remember how long john wall had, but KD essentially had 18 months to heal from his achilles tear.  klay won't even have a year before the start of the season."
"i don't know if all achilles injuries are equal or if there are more or less severe ones, but he's going to have much less time to recover compared to either john wall or kd.  but I'm sure he'll get really good at shooting standing threes in the meantime?"
"Watching the Clips gives me flashbacks to the worst John Wall days in 2018 &amp; 2019, when he was playing with bone spurs and had less than zero interest in playing defense.    He would make the laziest, softest switches imaginable, over and over and over.  The screener just had to move in his general direction and Wall would make an 'anticipatory switch.'    Just like those 2018 Wizards, the Clippers have been doing that lazy shit all season in order to placate their two stars, and now they get to the playoffs and wonder why they're getting spit-roasted."
"Not really. Being African-American myself, I've heard about Civil Rights Movement &amp; Martin Luther King Jr. and slavery damn near every year in school, but absolutely nothing about the [Tuskeegee Syphilis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study) or [Black Wall Street and the Tulsa Race Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre) has ever been mentioned even when I've had African-American history teachers and I didn't even know about them until being a full-grown adult seeing it mentioned on Reddit or hearing it in John Oliver's segment on US History.  There are a lot of lies by omission in history classes in the US."
"Thinking a guy is overrated means I hate my own team? Nice  &gt; y’all will be worse than before John Wall  Considering we’d still have our best player, we wouldn’t be special but we’d be hovering around 30 wins."
"I think you’re a loser who hates his own team. When Westbrook leaves, y’all will be worse than before John Wall. Hope you are ready for more tanking."
He went at John wall that one year. And I thought he was good in the bubble
John Wall HS mixtape though...
He’s always had those issues it’s never skill it’s the emotion vs emotional thing. I wish he would understand that those moments due nothing but hurt the team. Bad body language etc John wall and hardaway were called out for it previously hardaway definitely changed not sure about wall.
"Reminds me of that time some old guy grabbed a players ass as he fell into the stands, think it was John Wall? Cant remember for certain"
"LBJ left Clev (who in his defense didn't look like they were going to build quality pieces around him) and joined the Heat, where he was playing alongside a top 3 SG at the time and an All-Star Chris Bosh. He was then severely overconfident in his ""not 1, 2,3"" statement.  Melo, if I'm not mistaken, though he wanted out of Denver he did what he could to ensure they would get decent assets backed but none were going to be as good as Melo at the time, it's just fans being Terrible people.  KD literally joined the team that beat him in the playoffs after being up 3-1, and they were 73-9. Who were up 3-1, but several factors and Curry's worse play made them lose.  Harden - Has had the Rockets cater to him, the offensive scheme was completely built for him. He had them trade for CP3, Westbrook, and acquired John Wall after Westbrook trade. He gave up on the team after 8 games.   Gordon Hayward was with the Jazz for 7 years. He was a first time all-star and saw his chance to get money and compete for a ring, what's crazy, is that Celtics team took the Cavs to 7 without him and Kyrie. I don't know if they repeat that, but they were definitely good on paper. He's then dealt with injuries since then and was dealt to Charlotte."
"idk i feel like some of the players could definitely scrap, i'd love to see john wall get into it with someone spitting on him for instance"
"Meh I think it's way scarier when it's someone that actually gets the ball at the perimeter a lot.  Shaq changing his game from straight paint domination would be weird.  The 3 scariest I can think of are Giannis, Russ, and Magic Johnson. Even someone like John Wall would be absurd.  Players that dominate and have the ball in the position to shoot a 3 a lot but don't because they suck at it.  Or just give it to someone like Lebron or Luka. Even though they aren't bums for 3 it'd be stupid if they could shoot like Steph."
I get why some of my Wizard-fan friends were sad to see John Wall go. But even the biggest doubters amongst them are starting to come around
They need to trade Morris and Beverley for John Wall.
Remember people actually said that the Wizards would be better off with Russ on the bench 💀 and that John Wall was/is better than him ⚰️
It feels like John wall emptied the clip the first 3 quarters
John Wall looks great
john wall is good
Why is Houston not doing good this season? They still got John Wall
"Houston proposes a point guard swap, John Wall for Luka straight up"
"Exactly my point. MVP caliber guys don’t win MVPs, even some guys in the top 10 All time only have 1.   John Wall is a 1 time 3rd All-NBA guy. He was never close to an MVP even prior to injury"
"I think Marcin Gortat + John Wall used to have similar actions to help wall get to the rim, but it seems to have gotten a lot more common once Boston/Theis were trying for it most pick and roll actions."
Not really john wall is a way way better playmaker they are both quite different
"No, unlikely he would have won one. I think he had the tools, his shot was the big thing stopping him from that next level. He wasn't very efficient at all.   BUT, I think people in this thread are being too dismissive. Wall wasn't far off from being a top 10 player. The year before his first injury that ultimately led to him missing a whole season he averaged 23/11/4 with 2 steals. That team nearly went to the conference finals.  If he doesn't get injured, Beal keeps growing into something like the beast he is now, they continue to make runs near the conference finals, and he developed his shot a bit (Small sample and all, but the year he got that first injury he was shooting 37% on near career high volume) I don't think it's crazy at all to think it was possible.  People itt seem to only be remembering John Wall who played 41, then 32 games before missing a year. Not actual good john wall."
I feel bad for both Silas and John Wall this season honestly. Wall has exceeded expectations imo and gets put on a pretty terrible team while Silas finally gets a shot and has to deal with the Harden bullshit. I don't usually mind shitting on Houston but those 2 don't deserve it.
hoping for HOU where he can play with wood and kpj while being mentored by john wall.
"I thought the Jazz would be a big contender this season - #1 seed, looking good.  I thought the Knicks could win 30 games and be in the hunt for the play-in at least - Didn't expect this lmao. Exceeding expectations so far  I thought Rockets would be a playoff team, and John Wall would have a decent comeback - Uhm"
John Wall.
"Yeah.. for other terrible contracts lmao.  People said Russ and John wall were untradeable and they were swapped for eachother.  Dlo was an “””all-star”””(third injury replacement) who many said had a terrible contract, Wiggins had to be attached to two lottery picks to make that work.  Then you have to take into account all of the buy outs on terrible deals that you’re ignoring like Drummond, Blake, LMA."
"If John wall can get traded, anyone can get traded"
"I mean, Klay being a GSW legend doesn't erase the fact that his contract is absolutely horrible moving forward. Dude who ain't play in 2.5 years by the time next season begins is gonna be making 40m a year. That's some John Wall shit"
John wall got traded Chris Paul got traded if they try and trade him he’ll get traded
John Wall works a lot with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society   Russell Westbrook and his Why Not? Foundation helps out a lot of foster kids  Karl Malone volunteers at my old middle school   Dikembe Mutombo does so much charity in Congo that he was recognized by the UN
"Bradley Beal being 6'3, I always thought he was 6'5. Even in pictures standing next to John Wall he looked noticeably taller, but maybe that was because he was closer to  the camera. He definitely plays bigger than what he actually is."

John Wall is a Legend?
"Do his 38/22/69 shooting splits and 5 TOs really bolster that argument? I mean I’m a Wiz fan. Im used to setting the bar pretty low and even I’m disappointed.    But go look at my top comment of all time. It’s literally talking about how I was in favor of trading Wall for Russ.    &gt;	Still crying about John being gone   You know Wall, our franchise player for a decade, was just traded like 2 months ago right? This isn’t like an OKC fan still crying about Harden being traded lmao. It’s like it was Dame traded and Portland fans were upset (albeit Dame is obviously better than Wall).    So continue talking out of your ass lol. I’m over your backpedaling. Buhbye."
"Damn, I don't know who to thank, the wiz or john wall for the trade?"
yeah DeJounte took off and blew by three clippers like he was John Wall yesterday. it might take the next year to get his legs back under him but he'll still be improving and probably working on his shot behind the scenes. he might come back even better.
John Wall is a God
I haven't seen this talked about but John Wall looks really good. I think the Wizards fucked up trading him. He can still get to the rim at will.
"John Wall looks a lot like he used to.  Boogie Cousins, sadly, does not..."
What are you crying about? John wall came back after not playing for two years dealing with major injuries and infections. Everyone said he was washed. He showed out against the kings and then peeps said let him do this against a good team. So he balled out against a good team. That okay with you?
John wall honestly looked fucking amazing. If Harden can get back to form and Wood comes back so we can gel we should be ok.
John Wall looked amazing out there
Love John Wall
Westbrook has such piss poor bball IQ. I miss John Wall more and more everyday.
i miss john wall
"John Wall has literally never been better than Westbrook, maybe that changes this season but up until now that has never been the case."
John Wall is better than westbrook what point r u trying to make?
John Wall.
"I wonder when it will be too much for Beal, he's their new John Wall. Whenever he gets out I hope he's still healthy and productive, what a motor man."
"John Wall look good tho rite now.   And the Dubs are starting to get Wiggins the ball in spots he can do work. Dray is feeding him the rock after good defensive possessions. Let him spend a full season with that team, I bet he isn't on the list anymore. He'll still be overpaid, but he'll be a smarter defender, a more confident playmaker, and he'll grasp how to be a better scorer. Those are some savvy cats running things on that squad. Already we are seeing him assert himself as a playmaker, his passing against the Kings was fun to watch."
"I said off hand, Mike Conley only has this year left. Gary Harris is like a 5 million dollar player now making 20, John Wall is way better than all of them. wiggins was probably 6th in my mind."
"John wall and mike Conley are worse players and making very close in money. They’re definitely a close second, if not worse"
"But mike conleys making more money than Dlo. Are you saying mike Conley is better than danglo russell? Also, why is Gary Harris here over John wall or wiggins"
"you can have an opinion. I'd love to see your top 25 player list that would include Nurkic.   However, opinions can be wrong. If I tried to argue John Wall, my favorite player, was the best player in the league, I would 100% be wrong and everyone would agree im wrong."
"As horrible as I feel saying this, number 1 should probably be Klay. back to back ACL and Achilles injuries should do a number on his athleticism when he returns. However, everybody has said the same thing about John Wall and Kevin Durant, and they have been looking good so far so I really hope he comes back and looks good."
"Even with the jury still out on John Wall, their team still improved immensely by literally adding a near all star level player in Wood.  I think there is zero chance he actually misses it though."
Bro you are out here comparing KEVIN DURANT and JOHN WALL who literally TORE THEIR ACHILLES to LUKE KENNARD who has knee tendinitis  Flair checks out by the way 😂
John Wall
As a big fan of harden that wouldn’t look good on his resume. He has John wall which still looks great and Christian wood who is looking like an all star if he doesn’t make the playoffs I would say it’s a disappointment even with everything that happened.
"It's like John wall and corner threes, but joker kinda just does it wherever"
I've read an OC here once that said John Wall is the most average #1 pick in the history of the league.
"Fit matters though. I mean, Harden's Rockets are a great example of that with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and now John Wall (because Harden's leaving) all having fairly short stints playing alongside him.  Another great example is that Olympic team real early in LeBron's career where it seemed like he was the only one playing hard and they lost to Puerto Rico. They would have been better off only taking NBA players that wanted to be there instead of just the biggest stars they could get.  Fit matters way more than some people think."
We didn't plan for John Wall to be out for 2 straight seasons while we were capped out?
"John wall and jerami grants performances so farvare the biggest surprises for me.      Biggest disappointments are the nets and wizards starts, and ive been pretty disappointed in zion so far. Hes been good but im expecting a lot more from him."
&gt; MIP is just the “player whose PPG increased the most because of a new team/role” award  Who is MIP this year? I can probably give you a few names to make it at least a debate.  We're only 6/7 games in and I can already tell you that Kevin Durant would get the CPOTY award this year (with John Wall as an outside chance) and Klay Thompson would get it next year.  At least the Ingram vs Bam debate last year was more interesting.
"MVP - John Wall  MIP - Christian Wood  ROTY - JaeSean Tate  DPOTY - PJ Tucker  FMVP - James Harden  Final two teams - Rockets/don't care  Champion - Rockets  Can't forget COTY going to Silas, 6MOTY going to Boogie.  I'm unbiased, this is just my honest opinion."
"John Wall and KD have been amazing and look like somehow they haven’t missed a step. I hope in the future the Achilles is the new ACL tear where it’s bad but not completely career altering. My biggest disappointment has been Ben Simmons. When will he take that superstar step we all want to see, when will he have a serviceable jumper"
"**Biggest surprises:** Sabonis having a career year, Tobias Harris bouncing back from an awful 1st game to winning EC Player of the Week and looking excellent ever since, John Wall immediately returning to form, Steph immediately returning to form, Kevin Durant looking awesome after the injury, Knicks actually looking good under Thibs, PG13 off to an amazing start without Kawhi, Celtics looking better than I expected. Also the rookies seem to be doing very well despite it being called a weak draft. Got guys popping off all over the league.                **Biggest disappointments:** Siakam falling off a cliff since the bubble, Wizards with a lot of close losses (I had them as a playoff team with Russ, not that they can't turn it around), Nets with a few disappointing losses after looking dominant early on, Raptors in general look bad, Oubre's start. Nothing that can't be fixed though on this list."
John Wall playing like an all star
"UK guards drafted since 2010:  2010: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  2011: Brandon Knight, Josh Harrellson, Deandre Liggins  2012: Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb  2013: Archie Goodwin  2015: Devin Booker, Andrew Harrison  2016: Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis  2017: De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk  2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Hamidou Diallo  2019: Tyler Herro  2020: Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley"
john wall got that westbrook energy tonight
yikes john wall. that shot selection.
John Wall is fast.
If you don't like John Wall you can move back to Russia.
Has john wall been good
Anyone know what shoes John Wall and Dorian Finney Smith are wearing?  The white and black shoes with the black toes?
"20 year old John Wall was better than a 12 year old Luka.  True, fuck man you really got me with that sick trolololol. That was le epic man, me gusta or some shit. Am I speaking your language yet?"
John Wall is so much better off ball and slashing then Westbrook. Just so much more control.
"John Wall tries to push the pace, Harden jogs back and doesn't cross the halfcourt. Wall wide open in the corner for two possessions, Harden ISOs and doesn't pass to him. Harden about to chase out another all star"
they could be playing the same footage of john wall yelling every time and i would have no idea
Because I don’t care what anybody who thinks Luka is better than John Wall has to say.
"Even if I could, why would I make that bet when I don’t even think the Mavs are necessarily better than the Rockets?  Where did I say that the Mavs are better than the rockets? Weren’t we talking about John Wall vs Luka? Did you go to school when you were a kid?"
"Me believing Luka is a better player than John Wall has nothing to do with the Mavs being a better team than the Rockets or vice versa, are you dumb or are you stupid?"
"Oh 100%, as I said I ain’t getting involved with the ‘who’s better debate’ as there’s too many facets to it, like that’s the type of things I’d rather discuss light-heartedly in person over a couple drinks, plus I don’t know for certain which of these 2 I’d say is better  I was just naming Luka’s shot making ability as one thing he has over John Wall, as per how you asked to name one thing Luka did better"
I still can't believe how good John Wall is.
"Not knowing what to expect from John Wall coming into this year, I am blown away. Dude can fucking ball. On both sides."
look at that John Wall defense! all-nba defense
Let me see you do the John wall
Luka is already better than prime John wall what are you smoking
I died when I saw John wall below Caris levert and andre drummond...
No you can use a DPE on any player as long as its season ending. Depending on NBA Approval. They declined the Wizards DPE for John Wall.
When they’re playing well my 5 are probably:  Ish smith  John wall  Hayward  Siakam  Jokic
"I might be wrong, but John Wall is probably the most famous example."
John wall had serious infections resulting from his ACL surgery. Surgeries always have some risk even with the best docs
or if theres a life threatening infection? like Livingston? like John Wall? like BOOSIE?
Not tonight. John Wall will make him his son
The league is better with John wall. Elite passer and at the time was a top 4 player at his position. People really did forget what he looked like when his playing well.
"Chris Paul, John Wall, Isaiah Thomas (even tho he was a nugget for a second), DeAndre Jordan  The lob city clippers were so fun to watch (and DJ is such a wholesome dude), the Isaiah Thomas Celtics were another one of my favorite teams outside Denver, and John Wall was such a fuckin beast on the wizards and I'm excited that he's playing again"
Tobias Harris and John Wall
"John Wall, Devin Booker"
My team is 2/4 and john wall and Wood look incredible. I'm doing fantastic. How are you?
"Yea there was this entire thing where John Wall looked lazy half the time looked discontent (pre injuries) but that wasn’t without reason. There’s this entire oh you are a basketball player you should be happy to be making money doing it, but then you’re like one of the greatest basketball players of your generation playing on a team that’s managed by buffoons that aren’t doing their jobs getting the help Wall needed to contend in the East.   Wall needed to leave for his own mental/emotional health."
"You must have never watched John Wall if you don't think that he manipulates the defense using PnR. He is a certified savant, the athleticism is just extra.  [Wall's Basketball IQ](https://youtu.be/_pPGCtrEWqM)"
"Curry doing his circus 3 pointers, Kevin Durant playing like he was never injured, John Wall with the rockets, Russel Westbrick still chasing his triple doubles...  Only if we still had Klay :("
Seeing John Wall and KD play makes me so hopeful for a strong return.
"Maybe it's just become repetitive. Now that he's playing w/ Christian Wood, John Wall, and the corpse of Boogie w/ a different coach, it's become interesting again. It also seems like he kinda likes that rookie Jae'Sean Tate kid."
Watching John wall and KD play so great gives me much hope for klay
"I rememebe listening to Cowherd when hecwas on ESPN Radio, on my commute to work. He always had the most irrationally bad takes in regards to 2 athletes: John Wall and Peyton Manning."
It’s actually really refreshing to see positive things about John Wall. Wish him the best.
Damn and John Wall was killing it in washington
Naw John wall does because hes a real baller
Dude why did Washington trade John wall he looks good coming back
"Yeah and it's John fucking wick I mean wall in DC, where he belongs..."
Wholesome John Wall
That John Wall guy would look nice on the wiz right now
You guys remember the John Wall dance?
So happy for John Wall
"KD and John Wall both got 2 full years off, maybe that’s the way to go"
John Wall being a better coach for us than Luke ever has been.
"I'm sorry?  The title of the post is  &gt;[Anderson] Buddy Hield says John Wall was coaching him during the game: ""He looks really good. He's talking and being a coach out there for his teammates. He’s very positive. *He’s even telling me stuff I can do to get open.*"""
"Therefore, John Wall is Micheal Jordan"
John Wall fantasy managers be salivating
That John Wall guy is good
I don’t see a problem at all. It’s not everyday all star caliber players come out of nowhere. Also factor in that John wall is 100% back so you now have one helluva 3 headed monster surprisingly. Nothing wrong at ALL with this hype
Are you surprised John Wall plays defense? Swear most of this sub wasn't even watching ball the last time he was playing lol
Yes and I actually don’t think this should be a knock at Harden. Sometimes it’s just not in someone’s personality and makeup to be telling people what to do and leading. It’s been super interesting to watch the last few games because John Wall can literally do all of that while James just sort of keeps to himself and gets buckets on buckets. I think the Rockets are about to be way better than people initially thought.
Harden a PG now? On a team with John Wall?
Only wall lbj will hit is John Wall
John Wall is less than 2 years older than Buddy Hield wtf
John Wall specifically adds a considerable amount to each team he is on from a leadership and teammate perspective.
Rockets trade CP3 for Russ &gt; CP3 is better. Wizards trade John Wall for Russ &gt; ? If John Wall turns out better...lol
"Let me tell you something. If the Rockets end this messy divorce with: Christian Wood, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Caris Levert, Jarret Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie and 5 picks, they would have done a damn good job.  I do not think that is the deal, but even if it ends up being Kyrie and a broken Dinwidde + STILL all those picks? WORTH IT."
John Wall doesn't deserve this :(
"Sure but I don’t see any path for this team being top 5 in the west with this roster. Mavericks, suns, clippers, lakers and blazers are so much more talented. Harden relying on Boogie and John wall to finally make a finals run is simply not happening. If he bought in, this team would get bounced in the first or 2nd round of the playoffs and Harden doesn’t want that happening to him again."
Rooting for John wall. Fuck harden
"john wall, youre always welcome to golden state warriors lmao"
shhh no they’d be filthy at point guard with Kyrie and John wall they definitely want him. Please take him. Please.
&gt; Take the most chronically injured player in the league  What did John Wall do?
What if they make the nets take the John wall contract too?
"For everyone mentioning Kyrie, not only is he making himself untradeable, he's also a point guard. Doesn't Houston already have one of them in John Wall? Why would they trade a forward for, of all things, a point guard?!?"
"Kyrie Irving has perfected the tanking of trade value play-style that James Harden used to have with John Wall. It's even better that he doesn't have similar problems in the media that James Harden had.  We thought James Harden was the pinnacle for dropping trade value but Kyrie Irving is rewriting history. John Wall and the rest of the staff are probably super jealous of the coaching staff behind Brooklyn because this team is going to even greater heights."""
"I like Ingram with John wall and Christian wood, lets do it"
"If you’d like then only 60% of Giannis’ dunks are assisted. That puts him up there with lebron, John wall, Paul George, and a bunch of guards like Wall."
"The difference between how Harden is talking about the team and how John Wall is talking about them is so staggering. While obviously the Rockets aren't in that top TOP tier, there are a slew of new pieces trying to gel and I'm blown that that reality hasn't set in. Harden had MULTIPLE teams that were good enough to win a chip and hasn't come through, maybe he is the problem lol."
his comment completely missed the point of the OP's comment  &gt;Having sympathy for John wall being in a shitty situation? He's made 200m+! Who cares!  just because it's a pandemic doesn't mean you can't have sympathy for an nba player. moronic take. get off the subreddit if you just want to mope
He’s saying John wall isn’t allowed to be unhappy with his current situation because he made 200 million. That’s a stupid argument lmao I don’t care
"who cares what john wall thinks.  the man hasn't played in 2 years, with no playoff success, 0 50 win seasons and is nowhere close to approaching the hall of fame.  fat harden is 5x the player prime wall is.  the reporter should ask a bench player. its the same thing."
John wall went from being the face of the franchise in DC to having to watch harden take 30 isos a game
All I know is John Wall is the adult in the room. So much respect for the guy. And he knows how to party while still keeping it relatively low key and out of the lime light!!
If you think the Rockets are taking a straight up trade for Kyrie when they already have John Wall on a big contract then I think you’re mistaken. Harden is more valuable to hold onto than Kyrie will ever be now that he has shown he is incapable of being a reliable player on an NBA team.
"john wall doesn't look like his old self and his old self wasn't that impactful when it came to winning as evidenced by the fact he was playing with beal in the east and they never did anything.  boogie has been awful and wood is good at offense and terrible at defense.  harden could do his 35 ppg thing and drag this team to a 6th seed or something (and then hear rockets fans complain that he shouldn't be doing his 35 ppg thing), but he's pretty clearly done with that."
"I'm getting so sick of so many people just constantly mentioning money in relation to how we view players.   Kyrie being penalised? He doesn't care what people think of him with how much he makes!  Having sympathy for John wall being in a shitty situation? He's made 200m+! Who cares!  I know the demographic is young, a mod said 20-24 is average age,  but geez it gets old when the only mentality is young people thinking money will make you view life so differently that you won't have issues anymore or won't care about how you're perceived."
"Rafael could have done it as soon as Harden requested it, instead he trades for the same type of PG in John Wall,  where he already had and who James has already said he doesn’t want to play with another primary ball handler.  I don’t agree with everything Harden has done but it’s clear that they aren’t on the same page about it and maybe you just need to leave things where they are."
You think John Wall was a good teammate and leader in DC?
John Wall is one of the most unwilling passers in the game. Absolutely hated his style in Washington. Makes it so hard for his teammates to get going.
John Wall talking facts....but we are all sitting here wondering how long it will be before hes out because of injury.....
And how many games until Butler is ready to kill Harden?  John Wall has only made it about a dozen.
"That's because they get traded away once their huge contracts start coinciding with their twilight years (see John Wall, Dwyane Wade, Blake Griffin)"
"True, but how often has Harden decided, ""this isn't a good team"" and pulled stuff?  I'm sure Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall all feel like Harden gave it his full effort. /s"
"When Barkley ring chased, he left money on the table, as did a lot of great including Dirk and to lesst extent the Heatless. It pains me see those primadonnas do what they do. On the other hand, new found respect for John Wall for such a public statement"
"Westbrook may suck now but he was really good last year.   John wall only has maybe 1 year better than him in 17 wall and walls not going be 17 wall again even though he’s had some good games.  Like westbrook, not a good fit with harden.  Someone like Beverley was ideal and Paul was fine not having the ball sometimes and contributing in other ways.  Robert Covington is back to underrated again.  No he’s not the defender he was in Philly but he was their best defender last year and really the reason why small ball defended so well."
"Depends on position and skill set.  A point guard that thrives on athleticism like John Wall, Russell Westbrook, or D'Aaron Fox will decline quicker.  Then you have players like Shaun Livingston, Grant Hill, George Hill, Vince Carter, and Kobe Bryant who increases their longevity in the league by focusing on strengthening skills that can help them succeed despite declining athleticism. Fancy footwork, positioning, expanding shooting range, etc."
"As a Rockets fan I will miss him but its totally understandable.   He was brought in, and flurished, in a system made for him. His record will be one of the all time greatest and in the space of a summer its become apparent the new owner wont spend, the back office and coaching team he loved left, no contender talent brought in and the team core is totally unproven.  He gave his best years' and it couldn't work.  John Wall has been a great surprise, but chats it, a surprise. Same for Wood. These are players performing above their expectations but these expectations were low.  Rockets will not be able to successfully rebuild with Trump-lite owning them, especially during the extended economic pandemic damage the US hospitality scene is facing."
why do people always bring up salary as if its the end all be all. once you make a certain amount the money truly doesnt matter and john wall is millions of dollars past that point
This team is not that talented. Boogie gets a tech every game and is a mess. The coach doesn’t know what he’s doing and how to balance John Wall with Harden. Wood is totally lost on defense lol. Every team needs role players and I honestly can’t name one good role player on this team. Nwaba starts for this team and he’s at best a 9th man on a talented team or maybe even worse lmao
"I don’t watch the rockets and I guess I’m biased as a blazers fans and some of the AWFUL teams we’ve put around Dame, but...how is this rockets team not good enough? Upgraded roco for Christian wood, upgraded Russ for John wall. Still have house, tucker, Gordon. This should be a competitive team. Bench is a little thin but that’s what the trade deadline is for."
"lebron got to the finals on that shit team that never put pieces around him     harden got CP3 and diva'ed him off the team and is stinkfacing john wall who has been outplaying him this year     wade was dead and lebron saw the writing on the wall, what's he gonna do, carry a health failing wade? without wade even if bosh had been healthy that team wasn't going to be nearly as good     lebron got to the finals even when kyrie left, he dragged bums on two teams to the finals and won a ring for the cavs, and left when wade was going south     how are you going to equate 3 rings between two teams to someone who never got to the finals and choked in earlier rounds? i'd like you to show me when lebron quit on a team mid-season and came to work out of shape and said his team was dogshit and he wanted out"
Smush parker and Kwame brown do not compare to John wall and Cousins
"&gt; There is a lot of talent on the rockets. With a fully bought it Harden they could be contenders.  I feel like y'all are flat out delusional saying stuff like this.  In what world is a core of Harden, Christian Wood, and John Wall going to compete with a team like the Lakers?  Harden/Embiid or Harden/KD are both much better cores."
"I don't think he quit, but he's not going to fully buy into a system with the roster he has. He's still playing and trying. Stephen Silas has done some weird shit and is basically forcing the ball into the hands of guys that just aren't as good as Harden. Harden hasn't been defiant to what Silas wants to do.  &amp;#x200B;  His shots are down because of the emphasis Silas wants to have on sharing the ball and ball movement. He wants to do what the Warriors did to MDA's Rockets but with a fraction of the talent.  &amp;#x200B;  And he's absolutely right. The team isn't good enough to compete with any of the 4 top teams. Their defensive scheme is non existent and the effort of the whole team isn't there. Sure, you can say it's because Harden isn't trying. But Harden doesn't WANT to be their leader. He wants out and was fully transparent in that.  &amp;#x200B;  I really like John Wall and Wood and Cousins and everyone else. Danuel House can fuck off, but I like the rest. But if they were all looking to Harden to still be their leader, that's kinda their own fault.  &amp;#x200B;  People have been begging for arguably the greatest ISO player we've seen in decades to facilitate more, shoot less, etc. This is what that looks like when you don't have a stacked team to accommodate it."
He quit. John Wall their 3rd option is averaging 18/5/5
I feel like this is the first time I ever heard John Wall speak
Wasn't John Wall the one who was feuding with teammates in Washington?
Does any team want john wall
John Wall 🤝 Joe Biden  “Come on man!”
"Roster isn't even that good. Eric Gordon, pj tucker, and boogie are washed. John wall is inconsistent so CWood is the only other consistent player on that team"
I hope the Rockets get a really good deal for Harden and they can play some competitive basketball while John Wall gets his career back on track. The man is doing his best and having a good season for what he's been through
"“Don’t worry, once that guy who at his worst is averaging 20PPG is outta here, we’ll be a contender for sure.”  - John Wall I guess?"
"[https://www.google.com/search?q=john+wall+demands+trade&amp;oq=john+wall+demands+trade&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5536j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=john+wall+demands+trade&amp;oq=john+wall+demands+trade&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5536j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)  Why are we using Wall as a posterboy for good leadership when he just wanted out of Washington too? This Harden-is-toxic-because-he-wants-a-trade-from-a-shitty-run-franchise narrative is overdone and acts if this is some sort of unique thing...  Not to be combative; genuinely curious, as I remember Wall had some drama with the Wizards too"
"As a Jazz fan, I take pleasure in watching the Rockets fall apart, but I can't help but feel bad for John Wall who's trying to get his career back on track."
I’ve watched every minute of Rockets basketball  I’ll tell you now that John Wall is not the issue at all.  Don’t know how someone who claims to watch Rockets games would come to this conclusion.
Harden didn’t want wall lmao he wanted OUT. You really think they got better playoff chances with a John wall that hasn’t been playing for 2 years. The fact is they’re literally rebuilding and trying to get good pieces out of trading Harden while he wants out of Houston no matter what. No one in the right mind thinks Houston is a better team with Wall over Westbrook cause they are literally the same damn trash player.
"In terms of being a detriment to the team, John Wall is arguably the worst player in the NBA currently. A complete black hole who looks for his numbers almost every single time down. The physical ability is very close to his levels in Washington - but he’s regressed so hard mentally it’s actually shocking. He is incapable of making good decisions and is actively playing keep away from one of the best scorers of all time. Harden has been and will continue to be out of line - but for Houston fans to not be pointing towards Wall as the primary culprit for the early season poor play is ridiculous. Harden has never had a worse fit in his entire basketball career. Everyone undeniably needs a change here."

"I agree, everyone was unlucky that the GOAT team was assembled, and then afterwards LeBron went to the West.   Regardless, he had good teams. His team pushed the GOAT team to 7 games in the WCF. He hasn’t played well in all of his post season runs so there is blame to go around.   HOU went all in to help this dude, but they’ve run out of gas now. They’ve tried to get John Wall but it seems not enough. That’s ok. That’s what happens in the league. Harden now wants to slander the team, ruin the locker room, and throw a tantrum to get traded. That’s not a leader. Worse teams have made bigger runs. Harden has given up and he’s blaming the team. BUM."
"Obviously I'm talking about John Wall who I expect to be back at All-Star level this season. And the reason they had no preseason and missed games was *because* of James Harden. Everyone else was there and playing basketball when they could, you can't say that the failings of James Harden are a reason why James Harden should want to skip town and other teams should give up assets for him. Harden in Philly is the same situation except Joel is probably even more moody than Wall."
Poor John Wall man
"I agree. But I’m really not sure why Harden won’t try one last time. This team is very talented. John Wall is looking like his old self, Boogie can still be solid, and Wood is looking like an MIP favorite. This can be the 2nd best Rockets team Harden has had if he really buys in."
"Who is a perennial all-star besides him? Can’t be talking about John Wall. He hasn’t played in 2 years.   Christian Wood is playing well for the first time *literally ever*.   That team had no preseason, missed games from COVID, and hasn’t gelled together once all season.   James Harden is *probably the key to the problem* but he’s also right; the Rockets aren’t a good basketball team right now."
"Ehh Dame could absolutely win as a 2nd option, which is what John Wall is being asked to do."
"That's fine and all, but John Wall is talking about buying in yet he seemingly isn't buying in fully either. That's all I'm saying."
To be fair that’s how John Wall has always been when the ball isn’t in his hands lol
I mean he's not tho.  No way you guys think guys like russ/Dame will never win but John Wall can.  Harden should have stuck with cp3 and maybe Russ. This tho? Ain't it.
"What John Wall really wanted to say,: "" Yall know he doesnt want to play here, so fuck off and ask him what the issue is, I'm just tryna have my comeback year"""
They suck man. He's been facilitating and they just all still stink. John Wall has one good game out of every three and people blow him. Boogie has like one good play out of every six tries. PJ Tucker is putting up DNP style 0s across the board.   The team is absolute trash. I don't even think Harden of two years ago could carry them.
John Wall my new best friend
John Wall suddenly busting out of a fucking building after James Harden's declaration of war
"I wonder if ATL could string together something. Christian Wood, John Wall, John Collins, and Reddish? That's a pretty formidable squad for Houston.  And what East backcourt can stop Trae and Harden? All evidence suggests Capela and Harden have good chemistry on and off the court..."
John Wall looks just as disinterested as Harden when the ball isn't in his hands either.
I do feel for John Wall like guy finally playing again and this
"John Wall was like f*** it, if you aint gonna trade him Im about to lit this joint on fire"
"Off-court issues.  Basketball is a team game. It's like a machine that has several parts on it. If there are fit issues, no matter how good that part is, it won't work.  Harden is ranting already and it affects team morale. Trading him for a good haul will make the difference. I can feel that John Wall is much more fit to be the leader of the team."
"""How come he don't love me man"" - John Wall probably"
"    Takeaways   Positives :   \- Easily the best defensive game we’ve played this year. Rotations and closeouts were on time today, and our rim protection was great too.   \-  I loved KCP’s man defense tonight. Dude built a wall in front of John Wall, rendering his slashing ineffective.  \- AD’s rim protection is back (5 blocks) ! AD must focus more defensively like he has today if we want to get a high seed. He shot at an unreal clip, going 88/100/100. Lets pray he keeps this up for the rest of his career.  \- I hope that more of you can see how valuable Gasol can be. His passing opens up so many avenues offensively, and it can cause defenses to stumble.   \- Although THT had a rough game scoring-wise, he still can affect the game with his playmaking and pesky defense. Expect him to get more minutes during the playoffs, when Gasol is forced to sit (due to certain matchups that will exploit his slow feet relentlessly).  \- It’s obvious how much Lebron is coasting. Dude’s pulling up from 3 casually, which honestly is kinda strange considering his good shot selection. Not saying that he’s taking bad shots, I just wanted to give an example of how much he’s coasting. But it’s insane how he can still play at such a high level considering how he’s coasting at the age of 36!   Negatives :   \- Do the Lakers practice with a 10 second shot clock? If they do, explains why they’re rushing things so much. We’re rushing our transition attacks, which leads to careless turnovers. In the half court, players are missing open passing angles because they’re rushing the passes. I’m not sure man, hopefully the Lakers slow down once they stop playing with Rockets.  \- We should help Nate Robinson come out of his retirement and give him a contract. He should be able to teach our guys how to dunk properly.  Please tell me if I missed anything."
John Wall or KCP for Shaqtin MVP?
"if you were watching the game (i dont blame you for not, this game is horrific) he had a sick one hander after the whistle earlier that looked like old john wall.  he just got too lax here.  he still has great athleticism"
"Goddamn this made me sad, would’ve been a nasty dunk a few years ago 😔  [I mean look at this](https://photostore.nba.com/featured/3-john-wall-garrett-ellwood.html)"
T'f was that John Wall lol
I ❤️ John Wall
John Wall and Kyrie is a hilarious backcourt. That had a quasi-rivalry at some point as well.
Do you think Houston could keep Harden if they trade John Wall for Kyrie? Is that even possible at this point?
I choose John Wall because that's my point guard for life
"I don't know trade rules very well, but is it possible that Houston trade *Wall* for Kyrie at this point? I got the feeling Harden wanted out of Houston after they picked up John Wall. The Nets would surely want JW over the basket case that is Kyrie Irving at this point, and Harden and Kyrie seem to have a lot in common."
"For those saying a Harden for Kyrie trade would be a bad idea for Houston, you might be right.  However, if Kyrie tries and pulls this shit playing next to John Wall and Boogie he's going to get a pretty swift reality check to the jaw; it might be good for him in the long run."
Achilles who? Same with John Wall.  Sports medicine has come a LOOOOONG way.  Happy both are killing it.
"You repeated what I said about John Wall.  I brought up other players for comparison, since when a player suffers a major injury they’re compared based on the the severity of the injury. A Steph Curry finger is the worst analogy you could of said. You missed everything I said. You shouldn’t have responded. Thanks for your time."
John Wall gave 100% more effort in Washington then Kyrie did in either Cavaliers or Celtics.
"Curry, Dame, CP3, Luka...if you count Harden as a point guard then there is no way Kyrie makes the top 5. Even if not, then it’s between Kyrie and Westbrook. At least you know Westbrook is always gonna give you 100%. And if John Wall can come back anywhere close to his old self then that’s another contender."
"It doesn't matter how much time people missed from an injury if it's a whole different injury to a whole different part of the body; it cannot be compared. Curry breaking a finger bone and missing a season is NOT (I repeat, NOT) the same magnitude of an injury as KD having his Achilles tendon snapped in two. If you cannot understand this simple thing, please do not bother responding.  &gt; John Wall missed a lot of time. Is he not playing good? Multiple injuries?  Were you in a Thai prison the last three years? He played just 73 games in 3 seasons. That's a lot of games missed from a lot of injuries.  &gt; Oladipo had a bad year, now returning to form. You bring up old stats. Talk about this season.  I am talking about KD's first year back so I was talking about Oladipo's first year back. Not to mention that Oladipo hasn't been looking like himself from before the injury anyhow. Are you just gonna call them ""down years"" until they retire?  &gt; Kawhi also missed a ton of time, came back won a chip.  Kawhi's injury is nothing like hurting Achilles tendon, so this cannot be compared to KD's return. Why did you even bring Kawhi up all of a sudden lol. Besides, Kawhi has never been himself (it would be very obvious to you if you watched his games before and after the injuries) after the injury.  &gt; Most of y’all type of fans just cant appreciate shit lol. Always looking for negative.  It's called being realistic. I'd consider assuming every injury (especially injuries like this that has had a real bad history) goes well is delusional. It is NOT idiotic to assume that KD won't be himself coming back from an injury that literally just one player (Dominique Wilkins, if I remember correctly) came right back into.   What's funny is that we're not even saying ""OH BUT KD WILL GET HURT AGAIN"", we're literally just appreciating KD coming back great from a devastating injury. I think you're the one who's always looking to bash people."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
He would be John Wall without Lebron. Still an all star
"Examples from serious injuries requiring significant time missing. The players I named eventually are returning to form. Achilles injury comparisons To KD are all from older players.   John Wall missed a lot of time. Is he not playing good? Multiple injuries?   Oladipo had a bad year, now returning to form. You bring up old stats. Talk about this season.   Kawhi also missed a ton of time, came back won a chip.   Most of y’all type of fans just cant appreciate shit lol. Always looking for negative."
"bruh, bones breaking and snapping Achilles can't really be compared. One is bone and other is a tendon, and it's known on the internet that bones heal better than ligaments/tendons.  You also said see John Wall/Cousins/Oladipo, but they really aren't that good examples.  Cousins have been complete shite since he returned and got hurt over and over.  Wall couldn't stay healthy since he got hurt 4 years ago (played less than 50% of the games every season since so far)  Oladipo? well.. See last season stats lol.   I honestly don't know how you thought to bring them up as ""good"" examples."
"Only idiots thought his return from injury would be bad. Those that doubt him watch numbers. Or think because mediocre players didn’t recover well from injury that KD wouldn’t.   Nobody talks how PG broke his whole leg in a game, playing great now. Or Caris Levert broke his foot and returned same season. KD is a whole different beast.   Better doctors are out there. Players can recover from multiple injuries and play great. See John Wall, D Cousins, V Oladipo."
Only way i'm trading for Kyrie is if the Nets want John Wall. aint no way i'm giving up Harden for this mf
"Kentucky fan here. Fox is one of my favorite players of the Cal era. Up there with John Wall, Boogie, and AD. Besides being a freak athlete, he’s just a really intelligent, interesting dude. Dude would cram on your face and then beat you in Yu-Gi-Oh cards."
"My question is why care about the Olympic deadline. The usa could field a team with players who didn't make the playoffs and do it at the same time. (although I suppose it could have an affect on ratings). Like you telling me a team lead by Beal, Grant and Lavine wouldn't instantly be the best national team anyway unless Giannis and Simmons are playing for theirs. And you still have John Wall, Christian Wood, Hield, Fox, Kat, DLo etc."
"I think he has the skill level of some of the guards that have made the all-star game in the past, but the problem is that we are in such a guard-heavy NBA that many great high-level guards won't make the all-star game.  Just look at the point guard position in the west you have Dame, Steph, Chris Paul, Jamal Murray, and John Wall."
"Fine?  He's averaging over 5 turnovers a game, shooting below 40% from the field, 30% from deep and jacking up almost 20 shots a night for the Wizards.   Rockets are fucking laughing right now because John Wall is playing like an All-Star while they got out of Westbrook's contract, AND got a draft pick too"
Beal being 6’3 he’s actually an inch shorter than John wall and the same height as Steph

I personally don't have any praise for Tillman Fertitta but if you're going to criticize him at least have the correct information. He's been wanting to purchase the rockets for roughly 2 decades. He lost the bid in 1993 to the previous owner. While financially he may not have been equipped to pay for everything but he chased his dream.   He paid good money to keep those Rockets team in contention for a moment. His biggest mistake was not talking to his star players enough making them disgruntled and feel like they weren't part of the process.  He's forced to keep John Wall because nobody is trading for that Contract. If you get Simmons you get ball dominant players and neither can shoot. While John Wall is an improved shooter you don't want him to be spotting up often.
My comment is damn near self explanatory but here. John Wall has been injured on and off for years. Even when he has played he is just a high volume shooter who doesnt impact games positively anymore.  I dont know why I see as many posts about him as I do. He isnt a star anymore. He hardly ever was. He's had like 3 star seasons and thats it. Barely broke 20ppg during his prime.
"Yesterday on a Rockets Instagram fan page there was a poll if John Wall would leave in the offseason (meaning bought out). John Wall voted ""leaving"" in the poll."
"His college play definitely helps, though he wasn't a mind blowing college player like say John Wall (Walls college play will definitely get him in in a weaker class for example) I still don't think it puts him over the hump, but it definitely helps for sure"
Might be shorter if John Wall gets himself fully healthy and contributes (and they get some reasonable assets for him).
"Did I say John Wall was the Andre Drummond of PGs or did I say is? You need to have braincells before you can lose them. Currently John Wall isn't a good and impactful player and I don't particularly care that he once was as I was talking about now. Tense matters, go to grade 1 then come back to me."
"Yes, he could start for Nuggets, and Knicks come to mind. I would add Clips but going with Beverly and Rondo seems to be working for them so I would say debatable.    John Wall is going to be an interesting watch to these next two years.  He is already taking petty shots at Houston about leaving.  But with every team healthy who would, he start for?  Would he be willing to accept a 6th man role?   Maybe I am being overly down on him but I just don't see him as a player that would move the needle for a team and especially for the type of money he would want."
Start John Wall over Kemba Walker without question? I think there’s at least a debate to be had there. Kemba was an all star last year and even on a load management year after injury/surgery he’s still putting up 19 PPG and 5 AST on better shooting splits than Wall (Wall averaged 20/7 on higher usage). They seem like pretty comparable players to me from the numbers. Haven’t watched a lot of Rockets games to see how his defense has been this year.
yea and i dont think john wall is the guy
You’re surprised? John Wall isn’t exactly a high character guy.
Yeah this is the thing.  No real Rockets fans should have any serious problem with John Wall suggesting he doesn't want to play in HOU lol.  It's a mutual feeling but he's kinda stuck here for now so what are you going to do?  You gotta hope he doesn't get *too* disgruntled but at this point I'm happy with the attitude he's had.
Crazy to think how recently john wall was ranked the 13th best player in the league. Still miss him in dc :(
Sure they did. I’m gonna need to see proof of life from these Rockets players. Have John Wall hold up a newspaper with today’s date.
"&gt; IDK it's hard to match the high threshold of ""John Wall liked a post on instagram""   I mean, what's your point?  There are other unrelated posts that should be cut, too? I don't think anyone would disagree and want all unrelated posts removed, not just WNBA ones."
"People literally thought John Wall, who has never been close to as good as Westbrook, would come back after 2 years and a torn Achilles and now be better than Westbrook. People here are kind of confused about basketball sometimes."
there is ZERO CHANCE the reason the Rockets were so bad was John Wall.  That roster is one of the WORST EVER
John Wall is the Andre Drummond of Point Guards
Is John wall liking an Instagram post the NBA?
At least Boogies having a good time on the Clippers now with his buddy Rondo. John Wall now the odd man out.
for real. if russ puts up a 25 point triple double on that shooting he gets called a net negative. now imagine him putting up 14/0/0/0/0. john wall putting up 2k myplayer statlines rn 😭😭😭
"John Wall redemption story, confirmed"
How is John Wall still relevant? He doesnt deserve the amount of attention he gets.
"Famous Boogie quote: the disrespect by Harden regarding his teammates, but honestly, I'm just here to play with John Wall. Lmao."
They would be pretty interesting with wood+KPj running the show instead of John wall trying to relive his glory days
John wall for kemba trade who says no
"“Any other PG would’ve made the most of what they have” is the equivalent of saying “John wall is playing the worst PG play of all time, anyone else would’ve done better” indisputably wrong lol.   Your team is dog shit, everyone is playing like it. John Wall is basically getting the most out of the Rockets, and this is the most. Trying to act like one guy is the reason you suck is stupid in a team sport. They all look bad. He can’t stop every player on your team from being a turnstile. And if I were John I wouldn’t wanna waste my time there either personally"
Don't use KD and John Wall as the time it takes to recover from an achilles. The timing of their tears made it so that they had to wait for the season to start. Generally its 9-12 months when you can start playing again. Obviously it'll depend on the person and you won't be at a 100%. You'll have to see how to do limited minutes and increase them.
"What’s funny is that one click from John wall on via his Instagram on some random poll will now end up on the Gms desk, guaranteed. Not that anyone on the rockets is probably surprised, but it’s wild how these things really matter now"
"IDK it's hard to match the high threshold of ""John Wall liked a post on instagram"""
What I meant by KD timeline is the fact that Klay might be coming back sooner than KD and John Wall did from their achilles tears so the team might want to give Klay some extra time to recover
But this sub said Houston with John wall harden and cousins had a chance to go to contend  🤣
Pacers almost had 4y / $ 112m on the books for a player who may approach John Wall levels of injury concerns.  Really dodged a bullet there.
"John Wall and Zach Lavine are closers but Middleton, who was 2 game winners this playoffs, isn’t?"
How are you including John Wall and not Embiid
"What about for John Wall and a few picks? Possibly another player but Wall makes more than Simmons. Wall gets another shot on a contender, Simmons gets to a new start with lower expectations and the ability to expand his game and possibly redemption after a rebuild."
"If John Wall and Andrew Wiggins could get traded, so can Ben"
D'Angelo Russell and John Wall
John Wall for Simmons who says no
*John Wall has entered the chat*
&gt; John Wall -&gt; Clippers via buyout  I can't see Fertitta letting $92 mil worth of salary go play on another team.
Trade him to the rockets for John Wall
Place your bets now folks. Here’s mine.  Dame -&gt; Knicks (but I want the Mavericks to get him)  CJ -&gt; Celtics  Simmons -&gt; Spurs  Lowry -&gt; Sixers  Lonzo -&gt; Bulls  Kevin Love -&gt; Literally anywhere else please  John Wall -&gt; Clippers via buyout  Myles Turner -&gt; Wizards  Derozan -&gt; Sixers
John wall and 2 frp for Ben Simmons?
Rockets are still interested in a trade. May I interest you with a Simmons for John Wall?
Trade him to Houston for John Wall lol
John Wall plays for the Rockets of Houston.
a Ben simmons and John Wall backcourt...Wall would easily put up a nasty 25 PPG on 30 attempts per game
simmons for a lightly used john wall perhaps?
"I dont think they fire Doc. It's just much easier to blame it on the Ben and Embiid dynamic.  Doc is definitely stubborn and not that great at adjustments. But if you have a healthy Joel dominating and a solid point guard creating and shooting, you probably could have won this series in 6.  If I'm Philly, I'm trying to get Ben out. Gotta also think about Joel's injury history. His championship window is probably not as wide open as others.   They need to do something quick. I've been liking the Kemba for Ben ideas. Not sure I like CJ for Ben. Shit I'd probably even try John Wall for Ben at this point."
"I think there's about 10 or so teams that would be interested, I may be considering Simmons' value a little high here but he's still a top 5 defender, phenomenal playmaker so it is what it is/ I could see the Sixers being interested in the following:  Simmons for Hayward  Simmons, Shake and Isaiah Joe for Kevin Love and Darius Garland  Simmons, George Hill for Westbrook  Simmons for Porzingis  Simmons, George Hill for John Wall   Simmons for Dlo  Simmons for Ingram  Simmons for Kemba (but you know OKC will want a pick lol)  Simmons for CJ  Simmons for either Buddy Hield or Fox (unsure who they'd want more, so unsure how to make cap work  Simmons for (somebody on the Spurs - Derozen maybe? If ANYONE can figure out how to ""fix"" Simmons, it's Pop)"
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
Is John Wall for Simmons something Sixers would think about.  Being half serious
John Wall
Simmons for John Wall.
Maybe Simmons for John Wall and Eric Gordon. Houston not looking to do anything real in the next 2-3 years anyway. Philly could lob a couple of picks their way to sweeten the deal.
Leave us alone our best player rn is injured ass john wall.
"Not just outside of John Wall. Outside of Tate, PJ, Nwaba, KJ Martin  The only people he would fit well with is Wood and perhaps Eric Gordon."
"Nah man, they will find a partner. He sucked ass in the playoffs and needs to go but he isn’t John Wall he still has value to a lot of teams."
john wall for ben simmons
John Wall and a 1st
Ironically Simmons would have fit well on the rockets outside of John wall. Him and Christian wood are a great match. I think the Timberwolves with Kat is a gold pairing and the wolves need a leader defensively.
"Idk I think Washington is a pretty small market, I can’t think of the last high quality free agent they landed. Even during the John wall days they couldn’t get anybody. I think they could be pretty good next year with this core intact. New coaching plus health plus chemistry should work wonders for them. Not serious contenders, but firmly in the playoff mix"
I’d trade him for John Wall try salvage something got more faith in him than Simmons
John Wall making 47m in the last year of his contract
I would give him away for free.  &amp;#x200B;  Or maybe the Rockets would take him for John Wall.
Rockets could offer John Wall
Ben Simmons for john wall. Only thing I see possible.
You want John Wall?
"John wall was a busted injured PG who relied on athleticism to score.  Simmons is young and his contract is a fair bit cheaper, and more than one GM will see it as a chance to pick up assets and potentially redeem Simmons value.  People weren’t even sure if Wall was gonna be able to play when he got injured.     I don’t think Simmons contract is worse than the Wall one was."
"Wow... and Daryl Morey is not on talking terms with the Rockets so he can't trade him for John Wall.  And, it pains me to say it, but I don't think the Wizards would trade Russell Westbrook for him.  So, probably the most untradable contract in the NBA..."
John Wall for Ben Simmons?
Was John Wall actually better?
Even Evan Turner was considered a pretty strong lock at #2 after John Wall
"Bro, Simmons seems cooked but please don’t act like a GM wouldn’t trade for him 100x before John Wall. Come on now."
Ben Simmons is untradeable. Worse than injured John Wall back in the day. 30+ million a year. 177 total. Does nothing well. Has 3 shots attempts in the 4th quarter for a 7 game playoff series. Worthless.
John Wall hit the most clean dougie ever  Sixers would have to throw in Maxey and Thybulle and two firsts
John wall was a max player at one point and lost it due to recurring injury. Ben Simmons was never worth it
John Wall has him well covered.
Ben Simmons for John Wall hahahahahahaha
"Fuck it , simmons for john wall"
An expensive PG tank commander?  We already have John Wall for that lol. We don’t need two
Simmons for John Wall and a pick
We forgetting about John Wall now?
John Wall would have dunked that tho lmao.
Would you Sixers fan trade Simmons for John Wall and a pick?
John Wall for Ben let's go
Easily John wall.
Simmons for John Wall. Who says no?
Is it me or would John Wall raise the ceiling of this Sixers team? Ben has to be one of the worst max contract players right now
"Lolllll yes, you’re right I’m depressed that I have a 22 year old All-World superstar who is about to sign a four year extension.  Tell me more about how J’Sean Tate and John Wall are leading your turnaround 🤣😂"
"That’s the thing about Westbrook though. Yeah, Westbrook was developed as a 1 guard due to his slightly shorter stature, maybe, but you look at the man, dude’s a unit. Russell Westbrook is a fucking tank at 6’3” 200Lbs.   Westbrook isn’t built like a Derrick Rose or a Ja Morant, not even a John Wall. Westbrook is more so built like a wing that’s missing a few inches."
&gt;James Wiseman  &gt;Steven Adams  &gt;John Wall  The slander has gotten way outta hand lmao.  &gt;LeMarcus Alderidge  Dude aint even in the league anymore bruh.
Yeah he definitely asked for John Wall and Christian wood. He also asked the owner not to pay luxury tax during their championship window.
Trade for john wall
And John Wall
They should try to get John Wall
"Don't think Celtics want John Wall way more? Please? Somehow?  Solid trade idea though, especially for this sub."
"What’s even crazier is, had he not played so well we’d be asking this same question of John Wall. That injury is devastating, pre-KD I’d say 2021 wall was a best case scenario."
LOL john wall is lying down eating chips making the same amount
"I'd trade Giannis, Jrue and any remaining picks for John Wall and Eric Gordon."
Tucker and John Wall both have permanent crybaby face etched in from crying to the refs all the time.
Welcome to Utah John Wall!
"“It’s been real, it’s been fun, but it ain’t been real fun.” -John Wall"
"I don't think anyone would trade for either of them this offseason.  But in a years time a team who wants to clear cap might even give up a pick to take John Wall. $40m coming off the books is huge, one of the other 29 teams would make it happen to revamp the side in the offseason."
Who is trading for John Wall? I doubt Houston will trade with OKC for him
John Wall
On a torn ACL? He’ll make one-legged Harden look like high school mixtape John Wall.
KLove and John Wall are worse contracts IMO
It’s bad but it’s not John wall bad
1. Klay 2. Kevin Love 3. John Wall 4. Kemba Walker 5. Tingus Pingus 6. Gobert
"Masked LeBron, untucked jersey Kyrie, gang sign John wall are nothing compared to Glasses Reggie Jackson"
"John Wall, obviously."
"Even if they are all late round picks the alternative was being stuck with Simmons contract next to John Wall. Denver didn’t offer MPJ or Murray, Miami didn’t offer Bam, and Boston didn’t offer Jaylen l. This was the best package."
They're stuck with John Wall through 2023.  I don't think they were going to take back another person making the max.  They're probably just going to try to acquire young players who are on bargain contracts for as long as Wall and Gordon are on the books.
"Russ, John wall, etc. Overpaid “stars” who can’t shoot will never win"
Houston if they don’t get their pick this season   KPJ and Wood are nice but the John Wall contract fucks putting better players around them
"And yet - every time there's been a max salary, there have been a bunch of players who get it who are clearly not worth it. It becomes a weird point of pride with guys threatening to leave for less money if the team doesn't give them every available penny.   It's not just perpetually injured guys John Wall - guys like Westbrook became negative assets the second they signed their contracts. And how much more money would Porzingis be making if the max was higher?   Maybe not having a max is the right choice, because then teams don't feel the pressure of having to say someone's a max guy to sooth his ego - but that's a real issue driving team decisions."
Trust me bro. You do not want John Wall
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.    Past 10 drafts  2010 Best Players  * John Wall (1)  * DeMarcus Cousins (5)  * Gordan Hayward (9)  * Paul George (10)   2011 Best Players  * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * Jimmy Butler (30)  2012 Best players  * Anthony Davis (1)  * Bradley Beal (3)  * Damien Lillard (6)  * Draymond Green (35)  * Khris Middleton (39)  2013 Best players  * Victor Oladipo (2)  * Giannis Anteokoumpo (15)  * Rudy Gobert (27)  2014 Best Players  * Joel Embiid (3)  * Julius Rangle (7)  * Zach Lavine (13)  * Nikola Jocic (41)  2015 Best Players  * Karl Anthony Towns (1)  * D'Angelo Russell (2)  * Devin Booker (13)  2016 Best players  * Ben Simmons (1)  * Brandon Ingram (2)  * Jaylen Brown (3)  * Domantas Sabonis (11)  * Pascal Siakam (27)  2017 Best players  * Jayson Tatum (3)  * De'Aron Fox (5)  * Donovan Mitchell (13)  * Bam Adebayo (14)  * John Collins (19)  2018 Best players  * Deandre Ayton (1)  * Luca Doncic (3)  * Trae Young (5)  * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)  2019 Best Players  * Zion Williamson (1)  * Ja Morant (2)  2020 Best Players  * La Melo Ball (3)
"Honestly, I think they knew they were blowing it up.  I got excited when the signed DeMarcus cuz I thought Russ would help him. They were technically on the team at the same time.  But later in the season after all the Harden BS, Cousins mentioned he came to Houston because he wanted to play with John Wall. So he knew they were moving Russ, and Russ knew he was moving.   And don't forget, they picked a rookie coach.  Again, imo, they were just holding out on Harden to see where they could get the best package. If James liked John and wanted to stay, then great. But they knew both of those guys were gone.  It was the worst kept secret on nba Twitter. All the insider Cali dudes said no way Harden was staying with the Rockets lol."
"Even then, they still traded him for John Wall, who recently had been on the news for showing gang signs in a photo. Idk if not being professional is something that Westbrook struggles with"
Westbrook asked out   So they got John Wall and a FRP  Wasn’t a bad move at the time
I'm sure we're gonna be shopping John Wall but that's basically the same fit as Kemba
"yes, you'd actually rather have John Wall than Kemba that's how bad he has been"
"Bucks can beat the hawks if the 76ers lose that series.  The Bucks would be heavy favourites against Hawks. However, Atlanta has got defenders like Capela and John collins that can build a wall and stop Giannis from scoring at the rim. It can be a tough series for the buck as I think the atlanta hawks are underrated.  Trae Young is a star player."
John Wall sitting alone at the allergy table
"there will be so many bad contracts offered by GMs for free  like Porzingis, John Wall, Kemba, Al Horford, Wiggins. Basically it will be an opportunity for GMs to offload some of their mistakes to a new team looking for a fresh start."
Nephews in here too young to realize the same fucking shit happened when Blake Griffin beat John Wall for RotY in 2011.
John wall HS mixtape
"The John Wozniak quarters against the wall from the last dance, and subsequently the SNL parody."
tbh I miss the draft.   2k11 playing 3 games against John Wall and Evan Turner was my favorite
Why not trade Zion for John Wall and try to win now.
He's still 100x better than Cam lol  Cam last year was the equivalent of current John Wall
I thought that Markell’s Fultz was a can’t miss prospect at point guard in the same vein of Kyrie Irving/pre-injury John Wall. Oof.
"He's not Russ, prime DRose or prime John Wall but he is insanely fast. The only man his size faster than him is Giannis."
"You're still massively ignoring the 1st-Team point and using some unsavory tactics while doing so. Stockton, despite being seen as the best point guard of his era, only made 2 1st-teams after Mark Price got injured to fuck, MJ retired the first time, and Magic Johnson had been out of the league for 3 years by the time John made his first 1st-Team. It took all of those things for Stockton to make his only 1st-Teams.  Meanwhile, Nash had Kidd, Kobe, Iverson, McGrady, CP3, Wade, Deron Williams, Tony Parker, and Chauncey Billups taking votes away from him. During Nash's best years, only McGrady missed significant time with injuries among the guys named.  During CP3's career, he's had majority-healthy seasons from Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Wade, Nash, TP, D-Will, Kobe, and on/off years from Kyrie, John Wall, and Luka Doncic to contend with.  Both Nash/Kidd and Paul had tougher, healthier competition than Stockton. If we're to believe that Stockton is this top-50 great, his only real contender post-91 was MJ for a guard spot, but another guard was always seen as better.  On voting for the top 50: ""These 50 players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers."" Players were only a portion of the voting, so your point there doesn't hold up. And players didn't pick the Dream Team; the USA Basketball committee selected them. ""It's almost as if..."" your points don't hold up."
He had one good season but then did a Ben Simmons in the playoffs. Hawks almost lost to a Wizards team with an injured John Wall. Denis Schroeder saved the hawks and that was pretty much it for Teague.
Let’s say at the least 25 wins because of John Wall though.   I’m assuming Wall helps sengun a ton in this hypothetical.
Didn't John Wall tear his while showering at home?
I hate Simmons and I think this is hilarious.  John Wall is the worst contract in the NBA. He has zero upside.  Simmons at least has upside.
"John Wall was forced into a tanking team fym? Y’all must have forgot. It wasn’t even just a bad game it was a bad series. The kid can’t shoot, he refuses to take shots. He cost his team their only shot at a title because Brooklyn and MIL will steamroll through them."
66 million is over half the fucking salary cap nobody wants Eric Gordon and John Wall for that dude
because john wall and gordon backcourt is greater than ben simmons
Kevin Love.  John Wall.
I mean he could come back and look like himself at some point - unlike say John Wall who I dont think will ever restore his value
John Wall is busted and has the worst contract in the league. That is no way to keep Embiid happy.
I’d rather go through the whole season with Maxey being our starting PG than John Wall if I’m being honest
John Wall is a lose now player
Cuz John wall is absolute bupkis and his contract is a disgrace
John Wall so good he led the Rockets to the 2nd pick
"Morey trading for John Wall would be the ultimate white flag. I don't think he'd do it, the optics and hit on his reputation would be too negative."
"This is 2021 john wall, not 2014 john wall"
i hate when teams like my wiz get forced into paying lebron-kd-curry max money for john wall or beal but signing love and griffin to those deals was just flat foolish gm decisions.
It is a negative contract but it’s definitely not untradable. Especially when you’re on a list with John Wall and Kevin Love. It can easily be dumped or used as salary filler. Even potential traded with  picks for a good player like Myles Turner or something.
"Due to age/injury issues neither the Lakers, nor the Nets make the NBA Finals.  Giannis and the Bucks repeat.  Their toughest competition will be Miami.  John Wall plays in over 60 games this season."
They said John Wall tops the list for the second year in a row but was literally traded last year lol
"The problem is that, as we have seen with LeBron a few times and KD in 2016, it is absolutely devastating to a team when star player leaves. The Cavs got multiple first overall picks the first time around, and they've been a shitshow of an org with high lotto picks and bad contracts the second time he left. KD leaving allowed Westbrook to win MVP, but he still only mustered the 6 seed for a team that was a dominant force and was up 3-1 on the GOAT Warriors while KD was there (I get that some of that may be controversial, but I'm just trying to make a point).   My point is that unless a team knows that a player will resign (in the form of an extension, usually) it makes more sense to trade them for assets than sit and let them leave. Therefore, I honestly don't think that under the current CBA, a 'star player' will finish a contract on his own team. He will simply keep getting extended until he is in the Kevin Love/John Wall category of washed, or if the player is still a star, he will be traded for assets in order to avoid losing him for nothing.  The only exception I can see to this is if a team thinks they have such a good chance at the championship, that they do not care. The example I am thinking of here is Kawhi and Toronto."
I guess we can do john wall for simmons and 1 or 2 first for him.
John Wall will live forever and ever Amen.
Eh. I mean Jalen Green can win ROY and still be an average NBA starter. John Wall can be 31 and still be a below average NBA starter.
"All related to player development for our rookies and young guys, but:  Lack of shooting and elite spacing for KPJ and Green to operate  John Wall taking minutes from KPJ, therefore stunting his development  Veterans like John Wall, EG and Danuel House take too many minutes from our rookies  And, not entirely a negative, but Our team is too good to tank for a top pick, and we're instead a play-in team: Wood is an all star, Wall stays healthy and takes more of an off-ball role, KPJ takes another step, Green and Sengun are as good as advertised"
Idk why but I can see John Wall as a Dallas Jason Kidd type role to end his career
John wall.   I just got a feeling
"My 5’9”, white, baseball playing friend dropped like 25 points on John Wall in HS. That’s all."
"For sure, surprised you didn't say John Wall, but Beal definitely is an athlete in his own right!"
"Ryan Wittman was a phenomenon and a sort of folk hero at Cornell when I was in college. He and Jeff Foote seemed like they had a shot at the pros-- they had a nice tournament run where they beat Wisconsin and gave the John Wall-Boogie Cousins Wildcats a little bit of trouble in the sweet 16.  We were rooting hard for him; he could really fucking shoot it.  Anyway, I think he bounced around the D-league and Europe and now he's done."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
John Wall was a stud before his injuries
A few years back John Wall was like the second best guard in the east
"According to what I saw back then and the little I can find still online, Simmons was measured at 6’9.5”. Six inches from that is 6’3.5”, which is like John Wall or Bradley Beal. I don’t know how measurements have changed later, many people seem to have grown from their “unofficial official” heights from 2019, I think Zion, Tatum and Ingram are now listed taller than their pre-season measurements (maybe they grew, maybe teams have started fudging the numbers again, I have no idea)."
"John Wall in 2016/17 was getting MVP votes.  He was AMAZING.  When Kyrie demanded a trade, hes the guy I was hoping for."
maybe John Wall
"John Wall when healthy was a top 3 PG  Fans and sometimes teams overrate the hell out of assets.   Example if you’re a middling or average team that can trade for an allstar or allstar level player that will more than likely make you way better you should do it. That random 1st round pick you’re holding so dearly onto will likely never be as good as the player you’re trading for, and if you’re trading for a GOOD player you shouldn’t have to worry about the pick being incredibly high. For example the bulls basically trade Wendell Carter, Otto Porter Jr, a first round pick that will likely never be an allstar,  and Franz Wagner who will likely never be an allstar for Vucevic and they should and would do it again.   Another example could be that Heat pick from a few years ago. Teams thought they hit a gold mine with that one Heat pick and what did that turn into? 18th pick Tre Mann right?"
Isaiah Thomas did during his prime. John Wall too iirc
Trying to think outside the box here:  Alperen Sengun with John Wall speed and athleticism  Ja Morant with Steven Adams strength  Deandre Ayton with CP3 handle/playmaking
"John wall before the achillies, was one of his main moves. Also celtics Isaiah Thomas favored that move"
John Wall has some sick highlights
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"Neither the Lakers, nor the Nets make the NBA Finals.  The media turns on Giannis since he is content with staying with a small market team.  Klutch/Rich Paul becomes a major scandal overshadowing the actual basketball.  Luka wants out.  John Wall Redemption Tour.   Hey, let’s have fun, right?"
John Wall and Gilbert Arenas. I love both of them but sadly both of their careers got derailed at their peak by injuries.
"Saying Trae was the first to lead in scoring and assists is a lot of cherry-picking and fairly meaningless. Lots of other players were very close to leading in both, or simply did not have the needed play-style or were not on a team that would allow them to do that. By pure volume on counting stats he was excellent. I said his efficiency was not otherworldly but just solid. 36% from 3 and 58 TS% with his turnover rate even on high volume is very solid but not at all eye-popping. And it makes it more concerning how good he will be when he’s so small and lacks athleticism.  And if you want to go by just pure college stats, then his advanced stats in college were again solid but not amazing. A WS/40 of 0.20 is not that great. A PER of 28 is very good but fairly typical of a 5-10 pick or even lower. He wasn’t even top 10 that year in PER.  And again his size and lack of athleticism were huge concerns. He was smaller, shorter and less athletic than all of the guys you just mentioned. Russel is 6’4” and 195lbs with awesome athleticism. How does he compare to Young? Fox is 6’3” with much better athleticism and was also the 5th pick. Oladipo is 6’4”, 215lbs and an amazing athlete. John Wall, Westbrook and Rose are all taller and much heavier than Young and were ultra-explosive freak athletes. I don’t understand any of these comparisons. If Trae had the physique of any of these guys with the stats he put up he would have gone 1 or 2. The problem was that he didn’t have that physique so he fell to 5th, which is still very high.  Steph his freshman year would not have even been a first round pick and maybe not drafted at all. Though his efficiency and advanced states were still generally better than Trae. He wasn’t drafted until 2 years later when he was way better. And again it still took him 5 years on top of that to become an All-Star. Drafting Steph that high was still a small gamble. And it took a long time to actually pay off. Just because it then paid off massively doesn’t mean it wasn’t a small risk. And if he was taken something like #1 over Blake Griffin that would have been a gigantic, insane gamble. He ended up being way better than Griffin but that doesn’t mean it would have been a reasonable pick at the time."
"John Wall isn’t a decorated as Mitch,but I have no problem with the other two being Hall of Famers,and I think Stoudamire should definitely be in the HoF"
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."
"If that’s enough for an HoF resume, you’ve got guys like Amare Stoudamire, LaMarcus Aldridge, John Wall all making it in too. I raked through for guys kinda matching or even surpassing the stuff listed.  All decent players but HoF? I dunno"
I doubt that's guaranteed Reggie Jackson is fitting a lot better than John wall right now
"John Wall was bad last season. Any Rockets fan can tell you but he put him on a team with other stars and he’s gonna be decent.  He’s not gonna play the same role on a contending team. Also important to note that this was his first season after not playing basketball for two years. Most of his bad games came when Wood and Gordon were out, so he had to force things.  You’re over exaggerating a bit"
"You wrong, I watched every single John Wall game last season.  Lol if Kemba is getting a starting role on a playoff team, John Wall definitely will. His playmaking and defense is still valuble"
John Wall 20ppg 7apg on 40/31/75 32mpg Rajon Rondo 4ppg 3apg on 40/37/50 15mpg Playoff Rondo 4ppg 4apg 34/39/67 16mpg
Hate is blinding. John Wall is bad for his contract. But for the minimum??
What is wrong with you? You honestly think ZERO contenders would consider signing John Wall for the minimum? And Rondo was atrocious in the playoffs for the clippers he was a net negative and shot under 40%😂. So idk why you think me mentioning rondo is somehow wrong
The clippers would’ve benefited greatly from John Wall instead of Rondo this year
"Uhh Wall has been a standup community figure and doesn't have a scintilla of criminal history since he's been drafted , not a single thing.   [John Wall wins NBA Cares Community Assist Award](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/06/01/john-wall-wins-nba-cares-community-assist-award/)  Lemme guess you're scared of his ""image"" because he hangs out with rappers? Reddit kids.."
"John wall 2.0 already exists on the kings tho, are they going for a double wall scenario?"
"He was horribly inefficient this past season, which is saying something bc he’s never been the most efficient scorer. But he still has some nice burst and straight line speed, and still averaged 20 a game with a broken jumper and questionable shot selection. He can still get to the basket and be a secondary playmaker. I’d love to see him traded to a contending team that needs an elite backup point guard, or a team with a lot of shooters who needs a starting point guard.   My best fit for Wall at this point would be a team like the Nuggets tbh. He would be the secondary ball handler and playmaker behind Jokic, and would be the 3rd option/elite backup  once Murray comes back. They have a versatile lineup full of shooters and he would give them a nice spark. Don’t let this sub or his TS% convince you that the man can’t even dribble a basketball anymore. He had a meh or even bad year, but he still had plenty of great games and flashes of prime John Wall. 2 years missed in a row is a lot of rust.   Also in addition to the Nuggets, would love to see John Wall to the Clippers. They run a platoon at guard the last few years anyway, are a great 3 point shooting team, and they could use another playmaker/scorer/initiator while Kawhi is out. Wall and Reggie Jackson soaking up all the point guard minutes is decent, and could be good once the Clippers are at full strength.   Disclaimer: I know Wall’s contract is ridiculous which probably means he’s untradeable. But I would love to see him on the Nuggets or Clippers if they could make it work."
So Blake Griffin should've had his contract shrunk because the Clippers decided to trade him? Or John Wall? Russell Westbrook? The NBPA will never agree to it nor they should. It gives owners the chance to trade away players who get injured to reduce the wage bill and gives the players nothing. The contracts aren't designed that way right now and the player association would have to agree to make the change. Why would they agree to reduce their own power?
john wall
John wall
anyone from 6-7 ft with extra knee ligaments to spare?  I like John Wall in theory but in practice with Embiid just seems sketchy with all the knee issues.
Tyrese Maxey is better than this iteration of John Wall and he's already on the team. What a dumbass statement by Perk.
John Wall isn't the alternative. Kendrick Perkins is a fucking idiot that should be completely ignored.
"John wall has been a below average shooter is entire career, he is by definition a liability.  Russ was actually average early on.    Wall is at best an average defender so I don’t even know what he brings. Wall has never been as impactful as current Simmons outside his 2017 season. There is absolutely no benefit in replacing Simmons with post Achilles Wall. This is not even factoring injuries.   Wall shoots under 35% from outside 3 feet in his career."
What happened to John wall? I been ootl. I know he suffered an injury. Did the injury mess up his career?
"John Wall isn’t that shitty lol, 21 and 7 in his first season after 2 injuries, and players often come back better their second season after a knee injury   His stats are downgraded due to how bad the Rockets were"
"John Wall is a mediocre shooter who had bad splits due to playing for an awful Rockets team where he couldn’t create easy shots for himself. At the very least he’s not an outright liability like Simmons  He’s still a good playmaker, athletic, a better shooter and his defense isn’t a back-breaker either"
Don't forget [Blue Santa suit DeMar Derozan](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRqinh0XcAAt5oE.jpg:large) and [Gang Sign John Wall](https://youtu.be/lalTJ5XJRW8)
Im tired of the John Wall slander.  People act like his is washed as a player. Dude is still on of the fastest guards in the league. He's still a good facilitator.  If you ignore the contract he can still be helpful to a team.
When the alternative is John Wall? Yes it should.
The Simmons and Embiid pairing has become underrated. People already forgetting how good the 76ers were/are? Ben Simmons is an elite player until the 2nd round of the playoffs. John Wall is no longer an elite player at all.
John Wall is washed lol
Personally I think Joel Embiid is better in Philly with Joel Embiid than John Wall in Philly with Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons in Philly with Joel Embiid
"Today? or All time?  Today it would probably be something like CP3, LeBron, Harden and Jokic. Westbrook should be considered for this just by his raw numbers, but i have a hard time calling him a Top 5 passer, it's hard to argue with his stats though. John Wall was good pre injuries.  All-time is pretty straightforward: Magic is No.1 by a pretty decent margin, then it goes Stockton, Nash, CP3 and Kidd (i do think Kidd and CP3 were better players than Nash, but Nash was a better passer). Bob Cousy deserves a honorable mention, but it's hard to rate a guy that played 60 years ago, Rondo was amazing in his prime aswell."
John Wall/Gil Arenas
"Agent Zero, Brandon Roy, John Wall off the top of my head.   Kept playing but diminished roles/impact: D. Rose, Grant Hill, and Anfernee Hardaway.  I feel like you can include D Wade here too. He should've had a longer prime."
John Wall
"Players as a whole get a defined share of Revenue just like in the NBA.    When John Wall gets huge money, it just takes away from other players.  In the NFL, guys who aren't good anymore get cut,  and new guys get that money"
Allen Iverson was WAY better  Im thinking Mitch Richmond... Or Gilbert Arenas... Shareff Abdul Raheem... John Wall... Demarcus Cousins... Derrek Rose...  Grant Hill...
John Wall
If Houston could of turned John wall into Ben Simmons the trade would of already been made. Wall has the worst trade value contract in the league. This trade/post is ludicrous.
Wood is one of Stone's first major acquisitions and is a big feather in his cap.  He is likely seen as a major part of the core of a future contending iteration of the Rockets or there wouldn't be any reason for him to still be on the team at this point.  But yeah... Clips would probably trade for John Wall if the deadline were today.
"Allen Iverson? He played 12 years of elite ball, dude was 33 when he went to Detroit and got hurt. Newton is 32 and hasn't been the same the last 3 years maybe even 4. Newton had such a short time of peak top tier football too. You gotta go with someone like John wall or arenas, Brandon Roy. Klay Thompson would be another one. Iverson though had a solid career and for the amount of punishment he took and injuries he played through, 12 years is plenty long of elite level play."
John Wall
"Cam won an MVP pretty early then was derailed by injuries. I feel like it’s gotta be D Rose, I could maybe see John Wall too."
John wall is in the same spot as Cam right now except he’s on a huge deal because nba gives their players more security.
I was going to say John Wall but yeah D Rose is pretty spot on
John Fooken Wall
"So many to choose from. Steve Francis, John Wall, Gilbert Arenas, Shawn Kemp…list could go on. Penny Hardaway was one that was disappointing - really wanted to see what he could do. Grant Hill and Tracey McGrady had long enough careers to be considered great."
"To be fair NFL players who rely somewhat on athleticism like Cam (even though he was really a pocket passer who would turn scrambles into big gains) drop off much, much faster in the NFL than the NBA. Cam’s drop off can be comparable to John Wall but there’s also the argument to be made that if Westbrook starts to drop off faster with the Lakers the timelines will be pretty similar between the two."
"I swear, when John wall was healthy and they were starting to put it together in the playoffs, I really think they could have added one more piece and gone all the way. He made his teams winners and his injuries messed all of it up and destroyed his psyche IMO."
John Wall maybe? Derrick rose comp above was good
John Wall
John Wall  Injuries have really fucked him him up and he doesn’t seem to care to change his style of play
Also John Wall
John Wall?
John Wall?
John Wall...
"Yeah I understand your worries, I feel the same sometimes. Before the draft, I compared Scottie to other athletic wings combine numbers. By far, he posted better results across the board compared with Siakam, Oubre, Adebayo. He is slightly better than A. Gordon as well, who imo is the most athletic 3/4. The only guy his size who's slightly more athletic is Ben Simmons. He literally has similar combine numbers to John Wall.   He needs to develop a respectable jumpshot and improve his handles. Also, playing on a good shooting team will open the floor for him. When that happens, you'll see his half court game improve"
Is it fair to call Dame generational when he shoots it at 37.5% clip for his career? I understand that he shoots them at high volume and from deep but it just doesn’t seem quite good enough. Dames career high is 40.1%. Curry (who is obviously generational and the 🐐 shooter) averages 43.3% for his career by comparison and hasn’t shot it lower than 41.1% (excluding his 5 game season 2 years ago). Klay at a career 41.9%.   The difference between Steph and Dames career 3pt% is bigger than the difference between Dame and John Wall (32.3%). All that to say I’m not sure if Dame is a generational shooter (much as you are also on the fence).
"Honestly, I don't think he was as bad as he played. He was still knocking off rust and was encouraged to over shoot as a tank commander. On a team like the Clips I think he would tone back the shots and pass more which he is still very good at. I was less than impressed with his defense but yet again that's more conditioning and not wanting to give his all to the worst team in the league. Also, for some reason people seem to think the John Wall is a Westbrook or Simmons level shooter. Below is some [3pt shooting stats](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/numbers-john-wall-sees-himself-playing-ball-alongside-improved-bradley-beal) from recent years.  2018-19 Overall 3PT%: 30.2 Catch and shoot 3s: 37.3 Pull-up 3s: 20.6  2017-18 Overall 3PT%: 37.3 Catch and shoot 3s: 43.8 Pull-up 3s: 31.3  2016-17 Overall 3PT%: 33 Catch and shoot 3s: 35.9 Pull-up 3s: 30.5  2015-16 Overall 3PT%: 35.4 Catch and shoot 3s: 38.4 Pull-up 3s: 31.3  On catch and shoot 3pt shots Wall is a serviceable shooter. You cannot just leave him open. Because of this I don't expect Wall to damage spacing as much as people seem to expect. Would he be maximized by being the worst shooter on the floor? Yes, it would open up his driving far more. However, you can still play Wall with traditional centers.  I should add that I still don't think the Clips should gut the roster for him and I don't think the Rockets are buying him out."
"Basketball is a team sport, John Wall is still really good."
I’d add Prime John Wall to that list
John Wall
"man your franchise should take John Wall instead, not us clippers ty"
Yes. John Wall could make the clippers with a healthy kawhi the betting favorites for the NBA finals.  The clippers will never unlock even the top 25% of their potential without an impact PG. John Wall can do just enough I think
"If John Wall turns down a guaranteed $47M next year for a better situation, he needs to be checked for concussions."
"If John Wall goes to the Clippers, then they become much easier to defend."
John Wall was actually pretty decent last year tbh. He was just chucking
This post seems to hinge on the idea that John Wall can get back to pre-injury form which seems highly unlikely.
John Wall on 44m a season doesn't make sense for anyone
Part of the reason those shooters shot over 40% was because there wasn't a John Wall type on the floor.  There's a reason those guys shot as much as 9 percentage points above their career averages.
"Imma just say, 4 shooters (40+%) and John Wall attacking sounds like a good strategy to me."
"Don't worry, he's being treated very well.  Stone sat John Wall so he could start.  He's gonna win MIP this year."
John Wall wherever he lands after Houston
"That situation is so weird  Wall got two more years of his last big bag and the Rockets don't plan on using him at all cause they got promising players in need of control of the offense.  He's definitely not cool with the bench cause that way he can't show that he still has value, might end up like Thomas.  And for the Rockets, keep him rotting on the bench collecting big money is stupid.  I read the post about the team and John having agreed into this but imo that's a front, like you said, Rockets is trying to finesse someone into trading for him.  They need it to work or else we might see the biggest buyout ever."
I dont think John Wall does much for them
"&gt;they were basically a small ball, five out, everybody shoots, everybody shares type of team.  Exactly? What makes you think that John Wall, one of the best slashers and passers at finding open shooters, wouldn't fit on a team this well spaced?"
"There are actual areas he would fit. In terms of adding another driver of the basket (which we lacked for 80% of the year last year) he does so. Bledsoe is better defensively but John Wall is a better playmaker who averaged 7 assist with some of the worst spacing in the league. While I don't love Serge as a starter a lineup of John Wall, PG, Reggie, Ibaka and Morris works because Wall no longer has to take poor shots. He's surrounded with some of the best spacing in the league and can actually focus on defensive side of ball with another year removed from a major injury.   It's not perfect but I do think it works because as much as I enjoyed PG's improved playmaking relying on him to be the best playmaker on the team for an entire season can lead to him not looking to score as much. When PG was a #1 option with a point guard who handled the ball alot and was able to get him to his spots he had his best regular season year. As long as he drove the ball and cutdown on the bad shots I could definitely see John Wall having a 15/8 type of season on decent efficiency while being a solid defender."
"John Wall has always played really ambidextrously in general. Great at passing with his offhand, and would dunk with his off hand more than any guard I have ever seen."
"Kemba Walker was an all star in 2020, John Wall hasn't played meaningful minutes in 3 years.  Wall doesn't 'move the needle' for any team at this point in his career."
A floor general is always necessary for a championship team and John Wall has enough shooting around him to operate in the paint and transition.
"Does John Wall really move the needle with this team?  When they didn't have Kawhi, they were basically a small ball, five out, everybody shoots, everybody shares type of team.    Does John Wall really fit into that type of scheme?"
Look up how many knee surgeries John wall has had since 2017. I believe that number is 5.  Do you understand why he’s played 37% of his games on his super max?
They deliberately have chosen young cheap reclamation projects for this coming season. A John Wall buyout would definitely fit.
"They've got John Wall at home, Reggie Jackson who shoots 40% from three now too. I'm not sure where else they should use the aggregated salaries, but i don't think the answer is John Wall."
In a league with a salary cap you have to look at a player in the context of their contract.  John Wall is literally the 2nd highest paid player in the league so if he’s not producing at a high level he’s not worth his contract.   In a no-cap league like MLB it would be different.
"Because I say ""like""? Lmaooooo  And the point is that John Wall is the worst contract in the league. Healthy ibaka is a positive value, which makes him alone extremely more valuable than John Wall hahahah.  Like the fleecing that this deal would be, would be all time."
He's a supermax player.  Healthy Ibaka is worth wayyyyy more alone than the potential upside of a healthy john wall hahahah.  Mans shot 40% on 18 shots per game... Like what's the expectation? Dumbbbb
They literally break the ground and John Wall pops out. “Wtf took y’all so long?”
"Why would anyone assume that?  The last time he played even close to a full season, he was 26. He's now 31...  Like if the Clippers did this, they'd deserve to be a laughing stock lol. Destroy their bench to pay John wall $90 million hahah."
Add in the fact John Wall was seen clubbing in LA with PG lol
"For real though. I understand the take, and Andre was just contributing to the conversation and to Steph's legacy which I totally get, but I don't really think of Steph being that much of a driving force to that notion. Dwight is a good example, Jason Williams though he's a bit of a ways back.. Lance Stephenson more recently, Dirk with that big smile and tongue out.  And think of all the signature player celebrations that have been around! Jason Terry jet, John Wall dougie and flex, tons of 'em. Steph contributes to the fun, and his star power helps that impact, but I don't think of him changing the game too much in that facet at least."
"He's the second highest paid player in the league. He has barely played over the last 3 seasons. He's 31. Ruins their flexibility. Kawhi is going to miss the whole year. He's not good. His upside is a role player.  So no, I would not trade 3 smaller contracts that are much easier move for supermax John Wall lmaooooo"
"You wouldn’t trade Ibaka with back issues, a bad point guard, and over paid Kennard for John Wall who is getting back into shape?"
Why would either team do this trade? The Clipps would have to send out at least Bledsoe+Morris+Filler to match salaries +picks. Houston has no use for any of those players and the picks are limited/garbage. Is the ghost of John wall worth Bledsoe+Morris+Filler?
Okay?  No one is trading for John Wall. Do the math on how many players LA would need to send back.
"I'm just saying, we're all a part of this moment. We're in the comments of a john wall story.  It's what the people want."
"We’re in the negative years when talking about John walls knees, no team should consider John wall unless it’s a buy out."
They could literally just talk about other team’s expectations this season. Instead they spent 20 minutes talking about John Wall trades…
"A few weeks from now: Huh strange after John wall got bought out, Tillman suddenly got gifted Microsoft stock by an unnamed individual."
"there's a world in which john wall is.... actually good for the sixers. just going to be a race between who gets injured first, embiid or wall."
Sixers need to consider that John Wall trade.   Theyre in win-now mode and also needs scoring. They have about 2-3yrs left before Embiid's knees are toast.
John Wall busting through the doors next
John Wall underrated
"That’s a pretty crazy coincidence though you gotta admit.  That aside, John Wall would be a pretty good addition for the Clippers."
Bah Gawd that's John Wall music!
They add up to one John Wall.  (But that's reading too far into it)
Wow. They’re being traded for John Wall.
John wall for Olajuwon?. Yes please
Let’s chill with the recency bias lmao Chris Paul was looked at like John Wall in 2019
"Trading Beal for Prime John Wall? I think he’s the best. Maybe Prime Gil? Or Unseld probably.   Tough, but I think I would trade Beal for Prime John Wall."
Please trade for John Wall.
"BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   I know you aren’t trying to hype up a post Achilles tear John Wall as anything more than the worst contract in the league that would require multiple protected firsts to move. Wall has played 41 games since Christmas 2018 and no more than 41 in a season since 2016-17. He averaged 20.6 points last season on 40/32/75 shooting splits, the worst efficiency of anyone who took at least 14 shots per game. The only player making more money than him is Steph Curry lmao."
Can I interest you in a slightly-used John Wall?
Gordon is definitely good enough to win us games  This sub has forgotten easily but he’s a very good player  John Wall is washed tho
"&gt; Wtf, literally my two favorite teams  Ew, how is that possible. I hope you only became an NBA fan in the last 2 years. Because both of these teams were the antithesis of enjoyable basketball from 2015 - 2019.  Wizards for many years were bunch of goons and dirty players with an ugly offense that bragged about losing in the first round. Marcus Morris, Mike Scott, John Wall, Gortat, even old Paul Pierce. It's like the bad boys Pistons but if they lost in the first round and still talked shit.  The Houston ""literally third reich"" Rockets with Harden and CP3 and Morey were arguably worse though. Watching Harden dribble for 20 seconds and then attempt to draw a foul on a 24ft three pointer by hooking defenders arms 20 possessions a game was the worst basketball viewing experience ever. Even worse than the 00s Spurs. Basketball gods were protecting the integrity of the sport when the Rockets missed 27 threes in a row in game 7. Thank you James Naismith 🙏"
"**Let the clock run out**  Eric Gordon is being paid $18,218,818  in 2021-22 and $19,568,360 in 2022-23.   Similarly, John Wall is being paid $44,310,840 in 2021-22 and $47,366,760 in 2022-23.   Neither Wall nor Gordon are good enough to start winning them games. Play them off the bench, let your young core develop and run out the clock on their contracts"
Rudy Gay is straight  John Wall is a human person  Tim Duncan shot a lot of jumpers and layups  Kevin Love only likes a lot of people
"Chucker? Westbrook is a chucker, John Wall is a chucker, generally people that can't shoot well and lack in mechanics to be able to make shots consistently. Kobe was far from it but obviously didn't have many looks he didn't like, which affected his TS inevitably m"
"Yeah, except Beal's been in the league 9 years. If he hasn't been with prime John wall for half of that time, that's a long time"
"H-Town, John Wall was a good tank commander but now it’s time to get serious and trade up to Ben."
"he only gets the money if he plays or it least show up, he is not showing up and doesn’t want to play, guaranteed money is in cases like John Wall, he got injured but he still got paid"
Wasn't it skip who said John Wall can't be a leader cause he didn't have a dad?
"The offer was Thybulle, Ben and 3 protected firsts. That deal is garbage especially when it’s 2 guys who are only good at 1 side of the ball and sure as shit wasn’t the offensive side, neither can really shoot when we already have John Fucking Wall as our PG. But naw asking for Maxey was too much despite to ask for when having the other 2 would make you question if spacing even exists."
Future sixers legend john wall
"Hes a negative asset due to being completely overpaid. Klove, john wall are worse, but Wiggins is def overpaid."
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
[Rockets training camp roster just dropped](https://twitter.com/rockets_insider/status/1442187547384369152?s=21) and I still can’t believe r/KPJ is 7 lbs lighter and the same height as John Wall (6’4”) 👀…
"If you look at the last 20 years the average number one pick ends up being I think John wall, so multiple times all star and at their Peak a near top 10 player, so yeah fultz is a bust"
Future Rockets legend John Wall
"those aren't good examples at all in my opinion. Westbrook was moved for 3 future 1sts and 2 pick swaps for the thunder.     And John wall was moved for westbrook who just netted them quality role players who could convert to more assets at the deadline. Kuzma, KCP and Harell. That's after Wall had basically been injured for 2 straight seasons. If these guys left in FA both those teams would be in much worse positions than if they had signed the super max."
"the supermax sucks for middling franchises because you generally overspend on good talent, just look at westbrook and john wall"
"I think we forget how special John Wall was on the defensive end, too."
John Wall still can't shoot
"Depends on what you value more between floor raising and ceiling raising. Not many point guards I'd rather have isolate for a game winner, or play as on off guard with a great forward. But, there's also guys I'd rather have run 20 pick and rolls with every night.   Honestly Kyrie has always been a confounding player. Back when he vs John Wall was a big debate circa 2014 a lot of people argued Wall was the better 'point guard' got his teammates better etc, but the Cavs pre-Bron would have better half court offenses off the back of Irving just being an offensive dynamo. Sometimes we gotta remember a player's individual stats don't matter as much as their team's stats when they're on the court. (ex Harden turnovers, his are often high but the Rockets as a team, were low)  Guys effect the game in different ways, I really think supporting cast plays a big role in whether I'd want Iriving or the 5 point guards you might have ahead of him."
"Prime John Wall was a great PG, but we've seen time and time again that athletic point guards with shaky jumpshots have a hard time finding playoff success. When the game slows down and you're forced into half court offense, it becomes hard to score and win with a PG who can't reliably drain 3's."
"Held back to being prime John Wall, who peaked  at being a 4.7 BPM player, which is a definite all star."
More like young John Wall vibes
Is De’Aaron Fox John Wall without injuries?
"He can still be a very good player, just not for you guys anymore. That much is clear.   &gt;Malik Beasley as the best player in a package.  You mean a 24 year old 20ppg scorer making 15m/y?  &gt; We'll never have to attach picks and stuff just to get off his contract  After a year or two that's exactly what will happen. You'll be asking teams who haven't seen him play for 2 years to take a gamble on him the same way the Wizards (and now Rockets) have asked teams to take a gamble on John Wall.   ""We can just hold onto him forever"" and ""he'll cave and come back to play at a high level"" aren't realistic expectations.  40m on the bench in street clothes is 40m on the bench in street clothes."
"Oh yeah. Because John Wall, D-Lo, or the other trash offers will definitely beat the Nets, Heat, Bucks, etc."
Was that John Wall at the end?
Yeah the owners always win. Poor players have no power at all. That's why washed up overpaid players like Kevin Love or John Wall can just get cut by the team and lose the hundreds of millions they get for doing nothing. Oh wait...
"Conduct detrimental to the team, further fines. He wants to show up fat and out of shape, potentially a reason Harden was hurt and missed out on a championship? Just potentially. I doubt he wants that result. It appears his other two options are Minnesota and Cleveland? He really must hate the playoffs then. He has 4 years left, there is zero urgency to move him unless the right offer comes around. It can get toxic but Philly shouldn’t settle for something like John Wall or some role players from other teams."
You guys should watch the entire video. It’s actually pretty entertaining with Iso Joe cooking and John wall talking shit to jaylen brown   https://youtu.be/ljQrRhnYTfA
John wall hasn't been mentioned. He is 100% the biggest cornerstone who got destroyed by injuries
Damn John Wall was cooking
"Scares me how soft everyone nowadays is - you get some criticism/feedback, and your preference is to just leave? Not show out and win everyone over? That mentality is going to have massive consequences in life. Any normal employee woulda been fired lol. Ben hasn’t accomplished enough to act like this, but apparently the sub thinks differently. I’d sit on it and fine him if I was Philly, I am not taking John Wall or something like that for Ben just because he wants out. You signed for five years, coulda signed for less, now show up or take these fines."
"The difference is PG didn’t play any games. He didn’t demand a trade and ghost the FO. He came to them with a very specific trade request that set them up to have one of the best futures in the league due to the circumstances around them. Ben basically did the exact opposite of that lmao.  KD literally took pay cuts to play in GS. Winning was the biggest priority for him. Not money.   John wall requested a trade actually. A week or so before he was traded. And being traded is a part of the NBA business. Players are assets. Employees. They can be moved as players see fit. It’s a specifically written part of their contract, which is why no trade clauses exist.   And no this situation is on Ben being an entitled diva and getting pissy his limitations were rightfully criticized, after he hasn’t improved an ounce offensively since his rookie year despite his glaring weaknesses. Pop, nurse, doc, Phil Jackson etc have rightfully criticized their players to the media. All of their players took it professionally and worked hard to improve their games. But not Ben. His entitled ass decided to bail on the team that’s blindly supported him and accepted his limitations for years"
"&gt; There’s also a big difference between formally requesting a trade, and refusing to play or contact the team outright.  Yeah the difference is the PG trade went down almost as soon as it was requested. Morey has dragged this out the entire offseason because he cares about getting the biggest haul not trying to build a contender.     &gt;Durant left the thunder cause the warriors offered him a guaranteed ring.    Yes but if it was under current circumstances he was unlikely to have left huge money on the table to test free agency. At the time, the Thunder could off him the exact same max contract as any other team with space. This is why the supermax is good.   In terms of Simmons, this is run of the mill. John Wall wanted to stay in Washington and what happened? Blake Griffin was ready to retire a clipper and what happened? For every Simmons there's another case of teams cutting guys loose who they promised the world too.   This situation and ADs are both on the GMs. If the guy is serious about the trade request in private don't play with your food and make a move. Many teams have handled such situations without fuss."
"i think nba players would have a much easier time being elite at mid to short distance running, but not necessarily sprinting. maybe 400m to 5k on the outside, track conditions only. young lebron would have torched the 800, i feel like curry could currently with 6 months to a years worth of training might be able to run like 15s or mid 14s for 5k, with maybe a sub 4, or close to 4 flat 1500m. russ could probably kill a 400m. there might be some really good long jumpers too. john wall in his prime could have probably run a decent 200m.   but at the same time they are stop and go endurance athletes, and running is consistent, so it might be similar to how lung capacity for swimming means nothing for running, and visa versa. i bet deaaron fox could run a fast 400m. klay might be the only one who could run a marathon, simply because he would approach it with a fuck it, why not attitude, and just mentally not be fazed. probably not sub 4, but he is an elite athlete so who knows."
Why the hell would the Warriors want John Wall? Especially with that atrocious contract
John Wall gotta do a better job at defending him in the post
"My guess is you’re talking about a dude like John Wall who is probably itching to be traded just cause he likes playing. You don’t see a difference in that attitude and Ben’s? Buddy is getting benched cause he’s too good to tank but the team ain’t good enough to contend.  So people feel different ways about different situations? Yeah, I guess they do. I’d 100% rather have John Wall on a bad contract on my team than Ben Simmons on a good one. Cause one has character and tries and one doesn’t give af."
"we will give you 1 washed up John Wall and Nets first and MIL first and 1 second round pick and GSW second round pick, also Danuel House for free  please say yes"
"The biggest issue is that Lin did not get a ""ring rust"" season like every other player who ever had a name in the league got. He returned from injury and then all of a sudden was expected to play perfectly. Yet we give players like John Wall a chance and Klay will get at least 2 seasons of ring rust seasons."
"As a Lakers and Knicks fan, he was the opposite of the stereotypes. Everyone expected an short, unathletic player that plays smart. He was an tall, athletic player that played dumb.  For some perspective: Lin's first step was second in his draft behind only John Wall. If he's surrounded by shooters and a pick and roll partner, Lin can shine. But 3&amp;D's are expensive."
He absolutely did not improve the Rockets   We were better both 2018 and 2019. And the Wizards barely but John Wall and Beal Wizards proved to be able to get into the playoffs and that’s before Beal to another step
"I was thinking bout this during my run, why didn't the Lakers go after John Wall? Feel like he'd have been a better fit overall."
Who fits better with LeBron (currently): John Wall or Russell Westbrook?
"HYPOTHETICAL: If the Lakers offer Russ to the Rockets for John Wall straight up, would the Rockets agree to it?"
"It's always been sensationalized and will continue to be. I don't understand the ""new"" part.  In the 1980s there were like Kevin Johnson, John Stockton, Magic, Bird, Isaiah.  1990s had Stockton, Kevin Johnson, and a plethora of point forwards like Penny, Grant Hill, Scottie, and Detlef Shrempf.  2000s speaks for itself with Nash, Kidd, CP3, Chauncey, Parker.  2010s had Lebron, CP3, Westbrook, Harden, Wall, Rondo  2020s look promising with Jokic, Luka, Ja, Trae, Lamelo.  Edit: Only the players that came to mind, not necessarily the best of each decade."
Ain't nothing wrong with John Wall.
boi plz i been watching since before john wall and demarcus cousins were the dream
of course he'll get a max. They gave John Wall a max with his leg falling off.
We’re going to have to settle for John Wall lmfao
John Wall made All-NBA team only once. All-NBA Third team.   At his peak he was two tiers below all those players you listed.
"Athletic freaks like Giannis and LeBron though? 5'3"" Muggsy Bogues an athletic freaks without untold amounts of hard work? CP3 was never the most athletic guy. A better comp would've been young Deron Williams. These guys aren't even athletic freaks in their own position. Westbrook, DRose, John Wall are athletic freaks."
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
"what about for john wall.  kyrie winds up on the rockets a year later, wall and harden reunited in brooklyn."
"You can improve your depth perception, muscle memory and coordination, you cannot improve your vertical to jump like Kawhi or quickness to run like John Wall. These are genetic, same with kawhis big ass hands.  &gt; then why has no one been able to come close to his shooting numbers?   why doesn't every 6'6 athletic freak become as good as MJ/Kobe? It's not that simple. Some people don't have the drive. Some people don't understand the game as well as others.   I think there are players that come close to curry, like Lillard. But it's more likely that we'll see Curry copycats, than MJ copycats.   You can't seriously think vertical and athleticism can be learnt the same way shooting ability and coordination can."
"I was high on Klay and Devin Booker during their college careers and was super happy to see how they panned out. However, I was also super high on Austin Rivers before his draft. Not a complete bust, but definitely nowhere near as good as I thought he would be. My worst was definitely believing that Kendall Marshall was the next Rondo.   Also, no one will probably believe me, but I used to hype up Jeremy Lin all the time before Linsanity lmao. I remember leaving a comment on an old YouTube highlight video of John Wall and Jeremy Lin playing each other in Summer League. Claimed he had what it took to be a solid starting point guard in the league. Can’t find that comment anymore. But it was an incredible feeling when Linsanity happened."
That's quite a funny example given Tillman is paying John Wall not to play!
"I can't find the video, but there was a play where Harden intentionally threw the ball about ten feet behind John Wall in the backcourt. Wall damn near had to dive to keep it from going out of bounds. He dribbles the ball for a few seconds staring at Harden like ""what the f*@$ is wrong with you!?""   Not to mention Harden slandering them all press conferences before and after he left. I'd be shocked if they're on great terms."
Could see Houston or Cleveland trading for him. If he retires you get a nice salary dump for Kevin Love/John Wall
"Cleveland probably would consider it for Kevin Love, same with Houston and John Wall."
"Dallas has the superstar power for a trade like that but they aren't giving up Luka for the headache of Kyrie, Cuban is too smart for that. San Antonio don't have the assets to make a decent offer. Only team is the Rockets as they have players with money contracts like John Wall and young talent they could potentially offload for Kyrie trade. I guess it's a matter of how willing the nets are to get rid of Kyrie for a win now situation while also potentially upsetting your two remaining stars in KD and Harden by trading a friend away. And factoring in no trade clauses Kyrie could potentially have in his contract."
"Harden left Houston to not play with John wall, doubt him and KD would sign off on that"
Take it from someone who watched him last year; John Wall sucks. I don’t think the Nets want him.
"Assuming Kyrie will retire if traded and that John Wall is vaccinated, Kyrie to Houston could work well for both teams. Rockets are already paying Wall to not play."
John Wall
Only for a bad contract.  Teams might take on the Kyrie circus to get out from under John Wall or Kevin Love or something.
"Wrong --   Jimmer:  Thought he was a future NBA MVP.  Turned out being a CBA MVP, so I wasn't too far off.  Just one letter.    Thought Nerlens Noel and Okafor were going to be amazing together...like Robinson and Duncan or something.    I thought something similar to Kyle Korver's career was Booker's absolute ceiling.  I thought MKG and James Young were perennial all stars, and they aren't even perennial players.    Embiid:  Watched him in college and he was just obviously so new to the game.  It didn't make sense to me why so many people were so high on him.  Wiggins:  Thought he was drastically better than Embiid at Kansas.  He's still a good player, just obviously a wrong take.    AD:  Expected him to be good, but really thought he wasn't going to be anywhere near as good as John Wall or Demarcus Cousins.      Right (not many) --  Draymond:  I couldn't comprehend how he ended up as a second round pick.  Seemed like an obvious perennial all star the way he owned the court at Michigan State.    Bennett:  I couldn't comprehend how anyone looked at this dude and thought he had a higher ceiling than role player."
John wall music
"Teams will be too scared to give up anything of value for Kyrie.  Not only is he a total head case who can opt out of his contract after this year, but he's on record saying he'd retired if traded and on record saying he doesn't plan on having a long career in this league.    Like yeah - they can trade him for a bad contract like John Wall, but that's about it."
John Wall
John Wall
Hes going to be traded for john wall. Then kyrie will retire and be off the books.
"John Wall, Kevin love, deangelo Russell, Andrew wiggins, Ben Simmons, kristaps porzingis... you taking all these guys over BI ?"
Morey isn’t that stupid to take a John wall contract
The day we land ~~Dame Beal Edwards Brogdon~~ John Wall 😏
It was enough to make Wall and Cousins confront him:   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/john-wall-demarcus-cousins-confronted-james-harden-during-rockets-meeting-prior-to-trade-per-report/       He could have handled his exit a lot more professionally.
John Wall still exists
Just trade him for John Wall already.  It’s going to happen eventually.
"No, it’s like what harden did last year  What John wall and the rockets are doing is kind of like a mutual decision. Both sides don’t want each other, but are working on it. Rockets don’t want him to play. Wall wants out."
i would literally take any other offer before i took john wall
"Probably. Like what John Wall is doing with the Rockets. The difference is the Rockets team, players, and fans actually seem to like Wall."
John wall for Simmons make it happen morey
Not so fast. We got one John Wall to trade. Kyrie can happily retire too
Do you want to get traded for John Wall again?  Because that’s how you get traded for John Wall again.
NY will regress back to a lottery team and Chicago will take their place as the 4th seed.  Kyrie Irving will get traded to Houston for John Wall. Irving won’t report and Houston don’t care.
"John wall was the 2nd best pg in the league in 2017 (yes over, kyrie, cp3 and westbrook)"
"Westbrook or John Wall, I'm serious."
"Of course he does. John wall was a college phenom and his trend was high as hell going into the draft. Had incredible speed and agility, while also having crazy finishing ability. Many though the would refine his shot more and keep ascending."
"Dude, I deal sportscards for a living. Been at it professionally or semi-professionally since around 2004. John Wall generated very little interest in the industry from the get go. There was middling hype on the guy when he was drafted. I would rate it equal to Derrick Rose in terms of interest from the public. He was the clear top rookie in a rather weak class and that drove a decent amount of money to him as the season went on, but very little in terms of his draft issues. By and large all of the interest that year was in Blake Griffin after his injury. Compared to the hype for Simmons it's comical. The amount of money that was being poured into every Simmons release as it came on the market was record breaking at the time. Fuck, Simmons hype is responsible for the entire Prizm craze beginning. Simmons was being hyped as a 15 year old in Australia as the future #1 pick and the successor to LBJ. His commitment to LSU was front page news. I don't know how you can sit here with a straight face and tell me John fucking Wall was considered a better prospect on draft day. You want to argue Kyrie with me, fine. Argue Kyrie with me. I think you're wrong. But Simmons just makes you look dumb."
Different John Wall
I love no where close to Kentucky and don’t ever watch college ball and I knew who John wall was for like 3-4 years before he got drafted. I think you’re really underestimating the hype
"It’s too late, once I saw a post about prime John wall I immediately got sad. I wish he didn’t get injured"
"I was in his graduating class for HS and he didn't didn't seem human. Like I had seen lots of the greats play in person or against, from hs all the way up to nba, and John wall coming out of hs looked like a literal cheat code. His highlight tapes left all our jaws on the floor every time we saw em"
"Pre-injury John Wall was reaching a top 3 point guard in the league status at one point. The dude was genuinely unstoppable.  Sincerely, My unbiased opinion"
do the john wall
"Hear me out trade him for John wall.  Contract wise it is close enough to work. Kyrie is gonna retire if he gets traded to Houston so that frees up cap space. John wall can be a serviceable PG for the nets and be back up to their main stars.  All comes down to would you rather an average player for ever game or a bitch that's nice for half of them.  Also, Kyrie is def fucking up the dressing room vibe. Imagine how Mills is feeling knowing he's not starting at home games for this chump"
Kentucky John Wall is one of the most electrifying players I've seen. Yes.
"I don’t know if this is sarcasm, but they made Cade dougie literally yesterday   And yes John Wall is way better at it  https://twitter.com/jledwardsiii/status/1446941916634001412?s=21"
Yes.  John Wall was one of the best point guards in college basketball history and was an incredibly high-rated prospect out of high school. Not a lot of players you can pick over him.
"Oh yes the perennial contender John Wall playoff era, who could ever forget /s."
"Kobe Bryant  Allen Iverson  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetakoumpo  Hakeem Olajuwon   Honorable Mentions:  Rod Strickland, John Wall, and Bradley Beal"
"John Wall is a text book example of good stats-bad team and is a straight up locker room killer, Fox knows his place and is a meaningful 3rd option.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jr4Qf_6oE  Game of Zones nailed it. Making John Wall your #1 or #2 inherently holds your team back. Maybe watch some actual basketball nephew."
"**TLDR**: Shockingly enough the rebuilding Rox don't have an open spot for him b/c there are too many promising young guys, and entrenched starters + rotation players.  I know we're rebuilding and it feels like we should have an open sport for him, but we legitimately don't unless he wants to sign a 2-way(Bey and Lamb are the current ones but can be cut).  We're already down to 14 playable roster spots instead of 15 b/c of John Wall effectively being an assistant coach the entire year barring a miracle buyout or trade.   Plus we drafted 4 rookies in the 1st rd, 1 who's a guaranteed starter(Green), 1 who earned himself rotation minutes(Sengun) and 2 who look promising but are gonna be in RGV a lot(Christopher and Garuba). That leaves 10 roster spots to work with.  9 of those 10 roster spots are starters/rotation players on gtd contracts who aren't fighting for a roster spot: Gordon, CWood, Theis, Augustin, Nwaba, DHouse, KPJ, KMJ, and Tate.   Then we got 3 guys battling in training camp for the 14th spot: Exum who's on the weird incentive based contract built for trades, fan favorite sharpshooter Armoni Brooks who's on an Exhibit 10 but is prolly getting a 2 way spot, and Daishen Nix on an Exhibit 10 as well.  Including the two 2-way guys, that's 19 out of the 20 guys we had on our training camp roster since we cut Khyri Thomas, who was on a non-gtd contract, to do the Sekou trade.   In the grand scheme Sekou doesn't fit in that mix which is why he got waived. In spite of Sekou's theoretical potential, I just don't see a world where he makes the final 14 man roster over Exum w/his tradeable contract, or Armoni Brooks w/his elite shooting."
Sign John Wall on the vet min once he gets bought out
"Seriously. I absolutely love Fox and stan for him pretty hard, but it's not even an argument. Peak John Wall was a borderline top-10 player in the NBA, and was commonly listed as the first or second best PG in the NBA after Curry and CP3. Fox still has work to do to stand up to that."
"Prime John Wall was a beast, people must've forgot how good Wall was pre-injuries."
Never followed the Wizards close enough to get a good taste of prime John Wall but it felt like the window was small due to all the injuries.
You’d rather have Fox on your team than Prime John Wall? Delusional
"I do think Scottie Barnes will be compared to Ben Simmons the same way we compare Fox to John Wall.  Not quite an all-star, but a better player to have on your team and build alongside."
"What's the John Wall one after,dude looked like he was breaking down."
"I feel like some are really specialized, ever seen John Wall throw a baseball"
"his list is dumb...blake griffin wasn't even playing in the nba during Pau's finals run lol. John wall only came into the league in 2011...  bunch of other bad additions in that list. sure all those players were really good at some point, but not the time that we're talkinga bout (Pau's 3 years during the finals run)"
lol you obviously have no idea what you'er takling about as blake griffin didn't even play 2010-2011...are you just trolling?  john wall also only started playin in 2011...so you're taking rookie john wall over prime Pau?  why are you taking LMA over Pau? also Paul pierce? joe johnson?
"Pau definitely better than a sophomore Kevin Love, a not drafted until 2010 John Wall, and a Blake Griffin who was injured his rookie season lmao"
"Lebron James,  Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
"I think only player Nets could trade Kyrie for is John Wall, and it actually mighty be their lucky way out of this shitty situation if it keeps progressing worse."
I remember last season when the John Wall &gt; Westbrook takes were HOT.   People should know better but hey its fun to get these jokes off.
"Such a shame. If Kyrie does intend to retire if being traded, then they might as well trade him for John Wall or Kevin Love. The Cavs and Rockets are the only teams who are looking to get these players off their books but won’t buy them out."
"We are a league where teams go all-in on second-tier All-Stars just for a shot at staying relevant. Kristaps Porzingis is making $32 mil this season, Paskal Siakam is making $33M, Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are making $36M. John Wall is making $44M.  Yes, Westbrook is inefficient, but he is a MVP winner, and so he got paid like one. I don't see anything wrong with that. I certainly don't see him as overpaid. He got paid exactly what he was worth in this league at the time."
John Wall? He’s on the team still lol
"I don’t think any trade can be the worst trade of the decade if the worst outcome is you gave up a decent role player. Chris Paul for Westbrook was pretty bad, they gave up 2 FRPs and 2 swaps that now have some actual value, then a year later Chris Paul was able to be flipped for essentially a first, Poku and what ended up being like 4 SRPs while Westbrook got sent out for John Wall who people are talking about buying out and a lottery protected 1st"
"They had a chance to break that streak against us, and were even up by 15 and John Wall singlehandedly won us the game"
This all makes me think of that Rusty Buckets MyGM series where he trades KP for John Wall
"They kind of don’t have a choice, someone needs to and they don’t want John Wall to play."
Reminded me of John wall tearing his achilles when he slipped in his home
Oh ofc I don’t want John Wall lol. I’m just saying Klay doesn’t have a lot of trade value rn.
John Wall needs to be rewarded for that
Makes me miss young John Wall
"This makes me miss John Wall, fuck injuries man"
"we'd rather sit Klay for the reminder of his career than get John Wall. You caught yourselp up by saying we keep him, cause we are going to do so."
"Rn he is near salary dump level and has a top 5 worst contract. Maybe John Wall and a little something but it’s too risky for trade for a player who hasn’t played for so long and on that contract. Because of that it’s better for the Warriors to keep him since he should be a great player, other GMs just can’t bank on that though."
he reminds me of john wall and russ put together
DO THE JOHN WALL
"Monta Ellis, John Wall, Nick Young and Vince are guys who’ve done it before Ja.  A young Monta in todays league would be sooooo nasty."
John Wall is the only other player I've seen do this
Challening prime John Wall there
I gotta hand it to the wizards; they turned John wall plus something like one first and two seconds into a bunch of quality players who look great next to Beal. Amazingly well done by their front office.
"Westbrook makes something like $12mil more than Simmons so of course you can’t make that trade straight up without including other assets.   I guess I don’t really agree with your point which seems to be that Simmons is a negative asset like John wall. Teams will absolutely give up a quality package to get him, Morey is just asking for too much."
"ehh there's a difference.  A lot of guys have acute injuries that are serious and miss big periods of time.  AD you never know if he's going to play because he routinely misses 15-20 games a season.  Guys like Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and even John Wall were playing just about every game when they didn't have serious injuries they were rehabbing.  That's the difference and that's why AD gets clowned."
"when john wall got injured, beal had growing pains adjusting to new role. when westbrook joined, again growing pains. dude's a top tier scorer, he'll make it work. if his past stats fit your fantasy team, this is a buy low situation"
"Derrick Rose and John Wall are/were big on candy too, IIRC. I seem to remember Rose having a Skittles machine in his house."
I know you're a Knicks fan but seriously? John Wall isn't playing better than our bench.
"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/ny-kelvin-benjamin-cut-training-camp-20210728-qvryndmzqjacjmlbrle52swcly-story.html?outputType=amp  But he was still fat and out of shape in 2021...trying to make a NFL roster.   I totally understand how losing a loved one can affect ones mentality. From KAT, IT, John Wall, Dwight Howard etc... But they were professional about it. Kelvin Benjamin blamed Cam Newton for being a shit QB not being accurate thrower... Ends up being washed up... Not many fans sympathize with his behavior"
But even cp3 was stupid athletic in his prime lol. Constantly the fastest guy on the court unless John wall or drose was playing on the other team.   Cade has more of a Rudy gay type athleticism (at least right now from what I’ve seen his first two games) but none of the height lol. If he ends up being a superstar he’s going to be the most cerebral player in the game.
&gt; currently sitting John Wall  Fuck I forgot about that. Isn't it against the rules to actively try and lose NBA games ?
"Lin, IT, cousins, Lance, ???John Wall  Current players not in the league starting 5   (John wall is agreed not playing with the rockets but couldn't figure remember another big name forward)"
Just because I was curious  Derrick Coleman 30pts on 14/28 FG  Larry Johnson 30pts on 10/20 FG  Shaquille O'Neal 34pts on 12/24 FG  Chris Webber 30pts on 12/24 FG  Glenn Robinson 17pts on 6/18 FG  Joe Smith 18pts on 7/24 FG  Allen Iverson 45pts on 16/32 FG  Tim Duncan 24 pts on 10/16 FG  Michael Olowokandi 26pts on 10/20 FG  Elton Brand 18pts on 4/15 FG  Kenyon Martin 16pts on 7/22 FG  Kwame Brown 12pts on 4/7 FG  Yao Ming 2pts on 1/6 FG  Lebron 46pts on 20/37 FG  Dwight Howard 17pts on 6/13 FG  Andrew Bogut 23pts on 10/22 FG  Primo Pasta 6pts on 3/8 FG  Greg Oden 3pts on 1/7 FG  Derrick Rose 29pts on 9/23 FG  Blake Griffin 34pts on 14/28  John Wall 42pts on 15/36 FG  Kyrie Irving 20pts on 7/19 FG  Anthony Davis 29pts on 10/18 FG
Mavs should trade for John wall. Just for kicks and chaos
Um don't you have John Wall?
John Wall lol
"I mean they are a rebuilding team that is currently sitting John Wall, and hopes to get a high lottery pick. Their guys battled tonight. Not sure you should feel for them"
John Wall looks like such a goof dressed in that sweat suit
John Wall gamewinner coming up 😈😈😈
Why is John Wall not playing again? What's the injury this time?
but what bad contract makes more sense for them than KP?  Not Kevin Love or John Wall.
John Wall will probably sign with the Heat once he gets bought out too.
John Wall expires after next year  Porzingis is the better player
We flipped 1 legged John Wall for 3 starters/finishers in 1 year and now we have depth. Can't remember opening the season with a winning record after 7 games in a while. Can't complain.
Trade for John Wall
Rockets? John Wall
"Your team's problem is you will have to pay kevin porter and Jalen green one day. Both of them do the same thing. Jaylen brown is a capable defender though. You would still have cap space to sign a max contract for 2 more years. Now you got a core of Jalen green, Brown and Christian wood plus a  max level player.   The Celtics now got cap space again to do Celtic rental like signings they love to do since John wall contract finishes."
"I think they messed up is by  having so many high level guards and then letting them walk out for free while Tatum and brown were on their rookie contracts.   They're in no man's land. Your cap is maxed and your players are great but they aren't named durant, or giannas. Should just trade brown for everything the rockets have. Take John wall, Kenyon Martin Jr and Kevin porter u just got a 1 2 and 4 postion for jaylen brown."
John Wall has started every game he's played for Houston.
"imo the Clippers should trade for Kevin Love. They have the money to get him via a couple different combinations (Morris + Kennard, Morris + Ibaka, Ibaka + Kennard, etc.), he was good under Lue, and he's still very useful offensively as someone who's above average at almost every aspect of offense (sans creation). His weaknesses (self-creation, defense) are also covered up by the Clippers's strengths.   I think others would say John Wall, but he costs like 10 million more and there's actually no evidence he's better than (or even equal to) Bledsoe, so I don't see a point in doing that."
they’re waiting to trade for John Wall
Celtics need John wall huh cmon
Dame is shooting 35% from the field and in the 20’s from 3.    He’s legitimately playing like washed John Wall.
"You could say this about so many NBA players, like John Wall for example. Dude was crazy explosive in college, no one could keep up with him. Pre-injury he was explosive as a pro too but not like in college."
Worse than John Wall? Simmons? MPJ? Deng who's still being paid by the Lakers? We can agree to disagree.
"Lmao what? KP is mostly questionable because of his health, but he's nowhere near negative value. At the start of the season there some talk about going after Simmons, which would help the secondary ball handler/playmaker problem, but we still wouldn't have someone that can create their own shot. In a perfect world, we get Bradley Beal. Otherwise, John Wall doesn't do shit for us, due to the fact that he's a shell of his former self."
"John Wall sends it to Game 7, at home, against the Celtics. Don’t remember what happened after though, but we might have been KO’d."
Do people that got amniestied count?   Did John Wall come off the bench in Houston?
"Looking at that contract now, it's honestly not that bad. 16 million a year isn't ideal, but they got off that deal pretty easy and it's not nearly as crippling as John Wall/Chris Davis' contracts."
We aren’t moving John Wall. His contract is much worse than Eric Gordons.   Eric Gordon is also prolly a better player too
"not even close lmao. John Wall, Mozgov, Westbrook"
y’all might move John Wall but Gordon will be tough
"Bro, he has negative value. I don’t think you could trade him fro John Wall, and that’s a deal I 100% make if I’m the Mavs. You guys are better with Clever at the 5."
Easily John wall jumping on the scorers table after clutching up in game 6 vs the Isaiah Thomas Celtics
John Wall 3 pt buzzer beater to even the series against the Celtics.
Never heard of John Wall and his supermax apparently.
"Al is third on the team in net rating and is generally the only thing keeping our defense from giving up 150 a night the way we've started.  I don't really see how the point about Tatum at the 4 is relevant since Brad is not the one starting the double big lineup.  Tatum could easily be playing most of his minutes at PF right now and still allowing Al and Rob to both play 24-28mpg, it's an Ime rotation issue rather than anything wrong with Al.  I'm not sure how you think we could have gotten more for Kemba when the dude had to get bought out by OKC and then signed for pennies on the dollar with New York.  He was arguably the second worst contract in the league behind John Wall, it's a minor miracle we were able to bring back Al, if anything."
I honestly think it'd be better for team if they just sent him home like what was done for John Wall and Al Horford.  Dude's got a ring and now he just wants the bag he signed for. If he doesn't want a buyout then let him stay away from the team to prevent any issues from occurring.
John Wall is right there
Gortat was right about John Wall!
Time to activate John Wall?
Yes they were bruh Christian wood and John Wall only played 81 combined games and the rest of the roster was dogshit except Kelly Olynyk who played like Larry bird for like 20 games
John-Wall-io!
"forgive me for being presumptuous, but there's no way anyone is going to give him more money over the next 3 years than $53M (47 plus two minimums).  post injury John Wall isn't Chris Paul."
John a Wall isn’t signed
That’s john a wall
"Fuck a John Wall man, he does nothing to help the future of that team"
Jalen Green has the potential to be a future MVP   i don't think he needs to be tainted by John Wall
&gt; I’m not understanding the point in sitting John Wall. KPJ looks atrocious. He isn’t a PG just because he had one 50/10 game.  So a couple things:  1.) They are pretty clearly tanking again. Lol.  2.) Wall wasn't some great PG when he played for Houston either.  Like yeah he was a better facilitator than KPJ but that also doesn't say much.  Wall's shot selection last year was flat out terrible and he isolated way too much.
john a wall
To be fair John Wall really didn't like much more of a PG than KPJ currently does when Wall was playing.  It was a ton of iso and bad shot selection from Wall basically all last year.
“Why doesn’t John Wall get any run”   You really couldn’t use context clues…..
John Wall always looking fly as fuck for a geriatric with paper skin and glass bones
Don’t forget Zach Collins and John Wall
"He is untradeable I think, can't even trade him for John Wall because Wall has 1 year less on his contract, maybe they can trade him to the thunder and attach all their picks, awful all around"
No dude its because John Wall is the worst contract in the league. The fact that Tommy Sheppard flipped him into a year of Westbrook and now these three players is one of the biggest hustles this century.
We absolutely won. You think the Lakers give us all these pieces for John Wall?
Back in like 2013 carrying was a point of emphasis for the refs. Dudes like John Wall and Brandon Jennings were getting called for multiple carries a game at the start of the season. But by the end of the year nobody was getting called for it anymore
Learned it from John Wall
not his fault john wall had two season ending injuries in a row
For what? Running john wall out of town?
What's the incentive for John Wall to do that?
John Wall?
john wall?
john wall treatment.
John Wall has an iconic shot?
"MJ did it with his iconic shot, John Wall too, and a lot more others. its valid"
"for years is a stretch.   maybe last year (even then he was a good upgrade on the corpse of John Wall).  year before that, he was a positive-neutral at worst for Rockets.   2017-2019 he was the best/2nd best player on a playoff team.   yeah, he struggled in the Playoffs, but he's been a positive player in the regular season."
Wiz turning John Wall into Westbrook into Kuzmantrezl-Pope is on the same level as the one red paper clip trade
Ball hard like John Wall in the beginning
The fact they got out of the John Wall contract in the first place is insane. Made the playoffs with Westbrook then traded him for actual value. Good shit wiz
It's more impressive if you start with the John Wall piece of this.   At least Russ has duped three teams in three years. Nobody wants John Wall anymore.
Getting down voted on this is stupid. John Wall won life. Basketball is secondary.
I miss John wall so much
Also known as John Wall
It's crazy how John Wall and Arenas finessed the NBA. Getting paid $90 mil to sit at home LMAO
John Wall: oh noooooooo….anyway….
"Wow, that’s certainly a take.  The team finally looks good, having miraculously gotten out of the albatross contract for an injured John Wall, and NOW you want to blow it up?    Bro we’re #1 in the East just enjoy it for now."
That sentiment is basically what JVG was saying about John Wall when the Rockets were playing without him yesterday.
John wall is a top 10 passer of all time
Is John Wall going to even play for the Rockets this year?
Wonder what John Wall is up to?
"We didn’t want John wall to play though, it’s not cause wall is holding out"
I forgot John Wall existed. What’s his problem?
"See some people like the Boogie comparison but I don’t believe OBJ is all the way washed up &amp; outta the league like he is yet. OBJ has received a lot of interest from playoff teams while Boogie can’t even get a phone call right now.   I’d say OBJ is more like John Wall, injuries slowed him down but he can still be productive at times. Not to mention Baker isn’t the best QB for his play style."
John wall
"He really hasn't. He was never a guy to blow by defenders like DeAron Fox or John Wall. He always relied more on his change of pace, especially when he moves off ball. Hey maybe im wrong, I'm sure there's some actual metrics out there that measure player speed"
I'd rather have Wiggins than:  John Wall  Russell Westbrook  Tobias Harris  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday  Kristaps Porzingis  D'Angelo Russell  Gordon Hayward  List goes on
John Wall still could have been a really good player and shouldn't have been traded.   Looking at it now that was a good trade
Have y'all literally forgotten that John Wall exists??!?!?
"A year prior, the Wizards got Westbrook for a single pick and the corpse of John Wall. Then they traded him to LA for a number of positive players. They definitely got a lot of profit there. If the 2019 Wizards managed a trade of KCP, Kuzma, and Harrell for Wall, a first, and 3 seconds, it would be seen as a massive steal."
"I love me some Gang Sign John Wall, but MVP Rose was a menace."
Who are these people? John wall at his best couldn’t keep up with Rose.
John Wall has a song titled after him too tho
I'm the biggest John Wall stan and I'll still take 2011 D Rose without thinking twice
Does Lil Pump have a song named after John wall ? That should answer this.
"You talking on the court or off?   Terry Rozier is a Blood. He got a couple tattoos to show.  I’ve heard Brad Beal is a silent tough guy.  Everybody knows Z-Bo  Demar Derozen (from Compton) has *literally* thrown up gang signs after making a play, and once tweeted something like “I wore blue everyday in high school”   John Wall has also thrown up gang signs"
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Ginóbili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

Give me Derek Fisher. Give me John Wall with no ACL. Give me Klay with no Achilles. Give me Kyrie with no vaccine.
So is demar derozan and John wall
"John wall throwing up gang/gun signs mid-game for one. And idk about Rozier, he just kinda gives me that vibe."
I've heard rumours of Terry Rozier and John Wall
John Wall comes to mind
"This is why I always encourage big NBA fans to, at least once in their lives, watch an NBA game as close to the court as you can. Save for it like it's a 4 hour long vacation, save $400/ticket or $1000/ticket (depending on the teams/game), get there a couple hours early and watch both teams' players warm-up, perhaps navigate the lower level and get within a few feet of some of the players, and then get good seats where you can literally hear the players communicate during the game. It really gives you an appreciation for the insane skill and freakish athleticism these players have. And an NBA game honestly feels almost like a hockey game, where possessions can change super quick (provided there aren't foul calls, timeouts, or out of bounds for a minute or two at a time). The game is played so fucking fast, and then when there's some crazy athletic play like an alley-oop or up and under lay-up or some shit, it will blow your mind.  I've had the pleasure to watch two Warriors games within the first 12 rows, and remember one game where the Warriors played the Wizards, and like two minutes into the game, it looked like Steph had an open transition lay-up, and John Wall came out of nowhere and blocked the shit out of the lay-up. Right there, I was like, ""There is no parallel universe in all the multi-verse where I'm an NBA player, no chance."""
"Lmao this comment is so stupid and ignorantly written it’s hilarious… tilman ruined the team and caused literally everyone to leave, morey, dantoni, the CEO, literally the whole team left. Why would we fault harden for wanting to win somewhere else when it was clear what was happening here?  I know you’re a warriors fan and you love this whole harden hate thing, but why not at least try to objective and not just blabber a bunch of memey bullshit. He was literally playing with John wall lol, the team was done at that point.   Notice how it’s only fans of other teams trying to shove the harden narrative down our throats when most houston fans love harden and had huge turnouts to his charity events a month or two ago. Real life isn’t this weird reddit bubble where just because you hate harden all of houston should too"
"I know a Lakers fan that hates this dude so much, every time he plays bad,  he’ll host a Twitter Space to go on him talking about how bad he is.   [“Give me Derek Fisher. Give me John Wall with no ACL. Give me Klay with no Achillies, give me Kyrie with no vaccine! This [expletive] is trash bro. This [expletive] is trash! This [expeletive] is a bonafide scrub! He can’t play. He got too much energy. He can’t lay the ball up well. He got bad fingers! He don’t shoot the ball good! This [expletive] has the worst IQ ever! You came in the league with no fucking IQ, its 10 years later…YOU AINT GO NO FUCKING IQ! This (expletive) is a fucking bonafide scrub bro….this (expletive) is the NEW KWAME BROWN bro..”](https://twitter.com/DariusTCF/status/1456647813853597697)"
"&gt; Worst supermax player in history.  Dude, there's been like, 7 lol.  And John Wall is one of them."
John Wall
They could trade him for John Wall
This series was fun to watch as someone who loved John Wall
Can’t remember the last time john wall played. Obviously Westbrick
Honestly John Wall Would Accept The Lesser Role nd Is a better Decision Maker. That’s all Yu need when Yu got AD n Lebron. Russ tryna Do Too Much.
No matter how much I question the Westbrook trade there is no world where I think for a second Lakers would be better with John Wall right now.
"john wall, rose bar legend"
Can John Wall walk right now?
"For the Lakers, Wall might honestly be better. He will shoot the 3 better than Russ, although not great (32% last year, i feel like it could be 35 with the looks Russ gets), and will definitely defend better. John Wall did have a few good moments last year."
"The only answer here is Westbrook. Even when John Wall is playing, Westbrook is the better player."
Westbrook is a much better player than John Wall  BUT Wall would make a contending team better. Don’t know if that makes sense
Always been a John Wall fan but dang I haven’t seen him play in ever
"Everyone is mentioning the injury reason, which is true, but I think an additional one is that his trade value will get lower if teams see his game right now. The idea of John Wall on your team is a lot better than the actual product you will get, especially at that salary."
Here me out… John wall for russel Westbrook? Do the Lakers say no?
"I know nobody watched John Wall last year but he's still the same guy. Deceleration, passing, handles and quickness, it's all there. He just doesn't have all time level speed he had at washington but he's still extremely fast."
"John Wall could win them a couple games that they want to lose, derailing the tank.  He could also get injured.  The truth is they will be buying him out because nobody wants to take on his contract."
why are people pretending John Wall is good?
"Ben’s trade value is effectively zero. An “all-star” who can’t shoot, quit on his team, and has a max contract - who wants that? Maybe a bad team looking to shed an even worse contract (eg, Houston/John Wall). Or a team that’s supposed to be a contender but is mediocre, willing to throw the dice…say, the Celtics? I guess the issue is, do Brown and Tatum hate each other, like Ben &amp; Embid do? I’d consider it if the 6ers added Thybule  etc and picks."
Have you not watched John wall play basketball at any point in the last 3-4 years?
"Not very relevant to the discussion. John Wall hasn’t been a max level player for a minute. If he was worth that contract, he wouldn’t be sitting at home waiting for the Rockets to buy him out. If there was a taker for that contract, I imagine the Rockets would let him go for the bare minimum, like a protected 2nd rounder or something."
I’m confused if you are arguing with me or against me lol. I think the NBA can’t really step in and force a team to use certain players on their roster. I just think like who gets to judge what’s best for a team- the team or the league? And if so what’s to say it has to stop at John wall? Wouldn’t this allow the league to force Udonis Haslem to play more in Miami? Or what about minutes per game? Hey luka you need to play at Least 39 minutes a night. See it doesn’t work. Nba shouldn’t be able to make a team use players certain ways.
"Multiple reasons, Rockets want to develop their young talent and find a trade for Wall. Wall doesn't want to get injured playing for a non-contending team that's looking to trade him. Rockets don't want him to get injured because it lowers or eliminates his trade value. Benching him is the safe play for everyone involved. I'm sure John would rather be playing basketball."
"To be fair, John wall ain’t really a max level player anymore. He’s an average to slightly above average player on a max player contract."
he’s so cheap he wouldn’t even keep that 2017-18 core. let our key role players walk for nothing lmao. hell never buy out john wall
He was an assistant in the NBA for like a decade and John Wall credited him for example for his development into a player. He didn't translate into a good HC for various reasons but the man is still qualified to talk sports science and bball.
John Wall in 2017 was a level above those guys. 23/11 in the regular season and then 27/10 in the playoffs.
"Jrue is a good one. He dealt with a lot of injuries there for awhile in NOLA, but when he was healthy he probably deserved to be more in the convo than he was.   I think Mike Conley probably gets one much earlier if he were in the East instead of the West. He's probably in the same group as Kemba, IT, and John Wall in 16-17 when he averaged 20 points a game."
"yeah but all those seasons, Beal wasn't the leader. In 13-14, 14-15, 16-17, and 17-18, John Wall was unquestionably the best player and team leader for the Wiz.  Imo, it became ""Beal's Team"" in 18-19 and has continued like that."
"John wall to Lakers, Westbrook to Philadelphia, Simmons to nets, kyrie to rockets and retire to free up cap"
They said John wall is untradeable
John Wall was legit. Stop spewing nonsense
I like John Wall but his contract is atrocious and he’s washed
John Wall actually makes more than him
"  Empty stats leading to a fluke All NBA, injury prone, and the max to a guy that doesn't make his teammates better.   He is currently the 3rd highest paid player in the league. Even if he didn't get injured.... he's paid more than:  Giannis, KD, LeBron, Anthony Davis, Dame, Klay, Jokic, Embiid, Jimmy Butler.  I'm not gonna dig up the salaries at the time of signing.  Timeline of John Wall injuries as a Wizard.  https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/timeline-john-walls-injury-history-washington-wizards  He was lucky to have missed so few games.  *I also do not want my max player to throw gang signs during multiple games on national TV no less, and pictures/videos of him surrounded by Blood gang members and drugs flowing free at a party....*   It sounds like some kinda stupid joke I'm making right? But seriously he's done that kinda stuff multiple times."
istg John Wall is team chemistry poison
"OPJ spend years on the John Wall Wizards, and did not at any moment appear to be having a good time"
"Otto ""Fuck John Wall And The Team He Rode In On"" Porter"
Except John Wall had a severe injury….
Got paid. Got fat.  John Wall 2.0
"Playoff John Wall is one of the most fun performers in recent history, and I'll die on that hill  Edit: who would've guessed back in the Schroder/Wall playoff beef that both of them would be washed now"
TBF John Wall got injured many times how many actual years could they have to actually build around him in his prime?
John wall wouldnt be fair in the same context tho. At least he tries when there is an opportunity.
Very serious question: where is John Wall playing now? Is he even playing?
"Magic said it when they lost in the finals to the us in 2012. Now 9 years later he’s still making the exact same boneheaded mistakes. It’s honestly pretty crazy how little Westbrooks iq has grown. With his explosiveness he should’ve studied Dwade. Dwade was a super explosive guy too but knew how to control it and when to use it, he wasn’t just going 100 mph every single play. Even John Wall spoke about learning how to slow down some times. Russ has no clue how to ever slow down and just play more strategically. He only knows how to play one way and that’s as fast as possible every single possession. It will never be a winning play style and I hate how now this take is probably popular but last year it would be downvoted because Russ was “the most misunderstood player” so people felt the need to defend him at every turn. He’s never played winning basketball and at this point he most likely never will."
"yeah, I'd rather trade for John wall than kp"
"Because they can’t trade Westbrook for anyone except someone like John Wall. His value is very low, Lakers have no picks, and a team trading for Russ needs to match 44m in salary"
"And my question is, who’s getting bought out this year? If John wall, the rockets would either have to eat $47m, or wall gives back a ton, and I don’t think that’s likely, this is his last big contract. Maybe Kevin love, but he’s not very good anymore.  Like, I think people overestimate the importance of the buyout market. LMA and Blake didn’t get it done for the nets, Blake was serviceable. The Lakers are not going to find a decent 3&amp;D wing on the buyout market because those guys are valuable.   And the severely hampered any trade potential because it’s much easier to package Kuzma and Harrell (and Kuzma is decent/youngish) than to try and trade Westbrook.   And honestly, for what the Lakers need I do not understand how you wouldn’t rather KCP, Kuzma and Caruso.  Honestly, if Lebron and AD are healthy, am I crazy for thinking I’d rather have role player Caruso than high usage Westbrook at this point?"
John Wall.
Eric Gordon or John Wall are the only possibility. Brodie back to HOU. And if it's Gordon it'll take sweeteners because HOU would have to send additional salary back.
John wall
"I have now found my purpose in life. Get Kyrie and Ben Simmons to the ASG.  Maybe John Wall, too"
Yeah but Russ despite all his shortcomings is still a much better player than current John Wall. Even initially they won the trade.
"It was more to mitigate the risk of John Wall. Had Wall come back and been butt, they would’ve been 100% stuck with the contract. Westbrook in the form they received him was way more tradable than Wall. The Wiz got clowned by some people at the time but it was smart trading by them to lower the risk of getting pinned down with that contract"
"Until this offseason Westbrook has only been swapped with other pg's who were seen as being on terrible contracts.   CP3 has rehabbed his value but after his last year in Houston he was seen as completely washed and possibly the worst contract in the NBA.   Next season he was swapped with John Wall, another contender for worst contract in the league. He was on a supermax and hadn't played an nba game in, what, 2 years?   The Lakers were the first team to give up anything other then guys that were seen as washed on mammoth contracts for Russ."
"Imagine not taking luxury tax while trying to do ring runs with LeBron fucking James.  That's your first mistake.  The Heat would go into luxury for Jimmy if it meant a great piece could stay, and we will for John Wall just to get him on the bench while he's overpaid."
The best thing the current FO did was flipping the injured shell of John Wall (😔) for Westbrook and then flipping Westbrook the year after for solid role players
&gt;I rather have John Wall.  That's a statement I didn't think I'd see nowadays yet so true
"You guys can probably get Kevin Love or John Wall, but then why would houston want Russ back."
One of my favorite stats from last season was how he leads the league in technical fouls last season but played a thousand less minutes theyn most of the other players in the top 10  Honorable mention to John wall though who had 11 techs in only 40 games and only ~1300 minutes though
Lol John Wall was hot garbage on the Rockets last season.
What about Westbrook for John Wall?
I have to admit I jumped for joy while laughing when the Lakers traded for Brick.  How was this not the most foreseeable thing ever? He is not a good player yet is paid 40M a year. His contract is by a wide margin the worst in the league. I rather have John Wall.
"I'd actually like to see John Wall on this Lakers team, but not even sure how a trade would work for him, because Houston needs to get him off the books."
Only player you can really trade Westbrook for is John wall … again
trade westbrick for john wall and jaesean tate
Trade Brick for John Wall. Rockets y’all owe us
"Herro is not a PG, he’s forced into it. He’s better as a scorer aka Clarkson. We need John wall, Rubio, someone like that"
Someone like John Wall?
Y’all think he’s more complete of a player than John Wall at his age?
"Honestly, atleast 60-70% of the ""big contracts"" they have gotten for their big time players, you and me could get those players.   Just look at John Wall, you think it's because of Rich Paul and Klutch he got a supermax? Or do you think you and me couldve walked into the Wizards front office and get one for him?"
"A brief explanation -   John Wall team failed  2012-we won  2015 team - Went 38-1 record, Harrison twin dribbled it off his leg in crunch time. /r/nba notoriously has bad college bball takes imo, they will badly argue that Devin Booker/Tyler Ulis should have been playing instead but forget that Harrison twins had one of the all time miracle runs in the 2014 NCAA tournament to take Kentucky to the finals. Devin Booker also could not guard a lamp post in college, so the Harrison twins were the correct decision, it's just really hard to go 40-0 at Kentucky.   2017 - Fox/Monk/Bam team had their hopes dashed by John Higgins referee making calls like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j5d4ixo\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j5d4ixo_k) throughout the game. Even though the biased referee tried to make us lose, the game still came down to one shot which North Carolina made. Had they missed that shot I believe we would have won a championship.   Immanuel Quickey/Tyrese Maxey year - This team was hitting their strides at the end of the year and I was convinced we would get to at least a Final Four and then Covid happened and the tournament was cancelled. Convince me this team didn't have a good shot when these two are so good. Quickley had the outside shooting, both of them could score floaters at will, and Maxey lives for the big time moments. Too bad we didn't get to see them shine together."
Which ever team that is proactively tanking *cough* Rockets *cough*. Free John Wall!
John Wall and Eric Bledsoe started a movement.   You can also credit Derrick Rose at Memphis
John Wall got a supermax and he's never been a top 10 player (maybe fringe at best)
Does Russell have beef with John Wall since one is a Crip and the other is a Blood?
Gonna check out of this conversation if you legit believe this sub overvalues Ben. He’s been a consistent regular season all star and been way better than anyone in Sacramento or Minnesota bar Fox or KAT.  Coaches ranked him as the best defender in the league over Gobert this past summer. /r/nba thinks the best deal we can get is for John Wall and we should be grateful for it lol. We’ll see what he ends up going for
"John Wall and the Wiz go together hand in hand.  He played with absolute Wizardry, some of those fast break acrobatic layups were baffling."
"You know what I just realised, why the fuck isn't John Wall playing for the Rockets right now. They're a young team in rebuild mode and having a veteran guard on the floor to help develop young talent can only do good things for the team right?  And another question, if he's perfectly healthy but just doesn't wanna play then why isn't he getting fined by the NBA?  I mean, he's getting ~$40 million this year, surely for that money he can do a couple of laps around the court"
"🤣🤣🤣🤣  What?!?  Dude if John Wall was upset with the current agreement he is free to say something. The team and player are both in lockstep that paying him a max contract to sit at home and chill works for both parties. They get to tank to the fullest and also play their young guys max minutes, he gets paid until a deal can be made and he doesn't have to waste what's left of his body on a bottom feeder like Houston.   Completely different scenarios."
"Lol Rox are sitting John Wall with no plans to play him and won’t buy him out and don’t seem to be moving to trade him. But it’s only okay when a team does it, not a player?  Did y’all have an issue when the Pels were sitting AD during trade talks even though he insisted on paying? I get it’s your team, but you gotta have a more neutral look at the situation."
"I'm genuinely baffled this conversation is still going.   Wood isn't an All Star or even close to it. He can put up 16 and 11, he's still a mid tier player who is not gonna draw crowds. I can guarantee you, people don't consider the chance to watch Christian Wood put up numbers in another L as entertainment. He's not gonna move the needle whatsoever to basketball fans. Hell if anything I know a few of my friends would've paid to go watch John Wall even though he's trash now.   Most fans still going to watch Rockets games are probably there to watch the opposing team at this point."
John Wall to the Clippers confirmed
"&gt; some of you guys treat him like he's John Wall.   John Wall has actually performed.  Ben Simmons isn't a good player. He's a good one-on-one defender, he's good running in transition, and he's a liability in the half-court.  He's always been evaluated on what he *could hypothetically* be, and not what he *actually is*.  And now that's fallen apart.  Simmons is a max contract player who has not lived up to expectations.  He's a worse Timberwolves Wiggins.  But Wiggins at least played. The Warriors could look at him like ""well worst case scenario this guy will be reliable to soak up minutes when we have injury issues or whatever and D'Lo is a really bad fit here"".  TWolves paid a first round pick to offload that contract for D'Angelo Russell and at the time everyone thought they won the trade."
"voiding simmons contract fucks philly, why do ppl keep suggesting it lmao  philly is over the cap (like most contenders). if they lose simmons they are still over the cap and can't sign anyone at all.   literally trading simmons for like, john wall, is better bc at worst they could bench him and be in the same position as right now or play him and hop ehe balls out. but if they lose simmons it's just over for philly having a real chance to upgrade their roster"
"&gt;The problem is teams like to win in the playoffs and trading for a guy who pretty spectacularly flamed out in the playoffs is risky. No one wants to trade their best player for a guy who can't play in the playoffs or refuses to shoot and can't hit FTs  IMO not a huge factor for Minnesota and Sacramento who have a collective 1 playoff series between them in 20 years, and who also aren't close to contending in a first round in the west either with their current core or with Ben as part of their core.   &gt;Eventually his value will get low enough that the risk is worth it, but that is what is holding up the deal. Teams don't want that risk so they are waiting for Morey to realize holding on to a player for 4 years who doesn't play is not a good plan.  Again, what low point are you talking about? You have to match saleries...there is still clearly *some* interest around the league in trading for Ben given his basketball talent. I also watched him flame out in the playoffs, but I can hold two ideas at the same time like most GM's. When you do genuinely think our BEST offer will only be for John Wall or another salary dump? That's what doesn't make sense, it's easy to say ""his value will keep dropping"" but I sure as hell don't know what's lower than Buddy Heild and Marvin Bagley. That's what most people don't seem to understand.  It's never been about Ben being viewed more positively, it's always been about other teams circumstances changing between Dec. 15th and the trade deadline, which we're still pretty far away from. That is such a better strategy to me as a fan than taking anything we were realistically offered a week after Ben collapsed publicly in the payoffs  &gt;In the meantime, as a Blazers fan, most of the fanbase is now of the opinion we shouldn't trade CJ for Simmons straight up. Let him be your problem and we will keep our 20-4-4 player who can hit FTs and makes shots and actually plays basketball.  Yeah, that's always been the case. Neil Oshey from the jump would've asked us to send picks or players your way and Morey would've asked the opposite. For many reasons that trade hasn't happened and it's not just because Morey is an idiot who doesn't know how to value a basketball player"
John Wall gonna have to sit this one out
"Yeah, and he is doing the right thing because Buddy Heild has been available and on the market for like 3 years now. It's relatively little value in return for someone who is still a really good basketball player. If we end up taking those deals then fine, but I'm more than happy to wait things out and see what happens vs trading him literal weeks after our collapse against the Hawks.  Nobody's value is high coming off that playoff performance. It's insane to me that people think his value didn't bottom out. Unless you believe somewhere down the line the BEST offer is a John Wall salary dump, we're still going to get something in return for Ben.   GM's are smart, they can weigh everything in front of them and realize Ben would change their team in a positive way almost immediately, that's why someone will eventually trade for him. There is baggage in the way obviously, but trading an asset right at the lowest point in their entire career is so stupid. When the opportunity cost of waiting, is Buddy Heild and Marvin Bagley? Seems moronic to take that deal"
"I am one of those weirdos who will always love John wall, and I’d like him ob this clipper team(As tjarks suggests) but I don’t think that any move that takes away depth is any good. One of our biggest strengths is having a lot of varied, good rotations."
"I mean someone traded for John Wall while not being held at gunpoint, anything is possible."
Fine. John Wall
Rich Paul has lost all leverage. Sixers won't move him at a discount and there are fewer interested teams.  His quote comparing the John Wall/Rockets situation is a dumb joke played on the media. The basis for all employment contracts is services for money. Houston is holding up their end of the contract by paying him $44M.   Somehow Klutch has used this as precedence for a player not holding up his end of the contract by still expecting the other party to hold up his? Total clown show.
John wall is going to get bought out
"He didn't play defense at LSU and still went #1 lol. The dude is v good at basketball and one of the best defenders in the league.  Unless you think we're going to attach picks to him, and get a salary dump in return, I dont' see where his value goes lower. You still have to match salaries and we were offered the Buddy Heild + Marvin Bagley package over the summer. We were offered Malik Beasley + McDaniels from Minnesota.  If you believe his value can go lower you're basically saying you think we're not even going to get even a positive asset in return. GM's aren't that swayed by off the court drama. You think if this drags on, and we called every GM in the league our best offer would eventually be John Wall for Simmons + Maxey lol?"
"Also this is why it appears the Rockets, who wear red, pay John Wall not to play. It was actually a hostage negotiation with the Wizards, who wear blue. NBA rules don't allow hostage payments, so they just reported it as a standard player contract. To keep their cover, they did have Wall appear in some NBA games last season, he actually didn't make a cent off of those games, as the payments went directly to the crips of DC. The Wizards however were simply a front company, the real mastermind is behind the Washington Football Team. That is supposed to be the Washington Crips but of course NFL rules don't allow that. Daniel Snyder isn't actually a human being but a really dumb robot with poor AI subroutines that they use as a puppet face for the team.  All of this is from my careful research into the matter. I would link people to websites but the lamestream media keeps taking them down. You'll have to consult my good friend Joe Rogan about it."
Lmao [John Wall would refuse playing](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2908921-wizards-john-wall-apologizes-for-video-showing-him-flashing-gang-signs) in that arena
"He's playing it perfectly as an asset manager, not a GM of a real team of human beings.  The players and staff must be tired of having to talk about this every single week. Do the players and coaches even want Ben to come back? Because in the practices he did go to, he got kicked out. Would having him get DNPs on the bench in person vs. wherever he is be great for the team? So why keep on trying to get him to come back and not pay him?  The FO has been dragging their feet getting a deal done for the best deal which is fine, but they're also trying to get Ben out of his money. They could treat it like a Kyrie or John Wall situation and let him sit out, still get paid, and work for a deal. Instead they want it all and it's causing weekly drama."
"&gt; Other guys like John Wall have flashed gang signs in games before  Lol, flashed makes it sound timid and quick. John BANGED that shit and took a picture while on a max contract."
"The two largest gangs in the west coast IIRC US for majority African-Americans. Bloods wear red and crips wear blue. It’s a major rivalry. There are members in other areas of the country.   Also since some nba players grew up poor and sometimes in the hood near gangs when they showed potential the gangs would protect them, the biggest example is DeMar DeRozan who grew up near crips. Other guys like John Wall have flashed gang signs in games before. Terry Rozier is part of a smaller group called GMB.   The rivalry is so intense crips don’t say B so for example for birthdays they say G-Day, and if you wear rival colors to the wrong neighborhood you could be possibly seen as a member and attacked.   Crips are known for their dance the c-walk, lots of vids on YouTube. Bloods have some famous hand signs like making the word “blood” with their hands and also CK which means crip killa"
There's a difference between returning a top player and being a negative asset. A negative asset is someone like John Wall who you need to attach picks to in order to trade for anyone. Simmons is someone you would need to attach picks (and possibly more) to in order to trade for a top guy.
"He’s not John Wall, John Wall has a reason his game fell off, Simmons is just a spoiled baby"
"Lol, you think he’s worth, what is his contract, $160 million? You think anybody is going to give up a top player for a guy who choked in the playoffs then refused to come back for his team? Hell, let’s look at it in the beat possible light, he’s having psychological issues- that’s an injury that’s preventing him from playing even if its not physical. Why would a team want damaged goods at a high price tag? Ask John Wall, he knows alllll about it"
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
John wall the closest I can recall
"Listen I get that Simmons has shown zero development in his offensive game and collapsed in the playoffs, but some of you guys treat him like he's John Wall.    Simmons will make All-Star games, make All NBA teams, and make All Defense teams during the remainder of his career. Calling it now."
"John Wall is ass in comparison to Ben, Sixers don’t want him"
John wall for Simmons swap. It sounds ridiculous but it low key might work
John wall for Simmons?
I have no issue with John wall sitting. The lineups are still atrocious. Like we’re tanking and really young so why not play the rookies and let them develop. Sengun got 5 minutes earlier today. Even Danuel house got more just to put up 0/0/1 on 0-5 shooting. I try to watch every game and I’m disappointed and confused every time. Idc about losing but we’re losing without developing because our coach is barred out choosing the lineups
"I don't blame Silas.  He isn't allowed to play John Wall because they're trying to move him, so he's basically throwing a bunch of young, inexperienced players to the wolves.  He's desperately hoping one of them will turn into the messiah so that he can keep his job once the ""process"" is over.  Rockets 100% chose to blow up a championship competitive squad.  I really think a Chris Paul/Harden duo, as many problems as they had together, wins the bubble championship with the 3 and D players Morey gave them.  CP3, Gordon, Harden, Tucker, and Covington with Ariza, Gerald Green, Rivers, Nene and Shumpert off the bench is a squad that could have beaten the hobbled Lakers."
"Our fans were complaining too when guys like Kenrich and Muscala are playing like 20mins a game and Favors 15mins a game. I pointed out that even for a rebuilding team you need to play vets for stability and cited guys like Gordon etc are still playing 20-25 mins a game which isn't too bad  I think the problem is you have too many vets on your roster to begin with (Gordon, House, Theis, Agustin, and even Wood) while we have 3 at the most. That's not even including John Wall. Sure Silas isn't without blame but if you actually want to develop your young guys, I feel like cutting Agustin and House would be your best bet and play a healthy Wall in a mentorship role instead. Even Gordon can be bought out or traded for scraps at this point"
Trade him for John Wall again for the lulz
"&gt; notoriously known for being elite talents while making everyone around them worse?  &gt; John wall  &gt; James Harden  &gt; Russell Westbrook  &gt; Anthony Davis  ???  You literally picked two Assist-champions, a PG that's averaged 9 assists per game, and one of the greatest 2nd options and said they ""make everyone around them worse"""
Banish him to a rebuild like Houston for someone like John Wall and a 1st round pick and call it a fucking win and be done with it.
"Ben Simmons for John Wall, who says no?"
"Ben Simmons to Houston, John Wall to Philly and let's be done with this bullshit.  Similarly, Westbrook to the Nets and Kyrie to LA, mostly because I wanna see Russ, Harden and KD together again."
Rockets: trade for John Wall and a piece. Houston probably says no.
"The evidence would seem to suggest that nobody is untradeable (that evidence being ... Westbrook himself. And John Wall). Although it really does seem like at this point, it's hard to imagine who would take him on.   The contract is so hard to match that even if you think he's still got something in the tank, you have to give up so much for him that it's hard to see how it improves your team."
Why not trade him for John Wall?
Now have to give up a first-round pick to get John Wall.
Rockets would trade for Westbrook. Y’all take John Wall and give us a pick and a swap. We would be the perfect place for Westbrook. No expectations. He could be ball dominant. We need a point guard. Great role model in terms of work ethic. 100% tank commander.   Also the memes would be amazing if Westbrook gets traded for Wall twice.
Westbrook was traded to Houston because Morey was desperate to make a splash and destroyed any future draft flexibility to do it.  Westbrook was traded to Wizards for an injured overpaid player in John Wall - it's a miracle the Wizards got him for Wall to begin with.  Westbrook was traded to the Lakers for scraps so they could go out and make signings in the offseason.  Lakers actually need some decent players back and i just dont see any team with players that the Lakers would want / match salary to make it work
In b4 Rockets trade John Wall for Russ
"Why i made the thread, to see if anyone could come up with possible deals?  Only possible deal ive read on sports talk shows is John Wall and i think that's probably the best the Lakers can do"
&gt;Westbrook is untradable except for maybe John Wall  Did you just say Westbrook is untradable?  Where have you been last 5 years?
Lakers could have traded for Lowry  Then had enough pieces to trade for Hield  Lowry - Hield - Bron - AD - Dwight  Pelinka (despite LeBron working behind the scenes) needs to be fired  Westbrook is untradable except for maybe John Wall
Again I am asking for your interest in a lightly used John Wall  Ben Simmons is a problem I'd love to have just for the memes of it
"Gobert has the wall contract in the sense that everyone making that money has it… which isn’t a great point   Gobert is still hands down the best defensive player in the NBA and has a huge impact on the game. Even when healthy John Wall was very inefficient and it was questionable whether he deserved that contract, the injuries just turned it from a bad contract into the worst contract in NBA history"
Trade Harden for John Wall tbh  Wall averaged 20 last year so he is better than Harden tbh
"how hilarious would that be  Morey GMs Houston, leaves for Philly. Houston dangles Harden in front of Philly and then says ""nah"" sorry we ain't gonna do it   A year later Houston comes back and says ""hey we got this guy who was an All Star, his name is John Wall, and we'll throw in KPJ for the hell of it, final offer""  god as hateable is Tillman Ferttita is this is just hilarious how he's just making a fool of Morey by setting Simmons value at James Harden and then completely yanking the rug out from him."
The packages offered were better than what they'll ever get. The LeVert package was probably the best thing any one could have conceivably offered and that disappeared. Then there was Bagley and Buddy and a pick. That is gone now. Then there was the malik and bey trade.  At this point they're going to get John wall.
Trade him for John Wall
John wall and 1st from Houston would be more than fair. Houston is a dumpster fire right now. No offense to Rocket fans.
For real- John Wall and a 1st feels like a fair trade at this point. At least Wall will be off the books way sooner and can actually facilitate a little. He's a below-average starting PG and solid bench PG at this point.   Once that max is off the books the Sixers shouldn't have much trouble recruiting free agents to sign with them and play w/ Embiid for the latter-half of his prime.
Honestly they would be lucky to get John Wall. Maybe if Sixers send a first with Simmons they can get Wall.
"Gobert what? Not even comparable to Deng or Wall  John Wall is the worst contract in basketball history and Shepard turned that into a fun season where they made the playoffs and now a genuinely good team, all while keeping his star happy"
That looked like John wall
Navigated John Wall better than anyone could hope.  It took a gap year but they're free lol
"Yeah it’s a bit of an odd situation and including him feels weird since I don’t expect him to return, but I do think the Sixers would play him if he reported to the team. Basically, this isn’t the same as with John Wall and the Rockets."
"Between regular season and postseason, that’s like 30 missed games or about a third. I wouldn’t call that exactly reliable. It’s going to be the same thing this year. I guess you’re going to tell me how great John Wall and Klay Thompson are and where they should be ranked? At a certain point, you just need to allow those recovering from injury to just rehab and get back on the court. There’s no point in discussing how wonderful those guys are as they haven’t played very much recently. Yea, when they play they are good. You can’t know how good Kawhi will be after serious injury. Nobody knows how anyone will recover from such things."
"John Wall is worse than Westbrook, no thanks."
"Welp, John wall can’t play there I guess"
John Wall 2017 season. Pre injury wall was a beast man.
"Per 36 minutes, John wall had his most PPG last year with Houston"
John wall did good after injuries and it’s not like Klay is loosing his shooting ability
They should play John Wall.
They just need to make John Wall play. No one is trading for his contract unless the Rockets attach wild amounts of picks to it that will remove any meaning to the terrible season they're having. Only a grotesque buyout will get rid of him. No one would voluntarily give up the amount of money that is on his contract.
John Wall for kyrie
Lol did *you* watch him play?   Search up John wall Minnesota game from a few months ago
John Wall for Westbrook trade? IDK is there any precedent for such a thing? lol  Have two players ever been traded for each other twice?
Basically. And pray John Wall is actually better. Lol.
Rockets Westbrook had the bet month of his entire career from an efficiency standpoint.  Wizards Westbrook lead the team to the play-in with spectacular play.  John Wall isn't touching the court and cannot improve his value.
"Is John Wall really that bad now? Obviously overpaid no question but would he not benefit teams like the Clippers, celtics, and maybe knicks? saying this as someone who didn't watch him play on the rockets last year."
Yeah Westbrook. Westbrook's value keeps going down so i was saying the next worse player they could go for is basically John Wall. You're right though Rockets have no use for him unless they can get some picks from Lakers if they even have any.   Also what's Westbook going to do if he doesnt want to sit at home if he did get traded back to Rockets lol. Demand to be played or he'll be toxic? lol.
"It's definitely hypocrital, but the main reason that the league doesn't care compared to when other teams rest healthy players is because at this point no one is either tuning into, or buying tickets to, the Houston Rockets thinking ""man oh man, I can't wait to watch John Wall play"".  The NBA fined the Raptors for resting guys like Lowry and Siakam because people actually want to watch them play."
John Wall with no injuries.
John Wall at this point.
John Wall
I watched him last season. That’s not true. John Wall was the equivalent of nuclear fallout after our spite winning streak ended.
This is a bummer all around. I’d like to watch John Wall play. I hope he gets a chance
"DLo, Kemba Walker, John Wall tier"
Probably the best comp to Brick but John Wall is still the more effective player.
Some folks here have a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue.   All parties involved are fine with this scenario.  Wall gets to train and heal for another year. The Rockets get to tank. The NBA gets to promote the Rockets young stars.  There is zero acrimony. Wall is with the team. He practices and shoots around with the team. Then he goes home and rolls in his money.  His contract is untradeable till next season. Everyone understands and accepts it. Its no big deal.  The only losers are die hard John Wall fans. But...who the hell is a die hard John Wall fan?
John wall is a very similar player.
John Wall his entire career has been a pass first point guard and was an all-defense level defender for years until he was forced to carry too big of a scoring burden. He would absolutely be an asset to a contender. It’s pretty clear you’ve never really watched John Wall.
If that was the case he could negotiate a buy out. But I think the rockets are holding him in case someone else on a  supermax tanks in value then they could flip him for picks. Westbrook seemed like a candidate at the start of the season but unlikely now. John wall can get his body right in the meantime
If the Rockets want him out of there they're going to have buy him out. No one is trading for John Wall on that contract.
"You’re saying prove a claim like it’s a paper. I just google John Wall sit out rockets and found a bunch of articles, it takes two seconds."
"Why would John Wall get criticism? He played last season, still practiced with the team this season, and doesn't play because the rockets don't want him to play. If anyone should get criticism, it's the rockets."
"Yup, makes 47.3 million next year.   After next year he will have made close to 280 million in just NBA contracts at age 32. So there could be a chance he doesn’t really care about playing again considering he will be 10th all time for NBA career earnings at the end of his current contract.   Winning isn’t everything, and I’m sure John Wall doesn’t want to do extensive injury rehab and have trouble walking in his 40’s, which playing for Houston this season wouldn’t help."
"i wonder why John Wall does not want to play. If I were him, i'd be worried about rust and not staying sharp by sitting out 2 seasons. Or maybe he is more worried about injuries. So he sits for 2 years and does not play?   he has another year on his contract right?"
"Curry is challenged vertically but he’s an elite athlete in all other metrics… he’s one of the quickest guys in the league, he’s probably got the best endurance and he’s fast. Also his hand eye coordination and proprioception has to be tops in the league too.   He’s not John Wall fast or Kyrie quick but he’s up there. Now his endurance and hand eye is next level elite.   He’s not Tom Brady out there lol. Dude has some desirable athletic traits."
simmons to the rockets for john wall
"John Wall isn't going to get this type of contract again, ~80 mil before taxes is a lot to leave on the table for a chance to play."
"Oh, then I got another one for ya. The Wizards couldn't wait to get rid of John Wall. Fans loved him because he was drafted there but the organization was looking for any reason to move him. And now the Rockets are stuck with him and there's not a single front office in the league dumb enough to take him on at anything close to his current salary."
https://dc.sbnation.com/washington-wizards/2010/11/11/1808466/john-wall-dougie-colin-cowherd-rant-father
"Thanks man, I owe it all to my amazing life coach, John Wall. He has always been a beacon of light, even in the darkest of times. Is this the part where I disgrace my team by repeatedly throwing gang signs or the part where I fight my teammate's in practice?"
"It makes me old enough to know that John Wall isn't a ""coach"" for the rockets"
I mean I can definitely understand why the Kings wouldn't do it. No team wants to be on the hook for a max contract for a player who could end up being a John Wall. It is the sort of risk that makes or breaks careers.
The kind where John Wall isn't involved.
I mean I would consider this complaining: https://thespun.com/nba/houston-rockets/look-john-wall-breaks-silence-on-his-situation
"Yeah, John wall doesn't do shit, he doesn't want to be there, and the ""coach "" line is some bullshit so they don't have to say he's an uncooperative, expensive dick who they can't trade"
"This is an underrated comment, and not just because I’m a Kings fan.  People haven’t fully grasped what the playin has done to the trade deadline.  I blame the Magic for being entirely too sane last year.  You know who can make the playoffs at the deadline?  Everyone!  Except for the teams that decided to start up the tank at the beginning of the year, you know who’s going to try to make the playoffs at the deadline?  Almost everyone.  Will it be stupid?  Sure!  But because of the playin, now it is the way.  There might be one team that gets to the deadline, has been trying to make the playoffs, can still make the playoffs, and won’t try to.  But that’s not going to be true every year now.  There are not going to be multiple teams doing it.  And it’s definitely not going to be the team in the middle of a drought.  The players available at the 2021 deadline that can improve your team will be John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, and maybe a Spur."
Nobody is paying to see John wall play for the rockets. That’s how it’s different as AD was the star if the team that drew a crowd and tv audience.
"Yeah idk man, paying Chris Paul or Westbrook 40 mil is a lot different than paying John Wall 40 mil"
"But when you have the chance to be as talented as John Wall or better with an NBA career, all of this means nothing to most players. If you're an athlete, it's only about winning."
"Chris Paul and Westbrook are both still All-Star caliber players. Based on last season, John Wall is not that. He’s a solid starting point guard but realistically what team is that desperate for a point guard?   It’s not impossible to move him but it’s not like he’s a player that can raise your floor or ceiling by that much like Westbrook or CP3 which is what makes people say he has no trade value"
Because John Wall isn’t as good as Anthony Davis
becuase AD is a star and John wall sucks
"I know it seems like a dream to outsiders, but honestly it probably sucks to be John Wall right now. If you're a basketball player, your dream isn't to get court side seats. Your dream is to be playing meaningful minutes on a team competing for a championship. John Wall's turned 31 not too long ago. He probably really wishes he could be one of those guys playing great basketball at age 31."
"&gt; “He lit up our model,” said Morey. “Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft.” The objective measurement of Jeremy Lin didn’t square with what the experts saw when they watched him play; a not terribly athletic Asian kid. Morey hadn’t completely trusted his model – and so had chickened out and not drafted Lin. A year after the Houston Rockets failed to draft Jeremy Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps: Jeremy Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured. He was explosive and was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players. “He’s incredibly athletic,” said Morey. “But the reality is that every **** person, including me, thought he was unathletic. And I can’t think of any reason for it other than he was Asian.”  Also, https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jj7nzj/jeremy_lin_at_one_point_had_the_highest_average/  Lin was faster than both Derrick Rose and John Wall in average and start speed."
Are you comparing John Wall to Chris Paul lol
John wall sucks
Yeah people were paying to see Davis play then. Nobody's paying to see John wall play these days.
"John Wall=negative asset, AD=positive asset."
"Congrats on all that really, but that was before your team got sold to a  guy who managed to in what 2 years drive off your HoF franchise cornerstone, HoF coach, and the GM that was the architect of your analytics heavy approach and all your success over the past decade.  I'm glad you can look back fondly on your history because at the moment you've got the worst coach in the league, a gm whos highlights include trading for John Wall, and getting back a pile of shit for James Harden, and the worst owner in the league.   You're rebuilding from scratch with Frittata at the helm. Unless the Zion situation blows up in New Orleans I don't think there's a franchise with a bleaker outlook."
I think a better comparison is resting healthy players and fans should be able to see the stars.  Which of course is irrelevant here because nobody has cared about seeing John Wall in like 5 years
No one is buying tickets or watching TV games for John Wall.
John Wall &amp; the Rockets mutually agreed and also John Wall isn’t good
"I wonder with posts like this. Do you actually believe the point you are arguing? Or are you just trying to stir up shit? Cuz I feel like anyone who follows basketball even somewhat closely would have to know the difference between the John Wall and AD situations. So yeah, did you legit not know why it’s different before you made this post? I’m legit interested."
John Wall and the Rockets both are content with that*
Imagine how much worse they'd be if they traded for John Wall
John wall is washed
Isn't john wall fresh off an acl too and is like probably much older?
Since they traded for John Wall
"I said the same thing. So many of these guys worked their entire life to get to the NBA. What do we see on draft day? Tears, hugs, and hard work being paid off. Even NBA playoffs sign off on playing basketball after the season is over, because they just love to hoop.  John Wall did not play NBA basketball for about two years, and I figured it would humble him and make him hungrier to get back on the court. No, he's fine taking more time off. It is what it is."
What contract will a 33 year old shell of himself John wall  really get?the Wiz would probably give him  nice little deal like the panthers did for cam
"For the people who are saying the John Wall situation is mutual while the AD situation wasn't, therefore AD was forced to play, shouldn't that also apply to Kyrie as the nets are sitting him in all of their road games?"
John wall is a scrub
Nobody paying tickets or tuning in to watch John Wall
John Wall is a Klutch client also. You know they are the best agency when dumbass fans blame them instead of the players for their actions. Well worth the money from a player's perspective.
Why does the organization not want John Wall playing ?
"Can someone explain to me why John Wall isn’t playing???? If he’s able to and they’re paying him ~$40 million, why would you not play him?"
"John Wall kinda complained, that he’s getting “punished for something he can’t control”"
No one's dropping a ton of money to see John Wall play at this point in his career.
I think because it is mutual.   AD wanted to play basketball. He just let his team know he wasn't resigning with them.   John Wall seems content being the highest paid assistant coach in the history of all professional sports.
"It's much more simple: John Wall hasn't complained that they aren't letting him play, AD did."
John Wall is no longer a superstar player. If it was before all of his injuries then it could be a different story
John wall is bum
Anthony Davis wanted to play John Wall probably doesn’t
John Wall agreed to not play.  Anthony Davis was upset that his team was attempting to shut him down.  The Anthony Davis being forced to play was one of the weirdest things I have ever seen in professional sports though
Anthony Davis was a superstar in his prime at the time.  John Wall is at best an overpaid rotational player at this juncture of his career post injury.
Cuz nobody cares about John Wall lol
John wall buyout perhaps.
"I'm curious too, I figure i'd remember.  Other random Klay moment, remember when him and John Wall (maybe Beal) got into a scuffle like 7 years ago? What a random beef out of no where"
how the fuck can John Wall be content with NOT PLAYING BASKETBALL AT ALL after *finally being able to play after* ***two years.*** how can any player of his caliber (he clearly wanted to succeed when he played) be content not playing any basketball when he's healthy? i mean is it really just cuz he's filthy rich he doesn't care that much anymore?
"They should make an All NBA at home Team. Kyrie, John Wall, Ben Simmons. Work from Home nba edition."
John wall called and said those are Rookie numbers.
Play John Wall!
"Not at present, but pre-ACL DRose always showed up 110% when facing the other top PGs at that time.. CP3, DWill, Westbrook, John Wall… His stats were always higher than average vs those other guys"
"John Wall was a great player. From 2013-2018 he averaged 21/4/10/2/1 with all nba defense and 5 consecutive all star selections.  People forget how good he was cause of the injury, but he earned that contract."
Free John wall
I do think John Wall playing is at least an actual point guard who would give some structure to the team and help the young guys develop good habits compared to what's happening right now
&gt;all time great  That's the first time I've ever seen John Wall described that way. Not including his HS mix tape
"lol John Wall is the best player on that team. he will get a low contract for a contender for a year or two, ball out pretty well, then get a nice 2 yr contract from a mid level team. its the cycle"
2016-17 John wall was a top 3 pg
He'll likely get bought out or traded next season. Taking a gamble on an expiring or minimum John Wall is much easier to swallow
"No but fuck it, I’m going to go as far as to say that John Wall is _outraged_."
John Wall is Rich Paul's client right? Maybe his agent just believed sitting on the bench is the best way to get yourself traded
"John Wall could win them like 3 or 4 more games by now if he played, he just isn't going to, He is the best player on that team, and wood is apparently washed."
John Wall is the best pg on here who gets payed 44 million.
Have you watched any of our games? The coaching has definitely been a problem. It’s also not like John Wall is going to come in and turn things around. He was nicknamed “The Tank Commander” last year for a reason.
"I think the Kemba buyout + contract would have been good for everyone, get a new team to give John Wall a $5-10M contract, subsidize Houston a bit for the amount on their books..  Now no one has any cap space. I think Wall was deserving of a similar deal so I guess they just weren't able to put something together."
"Imagine weighing the future of a head coach that has inherited an absolute shit show of a roster from last year and a bunch of young rookies all in their teens this year. Also no John Wall yet either.  Rockets management is stupid as hell. Their drafting was good, but the team construction and expectations from this roster are insane."
That will be one hell of a legacy for John Wall to leave behind.
John wall?
"Gordon, Theis and Augustin may have positive trade value to win now desperate teams if they play well. John Wall is not."
there are really no inside details in this story lol. a quote from silas saying he’s been good for the locker room and mannix just saying john wall tweeted a couple things
john wall will be back playing again lmao
"That's the point, Houston decided to put John Wall down and all of a sudden the coach is a problem? They have a veteran point guard earning 42m just sitting"
Still way higher than John Wall
they have 42 mill in dead cap by choice.  they could be playing john wall or negotiate a buyout and nobody made them take on bad contracts to help them tank  I dont think its silas' fault per se but I also dont see why the rockets care about optics right now  People seem to want sengun to get more minutes but it seems to be in their best interest to shamelessly tank anyway
"Thank you for proving my point.  You want to not be the worst team ever? Play John Wall, now you have a regular bad roster. Y’all have 40 million just sitting on the bench and in his place you’re playing young guys who don’t know how to play point guard.   Congrats on being the Cavs of the past few years but with even less talent. No coach is saving that."
"?!?!?!?! They have a roster full of rookies and 1-2 year players. What do you expect? They didn't go get anyone good in FA. The biggest notable signing I remember for the Rockets was them signing David Nwaba. I like Nwaba, but c'mon. The Rockets put together a roster that should win at most 5 games the entire season. 6 if they start to play John Wall."
Just name John Wall the player/coach to justify the salary.
then they should play John Wall if they want to win more instead of firing their coach. They've been playing without a PG for like 3 straight games with KPJ out and Wall is just sitting on the bench.
"What in the world made you think the Rockets would be fighting for a play in spot? They weren't that great WITH James Harden, who went on TV and said they weren't good enough. They quit playing John Wall to play their young guys exclusively. They traded basically everyone but Eric Gordon. I don't know how you seemed to believe they would be competitive. Rebuilding takes time."
"Hell no. He's an incredible player and we would never get someone nearly as impactful as him. Plus he only has 2 years left on his contract, he's not John Wall."
Problem with Houston is the fact they just got rid of Westbrook and complained about Kennard’s deal in a John Wall trade. Don’t think they go for Westbrook
I watched John Paxon hit that three against the Suns in the 1993 finals.   I was 12 years old. I was so worked up before that moment that I actually headbutted the bathroom wall (drywall thankfully) and put a hole in it because I thought my Bulls were going to lose.   I lied a little and tried to say that I punched the wall but the guy who fixed it noticed a few strands of hair stuck in the wall lol
"His speed was never really part of his game.   It's catch and shoot, or take a few dribbles and pull up. Dudes not John Wall"
Hard to turn on AD if he doesn’t play ala John Wall. Via his vintage injuries.
laughs in john wall and kyrie irving
This is fine but you can't call him one of the best then. It's a contradiction. He's a good point guard just like someone like John Wall.
John wall going behind the back and dunking during the playoffs at the hawks game. Craziest play I've ever seen in person   https://youtu.be/wcrOfrfi63g
John Wall
I hope John Wall trips getting into his Lambo or whatever and breaks his leg in 17 places.
Does John Wall+ rockers 3rd stringers beat the rockets starters?
I only consider John Wall “updates” updates if he actually plays or gets dealt anything else is just click bait saying the same thing we knew months ago.
Wizards really got an amazing return for John Wall.
I believe KD rested about 18 months? And it seems like it was the right choice for his longevity. Even John wall rested a long time. Think people are realizing that rehab for the Achilles is long but with decent outcomes now
"I wanted to see what I could get with the 2011-12 season: 7-59 Bobcats, 20-46 Wizards, 21-45 Hornets  PG = John Wall, Jarret Jack  SG = Eric Gordon, Jordan Crawford, Gerald Henderson  SF = Trevor Ariza, Al-Farouq Aminu, Corey Maggette  PF = Rashard Lewis, Boris Diaw  C = Javale McGee, Nene, Emeka Okafor  Is that team any good? No not really."
You get John Wall back and Kevin Love is your only remaining forward.
"My shitpost about the John Wall GoFundMe got taken down, but this stays up?"
"&gt;Klay is going to return and go back to being himself, an extremely valuable piece on a contending team, they don't even deserve to be in the same discussion.  Klay hasn't even played a single game since signing that contract. Thinking he will be close to what he was before is just ridiculous, especially after 2 major injuries. He's more likely to be like John Wall than Kevin Durant. And I say this knowing Durant missed most of the last 2 seasons"
John Wall homecoming?????
Morey asking for heavens and my guy thought why not John Wall? LoL
"Trust me they would. That's why superstars get to demand trades in the first place. Not treating a superstar right really hurts your chances with other stars. It would also piss off Paul George who wants to be paired with Kawaii in the first place.  Also most of the star players who will be in free agency will be Brooklyn's core. Assuming they don't want to break up their super team you're not getting any of them... So you're left with Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle, John Wall.... I think Leonard is better when healthy than those players.  Also signing a new super star means you have to make the cap room. You can't just use your bird rights. Makes you lose a lot of talent, sometimes assets to move contracts."
"Lmao after everything Morey has asked for, he just ends up shopping Ben Simmons out for John wall. Would be hilarious"
John Wall will be the reason your team stays in the depths of purgatory lmfao..
[Yes he did](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/john-wall-bought-customized-rolex-watches-each-his-wizards-teammates)
"Young and Collins just signed huge new deals. Sometimes in pro sports when a star player gets a massive new contract, they’ll buy their teammates a gift as a sort of thank you. Hill is joking with Young and Collins that John Wall bought him a Rolex in a similar situation in the past, so the implication is that he’s expecting something from them now, as well."
i think John Wall gave everyone on the Wizards a rolex
John wall is washed fam
John Wall is just old Jalen Green dw
John Wall!
"It’s not like we’re over the cap, buying John Wall out wouldn’t do much for us at all other than not having to play him and our owner saves a few mill  His value is the lowest is possibly could be right now. Rather we play him (25 min or under per game) and hopefully he looks a bit better and we go from there"
I would never have thought Kemba would get bought out with two years and $73m owed. But if that’s possible - John wall $91m seems not too far of a stretch. Just depends on what the player gives up.
"Or maybe Kawhi is waiting to sign to pressure to Clips to trade for John Wall....  I mean, a guy can hope, right?"
"John Wall was a negative player last year on the court without even considering his contract, im not sure he makes a lot of these teams better in just pure opportunity cost"
John Wall would have to be super disgruntled to give back that much money.
"&gt;It is possible we could've rehabbed his value this season.  No that wasn't really ever going to be possible. Unless you found a way to time travel back to his prime.  &gt;This was a value-train (got value to take Horford, got value to take Kemba) and at some point the train has got to stop.  This is accurate, can only keep leveraging more and more to a certain extent..the only worse contract in the league at this point was John Wall. They could still be buyers of other bad contracts though, as long as you guys don't have to compete and you don't need the money elsewhere, I would just keep doing it. Trade for Love, trade for CP3 or Butler in like 3 years lol"
John wall would be a surprising buyout
"John Wall, Tobi Harris"
John Wall is next
John Wall pls do the same
Prime John Wall was better than Ja and Kyrie.
You’re still not picking up what I’m putting down.  John Wall at his prime was never better than LeBron or KD for that matter. Agent must be a great negotiator. Has nothing to do with his injuries.
Did i say he didnt deserve it? I like John Wall.  John Walls making more money than LEBRON!
Why folks be acting like John Wall didn't deserve his contract when he got it?
"If you're a Kings fan you probably know about him more than me, but Fox is more fast and beats his man with a quick step for most of his points which is good while young but we've seen fast players like John Wall and Derrick Rose fall apart and lose their game. Although Ja is fast as well, his game is much more balanced and in my opinion will develop and age much more gracefully with age than Fox's. Ja has two more years to catch up to Fox and he has all the ability to do that and even more"
uhhh we lost to the Wizards cause Lowry and JV couldn't guard the pick and roll and John Wall and Gortat roasted us ad nauseum. I don't think it's fair to blame that one on DD - that was by far Lowry and JV getting worked.
"John Wall/DeMar Derozan would’ve been ECF shit a few years ago  it’d still be fun as hell to watch, but damn…"
John Wall.
Will you take John Wall?
John Wall
"Sir, I will take a singular peanut for John Wall"
Clippers may I interest you in one JOHN WALL?
"I mean, if you're talking about isolating one single position, then it's way, way more rare for the best player to be the *second* pick.    KD, and maybe LaMarcus Aldridge are the only two examples in the last 20 years.    Meanwhile you've got Yao Ming, LeBron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, AD, and arguably John Wall and Zion who are #1 picks who turned out to be best in the draft."
hopefully john wall 🙏🏼
John wall was paid a super max to sit the bench
Might be John Wall no cap
2018 LeBron=2020 John Wall
John Wall
The 2021 Clippers striking out on all veteran PGs and resorting to trading for John Wall... I hope
I thought him and John Wall were gonna be the Wizards backcourt of the future but then they drafted Bradley Beal Lmaoo
"As long it’s not on video, then you can you just claim you were doing something else.  Case in point - John Wall. Anyone who thinks a pro athlete was just chilling at home and tore his Achilles is crazy."
healthy john wall was such a stud 🥲
"I don't see it. There's no one in his tier of players who has ever been paid more. Even when their team is up against the cap. Only 5 players got paid more this offseason, CP3, Lowry, Derozan, Conley, and John Collins. Him and his agent are incredibly mistaken if he thinks he's in that tier of players. Jarret Allen, Tim Hardaway Jr, Duncan Robinson, all got paid less and are probably more sought after than schroder. The clippers have their back against the cap wall and gave big contract extensions to Morris and Kennard last year and those are both ~15/year compared to Schroder's 21/year. There's just no comparison in the league."
"I think they are pretty similar in terms of size and pace. But that's also why I said ""I see some John Wall in him"" instead of ""he literally is a carbon copy of John Wall"". And I think it's more likely Suggs develops into a high level playmaker than a high level scorer."
"people keep comparing him to all these high assist point guards but im not confident in him being a high-level distributor in the half court, at least certainly not yet.  i really dont see any john wall in him aside from their ability to block shots."
I see some John Wall in him as well  He just needs to improve his finishing and he'll be an all star level player easily
"Why does everyone think the Thunder have the ability to magically “rehab” value? I think they honestly just didn’t want to clog the PG rotation for the young guys who need minutes and they wanted to continue the reputation of being played friendly...plus they saved money overall.   They still have the dead cap count against their salary over the two seasons though, no escaping that part.  Also, there really only was one worst contract in the league at this point anyways, John Wall...so the carousel had probably reached its end anyway."
"""still less than john wall"""
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
John Wall yes. Blazers trading CJ for a Clippers package? Hell no
John Wall or CJ McCollum seem possible.
Would there be some way to trade Eric Gordon and John Wall to the Clippers for short and/or cheap contracts?   John Wall + Eric Gordon   For   Rajon Rondo + Patrick Beverly + Marcus Morris (or Luke Kennard)   Surprisingly works in the trade machine. Would the Rockets want to just dump Wall’s and Gordon’s salary? I don’t know enough about how Gordon played.
Lol Since when were the Clippers too good for the John Wall experience?
That’s entirely reliant on both playing to be tradable. John Wall didn’t look too hot this season and Ben working with less spacing doesn’t help him either
John Wall straight up lol
"I thought Maxey was the bargaining chip the 6ers didn’t want to give away, it was Ben, Thybulle I think 2 firsts and the rockets wanted Maxey too. Because tbh, I couldn’t give a shit about Simmons being on rockets because we already have John Wall, fuck are we going to do with 2 non shooters with huge contracts?"
"Westbrook definitely is. John Wall is one of the worst contracts in the league, and they were only a protected first round pick apart"
"Nah he's better than John Wall.  But Simmons has 2 more years under contract than Wall so there's that, too."
John Wall is a fucking douchebag
Wow I’m so owned. Me the Ben Simmons fan that I am ...completely devastated. Have fun with KPJ and John wall bud
"He’s not a player a rebuilding team should have.  Especially since Rockets already have John Wall. They aren’t doing anything for the next few years, we should just rank and get picks, not get a $38M dollar player who cannot shoot."
Agreed. The team had already regressed back to average before the playoffs even started. We just got lucky that we got to play a John Wall-less Wizards in the second round before getting smoked by the Cavs
"that undersized player you like really could be your team's PJ Tucker.  those alt uniforms your team got this year are terrible.  Marv Albert sure is old and confused!  Nothing that happens before the playoffs matters at all ever!  teams that lose in the playoffs are humiliating and they probably should fire everybody!  referees should be fined for making bad calls. Their families should also probably be punished!  This draft class is definitely going to be the best in sooo long!  NBA players are vaccine-skeptical and if you think that's dumb listen I want to explain some history stuff to you...  Australians and Kiwis are such a delight.  Khris Middleton is just so underrated.  Kevin Love, John Wall, and Demarcus Cousins are all completely done and will never play good basketball ever again!"
"Ben for Eric Gordon,  Ben for John Wall,  Ben for Kemba,  3 Way - Ben to Bulls, Kemba to Sixers - Vuc to Celtics,  Ben for Love,  Ben for Pat Bev and Kennard,  The saddest trade ever = Ben for KP,  Ben for CJ,  Ben for KCP and Kuzma,  Ben for Derrick White,  Ben for Bledsoe,  Ben for Buddy,  Ben for Shia (saves sixers a lot of money as the Thunder have massive trade exceptions and the Thunder would get a premier tank commander)"
"???? His rep was ruined because Russ and the whole thunder seemed to take issue with him. Russ is 6886 times more popular, people mostly went with that.   On the pistons, he led the league in 4th quarter scoring one year and was a legit good player. The whole time, people shit on him for being a toxic ballhog that wanted “John wall money” even though he was playing excellently.   Then he got had a year or two heavily affected by injuries. Nobody watched the pistons, that’s why he, Marcus Morris, and Bruce brown were all pretty underrated immediately after leaving and are all performing well in the playoffs."
Funny thing is John Wall is on the Rockets so even if they wanted to make that trade I doubt Tilman goes for it. They already offered Simmons and picks for Harden which would’ve been better than what they got but here they both are.
John Wall
"It's possible PG makes it, reasonable chance like I said. Is DeMar Derozan making it? John Wall? Rondo? Blake Griffin? Kevin Love?   PG is clearly better than most of these guys, but in terms of overall career success, he's not really differentiated himself that much from a lot these guys.   There is a chance some of these guys will make it, and I think PG has made a case for himself over his career. But to call him a ""definition of a hall of fame player"" or guaranteed ""future first ballot hall of famer"" as the image in the post says is a wild exaggeration.   Let's just agree that he could make the hall of fame, and not delve into wild guarantees or hyperbole. It isn't hard to recognize PGs accomplishments without exaggerating like this post does."
"&gt;one impressive win Why am I not surprised a Westbrick fan can't even count properly, they won FOUR games without him and would've won even more. John wall was out for the season they were better with a healthy wall than the liability nobody in the league wanted even as a dump lmao"
Now you’re just in denial congratulations the wizards had one impressive win without Westbrook now they’re better without him and for some reason you can’t answer my question of why the wizards couldn’t make the playoffs last year even though Westbrook wasn’t on the team and you can’t say because of John wall because according to you even without John wall the wizards are still better then when they have Westbrook
Last year they were actually tanking. This year they were playing at 100% against tanking teams in the second part of the season and they were still 34-38  Not to mention that John Wall didn't play last year
just like john wall in his rookie season
John Wall is in my experience the best PG in the game. He slices so fast and is nearly unstoppable when you drive. It’s so stupid lol
Also having Westbrook on the court running the bench is still better than having John Wall run it from the hospital.
John Wall
"Russ had in some ways had a just as good year in Houston, though also had a bad playoffs   The only offers that were reportedly on the market were for John Wall and two others. The Knicks and the Hornets who were interested in taking Russ for basically free. They did not want to send any young players or picks whatsoever  His value might be slightly higher as now he has one less year on his contract (2 instead of 3) but in general, there was not much of a market then, and there won’t be now  Though some desperate contender might try and string together something. Like the Lakers or Clippers. But neither have much of the ability to match’s salaries"
"Anthony Edwards, Larry bird, Lebron James, jerry west, shaquille o Neale, John wall, Pete Maravich . Just some off the top of my head who have a lot of wow moments, especially bird"
"Austin Rivers HS mixtape was always pretty sick to me. Doc Rivers, Cory Joseph and John Wall are all in it too. Pretty sure Austin wears his Dads jersey in a dunk contest which was pretty cool.  Edit: https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=160&amp;v=OJX8YUrItR8&amp;feature=emb_logo"
"But that's three years ago, these cats don't even remember John wall was on our team I swear"
"Also sulked after they traded Westbrook for a shit John wall. Should've ran it back with Westbrook, they were starting to mesh before covid-19 hit"
"You have to be good at drafting for that to happen. Their Current GM has been a high ranking member of the organization since 2003. Go look at their draft picks in that span. They have drafted TWO players that became consistent starters. One was John Wall who was a massive star in college and the first pick the other was Beal who they drafted ahead of Dame. The only other decent players they drafted Swaggy P, Rui Hachimura, and Jordon Clarkson who didn't play a game before they traded him for cash. They drafted Otto Porter 3rd overall."
Because last year was pretty much the most fun I’ve had watching wizards basketball in recent memory. Sure they didn’t have playoff success but I watched every game and had tons of fun. A rebuild doesn’t guarantee fun or success. You still have to get lucky and have an outstanding front office for a rebuild lead to a championship. We drafted john wall and bradley beal within a few years of each other and never even made the conference finals. Who knows how we’ll do building around a bunch of mid-late lottery picks instead.
"Eh, Brown's defense slipped noticeably last season, and while Beal isn't exactly a good defender I think he would be better if he didn't have to score as much as he does in WAS. A lot of people forget that Beal was considered a good defender back when he was second fiddle to John Wall in the Wizards' offensive pecking order. Beal also has the advantage as a passer between the two of them."
John Wall 😹
You joke but John Wall would be a player on your roster if you got him.
"Vet minimums all the way bby, come on John Wall start sandbagging for us."
"I never said it was likely. That was your assumption  Westbrook doesn’t have much value, with his skill set and contract most teams don’t want him so it’s not like the trade offers in the first place will be anything great. He was traded for a washed John Wall who already had 2 career ending injuries and a protected first round pick  Whether or not you think THT is a good player, I know I don’t. He has value in the league for his potential, Kuzma doesn’t have much value but he’s averaged nearly 20ppg a few seasons ago. I think he has some value at least. Whatever you wanna include in that Harrell if he opts into his player option, Caldwell Pope, Schroder sign a trade?  Westbrook is also from LA, he’s close friends with both AD and Lebron. Also if he’s on the Lakers he has a chance to compete for a title  It’s not that we think we can trade for every star, we can’t but they’re a lot players who’d like to play for our team, who grew up fans of our team and would like to add championships and get their number retired by our all time greats"
"We have dray who is elite passer/playmaker in his position. Curry who is above average passer/playmaker. Klay who is average passer. Along with poole, JTA, Looney, who are average passer. Not counting wiggs as he is salary filler. Supposing we get ben the lineup would be curry, klay, ben, dray, Wiseman(if he remains) or Looney. That is 3 guys who can't shoot at all. Defence is not everything. Yeah it is important but only when paired with solid enough offence, team can win championship. This lineup is wcf at best and most probably 2nd round exit. But beal would make our offence better while he is solid enough defender as we've seen during john wall days. In my point beal trade has mote upside.   Edit:If i was doing the trade i would trade wiggs 7 14 and other pick for beal with lineup of steph, beal, JTA, dray, bigjim in best case scenario with klay off the bench"
"Yeah there is, and Jalen Green will be a great player without a doubt.   But my second point still stands, and as you said as well, Jalen green will have to take on a smaller role due to many other mouths to feed(like you said, john wall, kpj, wood, kenyon martin jr even)  Hell, 24ppg as a rookie is the highest since Allen Iverson in 1997! Obviously Green is a great player, but circumstances combined with NBA difficulty make me think that 24ppg is highly unlikely for him."
John Wall is a pretty good tank commander
"I'm high on Jalen Green and 24ppg is possible but extremely unlikely.  G league stats are inflated a lot as OP said in his reply. For example, KPJ averaged 24/7 in the g league but 16/6 in the NBA. G league defense is leagues behind NBA, so it's a stretch to call them actual NBA guys.   Also, Rockets have a lot of high volume shooters like KPJ, Christian Wood, John Wall(assuming he doesn't get traded), hell even jsean Tate is gonna put up lots of attempts. I don't think he's gonna be the 1st option and even if he is 24ppg is a big stretch"
"Man I love John Wall and miss watching him at his best, but that contract is awful"
"John Wall is available just putting it out there, your favorite team should trade for him no doubt"
"I could make the argument that even giving away harden for free with no draft picks is better than acquiring Simmons.  Building a team around that guy in the rockets situation after harden would’ve been a death sentence. How would we ever improve with a capped out team, no draft picks or young assets, and Ben with John wall lmfao."
"We don’t disagree and I don’t think you realize that.  Trading Ben for role players is not comparable to signing kawhi or pg13 or cp3 or John wall.  Those are all moves I’d love the sixers to make!!!  Our best offer rn seems to be McCollum and trading for him ain’t getting us over the hump I can tell you that. You’re also ignoring that keeping Ben is also “taking a risk”.  It’s the nba, every player is technically a risk, it doesn’t only apply to trades."
"I'm not a Sixers fan, but I do like Embiid and Morey.  I think the issue here you're comparing apples to oranges.  Its a waste if you trade Ben and get some worse players.    But its also a waste if you keep him and your ceiling is the 2nd round of the playoffs.  At some point, you have to either accept this is where you're going to be, or take a chance.  Suns took a chance on old-ass, injury-prone, expensive CP3 and it worked out.  Sometimes teams will take a chance and it won't work out, like maybe Houston trading for John Wall.  Now they're team sucks even more and they don't have James Harden.  So if you don't want to take a chance, you can see your ceiling as how far Simmons can take you.  Since it looks like the middle of the Eastern playoffs, this would be a waste of Embiid's prime.  Or you can take a chance, sign some guys who may or may not work out, and just go for it like Toronto did with Kawhi, or Clippers did with Kawhi and PG13.  Your new acquisitions may not be better than Simmons on paper, but maybe they'll fit better or maybe a chance of scenery will get the team to overachieve."
"There was nothing really comparable to Lebron, but Tyson Chandler also looked like an adult playing with children in high school. Next best one I can think of would be John Wall. He has an all time Hoopmixtape."
"Are we talking in their prime?  For guys like John Wall, Boogie, Kemba, Klay, Kristaps, etc...that would change things quite a bit"
John Wall and Westbrook are both albatross contracts that got swapped for one another to medicore teams  Jrue's a 1-time All-Star that's fine as a 3rd option. Got traded for shit contracts and peanut picks.  Gordon was a S&amp;T I believe that was an overpay.  None of those really inspire confidence in your assertion.
lol buddy just last year john wall/westrbrook/gordon hayword/holiday all got traded. and you think it wont happen hhhaha
"No one mentions 2010, but all these guys would still be in their primes if they didn't all lose a leg.  &gt;John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Gordon Hayward, Paul George  Ooof, the number of catastrophic injuries on this list...."
"Might be a decent veteran presence I guess - also ideally John Wall handles the majority of the ballhandling so Green can focus on scoring.  That being said, he's still injury-prone so he's a much better tank commander than Westbrook."
Beal started his career playing with peak John Wall where he was much more off the ball and he played with ball dominant Westbrook this year so no reason to think he can't. He can move really well off the ball when he doesn't have to be the primary shot creator.
"Any deal with Oubre would be a one year thing, with the other years being non-guaranteed.  If they include Wiseman and some of their non-guaranteed players, then Oubre wouldn't need a big deal.     Say they target Siakam, they would have to send out around $25m to match salaries.  Wiseman is set to make about $9.1m.  Gary Payton II and Alen Smailagic are around $3.7m combined.  That leaves Oubre making around $12.2m for one year.  The Warriors have two or three other guys on non-guaranteed deals, so they could drop Oubre's needed salary down another $1.8m-5.4m.      Even without Wiseman, it'd be about $21m for one year of Oubre.  That's around what Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and Garry Harris will make next year.  Yeah, it's not good, but it's not Kevin Love or John Wall bad.  Would be a legendary tax bill though for the Warriors though."
"Every single Wilt thread man. It's insane how many people actually believe that he was some kind of mythical creature or something lol.   Stronger than Shaq and faster than John Wall, some people really are gullible."
While maybe true. It's about slowing down and accelerating at John wall level that would make him insane. Wilt took a while to get going and to slow down.
Yeah.... wilt was stronger than Shaq and faster than John wall haha
the speed is the biggest thing. anyone over 7ft with actual john wall speed would be biology defying.
Is everyone just expecting Klay to return &amp; be 90% of what he was? Dude had 2 of the worst injuries you could have as a basketball player. Klay Thompson's contract could be John Wall-level bad right now. I'd be trying to move him if possible.
And you think the Wizards wouldn't be in the same situation if they had kept John Wall instead?
Where does john wall fit with Jalen Suggs going to Houston?
John Wall
The hate is mostly about what his value is now.  When considering the cap hit from his contract and his currently reduced performance for whatever reason his spot on the roster has one of the most negative values in the league.  His career puts him above someone like Shawn Kemp and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.  The issue is that his current contract puts him in Tobias Harris or John Wall territory.
"Green,KPJ, Christian Wood, and JaeSean Tate would be fun to watch. Hope they find a way to move John Wall. Not optimistic about that"
Ben Simmons for John Wall and a sweetner.
Another flawed max contract player.  Source: A hobbled CP3 and John Wall
I wanted KD to join you guys in 2016 so John Wall could get a ring :'(
"If that's your definition of a super team, then the Lakers with Lebron and AD are not a super team, but you just said even Lebron and AD are a super team.   When John Wall was healthy, he was a max contract player. Looking at it with hindsight is fucking stupid."
"So what?  John Wall has made $80 million to play just 40 games in the past two years.  The play and credentials are what we're talking about, not how much a player is being paid."
"But John Wall was literally traded a year ago. Ergo, not untradeable.  Please trade for John Wall."
"Nope, Westbrook staying put. May I recommend John Wall instead."
"John Wall     Bradley Beal     Bernard King or Bobby Dandridge         Elvin Hayes     Wes Unseld  Only needed $3900, suck it."
John Wall
"Tobi has played into his contract over the past couple of seasons, as far as pure untradeable worst contracts go, John Wall is up there with his super max."
"if the 2018 1 seed Raptors beat Wizards with no John Wall, Cavs with no LeBron, and Celtics with no Kyrie/Hayward/Horford I wouldn’t fucking respect it lol"
"As the great John Wall once said ""fuck is wrong with you boy"""
"Yeah but i don’t think John walls value is all that high, I wouldn’t be sure to trade Kennard and Morris for Wall and then add more players or picks to it.  The best bet is to see if wall gets bought out, which he might.  If people thought Westbrook’s contract couldn’t be traded and the dude averaged a triple double idk why people expect wall to be traded when he’s owed over 40 million a year"
"In that case, John Wall."
y’all know that teams actually want Simmons right? the Sixers aren’t gonna salary dump him to get fucking John Wall
He was essentially a combination of Dame and John Wall. Fast guard with good shooting. Would've had a decent career if it wasn't for injuries and the fact that he liked being goofy.
The rockets should Trade John wall for two bags of peanuts and half crusted pie.. Nothing less and nothing more..
"And how about.....John Wall lol.  The guy they're getting for Bledsoe.  Also, Kennard gets paid like a contributor.  Justise could get some minutes if he's ever healthy."
"Came in to the league with chip on his shoulder due to late draft pick. Improved a lot and supposedly flipped a coin to decide where to sign after his rookie contract (going to opposite team that coin designated).  Went to Washington for a bigger role and apparently somewhat similar relationship with his coach there to what AI had in philly, although admittedly not necessarily as turbulent. Basically Arenas wanted to score and coach wanted him to be pure point guard. Basically had Harden type of game without that level of passing.  Seemingly they found some kind of middle ground and did quite well. Arenas became known for hitting buzzer beaters.. and missing crucial free throws in the playoffs vs cavs after James said something like ""You know if you miss these we will hit the game winner"" to his ear before those free throws. Overall though he was one of the best scorers in the league at the time and all going pretty well.  Then knee injury, which was the main issue. Also gun incident (which seems bigger issue than it would have been if he could still play at superstar level). Then John Wall was drafted and Arenas was in this ""Could he still come back and be good?"" category for a while.  Turns out he couldn't and tried to play some in Orlando as well and eventually China if I recall right and then started making youtube videos. [He can still shoot though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPmDPzPOkqM&amp;ab_channel=NoChillProductions) Now does the talk show stuff, which I personally am not huge fan of but he seems to enjoy it.  I do hope to see him more on like pro am's and other that kind of leagues talking trash and scoring a lot. Feel like that's where his personality and talents would fit very well and I'd imagine would be fun for him too."
is john wall going to go from a supermax to a vet min lol
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but you will no longer have John Wall on your payroll following a trade, no? Congratulations then, you won the trade"
"CP3 also suited up for a tanking Thunder team and took them to within a shot of making the second round. No one expected that team to win any games. Their over/under wins line was below 30.  Westbrook hasn't had a season as bad as Wall's was last year since he was on his rookie contract. I agree that he hasn't played on a team as bad as last year's Rockets.  Wall was injured, but he scored less points on worse efficiency with a higher usage rate than Westbrook, let alone playing worse in every other aspect. He shouldn't have been the number one option with Wood on the team, but he resorted to hero ball and it was ugly.  I like John Wall and hope he can succeed, but these injuries really have messed up his athleticism. He was worth his contract when it was signed as one of the best defensive PGs in the league and a great and explosive playmaker. But there's no doubt this contract really is proving itself to be a great deal worse than the other supermaxes."
"sounds like john wall really hit the, uh, himself."
Reminder that John Wall is tied for the 2nd highest contract in the NBA
"I don’t know how the Clippers can make that trade work  Morris, and Kennard would have to be in the trade and I’m not sure both of those contracts match John Walls contract  I don’t see the Rockets being desperate to trade Wall while the Clippers still want to compete and maybe have John Wall when Kawhi gets back"
Ben Simmons for John Wall - two overhyped 1st round 1st overall draft picks.  Washed up - both of them.  Both of them care more about the fame then actually being good and getting better.  Perfect trade.  To think - these two were both first overall picks!  Sad.
"like have you ever watched john wall play he’s a point guard   where do you get off saying he has zero playmaking?  he’s an elite playmaker, that’s well known and statistically supported"
John Wall lobbing to Giannis 24x a game
"That’s what the report says.    1. Heat made an offer  2.  Only large salaries on the roster are Butler, Adebayo, Lowry.  3.  Butler or Adebayo aren’t getting moved for John Wall they are too valuable.  4. Lowry is only reasonable player that could be offered because of salary matching."
"I remember that he said Anthony Morrow was one of the three players he wanted to play with most, but we signed him that 2010 summer, so maybe it was after. Still, John Wall, Lebron, and a young Brook would have been nice, no Heatles, but still pretty nasty."
"“Have to win this trade hub, John wall is no James harden so there screwed there! Trade him for Ben Simmons and make Philadelphia throw in 4 draft picks lol"
Monkey's Paw: The Phoenix Suns have traded Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton for John Wall. The Suns will now be paying veteran guards Wall and Chris Paul a combined $75 million this coming season.
"Even before that cp3 was still a good player just overpaid and Westbrook was still averaging a triple double. So no it’s not comparable at all.   John wall hasn’t had an opportunity because he’s literally suffered back to back season ending injuries. You insisting he can still be good is like insisting IT is still good enough to be on a roster. It has nothing to do with his situation, he’s just flat out washed. The dude has nothing left. He lost most his athleticism and he can’t play defense anymore. He’s a guy who relied entirely on his speed and quickness on both ends of the floor. He’s torn an Achilles and blown out his knee. He is DONE"
"You're looking at CP3 and Westbrook *after* they did these things.   Before that Westbrook was the worst contract in the league, same with CP3 as well. The outlook changed because they proved themselves in the postseason.   John Wall hasn't had that opportunity since his injury, because he came back to a tanking Rockets team that had nothing to play for."
John Wall to Bucks
I'm sure that absolutely everything we're seeing regarding John Wall and Houston these days is them just posturing to try to create a market that doesn't exist and trying to pressure Wall into giving a lot back in a buyout. They know they're totally stuck with an utterly toxic contract and are desperately trying to figure out something other than paying him over $90 million to do nothing for the next two years.
"This upcoming season, John Wall will be a Naket."
You win the trade by trading John wall and getting any expiring contract
Great move by the Rockets. John Wall would only really impede the playing time of all the young guards they have.
Have a feeling Clippers are gonna trade for him and end up getting a prime John wall lmao
"I know it’s a bad contract and we don’t need him. But as a Kentucky fan and as a Heat fan, if John Wall went to Miami I would buy that jersey so fast they wouldn’t know what hit them."
uh maybe there's a way for the pistons to absorb john wall at the beginning of the 2022-23 season?
"I interpret this list as players who you feel obligated to pay because you don’t want to lose them for nothing, rather than players on obviously bad contracts like John Wall.  G: Ben Simmons G: Chris Paul F: Demar Derozan F: John Collins C: Jonas Valenciunas"
"John wall old now ain’t he, and tons of injuries. Good luck trying to field him for a “win”. It’s not 2012 anymore"
Yo imagine they trade him for John Wall
"I don’t know John wall at all but I know his story just from reading, he and rich Paul gonna make sure John gets every dime he’s owed"
"PG: John Wall, SG: Kelly Oubre, PF: Julius Randle, SF: Jimmy Butler, C: James Wiseman.  Opinion based on current contracts."
John Wall gonna become a journeyman?
"John Wall and Stephen Curry as PG and SG while Klay is out would be an interesting backcourt. That means GS can play Curry, Wiggins, Looney, and a stretch 4 even without Draymond."
Who got paid more for less - Gilbert Arenas or John Wall?
"How is the heat gonna make this trade? I don't think John wall fits well with the clippers and clippers really have nothing to offer besides Luka kennard, morris and etc. Heat already has lowry so I'm not sure how much John wall helps them In this regard."
not a fan of giving up mann for a guy like wall that has constant injury problems. Wld ofc do it in a heartbeat for a guy maybe less talented than john wall but can actually show up to games healthy
You’re not gonna sit here and say John wall isn’t a big name lmao. Bye. I’m done
"I think they learned with Harden that disparaging and lowering the value of the star you're trying to trad by leaking all his negative crap may not be in the interest of getting the best trade.  Wall has 0 value with his injury history and contract value, this is very smart to make him a sensible veteran influence to bring at least a glimmer of value.  John ""a Rock"" Wall is what we'll see out from houston now"
"John Wall isn’t a big name player man, he was but the injuries derailed him. There’s a reason no team will trade for his $44mil contract.  There’s solutions to the problems you’re describing but what you’re offering just isn’t it. And at least mention and look into what happened with the Pelicans and AD if you’re going to go the route of the nba forcing a team to play a big name player"
"that wouldn't  be a bad return.  They've gotta swing for the fences and Bldsoe Luke don't really excite while Zu is servicable and solid, but taking some hope that john wall could be healthy and pairing him as a catalyst with their two elite wings might be a bet they want to make if the market is dry elsewhere."
"Yeah, I'm sure the Pistons want John Wall when they just drafted Cade or the Heat who just signed Lowry."
Comparing trading Harden to trading John Wall is a strategy I guess..
For sure. I would bet money for sure that John wall plays in at least 1 single nba game this season
Kemba had around 2 years 70 million left on his deal. The buy out itself was a little over 50 million. That's 40 million less than what John Wall would get if he was bought out right now.
"John wall and joel embiid, deadly combo there 76'ers fans lets make this 3 team trade happen.  /s"
John Wall signs to san antonio spurs.
"John Wall at PF next to Jarrett Allen?  He'll blow by most big men.  Won't rebound for shit, but there'll be a C/PF at every other position lol"
man john wall was the best PG in the east until 2017
This nephew really say that past his prime John Wall could even SNIFF goat 6th man status🤨
"John Wall was one of the fastest players in NBA history. That wasn't Arenas. Just saying a 6'4 Lillard is fine. Lillard is a great athlete, too."
you really comparing Post ASG Russell Westbrook with Current John Wall?!
John Wall isn’t a top 10 player in his prime my friend
"Before the injuries, imagine a player like Dame Lillard, plus the speed of John wall and able to finish in the paint. Agent 0 was a legit player, after his knee injury he was never the same. Plus he had a lot of off the court/ on court drama that affected him."
Aditional Info: Houston is not willing to package First Round Picks in a John Wall trade.
"Unless the rockets want to add draft incentive, its highly doubtful they can move this contract.  I don't see why the Rockets would add draft incentives, so either John Wall give up a lot of money, or he sits on the bench the whole season."
Is John Wall bad now?
Zero. The number of teams willing to trade for John Wall.
John Wall deserves a statue outside the Toyota center.  The best tank commander that got the rockets Jalen Green. Then now essentially benching himself so that Kevin Porter Jr can start.
"""I'm just here so I don't get fined"" - John Wall 2021"
Because he’s a star and wanted to play. Sitting an injured and old John Wall isn’t hurting attendance numbers
"I'm just saying that John Wall could be part of a ""reasonable package"".  The key downside would be that Simmons has a risk of having a very bad contract for a very long time...whereas Wall's contract is only bad for the next couple years, after which they should have completed their rebuild."
"Trading Wall will be next to impossible...but who says no?  PHI gets:  John Wall, Caris Lavert, TJ Warren, Chris Duarte, and picks from HOU  HOU gets: Kristaps Porzingis   DAL gets: Tobias Harris   IND gets: Ben Simmons"
"Unless John Wall is going to be really dumb and opt out of his 47m PO next year, there’s zero trades I see happening. Only chance is somebody on a 3 year deal who is also a bad culture fit and bad team fit, on a team that is also bottoming out for a rebuild.  If he was on any other team I’d be saying “Houston will take him”."

"John Wall isn't dead. He's can still dribble, pass, and shoot the basketball. He's not the fastest guy dribbling the ball like he was in 2013, but we have no reason to believe he can't be a great basketball player with proper motivation.  Injuries hardly matter as much as they did years ago."
"The Lakers would be better with John Wall than without John Wall, if all you're talking about is luxury money and a 14th roster spot.  I can guarantee they would find a way to give him meaningful, winning minutes. It's John Wall."
"No worries friend!  John wall is 31, and coming off a worse Injury than KP had. He’s 5 years older, and plays a position that Luka plays. The kind of point guard I would much rather is a guy like Dragic, Lowry, Brogdon, someone who can kind of play combo guard and can shoot a bit.  Wall shoots 30% from 3, and needs the ball, which isn’t a bad thing, he averaged 10.3 assists at his peak!   But from 2018 to 2020 he missed 41 games, 50 games and a full season.   So, he plays a relatively redundant position (we can’t likely play Luka. THJ and wall together) he can’t shoot, is even more injury prone than KP, and plays a position in which his loss of explosiveness will hurt him the most. KP has one more year on his contract but is also making nearly 15 million less next year  He averaged 20/9 last year on career high true shooting percentages. After it came out how Carlisle used KP, I’m cautiously optimistic that a healthy offseason and new coach is what we need  And I don’t want to sacrifice our only other guy who can create a shot and score 20+ to get an old Injured $45 million point guard who can’t shoot."
John Wall isn't good anymore. He cannot positively contribute to a Championship team
&gt;is a way for them to avoid fines for tanking.  If you really want to tank you play John Wall 40 minutes a game
This reads like an Onion article when you realize they are talking about John Wall
John “Becomes The” Wall
"I’ll make it easier for you  Young guys need reps to improve  John wall takes reps  “The team is going to be bottom 5 regardless, why not take reps away from the young guys? They don’t need to improve.” is essentially your point."
John wall would be great coming off the bench playing 20mpg or so. If hes willing to embrace that role at this point of his career it would be a blessing for him.
"Ben Simmons for John Wall actually makes sense. I know Wall paid more, so might have to get third team involved... But I can see Sixers intrigued by a Wall/Embiid pairing."
Lol here come the John Wall puff pieces
I want to see John wall on the pelicans or the Knicks
"John Wall has almost $100M left   Blake’s contract was smaller, if I remember correctly"
Valid point that he is definitely not the player he was. I guess I really wish he was still the player he was as I was a big John Wall fan.
"Flex to the left, throw some money out ya hands  Do it for the city and we do it for the fans   To ball like Wall, boy, you gotta do the dance  Everybody do the John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall"
"John Wall for Ben Simmons straight up, who says no? /s"
Right so would you trade two picks for Ben Simmons is the question? It’s not just about giving up John Wall.
John Wall to Sixers for Simmons
John Wall for Ben Simmons  It’s happening!!!!
"Yea so the general consensus I get is that both teams should not do the trade. This is actually interesting in itself. It means the trade isn’t lopsided, but it also means both fan bases don’t seem to think it improves their team.   Also to answer your other question, yes in order to get Ben Simmons, they pretty much have to trade it unprotected. I assume Sixers would never trade Simmons away otherwise.   Also I agree CJ &gt; Ben, but does CJ help the Sixers beat the Nets/Bucks is my question. That’s why I was thinking in my scenario, Sixers can almost punt this season in a way. I don’t think Malik Beasley is necessarily better than John Wall though."
john wall ben simmons straight up and we dont talk about it anymore
"You aren't wrong, but it's not like a tanking team really needs that money at the moment. Also John Wall shooting the Rockets out of games isn't the worst thing in the world."
"John Wall off the bench would be great for most teams, but I doubt he’d accept that."
"John Wall is still a great PG, but yeah, with that albatross of a contract, no ones going to want him. He’s not agreeing to a buyout this year"
"John ""Beast Mode"" Wall"
6man John wall would potentially be absurd if he stays healthy
I know for a fact the Rockets told Wall that they would not play him more than 15 minutes a game this year (John said don't play me at all then) because the Rockets were tanking.  SO this is the correct take.
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
"John Wall  Paul George and John Wall are best buds.  If Paul wants him and Eric is anything less than ""very helpful"", I fully expect this trade to go down... Stars get what they want and bad contracts get moved when stars ask for them."
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
Fine me for that! - John Wall
Cavs get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: John Wall and picks  Rockets get: KLove &amp; Tyrese Maxey
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
"Nah, he coached the John Wall Wizards to close playoff losses against Toronto and Boston in his first two years, and that's when the Wizards were kind of buzzing as a dark horse  contender in the east. And then Wall got injured for two years while Brooks was still coaching."
"Yeah, and John Wall needs athleticism more than Klay does. So, yeah, hopefully it all goes well."
John Wall gives me hope
Why would the expansion team want to do that? I get maybe like a kinda bad contract like John Wall to get fans in the stands but why would a team want to be in salary cap hell to start?
"Ted Leonsis (the owner of the Wizards) really forced a trade of the face of the franchise and a HERO in the community for a player with national media attention. John Wall was traded for Westbrook for profit not to win basketball games. Ted Leonsis owns the only sportsbook in DC and is currently lobbying for sports betting to not be considered gambling for a larger amount of patrons to bet, and to prey on at-risk demographics. Fuck Ted Leonsis. https://twitter.com/MrMichaelLee/status/1334349940806574081?s=20"
"Until this season, John wall"
KOC also said Harden is obviously getting traded before the season immediately after the John Wall trade and said the Wizards won the trade
"Probably like a John Wall type, a top point guard in the league without a ring. Also a pretty out there guy."
i haven't been watching enough - how is john wall doing? his stats look good
A weirdo John Wall without an achilles injury.
"Uhh you're really saying DLO is on the same level as multi time all stars?  Even though he is much more inefficient?  Ja Morant is better, healthy john wall, Zach Lavine, Jamal Murray, Malcom Brogdon. Sorry bro DLO is like 20-30 range for starting PGs.  He is not worth that contract in any way."
While John Wall shared the court as well for a total of 6 clients on the floor at the same time lol.
He just needs to clean up things like doubling off of John wall on the strong side. I yelled at the tv when I saw him drop down
This is probably the worst Harden Rockets team in a long time. John Wall can't do anything but drive into a packed paint. The paint is packed because there are no threatening shooters on the team (maybe except for McLemore). Harden's either washed or acting like a pathetic diva (either is bad news). Christian Wood just pads his points and does little else (dude only had 3 rebounds as a center!)
"Westbrook has the 2nd highest salary in the league.  He was traded for #3 then #4.  It's only natural that he'd be traded for #5 next.    * Stephen Curry $43,006,362					 * **Russell Westbrook $41,358,814** * **Chris Paul $41,358,814** * **John Wall $41,254,920** * James Harden $40,824,000	 * LeBron James $39,219,565	 * Kevin Durant $39,058,950	  ^^/s"
"Supermax player is gonna be the answer to this question from now on until rules change, Wiggins contract fucking sucks, but it’s nothing compared to the sheer amount someone like John wall is being payed just due to the cap hit. Ignoring cap ramifications,  In a pure skill to dollar ratio, though, it’s still pretty fucking bad"
Can we get some clips of John Wall attempting to guard Montrezl in the post?
John wall with the armpit tattoo... that must fucking hurt
Did John Wall just do a karate kick follow through?
I’ve missed John Wall man. Glad to see him playing well after all this time.
