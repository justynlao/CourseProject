"That article is about Jackson Frank's tweets, Jackson Frank is an analyst on Twitter and someone I would classify as a die-hard fan.  The NBA is not catering to die-hard fans."
(mummy from ATHF voice)  JACKSON FRANK!!!!
yeah but utah’s got frank jackson tho
"I definitely think this would be more accurate not just going off of birthplace. Living in Utah, John Collins was born on a military base and barely spent any time here. I think the best active player from here (spent most of their childhood and teenage years) is Frank Jackson. I think overall it would be more accurate if it was done that way other than just birthplace"
Yes the roster is weird...  But Frank Jackson and E’Twaun Moore wouldn’t be the pieces that’d fix it lol.
"The Pistons already need two GLeague teams. Have you seen their roster after Rose, Griffin, Okafor, and... is Frank Jackson still there? I know he signed after the Thunder moved on from him."
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
Jah? Frank Jackson?  give a little credit where it’s due man
"remember when u guys said 2017 was the best draft class in 15 years when guys like Fultz, Joe Jackson, Lonzo, Frank and DSJ were picked in the top 10..."
Don't forget JJ and Ingram. They were even Duked out with Okafor and Frank Jackson at one point too
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
Okay I’ll pretend to be Chuck when they make him guess where players are. Exum-Jazz Okafor-Hornets Mudiay-Magic Johnson-kings Winslow-Memphis Bender-Suns Dunn-Bucks Maker-76ers Skal-raptors Jackson-Phily Frank-Bucks DSmithJr-Dallas Leaf-Washington Bacon-Rockets Bagley-Getting Traded Bamba-Hornets Zhaire-OKC Wagner-suns
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
Frank Jackson lmao
"Eh, the WNBA has been badly mismanaged. When Candace Parker, Delle Donne, Griner, and Maya Moore were hitting the league in the mid 2010s, and vets like Taurausi, Bird, and Lauren Jackson were still in the tail end of their primes, half the teams were profitable.   It's a players' league, the success of the league is the success of marketing stars. And to be frank, the NBA owns 50% of the WNBA. They don't want to cannibalize NBA revenue, they're not AT ALL interested in getting core NBA fans into the WNBA."
"Last year in the finals, Jackson said something to the effect of ""Frank Vogel's ring counts less because he had so much talent"" . . . when Jackson failed to do anything with Steph/Klay/Dray/Iggy. Real smooth brain take and real disrespectful to Vogel."
"Yea man I’m totally with you. I loved rooting hard for guys like Randle, Cheick Diallo (idk where tf he even is now), Frank Jackson, Kenrich Williams, etc.  There’s definitely a special connection you grow with a team during that time."
trade zion and ingram to the pistons for blake and frank jackson

i too enjoy jackson frank but he presumably utilizes thesaurus.com whenever he publishes on twitter. a plethora of surplus descriptors to articulate that an individual is quality at distributing.
Lol Jackson frank was on my XC team in HS.
JACKSON FRANK
i like jackson frank but he for sure uses thesaurus.com every time he tweets. so many unnecessary adjectives to say someone is good at passing
"Shoutout Jackson Frank, my favorite nba Twitter follow"
"I don’t remember if we lost 50 games, but the 2018-2019 second half of the season Pels were a lot of fun to watch. The roster sans AD was Jrue and a bunch of scrappy guys including Jahlil Okafor, Kenny Hustle, Stanley Johnson, Dairis Bertans, Ian Clark, Frank Jackson and Christian Wood (😥).   I remember we beat Denver and Utah on the road then got 40 pieced by Orlando. Good times."
If Karim Mane was that dude he would be starting PG instead of Frank Mason. This organization drafted Justin Jackson (Maryland) a while back too what happen to him
"He was actually decent in NY too. Before the KP injury that team was around the 6-seed and the PG's were Jarret Jack and 18 Y/O Frank Ntilikina. The second best player was THJ.  In addition to running a Phil Jackson system, the guy did as well as anybody could. I think at the time I just thought he was meh, but it's clear that you can do much worse. Hornacek is an NBA level head coach even if it's in the middle tier. There are definitely worse coaches out there than him."
"Hayes has been out indefinitely since early Jan with a labral tear. Without him and Rose our PGs are Delon Wright, Frank Jackson, &amp; 2nd round rookie Saben Lee. He'll get plenty of minutes."
"The Pistons are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA - so I'd say a F.  The team's only pure shooters are Wayne Ellington (a vet who needs other to get him shots) Saddiq Bey (a rookie who is still inconsistent) &amp; Frank Jackson (a 2-way player who is shooting well form 3 for the first time in his career).  On top of that, the only offensive creators on the team are Jerami Grant (who is not yet a good passer), Hamidou Diallo (who only recently arrived in Detroit) and Josh Jackson (who is very inefficient).   On a bright side - the Pistons actually have a solid defensive team."
"Just for the record and all, those CotY and EotY awards were complete nonsense.  Bird took over a Pacer team that had won 50+ games repeatedly, but struggled to 39 for one season due to injury.  They then won 58 with the same roster, and Bird was given CotY apparently for keeping his players healthy -- no one without his reputation and name wins that.  The EotY was apparently for taking the 37-45 2010-11 Pacers and turning them into the 42-24 2011-12 Pacers.  I guess hiring Frank Vogel was smart, but other guys have done that, too, and Vogel is not exactly Phil Jackson.  He did draft Paul George at #10, but he was unremarkable until years later.  He also drafted Kawhi Leonard at #15, but traded him and Davis Bertans for George Hill -- which didn't look too terrible at the time, but is, ahem, highly questionable today.  [This](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/IND/2012_transactions.html), is Executive of the Year material?"
Frank Jackson
"To be honest, I'd still rather would have had Frank Jackson than Bledsoe or Redick for most of the season."
"Cute of you to think Casey would let him play 38 minutes. He'd split time with Frank Jackson and every fifth game, usually after a really strong outing, he'd get 13 minutes the next night."
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
I’ll try for our team:  • Jerami Grant • Mason Plumlee • Saddiq Bey • Isaiah Stewart • Wayne Ellington • Dennis Smith Jr. • Saben Lee • Josh Jackson • Frank Jackson • Rodney Mcgruder
"Sure, throw 18 minutes at Frank Jackson.  Why not.  I forgot he was still on the team."
Frank Jackson has been fantastic lately.
"And you guys win regardless of the scenario, if the pistons were tanking they would’ve played frank jackson and mcgruder significant minutes, while resting seddiq bey and Stewart who are playing very good recently"
Another deep cut for me is frank jackson. Dude just non stop moving and always finding ways to get open to create offense with the second unit
"To maybe find a middle ground, I liked the Adams trade, but I didn't like the extension. When Favors left, we were left with absolutely no startable big men. Christian Wood had been released the year prior and gone to Detroit, and showed real promise there. Jahlil Okafor would have 24 good seconds in a game before his athleticism just made him a liability. He had some good games, but they were few and far between. Finally, Hayes was too young and inexperienced, he wasn't even supposed to play NBA minutes in his rookie year when the Pelicans drafted him.  All this to say that they needed a big man, and unless they wanted to pay for someone like Aaron Baynes, dumping those picks and guys they weren't resigning or had previously planned to release like Frank Jackson and Kenrich Williams seems like a fair tradeoff to me. But like you've said, the extension was not good when compared to market value, and the fact that you can find a low cost center in free agency in the off-season, or a better trade candidate.  Some people argue that he was also an extension target because of his attitude he brings to the team. I think that's pretty crappy speculation, we have no reason to believe that's anything more than wishful thinking for a fanbase."
"Lol is he wrong? Grant wasn't really ""trash"" per say, but Frank Jackson and Josh Jackson most definitely were. DSJ looked solid too but he's been injured for a while."
"Basically our entire team this year. Diallo, Grant, Josh Jackson, Frank Jackson"
"Because of the last month?  - Blew a 10 point lead late against the Knicks on missed free throws - Fumbled away a close game in the last minute against the Pacers - Blew a late lead against the Mavs on that Luka bullshit - Lost a heartbreaker we should've won against the Nuggets (&gt; 80% win probability in the last 2 minutes of regulation, OT, and 2OT) - Got blown out by a Clippers team starting Morris, Zubac, Kennard, Mann, and Coffey - Got blown out by the Nuggets - Got blown out at home by the Blazers - Lost to a Magic team starting Wagner, Carter, Anthony, Harris, and Bacon - Scraped by a win against the damn Timberwolves - Got blown out by a Pistons team starting Bey, Doumbouya, Stewart, Joseph, and Frank Jackson (with only 4 players on the bench)  In all that we had a good win against the Bucks and two against the Blazers. That's it. We handled our business against the struggling Bulls and Wolves and the Magic (once)"
"About to drop some knowledge on you from a different thread, please hold:  I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"Yeah if we want to blatantly tank we’d bench Frank Jackson, Bey and Stewart. They are probably out three best players rn besides Grant."
"Full of excuses.   Tell me which young guys that okc are fielding now that you think will be back and have significant playing time next yr on your team. Every one of those that are playing right now are more or less just a stop gap just to field a losing team.  Who we are playing right now are essentialy hopefully our future. Hayes, Jj, bey, sekou, Stewart, frank Jackson, etc all of those are players that will be back next yr and will get significant playing time. We are tanking but not to the point of fielding a G-league team at all."
"You are VASTLY overstimating how much those picks are worth. 31st pick int he draft:  2020 Tyrell Terry, Stanford - Dallas Mavericks   2019 Nicolas Claxton, Georgia – Brooklyn Nets   2018 Elie Okobo, France – Phoenix Suns   2017 Frank Jackson, Duke – Charlotte Hornets   2016 Deyonta Davis, Michigan State – Boston Celtics   2015 Cedi Osman, Anadolu Efes – Minnesota Timberwolves   2014 Damien Inglis, France – Milwaukee Bucks   2013 Allen Crabbe, California – Cleveland Cavaliers   2012 Jeff Taylor, Vanderbilt – Charlotte Bobcats"

For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."

"[Pistons youth movement is genuinely exciting](https://twitter.com/RedAlternates/status/1387929113252405248?s=20):  - They have a bonafide interior threat big who covers a crazy amount of space on defense and is showing some 3pt shooting chopps in Stewart (19yo)  - They have a sharpshooting wing with great awareness and on ball D who is showing some ability to take the ball to the hoop and use his strength to finish in Bey (22yo)  - They have a stellar passing PG with incredible vision and great on-ball and help D in Killian (19yo)  - They have a raw project with Siakim-esque upside in Sekou (20yo)  - They have an athletic, sharpshooting bench sparkplug with HoF tier hair in Frank Jackson (22yo)  - And they have two athletic, multi-tool bench wings who play hard nosed defense in Josh Jackson (24yo) and Hamidou Diallo (22yo)  That's 6 players 22 or younger who could have lasting roles in Weaver's restoration (4 of whom are more or less locks) without counting Saben Lee or our 2021 pick. For context, before the moratorium lifted last fall, the only player on the team under 22yo was Sekou. Just an insane transformation in only 6 months."
"Josh Jackson has been alright in Detroit, but probably on the same level of impact as Frank."
"I’d disagree and I’m biased but context makes Rose’s mvp really impressive. Comparing MVP cases year to year is idiotic in the first place but I’m really sick and tired of people who never watched the NBA that year talk down what a player he was.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps.

How do you guard that?""*  **Frank Vogel**  &gt;*""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP.

That's remarkable.""*  **Charles Barkley**  &gt;*""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do.

He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""*  **Gregg Popovich**  &gt;*""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose.

If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""*  **Chris Bosh**  &gt;*""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader.

Shit it was the Frank Jackson revenge game the whole time
Frank Jackson was solid off the bench
"Both Wilt and Russell are credited with playing with eight other HOFers. There are some discernable differences, however. At some points in his career,   Chamberlain played with Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, Nate Thurmond, Hal Greer, Billy Cunningham, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Gail Goodrich.    Meanwhile, Russell played alongside Bob Cousey, Frank Ramsey, Bill Sharman, KC Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Heinsohn, John Havlicek, and Bailey Howell.  For the sake of the Russell-Wilt debate, though, let's break them down. Chamberlain played with Goodrich, but that was after Russell retired. He also played with Elgin Baylor, but contrary to popular opinion, he only actually played with Baylor for one semi-full season, in the '68-'69 season, and only two post-seasons.   Wilt missed most of the '69-'70 season, while Baylor missed almost the entire '70-'71 season (and post-season, as well), and Baylor retired after the first nine games of the '71-'72 season (and not coincidently, LA immediately went on their record-breaking 33 games winning streak BTW.) And, as I mentioned, Baylor played in two post-seasons with Wilt, and he was awful in both of them.    In fact, his idiotic coach preferred Baylor's offense over Wilt's and asked Chamberlain to sacrifice his scoring for Baylor's. Not only that, but Baylor was a baseline-to-baseline player, and Van Breda Kolf actually had Chamberlain playing a high post for the first half of the '68-'69 season.   The greatest low-post scorer in NBA history was asked to play a high-post??? The fact was, Baylor was already on a downward slide by the time Chamberlain joined LA, and I have always maintained that Baylor actually detracted from the Lakers from that point on. In any case, Baylor and Wilt hardly played together at all.  Continuing...  Chamberlain also played with Nate Thurmond, for one year...Thurmond's rookie year, in which Nate was asked to play at forward, and not his natural center position (where he would become a HOF player.)    Wilt also played alongside Paul Arizin, a legitimate HOFer, who was nearing the end of his career by the time Wilt came along. And, Wilt played with Tom Gola. Now, Gola was a four-time All-Star, and is in the HOF. However, he was hardly deserving of either. In his best season, he averaged 16 ppg. Over the course of his entire career, he averaged 11.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg, and shot .43,1 from the field.  Chamberlain was traded to the 76ers in the '64-'65 season and played there until the end of the '67-'68 season. They were a bottom-dwelling team when he arrived, though, and even with Wilt, they only had a 40-40 season in his first year (they were 34-46 the year before.) However, in the playoffs that season, Chamberlain led them to a crushing 3-1 series win over the 48-32 Royals, and then a game seven, one point loss to the 62-18 Celtics.   Philly added Billy Cunningham to the roster in the '65-'66 season, and they edged the Celtics by one game in that season (55-25 to Boston's 54-26.) Still, the Sixers were a young team, and while Boston declined slightly from the year before, they were still only a year removed from their best-ever record during their ""Dynasty.""  A case could be made that while the 76ers had a better record, they were probably not a better team. In any case, Wilt thoroughly outplayed Russell in the post-season that year (as he always did BTW), averaging 28 ppg, and 31 rpg, to Russell's 14 ppg and 26 rpg. But, Russell's teammates easily outplayed Wilt's, and Boston won the series, 4-1.  In the following season, the 76ers finally meshed, and they went on to a then-record 68-13 mark, easily outdistancing the Celtics, who had one of their best records during the ""Dynasty"", at 60-21. That Celtic team was loaded, too. They had five HOFers (Russell, Havlicek, Sam Jones, KC Jones, and Howell), along with Wayne Embry, Don Nelson, Larry Siegfried, and Jim Barnett.   Despite that talented roster, the 76ers, with HOFers Wilt, Greer, and Cunningham, as well as Luke Jackson, Chet Walker (who should be in the HOF), and Wali Jones,...  buried the Celtics, 4-1. And, once again, Chamberlain just crushed Russell in every statistical category in that post-season.  And the following season, '67-'68, the Sixers were well on their way to a duplication. They again ran away with the best record in the league, at 62-20, while Boston was a distant second at 54-28. Before the Eastern Finals, though, the Sixers lost Billy Cunningham to a wrist injury, and he would not return the rest of the year. Still, they managed to take a 3-1 series lead over Boston without him. Then, Luke Jackson went down with a leg injury in game five. On top of that, Wilt was nursing a variety of injuries, including two arthritic knees.    The Celtics roared back to tie the series, 3-3, and in-game seven Chamberlain only touched the ball twice on the offensive end in 4th quarter (and those were on offensive rebounds), and his teammates fired blanks all game long (they shot 33% in that game)...and Boston edged Philly 100-96 to win that series. There were several suspicious events that happened in that game seven, but I won't take the time to address them now.     In any case, Wilt's Sixers lost that game seven, by four points, despite not having Cunningham at all, with Jackson basically worthless from game five on, Wilt himself under 100%, and his team shooting an ungodly horrible percentage in that last game. I have long argued that the best team did not win the title that year.  But, back to my original point...which was basically this...  Take away Chamberlain's stint with the Sixers, and here is what we had: Throw out Goodrich, who never played with Wilt during the Russell era. Throw out Thurmond, who was a rookie playing out of position. Throw out a washed Baylor, who was more of a hindrance during his time with Wilt (especially in the playoffs.) Throw out Gola, who was no more of a HOFer than myself. What does that leave?    Wilt basically played with West and Arizin...and not together. So, aside from the Sixers, Wilt played with two quality players, and not at the same time. That was it. And Arizin was nearing the end of his career, and West suffered injuries in the '70-'71 season and missed the post-season.  Granted, Chamberlain played with talented rosters in Philly, at least from '66-'68 (Cunningham did not arrive until '66.) And, his team's only won one title in those three years. However, his teammates played poorly in the '66 playoffs, and his team was decimated with injuries in the '68 season.  Now, how about Russell's supporting cast? Unlike Wilt, who was drafted by a last-place team (that he immediately turned into a 48-32 team...and a close six-game series loss to Boston in the playoffs), ...Russell came to a playoff team. Yes, he was the final piece of the puzzle that took them over the hump. But, Auerbach also added more quality players each year. I have mentioned it many times, but Russell played alongside five other HOFers in the '61-'62 season,    while Wilt basically carried a last-place roster, with Arizin in his last year, and an over-rated Gola, to a game seven, a two-point loss to the Celtics in the playoffs. There was simply no comparison in talent levels on those two teams...yet Wilt almost single-handedly led that team to an upset over a vaunted Celtic team.  Here is a breakdown of Russell's supporting cast in the decade in which he battled Wilt:  Two of his HOFers were questionable HOFers to be sure. Frank Ramsey was a career 13.4 scorer. And KC Jones was never even an all-star (although he was acknowledged as a good defender.) But, the rest of Russell's HOF teammates were very good, to say the least.    Cousey had four 20+ ppg seasons in his career (and another six 18 ppg seasons.) Sharman had three 20+ ppg seasons (and two more 19+ ppg seasons.) Heinsohn had three 20+ ppg seasons in a relatively short nine-year career (and all with Russell BTW.)   Howell was an under-rated player who played with Russell for three years and had 20.0, 19.8, and 19.7 ppg averages in those three years (he also had three other 20+ ppg and two other 19+ ppg seasons in his career.)   Sam Jones played with Russell for 12 years and had 10 rings. He had four 20+ ppg seasons while there (as well as three other 18+ ppg seasons.) Not only that but he one year in which he averaged 25.9 ppg.  And then there was Havlicek. Havlicek played with Russell for seven years and came away with six rings. He played with Boston another nine years and won two more rings. What is interesting, though, is that he had three 20+ ppg seasons (and three 18+ ppg seasons) with Russell. His high seasonal average with Russell was 21.6 ppg. However, after Russell retired,  Hondo had five more 20+ ppg game seasons (and one more 19 ppg), with ALL five of them better than any of his during the Russell era. In fact, he had a 28.9 and a 27.5 ppg season, which are Jerry West-like years.  For those that argue that Russell made his teammates better, Havlicek is an example to the contrary. He was clearly a better player after Russell. Even more interesting, however, is that you have to wonder how those other Celtic players, particularly Sam Jones, would have fared had they played somewhere else?   My point is that most all of them were probably capable of scoring more with other teams in which they would have been the primary focus of the offence. Why is that important?   Because I think it clearly proves that Russell was every bit the beneficiary of great teammates, as they were of playing with him.   The fact was, Russell played with not only talented rosters but usually very deep rosters, as well. Wilt, on the other hand, aside from his years with the Sixers, not only had less talented teammates, he had less quantity, as well."
"Welcome to r/nba. I love when people speak with hindsight 20/202 lens. For what it's worth.  I had: 1. Fultz  2. Josh Jackson 3. Ball  4. Fox 5. Tatum 6. Monk 7. DSJ 8. Og/Bam 9. BAM/Og 10. Don  Don &amp; Bam were close to where I thought they should be but when OG dropped to us at 23, I was shocked (even given his injury concerns). I never understood the hype around Frank because his shooting worried me in what I saw of him online."
Assuming you mean Frank Jackson I agree with this but would swap Sirvydis for Diallo and Sekou for Tyler Cook
"Pistons sports radio said we need to “get Frank Jackson out of town” because he was playing too good and ruining the tank, lmao"
"I saw a lot of trade down options but even those were going to be rough. I saw a lot of a lower pick and Trey Lyes, Frank Kaminsky, Josh Jackson, and Markennen (hind sight this would of been okay).   Signed Lamar Odom..... WHO WAS ON CRACK.   Traded away Jr Smith, Shumpert, and Tyson Chandler for peanuts. We did not get any value in return, only the tank commander Lance Thomas. Tyson went on to have a resurgent year while Jr and shump were key parts to the Cavs championship win.  Drafted Frank: I love and support Frank but after 4 seasons, he’s failed to live up to any expectations. I still think he needs more opportunity as he showed flashes but the general consensus is that he was a bad pick.   Hired Derrick Fisher and Hornacek while forcing them to implement the Triangle offense. I don’t think I need this mess.   Signed Joahkim Noah and Courtney Lee to 4 year deals: Lee was an average role player getting big money and Noah was a corpse of himself. We are still paying Noah....  Ruined Melo’s last years: this is more the organization as a whole but Melo stayed committed to NY but they still failed to bring him any real change of winning after the 2013 season."
"The problem is all the multi year guys are surrounded by OADs and the Duke culture and leave early anyway. Frank Jackson, Trevon Duval, Wendell Carter and most recently DJ Steward are all dudes that were accounted for future teams but left early and left Duke scrambling. And there are a few examples of these players almost every year"
"Coaching seems to be far less consistent overall than typical player success and it's because coaches are typically judged based on their win/loss record and whether they can get their team to the playoffs.   Steph Curry failing to get the Warriors to the playoffs this year is not going to damage anyone's perception of him as a player. He's still considered one of the greats. It could raise questions with Kerr, though. Likewise, if the Lakers get bounced by the Suns, no one is going to doubt LeBron's greatness (well beyond the haters and trolls) but it'll certainly bring into question whether Frank Vogel is the man.   Coaches are way more expendable to a franchise than a player ever will be so, the turnover makes it very difficult to sustain at a level that many would consider great. I think right now, only a handful of coaches, with Pop obviously at the top, get that greatness treatment.  But they're rare. For every Rick Carlisle, you've got a guy like Stan Van Gundy, who a decade ago probably would have been considered one of the best coaches in the NBA but now is struggling after bottoming out with the Pistons and potentially failing with the Pelicans.   I don't envy NBA coaches because it's a profession where you're basically given a four year window to do something to warrant an extension and if that something isn't good enough (and varies based on franchise from just making the playoffs to actually winning a title), you're gone.   Hell, years ago Larry Miller admitted that he would have likely fired Jerry Sloan after the 1990 season had that season happened at the time he gave the quote. He said this because Utah was coming off another first-round loss after blowing a 2-0 lead on Phoenix, a year after the team was swept by the Warriors in the first round during Sloan's first season with Utah.  Coaching is a largely thankless job anyway unless you're a consistently great coach. And even then, people will doubt you. How good has Popovich really been since Duncan retired? Sure, they made the WCF with Leonard...but since? Two first-round exits and then two-straight seasons where they missed the playoffs.   Pop, in my mind, will always be a great. But the dude's recent record certainly isn't turning heads.   And that's the problem with coaching. We expect a player to see diminishing returns the older they get. Coaches? Nope. They're expected to evolve and keep the winning up but rarely can they. Even the great Phil Jackson saw the writing on the wall with the Lakers there at the end, despite still having Kobe, and bowed out.   The coaches who don't, who are less successful overall than Pop or Jackson, a guy like Van Gundy, sometimes don't get to make the decision and it's made for them.   Gundy took Orlando to the finals a bit over a decade ago and certainly would have made the list of best coaches in the NBA heading into the 2010-11 season.   But he would only last two more seasons before being fired. Gundy was/is a good coach but just not good or lucky enough to have a level of success that he could absorb player strife and down years. And now he's coaching New Orleans and likely in a win now situation next year or he'll be unemployed again.   It's a very fickle game that only allows for a very limited amount of coaches to survive long enough where they can consistently make the list of top coaches."
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
Jackson Frank @jackfrank_jjf  Dallas had the 3rd-ranked defensive rating against top-10 offenses this year. Held LAC to 103 points today.
"I respect your opinion but definitely disagree. Sure it would be better for college hoops if A-list players still wanted to play 4 years, but I think the sport is still intriguing and fun to watch even with a couple of the big powers (Duke and Kentucky primarily) being 1&amp;Done factories. I would certainly disagree that the NCAA hasn’t been “relevant” in decades, I’d say as recently as 2019 with Zion the NCAA was immensely relevant. Duke was all over SportsCenter and everywhere else. Plenty of good college teams are still built on the backs of numerous 4-year players. This year’s champ, Baylor, was an absolutely incredible squad that shot over 40% from deep *as a team* and featured 6 upperclassmen among their most prominent ~8 players, and no freshmen. I personally am a Kansas fan and though we’ve sent some 1&amp;Dones to the league (Josh Selby, Xavier Henry, Ben McLemore, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre, Josh Jackson come to mind), most of our actual best players over that time frame have been 3-4 year guys like Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Thomas Robinson, Tyshawn Taylor, Perry Ellis, Devonte’ Graham, and Frank Mason. Idk, it probably helps that I grew up a fan of a blue blood, but I love college hoops. I think if anything, what threatens the quality of the sport long-term is the newly relaxed transfer rules. I also have a hard time knocking them though because the kids deserve flexibility, but that will definitely threaten team continuity more than the 1&amp;Done trend."
"He wasn't good with Detroit? How about Detroit wasn't good with him? Especially with the way the coach told him he has just as good as a shot there then New York. With that attitude no wonder the pistons are doing horrible. Coach needs to pick that team up. Easily was the best PG dare I say player for Detroit in his short time there especially when you look at the PG depth for Detroit and they just have Killian Hayes, Cory Joseph, saben lee and Frank jackson  . Rose has been putting up numbers all besides the Cavs season. But I will agree he's been playing phenomenal with the Knicks. But I'll end this on a note that if you haven't been following rose since the bulls traded him to New York originally then you've been vastly missing out on the Renaissance of a man coming back to form when all seemed to give up on him."
idk if it’s a glitch but whenever I do Jaren Jackson JR to Frank Ntilinka it says no players found
"Frank Jackson, jah and I think maybe a couple more guys but I am not sure who. We won’t be doing much in free agency"
Frank Jackson flair! He’s been a monster for us this season
"yeah, including josh and frank jackson over stewart and hayes is braindead"
"With Hayes , bey and stewy taking the leap next year adding Cade along with our roster currently 30 wins in a 82 game year is a done deal, that’s only 10 more wins. Not to mention bringing back guys like Diallo and Frank Jackson (great addition) who didn’t get PT early this year , this young pistons team will be fighting for a play in game at the minimum. I’m excited about it"
"Delon Wright was traded at the deadline,  the likely starting lineup will be  Hayes Cunningham Bey Grant Stewart   with a mix off the bench of: mason plumlee, saben lee, josh/frank jackson, and a likely late first rounder as the pistons will probably try to trade back up with their 3 seconds"
"I’m not judging the rebuild yet, that’s my point. I don’t think we can take much away from a season where they met their exceedingly low expectations with a bad roster that performed as poorly as expected. If they had exceeded expectations it would be a different story  An unstoppable driving game that’s top 20 in the league? You’d think he could at least score at league average efficiency then. His volume stats went up and his efficiency tanked this year, sounds a lot more like a guy given the green light to shoot on a bad team   Honestly most of those guys just played more minutes and had almost identical /36 numbers. Diallo played most of the season on OKC before being traded and I don’t see why Casey should get credit for his better season. Frank Jackson had a great year and developed well though, I’ll give you that"
"&gt;20 wins each season  This season the entire roster was gutted, there’s only 1 guy from last season still on the team. Judging a rebuild by its record in year 1 is a lousy take.   &gt;Grant seems like the same guy  Bro what is this? Grant developed super nice handles, a middy game, and an unstoppable driving game (top 20 in the league). He’s a completely different player.  Casey helped developed two guys out the lottery into all-rookies, and they’re completely different players now than they were when they were drafted. Killian Hayes looks so much better than he did at the start of the season. He helped Plumlee, Wright, CoJo, Diallo, Frank Jackson have career years. Yea the record ain’t great - but it was a developmental season lol. Casey did a good job, as he both developed the players and helped us fade for Cade successfully."
"The context of the two movies couldn't be more different. Jordan was a cultural god in the 90's in the same stratosphere as Michael Jackson, Babe Ruth, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Sinatra, Elvis, etc. He had a midas touch to endorsements. The whole idea for the movie even came from some tv commercials. Lebron is great in his own right but he looms in a different time."
"I mean… would you guys really make roster decisions based on Diallo, Lee and Frank Jackson lol"
"I think Weaver wouldn’t care too much for picks 23/24 and would rather pick up future picks. Our roster is already at 9 guaranteed spots, plus Cook who will definitely be guaranteed, and then bringing back Hamidou Diallo and Saben Lee, possibly Frank Jackson too. You’d be at 12 roster spots with picks 2, 23, 24, plus three second rounders, which obviously does not work."
Jackson said frank the tank is like who???  Tom Brady wtf?!?!
"Coaches a decade ago, 2010/11 season...   **Former NBA Players**   Larry Drew   Doc Rivers   Larry Brown   Paul Silas   Byron Scott   Rick Carlisle   George Karl   John Kuester   Keith Smart   Rick Adelman   Vinny Del Negro   Phil Jackson   Lionel Hollins   Scott Skiles   Kurt Rambis   Avery Johnson   Monty Williams   Scott Brooks   Doug Collins   Alvin Gentry   Nate McMillan   Paul Westphal   Jerry Sloan   Ty Corbin   Jay Triano   **Non NBA Players**   Thibs   Frank Vogel   Jim Obrien   Erik Spoelstra   SVG   Greg Popovich"
"Weaver  It’s been known he’s got an eye for talent (drafted Westbrook, Harden, Adams, SGA, and more), and in just one season in Detroit he’s got everything turned around to where we actually show promise.   Saddiq and Beef Stew look like steals from last draft. Believed in Jerami Grant and he’s played above his contract. Gave Frank Jackson a chance and he started looking like a potential 6man candidate towards the latter portion of the season. Not even to mention we got the first pick.  I trust him"
Drummond would be more skilled than Hakeem Olajuwon if Frank Vogel would let him.  I would have been a better version of Michael Jordan if Phil Jackson let me as well
"There definitely was more than that. Stewart, Killian Hayes, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee, Hamidou Diallo, and Josh Jackson all showed reasons to be excited."
"Exactly like this. There were a few instances off a pick and roll where Terrance Mann would be Ayton and Reggie Jackson was guarding the rim down below.   I was pulling my hair out yelling at my tv just to throw the ball down the Ayton. I understand no one really posts-up anymore but even if Mann is smothering Ayton, at least throw the pass high and Ayton can hit that 10-15 ft jump shot over the smaller defender.   I’m hoping the Suns address this because if they try to go small and put Saric or Frank in, I just don’t see them keeping up offensively."
Sleeper homer pick Frank Jackson getting paid like 500k lol
"hot take but plum isn't languishing. i actually think it's a good idea to keep him for another year to continue to help stew develop and then look at packages for him.   also, i'd take resigning frank jackson over hami to put more shooters around cade, but ideally i'd love to keep both of em. our bench guard rotation would be scary."
"Way too early for that.  The team has max cap space in 2022. There is no reason to deal your assets right now when they are developing.  Run a lineup of Killian/Cade/Bey/Grant/Stewart with backups of Diallo/Frank Jackson/Plumlee/Sekou, etc.   In a year, go get another big time player and add them to that young core."
"Why would the Pistons do this, they lose 27 year old Jerami Grant for 32 year old Bledsoe, who is a much worse player.  Just to take a flyer on a #10 pick who will be a crapshoot instead of proven commodity like Grant?  And Bledsoe is not cracking the Pistons starting lineup with Cade/Killian and won't even be a top player off their bench with Plumlee, Frank Jackson, Hamadou Diallo all above him...not too mention they need to give time to Sekou and Saben Lee, etc.  This trade makes the Pistons much worse."
DSJ is probably gone I'd bet. Pistons will probably prioritize re-signing Diallo and hopefully sign Frank Jackson and Saben Lee to guaranteed deals as both were on 2-way contracts last season and played very well.
"Jackson, for all his faults, helped set the Warriors on the path to success. Pierce did no such thing. A better analogy is Luke Walton –&gt; Frank Vogel (young ""wonderkind"" coach flames out and gets replaced by an underestimated retread coach)"
Frank “no relation to Reggie” Jackson
Any list without Frank Jackson can’t be taken serious.
DSJ won't be on this team.   Frank Jackson is more of a part of the future.
"I wouldn't be surprised if this was the roster, plus Frank Jackson."
"Don't forget about the Piston's best player, Frank Jackson."
He won us 2 games by himself at one point. I was convinced him and Frank Jackson were going to blow this for us.
"Pistons roster has 2 top ten rookies, another rookie in Killian who looks very promising and a very solid player in Jerami Grant. Not to mention other high potential guys who fly under the radar, Sekou, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee and Hami Diallo. Pistons are in a pretty good start 1 year into the new front office regime."
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner. That said, here's that data:  &amp;#x200B;  |(1) Kevin Huerter|Maryland|139 pts (12 games)| |:-|:-|:-| |(2) Tim Hardaway Jr.|Michigan |119 pts (7 games)| |(T3) Bryn Forbes|Michigan State|92 pts (11 games)| |(T3) Mike Conley|Ohio State|92 pts (6 games)| |(5) Jaren Jackson Jr.|Michigan State|68 pts (5 games)| |(T6) Kendrick Nunn|Illinois|41 pts (4 games)| |(T6) Duncan Robinson|Michigan|41 pts (4 games)| |(8) Romeo Langford|Indiana|36 pts (4 games)| |(9) Alex Len|Maryland|20 pts (5 games)| |(10) E'Twaun Moore|Purdue|11 pts (3 games)| |(11) Frank Kaminsky|Wisconsin|10 pts (6 games)| |(T12) Amir Coffey|Minnesota|5 pts (7 games)| |(T12) Carsen Edwards|Purdue|5 pts (2 games)| |(14) Daniel Oturu|Minnesota|4 pts (5 games)| |(15) Jalen Smith|Maryland|3 pts (3 games)| |(T16) Yogi Ferrell|Indiana|2 pts (6 games)| |(T16) Bruno Fernando|Maryland|2 pts (2 games)| |(T16) Cassius Winston|Michigan State|2 pts (1 game)| |(T16) Xavier Tillman Sr.|Michigan State|2 pts (3 games)| |(20) Trey Burke|Michigan |1 pt (2 games)|"
"Markelle Fultz is not a bust. Dude is an above average player in the league right now. The only reason people don’t know that is because he plays in Orlando, and most people stopped paying attention to him after he got traded.  Josh Jackson(sort of) and DSJ are the two busts from that draft. You could argue Frank Ntilikina too, just because he’s still unplayable in some matchups due to spacing problems."
Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
I really don’t see anywhere he’d be in our rotation. Frank Jackson and Diallo are much better options and will likely be the backup 2 and 3. Wouldn’t be surprised if they traded Josh or if not I guess he’d just fall out of the rotation. He’s not great tbh a lot of us would take a 2nd for him in a heartbeat lol
"&gt; I think most fans on this sub would agree that the players were in the mostly in the right here.  I can't vibe with this. The players made some understandable decisions after the riot had started but prior, not so much.   * Ben Wallace needed to get a grip. It was a dumb foul, it was delivered in a manner to appear unassuming but he knew there was intent behind it, but at some point Ben needed to cool those jets and he didn't, thus keeping an altercation going longer than it needed.   * Jamaal Tinsley's decision to tell Ron Artest, of all people, that he could go ahead and ""get one"" at the end of a 20-point blowout win was a textbook case of why you don't tell your resident team wild card to go out and commit an intentional foul.   * John Green is dumb. He's a dude with a criminal history who somehow thought the right move was to lob a solo cup at a massive NBA player minding his own business. I don't know law too well but I imagine that's a degree of assault (though his jail sentence was for the punches he threw at Artest from behind after Ron attacked the wrong guy, not the cup).   * NBA security was too lax. I'm still confused by the police situation at the Palace because even pre-riot it always seemed like there were plenty of cops out there directing traffic after the game, but one way or another they were absent in a time of need. I think the league was caught sleeping on account of the near unprecedented nature of the event (not accounting for previous isolated incidents involving Vernon Maxwell and Charles Barkley). But there'd been multiple fan-related incidents in other sports the previous years (fans attacking an umpire and first base coach in separate incidents in Chicago, a fan leaping into the penalty box to confront Tie Domi, and pitcher Frank Francisco throwing a chair and breaking a woman's nose just weeks prior), so there should have already been at least a semi-heightened level of alert.  * Ron Artest's decision to storm into the stands was catastrophic and completely ill-advised. He could have chosen literally any other option and we probably aren't talking about this event today. He was undoubtedly provoked, but dude also blew up that entire situation with a bazooka in response. [He ran over his own radio guy and broke his back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONfKrtMCUXc&amp;t=756s&amp;ab_channel=RetroSeasons), grabbed the wrong dude in the stands, and forced his own teammates into off-the-cuff decisions about what to do next (resulting in a range between Stephen Jackson coming in hot tossing haymakers and Fred Jones trying to restore order and getting punched by Ben Wallace's brother from behind instead (Wallace's bro was charged for that).   Jermaine's falcon punch was warranted, in my opinion. Willingly chasing into a crowd of 15,000 to attack one at random is *wayyyyyy* different than fans entering *your* realm and presenting an immediate threat. Artest and O'Neal punching Haddad worked for me.   Otherwise though, a lot of people messed up in a lot of ways in this event, and that includes the players."
"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."
"Tier 1  Thad Young, TJ McConnell, Satoransky, Ingles  Tier 2 Poeltl, Holmes, Kenny Hustle, DFS  Tier 3 Both Currys, Kyrie, Jarrett Allen, Frank Jackson"
"I'm not loving Killian as the main ball handler and playing Cade off ball but he's at least got some juice and will be fun to watch.   D Rose, Wright, Cory Joseph, Frank Jackson, and Josh Jackson does not sound a fun combo of guards to watch.    Respect for watching all those games tho, I can't say I suffered through all the Thunder games during the 2nd half tank job of last season."
"Our backcourt was a mess. Easily the worst backcourt in the league. Revolving door of players. Some Killian, some D Rose, some Delon Wright, some Cory Joseph, some Saben Lee, some Frank Jackson, some Josh Jackson, some Diallo, and even a little McGruder.     If I had to guess, I would say that Wright got the most starts at PG, and Josh Jackson got the most starts at SG. I could totally be wrong, but I watched literally every game, and I'm not sure without looking it up. So, I fault absolutely no one for not being up on all that mess.  Cade solidifies one of the positions, but we're still looking for someone to step up and claim the other guard spot. Beef Stew (or maybe Olynyk) will fill out the C position now that Plumlee was moved."
"1A &amp; 1B are for Cade &amp; Killian. Not for Lee, and not for Joseph.  I just don't see how the team would bench Frank Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Saddiq Bey and others to give ""a lot"" of run to Joseph in 3 guard lineups."
"Bey should approach 40% shooting this year with better looks, better decision making and growth.  Frank Jackson is a 40% shooter.  Olynyk has had ranges in his shooting, but is generally in the 37% range.  Jerami Grant was shooting 39% from 3 in Denver when he didn't have to be the primary ball handler/playmker. He should be able to approach that again if he is not tasked with the offensive playmaking.  Also, you are looking at last year's percentages which included a shit load of tanking and guys like Rose &amp; Griffin who started the year dominating the offense.  Context matters man."
"&gt;and we won't have great shooting.  You can't judge regular season shooting off of Summer League (with guys like Sirvidys &amp; Cook who won't be on the roster) and guys like Saben Lee who are spending most of their team in the G-League.  The Pistons should have excellent shooting from Cade, Frank Jackson, Bey, Grant, Olynyk.   They should also have some average shooting options with Lyles &amp; Garza.  Hamidou Diallo remains a question, because if he can shoot that really rounds out the rotation with shooting at every position."
"And I honestly believe a lot of people posting here literally did not watch the game.  The Pistons rolled out lineups with 3-4 non-shooters around Cade. This won't happen in the regular season when he has Frank Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant &amp; Kelly Olynyk.   A guy like Cade thrives when he has guys around him who can hit shots, and when there is a real system to run.   Summer League fails to provide both of those aspects."
"&gt;Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF  I don't think you will see a ""lot"" of that.  Casey and the front office have stressed how important shooting is this year. For that reason, Frank Jackson &amp; Saddiq Bey will be playing a lot of SG/SF.  Also, if we re-sign Hamidou Diallo (which I expect), there is another guy who will be playing at the SF spot."
Remember when Frank Jackson scored 30 against the Knicks during the earthquake game
"God I miss him at Kansas. One of my all time favorite who should have been known as maybe the best big at KU since Manning and up there with him in achievements. He did everything right. He stayed and worked his ass off to fix his body and perimeter defense and became the best big in the nation. He missed 2 tourneys from wrist injuries on separate wrists, and entered 2020 anchoring the best team(by far imo) in the nation. We made a final four in the only tourney he fully played in. That team the year before with him instead of landen Lucas in the lineup also wins it all and I feel strongly about that. Frank mason, devontae graham, josh Jackson, svi mykhailuk and udoka azubuike. God damn"
Nice! I love Frank Jackson great re-sign
"Bobby Washington, Shelvin Mack, Jack Givens, Frank Kornet and Mel Turpin with a bench of Dirk Minniefield, Vince Taylor and Tony Jackson. We go 0-82"
"I think the pistons have a case. We were number one in bench scoring last year and we added kelly O  Saben, josh jackson, sekou, kelly O  And potentially hami and frank jackson (if we retain them)"
Frank and Knox were the previous FOs (Phil Jackson and Steve Mills) picks. The jury is still out on Obi.
"Cade - 19  Killian - 20  Beef Stew - 20  Sekou - 20  Balsa - 21  Saben Lee - 22  Bey - 22  Garza - 22  Livers - 23  Frank Jackson and Hamidou Diallo are both 23, and likely to be re-signed as well. If we are counting two-way guys Chris Smith is 21."
"The Pistons currently have 6 ACC players: Wayne Ellington, Jerami Grant, Frank Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, and Dennis Smith"
"Pelicans came close with Duke.   (Ingram, Reddick, Okafor, Frank Jackson, and Zion)"

"Between Griffin's dead money opening up and the contracts for Josh Jackson and Jahlil Okafor ending, you still got $35 mil opening up next year. And even if we add a $20 mil player this year and re-sign guys like Frank Jackson and Saban Lee, we would still have $50+ mil left under the luxury tax next year. There's room to make moves with Grant being the highest paid at $20 mil and a whole lot of young players on cheap contracts. If the contracts signed this year become some kind of hindrance there's always ways around it, be it sign and trade or dumping salary like we just did with Plumlee. If a player wants to come, you can make it work. I'm just not a fan of sitting on this ability to make yourself better when you don't know what happens next year. For all you know Beal or whoever could sign an extension and you miss out both this year and next year."
I think he gets mis-cast a lot in terms of what people expect him to be able to do.  [This article](https://theanalyst.com/na/2021/07/lonzo-ball-new-orleans-pelicans-restricted-free-agent/) from Jackson Frank is a great breakdown on Lonzo IMO.
"Our SGs are Josh and Frank Jackson and Diallo (someone is gone if Powell signs), so whomever of those 3 ends up staying could greatly benefit from having Norm to learn from."
"Young guys will play, Grant is your oldest player. And we have to take Frank Jackson and Diallo minutes just to give Mcdermott minutes. We need centers, Stewart will play PF in the future, because he is undersized.  Garza e Balsa will go straight to G-League, they need to develop there   Then we have Okafor,..."
Jackson Frank on Twitter
JE3 wrote on twitter it was to open up space for Stewart and save some money in the process. 1st overall pick gets a pretty big contract.  I'm also guessing Troy wants flexibility since Frank Jackson and Diallo might cost a bit to retain.
"Making sure we can sign Diallo, Frank Jackson, and then use the trade exemption. Or maybe we'll ""Over pay"" another player like we did Jerami Grant last year? Lots of options but we'll find out next week."
"nah mj isn't built like that, none of the no 1 guys back then were like that  that's why you see this whole superteam team hopping shit when legit first options leave happens way more today  anyways you can't claim anything on a hypothetical so your point is moot. Plus MJ made phil jackson the goat coach and we all know players win championships.   nobody out here is calling frank vogel the best coach in the league, all of that depends on the players you get"
Don't forget about Doumbouya being the next Caboclo and both Josh and Frank Jackson playing their best ball of their careers last year either.
"Actually detroit proper has gotten really nice, my friend lives down there and 1,000+ sqft condos are renting at like $3-4K/mth and most of the Lions players live in like Dearborn or Allen Park because of their practice facility. I think Frank Jackson has an apartment downtown."
"Frank Nitty, Joe Johnson, Stephen Jackson, and Cutting Mobley is a real squad"
"Clippers under Ballmer aren't the same as the Clippers under Sterling. Overall the Clippers have put together a top notch organization with Lawrence Frank at the helm. Last year Paul George shit the bed in the playoffs but this year the Clippers looked solid with great role players like Batum and Reggie Jackson playing great basketball before Kawhi went down. Ballmer expects a lot from his team but also doesn't try to micromanage his team. I like to shit on the Clippers as much as any Lakers fan, but as an organization I can't fault anything they have done."
"If by well defined top 4, you mean top 4 prospects, I don’t think that was the case in 2017. People’s opinions on Tatum were all over the place.  3 writers’ had big boards for the Ringer. Tatum was 2nd on KOC’s after Fultz (highest I’ve seen him) followed by Lonzo, Fox, Isaac, Jackson in that order. Both other guys (Chau and Tjarks) had Tatum at 9th lol: Chau’s order was Fultz, Ball, Josh, Isaac, Fox, DSJ, OG, Frank, JT. Tjarks had Fultz, Ball, Isaac, OG, Josh, DSJ, Fox, Monk, JT.  Sports Illustrated’s final big board had him at 5th though they did say he “should be in the mix as high as No. 3 to the Celtics” and had an “elite tier” ordered like Fultz, Fox, Jackson, Lonzo, Tatum. Bleacher Report’s final 1 had him at 6th after Fultz, Ball, JJ, Isaac, Fox.   Even in Nba.com’s mock draft 2 days prior, they had us taking Jackson after Fultz and Lonzo got picked then had Fox going at 4 and Tatum at 5 to the Kings."
Frank Jackson III
"I dont get why you left Frank Jackson off the Pistons, he averaged like 15 a game off the bench. We’re definitely not second last considering we led the entire league in bench points last year"
"Huerter in terms of his role on a championship level team. Where a superstar heliocentric ball handler like Trae Young or James Harden controls majority of your possessions with high pick and rolls and secondary guys like Huerter or Bogi creates some offense with limited usage to either allow the super star a rest or they are feeding off the super star’s usage.   It’s pretty much consensus from the people from the Stepien, DP, and Jackson Frank that only Cade and Green have that potential to be that superstar on a championship team. Suggs would likely top off as that second option."
"It doesn't. Literally the only way to make the salaries match is to include Jerami Grant in the trade. The Pistons can't trade all the free agents they just signed (including Lee, Frank Jackson, and Joseph) until December 15th so in order to make the salaries work without giving up Cunningham they have to trade everyone else they *can* trade: Grant, Hayes, Stewart, Bey, and Josh Jackson for John Wall. Nope."
"lonzo, i hated his ugly ass hair and rat face when he was on the lakers but now he doesnt have that haircut anymore so i dont hate him as much.  here are some players i currently hate:  kelly oubre  kyle kuzma  pj tucker   tyler herro  jalen green    here are some i dislike:  devin booker  anthony davis   shai although i dont want to   danny green  james harden   frank jackson   mpj  kristaps   ben simmons"
"Phil Jackson drafted Frank to be a triangle offense point guard. Jackson was fired shortly thereafter and Frank never ran the triangle. He’s really an off guard which is why he would fit in the triangle but in the NBA today a point guard needs to be able to penetrate and kick out which Frank could never do no matter what team developed him. On top of all that he has a terrible habit of avoiding any kind of scoring opportunity, he has never looked comfortable scoring the ball save for a few rare performances. His lack of aggression on offense is so bad it negates anything he could do defensively."
Frank Jackson?
"Rob Edwards, Frank Jackson, Jordan Clarkson"
"But Tatum was not the best pick available at number 3 by the majority consensus at that time.  Only KOC was all that high on him - actually had him 2nd on his big board - and the other ringers writers joked about it. The other two Ringer draft guide guys both had him 9th behind some order of Fultz, Lonzo, Isaac, Jackson, Fox, DSJ, OG, and one or the other of Monk/Frank.  Sports illustrated projected him going 3rd to the Celtics after we traded down but still had him 6th in its final big board. CBS and the ringer’s mock draft had him 4th and bleacher report had him 6th.  The ringer’s mock draft for 2016 (no big board pre 2018 draft) and nbc had Jaylen going 7th, cbs and bleacher report had him going 8th, and espn had him going 6th. So lower but not by all that much."
"i thought frank ntilikina would be taller, better passing pat bev and josh jackson a better shooting iguodala"
Excuse you but the Bulls are destroying the worst teams in the league! Lonzo completely shut down Frank Jackson.
He also said Frank Jackson was going to take his spot on the Pelicans.   I love Jrue…but thank God he’s not a GM
I love my boys but the Pistons might be the worst offensive team in the league right now. Our three point shooting is horrendous and the only guy making any kind of consistent impact right now is Saddiq Bey. Killian has 2 points across 40 minutes and is without question the worst starting guard in the league at this moment. It’s questionable if he’d even make an impact in the G-League right now. Corey Joseph and Frank Jackson are not much better to round out our guard play. Our defense is solid but Cade is going to have a tremendous amount of pressure to reignite this offense when he finally plays.
"It's against two teams that are not really known for defense. Though I respect Frank Jackson a lot. And Herb Jones was amazing earlier. But as a ""team,"" I don't see the Pistons and Pels  did good defensively  against the Bulls.  Zach real test will come from the Knicks IMO. Raptors(before the Knicks) is good defensively too. But they will likely deal with Vooch first. Since they don't have a traditional big who can defend the post."
"It’s from Jared Dubin on Twitter:   https://twitter.com/jadubin5/status/1451544407216377857?s=21  He and Jackson Frank are good follows for this kinda stuff, same with Steve Jones Jr (if you want live tweet commentary)"
"Bro, he wasn't even the worst player in their starting backcourt last night lol. Frank Jackson is the correct answer to this question"
"I mean, maybe? I just watched Embiid run point pretty effectively last night.  You're arguing a pretty extreme example though. I could roll out ""oh yeah, would replacing Joel Embiid in that 5 center lineup with Frank Jackson actually make that team better?"". But this is a ridiculous thought experiment.  Generally speaking NBA teams focus on talent and figure out fit later. That's how superteams are built, that's how teams draft, that's been the focus of the collective intelligence of the entire NBA for multiple decades now. They all value talent over fit.  But yeah, I'm sure you know better. BuT wHaT iF yOu HaD 5 CeNteRs"
It was a silky smooth 34 pts at literally all levels of scoring except for the three ball. He saw it wasn’t falling and had the awareness to switch it up and impose his will on Frank Jackson.  Scoring at the rim. Scoring at mid range (including some nice turnarounds). Scoring at the line. Clinical transition buckets like a scalpel.  And the best part..had plenty of patience to keep feeding Vuc in the 2 man game to keep the defense on its toes.  He’s at that level already
thats Frank Jackson
"That’s what happens when genius Casey puts our weakest, shortest &amp; worst defender (Frank Jackson) on him all game lmao smh"
"I mean, they completely shut down Frank Jackson"
Frank Jackson is still a dumb player.
Frank Jackson embracing that tank commander role
Frank Jackson looks different every year wtf
"Short answer: everyone is way bigger than you think they're going to be, and besides Klack, pretty much automatic if they had any space at all.  I played Jackson when he was at U of M, you see him on TV and he looks tiny compared to all the other dudes, then you get up next to him and he's 6'3"" and all muscle - the whole team came down to play pickup at the UM rec center (Jackson, Quincy Lewis, Eric Harris, John Thomas \[real a-hole, he was like 6'9"" and 250 of all muscle and taunting the 6'2"" 190 lb guys trying to guard him...\], and Josea Crittendon \[the local walk on scrub\]) - we actually got hot from 3 and beat them, but they were all (thomas notwithstanding) taking it pretty easy . Jackson was obviously the cream of the crop (I had to guard and be guarded by Harris, whom I couldn't get past, but who I was able to keep in front of me \[for those that don't know, he was their defensive stopper...not that they were sticking him on me, it just worked out that way\], but was more in passing mode than attacking.  Webster was just a lights out shooter and at least 3 inches taller than everyone guarding him so could get his shot off whenever he wanted. He wasn't terribly mobile or doing much off the dribble (not as much spacing with a college 3-pt line and a bunch of rec center chuckers on your team), but he didn't need to, when he got the ball is was maybe a fake or two and then swish. It's a bummer he couldn't stay on the floor as a pro, but I think his knees went bad early in his career (or maybe his back?).  Clack was just big...not terribly skilled, but was just physically overpowering and no one could slow him down. Frank Johnson was an assassin...give him any space and he was automatic from everywhere, get too close and he'd go around you and score or find the open man.  He was the least impressive physically (someone had to tell me who he was, I had no idea he was a pro, but when you see the other guys your first thought would be these guys are professional athletes of some sort \[Clack could have been in the NFL...\]), and not fancy at all, but the most skilled of the bunch - of course the other guys were all super young in comparison."
"Played pickup with a bunch of lower-level dudes (Bobby Jackson, Martel Webster, Kris Clack…), but the only one I ever really chatted with was Frank Johnson (wizards and later the suns i think). He was older and out of the league playing pickup at a park in Mpls (still killing everyone at 40+ btw), chatted with him afterward and he was somewhat intense, like “I’m in b-ball mode right now”, but also super nice and supportive."
"well first the grizzlies were far ahead last year.  Pelicans and Kings finished 7 games behind so even getting a bit worse, they can still be tiers ahead of the trio you listed.     grizzlies depth is all solid, that gets underrated during the regular season.  morant/brooks/anderson/jackson/adams and jones/melton/bane/clarke/tillman off the bench.  All guys who have shown recently they are good NBA players and that with a defense ranked 6th last year can get you to .500.  None of the other 3 teams you listed should be even average on defense next year.  Add on they still have plenty of upside since most of their guys are young.  The timberwolves do have their big 3 but not a very solid rotation.  Prince has been a negative the past couple years and they're banking on some young guys in mcdaniels and vanderbilt to develop.  PF is just a problem position for them.  That's just not on the grizzlies level depth wise.  They like the other 2 teams will be better on offense than the grizzlies for sure but not enough to make up the gap on defense imo.  Fox is better than morant absolutely. their defense and depth is still crap, all they added of significance was mitchell who's a rookie, you cant be sure he'll make a huge impact.  Bagley is going be liability and still going get significant minutes.  Once you get the past the top 7(and i'm including bagley and mitchell), there's not much there.  Pelicans I wont talk about as much since that's your team.  however just the fact that you expect a lot of contribution from NAW and Trey Murphy who are not proven good NBA players yet means your depth doesnt compare to the Grizzlies'.  Also to be frank, you were 22nd on defense last year and downgraded going from adams/ball to jonas/devontae.  Hart if he starts is the only above average defender in the lineup.  You could definitely have a top 10 offense but your defense is more than suspect on paper."
"He only planned to coach for 3 years from day 1. When the 3 years was up he stuck to his word. He has a theory that unless you have a Popovic, Phil Jackson, etc. for a coach then a team becomes stagnant if the coach stays too long. It’s why he let Frank Vogel go."
Frank Jackson looks exactly like Frank Jackson
Frank Jackson looks like Keegan Michael Key
I'm sick of Frank Jackson
Frank Jackson looks like an undercover cop playing basketball as his cover
Frank Jackson.
frank jackson looks like a generic 2k player from one of those 1950s teams
Frank Jackson is lit
Frank Jackson
Frank Jackson looks like an 80s pornstar
Frank Jackson too.
Is Frank Jackson rocking a traditional mustachio?? That shit's cocky af
"Predictable 4th quarter collapse, Cade looked awful, not really much to praise here from Detroit’s side. Frank Jackson looks like he’s putting things together again at least"
He can even rock that Frank Jackson stache
"The Pistons running their offense against AD time and time again is the reason we lost. Casey sending FRANK JACKSON to cut into the paint vs Westbrook and AD was a terrible design. Having Cade try to beat AD twice and not set something up to use his strengths was mind boggling. Casey letting Lyles shoot as much as he does is crazy in my eyes. Dwayne Casey may not be a bad coach but he certainly isn't a good one. Our defense played as good as it be could really, but our offense was worse than a pick up game."

Hahaha frank jackson made it look easy.
Frank Jackson looks like an 80s porn star
Frank Jackson swatted that? No way.
"That Frank Jackson moustache is beautiful, should be in a museum."
Frank Jackson looks like a dude from the 80s
The Warriors let Frank Jackson drop that much on them
"Hayes is a way, way better defender than Frank Jackson. All Jackson has on Hayes is his shooting ability, which isn't that useful when he would be at best the fourth choice scoring option if he is in the starting lineup with Grant, Cunningham, and Bey."
"Is he really any worse than Killian Hayes?  Either way, playing either of these guys as a starter is hoping they can develop into players who can legitimately call themselves starters on a competitive team some day, and Hayes 34% career FG % makes him a significant part of the Pistons Offense woes. You can't shoot 34% in the NBA and be anything other than a 15th man. There is at least a partial answer in Frank Jackson, with 43% career shooting. Frank is only 23, he can still develop.   This isn't to say the Pistons don't need someone better than these two, but right now Frank Jackson &gt; Killian Hayes."
Frank Jackson.  Should let him start instead of Killian Hayes.  He shoots quite a bit better it seems like.
Pistons should find a way to start Frank Jackson with how lights out his shooting has been.
Frank Jackson was easily our best offensive player last night and he was a anti-magnet rim away from it going in. If I were dwane I wouldn’t lose sleep over it
"How's it gonna happen with us? What young player are we not playing?  Our young 20 year old center just got injured, we've been giving Trey Lyles his minutes  23 year old Frank Jackson is pretty much our 6th man now that Olynyk is out  Killians been having hand pain, if you saw last night he was holding his hand a lot.    Cade has the most usage out of anyone on the team and is given the greenlight, I just wish he was given chance to shoot the last 3"
"In fairness, Frank Jackson was absolutely scorching…no way that game is that close without him"

I’ll always like Kanter for that too. LeBron was a huge dickhead in that situation. I get that he had issues with Phil Jackson but publicly tearing down a 19 year old that Jackson drafted to get to him is a massive dick move. Frank brought none of that on himself
More like Chiozza -&gt; Poole -&gt; Steph -&gt; Frank Jackson
"bc we got fucking mauled, Frank Jackson got hit multiple times. Poole fouled Cunningham after getting stripped.  Wiggins get every fucking call, was absolutely awful, watching fucking Trey Lyles doing the same thing Wiggins did in the next possession and don't get the call was infuriating.  Box score without watching the game ain't"
"It was a good game.  Refs giving Wiggins and Warriors every call was terrible to watch, completely one-sided referring today.  That last shot by Frank Jackson was cruel."
"JP/Steph conundrum, too many cooks in the kitchen when they both play, not enough touches for Steph, JP and Dray, which makes it harder for both Steph and JP to get in rhythm, since Dray tends to direct the offense, and will priotizie getting Steph going (unless Kerr gamelans to get JP going early), no Steph means lots of touches/the ball in JP’s hands a lot more allowing him too get into rhythm (he also seems somewhat intimidated starting with Steph and Dray)  Chiozza’s a BUM, literal human victory cigar, shouldn’t get meaningful minutes ever  Cade looks like he’s mostly struggling with speed of the game atm, especially when shooting (also strength issues with the shot), the windows close a lot faster at the NBA level, but everything else is as advertised, great passer, high BBIQ, solid handle, runs PnR well, better than advertised D,   DET did not demonstrate high BBIQ outside of Cade in the 1st half, they miss a lot of open looks in favor of passing around the perimeter, got better in the 2nd half  Not a fan of the Hayes/Cunningham backcourt, split their minutes as much as possible to maximize they’re potential growth (although I’m not a big of Hayes)  Small sample size but the G-League seems to prepare guys better NBA game speed than college ball,   Frank Jackson, another random bench player having a career game against the Warriors, at this point all you can do is laugh  End of the game was a ref fuckfest (DET shot 15 free throws in the 4th), mixed with awful crunchtime execution by both teams"
Frank Jackson has a quality mustache
Is frank jackson evil jordan Poole or is Jordan Poole evil frank Jackson?
Frank Jackson looks like Jordan Poole’s dad
Frank Jackson is clearly their best player
Who the fuck is Frank Jackson? Dude looks like Hingle McCringleberry out there and just crushing it right now.
Literally 🤣like does Frank Jackson get 36 minutes a game then
"If we are winning games: Casey sucks we should be building our rotations around getting a 23 year old g league player as the 9th man and tanking  If we are losing games: Casey sucks he needs to make adjustments and run pick and rolls better, why are we playing Frank Jackson he sucks"
"More impressive considering at one point in this game, he was out there with Luka Garza, Frank Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Josh Jackson. None of those guys should be in a 9 man NBA rotation."
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
Holy shit I didn't even recognize Frank Jackson with that mustache lmao
But  no one will ask for the Frank Jackson block on Mobley 😔
frank jackson looks 45 with that stache
We havent been playing Hami who i guess hasnt been performing in practice.  Unfortunate if true cause i love hami and would easily play him over Cory Joseph and Frank Jackson off the bench
Frank Jackson looks old ass hell with that mustache
"Search threads on Dennis Smith Jr, Josh Jackson and Frank Ntkilina"
"Jackson Frank, he's so fucking good."
"Might be Jackson Frank, he gives a lot of praise to many individual players throughout the league."
"A rookie coming off one of the longest basketball-less stretches of his life starts off cold playing with Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Frank the Tank 3.0? BUST, I TELL YOU, BUST!"
Frank Jackson got lucky as hell not to get a tech.
"Pick 4 for pick 8 and 17 was literally never a bad trade. There was no consensus top 4 in that draft, it was Zion, Ja, RJ then who ever else. Some said Garland, some hunter, some culver, etc etc. We had literally zero young talent on the roster outside of the lakers guys at the time. Frank Jackson was like the only draft pick we had on the roster."
"I think the Pistons coaching staff are putting Xanax in the Gatorade. Even guys like Bey, Olynyk, and Frank Jackson are ice cold after being very good from deep last season"
I like how we run plays for Frank Jackson and Josh Jackson but not Cade.
Even one of the Sixers writers I follow is SUPER high on him. He knows a lot about college players so its high praise. Jackson Frank is his name.
"I always think that you need to evaluate a pick relative to the players who could have been picked in that spot. There's always going to be someone better taken way deeper in the draft, but the point is usually that NOBODY saw that guy coming.  Most of the time teams are, in practice, choosing between 3-5 players. So the question is, was the guy taken better than the next 3-5 guys taken?  So with Kendall Marshall, both John Henson and Mo Harkless had better careers, and they were the next two picks. That makes it a clear bad pick. (IN fact, four of the next five picks had better careers. Oof.)  On the other hand, Alex Len - you look at the next few picks, and they're not clearly better than Alex Len by a large margin until you get to CJ McColumn. So you say he wasn't worthy of the #5 pick but that's actually fairly typical return for a #5 pick: solid rotation guy, nothing special. So that's not a bad pick.   TJ Warren went two picks ahead of Nurkic, but was better than the other guys around there. Solid pick.  Devin Booker was picked ahead of a bunch of other decent players, which makes that pick look ever better. Lots of plausible picks and they got the best one!  Dragan Bender, OTOH, is an awful pick. The guys taken after him (Dunn, Hield, Murray, Chriss, Poetl) are all better.   And Josh Jackson is more borderline than I think you're giving them credit for. D'Aaron Fox, Johnathan Issac, Lauri Markinnen, Frank Nkitolina, Dennis Smith, Jr? Josh is neither the best nor the worst of those players. Going to the G-league as a rookie isn't a bit deal for a young guy. He look to have the makings of a serviceable backup big.  2018 obviously they should have taken Luka.   2019 since they must have drafted for the trade, hard to evaluate based on thee quality of the player.   And with Smith they could have had Haliburton ... and now they declined his option? Wow. Yeah. Huge mistake.  So there are a couple of howlers there, but also some of those picks aren't as bad as they look."
"Do any Pistons fans hate the way Dwayne Casey deals with rotations in these less than competitive games? I would rather see the actual important potential franchise cornerstone players get 30+ minutes, even in blowouts, and have a shot at building more chemistry than muck about with minutes for guys like Rodney McGruder, Trey Lyles, and Frank Jackson."
Frank Jackson looks like and sounds like some dude that would have played in the NBA in the 80’s.
