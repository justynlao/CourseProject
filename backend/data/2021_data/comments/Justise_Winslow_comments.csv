I agree with you and that's what we are hoping Justise Winslow (if he actually exists) can be.
Memphis is an easy team to root for.  Also they're extremely loaded in backcourt depth it's kind of bonkers.  PG: Ja / Tyus Jones  SG: Dillon Brooks / DeAnthony Melton / Grayson Allen  SF: Kyle Anderson / Desmond Bane / John Konchar  They basically have so many shooting guards that they're slotting the bigger ones in the wing slot. And remember they still have Justise Winslow.  I could see them consolidating their depth for another good wing in the future.
"Damn I just realized we are missing JJJ, Justise Winslow, Jonas Valunciunas, and Jrayson Allen.  If we keep playing like this, I'm not sure I want them back..."
"The one left out, John “Jitty” Konchar, had some absurd highlights while the game was still at stake too. He had an absolutely beautiful block, a feisty dunk, and he basically only produces good minutes when he gets the chance.  The Grizz are playing really good team basketball, as expected by a team coached by a Pop/Bud acolyte who actually knows what he’s doing. The bench is the most devastating part though, Ja aside. There are so many crazy dangerous dudes on that bench, and they work so cohesively, not to mention the guys like Justise Winslow, Jontay Porter, and Killian Tillie, who haven’t played a minute for the team yet. Obviously Justise is a bigger deal than the other two, who were UDFA darlings, and the idea of Justise Winslow fits so well with what the Grizzlies are trying to do. Anything positive this year is gravy, and there’s so much to like about the future potential of this squad that didn’t stockpile picks or spend half a decade tanking to get here"
"Neither Jaren Jackson Jr nor Justise Winslow have played yet this season. Both Ja and Jonas Valanciunas missed 3 games of the 7 game winning streak. And of course they've been without young, end-of-bench players like Killian Tillie and Jontay Porter for the entire season."

"We have two wins against Brooklyn and one win against the sixers, I’d hardly call that “a bunch of” seeing as the first game against Brooklyn is when Ja got hurt and we’ve been missing JJJ and Justise Winslow the entire season. You can play the “Grizz not beating full strength teams” game but we haven’t been at full strength for a single game this season and we’re still fifth in the west"
"I can’t tell you how much these wins mean for this team and its fans. The Spurs for years have been Grizz killers, and finally we’ve begun to figure them out. But they spoil Ja’s career high 44 points in our season opener, which started off our season sour and we began 2-6. We took a five game winning streak into a two week park. Then we got SAS twice in a row to see if we got rest or got rust. Short-handed.  Injuries for Grizz: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valanciunas, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Jontay Porter, Killian Tillie, Sean McDermott  Spurs: None  First game: Grizz W by 17  Second game: Grizz W by fuckin’ 31  Grizz Next Gen, YOU HEAR ME?!?"
&gt; Done talking with someone who has no idea about anything basketball related.  Then what are you doing replying?   Nothing you've said disproves what I said. Ainge is a fucking pussy.  He also nearly torpedoed his whole rebuild trying to get Justise Winslow.
Yeah imma need more than dieng and fuckin Justise winslow and some picks to give up a 30+ ppg scorer. You are massively underselling beals value.
I was so sure we’re would draft him.  Just like I was sure we had Donovan Mitchell but we got Luke Kennard.  And I was sure we were taking Devin Booker or Justise Winslow but we took Stanley Johnson.  Sacramento got a steal like he did in this clip
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
Is Justise Winslow ever coming back? I guess hip injuries are rough (look at IT) - it's been over half a year.
"I think the way NBA Draft Day trades work that would have been difficult.   Trades don’t happen that instant because it all happens in the old league year so that’s why you see Players wearing the hats of the wrong team even after they’re traded.   I assume as ugly as it would have been that Boston backs out of the deal before it’s officially finalized if Philly lies about Fultz and drafts Tatum.   Though if Micheal Jordan didn’t want Frank Kaminsky or Pat Riley didn’t want Justise Winslow then either the Hornets or Heat would have been in position to draft Tatum, Fultz, Ball, Fox, Etc  instead.   Danny Ainge desperately wanted Winslow in 2015 and was reported to have offered up the Nets picks in exchange but Jordan wanted Kaminsky and Riley wanted Winslow.   Nobody could have foreseen Sean Marks getting hired in Feb 2016 and tearing down the entire Roster for a Rebuild with barely any draft capital."
"He has more value as a help defender.  Honestly, almost wish he didn't win DPOY so we wouldn't have all this discussion of him ""proving himself on defense"" by taking on a stopper role.  I do think with Kyrie back he may have to take KD some.  He actually can do well on KD, mainly because him and KD are more comparable in size.    Back when he was younger and a wing, he spent more time on actual wings did more stopper.    He has randomly spent time on wings in big lineups before - once when Heat relied on Justise Winslow as a playmaker, Giannis went on him and shut him down in a Bucks comeback win."
"Grizzlies have been real quiet about all health stuff, but based on the surgery he got most people estimate between the very end of January, and the middle of February hopefully at the latest. Justise Winslow is supposedly coming back before that even, but again the Grizzlies FO is super tight lipped so nothing really confirmed."
"Exactly. It's also the same mentality that leads them to overpay to keep some of those young guys and that never pan out to the unrealistic expectations they have for them at times. Guys like Tyler Johnson, Justise Winslow, Gary Harris, Otto Porter (harsh?), etc. Never really bad players, but guys that they could've moved on sooner when they had more value to get back more productive players. I think Herro especially will fall into that category at some point."
Justise Winslow
For players all currently in the league I can think of   Jrue Holiday  Justise Winslow  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid
Justise Winslow was traded last year. Had not played in a while and I dont think has played for Memphis yet.
I refuse to get off the Justise Winslow bandwagon. Dude just needs to stay healthy (super simple right?)
i wonder whatever happened to justise winslow sometimes
Yeah I was thinking about Nance but id be surprised if they wanted to move him. Is justise Winslow alive?
Rich man's Justise Winslow
Stanley Johnson and Justise Winslow look a lot more athletic coming into the league than they actually are
"I’m just a fan of girthy thicc muscular jacked chad like Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Semi Ojeleye, Admiral Schofield"
"Justise Winslow is under a club option because he was on the Heat (big surprise there) and so he's in that gray area where he's safe from being selected because if the team doesn't pick up his club option, he's a free agent so he's safe either way"
Aaron Gordon Justise Winslow Jordan Bell
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Exum - Plays on the Cavs; Jazz traded him for Jordan Clarkson. Rotation player at best.  Jahlil - Third stringer on the Pistons; only good in very situational matchups. Could be out of the league soon.  Mudiay - Currently not playing in the NBA. Struggled in Utah although I think Utah should've kept him because they really don't have a backup point guard right now.  Stanley Johnson - Somehow got a player option on the Raptors; good wing defender but zero offensive presence. Raptors may need a guy with a skillset like him or he could be out of the league.  Justise Winslow - Has been injured for what seems like a year now on the Grizzlies. Hopefully he'll get a chance in their starting lineup but he's starting to look like a bust.  Dragan Bender - Bust, out of the league  Kriss Dunn - Third stringer on the Hawks now. Injured, but may see time for his defensive skills.  Thon Maker - Third stringer on the Cavs, may be out of the league soon.  Skal - Out of the league currently, wish somebody would give him a chance as a rotation center though.  Josh Jackson - Had a small resurgence in Memphis but signed with Detroit I believe. Could continue to develop as a rotation wing there.  TJ Leaf - Got salary dumped to OKC and then waived. Good riddance.  Okay I'm done."
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah’s bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson’s doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
"Michael Beasley- Thought he'd be Melo 2.0  Derrick Williams- Thought he'd be a 20 ppg highlight machine  Justise Winslow- I'm still on Winslow island, but I thought he'd be Draymond light by now  and the one i'm most ashamed of was Jahlil Okafor, after watching one to many ball is life mixtapes of him dominating 6'7 highschoolers and LeBron leaving I was down with Tank to the Floor for Okafor  Bonus reel is Hassan Whiteside convincing me he was Wilt reincarnate after a half a season"
**Cries but nods** Justise Winslow 😔
"I sold my land on Justise Winslow Court last year. My current investment portfolio of Fultz, Marquese Chriss, and Dennis Smith Jr. is a mixed bag right now."
"Jaren Jackson Jr. is also out. That's the Grizzlies top 2 players. Justise Winslow is expected to start for them, I think, and he's out too. Not to mention they're missing so many bench players that they were recently granted a ""hardship exception"" to allow them to sign another warm body."
"He could have traded Jaylen Brown's pick, Jayson Tatum's Pick and 2 other picks for Justise Winslow, Goddamnit DANNY!!!!!"
"I'm still amazed any time I hear people say that the Iguodala/Winslow trade was a good one for Memphis. Brian Windhorst the other day was talking about what a good move that was for Memphis because they stuck to their guns and didn't buy Iguodala out. It's like, OK, sure, but they traded him for a massive amount of shitty salaries (Waiters and Dieng), a bunch of which they immediately bought out. So rather than buying out Iguodala's one year and $18 million contract they instead bought out two years and $25 million of Dion Waiters, and somehow it's all worth it because they got Justise Winslow who hasn't played in an NBA game in a full year?"
Justise Winslow is pretty low.
Justise Winslow
It's not Winslow with Justise it's Winshigh
danny loves his athletic wings who can develop a good shot and learn how to handle/distribute the ball (think Paul george). He went after jaylen and reportedly loved justise winslow too
"Let's revisit this comment in 12 months time to see if they truly aren't going in the right direction anymore, personally I think that's premature to say that, even if they have unquestionably regressed since last season.   They have this massive trade exception that they have to use at some point, I'm very curious to see whom Danny uses it on.   RemindMe! 12 months   How has Danny's white whale Justise Winslow looked so far?"
So his father is Justise Winslow?
"Richaun holmes, josh richardson, justise winslow"
Maybe he should trade 5 frps for justise winslow
Would you feel the same way about Ainge if Michael Jordan wasn’t too stupid to let Ainge torpedo the Celtics by trading 4 first round picks to move up and take Justise Winslow?

It didnt happen but iirc we offered 4 firsts to move up in the draft to draft Justise Winslow
[Justise Winslow is active and available tonight!](https://mobile.twitter.com/GrizzliesPR/status/1363283642991149056)
Stanley Johnson vs Justise Winslow was supposed to be the next great rivalry.
"Too early to tell, wait and see what Justise Winslow is before you judge that trade."
The player they took on that money for was Justise Winslow.
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"I downvoted him because he said some ignorant ass shit. He could've just said ""because Green is half Filipino"", but he thought it was necessary to talk shit about Filipinos. The Justise Winslow comparison doesn't make sense either."
"Grizzlies for Justise Winslow and Dillon Brooks. Getting rid of Brooks frees up more playing time for Bane. Winslow is a depreciating asset that probably wouldn't even find rotation time there.   Drummond can slip into that frontcourt rotation alongside JV, Clarke, Tillman and Dieng. They basically all average around 20-30 minutes each so they can shave off a few minutes from each other and give themselves a serious frontcourt nightmare for opposing teams that's extremely versatile and unpredictable in terms of permutations that you'd be facing."
Grizzlies Injury Report  Jaren Jackson Jr OUT  Brandon Clarke OUT  De'Anthony Melton OUT  Justise Winslow OUT  Desmond Bane OUT  Lovely.
"And the Grizzlies are without Jaren Jackson Jr and Justise Winslow? Tonight we also didn’t have Deanthony Melton or Brandon Clarke, super important Rotation players"
"I know, wait until I tell you Justise Winslow plays for the Grizzlies"
Justise Winslow: out (thigh).
"Justise Winslow, not as bad as it used to be."
Justise Winslow
Maybe.  They need to find a team willing to trade a quality pick first.  Pretty rare to see a team with a good pick trade for a bunch of significantly lower ones.  Remember when MJ didn't accept Ainge's offer of 4 FRPs to trade up from 16 to 9 to draft Justise Winslow.
Justise Winslow &amp; Jalen Brunson
"&gt;Bucks with Giannis  Giannis was predicted as worthy of the risk/reward as a draft pick around the 15 range and sure enough Bucks were picking in that range. If they had the 5th pick in that draft and ""reached"" to pick him I would give them a ton of credit for that but he kinda just fell into their lap. Same thing with Devin Booker on the Suns. He was seen as a pick in the 15 range and he was picked right around there. If Suns had the 8th pick in the draft for example I suspect they would have picked Stanley Johnson or Justise Winslow like anyone else. How much of these great picks (and btw I am not saying Devin Booker was as great of a pick as Giannis, not even close) are just the prospect falling into their lap and how much of it is having better scouting than your rivals?"
I was thinking he could return in a similar capacity to a Justise Winslow sort of player- mainly role player with a little bit of scoring. He had the athleticism
Justise Winslow.
Justise Winslow
Is that the guy who offered 4 1st round picks for Justise Winslow?
"The Grizzlies VP said he’s going to be “out a minute” on [November 19th] (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30347396/memphis-grizzlies-forwards-jaren-jackson-jr-justise-winslow-miss-start-season), and the beat writers said he might be back on MLK day.      This is getting to the point where you have to wonder if he’s had a setback."
"Remember when we would argue who was going to have the better career, Stanley or Justise Winslow?  Ah, those were the days."
"Justise Winslow.   Dude can’t stay on the court, but shows flashes here and there."
Justise Winslow.
"Yeah they’re the deepest team imo. They have 7 pretty good players off the bench.   Tyus Jones is one of the best backup PGs in the league.   DeAnthony Melton is probably one of the best defensive guards in the league, add in his secondary playmaking and much improved shooting, and he should be starting.   Justise Winslow is struggling offensively but he is great defensively. Very versatile too.   Desmond Bane is the best shooter in the rookie class. He’s a good defender and secondary ball handler as well. Awesome player.   Brandon Clarke was first team all rookie last year. He’s a monster rim runner with excellent touch and great defense.   JJJ might be the best player on the Grizzlies once he’s healthy.   Xavier Tillman is another excellent rookie, he’s impossible to score on in the paint, he’s a great passer, and the shooting is better than expected.   That’s crazy"
"You're missing the Grizzlies, honestly.  They have a star point guard and very capable back-up PG in Morant and Tyus Jones.  As an OKC-Jazz fan, I envy their options at SG: two-way menace Dillon Brooks, sharpshooter Grayson Allen, advanced stats darling and defensive ace DeAnthony Melton, flamethrower-type of shooter Desmond Bane and John Konchar who is a lot better than people realize since he's buried down the depth chart (he could be a reliable regular back-up on some teams).  At small forward, they have options due to Justise Winslow (who's in a slump) and Kyle Anderson. But this is the only position where they could use more strength, even though Brooks, Konchar and Bane could play the position in a small-ball lineup.  Big man/PF rotation is something to envy: one of the most underrated centers in Valanciunas, potential star JJJ, Tillman, Clarke, even Jontay Porter is somewhat interesting as a prospect (would looove to have him on Jazz or OKC).  Honestly, hats off to their GM."
"For real...stuck in 8th-11th seed purgatory with Justise Winslow, JRich (who I still love but I think we all know he can never be ""the guy""), Tyler Johnson, and Whiteside SUCKED.  Thankfully a true work horse like Butler came and helped unlock Bam's potential &amp; help other guys out too.  The chip last year would have been amazing (no shit) but it was a fun year overall so I wouldn't replace it."
"As a Heat fan I hate it,  You really became one of our fun rivals and it was fun that both our teams somehow found ways in these recent years to have success without being reliant on having a great top 10 pick (sorry Justise Winslow) coming in to bail us out.  I know you guys will rebound somehow! It's the Pacer way!"
Or a chance for Justise Winslow? 😂
For some reason coach has this infatuation with Justise Winslow when everyone else knows he’s absolute trash. Once they bench him it’s over for the league.
Yes they are that good. Jaren Jackson jr hasn’t played a minute until last week this season and they’re sitting pretty above .500. That’s unfathomable. So yea maybe there have been some growing pains since he’s gotten back but and for some reason coach has this infatuation with justise winslow but hopefully next game he’ll figure out how much he sucks and they’ll start clicking. 10-2 totally within the realm of possibilities and have every reason to expect it when you considers what they already accomplished without JJJ.
Can I interest you in a lightly used Justise Winslow
They were playing Justise Winslow at the 5 by the end of that 2nd round series
Bradley Beal is who I thought Ben McLemore would be. I had higher expectations for Nerlens Noel too and Justise Winslow
Ben Simmons is just a healthy Justise Winslow.
You could build quite the house with the number of bricks Justise Winslow put up during his Nuggets workout.
"media has gotten increasingly annoying in the last 2 years or so, but really in the pandemic  What I learned through the pandemic is that none of the analysts watch the games.  Here's one thread I always refer to. The jump crew clowns Justise Winslow for wanting to start at PG for the miami heat, not knowing he started at PG for the heat for 30 games last year.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/d5cgjl/espn_experts_bewildered_by_winslow_wanting_to/  People should just turn off NBA media/ Sports Hot Take media for the most part, its not good nor is it entertaining."
*Justise Winslow
"""Jabari Parker""  ""Justise Winslow""  ""Jahlil Okafor""  oh man"
"Grizzlies don't have a 3 level scoring guard like CJ. Something like Slowmo, Grayson Allen/ Melton, and Justise Winslow might be it. Blazers get deeper, more versatile and better defensively."
I thought Justise Winslow was going to be the next Kawhi Leonard lol
"Literally only because every big besides UD, washed Amare Stoudemire was hurt in that series for us and Toronto. So Biyombo went nuclear vs rookie Justise Winslow who started at the 5 in game 7"
Justise Winslow is gorgeous
"It’s not tho. Porzingis was the best option the Knicks honestly could’ve gotten at the 4th pick. The picks after Porzingis were, in order, Mario hezonja, willie cauley stein, Emmanuel mudiay, Stanley johnson, frank kaminsky, and Justise Winslow. Porzingis, despite his problems, is still a significantly better player than all of those players. For it to be a cautionary tale, it has to be a bad pick or something the team regrets. I guarantee you the Knicks do not regret drafting Porzingis over someone like Emmanuel mudiay. Honestly this draft actually disproves your point. Jahlil okafor is the typical “big man” with typical “big man skills” contrary to Porzingis. However, jahlil okafor turned out to be way worse than Porzingis. A better point would honestly be that it’s a cautionary tale to not take typical big man over unicorn big men"
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
Justise Winslow died for this
FREE JUSTISE WINSLOW!!
"&gt;	The negative reaction from Knicks fans at Barclays Center had to do in part with their lack of familiarity with Porzingis, who played in Spain. After the Timberwolves did as expected and selected Kentucky big man Karl-Anthony Towns with the first overall pick, the Lakers took Ohio State guard D’Angelo Russell before the Sixers snagged Duke forward Jahlil Okafor.  &gt;Watching Okafor taken with the third choice irritated Knicks fans. The selection of Porzingis felt like pouring salt in the wounds, especially with Duke forward Justise Winslow and guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who played in China last season, still available.  https://nypost.com/2015/06/25/why-knicks-fans-at-draft-were-so-upset-with-porzingis-pick/"
"Just realized Justise Winslow is no longer on the Heat. Damn, is he considered a bust then?"
1. JJJ getting his second foul of the first quarter  2. Ja landing awkwardly  3. Justise Winslow
"Other random question for Memphis fans - is Justise Winslow just too rusty to be part of the playoff rotation? / Are you hopeful he'll play a role in the future? I just remember him being a promising player, easy to root for"
Is it fair to call Justise Winslow a bust at this point in his career?
TIL Justise Winslow is on Memphis
Imagine taking Justise Winslow
What’s up with Justise Winslow? Does he not play anymore?
JUSTISE WINSLOW
Once again the grizzlies are ignored and disrespected.  Justise Winslow has been worse than anybody on this list.  🤣
"Our only expiring is justise winslow, and he has a team option I wouldn't be surprised if we picked up, whether to attempt a trade or to give him another season to learn how to play offense or show elite defensive chops"
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"Memphis fact: Big reason we don’t already have 8 locked up is because we decided to try point Justise Winslow over and over and over, as he posted the worst +\- of the team"
"Ever since LeBron left, the only obvious tank job the HEAT did that I vividly remember was in their [final game during the 2014-2015 season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201504150PHI.html), en route to a 37-45 record and...   a win. This was directly after Lebron left and Bosh's first blood clot. They had the 10th pick and got Justise Winslow. The next season, they went into Game 7 of the EC 2nd round while fielding a starting lineup of Dragic - Wade - Iso Joe - Deng - Winslow.   This franchise will fight hard to even just get to the 8th seed and compete. Retool, not rebuild; get spanked, but never tank!"

A G League game + the corpse of Justise Winslow.
"&gt;If the Lakers genuinely believed he was a decent role player on a decent contract, then why in the world would they be looking to trade him?  To improve the team?   It's not like Kuzma is expected to be star or anything like that with that salary. Let's look at the other players in the same range. Justise Winslow 13M, Kennard 12.7M, Cory Joseph 12.6M, Terence Ross 12.5M. Even if you think that Kyle Kuzma isn't as good as some of these players, he's not far off.   Plus, it's a 2+1 deal. So, an expiring contract after 1 season. it wouldn't be dead weight on your cap space either."
I had fellow heat fans telling me they'd still have taken Justise Winslow over Devin Booker as recently as 2019. Homers be crazy.
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
"Yeah it's kind of similar to Devin Booker coming into the draft with how people were too focused on the fact that they weren't lengthy superathletes like other wings in their draft (Justise Winslow, Cam Reddish) to the point where they underrated their athleticism and shooting talent. So a lot of credit to the Suns for recognizing that."
"he also misses badly a lot of times.. he tought taking jaylen brown over dragan bender made the celtics the losers of the draft and said phx couldve missed everything after the #4 pick and still be the winners cause they got dragan. Got JJJ over luka and ayton, while i think JJJ is a great player, having him over luka is a insane miss. Said miami won the 15 draft by getting Justise winslow..."
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
"True that. Spo never got his respect until years after Lebron left.. which blows my mind given he took teams led by Dion Waiters to the playoffs multiple times, AFTER he just won 2 titles.   I don’t believe any other coach could have averaged &gt;.500 over the years Lebron/Wade/Bosh left with the talent left on those Heat rosters (Luke Babbitt, Rodney McGruder, Hassan Whiteside, Justise Winslow… it’s bad)  I’d put Spo in a higher tier as far as coaches goes but I do think Lue is finally getting his respect as a very good coach, which is nice to see."
pretty sure i see taj gibson and justise winslow?
We drafted Justise Winslow over this man. Fade me
Idc if it makes financial sense i don't think Philly would tolerate another season with Australian Justise Winslow
Embiid will be fine. He'll win a ring. Just need McCollum or D'LO for Justise Winslow with an Australian passport
"The justise winslow stat hurts, thanks for reminding me."
JUSTISE MF WINSLOW
"Notable players drafted ahead of Devin Booker in 2015: Jahlil Okafor, Willie Cauley-Stein, Mario Hezonja, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles"
"Not all first round picks are created equal, the average pick outside of the top 5 is rarely going to yield a superstar. If you're getting 18 #1-5 picks, I'd agree with you, but most of those picks are not very good;     2021- #4 position, #16 &amp; #18 (or #5 if the Rockets get insanely unlucky).    2022- Their own first rounder, Clippers 1st rounder (unlikely to be very good), Sunds first rounder (unlikely to be very good).   2023 - Pick swap with Clippers (TBD), Lottery protected heat pick, Lottery protected Nuggets Pick   2024 - Their own pick, Clippers pick (TBD), Rockets (top 4 protected)   2025 - Basically a Clippers pick swap (TBD), 76'ers (top 6 protected)   2026 - Their own pick, Clippers pick (TBD), Rockets (top 4 protected)   2027 - Their own first rounder  Once you look at those protections, you're not going to get 18 guys like Jaylen Brown (#3 overall) or SGA (#11 overall), you're going to get a lot of guys like Josh Jackson, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Mario Hezonja, &amp; Emmanuel Mudiay. If you're lucky, you'll get 2-3 like Jaylen or SGA, which is not worth Luka or Zion."
"Justise Winslow. Thought he be a premium wing, injuries hit and he just clearly wont be the player I thought he would.   Doug Mcdermott has had a solid career but I thought he would be a long term starter and major piece for teams.   Jared Sullinger is a guy I also thought would be a long time starter, borderline all star.   I was young and didnt put a lot of thought into why other than I liked watching them in college and thought they’d only get better in the nba."
Well he did try to trade like 4 FRPs for the right to draft Justise Winslow.  Guess they lucked out there!
"Off the top of my head, Dante Exum, Markelle Fultz, Justise Winslow, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina"
"Justise Winslow. I always figured there was something there if we took him over Devin Booker, and he played good defense. Meanwhile Devin Booker got to the Finals, made several All Star and All NBA teams, and is known as a superstar. And Justise, got bit by the injury bug more than a couple times, never grew his game and eventually became a journeyman that is destined for vet min contracts and the bench. Between him and Beasley it's a toss up for Pat Riley's worst pick ever."
"As a Miami Heat fan, I would redo the 2008 NBA Draft. We had the 2nd overall pick and we picked Michael Beasley who became arguably the worst draft bust in Heat history.  We could have picked Russell Westbrook! Imagine him in the backcourt with a prime Dwyane Wade? Or we could have picked Danilo Gallinari if we really needed a PF.  Alternatively, we could have picked Devin Booker over Justise Winslow in the 2015 NBA Draft! We had the 10th overall pick."
Javale Mcgee for one. Think Justise Winslow had one too
We were starting Justise Winslow at center 😭
RJ Barrett  Malik Monk  Cole Anthony  Kevin Huerter  Rui Hachimura  Christian Wood  Keldon Johnson  Justise Winslow  Pat Connaughton  Malcolm Brogdon  Anfernee Simons  Spencer Dinwiddie  Immanuel Quickley
Justise Winslow. I was convinced he was going to be a multiple time all star
"I wanted Justise Winslow to pan out so much.  It’s not too late for him to salvage his career, but injuries really killed the #pointjustise movement.  Shabazz Napier, too. LeBron believed in him!"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
How fondly I remember the Stanley Johnson/Justise Winslow wars.
"It was a trade that neither team really lost on.   We traded an expiring Iggy, Crowder, &amp; Hill for Winslow plus salary filler. Crowder was a vital piece that helped you to the Finals. We took a gamble on Winslow being the vital piece that we needed to fill out the roster aka an athletic wing who could distribute and create his own shot. It didn't work out for us, but that's the risk you take.   I don't have any particularly hard feelings for Justise. By all accounts he was a good person. The gamble just didn't work out for us."
Justise Winslow will be a productive NBA player one day
Yeah game 7 we had to start Justise Winslow at center against you guys. Things got weird real quick lol
TIL I forgot about the existence of Justise Winslow
"I'm always cautious about prospects that have NBA ready physiques at 17/18, you have to watch very carefully if they're really just dominating their competition on athleticism - for the most part unless you're Zion, that athleticism won't be nearly enough to be great in the NBA without the skills to match. Stanley Johnson and Justise Winslow come to mind."
The idea of Justise Winslow is always better than the actual Justise Winslow.
justise winslow is a replacement level player with upside. i would be surprised if he ever makes more then what the clips are giving him in the future
Justise Winslow 👀 not mad at all
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
Justise Winslow. He was great as point Winslow on the Heat before his injury but he just never could get it back after recovering and being traded. As far as I know he's a free agent and if he lands on a team (which he should even as a reclamation project) he really needs to prove he hasn't lost it.
"Haha, honestly I think we know way too much about all these negotiations. It can be interesting and noteworthy in some extreme cases (like Danny Ainge offering four picks to get Justise Winslow and the Hornets turning it down to draft Frank Kaminsky). But we really don't need to know all the little ins and outs of versions of trades tossed around before one was actually made. But hey, it's content, I guess."
It’s always something with Vic . Like justise Winslow but a tad better.
"THT, Oubre, Derozan, Reggie Jackson  Justise Winslow?"
"Justise Winslow, but for him it at least was likely because he never stopped getting injured."
"All they gave up was a few months of crowder. He was ok for the griz and a good locker room guy, but not part of the future plans and was taking up minutes (and shots) that should be going to one of the many young wings on the roster.   Iggy probably had negative trade value at that point in his career, similar in value to an injured Justise Winslow.   It ended up not being a good trade for the griz, but it doesn’t really deserve the attention it gets. It didn’t move the needle in either direction. Memphis is still on the same trajectory whether the trade happened or not."
Who is like a homeless man's Justise Winslow
I like Kuminga but maybe someone like Justise Winslow
"Ainge was the other type of delusional, offering up 4 first rounders for Justise Winslow lmao"
"i feel like saying you’re interested in moving your pick might get other teams to call you so that you could potentially get another Allen level steal   OKC calls to talk about 3, doesn’t work, but they find a deal with Memphis and we somehow end up with DeAnthony Melton and Justise Winslow.   i prolly play too much basketballGM, but it’s something lol"
"His ceiling is just that high. If his scoring and shot selection develops he’s absolutely insane because he’s absurdly athletic and can playmake. It’s a big if though, because he could just not pan out and become Stanley or Justise Winslow"
did you see justise winslow playing point this past season?
Memphis wasn't doing anything with that cap space anyway. Last year that space was Dieng and Waiters' contract.  Benefits of having Ja and JJJ on rookie deals. Plus we can still free up 15M by not resigning Justise Winslow.
"Sounds like you’re talking yourself into this narrative and wanting your picks to hold value lol.  Ainge attempted to trade around 6 picks to move up a couple spots for….Justise Winslow.   I don’t think he necessarily needed to win every trade, and it’s definitely not confirmed anywhere that he was offering shit deals."
"It's a story that presidents of basketball ops tell their assistant GMs to get them to behave. ""You can't spend $5 million 'taking a shot' on Justise Winslow, or the Salary Cap will come for you in the night!"""
Lebron and Justise Winslow for me
Danny “almost traded” Ainge almost traded 4 FRPs for the draft rights to Justise Winslow
"Are we sure the Hawks drafted for fit? If you look at their respective drafts, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, Okongwu and Johnson each had a strong case for being the best player left on the board. Yes, they all complement Trae but unless you're a big man who can't protect the rim or a small 2 guard who can't play defense, it's really easy to find players who complement Trae.   The Okafor pick is actually defensible when you consider the fact Embiid's injury history. It's hard to draft around a player who hasn't played a single game for you yet. Plus if they drafted for fit, they would've probably ended up with Justise Winslow or Mario Hezonja. Porzingis would've been a tough sell at #3.   The Sixers' problem is that they didn't draft well, not that they didn't think enough about fit. If Fultz didn't get the yips and they didn't trade away Mikal Bridges, we'd be looking at a lineup of Fultz - Bridges - Simmons - Harris - Embiid. Certainly good enough to win a championship."
"I thought Justise Winslow to the Heat was going to allow them to run the East once more  I was also really high on Shabazz Napier , specifically for his toughness and willingness to challenge anyone on a drive.   Clearly I’m GM material"
Nah don’t worry bro I thought Justise Winslow was the next Dwayne Wade and Stanley Johnson the next Kawhi. It was a weird draft lol
"Same. Liked him since his duke days. That was a likable team. Tyus Jones, Quinn Cook, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen before his reputation, Semi Ojeleye, a Plumlee bro. They had a squad"
*Cries in Justise Winslow*
with Justise Winslow.
That's what Justise Winslow thought.
We traded for Justise Winslow to be a secondary ball handler and defender. Simmons is a 3x all star that fits that role
We tried Justise Winslow as a secondary ball handler and good defender. We used SloMo in that role instead. Ben would be the all star player for that role. Also he’s a better Tony Allen who we are putting in the rafters this season it would most definitely work with us
I will never not root for Justise fucking Winslow.
Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson
Believing Justise Winslow was the future of our franchise if he was just given sole PG duties. JUST IS BETTER was a dark time...
"What the Grizz are doing for the Clippers (saving them $35 million the luxury tax in the Bledsoe for Beverley, Rando, &amp; Oturu trade is a bigger deal that Grizz buyouts taking veteran minimums from the Lakers.   The Heat deal added tens of millions in salaries to the Grizz just to make an attempt try out Justise Winslow.   If there is an issue with the Lakers getting all these buyout players, then it’s an issue with the NBA, not the Grizz."
"They definitely didn't plan on that, of course, but he had been an extremely injury-plagued player. I always just thought it was funny how the Grizzlies made this big point of sticking to their guns about refusing to buy out Iguodala for $15 million only to immediately buy out Dion Waiters for $25 million as soon as they got him in that trade. It's like, yes, technically you were true to your word, but was that really the smart thing? They should have just hung on to Crowder and Hill and re-signed them that summer. $85 million and those guys is a lot of money and assets to take a flier on Justise Winslow, IMO."
"Pretty sure that was in relation to Andre Iguodala and their refusal to buy out his expiring $17 million contract. But since they ended up trading him (along with Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill) for the combined $85 million in salary of Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng, and Justise Winslow, I'm not sure they actually got any assets back. In two years those three players combined to play only 65 games for Memphis, and now all of them are no longer on the roster, with none being traded to bring back anything further."
"To make up for spending $85 million on Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng and Justise Winslow over the last two seasons. Gotta recoup that loss somehow."
"Memphis should have just bought him out on his expiring $17 million contract and been done with it. Instead they ended up trading him, Solomon Hill and Jae Crowder to Miami and got back Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng and Justise Winslow.   Now let's look at how that played out, shall we? They immediately ended up buying out Waiters 2 years and $25 million remaining and bought out Dieng this past year, and then Winslow left in free agency this summer. Waiters never played a game for the Grizzlies, Winslow only played a total of 26 games for Memphis and Dieng only played a total of 39 games for Memphis in the two years they had these guys.   So what did these 65 combined games over two years of Dieng and Winslow cost Memphis? Well, in addition to losing Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill, Memphis ended up spending $85 million on Waiters, Dieng and Winslow. In retrospect, simply buying out Iguodala would have been the smart move."
"Per IG, Simmons, Rondo, Jordan Clarkson, Justise Winslow, JJJ, Jarred Vanderbilt, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Brandon Clarke, BJ Boston were at the most recent run, and Michael Beasley, Lonnie Walker, Ja, Maxey, and Bazely have gone to other ones."
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
"For Miami, it’s Michael Beasley, Justise Winslow, and possibly Precious Achiuwa (maybe too soon to call, but we traded him after only one season)."
And then Justise Winslow
"I genuinely thought Justise Winslow was gonna be who Jimmy Butler is for us right now. Defensive point forward leader of the team. He showed some flashes during the Point Justise days but couldn't really sustain it.  If it wasn't for Butler coming in and being what he is, I would have been so salty that Justise didn't work out."
"i also forgot to add Justise Winslow up there, he seems to always be out injured"
"i was high on luka, didn’t think he was far and away number 1 but was making the harden comp well in advance of the draft, and i thought haliburton was a steal. however i was also super high on stanley johnson and justise winslow and thought ant edwards and lamelo would bust"
Finally someone intelligent. He’s best suited as a Justise Winslow type player. By that I mean he shouldn’t get playing time and should get cut by mid season
"I met Antoine Walker in a Benihana in Coral Gables on Christmas day Justise Winslow outside some juice shop in midtown Shaq in the street in Brickell.  Never met Alonzo Mourning, but I’ve seen him a couple times: coconut grove and midtown"
Justise Winslow.
"Not exactly the same, but all of last season Justise Winslow would do this neat trick where he would launch the ball towards the basket and see how far into the stands he could bounce it, the wild part was he was actually better at these trick shots in game."
I was 100% convinced that Jahlil Okafor was going to be the next big thing and that he would bring the post-oriented big man back into the spotlight. I also thought his Duke teammate Justise Winslow was gonna turn into a LeBron-lite type player.
"The Heats ""culture"" is based off outdated thinking and it's a terrible way to run a team with everything we know about health and recovery. Justise Winslow would have ended up a borderline all star without the injury problems if he was drafted to a different organization."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"This is pretty wild      The 10th overall pick from those years for comparison     CJ McCollum, Elfrid Payton, Thon Maker, Zach Collins, Justise Winslow, Mikal Bridges.     I would take team 27th in a heartbeat.    What's wilder is that I had to go all the way down to the 5th overall pick to find a group I would take above them (Trae+Fox), which even then is less consistent overall."
&gt;he's by far the best looking NBA player of all time.   He's objectively attractive but give me Kelly Oubre or Justise Winslow over this man any day.   The trafficking thing is kind of a turn on though

"I really want to wish Justise Winslow well, but fuck the clippers."
"Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson, Justise Winslow"
"As a heat fan, the unwarranted optimism on Justise Winslow. The man couldn’t make a layup and was an abysmal shooter but “he can be our point guard”. That whole argument was so ridiculous."
Justise Winslow. Bought a ton of stock and i am still holding on to it. Til this day
"I’m optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
Justise Winslow
"probably bledsoe. the hate has died down a bit since he's been playing better, but i think most of the fanbase would still rather terance start over him.  if that's too obvious, i guess justise winslow. seems like a great guy, but his offense is so bad he's almost unplayable."
"Even before jimmy, that sixers series during Simmons' rookie year was pretty tense. Dwyane Wade grabbing Justin Anderson by his arms and basically throwing him during game 3. James Johnson trying to fight Ben Simmons. Justise Winslow stepping on Embiids goggles/mask during game 3.  It was a physical series."
"“The Celtics made a strong final push to multiple teams in spots 4-9 on draft day. It culminated with an all-in effort in attempt to get Charlotte to deliver the No. 9 pick with Boston lusting for Duke forward Justise Winslow (the same player they coveted while trying to shuffle higher).  According to sources, the Celtics' final offer to the Hornets was a package that could have featured as many as six draft picks, including four potential first-round selections (a combination of picks from this draft and in the future). But the Hornets could not be swayed and turned down multiple offers to select Wisconsin center Frank Kaminsky.“  From an SB Nation article"
justise winslow
Justise Winslow
dude the other night I was like huh is that Ronny Turiaf on the Clippers? turns out it was Justise Winslow
I’m still holding on to my Justise Winslow stocks. But real answer: Gary Trent Jr
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
Justise winslow
"Underrated hallmark is ability to find minutes for lesser role players and have those guys excel in their role. It’s why teams uncovered gems like Bruce Brown, GP2, Juan Toscano Anderson.. the role players that probably would not shine for other teams in other situation but coaching and that situation just works.   Billy Donovan and his 3 guards line up, from OKC to Chicago gets some credit here along this line too, you just gotta make it work and find minutes for guys. Brad Stevens able to make jt work with Evan Turner and that got ET paid. Miami under Spoelstra got the likes of Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow look kinda good. Those guys production just drop off the moment they move on from Miami."
"He was my pick to become one of the best players in his prime. I'm still rooting for him and mostly for the dumbest reasons possible. One of the reasons is his name honestly, like imagine hearing the name Justise Winslow and thinking ""that dude has to be one of the best players in the league"" then you look him up and weep at all the potential being wasted."
"Justise Winslow, as many predicted, hasn't looked great.  He would've been better as a 1 year minimum guy.  I don't know why they gave him 2 years at 4m each."
I saw Justise Winslow on the court and thought man Kawhi looks terrible
Then you haven't seen Justise Winslow
