"Forgot about zeke, good call out there.  Jokic will be remembered as a center, not a PF. He has a ton of work ahead of him to break into that group, but he might be able to do it. Center is hard, though. Even comparing them across eras is difficult because the game is so different. And the pace is much slower so the stats aren’t quite the same. David Robinson was a hell of a center who isn’t even in this top 5.  AD might be able to do it at PF, but it will likely depend on lebron carrying him to more rings if we are being totally honest. Giannis probably doesn’t get there if he can’t develop a jumper. When his athleticism fades, I’m not sure what he will be able to do to stay as a top tier player. And to be top 5, you have to have longevity or you have to just have insane peaks - aka be Magic Johnson.  I’d probably slide KG and Dirk up slightly and Malone/Barkley down but that’s picking nits as they are probably all top 5. And part of that is probably hindsight bias against Malone for the off the court stuff."
"Ridder: When I think back to that day, that's what I continuously see over and over in my mind: Kobe backing Coop down for those turnaround fadeaway 16-foot jumpers, tongue out, from the baseline, the free throw line, the elbow, all around. Kobe hitting those from everywhere.  Carbone: Kobe was about the 10,000-hour rule even as a teenager. In high school, on Saturdays he'd lift at St. Joseph's and then I'd rebound for him when he'd shoot. He had just started when the lady who ran the gym yelled, ""We're closing!"" and then, boom, with no warning she shut off all the lights. I'm holding the ball in the dark, thinking, OK, I guess we're done, and Kobe yells, ""Give me the ball!"" I was actually afraid for a little bit because he yelled it so loud. But I gave him the ball and he kept shooting in the dark for another half-hour. Swish. Swish. Swish.  Black: I don't remember if it was 10 shots in a row that he made or more. I knew Michael Cooper pretty well and he was very proud, and he definitely took that request from Jerry as a challenge. He wanted to shut Kobe down. I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think Michael was embarrassed by what Kobe did to him that day.  Kupchak: The ease with which at 17 he was able to compete with one of the all-time great defenders in the game, that's what really stood out.  Cooper: When I did force him to take a bad shot, he'd just smile and shoot me that eye of the tiger.  Ridder: I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Then Jerry stands up after what felt like only 20 minutes and, I'll never forget this, he says: ""Let's get out of here. I've seen enough. This kid's better than anybody we have on our team right now.""  Jerry West: He was incredibly gifted in terms of skill at that point. It was a very impressive workout and, frankly, a lot more than expected. And all of a sudden your antenna goes up and you think, Oh my gosh, this kid's really good. With our position in the draft, at No. 24, I was just thinking: There's no way, we have no chance of getting this guy.  Ryan West: Larry Drew was a Lakers assistant at the time. Someone asked him what he thought that day and his line always stuck with me. He said, ""That man is the truth.""      ""This guy's the next Jordan. I gotta get him.""     New Jersey Nets coach John Calipari, after Kobe worked out for the team in the spring on 1996  As they were leaving the gym, Jerry West turned to an exhausted Cooper and joked: ""I thought you were going to guard him?""  Jerry West: Coop was a good one. I gave him a hard time about it. It was just Father Time. I told him, ""You're just too damn old and this guy, he's just too damn good."" Regardless of who Kobe worked out against, he was going to be the best player on the floor.  Kupchak: He was just obsessed with competition to a level you don't see in young players very often. You don't get that maniacal competitiveness very often, and here we were seeing it with someone who was 17.  Cooper: When I finished that workout, and my part in it was probably only 20-30 minutes, it felt like I had played a seven-game series with the Celtics again. Like I had just finished facing Larry Bird and Dennis Johnson. My body was aching something bad. Early in the pre-draft process, Kobe worked out against Celtics icon and coach Dennis Johnson, who had been named NBA All-Defense nine times in his career. Johnson learned a lesson Cooper would also learn just weeks later: Kobe was no ordinary teenager. Tom Landers/The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Coincidentally, a few weeks earlier, when Kobe worked out for Boston, he was matched up against Johnson, Cooper's nemesis, who was then an assistant coach with the Celtics. The results were very similar, and timeless: Age yields to youth. In his Boston workout and especially in his interview with team execs, Kobe wowed the entire Celtics organization, all the way up to team president Red Auerbach himself. The hardest part of the entire ordeal for Kobe, who had grown up a die-hard Lakers fan, was having to put on the Celtic Green workout gear. Kobe and West were kindred spirits in that regard: After losing to the Celtics six times in the NBA Finals as a player, West had forbidden that particular shade of green in his house.  Cooper: Afterward, I'm sweating like a b---- over there and Jerry leans in and asks me, ""Coop, what do you think?"" And I was like, ""Jerry, he's f---ing good, man."" Right after that, Jerry says: ""This is our guy."" I'll never forget that: ""This is the kid."" And then everyone said it: This is our pick, this is our guy. And you know what? Thank God.  Jerry West: You watch a workout like that -- there isn't much of a choice to think of anything else. I remember saying to Jerry Buss, our owner, I said, ""Jerry, he's the best player in the draft."" I meant it. I would have taken Kobe as the first player in the draft. It was a no-brainer. He had this -- forget desire -- he just didn't want to stop playing. Ever.  Ryan West: After the workout, it was so funny, driving back to Santa Monica he wanted to go find an empty gym to go play in and he was trying, the whole time, to convince me to take him somewhere to find a pickup game. I finally said, ""Kobe, you're in the pre-draft process for the NBA. I don't know if you want to risk getting injured."" Knowing him, when I dropped him off at the hotel he probably found a way to go somewhere and play or at least work on his game.  Ridder: We all hopped back into Jerry's car and sat there in sheer amazement at what we had just seen.  Black: I think Jerry was a Mercedes guy, and in his car he was raving the whole time: ""That's the best workout I've ever seen.""

A few days later, with Kobe still in town shooting his commercial, the Lakers brought him back for one more workout, this time with Dontae' Jones, the 6-8 220-pound senior power forward who had just carried Mississippi State to the Final Four and was a projected first-rounder.  Heisler: This was a big, strong guy. He was a load. Before that workout started, the Lakers probably thought there was a very good chance that Dontae' Jones was gonna kick Kobe's ass.  Ryan West: They were so impressed by what Kobe had done to Cooper, the idea with the second workout was, let's validate, let's see if he can do this against somebody who is ready to play in the NBA right now. Dontae' Jones was a physical specimen and Kobe just had his way with him. The first thing Dontae' did was try to use his strength and bully him by taking him down into the post and shooting a jump hook. Kobe blocked it. The second workout was even much more impressive than the first and, with my dad, it started a borderline obsession with Kobe.  Kupchak: Afterward we went to a Subway and sat down and had lunch with Arn. Kobe and Ryan West were at another table. They were either talking about, or playing, video games. This Subway had an outdoor seating area that was a little more private because Jerry couldn't really go many places in L.A. Kobe was fine. Nobody knew who he was. ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen  Ridder: Jerry's a notoriously fast eater. He's the fastest eater in the world. A sandwich or a burrito, he'd scarf that thing down in four minutes and we'd be back in the car. Knowing Jerry he scarfed his lunch down even faster that day because he was in a hurry to get back to the Forum and start figuring out a way to swing a trade to get this kid.  Ryan West: Taking Kobe back to his hotel the second time it all just seemed like the perfect marriage. Everyone at the Lakers was so enamored with him. And him being in Los Angeles and being a Laker, it all made too much sense. They were going to find a way to get him no matter what. The draft was only a couple weeks away. When I dropped him off, he said, ""I don't know when I'll see you again."" And I kinda winked at him and said, ""I have a feeling I'm gonna see you again pretty soon.""  Heisler: Kobe was pretty OK going to the Nets, until he came out west for his Lakers workouts. Now Kobe's hanging out with Ryan West and eating dinner at the Wests' house and he's part of the family. This was the most important part of this whole thing: Every team that brought in Kobe -- the Clippers, the Suns and others -- they all said it was the greatest workout they had ever seen and immediately started trying to make moves to get him. But at that point Kobe decided he wanted to be a Laker, and he didn't want to be anything else. The big thing they had to do was shake New Jersey.  After wolfing down his footlong sub, Jerry West hatched a plan. Because the Lakers weren't picking until 24th in the draft, his priority to that point had been trying to lure free agent Shaquille O'Neal from Orlando to Los Angeles. First, though, West had to move Lakers center Vlade Divac and his $4.7 million salary to clear roster and cap space for Shaq's seven-year, $120 million offer. Now, also needing to move up in order to grab Kobe, the deal took on even more significance -- almost too much. West later wrote that the stress sent him ""spiraling downward and into the hospital for exhaustion for a few days."""
"Hell, if you want the pure, unadulterated analytics take on Kobe, I can give that to you. I created a metric a couple years ago that rates players purely on stats. It’s a completely garbage thought experiment, not something that should be taken seriously. It does a really bad job of taking defense into account.   Oh God, I’m probably going to regret this.   Based on pure per game statistical output compared to their peers among all *retired* (LeBron and anyone else still playing not included) players, Kobe Bryant is the 32nd best player amongst the qualified players. 2nd best shooting guard behind MJ, slightly ahead of Jerry West.   Top ten overall statistically.   1. Wilt Chamberlain  2. Oscar Robertson  3. Magic Johnson  4. Michael Jordan  5. Bob Pettit  6. Elgin Baylor  7. Larry Bird  8. Bill Russell  9. David Robinson  10. Hakeem Olajuwon   Top 10 shooting guards  1. Michael Jordan  2. Kobe Bryant  3. Jerry West  4. Allen Iverson  5. Clyde Drexler  6. Pete Maravich  7. Alvin Robertson  8. Tom Gola  9. Richie Guerin  10. Tracy McGrady   Like I said, it’s complete bull crap, so take it with a grain of salt. I personally have Kobe at 13 in my list slightly ahead of Dr. J. (Who is around 42 on this metric).   Also, the shooting guard position is the statistically weakest position in NBA history. Kobe placing anywhere near the top 50 in this metric is a hell of an accomplishment just due to how it works."

"Almost everyone who has received a scary call from a doctor has that same reaction.  Both my friend and my uncle recently did, in response to the news that had very-treatable cancers.  That's completely normal -- even in cases like Johnson's, where, as a young, healthy male, his odds of being killed soon by HIV were extremely long, even then.  Even with no treatment at all, it typically takes a decade to fifteen years before HIV even develops into AIDS.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;He was the leader in the All-Star voting. He felt fine. He called Stern and asked him if he could play.   &gt;   &gt;The commissioner, knowing he was racheting up the stakes, said yes -- and braced himself for the outcry that would follow.   &gt;   &gt;He fielded phone calls from a handful of his owners who insisted Johnson should remain sidelined, who fretted aloud about the safety of their own players.   &gt;   &gt;The commissioner warned them they'd be slapped with a lawsuit if they discriminated against Magic. It could lead, he explained, to mandatory HIV testing for every player in the league, something both Stern and the Players Association vehemently opposed.   &gt;   &gt;Stern asked his owners if they were certain that Magic Johnson was the only NBA player who was HIV positive.   &gt;   &gt;""Because I'm not,"" he said.   &gt;   &gt;Another owner urged the commissioner to conduct ""some polling"" on the issue before he welcomed Magic back.   &gt;   &gt;""That doesn't work for me,"" Stern countered. ""I want us to affect the polls.""   &gt;   &gt;The owners weren't the only ones with reservations. Players, coaches, general managers and trainers had questions of their own.   &gt;   &gt;""It was volatile,"" Stern conceded, ""but the approach was to make it seem very unvolatile.""   &gt;   &gt;The owners agreed to stand behind Stern's decision, but it was hardly unanimous. A potential public relations nightmare hovered over the NBA for the next several months.   &gt;   &gt;""I work for what I believe is in the best interest of all the owners,"" said Stern. ""There are times when a particular owner or team has a different view. When events are fast-moving, I have to do what is best for the league. For the most part, the owners took our lead.""   &gt;   &gt;Pacers owner Herb Simon confirmed the uncharted waters of Magic's potential return ignited discussion, debate and some dissension.   &gt;   &gt;""We were all concerned in the beginning,"" Simon said, ""but the way David handled it was so right on. By the time he was done \[briefing us\], I wasn't concerned for the league at all.""   &gt;   &gt;The players were not so sure. They were terrified of contracting the HIV virus from Magic. His own Lakers teammates were afraid to work out or shoot baskets with him.   &gt;   &gt;""Players were grumbling, wives were grumbling, and by the way, they were absolutely right,"" Rosen said. ""You've got to remember, back then everyone thought if Earvin shook their hand, they'd die.""   &gt;   &gt;Charles Barkley, who starred for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, said what Stern did next diffused the brewing controversy -- he ordered every NBA franchise to be visited by a physician who would separate facts from fiction regarding HIV and AIDS.   &gt;   &gt;""The doctor sat us all down and let us clear the air,"" Barkley said. ""He covered everything anyone wanted to ask. He told us we couldn't get HIV from rubbing up against someone or bumping into them. We couldn't get it from their sweat or from a cut. That was important, because nobody knew anything about the disease.   &gt;   &gt; \[elided\]   &gt;   &gt;That change went global when Johnson expressed his plans to keep his roster spot in the 1992 Olympic Dream Team. The international community barked in protest. An official from the Australian Olympic Federation recommended his team boycott the Games if Magic was allowed to suit up. One of the Australian players said he'd accept a silver medal rather than battle Magic on the court for the gold. Stern utilized his global influence to again smooth the waters for Magic.   &gt;   &gt;""Without David, there's no way Magic gets that gold medal,"" said Rosen. ""Not a chance.""   &gt;   &gt;Johnson attempted two more short-lived comebacks. One, in 1992-93, was thwarted by lingering paranoia about his condition, fueled by uninformed comments from Karl Malone and Mark Price.   &gt;   &gt;[https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/10368340/how-david-stern-handled-magic-johnson-hiv-announcement](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/10368340/how-david-stern-handled-magic-johnson-hiv-announcement)  &amp;#x200B;  Ignorance and fear were the only reasons that Johnson was forced to ""retire"" in 1991."
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."

"I like civil debates. My goal isn't to make this incendiary but its late where I am so if my wording makes it incendiary I apologize.    ""not based on any type of fact""  Lets look at his most commonly praised skills: 3pt shooting, and offball movement. Tell me what good is creating open looks for teammates who can't shoot, or tell me what good being open to receive passes does if your teammates aren't good passers and opt to take the shot instead? He isn't a top 10 iso player, he isn't someone who is known for driving by defenders by force, and he isn't the passing god like CP3, Draymond, or even Lebron are. He isn't a BAD passer, but thats not what puts him in the MVP tier.   ""In the case of 2012-2013 or 2013-2014, this was when Steph legitimately led teams to the playoffs when his best teammate was David Lee.""  Well first of all he had Klay, so idk about it being a solo carry job--also bogut was there, at least for half the season. I mean, Klay and Lee at least can use steph's spacing no? Green wasn't good until he utilized properly, but Klay was never bad.   ""But moreso than that, Steph became the engine of the team, and thus it was hard to separate his success from his team's success.""  Green is the engine. Green is the floor general that leads Kerr's motion offense. Sure Klay and Curry being historic shooters help, but motion is a high IQ system and I don't think many people would disagree if I said Green is the highest IQ warriors player. I mean regardless motion offense is a team effort, not a solo effort; thats why the most famous motion offenses are all borderline super-teams/super teams (2014 Spurs, MVP season Curry). But maybe we just define engine differently. Maybe my definition is wrong, but semantics aside, Curry isn't the sole reason Kerr's offense works.   ""Everyone always tries to discredit the fact that Steph is the reason his teams are so good, and instead rely on the idea that he's great or has major success because of his teams. ""  Not my argument. My argument is that one of steph's greatest and rarest strengths is that he makes an offense better just by existing. He isn't an iso player, he isn't a Magic Johnson type passer, he isn't a bully in the paint player. I can't think of any player in history that has steph's skillset and comparing him to Dame, Kyrie, Harden, any other guard, is ignoring half his strengths.   ""If Dame was on this exact same team, I don't think that they have a better record.""  I picked out those three because they're selfish Iso players who don't necessarily ""want"" help. Look at some of the bad games the warriors have had. Its usually because steph's teammates can't take advantage of his gravity and brick very open 3s. Defenses leave oubre and Green open until they drive and instead triple team curry because...well why bother guarding them? Dame doesn't have nearly the same off-ball movement Steph does, but he is better at iso, and is better at playing hero ball. Same with Harden--I mean his MVP caliber seasons have been him playing one man offense (I know he had help but he isn't the passing magician or an off-ball god he isos and step-back 3s). These selfish players have an easier time dismantling bad teams, but against more sophisticated defenses, they hit a brick wall. Look at the Bucks last year: they had one of the easiest offenses to ""figure"" out and got knocked out fast. Look at the Lakers in comparison: they have one of the best passers on the main unit, and a historically great passer off the bench.   ""So there's an example of his floor raising happening right now.""  Green is also back, Wiseman is an addition whether as a starter (debatable) or off the bench. Paschall had a year to grow and is better now than he was last year. Oubre isn't the player we hoped for, but he is at the very least a positive addition from last year. Wiggins had time to gel with the Warriors (we played most of it with DLo last year). Wasn't Looney also injured last year? I think this year's team, even without curry, is a lot better than last year's team, so I'm not sure this is the best example.   ""He is simply much more talented than every other point guard""  Overall? Sure. He isn't better at iso than the guard I listed. He can't be a force in the paint compared with plenty of bigger guards (I mean he's NBA-short at 6'3)  ""To say he isn't a floor raiser is relying on lazy narrative as opposed to watching the actual games."" I watch most if not all their games.  ""The reason he has a better iso game is because he's a significantly better shooter than all of the aforementioned players outside of KD""/Iso talk  Well first of all I wouldn't say significantly. I dislike Kyrie too but he still is an all-star caliber player lets not go too far.  Second, being good at iso means you can....well isolate a match up and create on your own. That comes from Kyrie like handles, or having multiple different ways to score whether thats shooting accuracy, or driving to the basket, etc. I mean think about Ben Simmons. He has the physical tools to drive to the paint, but because his offensive skillset is very limited (no shooting), he is hampered on offense. Not trying to compare the two just using Ben to illustrate the idea of how a ""limited"" skillset hampers offense. Also not trying to say steph is that limited, but he doesn't have the size to bully through defenders (like, say, Kobe, could). Also not trying to start the dame vs curry debate because they're very different players and a comparison is very context dependent.   ""This is an example of glorifying one on one basketball when it doesn't have a significant baring on the success of a team.""  Nope. That would imply my argument were ""Iso means you're better"" which it wasn't. Iso is definitely a part of basketball, and its one where curry isn't a goat in. Also, Kobe was an Iso-god, and he contributed to team success. Harden is an iso player and he led the rockets to conference finals, only losing to a historic team.   ""The people who repeated the narrative that Steph couldn't carry the team are the same people that don't understand what makes him so great, yeah.""  Well i'm saying he isn't a floor raiser while at the same time saying that its because his gravity is a solid part of why he's an all time great with the likes of the ""not quite Lebron or MJ"" tier players. I mean, if I had to do an all time PG ranking, he'd be easily ahead of Kyrie and Dame. Thats, however, not because he can take a 5 win team and make them a playoff team (I mean again if you surround him with 30% shooters, why would teams NOT triple team him? He can run off ball all he wants if his teammates are too low IQ/skill to take advantage of it. ). Thats because he can take a 40 win team and make them a title contender. Put curry on the, say, wizards, and all that means is teams box1 and hound curry. He either shoots with multiple defenders in his face or passes to a teammate who probably bricks a shot. Off ball, he can run around all he wants. He can disrupt the opponent's defense all he wants but if nobody passes to him  or his teammates can't make easy shots, then what does that even do?"
"Mugsy/Kemba/Glen Rice/Larry Johnson/Mourning with Marvin Williams, David Wesley, and Okafor off the bench? They'd still easily be contenders."

"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.

I dont blame Watson. They traded his boy and top WR DHop for David Johnson who has been slowing down for years now. Id be mad too. Harden is just on a Kyrie level of not giving a fuck and i cant respect that. Play for your team bro. Hearing guys like Wall who battled back for 2 years get disrespected by Harden is uncalled for and fucked up tbh. Harden comments on the state of team should have stayed in house.
Best I can do is David Johnson and a second rounder
"&gt; I don't think it's about a different era.  Yep, Taylor talked about this with Danny Leroux on Real GM Radio last week. He doesn't think it's fair to look at David Robinson and say (I'm paraphrasing), ""Well he didn't shoot 3s, therefore he doesn't stretch the floor as well as a modern big,"" but thinks that is fair game to say, ""Robinson had great hands, timing and could jump to the top of the square, so if he got to play with a pick and roll ball handler better than Avery Johnson he could have been even more devastating.""   Personally, I find both thought experiments (the time machine and just different contemporary teammates/systems) interesting and fun to talk about, even if it is just conjecture."

"What I’m about to say is controversial. So controversial, that I don’t agree with it personally.   Oscar Robertson is the second best individual player to ever play in the NBA/ABA. A while back, I decided to create a formula to see which player, statistically speaking was the greatest to ever play. This does not include championships, all-star appearances, etc. Just pure career stats condensed into a very complicated and annoying formula that gave a per game score, similar to game score, but formulated differently.   Here is the top 20 according to my formula.  1. Wilt Chamberlain  2. Oscar Robertson 3. Magic Johnson 4. Michael Jordan 5. Bob Pettit 6. Elgin Baylor 7. Larry Bird 8. Bill Russell 9. David Robinson 10. Hakeem Olajuwon 11. Charles Barkley 12. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 13. Karl Malone 14. Shaquille O’Neal 15. Neil ‘Gabby’ Johnston 16. Jerry Lucas 17. Artis Gilmore 18. Walt Bellamy 19. Mel Daniels 20. Jason Kidd  One of the major flaws was the fact that big men and point guards inherently have more statistical dominance than wing players. I was working on a way to adjust based on that dynamic before I abandoned the project."
"&gt;Robinson contributed defensively while he was expiring on the Spurs to Duncan's two Championships.   He did much more than that.  After Ewing got hurt, the Knicks were shorthanded upfront in 1999, leaving them with a tough decision.  They had a world-class defender in Marcus Camby, and 6'9"" Kurt Thomas and 6'6"" Larry Johnson -- decidedly not world-class defenders.  They put Camby on 33 year-old Robinson, and mostly took their chances with Thomas and Johnson on Duncan.  Duncan predictably torched the much smaller pair, leading to his first Finals MVP.  Had Ewing been available, none of that happens.  David Robinson is criminally underrated in general."

"&gt;I'd like you to show me where I said Duncan or Robinson were better than when judging their careers?   So you are bailing on your entire premise now?  Or you were just trolling and don't really believe anything you said?  By the way, you did say:  ""But he did it without Drob, and his season was better statistically than even some of the years he played with Robinson by your own admission, thus disproving this little theory because that's not how causation works. And Robinson owes more to Duncan than the other way around for carrying his old, shell of himself version of himself to a title on the way out. And its silly to even suggest that 2003 Robinson is some type of insane level of championship help.""  Which sounds a hell of lot like you think Duncan was the better player.  So spell it out.  Who was the better basketball player between David Robinson and Tim Duncan?  Make an actual argument instead of wasting my time with this disingenuous flittering around.  &gt;This would be accurate if we were talking peak Robinson, not early 2000s Robinson. At that point, Duncan was more suitable to play the 4.   Duncan was drafted in 1997, not ""early 2000s"".  Would've thought you knew that too, but apparently not.  &gt;If you think early 2000s Robinson was a better fit for the 4, why didn't they play him there?  Because you move the lesser player.  Duh.  As I already mentioned, Spurs' opponents routinely voted on who they thought was better, when they matched-up.  And the Knicks put a world-class defender on Robinson in 1999, and left Larry Johnson to try and handle Duncan.  Among many other such examples.  Which is, again, exactly why Duncan's numbers fall as soon as he is no longer lucky enough to be teamed with Robinson.  And why, in virtually every important game that Duncan played for a team other than San Antonio, he came up short."
"Now that all 13 are out I'll bite the bullet and rank my personal peaks based on these videos alone.  1. Lebron James, simply put that version of Lebron is quite literally unstoppable on both sides of the court.   2. Shaquille O'Neal, I would have him #1 but in terms of offensive dominance only Steph really rivals him but in other avenues.  3. David Robinson, yes really, criminally underrated stretch for him that gets overshadowed by Hakeem. In those years he was either scoring leader, blocks leader, DPOY, or all of those.  4. Steph Curry, really wanted to have him higher and don't get me wrong Steph is an underrated defensive player but the 3 ahead of him brought it both ways at a high level but Currys offense alone catapults him over a bunch of 2 way guys in this list.  5. Kevin Garnett, another one that's probably a head scratcher but hear me out. At his peak he was an MVP, first team all defense, first team all nba, and was able to drag a lifeless team to the WCF as a supposed not #1 option. We can have the debate about Duncan being better all time which is not debatable imo but I've always said I'd take peak Garnett over Peak Duncan.  6. Michael Jordan, this isn't to say Jordan isn't better than these ppl, just that the stretch Ben chose (although valid) I personally would have gone back a year on each to account for 1988 when he was DPOY, MVP, but to each their own.  7. Tim Duncan, again like Garnett you had someone who was MVP, First team all nba and defense, and was winning finals MVPs. I guess I underestimated his defensive value because I only watched him 2010 and on when (to me) it seemed like he was just a post defender.  8. Hakeem Olajuwon, really Hakeem should be higher but like Jordan, his PEAK wasn't much better than his career (which is a compliment) so he falls to the wayside.  9. Larry Bird, now this is tough because Larry was god tier on both sides of the ball but not quite dominant in the sense that ppl like Shaq or Hakeem were.   10. Kobe Bryant, this is tough again because the game was different and Kobe's game was heavily ""mid 2000s"" with tons of mid range jumpers and contested fadeways. The fact that he was first team all defense while averaging 35 a game says something though.  11. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, tremendous peak but really he was good for his entire career even until his 40s which hurts him IMO. 6 MVPs with his first being in 1971 and the last being in 1980 means his career was basically a peak, much like lebron.  12. Magic Johnson, wasn't too impressed with his video and this is me being young and not understanding his impact. Very good offensive player but very poor defensive player on anyone who was laterally quick and didn't play in the post.  13. Bill Walton, least impressive peak by far but not someone I even expected on this list. Never knew how good of a passer and shot blocker he was.  He didn't post these but here are some good honorable mentions:  - 08/09 Dwyane Wade - 17-19 James Harden - 15-17 Russell Westbrook - 90-93 Charles Barkley - 16-18 Lebron - 07-09 Lebron - 75-78 Julius Erving"

Magic Johnson does his job and gets fined 500K.  David Griffin questions the integrity of the game just because his baby got a booboo and gets fined 50K.
"Plus his personal doctor, David Ho, not only put him on to the drugs, he actually created the triple drug cocktail treatment that literally turned AIDS from a death sentence to a chronic disease. He got first dibs at the drugs and they were crazy expensive at the time.   But people just don’t know how horrible aids was in the 80s and 90s. I mean not only did people die nearly 100 percent of the time, but you would die a horrible, horrible, horrible death: severe wasting, facial disfiguring from KS lesions, dementia, blindness, opportunistic infections previously only seen in animals.   That was aids in the 80s and 90s. People were afraid Magic was going to die the way Freddie Mercury died.  If you told anybody back in 1991 that Magic Johnson would still be alive today then they’re lying to you. All praise to modern medicine."
"Why did you do too 15? There are plenty of times in NBA history where the top 15 was significantly better than it is today. However, if you did top 50, then the top 50 of this era is much better than almost all other eras.   I mean just take a look at 1990. In no strict order, here are just 15 of the top players in 1990:  Michael Jordan  Magic Johnson  Charles Barkley  Hakeem Olajuwon  David Robinson  Karl Malone  Patrick Ewing  Isiah Thomas  John Stockton  Clyde Drexler  Chris Mullin  Dominique Wilkins  James Worthy  Kevin Johnson  Larry Bird (who was injured at that point but still put up 19.4/8.5/7.2 and was still a lot better than your 15th player Bradley Beal)  This doesn’t even include Bernard King (who was a former scoring champion who averaged 28.5 the next year), your young players like Tim Hardaway, Reggie Miller, or Mitch Richmond, and also someone like Tom Chambers who averaged over 27 a game that year."
"&gt; The players you listed that would have been top 5 in 2012 would not have been top 5 in 2011. Wade, Lebron, Kobe, CP3, and Dwight  I think there's a typo in what you wrote, but many of those players now are playing at a higher level than Dwight has ever played (Giannis and AD are both easily better than Dwight ever was, for starters), and higher than Kobe in 2011 who averaged a ho-hum 25/5/5 on 55% TS.  &gt; This would be the top 10 in 2010-2011 time; Kobe/Lebron/CP3/Wade/Dwight/Dirk/Duncan/Rose/Durant/Carmelo.  I used the year 2012 so let's go with that (it's slightly better towards the late 2000s as you get more into the prime of Kobe, KG, Duncan, Nash, Dirk, and others).  Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Kobe were clearly past their prime by 2012 (and had a much greater dropoff in production than, say, LeBron at a similar age).  &gt; Some notable guys left off the list include Rondo(lead Celtics to a 7 game series against 2011-2012 Heat), Chris Bosh, Griffin, Love, etc.  I don't see any argument that any of these players are anywhere near any of the players I listed.  Bosh, Griffin, and especially Love (who joined Cleveland at 26 in what should have been his absolute prime and then was instantly revealed to actually be a pure good stats/bad team player), are not as good as Giannis, AD, Jokic, and Embiid (to name the big men alone).    The early 2010s also included other all-NBA selections like David Lee, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Zach Randolph, Joe Johnson, Tyson Chandler, etc.  Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge made all-NBA teams virtually every year during this timeframe.  Again, all perfectly fine players, but none of them are anywhere near the players I mentioned, and none of them had any significant success as the best player on their teams (not even talking about success in terms of 'titles' but even 'winning playoff series').   &gt; Also the pace and scoring was also just much lower back then  I do think it's easy for pace and scoring to inflate our opinions of some modern players (e.g. if you took Zach LaVine's stats and put them in 2012 he'd look like the third best player in the league or something), but everything indicates that many of the guys I mentioned are having much more impact on their teams winning than, say, LaMarcus Aldridge or Kevin Love or Chris Bosh were doing in the early 2010s."
"Just to expand back to the 50’s. Obviously there’s some who could be taken off and others who can be added due to dynasties and the lack of free agent movement.

"&gt; Like no, you don't have to reiterate what I just inferred...  You are the one who seemingly cannot fathom that a team might play multiple players of the same position.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;David Robinson was an aging center at the time Timmy started playing with him. At no point in his career was Tim Duncan ever worse than David Robinson (not even his rookie season, when TD finished 5th in MVP voting).   Duncan had the significant advantage -- as I already explained to you -- of matching up with smaller forwards while playing alongside Robinson.  For just one of many examples, look at the 1999 Finals.  Since Patrick Ewing was injured, the Knicks only had Marcus Camby, Larry Johnson, and Kurt Thomas in the front court.  Camby was a world-class defender, and nearly 7 feet tall -- the other two were decidedly not.  Guess who the Knicks played Camby on?  That's right, David Robinson -- while they took their chances with two smaller, lesser players on Duncan.  &gt; annnnd you just showed your hand.   If you think figuring that out making you Sherlock Holmes, you're wrong again.  My hand wasn't hidden, and neither is the fact that Duncan is one of the most overrated players of the past several decades.  You consider 12 years of 17 points and 10 rebounds, and shooting an inefficient 49% from the field ""remarkable""?  It's really not, and that's what Duncan posted in the NBA after Robinson retired.  Few big men of that era were less efficient than Duncan -- when he wasn't able to face much smaller players on a regular basis.  But you didn't know that, either, did you?  Unsurprised.  &gt;I don't even know why I'm continuing to discuss this lmao.  Who knows, if you stick with it, maybe you'll learn something?  &gt;It's pretty common knowledge that Tim Duncan was a POWER FORWARD (and the greatest, at that).    Even the Spurs called him a center for most of his career.  As did every other team he played for, without exception.  Hell, even Popovich called Duncan their center.  &gt;*Even Spurs coach Gregg Popovich seemed to acknowledge the charade on the eve of last year’s playoff series against Utah. When asked who the Spurs would start at center, Popovich said, “Tim Duncan, like we have for the last 15 years.”*    &gt;   &gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/gregg-popovich-once-said-tim-224945080.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/gregg-popovich-once-said-tim-224945080.html)  Boy, don't you look stupid now?  The only people who think he was a forward are desperate sods like yourself who want to pretend that he was much better than he really was."
"Other than 2000 what other ones   01 pau gasol, Zach Randolph, Tont Parker, Joe Johnson, tyson chandler, Richard Jefferson, gerald wallace     02 yao ming, amare stoudemire, caron butler, nene, tayshaun prince, John salmons, Mike Dunleavy    03 is obvious    04 Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, lol deng, andre igouldala, Devin Harris, al Jefferson, Jr Smith, Josh Smith, Tony Allen    05 Cp3, Deron Williams Andrew Bynum, Andrew bogut, Danny granger, David Lee, gerald Green, nate Robinson    06 Rondo, Lowry, Aldridge, Brandon Roy, Jr Reddick, rudy gay"
"Those numbers include the players who opted out. But let's look at some 2016 all pros, which are the best players at each position. Brady, David Johnson, Leveon Bell, Greg Olsen, Odell, Antonio Brown, Kelechi Osemele, Alex Mack, Jack Conklin, Trent Williams, Khalil Mack, Vic Beasley, Jadaveon Clowney, Cameron Wake, Olivier Vernon, Damon Harrison,  Suh, Calais Campbell, Gerald Mccoy, Mosley, Zach Brown, Alec Ogletree, Benadrick Mckinney, Aqib Talib, Marcus Peters, Janoris Jenkins, Malcolm Butler, Landon Collins, Ha-Ha Clinton Fix, Chris Harris, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Marquette King, Cordarrelle Patterson, and Nate Ebner. All of those guys were all pros in 2016 and switched teams after that."
"This is a stupid point he is making only made dumber by the fact that he constantly advocates for Mark Jackson.   Side note we do see successful to mildly successful black coaches get the same chances . Some below Mike Dantoni tier coaches such as Dwayne Casey, Ty Lue, Nate McMillan, Monty Williams, J. B. Bickerstaff,Mike Brown, Maurice Cheeks, David Fitzdale, Alvin Gentry , Avery Johnson, Jason Kidd, Byron Scott, Paul Silas , have all gotten multiple opportunities  despite just being average for the most part.   The black coaches I could think of that haven’t , have been abysmal to a different level. Some that come to mind are Mark Jackson, Derek Fischer , Isiah Thomas, Keith Smart (edit: was abysmal and got multiple opportunities) , Jacque Vaughn and this is just off the top.   These are only the recent examples, go back in history and the track record is far far worse.   I can’t think of a black coach who was solid  that wasn’t given a second chance and if it happened I don’t think it happens at such a rate that it is a race issue.   The issue is more about the fact that the league just recycles coaches and rarely gives new coaches a try regardless of race."
"That was the 50-game lockout season, and expectations were high with a young Tim Duncan and healthy David Robinson. Also, Pop was highly unproven at the time. He was formerly the GM, but had fired Bob Hill and made himself the coach. There was apparent pressure from the ownership to let Doc Rivers (then an analyst for the Spurs) take over.  [The story goes that if Pop had lost one more game, he would have been canned.](https://www.ksat.com/sports/2017/12/29/what-if-gregg-popovich-was-fired-in-1999-former-spurs-players-ksats-greg-simmons-chime-in/).   Instead, Avery Johnson and Robinson rallied the Spurs around him, they won that game convincingly against the Houston Rockets, then went 30-5 the rest of the season (and of course, took home the Spurs first championship)"
"In no particular order over Malone I at least have: Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kareem, Tim Duncan, Shaq, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlain, Stephen Curry, Hakeem, Kobe, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robinson, David Robinson and Jerry West. So I don't feel he is a lock for top 15."
"*OT sorta about ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES (1992), the very first game with official NBA and NBPA licenses*:  I recently found out that I have a copy of ""Tecmo NBA Basketball"" for the NES *and* a working NES (*don't ask how I just figured this out*), so I gotta talk about this game. I don't want to discuss its gameplay because you already know it sucks. Rather I'd like to talk about the details it includes for the players (*nope, not graphically, because those are pretty generic*), chiefly their abilities. Each player's profile page ([MJ's profile as an example](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/images/22)) includes their FG%, FT%, 3FG%, and then 6 abilities: Running Speed, Jumping, Stealing, Blocking, Shooting Range, and Stamina. Those shooting percentages are from the 1990-91 season, and the rosters reflect the 1991-92 season. OK, you got the basics; time to look at this game's choices with player abilities.  * First, here is [a detailed scan of the game's front and back cover](https://www.covercentury.com/covers/nes/t/nes_tecmonbabasketball.jpg). Again, this is the first game ever with licenses from both the NBA and NBPA, so it can use all the real teams and players. It can put anyone it wants on the cover -- It was early-1992, so probably Michael Jordan, or Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or David Robinson. Look closely at the main player making the play on the cover -- that's Clipper **Loy Vaugt**. The Clippers weren't good in '91, weren't supposed to be good in '92, Vaught was a rookie of no note in '91 (*5.5 ppg, #13 pick in '90 draft*) .... I can't figure out the choice that was made here.  * Speaking of the timing of this game's release - it came out with rosters set for the 1991-92 season, including mega-star **Magic Johnson** on the Lakers. Except Magic retired in November of 1991 and never played for the '92 team. Oh well.   * **RUNNING SPEED:** The game shows you a bar graph for each player's ability, but over the years people have gone into the code and pulled out the specific number that Tecmo assigned to players' ratings ([all player ratings in the game are at this link](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587685-tecmo-nba-basketball/faqs/50445) - *scroll way down*). Ratings are out of 100, but few speeds topped 80; somehow Jeff Ruland and Magic Johnson both had an 80 speed. Ruland is a particularly egregious selection for this fast speed since he was just coming out of 4-year retirement at that point due to massive foot troubles. The fastest players in the game, with Speeds above 80, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90), Charles Barkley (90), **3)** Tim Hardaway (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), and **5)** Orlando Woolridge (81). Barkley, huh? For that matter, MJ also has no business with the best speed in the game.  * **JUMPING:** The best jumpers/leapers in the game, with Jumping above 70, are: **1)** Michael Jordan (80), Manute Bol (80), **3)** Dennis Rodman (78), Orlando Woolridge (78), **5)** Clyde Drexler (75), David Robinson (75), Hakeem Olajuwon (75), Scottie Pippen (75), Patrick Ewing (75), **10)** Elden Campbell (74), and **11)** Otis Thorpe (72). As you can see, this category sort of stands in for ""reach"" for tall centers who get lots of blocks.  * **Best Overall Athletes** in the game based on Running Speed &amp; Jumping (RS/J) are: **1)** Michael Jordan (90/80), **2)** Orlando Woolridge (81/78), **3)** Dennis Rodman (80/78), **4)** Scottie Pippen (80/75), **5)** Shawn Kemp (80/70), David Benoit (80/70), and **7)** Larry Johnson (75/70).   * **STEALING:** The best at stealing in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** Kevin Johnson (65), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (65), Michael Jordan (65), Scottie Pippen (65), Maurice Cheeks (65), Terry Porter (65), John Stockton (65), Mark Price (65), Greg Anthony (65), Michael Adams (65), **11)** Isiah Thomas (63). I'll point out that **Gary Payton** only had a rating of 45, which is oddly low, even based on the circumstances. He had just completed his rookie season in 1990-91, and his 2.0 spg were 12th best in the league despite only playing 27 mpg (*his Steal% was 5th-best in the NBA*). He had been the Pac-10 Defensive POTY and had a ridiculous amount of steals in college (*#2 in NCAA career all-time at that point*). There was both his college reputation &amp; proof as an NBA rookie that the guy was a big-time ball theft, so I'm unsure why they kept his Stealing rating as low as they did going into his 2nd season. Weirder yet, Greg Anthony graduated in '91 right before the game was developed with nearly the same amount of college steals as Payton (329 vs 321), but had no NBA success yet since he hadn't played yet, but he got the great rating (65) and Payton didn't (45).   * **BLOCKING:** The best at blocking in the game, with ability above 60, are: **1)** David Robinson (90), **2)** Hakeem Olajuwon (80), **3)** Manute Bol (75), **4)** Elden Campbell (72), **5)** Rik Smits (70), John Salley (70), Chris Dudley (70), **8)** Larry Nance (65), Mark Eaton (65), **10)** Alton Lister (62)  * **Best Overall Defensive Abilities** in the game based on having 40+ in Stealing &amp; Blocking (S/B) are: **1)** John Salley (40/70), **2)** Scottie Pippen (65/40), Shawn Kemp (45/60), **4)** Larry Johnson (50/50), Chris Gatling (45/55), **6)** A.C. Green (53/43), **7)** Reggie Lewis (50/40), Billy Owens (45/45), **9)** Tim Perry (40/45), Jerome Kersey (45/40), **11)** Tyrone Hill (40/40), David Benoit (40/40)  * **SHOOTING DISTANCE:** This isn't 3-point ability, as that's measured by 3FG%, but I think this affects how consistent a player is at hitting that 3FG% ... something like that. There are a bunch of guys with a 100 in this category, mostly 3-point specialists who it makes sense to give that top score to: Dell Curry, Reggie Miller, Craig Hodges, Dale Ellis, Glen Rice, and even Larry Bird (*plus others*). But for some reason they simply decided to give a 100 shooting distance ability to Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, as well. I guess they just wanted to game their own game however they needed to to make sure the 2 biggest superstars ended up putting up superstar stats no matter what.   * **STAMINA:** If a guard played almost every game, they probably got an 80+ stamina. Players with a stamina above 80 are: **1)** Michael Adams (90), Kevin Johnson (90), Tim Hardaway (90), John Stockton (90), Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues (90), **6)** Spud Webb (85), Terry Porter (85), Jerome ""Pooh"" Richardson (85), **9)** Sarunas Marciulionis (83), **10)** Gary Grant (81). This last one is an obvious error since Grant had played in only 65 and 44 games over the prior 2 seasons.  * **David Benoit:** You might have noticed that David Benoit is among the best athletes &amp; best overall defensive abilities. I'm as confused as you are -- sure he was a good athlete (*was in the '93 dunk contest*), but he was also an unheralded rookie in the 1991-92 season, meaning he never even played in the NBA before this game came out. He went undrafted in 1990, played in Spain for a year, then joined the Jazz. He was a decent-not-great player at Alabama at the same time as Robert Horry, but nothing he did there (*including his defensive stats*) leads anyone to believe the abilities given to him make any sense."
"Bro what? The league was always pumping out stars. 1985 - Patrick Ewing, Chris Mullin, Karl Malone, Joe Dumars. 1986 - This draft was weak but Dennis Rodman  1987 - David Robinson, Reggie Miller, Scottie Pippen 1988 - Another weak draft but it produced Mitch Richmond (Multiple All-NBA) 1989 - Shawn Kemp, Tim Hardaway 1990 - Gary Payton  1991 - Larry Johnson, Mutombo  1992 - Shaq, Alonzo Mourning, Latrell Sprewell  TL;DR: Stop letting the revisionist history fool you, the league was always filled with young stars, it’s just more blatant because of social media and the NBA’s popularity surge."

"Suns nets really has all the best storylines. Cp3 played with Harden, Blake, and Deandre Jordan. Nash, Dantoni, Amare, and  Sean marks are all 7sol suns vs the current iteration of the team. Mike James had his awful stint with the suns and we quickly cut him. Tyler Johnson had a stint with the suns and we cut him, though he left on good terms. Harden is an Arizona guy having gone to ASU.   Then the general David vs Goliath story as most been sleeping on the suns (some still are) vs the clear front runners from the beginning of the year in the nets. Even if I personally believe the suns actually stack up well if healthy. there is just a lot going on there."

Now, this wasn't bad, since Mohammed played a role in delivering the 2005 championship but then...  2005 NBA draft: New York Knicks draft David Lee with the #30 pick conveyed through the Malik Rose trade.  ----  2011: San Antonio trades George Hill to Indiana for the 15th pick (Kawhi Leonard) and the 42nd pick (Davis Bertans).  2018: San Antonio trades Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl, and a 2019 first round pick (Keldon Johnson)."

"&gt;Why does it matter?  Because you were attempting to prove the value of top 3 picks using two players were not close to top 3 picks.  &gt;We're trying to gauge the efficacy of tanking, so I think being a star player/key cog is enough. No real reason to limit it to only the best player.  The precise reason would be causation.  Does Kevin McHale ever win a title without Larry Bird?  Hell no.  He didn't even start 60% of his career games, and no one builds a team around a bench player.  Does Bird win without McHale?  Yeah, he basically did in '81.  &gt;1980: Magic, the number 1 pick in 1978, was a key cog, so yes, this counts.  1979, actually.  Little known fact, by the way, Johnson didn't lead the Lakers in assists until his 3rd season because they already had an All-star point guard in Norm Nixon.  Magic was arguably the 4th-best Laker on that '80 squad... and was also arguably the 2nd-best.  Speaking of which, I'm going to preempt most of your list here by pointing out that you are including an inapplicable era.  The league was fundamentally different in several very important respects during the Eighties and early Nineties.    First off, unrestricted free agency did not yet exist.  Tom Chambers was the first real free agent in 1988, and major free agents were rare for years past that date.  Secondly, draft picks held much lower trade values.  The Lakers did not earn the 1979 #1 pick by tanking, or even by being bad.  They received it -- along with 2 other firsts and two seconds -- as compensation for allowing New Orleans (the Jazz) to sign 33 year-old Gail Goodrich as a restricted free agent.  Goodrich played 3 unremarkable seasons for the Jazz, and suffice it say, that was one of the worst ""trades"" in NBA history.  Similarly, the Lakers did not earn the 1982 #1 with which they drafted Worthy -- they traded for it.  Boston did not earn the 1981 #3 that became McHale.  The 1980 #1 overall was traded twice before becoming Joe Barry Carroll.  Hell, the Chicago Bulls wanted to trade the '84 #3 for Jack Sikma straight-up, but Seattle said ""No thanks"".  Thirdly, most players went to college for several years, so drafting was quite a bit different, and less of a crap-shoot.  It was unheard-of, for example, to draft an Anthony Bennett with a first pick, and hope he learned how to play.  So, including those players is just inaccurate.  &gt;Still, not too different of a result than you. I think we can both agree that OP' post was misleading, since about 50% of title teams have been led by a top 3 pick, picked by that team.  In the applicable era -- of player-empowerment, the count is much more one-sided.  Since 1997 when Kobe Bryant arguably started the ""I will play where I want to"" era, you really only have the Spurs and they required two #1 overalls for several of those titles.  Or you prefer to consider the delineation between eras as 1998 -- when Jordan, one of the last undervalued high draft picks, retired -- the story remains the same.  If you have an all-time great center like David Robinson, and you still decide to tank, it can work -- if you get a Duncan, and not an Olowokandi like the Clippers did the following season.  No one outside San Antonio has pulled that off since, however."
"tbh its not that surprising for me. They had gervin and I think Larry Kenon, and James silas then Gervin and Gilmore starting out then they had alvin robertson,Johnny moore, Sean elliot, avery johnson, david robinson, tim duncan, parker and manu and kawhi and bowen.  They have been good forever"
I made one on another topic a few days ago when someone was outraged that Wade is not universally acknowledged as a top20 all-time player.  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Karl Malone * Jerry West * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Charles Barkley * Kawhi Leonard * Scottie Pippen * James Harden * Elgin Baylor * Isiah Thomas * David Robinson * Chris Paul  That's a quick and dirty top30. Who does Westbrook replace?
"Fast Eddie?  His peak was 1979-80 and 1980-81, when I was just starting to follow pro ball, so I have no memory of him as a player.    I do remember that drugs were a big problem in the NBA at the time, and part of what David Stern did to save the sport was come down hard on drug abuse. Johnson received a suspension by the NBA due to a cocaine addiction in 1987, and his life sadly spiraled downward after that."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"Good Lord, you clearly don't remember the 1992 Dream Team.  That team was so good, it didn't matter who started.  Chuck Daly and his assistants (Lenny Wilkens from the NBA and Mike Krzyzewski and P.J. Carlesimo from the college ranks) were most concerned about spreading out the minutes among all the great players.  According to the aforementioned book, Daly identified seven players who he thought were most important for the success of the Dream Team.  Author Jack McCallum stated those seven players, in decreasing order of importance, were Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, Chris Mullin, Karl Malone, and Patrick Ewing (page 71).  Here's an article that also discusses Daly's opinion of Pippen on the Dream Team: https://www.basketballnetwork.net/chuck-daly-on-why-scottie-pippen-was-the-best-player-on-the-original-dream-team-during-the-1992-olympics/."
"You said I hate him for his cornrows, implying I'm racist.     Michael Jordan   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   LeBron James   Magic Johnson   Hakeem Olajuwan   Bill Russell   Kobe Bryant   Larry Bird   Tim Duncan   Shaquille O'Neal   Wilt Chamberlain   David Robinson   Charles Barkley   Moses Malone   Karl Malone   Isiah Thomas   Patrick Ewing   Oscar Robertson   Dirk Nowitzki   Dwyane Wade   John Stockton   Kevin Garnett   Jerry West   Julius Erving   Kevin Durant   Steve Nash   Chris Paul   Scottie Pippen   Stephen Curry\[  Elgin   Hondo    Who is he better than?"
"That 1992 Dream Team had Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, and Christian Laettner. Nine top 50 players of all time, 11 Hall of Famers, and Christian Laettner just brings mercy bench warmer (which should of been Shaq). These days the gap is closer, but for the World to be competitive against US would be only College players can participate."
"No surprise, vegan diets give you the lean muscle required for endurance and speed.      Running back David Johnson admitted he was faster on a vegan diet. But he switched back to meat because he kept on getting injured from all those tackles."
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
"Karl Malone would guard David Robinson his entire career, nephew.   James worthy has played PF, look it up.   shawn kemp and larry johnson were no joke.   Larry Bird, ever hear of him?  Barkley, ever hear of him?  Plenty of other great bigs/forwards during Malones run."
did you just name karl malone as competition for karl malone?  david robinson was a center  james worthy was a small forward  shawn kemp and larry johnson are not ATGs LOL  you had a better argument with the PGs
"Karl Malone, Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp, David Robinson, James Worthy, even Larry Bird was still balling when Karl Malone was. Plenty great players were in the 80s and 90s era at the forward position lol what are you on."

"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"
"""A 2nd, a 4th and David Johnson"""
"Does he need to be talked about more? There's A LOT of former NBA players who don't get talked about, and why should they? We have a ton of active NBA players to talk about right now instead? Does David Robinson need to be talked about more? Pat Ewing? Moses Malone? Joe Dumars? Dennis Johnson? Willis Reed?"
"Part of my original childhood fascination with the game was marveling at the 92 Dream Team.   Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Clyde Drexler, Scottie Pippen, Chris Mullin, and Christian Laettner.  Fucking bananas."
"Its bad enough that after 10+ years I am no longer a Texans fan. I guess its easier to move on as a person with zero connections to Houston or Texas. But I have a lot of their gear and spent a lot of time watching their games including missing out on doing my passion (rock climbing) on a lot of Sundays which is typically a great day to go out and climb. I did not sign up to be the fan of a team that puts religion ahead of good football and then runs all your favorite players out of town (including trading them for a bunch of bullshit) because they aren't religious or don't bow down to a fucking pastor with zero football expertise. Also you can look at a lot of the recent signings/people they traded for a see something in common with them all...they are all very religious. David Johnson, Cooks, Culley, etc."
"If you're a Knicks fan you should be even more upset about the 1997 playoffs when an even worse version of this happened in the Knicks-Heat series. The Knicks were up in the series 3-1 and at the end of Game 5, PJ Brown literally picked up and body slammed Charlie Ward as Ward was boxing him out for a rebound. Naturally a bunch of Knicks players ran in to protect Ward. Some of them left the bench, including Patrick Ewing-- who never made physical contact with a Heat player but just strolled out to halfcourt watching the madness unfold beneath the basket at the other end of the court.  PJ Brown was suspended for Games 6 and 7, but was the only Heat player suspended. The Knicks had so many players suspended that they had to spread them out over Games 6 and 7 to give them enough players to field a playable roster in both games. Ewing, Ward, and Allan Houston were suspended for Game 6, and Larry Johnson and John Starks were suspended for Game 7. This basically ensured the Knicks would lose both games and the series.   Ewing, Houston, Johnson, Starks, and Ward were 5 of the team's top 7 players in minutes played that season. In Game 6 without Ewing and Houston, Johnson and Starks put up 20-9-3 and 15-11-5, but it wasn't enough. In Game 7 without Johnson and Starks, Ewing and Houston put up 37-17-4 and 25-1-6, but it wasn't enough.   What really makes it extra unfortunate is that that was probably the best team Ewing ever played on. He was still at the tail end of his prime at 34 years old, and for the first time in his career had a roster with several talented offensive options (Houston and Johnson were a pretty strong 2nd and 3rd option combo, and Starks in his new role coming off the bench won 6th man of the year). After a slow start the team won 57 games and was peaking going into the playoffs, sweeping a very strong 54-win Hornets team in the first round and breaking out to a 3-1 series lead against a 61-win Heat team before a poor Game 5 and ultra-handicapped Games 6 and 7.  Realistically, that team likely would have lost to Jordan's Bulls in the next round, but I'm convinced they would have given the Bulls as strong a run as any other team did during the 2nd threepeat, and they were playing so well that they had a realistic, if slim, chance of pulling it off. So yeah. David Stern single-handedly denied Ewing's last and perhaps best chance to take down Jordan. Ewing had a severe wrist injury the following season and was never the same player afterwards."
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"Going 2000 to 2006 gets you Lebron, Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, Joe Johnson, Jason Terry, Mike Dunleavy, and Andrew Bynum. I didn't do every combination but that's a helluva start.  Just looking at good consecutive #1 picks, Building around 92 and 93 gets you...  89 - Stacey King 90 - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Rumeal Robinson 91 - Billy Owens 92 - Shaquille O'Neal 93 - Chris Webber 94 - Eddie Jones  There's some combinations that gets you Michael Jordan at #3 and either Brad Daugherty and Patrick Ewing or Brad Daugherty and David Robinson. Whoever is the best combination of the other #3 pick and the best guy you get with the #10's and #6 has to be decent."

"&gt; ESTABLISHING A PLAYER-OWNER PARTNERSHIP Following a new three-year collective bargaining agreement (which included increases in the minimum salary, elimination of no-trade agreements in player contracts in 1980) and Silas' resignation as union head in order to become coach of the San Diego Clippers, financial health of the league became a major concern. Numerous franchises suffered from serious losses, headed by Cleveland, Denver, Indiana, Kansas City, San Diego and Utah. Some, including Kansas City and San Diego, nearly provoked a player strike in 1982 as they fell behind on their deferred payments to former players, as the league totaled an estimated $80 million to $90 million in deferred money owed to players. With the very real threat of the loss of franchises and player jobs, the union, now led by its new president Bob Lanier, agreed to a new four-year collective bargaining agreement in March of 1983 after strained negotiations and the threat of a player strike. The agreement was ground breaking for professional sports as it included:  &gt; - a salary cap guarantying the players between 53% and 57% of the NBA's gross revenues (gate receipts, local and national television and radio revenue and preseason and postseason revenue) -$500,000 a year in licensing revenue -a guarantee that the league will maintain 253 player jobs even if there is a reduction in the number of teams  &gt; The 1983 agreement would prove to be a major turning point for the league. An amendment later in the year which implemented the NBA's first league-wide substance abuse policy, proved to be a big step in cleaning up the league's image problems, and brilliant young players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan excited the fans. &gt; The financial well-being of the league improved under Commissioner David Stern, who assumed the position in 1984, but in 1987 the owners and players clashed over the salary cap, right of first refusal and college draft. Following a brief signing moratorium and a failed attempt at an antitrust suit by a player group headed by NBPA President Junior Bridgeman of Milwaukee, and the threat of union decertification, an agreement on a six-year collective bargaining agreement is reached, including:""   NBA literally led to player cap space rights pretty much across north american sports. Quite literally the opposite of the NFLPA."
"&gt;No one that's ever watched them play has ever said David Robinson is better than Tim Duncan.   For just one of so many counter examples, why did the Knicks put DPOY Marcus Camby on Robinson in the '99 Finals, and take their chances with Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas -- both decidedly not DPOY -- on Duncan?  Why did Robinson's numbers drop when Duncan arrived, but Duncan's numbers dropped when Robinson left?  The fact is that Robinson was better at every facet of basketball -- scoring, shooting, rebounding, passing, defending, everything.  Go ahead and try to argue otherwise.  I've been over this a hundred times, and you will lose.  &gt;You should honestly delete your account and go watch full length Spurs games if you believe that.  I watched them both play in college -- Robinson was miles better.  I watched them both play in the Olympics -- Duncan embarrassed his entire country in unprecedented fashion.  I watched them both play in the NBA -- Robinson was superior in every respect, except he didn't have better teammates.  I'm quite sure I know exactly of what I speak, thanks."
"I am not sure how you are going to guarantee 80% but okay here are 10 players…  Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker, David Robinson, Robert Horry, Avery Johnson, Brent Barry, Matt Bonner, Bruce Bowen, Michael Finley, and just for fun Giannis.   I am excited to see how you guarantee this."

"Even at his peak, Sabonis was not better than Johnson and Bird. An out of college David Robinson held his own against him in the Olympics, that roster just wasn't good enough to beat that combined Soviet team."
"KD is the evolutionary Iceman George Gervin  Luka to James Harden (if not just because they didn't give him some random European white guy like Pablo Prigioni)  Lebron is Magic Johnson + David Robinson (maybe not the best comp, but a pretty unique one that had me thinking)  Michael Jordan to Jesus Christ"
"2/8 shooting isnt too concerning, one possession counted for like 3 shots form which we got free throws. Not ideal but it's fine.   What's more frustrating is how he just wasnt aggressive enough on offense. When he bought the ball up and looked to drive hard he got fouled most of the time. But most of the time he just decides to give it to like David Johnson or Banton lol.   Also I feel he coulda converted some of those lay ups he got fouled on. Overall he defo wasnt at his best but over the 2 games I've liked what I've seen especially on defense.   He was legit good in the second half when he saw the floor but he got benched a lot, especially when he sat like 9 mins in the 4th like wtf"

David Johnson would be another for the Raptors. He was considered to be lottery talent for a while
"&gt;So you only like counting stats.. cool  Learn to read.  &gt;Even Spurs fans would say Duncan is better...  And they are wrong.  Just like Laker fans who think Bryant was better than Johnson.  &gt;you must be thinking 2009-2016 Duncan when he was washed  The fact that you just had to call him washed for over 1/3rd of his career is telling enough.  You might should try not arguing against yourself.  &gt;still effective and great at defense  In actual fact, Duncan was only effective for a few years alongside Robinson -- who not coincidentally attracted the lion's share of defensive attention -- and he was never great defensively.  Without Robinson, Duncan is basically Kevin Willis with slightly better defense.  &gt;The type of person who has Kobe in thier top 5 also says the admiral is better than Duncan.  This is wrong as well.  Bryant is not even a Top 5 Laker, but the only reason Duncan is even the second-best San Antonio big is because Artis Gilmore only played there briefly.  The same people overrate Bryant and Duncan, because they fail to realize that both were inefficient scorers, and offensive players in general, with undeserved and inaccurate defensive reputations, who rode the coattails of others to five rings.  David Robinson was better at absolutely every part of playing basketball, compared to Tim Duncan, and there's no supportable argument otherwise.  Feel free to attempt it -- I've challenged many to do so, and no one can."

"He was one of the top 5 or so guys from the combine based on the Woo article. Maybe stellar was the wrong word, but definitely standout and all those guys moved up in the draft while others dropped because they didn't do as well or didn't show up at all. Now Spurs can to put him through their development cycle so I am happy with that.   He doesn't have to be better than the other Spurs guards right now. He's still so young. He can still get bigger. Keldon Johnson has grown since they drafted him. David Robinson was 6'6 at 18. Not that I think he'll be 7 foot, but he has potential to see physical growth too. I'm happy with it.   Spurs have a solid scouting / FO program and development team, so they definitely saw something and he checked off a lot of boxes.  They definitely see something more in him than Sengun, probably on the athletic defensive wing side of things. Wright also made note of him playing PG in addition to position-less."

There’s 3 that come to mind  2011 Derick Rose 1973 David Cowens 1989 Magic Johnson
"Just some old players off the top of my head:  Hakeem:  Had hero-ball tendencies and questionable shot selection, especially earlier in his career.    David Robinson:  Much of his offensive game relied on his athleticism + strength, which is why he wrecked things up in the regular season but ran into problems in the playoffs.  He didn't have a resilient move-set like Hakeem to counter elite big-men defenders.  Karl Malone:  Had a relatively small weak span which hurt his finishing abilities  It also meant he couldn't be a defensive anchor despite having all the other qualifies of an elite defensive big man.  Magic Johnson:  Regarded as the worst defender out of all the numerous ""GOAT"" players.  Too slow to guard small guys and he was too ""small"" to defend big guys.    Larry Bird:  Injuries + lack of athleticism hurt his scoring ability to attack the rim which might explain some of his up-and-down playoff performances.  Shaq:  Besides the obvious, he had a pretty low motor on defense due to his size and offensive load so he would camp below the basket.  Was still an asset on defense because of the era and the fact he was a good deterrent with his rim protection, but he definitely struggled when pulled out.  Tim Duncan:  No mid-range shot.  I think he has like a 40% FG% on midrange shots or something.  Scottie Pippen: Mediocre shooter.  He is what people wished Ben Simmons became.  Charles Barkley:  Classic tweener on defense.  Not athletic enough to guard small guys and not big enough to defend well in the post.  Also shot too many three pointers.  Michael Jordan:  Super hero-ball tendencies in his early career.  Stopped when Phil Jackson came along and turned him into a supreme play maker."
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
"You mean the Spurs team with Duncan, David  robinson, sean Elliot,  del negro, Avery Johnson?

What the actual fuck is wrong with you?"
"I have him at 12 but he’s a top 10 talent.  I’d argue only Wilt, Kareem, Jordan, and LeBron are definitely better than him as a talent.  He’s in the same category as Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, and Hakeem as a talent but doesn’t have the legacy those guys do.    As an aside, Russell is super underrated by people claiming he’s only be a Dennis Rodman / Draymond Green type of player but he isn’t the same talent as those guys above.  Russell has the better legacy because he was like Jordan and Kobe in his mentality and played team ball instead of superstar iso ball and was an athletic freak of nature like David Robinson, Magic Johnson, prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Julius Erving, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."

"I think they do provide more value early on though.  For example, of the four I mentioned, Chris Johnson, David Johnson, Todd Gurley, and Leveon Bell, there are 8 All-Pro appearances.  And they'll never make another appearance again.  Of those 8 appearances, all of them were on rookie contracts.  They get their values artificially deflated for 4 years and then by the time those years are done, they aren't that good anymore.  Gurley got lucky though and signed a good extension before it was clear that he wasn't that good anymore."
"Totally agree, given the way the majority of running back careers play out, I think it's clear they need a specific salary structure that lets them get paid more earlier compared to other positions.  Chris Johnson, David Johnson, Todd Gurley, Leveon Bell, the list goes on.  These guys have 2-3 elite years and then their bodies give out."

"Raptors: David Johnson  Hawks: Jalen Johnson &amp; Sharife Cooper   For the Raptors, Johnson is actually really interesting because he was actually mocked in the late lottery-first round range before Louisville hit a COVID pause in February and his efficiency tanked after.  I’m shocked he’s on a two way because he’s a pretty good prospect    For the Hawks, Johnson and Cooper are just two of the most talented player of the draft, but both probably won’t be able to find minutes his year (which isba food problem to have). Johnson’s a 6-9 forward with a great athleticism and passing but I actually think it’s good if he gets G league mins year 1 because he has been missing alot of games in his development (Injured at Duke and often in high school, in order for dev it makes more sense for him to play G league than 10 NBA mins) and Cooper had a first round grade in every mock/big board. Should be a cool year for both teams"
"Lamarcus Aldridge, Marbury, David West, Tyson Chandler, Joe Johnson, Matrix"
"I mean that goes almost 180 degrees away from what everyone in the raptors organization has been saying so idk how much I believe that. We also don’t have a backup SG that we need to prioritize over him. Our starting lineup is FVV/GTJ/OG/Siakam/Birch with Flynn/Barnes/Precious being the only young players of note. It’d be different if we had Suggs but outside of David Johnson (who’ll most likely be in the G league) and Svi, no one else is there to prioritize at backup 2"
Wrong David Johnson 😭
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."

"David Khan + Rambis was the darkest days, Add in a dash of Rashad ""the Kardashians ruined my career"" McCants and missing on EVERY draft pick. (instead of Cousins we got Wes Johnson, instead of Curry we got Flynn, instead of Tristian Thompson or Kemba we got Derrick Williams)"
"I think so.   Look for PG: We got Vanvleet, Dragic, and Flynn, now I don’t have to explain why Vanvleet is great. Flynn is a good backup and someone who can pick up key minutes while resting Vanvleet. And Dragic is questionable since it’s possible Masai would wanna trade him or something but again, promising vet who brings in that Heat mentality of defence and rough play.   SG: Gary Trent, he’s a dawg. Like a bulldog, he’s great offensively and if Nurse can bring a very strong defending curve into his game (reason why he signed a 3year deal because he wants to ball out and bag an even bigger contract after his deal’s done), David Johnson, a two way player is a developing rookie but the best thing about guards are that all of them are interchangeable except Gary Trent. Vanvleet, Flynn, and Dragic can all create their own shots and playmaking is good.  SF: OG, Gillespie, Banton (OG is AMAZING defensively) Banton and Gillespie are promising due to their size and Gillespie plays Center but you can try to put a squad out there for resting minutes with your last backup as Gillespie as well.   PF: Probably the most exciting position on the squad because we got some titans like Siakam, Scottie Barnes (which yes doesn’t have a great shooting production due to his jumpers but man can run and defend), and ofc interchangeably Boucher as PF as well because this kid is freaking amazing.   C: Thank god we have Khem Birch, Boucher, and Precious, Gillespie. Arguably one of the most underrated Centers squad on a team. They all have great and different skills which can be used in different situations.  Other people like Wainright, Watanabe (great development last year), and new addition Bonga are so vital to this team as well.   So yes, I think they are very underrated partially because the most star players we have is Siakam and Freddy.   As long as Nurse’s diverse coaching rolled in with the squad that Masai is rebuilding with I can def see us making the playoffs and upsetting at least one team.  Idc who Raptors play, defending is going to be elite. Plus, the biggest thing is Raptors can play at Scotiabank Arena, because getting booed in Tampa rolled in Covid really did not do them any good."

"&gt; To the best of my knowledge, we haven't seen a true all-seven footers lineup but not for lack of trying.  We saw a few teams in the late 90s and early 00s try starting 3 posts, but that's about as close as we've gotten.  The craziest was in 1998 I think, when the Spurs would play Triple Towers of Tim Duncan, Will Perdue, and David Robinson while the Suns were trying out triple PG lineups of Steve Nash, Kevin Johnson, and Jason Kidd. Meaning we had a few moments were Kidd and Duncan were both effectively the SF and guarding each other."
"In no order, Dame, Sheed, Larry Johnson, David Robinson, Hakeem"
"he's 6'4 and he's 6'6 depending on if we're going barefoot or w/ shoes like the guy said  &gt;For instance: Patrick Ewing, a 7-footer for the Knicks, is listed here as 6 feet 10 inches. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, both 6-9 during their entire careers, have mysteriously shrunk to 6-7. **Michael Jordan, 6-6 in Chicago, is a 6-4 Olympian**. According to the roster, there is no 7-footer on this team, as David Robinson, 7-1 at home, is really 6-11.

"Shaq and Hakeem Olajuwon were both in the league when Jordan won those MVPs and titles, they were both better than any player in the league today.  Alongside them the league also had: Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Dominique Wilkins, Mitch Richmond, Kevin Johnson and many others that i didn't mention.  The NBA had insane talent in the 90s, the same way it has today, the difference now is that there are more players from other countries that are top players aswell, also in the 90s players weren't stacked in one team like they are today (i.e Lakers and Nets)."
"Scouting+Development Team.  If you watch Open Gym (and I have some friends employed by Raptors too), they like guys who have a good physical specimen and also strong work ethic. They think the other things can all be worked on. Look at all the guys we've drafted and the one constant has been they are all hard workers.  Dalano wasn't seen as even being picked at all in the draft but my internal sources tell me that the FO was enamored with his work ethic. We haven't seen much of David Johnson yet either but apparently he's a gym rat too. Masai saw both of those picks as being viewed as the steals of the draft 4 years from now due to work ethic+our developmental team.  A developmental team doesn't mean anything if the player has no work ethic."
We got three.  Didn't you see the way David Johnson dribbled the time out at the end of the game????
Fuck your David Johnson erasure
David Johnson is dead to OP.
DAVID JOHNSON SIGHTING
"I can give you 30 other guys from the 70s in the NBA alone (not including the ABA) that were clearly better and more impactful than Bing.  Kareem, Walton, Lanier, Unseld, Reed, Debusshere, Dandridge, Frazier, Monroe, Gus Johnson, Gus Williams, Rick Barry, Billy Cunningham, Dennis Johnson, Elvin Hayes, McAdoo, Maurice Lucas, Oscar Robertson's last years, Jerry West's last years, Wilt's last year, Dr. J's intro to the NBA, Randy Smith, Artis Gilmore, David Thompson, George Gervin, John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, Jojo White, Jim Chones.  There. 30 guys who anyone around in the 70s would have said made more of an impact on their teams than Dave Bing did."
James Johnson is highly trained and claps every other player. After that it might be Shaq and David Robinson. Shaq has had usbstantial training and Robinson probably learned a bit in the military

"Not really. Since the lottery, Ewing took the Knicks to multiple conference finals and 2 finals, David Robinson took the Spurs to a conference finals and won 50 games like every year, Shaq took the Magic to the finals, Iverson took the Sixers to the finals, Duncan got the Spurs 5 rings, Lebron took the Cavs to the finals, Dwight took the Magic to the finals, Rose took the Bulls to multiple conference finals. Those are all franchise altering players. Then you’ve also got great players like Derrick Coleman, Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Glenn Robinson, Elton Brand, Yao Ming, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and KAT.   If you want to be relevant, then getting the number one pick is an easy way to do that. Far easier than trying to develop project players late in the draft like Giannis or getting big time free agents that only 2 franchises can actually get reliably"
"David Robinson is indisputably top 10 because of his defense.   I’d start a team with him over Bird, Johnson, or Kobe. That’s my criteria. Not rings."
"“When the Bulls, behind Michael Jordan, won the 1991 NBA Finals and were invited to the White House to visit President George H.W. Bush, Hodges wanted to bring more than his smile. Rather the customary suit and tie, he chose traditional African garb. He also wished to solicit executive assistance in addressing Chicago’s steep murder rate.  The NBA of the 1990s, with the late David Stern as commissioner, was rising in popularity in the wake of drug issues that plagued it in the ‘80s. Magic Johnson and Bird were aging, but Jordan had arrived and was ready to eclipse them both. Attendance was up. TV contracts were more lucrative. The league was going global.  The fear was that any sign of political dissent, racial awakening or social unrest would be damaging, perhaps irreparably. The NBA and its superstars were unwilling to let anyone, particularly a role-playing specialist like Hodges, jeopardize its ascent.”  I found this in an article that summed it up pretty good."

I think it might’ve been that rookie David Johnson cause he was delayed getting to Toronto compared to Barnes/Banton but that could’ve been passport/visa issues. Gary Trent is also a possibility heard his dad posts nutty shit on IG all the time.
"Stephen A this is why you get for removing the superior debator on the show. Max knows more boxing than stephen knows basketball but Max also knows more basketball than stephen a knows basketball.   &amp;#x200B;  Me personally I believe Max was removed because Stephen A didnt like the fact that Max defines greatness from a different perspective than the old folks. Max kept saying that kd rings meant nothing while stephen a was calling kd the best player in the world because of his rings. I believe very soon Max would start to say ""If you look at MJ's teammates and what he achieved with them a lot of other players would have won just as many rings..."" And I would agree with him because in reality the greatest of all time list should look something like Hakeem Olajuwon, Giannis Antetoukompo, Shaquille Oneal, Lebron James, David Robinson, kevin Durant but it at the moment its MJ, LBJ, Kareem, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kobe. The first list is based on who are the greatest players of all time while the popular list the second list is a nostalgic list based on who was the best player on the best team and who had the most rings.  &amp;#x200B;  The way goats are seen nowadays is stupid and Max kellerman is trying to change the narrative and bring forth reality. People call Brady the goat even though Aaron Rodgers is better but never had the better team, People call Mj the goat even though Hakeem Olajuwon was better than Michael Jordan but hakkem did not have the luxury of scottie Pippen and Dennis rodman. MJ sixth option on the bulls was better than hakeem second option. You see the goat argument that is used nowadays is nostalgic mixed with feelings and little bit of ignorance.   &amp;#x200B;  Stephen A will regret his decision forever but the truth will come out no matter what!"
"I think you are right (unfortunately) a lot of the time, but I don't think its fairly to blindly judge a religious person for their faith.

But you might be able to trade David Johnson for DeAndre Hopkins

"You said it yourself, Stockton was a better defender, and although Nash was better offensively, defense matters a lot, also, longevity.   The argument against Stockton having Malone also means he didn’t have to shoot as much, he could have been a better scorer if he had to do it, not as good as Nash, but he was still a career 51/38/82 shooter, with amazing playmaking skills and vision and good defense.   Nash played in a weak era, to be honest, he would have had 0 MVPs if he played against MJ in his prime, Olajuwon, Shaq, Malone, David Robinson, Magic Johnson. So, the accolades argument doesn’t make much sense to me. The same for the no ring argument, Stockton had Malone, but Nash never had to go against teams with arguably the GOAT player in the finals."
"I think they would better embid in olajuwan,   Better zion in Charles Barkley,   a pick and roll demon in Karl Malone with more floor spacing.

"It was Cwebb, now I’d say maybe Billups.  STAT was an mvp caliber guy in NY one year and was great for Phoenix.

Throwback Andrew Toney the Boston strangler.  Joe Johnson was one of my all time favs hope he makes the Hall at some point.  Mark Aguirre bad boy Piston is not in the hall despite an awesome college career and really really good nba career  Andre Miller also one of those guys for even how remarkable his career was has no shot at the HOF but deserves to be remembered by fans  At the time in the mid 00’s I think most people would’ve assumed that Rasheed Wallace would make the hall before Ben Wallace but that did not happen  Human highlight reel Shawn Kemp is not in  Just some names that don’t belong in the Hall but deserve a shout out, Derek Fisher, Gerald Wallace, Shane Battier, Kyle Korver, Marcus Camby, Danny Granger, David West, Andrei Kirlienko, Mehmet Okur, Nikola Pekovic, Josh Smith, Gerald Green.

Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokić	7.45   4.	Kevin Durant	6.44   5.	Stephen Curry	6.37   6.	Tracy McGrady\*	6.17   7.	Magic Johnson\*	6.08   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.42   9.	Larry Bird\*	5.40   10.	Kawhi Leonard	5.35   11.

Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."
"no order: LeBron, Durant, Kawhi, PG, Butler, Worthy, T-Mac, Bird, Dr J, Wilkins, Gervin, King, Pierce, Peja, Pippen, Havlicek, Baylor, Melo, English, Dantley, Hill, Rice, Barry, Artest, Joe Johnson. That's 25 that are very obviously better than Middleton. Then you have a tier with Iggy, Marion, and a ton of old timers like Aguirre, Blackman, Arizin, Mullin, David Thompson, Vandewhghehe or whatever, and a whole bunch of other guys that I simply don't know enough about to rank.  I could buy Middleton as a top 50 SF, maybe top 40, probably not top 30."
Thanks for the David Johnson heads up guys. Put in a fix lol
This is fun lol. There's a bug tho with David Johnson [here](https://i.imgur.com/A0jeEjV.jpg)
I don’t know why David Johnson doesn’t get more credit for his WWII-the present longevity
"Yeah, tried to connect Dolph Schayes to LeBron and it went to David Johnson again"
"nice job, but you should not allow two players of the same name to interfere with each other. Use a unique player key rather than something with their names in it. This was the first thing I tried: https://i.imgur.com/scC6yzy.png  it mixed up a 2021 David Johnson for a 1949 David Johnson"
"It's not perfect, I tried connecting Scottie Barnes to Wilt Chamberlain and it told me raptors rookie David Johnson played in the 1950s"

"For real, when we drafted him, I thought he would be in the G-League with David Johnson.  He's completely exceeded my expectations so far."
"James Johnson, David West, Haslem"

"Literally every time I watch the 76ers I think this at least 10 times throughout the game.  It's annoying, honestly. Just the fact that the thought intrudes so often because of how bad it was.  Better than David Johnson for Deandre Hopkins I guess, Texas has that going for 'em. Oh, wait."

"Magic Johnson 32, David Robinson 50, Peja 16"
"Damn, I guess David Johnson is gonna have to settle with the Finals MVP."
Then-Cardinals RB David Johnson dislocated his wrist a couple years ago week 1 and was out for the whole year. I was so worried about this when they ruled out Pat with a wrist injury. Big loss
