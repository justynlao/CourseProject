"Tomas Satoransky   (Healthy) Otto Porter   Avery Bradley   Steven Adams  Jae Crowder   Sato and Otto are generally productive, though they haven't consistently been part of winning teams. That could change this season though, depending on how the Bulls play throughout the season.  Bradley, Adams, and Crowder have each played as starters on good teams. Maybe not as productive this season, but definitely last season and previous ones too."
&gt; If we figure out turnovers and even get mediocre defense  Sounds like you're waiting for the return of Tomas Satoransky...
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Junior, Denzel Valentine, Tomas Satoransky, Patrick William, Gafford (idk his first name)"
"How about Tomas Satoransky and a future 2nd? Seems like the Pelicans won’t match any offer with Lonzo, while the Bulls haven’t really shown their hand with Lauri."

"The scoring isn't empty, he's efficient. He's not a good defender, despite his improvements, and neither is most of the starting lineup so his net rating is often poor. Coby and Lauri play terrible defense so it's on Wendell Carter Jr. and Pat Williams to hold down the fort which is a precarious situation at best.      We have a deep roster so we've got guys like Thad Young, Garret Temple, Otto Porter Jr., and Tomas Satoransky coming off the bench as  second stringers and they often have much better +/- than Zach.      Our best lineups seem to be when we mix those 2nd unit vets with Zach and one of our other starters (not named Coby). However, the FO is focused on seeing the young core get minutes to evaluate who stays and who goes. Which means we're giving up more points and scoring less consistently, and taking a few more L's than we would if we were dead set on winning."

"Tomas ""Alex Caruso"" Satoransky"
"I think almost all young guys besides Luka and Trae have to improve as a playmaker and reading defenses. Donovan Mitchells started doing it and he's in the top 10 for MVP. And hard agree on all the Fournier takes. Hes got a little French in his game and reads the floor well, like Diaw and Batum. Was a stud in the Olympics a while back.   My main critique of the Celtics FO is the Walker acquisition. He is not a player who fits in that system. He was all iso and pnr in Charlotte, who had some ungodly low number of his field goals being assisted. Kinda weird but a Terry Rozier or a Tomas Satoransky is who they need in that slot. a combo guard who can be a secondary creator but is also a deadly floor spacer and defender. Not a pure scoring point like Kemba. Having Smart at the 2 compounds this even more imo because he's not a bad initiator but can't space for Kemba and he's a ball stopper sometimes (though he makes the right passes a decent bit too)."
"Bulls will reluctantly trade Felicio, a top 55 protected second, and the best European playmaker of all time, Tomas Satoransky, for this random Slovenian guy"
I know I already said this but I still cannot wrap my head around Ernie Grunfeld actually thinking keeping Tomas Satoransky would help the wizards more instead of Bojan
Protect  -Patrick Williams  -Coby White  -Thaddeus Young  -Zach Lavine  -Nikola Vucevic   -Daniel Theis  -Troy Brown JR  - Tomas Satoransky
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
"Big Papi is a slam dunk hall of famer. No one with 500 home runs has failed to qualify without serious steroid issues.   Baseball fans argue about who should be in the Hall because the standards for evaluating players have completely changed in the last 15 years of the sport, and it’s caused some players’ careers to be viewed very differently by different generations of fans. Imagine if someone came up with a totally different way to quantify passing value and it told you that Tomas Satoransky or some similar journeyman was secretly a top ten passer all time (I do not think this, for the record, but I think it’s pretty much what’s happened with Kenny Lofton and his base running). There’d be a lot of skeptics still, and getting him recognition would be tough and lead to lots of arguments."
hell yeah I've been hoping the hawks would trade trae for tomas satoransky for ages. It's like they dont even realize he's tall!
"If only we were more like Tomas Satoransky, noted tough guy"
"If they still had a few lottery picks to throw around I could see it. But I think the best offer they could make without gutting the team would be PatWil/Coby White/Tomas Satoransky plus 2025,2027 1sts. Think the Blazers could get a better offer"
"Not the highest on sengun either, for me I don’t question his bust potential I think he’ll be an NBA player I question how much of his stuff is really going to translate and how impactful it’ll be. I think him being a roll man will work, being a passer out the short roll will work, posting up mismatches and backups will work. Other than that I’m not sure. On defense he’s not big enough to defend 5’s and is bad at defending the PnR, he’s better as a help defender 4 but he’s not athletic enough to play there. I don’t buy the shot, don’t trust the ball handling stuff and I don’t think the post ups will generate enough PPP to go to it unless he’s a bench scoring option.   I’ve said it before I see a Montrezl Harrell type where he’s going to be getting buckets off the bench where his defensive ?’s and size won’t hurt a team as bad.  With Giddey I just think he’s a bad fit for us and we’re a bad fit for him in terms of roster construction and the way he plays. If we move Derrick or Dejounte then pick up Giddey to be our offensive engine I’d be on board but his play style is just so boom or bust like.   Josh Giddey is one of the 3 best passers in this draft, can make any pass imaginable, and is amazing out the pick and roll, but he  only knows 2 offensive sets those being the high pick and roll, or attack in transition. He’s only effective will the ball in his hands. He relies on his gravity as a jumbo playmaker and finisher to score and generate points which is fine but the man isn’t explosive, a real shooting threat, and can’t score off the dribble or in isolation to warrant him being a teams offensive engine. Without a shot teams will go under him, and off ball he’ll  essentially be useless since he’s also not a cutter. (A little similar to how teams just realized they could simply shrink the floor against us) His North/South change of pace needs to improve, he also needs to improve his handle. Without a dribbling package he’ll never be able to score off the dribble, or attack 1 on 1 matchups against guards 4-5 inches shorter than him due to the deficiencies as a quick twitch athlete . (This is a given for every team except us apparently) You have to get floor spacers around him and a big that can put pressure on defenses whether it be by finishing or floor spacing to open up the floor and give him room to work and operate because the man is great at getting the ball to guys who have a clear chance to score.  To me the simplicity of his game despite him being a High IQ player is his biggest weakness. I think his swing skills, primarily shooting, scoring out the Pick and Roll and ball handling will be the difference between him being Tomas Satoransky and an allstar level lead guard."

"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
"Nah, you’re right, just no way they could ever compete against the juggernaut that is Tomas Satoransky, my guy is so good that he didn’t even need any other NBA players to beat them."
"Over Coby White and Tomas Satoransky?  Yeah, he is."

Wizards legend Tomas Satoransky
"Tomas Satoransky, can you play this well for us too?"
"If Dame wants out do the blazers blow it up completely?  Maybe the Blazers want young assets?  Disclaimer I realize this isn’t the best offer the blazers could get, but its just the best i think the Bulls can offer so i’m throwing it out there.  Bulls can offer:  Patrick Williams Coby White Troy Brown Jr Tomas Satoransky Al Farouq Aminu Future first?  Why the blazers do it:  Patrick Williams is a promising young player, a lotto pick and the 2nd youngest in the nba before the draft.  Star potential.  Coby is another player with star potential who may have been held back by playing next to Lavine.  TBJ is a sweetner as a decent young prospect and the rest are salary fillers   Why the Bulls do it: Sucks to trade Williams, but you can’t acquire superstars without giving up something.  Dame is a top pg in this league and you hope putting him next to Lavine and Vucevic is enough to become contenders.  You cut 4 mill salary with this move too so you can attempt to keep Thaddeus Young as a valuable glue guy and maybe re-sign Theis to become your starting PF."
"Hey Portland I’ll give you 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 pick swaps, pick 38, 2025 and 2027 and 2029 firsts, Coby white, Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky, Al Farouq Aminu, rights to Marko saminovic, and anything else?"
WE WILL RALLY AROUND TOMAS SATORANSKY AND PLAY GOOD BASKETBALL
"Bulls will trade Coby White, Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky, and a first round pick (if i was GM)"
"Lavine. Dude’s had Coby White, Tomas Satoransky  and Kris Dunn as his point guards since he got to Chicago. Ball and Derozan are huge playmaking upgrades. Plus add the attention Vuc and Derozan will take away from him. He averaged 27 PPG on like 63% TS. That efficiency is about to go up even further."
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
"He literally wasn’t the first to report any of this considering the entire article is a compilation of reports. Not to mention he’s wrong on the compensation in the Lonzo Ball three way deal since Josh Hart is still on NO:  &gt; There seems to be legitimate traction on a three-team sign-and-trade framework between Chicago, New Orleans and Charlotte that would likely nullify any of the Bulls' fears of losing out on their preferred point guard target. From conversations with multiple league sources, the framework that would be discussed appears to focus on landing Ball in Chicago, Devonte' Graham in New Orleans and Tomas Satoransky, Josh Hart and draft capital to Charlotte."
"The Pelicans tried that and they ended up with Devonte Graham, Tomas Satoransky, and Garrett Temple instead"
So tampering rules require a team to talk to a player under contract with another team. Who did the Pelicans talk to that was under contract?   Pelicans received Tomas Satoransky (under contract) and Garrett Temple from the sign and trade with Bulls. Is the assumption that the Pelicans talked to Temple? Or that the Bulls did to get the sign and trade done?
"that warriors take is hot garbage, they were trying to make a trade for another star but it takes two teams to tango. Not going all in on a Ben Simmons trade was the right idea. Otto Porter and Andre Igoudala were nice signings to help fill out the roster. They had one of the best drafts of any team this year and still have wiseman developing  in the wings. Don't know why they let Eric Paschall go but other they had a good off season   BI has  averaged 23.8/5.5/4.5, on 50/38/86 shooting splits  since coming to New Orleans and was an all star in 2020.He has clearly shown he can be the second best player on a contending team. The pelicans defintley should of gotten more in the bulls trade for lonzo but I like Tomas Satoransky, his height will allow us to play 3 guard lineups  like we did with lonzo. Getting rid of Bledsoe and Adams should be a huge boon for this team offensively and i expect BI and Zion will reap the benefits of the extra space that will be provided.  Jazz were the number one seed and got injured at the wrong time. I liked the Eric Paschall trade and the Rudy gay signing. They also have some interesting pieces they could package to improve there roster should someone they like become available at the deadline."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
we got a first round pick and Thad Young for an unrestricted free agent while y’all got Tomas Satoransky and a second for a rfa a decade younger and also gave up a first for a career sub 40% shooter lol we have the worst team but still had a better off season than y’all. At least y’all got Jonas
imagine if the NBA swings the hammer on the Pelicans for getting Garrett Temple and Tomas Satoransky and nothing else because tampering lost them any leverage
"* ""Hello, Lonzo? This is the Bulls. I assume you're sitting there with the Pelicans so let's cut right to it: what do you guys say to a trade of Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple and a second-round pick so that we can sign Lonzo for $85 million over the next four years?""  * ""Sounds great here, agreement all around.""  * ""Perfect, I'll notify Shams that this is happening.""  * ""Thanks, bye."""
"&gt;  I don’t see how that was hard to understand when I made that point.  I just don't know what specific games you're referring to. Almost every game of that type either  A) Includes NBA players or   B) Is part of a bracket/structure that includes NBA players, making the teams relevant because there is potential for them to directly oppose, say, the USA/France/etc team.  Something like Iran vs Czech Republic is relevant for both of those reasons. Even if you personally don't care for Tomas Satoransky or Hamed Haddadi, some NBA fans do. And even disregarding those guys, the teams would end up facing NBA players at some point in the exact same tournament structure, making them relevant.  Note that this is different from a situation where 2 foreign teams are playing friendlies with no NBA players, in a tournament structure that also has little to no NBA players (like, say, the Lithuanian league preseason). Those games never get posted here."
I actually thought of Tomas satoransky for the Pelicans
His best shot is New Orleans. They want to be good and he can win a starting job over Devante Graham or Tomas Satoransky
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
TOMAS SATORANSKY IN SHAMBLES
Wizards legend Tomas Satoransky
"Think about it like this... if DG is what it takes to get the Pels to S&amp;T Lonzo, then why tf would we take Tomas Satoransky instead of saying ""Hey could we just get Lonzo and cut out the Bulls?"" Obviously this would hinge on Lonzo preferring to play in Charlotte over Chicago which admittedly probably wouldn't work in our favor, but I couldn't disagree more with ""Much better option than Graham to take control of the offense."" Sato is a good player but have you ever watched Devonte play before lmao?"
"I'm not high on Giddey. Guy projects as a Tomas Satoransky type of player. He'll need to put a lot of work in at the next level to get past his weaknesses; namely, shooting, limited athleticism, and defense."
"His defense is very, very suspect, he’s also pretty slow laterally and lacks an explosive first step and shooting is an even bigger issue. He’s being compared to LaMelo because they both played in the NBL but LaMelo’s %’s were down due to him being a volume shooter. You look at Giddey’s NBL numbers and you see 7.5 assists per game and while that looks great, if you watched some of his games, lots of his assists are easy reads or open looks in transition. He’s a great rebounder, as he should be. I really like him in OKC though as long as he gets at least 20 minutes a night. I can see him being a valuable trade asset down the line if everything pans out. It’s so hard to predict what he’ll turn into tbh, I like Rubio as a comparison but Rubio was miles ahead of Giddey defensively in his prime. I’m very interested to watch his development tbh, he could be Tomas Satoransky or he could turn into a triple double machine, that’s the fun of the draft."
"Tomas Satoransky is the ultimate euro player, he is straight trash in the nba"
"Those are still probably bad odds. Tomas Satoransky is Czech's best player, and Behnam Yakhchalidehkordi is Iran's best player. These teams are worse than your average summer league squad."
Tomas Satoransky said no to that
True cuz Nic batum is more scared of Tomas Satoransky than Kevin Durant and Dame
"Along with TPMLE, Warriors can also aggregate a couple of their expiring minimum deals in a trade.   For example someone like Tomas Satoransky is on a partially guaranteed deal ($5M of $10M).  Warriors have to just come up with $4M in salary (Paschall + another player) and  probably some type of a draft asset.  But like you said it's all dependent on how much luxury tax Lacob is willing to shell out.   But there are moves they can make around the edges that allows them to keep their draft picks but still add some veterans.  And they can wait for Klay to come back and then revisit the matter at the trade deadline.  Warriors shouldn't be desperate just yet."
Tomas Satoransky with the step back fade away game winner off the glass incoming
idk exactly but Tomas Satoransky is on there somewhere
Tomas Satoransky  Feels like half of the fanbase thinks he’s gonna be a DNP and I think he’s gonna get way more minutes and be way more productive than most of the fanbase thinks
"In general I don’t think it’s wise to blame one party for these kinds of stories, because every situation is fairy unique - sometimes media catch a whiff that a player might want to play in their home town or whatever and they run with it, sometimes agents drop information for contract negotiation purposes and the media have to report it. Sometimes it really is the player who straight up wants to leave and wants everyone to know about it, a la Simmons.   And with all that being the case, when we criticize “the media” as a monolith, we forget that many of the people who do the actual reporting are incentivized not to get it wrong. There are hacks, pundits, and hack pundits for sure - but do you think Woj makes anything up? Lowe? O’Connor? They’re all sharing information because someone they trust told them it was worth sharing.  And if the incentive doesn’t line up for the media, it absolutely lines up for Satoransky, and for that matter anyone from the Pelicans right now. Even if it’s true Zion wants to leave and Tomas knows it’s true, why would he tell us? He doesn’t want other teams or the media to smell blood more than they already do."
"But they also let Lonzo walk for some reason and got Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple and a second round pick..........  I hate how they didn't trade him earlier if they wanted him to walk."
"Bulls finished 12th in defense improving from 24th after the deadline with vuc, lavine, coby white, Denzel valentine, and tomas satoransky playing heavy minutes.  The defense won't be atrocious, especially when you consider coby white was one of the worst defensive players in the league last year according to raptor."
"So why not match his offer then. Even if you don't want Lonzo, you should be able to trade him for more than just Garrett Temple and Tomas Satoransky"
Tomas Satoransky
"I don't really even buy the money issue since he was an RFA and the Pels could have just matched the deal. Maybe he would have complained a bit but 3 years, $60M is time to get a winning team around there and convince him to stick around (and if he really does get to a point where he refuses to stay, you can always trade him in the last season). I think David Griffin just flat out decided he wasn't going to pay $20M a year for Ball. I have my own theories as to why.  I will say that defense can be super, super tough to depend upon when the team is mediocre since so much of it requires not only effort but the kind of effort that leads to injury risks. Sure, in November and December you get that buy-in, but do you have that in March when the team is only vaguely in the mix for the play-in? And on top of that, if you're in Ball's shoes and you're playing all-out and you're not getting a lot of help and in fact the defense around you is kind of garbage and you're even getting local sportswriters slightly shitting on your hard work because you're not top-tier caliber at literally everything it is possible for a player to do on defense... yeah, I can imagine where it might be hard to depend on that if your team is bad. Still not a good reason to undervalue him and let him go for Tomas fucking Satoransky."
"I think in 2-3 years “Lonzo Ball for Garret Temple, Tomas Satoransky, and a 2nd” will be viewed as a viable addition to this list."
"Griffin didn't want to pay Lonzo 4/85. But yeah, they should have got more than Garrett Temple and Tomas Satoransky back for Lonzo"
"I just realized he’s teammates with Tomas Satoransky lool, I hope he throws a poutine at him"
"That team had Thad Young, Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, and Daniel Theis. They replaced those guys on D with eMar eRozan and not much else."
"I'm not arguing that it's not a bad outcome relative to not losing a pick, but I am arguing that losing a pick, at this stage, with this roster, is not nearly the cost Bulls fans are making it out to be.  It literally just makes the Lonzo S&amp;T a slight overpay to send Garret Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 1st and a 2nd round pick for Lonzo."
"I looked into a few like Michael Porter Jr. and Tomas Satoransky. It looks like MPJ didn't really suffer any kind of a decline but Tomas Satoransky did.  In the future, I'm probably going to see if there are any more NBA players who have seen this type of decline, and embiid is definitely on that list (once more data becomes available)"
"i mean i don’t have strong feelings either way, but like i would root for tomas satoransky way before d rose. same way i’d root for martell webster before mike dunleavy. one of them didn’t fuck over the cavs haha"
"BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM ""Hey David can you sign Tomas Satoransky? Thanks"" \* closes door; \* a muffled boom boom boom slowly echoes into silence."
if he did i’m sure he didn’t take his big ass to the GMs office and ask for tomas satoransky
"To be fair, Tomas Satoransky is a perfectly functional remote"
"I don't necessarily disagree with trading him, but the Pelicans did not get a good deal for Lonzo (Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, 2nd round pick). So they should have just matched the offer and try to trade him for something better in future. A small market team can't afford to just trade your prospect for peanuts."
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
