"I think the major fall off is after Suggs tbh, he is a solid #4 prospect then there's a drop off.   Kuminga isn't that different from Barnes, Keon Johnson or even Jalen Johnson. They're all athletic wings who can't shoot and don't have a clear path to becoming high-level creators, Kuminga is just the youngest of that group."

"I know. Im saying there are certain non-shooters that dont actually drag the entire teams offense down and can actually enhance it with their cutting. Just because defenders cheat in, doesnt mean you as an offensive player physically cannot cut. If you do and the cheating defender completely ignores you, then you nay catch the ball 5 feet away from the rim and score fairly easily. Thus, you can continue to do this and force them to meet you early and bump off the cut (which occupies them as a help man).   Eventually they just stop guarding you in that traditional non-shooter way and just stay home on you so they dont lose track of you. These kinds of players are often bigger or more athletic than many of their opponents so having that amount of space to eat up and gain momentum w/o the ball can put immense pressure on the rim if left unattended. Zion is an extreme example but theres also a kid named Keon Johnson in this draft who I love for the way he cuts without the ball and hangs/crashes around the rim often as a guard"

"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
"If we get a Top 4 pick, I'd be ecstatic with any of the top 5 players in this draft (Cade/Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga).  If we end up more in the 6-10 range, I like Scottie Barnes, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody or even Jalen Johnson.  I like Kai Jones and Usman Garuba as projects, but I'd only take them if we're trading down into the 11-20 range."

I really want Sacramento to get the first and us to get the second so they can draft someone like Keon Johnson. Sorry Sacramento.
"Sorry I just woke up. Keon Johnson is a guy at the very beginning of the college season were saying was flying high under the radar until mocks started catching up. He's the type where eye test &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his superficial stats. His upside is extremely high. Let me explain the love for Keon:  1) He's arguably the best defensive SG prospect in the draft (maybe only Moody is better) and even though he's 6'5, he has a 6'8 wingspan.  2) Although his shooting splits were bad, he has a very mechanically sound jumper and college shooting is notoriously small sample size for a variable that requires a very high sample size for confidence  3) He has a really strong IQ for off-ball movement, his off-ball cutting is elite.  4) He's amazing at drawing fouls and getting to the line - 40% FT/FA rate. Combined with a tight handle, elite athleticism, and a solid FG% at the rim makes him very projectable as a guy who will be able to get to the rim in the NBA.  5) Both him and Jaden Springer are both SGs - so play finishing wasn't really overly productive at Tennessee due to a lack of playmaking  So you have a guy who is a great defender, can handle well, is great at getting to the basket whether that's through FTs or getting around his man, and the only real flaw is he shot terribly in college which ruined his production numbers, but there's nothing real mechanically wrong or shot that needs to be re-worked. Additionally, pretty much all other alternatives are equally as flawed or moreso - Scottie Barnes doesnt have a jumper, Jalen Johnson terribly underperformed in pretty much all aspects, Davion Mitchell and Bouknight are already older and behind on the NBA development curve, etc."
"Can someone explain to me why Keon Johnson is so highly rated? I think The Ringer also had him as their 6th pick. As far as I can tell, he's a combo guard who can't handle, shoot, or pass at anywhere near an NBA level. Did I just watch the wrong games? Are his stats super misleading? Is he that special of an athlete? I just do not see it at all"

"Reasoning:   1. Cunningham is the surefire guy of this draft. You could argue other guys have more upside, but nobody has a higher floor. Cade will be an NBA starter, it's just a question of whether he'd be a third option, second option, or first option on a contender.  2. Green is the type of hyperathletic scoring guard that teams crave. He's the most likely in this draft to become the first option on a contender, in my opinion. He fits well with the Rockets rebuild, forming a dynamic duo with KPJ in the backcourt.  3. Mobley is a fascinating prospect who brings great perimeter skills in a big man's body. His post offense is worrying, and his lack of a shot is too, but his perimeter defense and driving ability as a seven footer make him a unicorn, even if those other skills don't develop.  4. Suggs is the purest PG in the draft, a classic ball handler who projects to do everything right, even if he lacks any one exceptional gift. He's a sizable point guard with no holes in his game. A very safe pick with long term upside. This guy might be Toronto's starting point guard for the next fifteen years.  5. Barnes fits that Patrick Williams mold, and if Williams can go 4th off the Seminoles bench, Barnes can do it as their most important player. He's a big, high motor wing who can lock down guards and has shown potential at the other end. Even if he doesn't develop his shot, he'll be a valuable wing for years to come.  6. Kuminga has the body, he has the athleticism, but his basketball IQ is horrible. He showed flashes of ball handling, shot creation, passing, and mid-range shooting, but his only positive talent right now is getting to the rim from a midrange spot. He's the definition of a boom or bust project pick, but his boom is big enough that he's worth betting on by a rebuilding team, similar to Poku last year.  7. Wagner here is probably going to be controversial. In my defense, John Hollinger at The Athletic and Deanondraft both agree with me. He's a big wing who can guard 1-4 and projects to be very above average at it in the NBA, rebounds well, passes surprisingly well (&gt;2:1 AST:TO), slashes well, and shoots FTs at an elite level for a 19yo, let alone a 6'9 forward. He projects to be a Kelly Oubre type with less hops and finishing ability, but more shooting and passing. He'll be a valuable player from day 1 as a teenager at a premium position, and has all the tools to become an exceedingly solid wing, if probably not ever an all star due to his lack of elite quick twitch muscle. As a final point, if you want to bring up his last game (where he wasn't great), I'll remind you he also outplayed Scottie Barnes in their March Madness matchup.  8. Moody is the most likely guy in this draft to become a plus 3&amp;D wing for the next fifteen years. Lots of Warriors fans want him, but I simply don't see him having the upside of Wagner. He slides into the Orlando roster, providing needed spacing and defense.  9. Johnson has a lot of question marks, but when he has it all together, he puts up crazy numbers. He can do it all. His shot may be questionable but he shows promise. He's the second biggest boom or bust prospect after Kuminga, in my opinion, and Sacramento needs to swing for the fences to get out of their current purgatory.  10. Bouknight has been flying up mock drafts, and I think he's a good pick, but a little overrated at this point. He has some major flaws despite his highlight play athleticism. His ball handling, shooting, and defense all need more work than I think most people recognize.  11. Keon is similar to Bouknight: some very promising signs at the shooting guard position, but a whole bunch of question marks as well. Not too much to say here, just a guy drafted for his potential.  12. Sengun has promise - Hollinger would say I have him way too low - and I get it: he's putting up good numbers in a really good league as a teenager, and such guys rarely fail in the NBA. However, he's a tweener, neither a PF nor a C, and he lacks the shooting that would cover for his deficiencies at either position. He could put it together and be a valuable big man, but he might end up getting run off the floor, too.  13. Giddey is another boom or bust guy, a huge point guard who can pass like crazy, but lacks the shooting or defense requisite for the position. He's young as hell, so it all comes down to a team's deep scouting on him. Can they fix his obvious flaws? If he develops right, he could end up being an amazing player. But that seems to be a long way off. A team like the Pacers, in that 8th seed purgatory, needs to take a gamble to get out, similar to the Nuggets with MPJ.  14. Kispert projects to be the best shooter in this draft, and his defense is actually pretty good. Was in the 25th percentile for lateral movement at the combine, FYI - I definitely had some bias against his defensive skills, picturing him as a lumbering (white) player. But he has the size and strength and shooting skill to be an elite floor spacer, and can drive better than you might imagine. There are questions around his shooting stroke being effective against NBA defense, but in all likelihood he'll be a good-if-not-great 3&amp;D player right out of the gate.   No Davion Mitchell, you ask? Yeah. I'm incredibly low on him. His FT% has declined each season in college. His first two collegiate seasons he shot about 30% from deep, then happened to shoot 45% his last year, without a corresponding increase to 2pt% or FT% - that's the definition of an outlier. Yeah he plays good defense, but his 6'0 height limits him on that end. At best he'll be a smaller Marcus Smart, which is wonderful, but very limited. And I don't think he gets to that level."

"Other people have mentioned this, but I think Kuminga falls. I think his reputation from preps play kept him high in mock drafts, but we are getting no buzz about some team being super into him and I just am not convinced he is actually that good or that high upside.   Assuming Barnes goes top 5, I think the Thunder take Giddey at 6, highest upside player they could find there.  If he falls past them, I actually think the Warriors take him.  And Magic take Moody if the Warriors don't.  Wagner goes to Kings at 9 and is actually a good pick.  Knicks draft Sharife, Thibs loves quick guards and they could use someone that can get to the rim and make plays even without spacing.  Their other pick could be a shooter, like Chris Duarte, a good fit in a Thibs offense, Corey Kispert, or Trey Murphy.  Bucks draft Joel Ayayi.  Might be wrong, but that is the vibe I get based on what I know of the sorts of players Bucks typically value.  All around player from a good NCAA team who can play off the ball well.  I could see them taking Neemias Queta too.  I think Keon Johnson might be a draft slider, while I think Springer actually goes to Pacers at 13.  Tough for non-shooting guards in the league, have to have special characteristics."
"Remember playing full court pick up with upcoming rookie Keon Johnson. I guarded him most of the game till he dunked on me than my teammates got mad sweaty (it was almost the end of the game) so they switched me on to someone else. He then proceeded to wreck my teammates. 🤣  His shot wasn't falling that particular game, but he could go coast to coast with no issue. I think I was A senior in HS then, so he was a freshman I Think?"
"Monkeys paw, raptors take Keon Johnson at 4"
"but he's the highest upside play of any of the guys after 6, imo. it's him vs Bouknight and Keon Johnson, and I take the guy who damn near looks like young Giannis. also seeing him dribble into pullups looks a lot better than most guys would have only like four years into playing basketball.   considering he didn't start playing until he was 15, there's a higher likelihood of skill development long term and I'm very much in on grabbing him at 12 if he's there."

Its a basketball revolution. Not a big man revolution. Skill rises to the top now prioritizing unique in game functional skill over world class athleticism (look at Josh Giddey vs Keon Johnson... One's moving up ones moving down but why)... figuring out how to defend without touching anybody too is another tall task.  Its not about being big... Its about being useless if all you are is big.  Its always been a guy is more effective with size to go with skill.  Now the game is cutting unskilled players out.

"Can't lie, as a Raptors fan I'd take that any day of the week. We are stuck in mediocrity right now, and trading Siakam and Boucher for future assets would significantly cut down on our rebuild time.  We would be able to field a roster of Suggs - Trent - Keon Johnson - OG - Wiseman with more potential trade assets in FVV and Wiggins.  We would have one of the brighter futures in the NBA."
"Marginally improve ? Sure, but to the point where they’re good I doubt it. Being a dominant college player involves skill too, which kuminga clearly lacks. If just being a big bodied athlete means success than Keon Johnson would be a god"
I can see them going with Moses Moody or Keon Johnson
Keon Johnson or trade back for Kispert.
"I meant Keon Johnson, but yea Jalen Johnson definitely has star potential if he works past his mental stuff. Had he not quit on two teams he’d def be going top 5, that’s how talented he is. I think he’s the MPJ/KPJ of this draft"
"&gt;Uhhhhhh this class 1000% lacks shooting lol.  Hyland, Kispert, Moody, Cunningham, Primo, Murphy III, Green, Duarte, Mann. If this class lacks shooting, there's no such thing as a good shooting class.   &gt;give me a list of guys you think are better perimeter defenders  Springer, Garuba, Murphy III, Moody, Henry, McBride, Barnes, Duarte, Edwards, and Keon Johnson projects better."

Keon Johnson
Keon johnson comparison is awful
"Lol watch, Draft day comes, and the Raptors are going to trade down with the magic to take both Keon Johnson and Moses moody"
"Nobody is coping we were fucking debating about Keon Johnson vs Moses Moody before the lottery, we’re going to turn Suggs into an All-Star."
"Tier one is absolutely bonkers but after that these are some creative ideas. I’m not sure how Jalen Green falls to the warriors at 7 though, you’d probably have to be anticipating more of a Keon Johnson around there"
it's about to be Keon Johnson
Keon Johnson bout to be when he gets drafted
Keon Johnson
"look, im actually not opposed to this for a few reasons  first of all, look at kentucky basketball. they put 7 guys in the lottery every year but coach Calipari has only won once, and that was 2012 and that was AD.  so, if the Lakers want 7 rookies, i dunno, could be fun and doesnt guarantee anything. plus, the Lakers might have a guy like LeBron around to veto certain signings, a la trading Wiggins for the more proven abilities of KLove.  team ups could be fun and good for the league. look at KAT and DLo. put KAT and DLo on the Suns instead of CP3 and Ayton, are they in the wcf? probably not. but theyre getting to hoop with their friends right? a bad team could be like, we arent attached to any of our guys, we will sign 5 rookies who want to team up. i mean, we all love the Fab5 from Michigan right? in basketball terms i mean, that was fun.  some players might be able to dictate the terms of their signing, like Cade this year could probably tell the Knicks, who have cap space (i think) to make him an offer, but does Keon Johnson have that kind of power? i doubt it.   so, that wouldnt be awful. it might be an ugly way to start a career, like a prenup ruining a honeymoon"
"I'm not sure whether Trent Jr. a restricted FA or not, but resigning him along with this trade gives you guys a playoff level squad immediately:  PG: FVV – Suggs – Flynn  SG: Trent – 7th pick – x  SF: OG – Bembry – Watanabe  PF: Wiggins – x – Gillespie  C: Wiseman – Boucher – x  The 7th pick being one of Bouknight, Moody and Keon Johnson gives you a great young core that just needs to be supplemented at the spots marked x."
I would take it in a heartbeat. We’re not going anywhere with Pascal as our number one option.  Wiseman is a young center who had to miss a year of competitive basketball in college. I don’t think he looked awful considering that as well as centers taking awhile to develop. Throw in a lottery ticket at 7 like Keon Johnson and I would gladly eat that Wiggins contract
I'd shoot for Mitchell or Keon Johnson
"Yeah Suggs, Green and Mobley would all go number 1 if they were in separate draft classes and then 7 is a guy like Barnes, Giddey or Keon Johnson who all have great potential too. I can understand why the Pistons might not trade it for 4 and 7 but it's not that crazy of an idea"
raps like keon johnson
"If we package 19/21 and trade up - Bouknight is my personal fav. But I wouldn’t mind Moody, Ziaire, Keon, Davion, Giddey   If we stay at 19/21 I’m down with any two of: Sharife, Duarte, Springer, Jalen Johnson"
Didn’t Keon Johnson have like a 48 inch vert?
"Agreed, but you could argue Keon Johnson has the upside of Dwyane Wade as a 6'4.75 SG who is one of the best defensive guards in the draft and literally has the greatest vert in NBA draft history  much lower floor tho than those you mentioned"
Keon Johnson is terrible imo
I say go against the grain and take Keon Johnson
"See I understand where you’re coming from, but I guess we just have different opinions on player development. To me, if you’ve been able to turn draft day scraps into the supporting cast of a championship team, I’d say you’re better gambling on multiple players with great upside.   With Suggs, it feels weird that they’re drafting Suggs to essentially take the keys of their franchise to a rookie. And you gotta remember that no matter how sure a thing they are, there’s still no guarantee they’re actually better in the  long or even short term. Get Kuminga and a Davion Mitchell or maybe a Scottie Barnes or a Keon Johnson."
"Kings and Thunder fans what do y'all think about this trade?   Thunder: 6th pick   Kings: 9th and Bagley   Idk how much you Thunder fans value the 6th pick but it could get you Bagley and have him at center and might be improved with a change of scenery. Then puts you in position to draft a Keon Johnson(Saw your thread was interested), a Davion Mitchell, Kispert, Moody, Giddey, etc.   For the Kings fans I feel like the Bagley breakup is obv a long time coming and i'm not sure how high his trade value is. This puts you in position to get Scottie Barnes. A very versatile player."
"No, I’m saying that The Raptors have done well developing talent so it makes sense for them to bank on developing projects. So they’d be getting two picks but banking on upside. And a lot of the best players weren’t picked at the top of the draft. In fact on the championship raps team, I believe none of those guys were taken above like number 11 or something. Getting a Kuminga and maybe a Davion Mitchell or that guy Keon Johnson who just broke the record for his vertical at the combine.    the reality of the draft is that rookies don’t always come in and are ready to take over teams or live up to their hype on draft day. There’s always an apparent sure thing that we’re wrong about. It’s just the facts. Whereas Masai has found plenty of success just not missing on projects."
Keon Johnson is significantly better defensively as a prospect and significantly more athletic and is great at getting to the line and is like a few inches shorter and like 20 lbs lighter and is not a forward  I have no idea where you got Oubre from
Keon Johnson: https://youtu.be/BiqpbXMKwfs
"I should say I could also see Toronto trying to move up to Two for Mobley if they could, or staying and taking the best available of course, but getting a project like Kuminga and a Davion Mitchell? Maybe even a Keon johnson(who o like because of his name) or that 6’9 euro guy?!"
THE REAL TRUTH BEHIND KEON JOHNSON (TRAGIC CONSPIRACY THEORY) (IS THE NBA RIGGED?)
"“The Kings traded the 9th pick, Fox, and Haliburton to move up to the #1 pick. They must really like Cade.”  “With the 1st pick in 2021 draft, the Kings select… Keon Johnson from Winthrop University.”"
The Kings aren't passing up on Franz Wagner in favor of Keon Johnson.
Keon Johnson?
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
With the First pick in the 2021 NBA draft the Detriot Pistons select.....Keon Johnson!
Why is Davion Mitchell and Keon Johnson projected so high. I don’t understand. I’d rather draft moody or bouknight
Keon Johnson will be the steal of this draft
Keon Johnson will be the goat because he has a very similar first name to me 😎

He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
"Man, Keon Johnson better become a heck of a player because I wanted Garuba."
"This was such a strange draft honestly, partially because it was ridiculously deep seeming, and also because a lot of NBA teams didn't get to watch these guys play in person bc of the pandemic restrictions. You can bring them in for a workout sure, but only so many guys, and playing in a meaningful 5v5 game is totally different to 1v0 or even group workouts.  In a normal year someone with Boston's college season would still probably go 2nd round but like in the 30s, not 53. Guys who dropped in this draft *really* dropped, because the average player was so much better than usual, and so less incentive to take a chance. Sengun, Cooper, Jalen Johnson, Keon and Boston are all excellent examples of this."
Keon johnson
"He's a junior, he flamed out at Kansas, and he was pretty much 3 and D in college. Didn't get to the rim a lot, didn't get a lot of FTs, etc. So he has less upside than someone like Keon Johnson or Jaden Springer, but a way higher floor too."
But u do with raw af Keon Johnson and kai Jones  Wtf  Also stop sengun is not going to be that good. Doesn't really push us forward in tryna contender. Someone like chat Paolo and Duran will and could
"Of the Clippers rookies I expected the least from Brandon Boston right away, but hes been the best rookie from their class so far. He’s shown excellent flashes. Good three point shooter, good passer and very active on defense. He’s impressed me the most of their crop.   Keon Johnson looks very raw but his athleticism is notable. His three point shot needs work, but I’m glad he’s not gunshy (Jerome Robinson was always scared to shoot). His defense has been good. I believe he would benefit the most from playing with the regular roster.   Jason Preston he has excellent court vision and pace. His passes have been very good and on the off chance they are bad it’s mostly timing, instead of not seeing the potential pass. His defense has been mediocre and the rest of his offensive package has been lacking, but he can learn from Rondo and Ty Lue hopefully.   As far as other teams go I liked what I saw from Jordan Nwora. He looks like a legit nba player."
Caris LeVert. Dejounte Murray. Alperen Sengun. Keon Johnson. Kevin Porter Jr.
Kuminga is raw  Keon Johnson is raw and not even as advanced as ant is
Kuminga is 6’8 with athletic potential through the roof and he went 7th. Ant Edwards is the same height as Keon Johnson who has a 48 inch vert and he went 21st.
Boards had Keon Johnson at 6 a few weeks ago. They were all over the place
"Fair enough, I don’t think his athleticism is bad. He’s certainly no keon Johnson or Jalen green but it’s more than passable, mainly due to his size, nba ready frame and strength. Hoping he does well but only time will tell"
"Spurs coulda had Keldon Johnson and Keon Johnson. But they don't, so it's whatevs"
"They'd have their 2028 1st available. Could potentially try something where they trade swap rights (again) in years 2023, 2025 wherein the Sixers would get the better of their own pick or whichever pick the Clippers would get in those years. Then they've got Boston, Keon Johnson, and Terrance Mann as well. Morris and Kennard get you most if not all the way there salary wise."
"We've got Preston, Boston and Keon Johnson on our squad as well.  They along with Coffey,Scrubb and Oturu are important for us."
"BJ Boston, Keon Johnson, Jason Preston and the great Jordan Ford"
Would have said Keon Johnson until I watched a video today of BJ Boston making 26 threes in a minute.  His shot looks so good.  Feels like he has a very high ceiling but also a very low floor.
He definitely can be the next Kawhi. However this year’s draft is very deep. Many raw talents. For example Keon Johnson could be the next Dwyane Wade. However they all need time and opportunities and space to make mistakes to get there.
"It could be a good addition the more I think about it.   Basketball wise, with shooting around him he could attack the basket and look for kick outs(seemed like the most successful way the Clips played last season) and can push the fast break(with T. Mann, and hopefully with Keon Johnson) or at the very least hit the corner 3. And reuniting him with Cousins could be a good thing for both players(if he's still on the roster) And leaving a big chunk of money on the table would mean he's betting on himself so hopefully he's feeling like he's over his injuries and can contribute in a meaningful way(but we saw Love try that with the Olympic team so it doesn't always work out) but if it does then they could trade some of the extra guards before the trade deadline.  But there seems to be some hurdles before any of that can happen."
"Yes but it would involve a bunch of contracts that arent pretty good probably, clippers don't have too many assets to give, I guess maybe some of the players they picked this draft? Like Keon Johnson."
"&gt; I don't think the Clippers have a realistic shot at DeRozan.  Terence Mann, Marcus Morris Sr., Keon Johnson and BJ Boston. Clips can dump a lot of contracts too, to go below the apron.  &gt; Both the Lakers and Clippers are gonna be way over the apron Spurs can absorb a lot of contracts in a trade. It will come down to what the teams will be offering, so Spurs would agree and take those contracts."
Keon johnson is on the Clippers. We drafted Quentin Grimes with our first round pick.
"I don't think they need ""Devin Booker"" level hits, they need to find dudes like Cam Johnson to compliment Leonard and George. They had trouble with speedy guards and they got Keon Johnson. If he can defend for a good 15 minutes that's all they need."
"The hard cap is $143 million, so let's say the Clippers trade for DeRozan, here's what that would look like (I'm using Morris and Beverley for DeRozan in this example):  * Paul George - $39 million  * Kawhi - $39 million  * DeRozan - $24 million (the minimum amount he could be signed for to make this trade work)  * Kennard - $13 million  * Ibaka - $10 million  * Rondo - $8 million  * Zubac - $7.5 million  * Keon Johnson - $2.5 million  * Mann - $2 million  * Oturu - $2 million  * **Total - $147 million**  So even if they trade Morris and Beverley for DeRozan and don't re-sign Batum or Reggie Jackson, they'd still be over the hard cap. They'd probably have to straight up salary dump Rondo somewhere also. So do the Clippers really want to exchange 5 rotation players for DeRozan? I doubt it."
"They've got a crowded backcourt still, even with Payton, Rose, etc. leaving. Barrett, Keon Johnson, and Quickley are all going to be on the squad. I wouldn't hate Dragic and Barrett starting though."
"&gt;You just named off Morris, Beverley, Kennard, Ibaka and Rondo…..you really think one of those players can’t be traded to clear cap room to sign someone like Demar?  How many rotation players are the Clippers willing to lose just to get DeRozan though? If they traded for him then the hard cap would prevent them from bringing back Batum and Reggie Jackson, in addition to the probably two players they'd have to trade for DeRozan, and they might have to salary dump another player elsewhere on top of that.   The hard cap is $143 million, so let's say the Clippers trade for DeRozan, here's what that would look like (I'm using Morris and Beverley for DeRozan in this example):  * Paul George - $39 million  * Kawhi - $39 million  * DeRozan - $24 million  * Kennard - $13 million  * Ibaka - $10 million  * Rondo - $8 million  * Zubac - $7.5 million  * Keon Johnson - $2.5 million  * Mann - $2 million  * Oturu - $2 million  * **Total - $147 million**  So even if they trade Morris and Beverley for DeRozan and don't re-sign Batum or Reggie Jackson, they'd still be over the hard cap. They'd probably have to straight up salary dump Rondo somewhere also. So do the Clippers really want to exchange 5 rotation players for DeRozan? I doubt it."
Look up Leonel Marshall. Has a higher vertical than anyone to ever play in the NBA. Including Keon Johnson
"I'm puzzled Turner says that DeRozan is putting the brakes on going to the Lakers cause he doesn't want to take that big of a pay cut, but then in the same article says DeRozan is thinking about going to the Clippers when they can't offer him any more money than the Lakers can.   And look, I know people are gonna be like ""the Clippers can just sign and trade for him"" but no, they really can't. So before you go thinking the Clippers are any better equipped to stay under the hard cap than the Lakers are, [you should really have a look at how huge the Clippers payroll is going to be this year.](https://i.imgur.com/xukgBa5.png) Allow me to do the math on that: that's $134 million just for those 8 players. The hard cap is going to be $143 million.   Now I want you to also consider that this $134 million total doesn't include a few things. For one, it sure seems likely that Kawhi will not opt in for that final year, which means he'll probably opt out and sign a 1+1 for an extra $3 million (exactly the same amount as Paul George this year). This total also does not include the combined $6 million for Terrance Mann, Daniel Oturu, and their new 1st round pick, Keon Johnson. And finally it does not include the salaries of either Nic Batum or Reggie Jackson.   The Clippers total salary this year figures to probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of $160+ million, which is very far above the $143 million hard cap. So no, I don't think DeRozan is likely to join the Clippers, for the same reason he's unlikely to join the Lakers: $5.9 million is probably too little for him."
"Terance mann, zubac, keon johnson, kennard, bj boston and jason preston are young"
"Every players grows 1-2 inches in shoes, so how tall he is in shoes is irrelevant. No one calls Draymond 6’7.  Keon Johnson shot 27% from 3 last season. You lost all credibility by calling him a great shooter"
"They probably like the fit of the other guys instead of a high upside high potential guy like Keon johnson, the clippers really got a steal with their pick"
"Thanks also if you want to include them here are the first round draft pick trades  * Knicks recieve: Hornets future first round, Hornets recieve: Pick 19 (Kai Jones) * Knicks recieve: Pick 25 and future 2nd rounder, Clippers recieve pick 21 (Keon Johnson) * Thunder recieve: 2 future picks, Rockets recieve: Pick 16 (Alperen Sengun)"
&gt;projected lottery pick(Keon johnson)  That's a weird way to say the 21st pick
"They have a projected lottery pick(Keon johnson) 2 rookies, kennard, bev, rondo, zubac and Terrance mann and a bunch of 2nd round picks"
"1. Our FO almost never leaks  2. We don't really have many options--we're over the cap and don't have any picks left to trade  BTW we also drafted Keon Johnson (inexperienced G/F with a shaky jumper but insane athleticism) and B.J. Boston (top prospect out of HS who fell hard due to an awful year at college, but still has potential)."
Kawhi pg and keon Johnson 😤😤😤
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don’t bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"

Usman Garuba  Keon Johnson
so preston boston and keon johnson not a bad draft
"So what Keon Johnson is to defense, he is to playmaking?"
"As an Illinois fan I’m so fucking pissed he fell this far. Who the fuck is Aldama? But...this is legit the best case scenario in the 2nd. Family is so important to him and he’ll be super comfortable, probably fucking pissed and ready to prove everybody wrong and just play ball. Seriously, Keon Johnson can’t even shoot a basketball and Ayo goes at 38. Fuck"
Only a second to move up 4 spots. Pre nice.   Keon Johnson o/u for this draft was 8.5 on the betting markets initially.
People on this sub keep saying stuff like this but anyone who watched the Vols knows Keon Johnson was the primary ball handler down the floor
"He's a great prospect which I wanted after Cam Thomas, very Brogdon like with how he plays. Always thought he was better than Keon Johnson."
"Keon ""We On"" Johnson"
prefer this pick over Keon Johnson
"Keon Johnson got traded twice tonight alone, from the Knicks to the Pistons to the Clippers, in the span of like 15 minutes."
Not thrilled but if it’s this or taking Keon Johnson I’ll take it
Keon Johnson is a L and a D away from being Keldon Johnson so that’s an appropriate draft comp
Keon Johnson is a terrible shooter ..
If Keon Johnson isn't an elite defender by the end of his rookie contract I'd be surprised
Keon Johnson looks pissed that it took this long
Finally Keon Johnson got picked. He’s a freak athlete
Butler or Keon Johnson with this pick I guess.
"I wanted Keon Johnson earlier, so I really hope the Knicks take him here."
Damn wanted him for the Knicks.  Keon Johnson then..?
I guess Keon Johnson killed someone
"Kai Jones, Keon Johnson, J.T. Thor, Jaden Springer, Sharieff Cooper, Jared Butler, etc… are all still on the board. We have options"
Does no one want Keon Johnson?!
Keon Johnson punching the air rn
"Garuba, Keon Johnson, J Johnson all still on the clock?"
Are there pics of Keon Johnson doing meth floating around that I'm not aware of??
Keon Johnson?  Didn't the Spurs already take him?
Keon Johnson to the spurs just feels right.
Keon Johnson
Keon Johnson
Keon Johnson the steal of this draft if he isn’t top 10
"Even though he’s projected to be a lottery pick, people be sleeping on Keon Johnson. Some think he’s a bust but he is similar to other highly regarded players such as Barnes and Kuminga."
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
1. Jalen Green   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Suggs   4. Usman Garuba   5. Evan Mobley   6. James Bouknight   7. Alperen Sengun   8. Keon Johnson   9. Jared Butler   10. Scottie Barnes    Obviously some 2nd rounder is going to crash the party but I think all 10 of those guys are in great places to be high floor high ceiling.
1. Jalen Green 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Cade Cunningham 4. Alperen Sengun  5. Sharife Cooper 6. James Bouknight 7. Corey Kispert 8. Evan Mobley 9. Keon Johnson 10. Cameron Thomas  Not my top 10 big board. Just going based off how previous drafts have shaken up.

I think Kai Jones is going to fall wayyyyy lower than people think. Also Keon Johnson isn’t going until the mid 20s.
"But, like, he still could though. As could the next high-upside prospect you swing for.   Not that he'd have to though - even if they don't, pulling top 50-75 players out this range still happens and is very valuable - Where'd you draft Parker ffs? Ginobli? Brogdon, OG, Siakam, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, etc. were all pulled from this range recently, and that's just who we know is really good.   The point is, you gotta be taking those chances if you ever want to get a star, and the more chances you take, the more likely you find one. Esp when you've got a good track record of developing late picks and can afford the possibility of busting, continuously taking chances on these guys is good strategy. Ziarre, Keon Johnson et al could totally be one of those guys, even if it's not that likely.  Unless you think the Knicks don't have anything better to do these days than burn their stash on Derozan"
Usually guys that can come in right away and be a good role player like davion for example is a good shooter and defender and while he probably won't get much better and his potential isn't as high as someone like keon johnson hes the better pick for contenders bc he can come in and help right away unlike keon johnson
"Not saying I'd do it, but I would assume if we did a Siakam for Turner trade this we'd trade down a pick or two a 4 and just resign Boucher to be our 4. So something like this:  1. Siakam for Turner + 13 + Lamb + Pacers lotto protected 1st rounder  2. \#4 for #6 + #16 - We draft Kuminga or Barnes  Turner/Birch  Boucher/Kuminga  Anunoby/#16  Trent/#13  VanVleet/Flynn  and the idea would be that Barnes or Kuminga would excel as a 4 with the ability to break down guys off the dribble and we'd add a couple more wings at 13 and 16, say Keon Johnson and Garuba. We miss the playoffs next year but that's lots of young talent to develop."
"Kuminga is a raw prospect and the GSW dont wanna waste Curry, Dray, and Klay's prime  by getting players that are gonna take a long time to develop. If they really want players that would help them, they should get James Bouknight, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody, Davion Mitchell, Corey Kispert."
Bro you’re high off your kites if you think the Spurs are gonna draft Keon Johnson.
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6.

Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
Keon Johnson would be a good fit imo
"think this works out for both teams, hopefully Moody is still around at 10 for Memphis. Or maybe they're not confident Keon Johnson will be available at 17?"
"I think I'd rather bet on Cam's upside at that point unless maybe if some player I/the team was high on dropped to 18.   Like, maybe if Kai Jones or Keon Johnson dropped to 18, but otherwise, I'd rather roll the dice on keeping Cam.  Late lotto is the range that I'd hope for/could see happening."
"Right on, I’m personally a bigger believer in Moses Moody, Franz Wagner, and Keon Johnson than Bouknight even if it’s not Barnes or Kuminga at 6"
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"Wisemen, (and hypothetically) Bouknight + Keon Johnson would not be a great core tbh. If the team already has a good young core then that would be a great addition, but that’s not something you build around."
sounds like kuminga or keon johnson

I mean that's why there intriguing  to look at via drafting. There a speciman  like kai Jones and Keon Johnson. If they meet what we  see of them. There amazing. If they don't well oof
Keon Johnson is the next Giannis type draft steal
"Cade Cunningham will be a role player.  Evan Mobley will be the best player in the draft, with Jalen Green a close second.  Kuminga, Wagner, and Keon Johnson will bust hard."
"It’s situational. Kuminga, Giddey and maybe even Keon Johnson (a bit high) could all be available at 7, but the Warriors can’t afford to take on a project.    They need somebody who can contribute now. If they can’t get somebody like Bouknight there, it’s not a great draft slot for Golden State."
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
"Keon Johnson and Kai Jones' stock seems to be falling off a cliff. They're both wildly higher upside picks than most of the guys in the range I've been seeing them mocked at recently, so I don't really get it.   Like, I'm one of the biggest Kai Jones pessimists, but there's no way a guy with his tools should drop to 24."
"Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Looney  Poole, Keon Johnson, Kispert, JTA, Wiseman"
Google says 1. Fox 2. Keon Johnson 3. Donovan 4. Westbrook 5. Zhaire Smith.   Ja #8 and Simmons #9
"You’d go for the all-dunk crew. Bridges, Oubre, Simmons and Kai. Should’ve drafted Keon Johnson over Bouknight."
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
&gt; they have no picks for the foreseeable future  Lawrence drafted at least 2 lottery level talents in Keon Johnson and Brandon Boston. The roster went from super old to relatively young this year. The team is definitely taking the opportunity to develop young guys in this gap year where Kawhi is injured
"&gt; And it's not like Scottie is some scrub, dude has some legit point guard skills and is a killer on D.     No he's definitely not a scrub or anything, I just always take issue with the argument that you can't teach size/athleticism as if you can easily teach high end skill development.       It's the same argument people make every year to draft some physically talented but underskilled players (Keon Johnson in this class for instance) saying ""but look how Giannis and Kawhi developed""."
Is Keon Johnson a Michael Jordan level athlete only? What exactly does this post do?
"Doubt it will happen given contract matching - but a combination of Bledsoe, Kennard, Winslow and Keon Johnson for John Wall and Danuel House works in the trade machine. I don't know if the trade machine is working right though because that deal also is able to go through even though the Clippers take on an additional 10M in salary.."
"I like what Ralph Lawler said: we are a tier 2 PG away from winning the championship. We don't need to swing for Lillard/Curry type of tier 1 PG. We can go for a tier 2 type of PG. Wall can potentially be that if his health hasn't derailed him. Kawhi and PG make us championship contenders. But having a tier 2 PG that can playmake, be a leader, defend, and have a jumpshot/shoot the 3 when plays break down is what we have been looking for.  As for trading for a star PG, the worst part is that Ralph said we have to be ready to give up Terance Mann. And honestly, he's right. Mann's stock is at an all time high. He's talented and a hard worker but realistically he won't be a star player. We have other rookies that Houston might like in BJ Boston and Keon Johnson. Both are high upside players but also low floors."
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
"No one is salty the Lakers got him. His shooting still sucks and he has a chance to get buried on the bench because he’s unplayable with Russ. He’s practically Cedi Osman 2.0. He’s a quality role player at best and if you see potential superstar or the future of the Lakers you are severely overrating him. Now since he was taken mid second and some second round picks don’t even play I can see him climbing to late first. But heck, you’re even taking Keon Johnson and Shariffe Cooper over him. Also if the Lakers had the chance at 22 to take THT or Duarte they would’ve taken Duarte. Now the Rockets? They probably would go THT."
"He wasn't that highly touted. This sub and guys like KOC are so willing to just ignore his serious limitations. He's undersized, sucks at defense at the position where defense is most important, and he's an archetype that has been dying for 10 years.   His development path is so full of ""ifs"". If he can develop a 3 ball, if he can become a good defender, etc.   Guys like Duarte, Moody, Bouknight are known quantities with clear strengths that work in the modern NBA. And those guys have real upside too. Sengun is a much greater risk even if he has a slightly higher ceiling (which I would dispute anyways).  Sengun went pretty much where he should have Al things considered. Honestly I'd argue that Murphy, Keon Johnson, and Garuba could have gone higher than him. But late lottery is a very reasonable spot."
If they were willing to add in BJ Boston or Keon Johnson then it’s a lot more tempting.
"Trying to think of teams that could really use Rubio, and what they could potentially trade for him and his $17.8m contract; remembering the Cavs largely need wing depth:   **Boston Celtics:** Would have to be some combination of Richardson and Nesmith/Langford.   **Los Angeles Clippers:** Luke Kennard and maybe Keon Johnson?   **New Orleans Pelicans:** Josh Hart and maybe Trey Murphy?   Hard to find much of a market for him where the other team can give up much."
&gt;Vertical  &gt;Cassius Stanley  I'm taking Keon Johnson   &gt;3PT  &gt;Klay  I'm definitely taking Steph over Klay
"Lmao wtf is this, for us Morris, Drummond, and Mclemore are key losses but for the clippers Keon Johnson, Bledsoe, and Winslow are key arrivals?"
"Keon Johnson there at #7, too.   Did the Clippers scouts pick because of this?   /s but also not /s"
"Offense still looks great even without Kawhi, but the defense has been a big problem (the Blazers game was more them shooting themselves in the foot than our defense being good). Our bench unit has been crushing it though, and I think that's sustainable.  Bledsoe has surprised me for the better; his decision-making is often frustrating and he can't shoot, but the driving, passing, defense, and particularly effort have all been there. Marcus and Reggie are the ones playing badly, but that's not really surprising since Marcus is injured and Reggie's just missing shots.  The Bledsoe trade looks like a success so far like I said. Winslow's been ok; the offense isn't there but he can defend 1-5 pretty well. Hartenstein is an intriguing player and could be an NBA starter if he gets his fouling under control.  One of our rookies is injured, the other is sick, and the last one is a 51st pick who's only played once in garbage time, so way too early to say for any of them. Taking summer league and preseason into account, Brandon Boston seems the most ready to play real minutes since he can at least put the ball in the hoop. Keon Johnson is going to be a multi-year project, and Jason Preston has skills but I'm seriously concerned about his (relative) lack of athleticism.  This isn't really what you're asking, but Marcus is our biggest swing piece not named Kawhi. If he can't get his knees right, that'll make it a lot more difficult for us to go small."
You mean the Keon Johnson trade
"1st pick was Keon Johnson taken in this draft, the other pick should convey next year for the 2023 draft."
"Clippers have no Kawhi, no Batum, no Ibaka, that's three starters. No Keon Johnson either. Hopefully we can take advantage."
All three rookies are suppose to bring something different and fill needs down the line. Jason Preston=Ceiling is a floor general decent size guard that loves the pick and roll. Injured his foot and may miss half the season but Lue mentioned he’s picking up schemes and asking lots of questions   Keon Johnson= the super athlete and energetic defender. Guy is very raw on offense and his overall game will need work but only 19 and should show signs of being a lockdown defender in a few years.  Brandon Boston Jr= the scorer! There is no shot he’s afraid to take and he will take it while having a nice handle with great range.  Extreme confidence
Keon Johnson
"Man imagine Keldon and Keon Johnson on the same team, Spurs of course"
"Jimmy Graham measured in at 6'6"" 260 with a 38.5 inch vertical jump in the 2010 nfl combine .  Aside from Keon Johnson this year (41 inches), this would be the highest vert jump measured at the nba combine since Nick Young in 2007 (39.5 inches) .  And this is taking into account that 260 lbs is a top 3 heaviest prospect in each nba draft class .  But sure ""pedestrian athletes'"
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9’0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn’t as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6’1.25 H, 8’1 SR), Keon Johnson (6’3.5 height, 8’1 SR), Jericho Simms (6’9 H, 8’10 SR), Jalen Harris (6’2.75 H - 8’1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6’10 H, 9’1 SR), Tyler Bey(6’6 H, 8’9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."
"Man... congrats, wanted either him or Garuba for the Clippers... hopefully Keon Johnson pans out.  Glad that Bones went to one of my favourite teams/ the most fun team in the league currently, probably."
It’s gonna be Keon Johnson guys. Aka Keon genesis Evangelion
"I won't lie, I wish we picked Bones Hyland over Keon Johnson. As an LAC fan, I hope I regret writing this comment and get called out as an idiot in a few years time."
keon johnson was out sick
"Brandon Boston, the 51st pick getting legitimate minutes over Keon Johnson is wild"
"That's true. And if that's the case, I'm super excited about Keon Johnson and Jason Preston."
I love how they say Keon Johnson
"Sleeper pick: Keon Johnson, he’s one of the most athletic guys in the league and in the g league he’s improved so fast in a few months."
"Keon Johnson is currently averaging 19-4-4 on a 67.7 TS% with 1.7 steals and 1 block in three games. Obviously, the sample size is pretty small due to injury but he has looked great in the minutes he played so far."
Depends on how you define athleticism.  I see a lot of votes for tall guys but it’s probably someone like Keon Johnson.
"If we’re talking deep fucking value, Keon Johnson. He was a huge boom/bust guy in this past draft, incredible athlete with high BBIQ but had no handle or jumpshot… however in a very short time he’s grown a LOT, his handle and shot were clearly better in G League than they were in Summer league. If that rapid growth continues he could explode into one of the best wings in the league."
"He was really bad at Kentucky in a lot of ways, but no-one thought he drop *that* far. This was a really weird draft in that respect, when guys dropped they *really* dropped.  Jared Butler, Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper, BJ Boston, Keon Johnson, Cam Thomas all absolutely dropped and managed to find themselves of high caliber playoff teams which is pretty wild considering their talent level. If they went lottery/top 10 in another (weaker) draft it wouldn't have surprised me."
"No, it's probably Ja, but just wait til you see Keon Johnson"
"The thing is there are a lot of great players from the 2021 who haven't even started to    really play. Moody, Kuminga, Bouknight, Keon Johnson, Garuba to name a few. Jason Preston is injured too. And Dosunmu has crazy competition for minutes but he's getting better every game. As for next year I think almost everyone has already heard of Chet, Banchero or Duren, but there are going to be many players who are going to get more recognition as the season goes on like Patrick Baldwin Jr (my personal favorite), Kennedy Chandler, Caleb Love and international prospects like Yannick Nzosa (if you think Mobley's defense is advanced for his age wait until you see this guy) or Nikola Jovic."
"I personally had Barnes in the next tier down with Moody, Jalen Johnson, Springer, Keon, Sengun, and Wagner.  I thought he was clearly one of the best and most versatile defenders in the draft and had clear elite athleticism, but his lack of a J in college and not having the latitude to be a point forward in the NBA opened up a ton of massive question marks for me.  His multidimensionality in the NBA has been the most surprising thing for me, and I did not think he'd be as good of a scorer as he has been.  Though I'm always curious on how much the summer development played in that considering the Raps have one of the best development teams in the NBA. Like, if they drafted Suggs instead would we be talking this way about Suggs while Barnes struggles on the Magic because playing under the Raps org seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy?"
"Keon Johnson, Ibaka, and a late 1st is dogshit value for Wood. Only trade that really makes sense is if Warriors send Wiseman, Moody, and Kuminga for him. Or at least two of those 3 and maybe a pick."
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
