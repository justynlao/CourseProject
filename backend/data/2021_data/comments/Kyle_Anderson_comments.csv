"Rooting for Malcolm to reach it again. He‚Äôs gonna end up being one of the most underrated players of all time.  Already hit 50-40-90 once. Most likely All Star this year. Quite honestly think he‚Äôll lead (co lead w/ Sabonis) the pacers to a conference finals appearance at least. Dude won ROTY, won defensive player of the year in college. He‚Äôs done practically everything. And off the court man is a genius. Malcolm is a pure good guy. Has that organization for building wells in parts of Africa. I love that organization man, so many Africans have to walk so far just to get access to water which Americans take for granted. Build wells for them just beautiful. Joe Harris Justin Anderson Kyle Guy Garrett Temple. Tolliver. They are all involved with it, just a beautiful organization"

Memphis is an easy team to root for.  Also they're extremely loaded in backcourt depth it's kind of bonkers.  PG: Ja / Tyus Jones  SG: Dillon Brooks / DeAnthony Melton / Grayson Allen  SF: Kyle Anderson / Desmond Bane / John Konchar  They basically have so many shooting guards that they're slotting the bigger ones in the wing slot. And remember they still have Justise Winslow.  I could see them consolidating their depth for another good wing in the future.
"I have Kyle Anderson, JJJ, Valanciunas, Clarke, Jones, and Dillon Brooks on my fantasy team."
"Yeah, other than some of the top picks it's a very decent draft.  Smart, Randle, Lavine, Nurkic, Capela.   Some other serviceable guys like Payton, Saric, Gary Harris, Kyle Anderson, Bogdan^2, etc."
More dirty shit from Kyle ‚ÄúAnderson varejao‚Äù Lowry
Kyle Anderson
Good Guy Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson felt like a Boris Diaw regen and i thought he was gonna be a spurs legend. I remember ROOTING for the Spurs to take him and when they did I damn near wanted to buy his jersey
Kyle Anderson üò§
I was comparing him to Kyle Anderson lol
"There were only five picks between 2012 and 2019, one of which was Looney (Looney, McCaw, Jones, Bell, Evans). You going to blame the Spurs for taking Livio Jean-Charles, Deshaun Thomas, Cory Jefferson, Jordan McRae, Kyle Anderson, Cady Lalanne, and Nikola Milutinov between 2013 to 2015? No, because criticizing teams for only occasionally getting quality NBA players out of late firsts and seconds is stupid."
Dude no shit looks like Kyle Anderson out there  Ooooo and a slam down the lane with 2 hands? I like this kid
"They‚Äôre playing well now, Pop always maximizes value out of guys. Boban, Bertans, Mills, Diaw, Kyle Anderson. He always gets them to play really well in their roles and then they get higher offers from other teams. He seems to be doing it again with Murray, White, Keldon and Walker"
Slow never hindered Kyle Anderson lmao
"Kyle Anderson, Thad Young, Larry Nance, someone like that, none of these other guys people pick like Zach LaVine are actually underappreciated."
its a tough transition when a player who relies so much on athleticism gets into the league and realizes that literally everyone in the league is an insane athlete outside of kyle anderson.
"No and that's the problem.  As of Jan 10th:  ""Winslow (hip) has been doing more on-court work but has no timetable for a return, Evan Barnes of The Memphis Commercial Appeal reports.  Winslow has yet to play this season due to a hip injury he suffered in July and his return does not appear imminent. Coach Taylor Jenkins said Winslow is participating in practice ""here and there,"" but that he doesn't have a defined timetable to return. His eventual return could cut into the role of Kyle Anderson.""  Nothing has changed since then."
Yeah. If he were Boban he might get away w/ it.  Dude's slower than Slow Mo Kyle Anderson.
Lyles looked like a young Kyle Anderson with that burst
I have Kyle Anderson and Brandon Clarke üò¨
Lol kyle anderson and hb aren‚Äôt bad and rodney hood is solid when healthy. More like disappointing players
Garrett Temple  Rodney Hood  Kyle Anderson  Semi Ojeleye  Harrison Barnes
Got that Kyle Anderson type energy. Shouldn't be able to get past anybody with their slow asses but they do
"The thing that scares and confuses me about him is that he‚Äôs a good vertical athlete, but his foot speed and first step sometimes looks Kyle Anderson level."
DiVincenzo looking like [Kyle Anderson](https://streamable.com/vv7yn6).
Kyle Anderson looks like someone fucked with Jesse Williams‚Äô face and forehead in MyCareer
"Be honest guys, is Kyle Anderson using a stand?"
Kyle Anderson just Euroed into a lob. Not sure if I‚Äôve ever seen that before
"Kyle anderson is so smooth, love his confidence this year"
I thought Kyle Anderson was gonna be nice coming outta UCLA
"My man, learning that Kyle Anderson is slow and is nicknamed ""Slo-Mo"" isn't a  deep dive. That's literally the only thing I've known about him for the last five years."
"We actually shoot a lot of floaters too. Ja, Tyus Jones, Brandon Clarke, Grayson Allen, and kyle Anderson all like those little push shots. JV does a lot of post fades too avoiding contact"
I just can't stop watching Kyle Anderson chill on fast breaks
"Cmon bro how can you forget Kyle Anderson, he's got a sick nickname"
"That pass to Kyle Anderson in the corner near the end looked like cgi almost, it was so perfect lol"

1. Tyrese Halliburton  2. Duncan Robinson  3. Kyle Anderson  4. Zion  5. Turner
No but if you sort by FGA against bron on stats.nba hes been mainly contesting derizan but then guys like keldon Johnson kyle anderson Brandon Clarke etc
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
"Man he'd be a perfect fit next to Ja and JJJ  I think the best we could give em would be Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, and a bunch of picks which probably isn't gonna scratch that itch."
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
Thats what happens when you guard kyle anderson and ben mclemore
"Kyle Anderson and it‚Äôs not close. Who has been the steady hand to guide the injury plagued Grizzlies to a three game win streak? Kyle Anderson, that‚Äôs who."
Kyle Anderson and it‚Äôs not close
Juancho leaving about 10 feet between him and Kyle Anderson helped start that early.
"When Kyle Anderson hit that walk up three, it was over."
Trevor Ariza lol. That might be the best bet. Maybe Kyle Anderson.   If there is a worthwhile wing though was just thinking Seth Curry is a good enough asset you could probably flip him and something else for it.
"Kyle Anderson, i just love how slow he is but suceeds to get points"
"They show up in sweat pants and a sweater when it‚Äôs hot af in the gym, you‚Äôre probably thinking this old mans crazy. Then they ball out, in a slow, methodical, Kyle Anderson typa way"
Do you really think Kyrie has no natural advantages whatsoever? My boy Kyle Anderson could‚Äôve had those handles if he just put a little work in smh.
Just look up Kyle Anderson fast break on YouTube

Why is Kyle Anderson so damn funny
"Yeah his defence on Pat Williams, Kyle Anderson and Josh Okogie has been so impressive."
Someone please clip that Kyle Anderson flop on the jump ball
"Ha ha, that wasn't even a Euro by Danny Green just a Kyle Anderson-style glacially slow layup."
"Lonnie kind of needed it. I think the best method would have been more Austin time to be honest, but Spurs had a need for an athletic wing. Now they have Johnson and Vassell so even though Lonnie still is the most athletic he doesn't stand out as vastly since the team is a lot more athletic compared to last iteration.   Vassell has the most raw potential, but what's seen already is pretty solid. Both Vassell and Haliburton both already look like they are NBA players. To me, Vassell's potential could make him a star with all his abilities, but that part is the potential.   Lonnie gives me hope but he did have to wise up, which is has been doing and it looks like it's paying off. I can't say Pop is totally right, because it's likely somewhere in the middle, but he's also not fully wrong given Lonnie's need for some more guidance. I don't think Austin failed him as they still helped him grow, but Lonnie needed Pop to crack down on some of that. Short term sucks (kind of like Parker, Kyle Anderson, Danny Green), but longer term the pay off can be found.   Since Spurs aren't ""contenders"" for a while. I'm ok with the growing pains.   I still think Lonnie is the bubble (luke warm seat) player because they took another wing over someone like Halliburton. But Vassell was solid and the ""potential"" part is there.  I'm happy with the team so all my comments are mostly nitpicks and observations. I think Spurs are moving at the right pace since the bubble. Prior (last season), definitely some moments that made me question some things."
"Spurs have taken Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Keldon Johnson with the 29th picks. Hell of a run there."

Kyle Anderson
I think it‚Äôs just a smartass shit post of a tweet. I doubt it has anything to do with his financial situation or how stupid his gamble was. He basically just stated that Ryan Anderson has more money than he does.  Edit: oops I said Ryan and not Kyle.
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"People not watching the Grizzlies wouldn't know but Kyle Anderson has been playing pretty well so far this season, pre season too. He's recovered from a long nagging shoulder injury and worked with a shot doctor in the off season. He's avg 16 a game right now but struggling to get his three to fall the way we were all promised."
$15 an hour and you feel comfortable dropping nearly 7 hours of work on the *chance* that Kyle Anderson of all people would score over 13.5 points lol.   Just doesn‚Äôt sound very fiscally responsible.
"Why would you gamble on Kyle Anderson, especially when you‚Äôre making minimum wage?"
Damn I would pay to see a eurostep clinic put on by Kyle Anderson and Jokic. When do the Nugs and Grizzlies play?
casually ignoring the fact that kyle anderson was intentionally fouling on this play and didn't get called for it
"Contrary to popular belief, Kyle Anderson got his nickname as being slow not because he plays slow but because he went to UCLA.  ‚úåÔ∏è  ‚úåÔ∏è  ‚úåÔ∏è"

Kyle Anderson would like a word

I'm going to review a lot of Kyle Anderson tape to verify this claim.

Kyle Anderson has one slower eurostep per game
Kyle Anderson want to know his location

Kyle Anderson has stepped up!
Kyle Anderson is the greatest player ever and there‚Äôs nothing that can convince me otherwise
I was planning on getting a Jaren Jackson jersey this season but I might just be picking up a Kyle Anderson one instead.
CARMELO said Kyle Anderson was worth a max contract in the 2018 offseason and that right now DeMar is worth 3.5M/year
I have one career year Kyle Anderson
maybe they can get Kyle Anderson to jump over a shark
It's because he doesn't look explosive. Like a much better version of Kyle Anderson.
"Amazing roster building by Jason Wexler. All the main pieces are 25 or under.     Even the elder statesmen of the team, Jonas Valanciunas and Kyle Anderson, are just 28 and 27. Future certainly is bright!"
Fox and Kyle Anderson so we have Fast Forward and Slo-mo on the same team.
"Why are people saying Spurs? Their past 5 picks have been good, not great. Vassell, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, who else am I missing? None of these guys are really *great*. The answer here is quite easily Denver."
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"I'm pretty sure he's below average for the NBA lol.  Like honestly how many players at the size are slower than him at the moment? Kyle Anderson, Robinson, Bertans, and Draymond are the only answers that come to mind. A lot of 6'7"" players that get no minutes are quite athletic that just lack the skills."
add Kyle Anderson to the mix
Kyle Anderson gonna be the goat someday
Add kyle anderson and I think the universe will implode
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
"Yeah I agree Boston doesn't have the assets to make a workeable deal and I genuinely dont even think Boston wants such a heavy investment in the center position anyway.

But like if Memphis called offering like Jonas Valanciunas + Dillon Brooks + Kyle Anderson + 3 1sts (1 being Utah's, 1 being GSW) for Vuc + Fournier, I definitely think  Orlando should listen in that scenario."
"clown me all you want but i still own property on winslow island. if he can just get his injuries figured out. i firmly believe he can be a real real good wing for memphis.  i aint tryna rag on kyle anderson or anything since hes lowkey one of my fav players, but if fucking slo mo of all people can become a decent player offensively.... come ooonnn lmao. winslow can get to that level imo"
Terry Rozier and Kyle Anderson should both be in the discussion IMO.
Kyle Anderson is shooting 40% from three on 4 a game. Kyle Anderson!!
"That is not stacked  Stacked is  MVP LeBron James  FMVP Dwyane Wade  AllNBA Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  ALL NBA Kevin Love  Kyrie Irving  Tristan Thompson  Jr Smith  Kyle Korver  MVP AND DPOY CANDIDATE /ALLNBA Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Rajon Rondo  KCP  Former DPOY Marc Gasol  6MOY CAN DENNIS  6MOY MONTREZL  Caruso  Etc  Vs   Patrick Bev, EG, Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson... lol. LeBron has been loaded with HOF on his team."
When does Kyle 'Slowmo' Anderson enter the MVP Race?  I say now.
Kyle Anderson and Greyson Allen running the show over Ja this year probably had pretty high odds in Vegas.
"Ja Triple Double, you hear me?!?  I officially nominate Kyle Anderson for MIP.  God we need to get healthy it's so hard to close quarters without all the guys we're missing"
Kyle Anderson this season has become the must watch tv guy on our squad instead of Ja. Dude can score from anywhere and get anywhere he wants with his unique version of bipedal movement.
Kyle Anderson lives in the slow lane.
Dont trade suite life of zach and coby just get a kyle Anderson or a pg in a 3s body.
"My centers are on point this year. Actually, if I can brag, I think my whole team is on point  Wall (pg)  Dejounte murray (pg/sg)  Donovan mitchell (pg/sg)  Vanvleet (pg/sg)  Huerter (sg/sf) (holding until levert recovers)  Hayward (sf)  Kyle Anderson (sf/pf)  Tatum (sf/pf)  Bam (pf/c)  Hortford (pf/c)  Drummond (c)"
"You fuckin slow or something?  JV went out of his way to dismount onto CoJo, obviously - you can even see Kyle Anderson giggling at the whole scenario.  This happened immediately after Metu did it to him, and was intended as a message, in the same way throwing Metu off him was a message.  Most big guys are accustomed to getting dunked on from time to time, but if you're going to be disrespectful towards them you best expect them to come back at you with the same lack of respect.  Honestly, I miss this kind of intensity.  A lot of ppl are picking sides on this, i love it from both guys.  Metu got some balls to try something like that, and frankly I respect the way he handled it, seemingly acknowledging his own part in it and not taking the shove too personally.  Was dangerous for sure, glad to see everyone healthy at the end."
"Role players on non contending teams get underrated.  For example a guy like Richaun Holmes is better than a lot of starting centers in the NBA.  Kyle Anderson is a great defender, a good passer/pnr operator and this year he's even shooting well on decent volume, he'd be a starter on a lot of contenders, but he's on the Grizzlies so nobody cares.  Valanciunas is better than he was on Toronto, but he's not on a contender anymore so nobody cares.  Justin Holiday is an elite 3&amp;D guy, legit one of the best in the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other end role players on elite teams either get overrated/overhyped (Beverley, Caruso, Horton Tucker, DiVincenzo...) Or some often get overscrutinized  (KCP, Danny Green,...)"
LeBron's missed dunk on Kyle Anderson in the first half could've been sooo nice.
"Lol yeah I can‚Äôt lie, did feel like the refs were trying to keep us in the game through the third. Kyle Anderson definitely should‚Äôve got continuation on that one shot, although I don‚Äôt blame the refs too much on that one when Slowmo is so unorthodox with his rhythm."
"Kyle Anderson got a good, slow motion look at that fadeaway"
Glad to know the rest of the nation is getting to watch Kyle Anderson tonite.
How was that not an and-1 continuation earlier with Kyle Anderson? He had gathered.
Kyle Anderson is not a random scrub at all. Plays a huge role on the Memphis offense.

Kyle Anderson for MVP. Didn't expect for the Grizz to set the franchise record for 3s today!
"Kyle ""So anyway, I started blasting"" Anderson"

6/8 shooting from three for Kyle Anderson?
Kyle Anderson is your favorite player's favorite player
I think Kyle Anderson has figured out that Charlotte can't see him if he moves slowly enough. They're giving him so much space on offense lol
Where were you for the Kyle Anderson game?
"How is he so slow but so good. Him and Kyle Anderson make no sense to me.  Fun fact: Kyle Anderson was the starting PG in college over Zach Lavine, who was drafted many places above Kyle Anderson."
"You can't stop him. You can only hope to contain him. Also, I'm looking forward to kyle Anderson vs Joe Ingles whenever they match up next"
Him and Kyle Anderson should team up.
"He's like Kyle Anderson, their slow speed throws defenders off."
Kyle Anderson
kyle anderson LOL
I think that means the team is average when the shooting stats are similar to Kyle Anderson.
I guess Kyle Anderson is the goat
He‚Äôs just doing his best Kyle Anderson impression
"Kyle is officially listed at 6'9"", which means without shoes. I'd say ~3"" is enough to point out a difference, especially since Anderson has a ridiculous 7'2"" wingspan on top of that."
He's pretty good. Posts up a lot which for a 6'5 SG i don't know how that's gonna go in the NBA but he's a very well rounded player. Best comparison i have is smaller Kyle Anderson

"Kyle Anderson would‚Äôve been so much better for you guys, would be such a sick fit next to Curry. He has the IQ to handle the Warriors system tbh. Would‚Äôve gave you guys a solid 15/7/4 with good defence and a very controlled game"
At least Kyle Anderson is called SLO MO
"Brook ""Kyle Anderson"" Lopez"
"For whatever reason that 2018ish roster of Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, Bryan Forbes and Derrick White all seemed like one interchangeable person."
He will add Kyle Anderson to the mix.
"I wonder if Kyle Anderson has a condition/handicap we don't know about (but the league does), so players just let him score like that, kind of like how when you let your little bro score to big him up"
We always say this but I feel like more guys than not recognize their role on the team because they realize how good all these other guys are once they get to the league. I strongly doubt like Kyle Anderson thinks he‚Äôs the best player on the Grizzlies
Who is Kyle Anderson
"The Warriors are not fucked at all, the post KD era has actually been orchestrated beautifully for the most part. Replacing Durant leaving with a valuable DLo Russell.   Trading DLo for Wiggins was a huge risk but the potential from it could be massive especially if the Warriors get their pick in the upcoming stacked draft. Wiggins has shown a ton of upside during his stay on the Warriors, he will probably stay on the Warriors for the rest of his contract unless he becomes so good that he's considered worth the money at which point they could sell high on him.   It isn't the GMs fault that Klay Thompson gets injured AGAIN after a bad injury in the finals already. $35.6 million dollars going to waste sucks. I mean are you forgetting this BIG factor? Thompson is the second option on this team. The Warriors just don't have money to spend for good rotation pieces. At best they could downgrade Wiggins to a few guys on smaller contracts (maybe a Grizzlies trade for JV and Kyle Anderson). They could consider dangling that Minnesota pick in there too. The Grizzlies have a ton of great rotation pieces to give out.   This year sucks, it sucks to watch Curry in his prime waste a year. It happened to LeBron in his last year on the Cavs and his first on the Lakers. It's pretty much unavoidable though, especially with Klay out. Next year the Warriors should be looking very interesting. They'll be off Oubre and might be able to bring in someone else, hopefully they'll have a good draft selection, and the new guys will have had time to build chemistry. The 2021 Warriors could be viewed as comparable to the 2019 Lakers where there's a ton of potential but it isn't moving quick enough but one good move could be on the horizon to turn them into a team comparable to the 2020 Lakers."

"Kyle ""The Flash"" Anderson"
"Certain guys like Kyle Anderson, Jokic, McCollum, Harden, Kyrie, SGA, are really good at controlling the tempo and masterfully always keeping the defender trapped playing their game.  My all time favorite player at this was Andre Miller, he was one of the best guards in the post because of it and how he had that ‚Äúold man game‚Äù which translates to being able to dictate the pace of how the play unfolds."

This dude was the reason I didn't writeoff Doncic for being unathletic.  Kyle Anderson didn't even shoot the 3 until this year. It's mindblowing that he makes it work.
He got totally outplayed by Kyle Anderson today
Kyle Anderson gets me.
I seriously can't stop laughing at this. I love Kyle Anderson so much because the dude is an enigma. Look at how Harris could literally disengage him and just sprint to the basket but instead actually *slows down to keep up with him*. The shit is out of a damn comedy movie
"Man I knew Kyle Anderson was having a career year, but holy hell is he playing well."
"giannis can play all five, jokic can handle and pass like a guard, charles barkley actually played all five, kyle anderson played guard/point forward for the spurs  and yet none of them move like guards or playmake like guards when they actually play that position. and none would be considered as moving like guards  ""being used at all 5 positions"" and ""he can play some point for us"" doesnt equal moving like a guard.  that would be 7' kd moving like chris paul the same way 6'6 and 6'9 kobe and tmac could and did"

"Kyle Anderson is one of my favorite players. Gotta love someone with absolutely no explosive athleticism just casually glide their way through a game.

Kyle Anderson
Westbrook Love year was good. Recently they definitely haven't gotten the NBA talent they used to. 13-14 season was good with Lavine Kyle Anderson and Norm Powell but all the talent seems to be rotation players outside of Lavine. They really haven't gotten a star* player in a few years.
"I still can't get over those Final Four teams--3 consecutive years and we couldn't come up with a championship.  I'm happy for so many of those guys who had/have decent NBA careers.  Not stars like WB and Love, but guys like Norm Powell, Ariza, Looney, Kyle Anderson, who have a few years (17 for Ariza!) in the league and are financially set for life.  And Lavine is turning into a star too."
Damn you didn‚Äôt have to kill Kyle Anderson like that
kyle anderson
"Man, how is Kyle Anderson -2 in a game where he shot 6 for 7 with no turnovers?  I guess 3 rebounds is kinda low for a power forward, was that the problem?  Because I feel like getting your PF to give you 3 assists and 0 turnovers on top of 6/7 shooting and 3 credible 3 point threat for spacing is great."

Slo Mo (Kyle Anderson)
"&gt; Kyle M. Anderson figured his landscapers might turn up some unusual items when they began digging up the backyard on his recently purchased property in Cape May based on what he knew about the previous owner. &gt;  &gt; He certainly didn‚Äôt expect workers to find what turned out to be two World War II ordnances earlier this week, though. And if that wasn‚Äôt jarring enough, a third was uncovered on Thursday morning after a bomb disposal team took the first two explosives to a nearby beach and detonated them Thursday, according to Anderson and police. &gt;  &gt; Anderson thought the first two items were just projectiles and didn‚Äôt give them much more thought until he swung by the property Wednesday and learned that a painter working in the house had flagged down police. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúI knew we‚Äôd find stuff,‚Äù said Anderson, the father of former St. Anthony High School basketball star Kyle F. Anderson who now plays for the NBA‚Äôs Memphis Grizzlies. ‚ÄúWhen I bought the house back in October, the neighbor on the other side had warned me (the former owner) used to bury a lot of stuff. The yard is lumpy and uneven and when the landscapers came, I advised them there will be things buried back there.‚Äù &gt;  &gt; He also shared a photo online of a large urinal that was unearthed in the yard excavation. &gt;  &gt; The two ordnances found in a backyard were safely detonated by the Atlantic City Bomb Squad at a nearby beach, according to police. Police evacuated several residents as the bombs were removed around 3 p.m. &gt;  &gt; The bomb squad was headed back to the yard around 11:45 a.m. Thursday, Chief Dekon W. Fashaw Sr. said. The chief said metal detectors are likely to be used to determine if there‚Äôs anything else buried. &gt;  &gt; One of the former owners is John A. Trolli, who died at 89 in August. Trolli served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1952 to 1954 and received the National Defense Service Medal, according to his online obituary. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúBefore he passed away last year, I had always told him I always told I‚Äôd like to buy that property since it‚Äôs adjacent to my home,‚Äù said Anderson, who taught in Jersey City‚Äôs public schools for more than 30 years before retiring last year and now lives full-time in Cape May one street away. &gt;  &gt; The younger Anderson was a McDonald‚Äôs All-American in leading St. Anthony to a pair of Tournament of Champions titles and undefeated records in two consecutive seasons. He played two years at UCLA before being selected by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2014 NBA Draft. Anderson signed with the Grizzlies in 2018."
"In what way was Grizzlies roster awful last year? They started Valanƒçi≈´nas, who is a double-double machine, JJJ - 7-footer who shot 40 % from three, Crowder who is a solid 3nD guy and Brooks, who had a career season that year. Plus their bench was deep aswell with the likes of Clarke, Tyus Jones, Melton, Grayson Allen and Kyle Anderson who all proved to be solid contributors in their NBA careers."
I feel like this was written years ago. Mbah a Moute over Kyle Anderson?
"I have half your team on my fantasy lol. Ja, JV, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones (for that one week where he was hot as hell), JJJ, Clarke.  It‚Äôs my job to care"
We'll probably end up getting blindsided by Kyle Anderson.
"Spurs always have these random guys that play well because Pop makes everybody play well, then leaves the Spurs, gets exposed and just fell off. Jonathan Si is another who went to Orlando Magic and gg.  which is why I‚Äôm impressed by Kyle anderson. I thought he would be another case like that for sure."
"I feel like the spurs have a ton of those guys, Boban, Kyle Anderson, Jonathan Simmons, Aron Baynes, Bertans"

"&gt; How many times have Lakers fans tried to include Kuzma in trades? Why sign Blake Griffin when Nick Claxton is a good young player you need to discover how to fit in the system?   Because Claxton is a project that might require years to develop and the Nets want to win now?  Because Kuzma has probably reached his potential as a player and Lakers also want to continue winning?  If we could flip young Kyle Anderson and Cory Joseph back in 2014-15 say for 34 years old Pau Gasol, I'd be fucking ecstatic."
Who you got? Jonas? Kyle Anderson?  I think you might be right. I just think he would need to be if they were to beat anyone in a series.
A mixture of Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson most likely.

Randle and Clarkson should be the first two but my homer pick is Kyle Anderson. All his numbers are way up across the board now that he‚Äôs finally healthy

"On the benches are Kyle Anderson, Enes Kanter, Seth Curry, Derrick Favors, Patty Mills, and Nerlens Noel."

nah but maybe kyle anderson
Kyle Anderson no question
"I personally am pretty in the middle on it. I think Westbrook is one of the scariest players to see my team go up against, yet he‚Äôs one of the superstar players I‚Äôd want least on my team (even if we didn‚Äôt have Ja) because the rest of the roster has to be designed to work with him and the grizzlies have never really had that roster (except I think Kyle Anderson would go GREAT on a Russ team).   My only personal critique outside of the efficiency concerns every 4th year or so is that he picks the rebound over the break a few times a game and there have been times they lost by 2-6 points and he has 14 rebounds but 4 fast break points. This is a 4-6 game a season thing and held to the same standard, I‚Äôve got a laundry list of issues with Ja currently. Still think he‚Äôs one of the greatest ever and like I said never wanna see my team face him."

"You're missing the Grizzlies, honestly.  They have a star point guard and very capable back-up PG in Morant and Tyus Jones.  As an OKC-Jazz fan, I envy their options at SG: two-way menace Dillon Brooks, sharpshooter Grayson Allen, advanced stats darling and defensive ace DeAnthony Melton, flamethrower-type of shooter Desmond Bane and John Konchar who is a lot better than people realize since he's buried down the depth chart (he could be a reliable regular back-up on some teams).  At small forward, they have options due to Justise Winslow (who's in a slump) and Kyle Anderson. But this is the only position where they could use more strength, even though Brooks, Konchar and Bane could play the position in a small-ball lineup.  Big man/PF rotation is something to envy: one of the most underrated centers in Valanciunas, potential star JJJ, Tillman, Clarke, even Jontay Porter is somewhat interesting as a prospect (would looove to have him on Jazz or OKC).  Honestly, hats off to their GM."
Kyle Anderson has competition for his SloMo title
"Kyle Anderson, be on notice."
"It's got some pretty obvious flaws just looking at players on the same teams.   First example I see looking at the charts is Donte DiVicenzo has a 2.27 RPM. Jrue's is a little bit over him at 2.49 and Khris is just underneath him at 1.96. It's hard to imagine how Donte is even roughly as impactful as the other two players.   Devonte Graham is at a 3.72 vs Scary Terry's 2.77 and Ball is at 1.15 and Hayward is at 1.13. I don't think anyone would consider Graham as significantly more impactful than the other players.   Joe Harris ranks above Kyrie but the really baffling part is that Harris is a negative in offense by this metric and just blows Kyrie out of the water defensively while Kyrie is good on offense and just barely positive in defense.   Outside of the realm of teammates, you have some very big ones. Lonzo is the 9th most impactful player. Duncan Robinson rates as a better shooting guard than Lavine and Brown and Spyda. Danny Green and Kyle Anderson are the 5th and 6th best small forwards by this metric.   This whole spiel just to say that it's a wonky stat that isn't trustworthy"
"Kyle Anderson is legit, man been damn good for me in fantasy lol."
"Kyle Anderson somehow pretty damn solid too lol, man been killin it for me in fantasy all year."
"Similar to why Bobi doesn't get real minutes.  Tacko is just TOO big.  He can rack up a shitload of garbage time blocks because end of bench players go out of their way to try and dunk on him which is damn near impossible, but during regular game action when it matters he's a pretty big liability because he's just super slow.  Any coach worth their salt will scheme to get him out on the perimeter where even a dude like Kyle Anderson could cook him.  Tacko might be the first player ever who would get BETTER if you made him a few inches shorter.  He's actually pretty quick and coordinated for his size, but there's a limit to how quick and coordinated you can be when your legs are so damn long that it takes 3 minutes to take a step.  If he was like 7'2"" and 30 pounds Iighter with similar agility I think he could actually be a rotational piece.  He'd still have a monstrous wingspan to work with (he's currently a +11"" so even if he lost a couple of inches there he'd still have damn near 8 feet of wingspan) on top of being able to get around more effectively."
Dude out here looking like Kyle Anderson x Bol Bol.
Or Kyle Anderson on 1.5x
Watch out Kyle Anderson
We just need Boban to mentor Tacko on his touch as a big man and Kyle Anderson to teach him how to hypnotize opponents with his slow ass moves and we'll have our MVP

"Kyle Anderson has been great this season. He's a dude that just fills up the stat sheet. You look down and he's got a 12-15 point game, 8 rebounds, and like 4 or 5 assists and barely even notice it. Very happy with how Kyle has played this year. Even shooting the three ball at ~35% on 3.8 attempts per game which is a huge leap forward for him."

"Grizzlies try to get 30 assists a game (as you know, to do that there has to be a lot of right passes being made), Jonas is pretty dependable for a double double, and Deanthony Melton and Kyle Anderson have been consistently fundamentally solid.

Crazy how the spurs are lowkey going to lose both of their stars (Aldridge and Derozan) while getting nothing in return. Aldrdige should've been traded a year ago and Derozan should've been traded at the deadline. The Spurs have fallen to below average status FO wise the last few years.   This all goes back to the Spurs trading Kawhi for nothing. The spurs would've been way better off sitting kawhi and retaining Green. We also let Kyle Anderson go for nothing. Signed Pau Gasol to a ridiculous contract. And got cheated by Morris.
Kyle Anderson very unique gamestyle will be easy to distinguish

"He plays more violently but they‚Äôve even joked about how they aren‚Äôt sure who would be faster in a race, Jokic is surprisingly fast/quick when he really tries, he just benefits from slowing it down because he can‚Äôt maintain that speed at his size for more than occasional bursts. But it‚Äôs just super hard to be fast (and especially to look fast or quick) with a frame that massive.   He‚Äôs like a wind turbine, looks super slow but part is that of just because they‚Äôre huge, you don‚Äôt want to get in the way of the spinning tip. Also dudes like Kyle Anderson exist"
Impossible to guard kyle anderson on transition

"No he‚Äôs more ball dominant cus the hawks have like zero other people who can facilitate lmao. Kyle Anderson and tyus Jones are both great passers, and literally everyone else besides the bigs are able passers, this is why the grizzlies are top3 in assists and also why a lot of plays don‚Äôt run through Ja. You just don‚Äôt watch grizzlies games so you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Put tre on the Grizz and his assists either stay the same or go down because he‚Äôd be able to share the ball more and not have to rely on isos so much.

We were actually kind of worried that we wouldn't be able to afford him this offseason. The problem with Niang though is that he plays at a very slow pace a la Kyle Anderson/Joe Ingles, but when the game speeds up come playoff time, Niang simply isn't as skilled as those guys to respond to the increased speed."
"Simmons for Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Deanthony Melton and a first.  Who says no"
Obligatory joke response: either Kyle Anderson or Zaza
Kyle Anderson
"&gt;Ah yes Lebron was being destroyed with 28/7/4 with 2 steals a game on 57/52/80 splits  4-1, largest point differential in NBA HISTORY at the time.  Since when do players get praised for garbage points, since when do we criticize players for their dominance?  Never.    &gt;You say KD has never done anything close to Kawhi in his career but I didn't see Kawhi put up 32 ppg on 50/40/90 splits with shit spacing and win MVP as he led a bad team to 60 wins due to Russ being out   Lol Russ still played 46 games &amp; OKC was still loaded, even their role players like Kendrick Perkins used to trouble Tim Duncan, see yall don't remember any of this.  Kawhi was winning 67 &amp; 61 games without a single superstar next to his side, the only time KD could ever win 67 was joining a 73 win team.   &gt;Out of his 6 years making the playoffs in OKC, he led in playoff ppg in 4 of those.   WB was the #1 option, the player coaches &amp; teams game planned for, KD was just a sniper that picked off easy shots.  Go back &amp; watch these series, I still remember him drawing Kyle Anderson a rookie because WB demanded Kawhi's attention, that's KD's career for you."
The game is slower than a Kyle Anderson fast break.
"You think it's okay to harass a coach and abuse other players if you're winning?   As I've already said, you've quite clearly got one hell of a fucked up perception of reality if you take a recreational sport so seriously and treat it like war - i.e. people who would be mad at a coach when a player attacked the coach are misplacing their blame. The player is obviously the problem.Not being able to lose and stay calm is a sign of bad mental health.   Anyways I'm pretty sure Tim Duncan won a quite few championships and had one of the best careers of all time without being a dickhead which just shows that being a dick isn't a pre-requisite for winning basketball. (obviously)  The kings also have some ""dogs"" on their team and they still lose because their FO is trash and they're just not as good at basketball as other teams.    ANYWAYS  your idea that a woman cannot deal with that toxic environment is STILL blatantly sexist and smallminded - and that's why you're getting downvoted.  No wonder you guys lost to Memphis, Kyle Anderson is just more of a dog than Draymond right? lol"
"Biden walking through the white house like he's kyle anderson ""running"" a fastbm break"
Kyle Anderson is no scrub
yea i have no idea what this sub's fascination is with putting side by side's with Kobe. Wow a pump fake and a jumper? even fucking kyle anderson has probably hit a few of these llol
"Teams aren‚Äôt rebuilding forever. If you are the Cavs, Bulls etc and if you are looking for 3-4 contracts you should be thinking that you might be playoff team in 1-2 years, so it technically won‚Äôt be a rebuilding team far into future.  And yes you are right on that second point. It‚Äôs really up to the GM to do due diligence on the player. Role player contracts can also win you championship as well as lose them. I can think of 20+ role player signings that were immediately thought as overpaid and then worked out to be undervalued even in year one.  Some examples in the past 3-4 years: Terry Rozier, Kyle Anderson, Julius Randle, Jae Crowder (3-4 times lol), Seth Curry, PJ Tucker etc"
Kyle Anderson
"I still remember Gobert walking over to bump kyle Anderson then flop AFTER he fouled out , also banging on the Matt cuz he thought he didn‚Äôt get a call, dude has some weird complex.. maybe napoleonic üòÇ"
This makes me sad that Kyle Anderson isn't on the Nuggets
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I‚Äôm not giving you names of point guards to add. I don‚Äôt want to invest in point guard. I don‚Äôt want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in adding‚Ä¶ Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
The Kyle Anderson fast break.
The Kyle Anderson Effect
who is the all-slo mo team  Kyle Anderson and Jokic gotta be starters
Kyle Anderson 2022 MVP mark my words
I think you mean Kyle Anderson
Fully fledged 7'0 Kyle Anderson
"how? JV, Morant, Kyle Anderson are all non threatening shooters"
"People will hate what you said, but I also like players who get the most out of what they‚Äôre genetically given. Kyle Anderson, Andre Miller, Isaiah Thomas, Larry Bird, Luka Doncic etc etc etc.  The least likable are the Andre Drummonds or Wolves Wiggins or any other player with everything except heart."
"I think it's a combination of things. While some can be attributed to the oddities of this past season, some will need to be addressed by the league in the form of either shorter seasons, more rest days, or something else.  Short off-season: Pretty self-explanatory. Both Finals teams were gassed by the regular season start and most teams that had deep runs last season had major injuries to key players.  COVID-19: Long stretches where players couldn't play (or participate in team practices) because of protocol meant that they came back relatively rusty and had to get up to speed again. Not an issue if you're a deep bench guy, but definitely a load management issue if you normally play heavy minutes. If a player was positive for COVID, that likely has lasting consequences too (e.g. Tatum saying he was winded for a while after returning).  Pushing athletic extremes: Every year, the league sees an arms race as everyone (except Kyle Anderson) tries to jump as high as possible, be as quick as possible, break ankles, and more to compete with the best. Also, pace increasing means guys have to score and defend on more possessions, they have to get out in transition more on both sides, and more. Additionally, increased team play and off-ball movement means guys are just moving a lot more than before, when teams just chucked it into their big man and watched them go to work. Sacrifices have to be made for a beautiful game.  Physicality: Making it harder to play physical defense means that defenders have to be even quicker and more precise in their movements, leading to more wear and tear on joints. I put this separately from pushing athletic extremes because this is something that can be officiated."
"I don‚Äôt know about that. There were a lot of hustle plays both from the team and from individual players.  Last round, Nets ranked fifth in steals per game, fourth in blocks, deflections, and charges drawn, in a tie for third most defensive loose balls recovered, sixth in contested 3s, and seventh in contested shots and 2 pointers.  Harden was tied with kcp for most defensive loose balls recovered per game and had the seventh most deflections. He also had 2 steals per game which was more than anyone but Kyle Anderson, Kawhi, and Jrue. And he had a block per game tied with Kawhi and above Simmons/Ayton/Giannis. KD was tied in third with Capela for most blocks per game with 2.2 and was tied in 14th for steals with 1.4 but so far against the bucks, he‚Äôs gone down to 1.5 blocks, 1 steal, and half the deflections.  Not saying they were trying all the time or going all out but they were definitely putting some effort in."
I mean Kyle Anderson is still in the league so probably not
Memphis because I love Kyle Anderson more than I love  95% of my family
You gotta have decent quickness for deceleration to throw people off.  Unless you're Kyle Anderson.
"Yeah, because no one has ever made a comment about how a black player, plays slow. https://deadspin.com/i-love-watching-kyle-anderson-do-hilariously-slow-baske-1824286539"
"It‚Äôs not sexy, but as a Mavs fan I wanted a guy like Kyle Anderson as part of the core around Luka."
"Christ, everyone who plays in San Antonio isn't a system player getting propped up by Pop. The only thing that changed in DeMar's game in San Antonio is him improving his playmaking and shooting slightly less. Why would that not carryover to a new team?  And this narrative that players in San Antonio leaving and getting exposed elsewhere hasn't been true for a while. Kawhi, Danny Green, Bryn Forbes, Kyle Anderson, and Davis Bertans have all had success since leaving in the past few years. Take Pop off this pedestal."
How many Games did Kyle Anderson play
He‚Äôs a Spurs fan who is prolly upset Kyle Anderson was balling out in the 1st round while Spurs didn‚Äôt make the playoffs
I‚Äôm convinced Danilo is slower than Kyle Anderson
That‚Äôs a Kyle Anderson fast break if I‚Äôve ever seen one
"Dang thanks for the -5 downvotes everyone even though there are black players with the last name smith and Anderson, Ish Smith, Kyle Anderson"
"Brook lopez is a beast in post easily but playing with giannis, he changed his role.   His paint protection is great but he isn't a shot blocking machine even when he basically live in paint and easily exploited by anyone that is faster than Kyle Anderson."
Kyle Anderson. Dude a walking bucket.
Kyle Anderson  Like the whole key to his success is being so different from everyone else it confuses defenders.
Kyle Anderson aka Slomo. Literally no one like him. 6'9 with a 7'3 wingspan btw
Kyle Anderson and Robin Lopez
Kyle Anderson confirmed immortal
In slo mo like Kyle Anderson
"I'm gonna go waaay out there and say Kyle Anderson. No one talks about him, but he really stepped up his game this year."
Lmao Kyle Anderson catching strays for no reason
Kyle Anderson would‚Äôve gotten a steal.
don't disrespect Kyle Anderson like that c'mon now
The most egregious was when he spent the Suns fast break and most of the shot clock arguing with the refs and walking like Kyle Anderson back on D. Embarrassing
I need a Jokic vs Kyle Anderson full court race.
Kyle Anderson
"Its like Kyle Anderson, he probably has the slowest pace in the NBA, but when he goes for a [fastbreak](https://youtu.be/RM7Fa0K-7c8), everyone just slows down with him. He controlled Tobias' paced."
"boban vs slo-mo is the matchup the NBA needs to see, can the clippers trade for kyle anderson mid playoffs"
Kyle Anderson was our most impactful player this season and had a good Game 1 and 2 in Utah and the coach still has iced him out on minutes in the last 3 games. For Grayson.
Feel like Allen has played too many minutes and Kyle Anderson has played too few this series. Not enough Bane.
"Deandre Hunter, Dejounte Murray, Thybulle, Kyle Anderson, Lauri, Gallo"
I really don't think CJ has a lot of trade value. I don't see sixers trading for him. Imo CJ is like a guard version of  tobias harris. Maybe they can send CJ + picks to the spurs for demar. Or send CJ to Memphis for Kyle Anderson + Brandon Clarke
This is actually Kyle Anderson wearing a Chris Paul costume
"Every role players ""graduated"" from Spurs are somehow able to perform with great basketball IQ, play ball the right way, are reliable and able to stick in the league for quite a while.  Garrett Temple  Gary Neal  Kyle Anderson  Cory Joseph  Danny Green"
"Shai doesn't remind me of anyone except oddly, Kyle Anderson.  They have a similar deliberate style, where they're not super fast but very controlled and move at a pace that throws off defenders.  Shai is much better offensively but they move in the same way."
Is there a bigger contrast in athleticism than between Westbrook and Kyle Anderson?
Jokic and Kyle Anderson   The fact that you can be that slow and and still kill people is just amazing.
It‚Äôs spooky hours for the grizzlies if they get a starting SF that can stretch the floor this off season. I like Kyle Anderson but imagine the spacing for Ja if they can play with 3 shooters and Jonas.
I think Nurk is the second best player on the Blazers. Harris might be better than Simmons at this point. I‚Äôd probably do a lineup of:  Kyrie Irving  Jrue Holiday  Andrew Wiggins  Kyle Anderson (or any 3&amp;D PF)  Ayton
I‚Äôd take Kyle Anderson. Pretty much all of our guards need a lesson on staying in front of the player on defense
"Why does Kyle Anderson, the slowest guy on the court, not simply...  I don't know how to finish that reference. How does he keep getting steals."
If you get blown by by Kyle Anderson you should get fined
KYLE ANDERSON WHAT A PASS
CP3 and Kyle Anderson
"Thybule from 76ers, Joe ingles, nerlens noel/taj Gibson, Kyle Anderson"
Ja had a not so great season. Again. Recency bias like the other user pointed out.   He was arguably their third best player throughout the season behind Jonas and Kyle Anderson.
Mini Kyle Anderson
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"

"I mean y'all made playoffs for like what? 5, 6 consecutive seasons so far? That is pretty experienced. On our team, the only playoff vets we have are Kyle Anderson and JV."
"Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks are both right up there when it comes to ""how the hell are this guy so good"""
"So many young players get lost in the sauce of playing ""cool"".   Kyle Anderson is exactly who you need to play like if you want a contract. Dude always plays hard, uses his head, amd doesn't over-do anything. It's not the sexiest way to play, but if you want to get paid, that's how you do it"
kyle anderson is such a unique player. dude is super smart
"Kyle ""Arsene Lupin"" Anderson"
Hubie loooooves giving Brooks and Kyle Anderson a ton of credit
I'm so over Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson I think
Spurs fans like OH KYLE ANDERSON CAN WALK INTO TRANSITION THREES NOW
How much would Kyle Anderson make if he was a 40% 3pt shooter?  I‚Äôd bet a lot.
Is Kyle Anderson the slowest player in the league? Everything he does looks like it‚Äôs in slow motion
"Whenever someone asks me about my favorite comedy of all time, I‚Äôll simply tell them about Kyle Anderson doing 17 pump fakes on one possession."
kyle anderson is just black luka
Kyle ‚ÄúKobe Bryant‚Äù Anderson
Kyle Anderson just set an NBA record for pump fakes in one possession.
I love Kyle Anderson lmao
if you're too slow to get a shot off before Georges Niang closes you down from 10 feet away  you might be Kyle Anderson
were they showing kyle anderson fast break clips
"Becoming Draymond is basically impossible, but Barnes is one of the only guys that the comp actually makes sense as in the super optimistic ""this is what this guy looks like if he hits his best outcome"" kinda way.  Cause Barnes genuinely seems like a really strong defender and passer and good handler for guy his size.  But might be more reasonable to say Kyle Anderson or someone like that, who is more on par with the sort of player Barnes can reasonably expect to become."
No way Kyle Anderson is quicker
Khris Middleton or Kyle Anderson
"Valenciunas, Kyle Anderson and 17"
Yeah but scoring is what we need most of all and Green provides us that in bunches. I‚Äôm not super high on Mobley‚Äôs scoring chops tbh he seems like one of those one and done guys that get lost after their initial move doesn‚Äôt work. Think he‚Äôll wind up being Myles Turner on roids so I won‚Äôt necessarily be mad if we select him just kinda wondering what could‚Äôve been. Cause for me Greens floor is Zach Lavine and I don‚Äôt even know what his ceiling is. Also just not a fan of twin towers unless one of your bigs is a 40% shooter from deep which neither wood nor Mobley will ever be. Mobley‚Äôs shot is slower than Kyle Anderson stg.
Holliday with the Kyle Anderson slow break
"Jersey brings:  - Kyrie / Jalen Brunson - Deandre Bembry - Kyle Anderson - JJJ / Kenny Faried  - KAT / Bam / Naz  Shaq or JR coaching, either way it‚Äôs hilarious."
Don‚Äôt gotta be Usain bolt to play basketball‚Ä¶ you seen Luka ? Jokic ? Khris Middleton? Kyle Anderson ? You can be mvp by being ‚Äúslow as hell‚Äù
Cade is also like a tenth of the athlete that Simmons is. Dudes got the Kyle Anderson foot speed
"No team but NJ would have KAT/Bam/Naz Reid/Kyle Anderson/Jaylen Brunson/JJJ, Kyrie also played his HS ball here"
"He went for 29-3-3 in the Big 12 finals, but OSU did lose by 5.  Yeah for sure, all prospects can miss. I'm just saying that Cade is a lot more than a Kyle Anderson 2.0."
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
Cade is a better shooting Kyle Anderson. Yes. It‚Äôs pretty simple to see. He got abused by a 24 year old G leaguer in his biggest game of the year but we are supposed to pretend he‚Äôs some can‚Äôt miss kid.
"You mean the Kyle Anderson that averaged 14 ppg with less than 1 3pt made per game his sophomore year before being drafted 30th overall? Who didn't have to deal with teams keying exclusively on him because he played on a UCLA team with far more talent than the OSU team the Cade played on? You think that Cade Cunnigham's best comp is that Kyle Anderson?  (And I'm not hating on Kyle Anderson, he can hoop)"
I can.   Kyle Anderson.
"Grayson Allen, probably some combination of Tyus Jones/Kyle Anderson/Jonas Valanciunas/Deanthony Melton and one first round pick as needed. We have way too much depth and need to shorten our rotation"
"Lol. I did not know Cam can do that. Everytime I see him, I think he's Kyle Anderson 2.0."
Kyle Anderson has a shotput jumper and runs at mach 0. It's funny to watch tho
Kyle Anderson easily. Still a guy anyone would want on their team tho
Kyle Anderson without a doubt.
Kyle Anderson
"I wouldn‚Äôt mind the Grizzlies taking on some money people don‚Äôt want to get a better pick or young talent. For instance like trade 17 and whoever to NO for Bledsoe and 10.   I‚Äôm also open to moving Kyle Anderson  and/or JV to a contender for younger pieces. There was some wacky trade in an article that proposed sending the two of them to GSW for Wiseman, Wiggins and maybe something else I forget the specifics. A lot of Grizzlies fans scoffed at taking on Wiggins, but I think taking on his salary could be worth it to get a crack at Wiseman (plus Wiggins played pretty great this year). I don‚Äôt think Warriors would do this it‚Äôs just the type of trade I‚Äôm talking about."
Kyle Anderson
The Kyle Anderson play was the best lob ever imo
"Are you kidding me? DeSagana Diop, Erick Dampier and Dirk are some of the greatest defenders that ever lived. They were so fast, they made other big men look like Kyle Anderson."
Booker taking warm up advice from Kyle Anderson I see
"Luka aint the fastest player either. They have the same playstyle. They play to their own pace, similar to Kyle Anderson but to a much lower level. He still makes it work though. You cant discredit everything else Cade is able to provide just because hes a little slower."
That was the biggest flaw I saw in his game as well.  Kyle Anderson vibes.
That‚Äôs literally the Kyle Anderson special. He slows down so much on fast breaks his defenders trip themselves trying to get around
That‚Äôs A.) Disrespectful to Slo-Mo. He can hoop.  B.) Cade is way more like Shaun Livingston pre knee injury than Kyle Anderson.
CP3 with the savvy Kyle Anderson move haha
"We don't have a ton of flexibility, but a big wing/stretch 4 is a huge need on the team. Lots of our fans are throwing out Kyle Anderson trades, which I would love but I'm not sure Memphis would be interested."
PG: Ja Morant  SG: Dillon Brooks  SF: Kyle Anderson  PF: Jaren Jackson Jr  C: Jonas Valencunias
"Most of these are pretty solid. I‚Äôd say Suggs is more Holiday, less shooting but more athleticism. Barnes to me is more like a bigger Draymond/rich mans Rondae Hollis Jefferson to me. Not very sold on Moody, he‚Äôs probably more like Dorian Finney-Smith. Sengun to me is more like a better passing Kanter or Boban, skilled and big post scorer but lacking in other areas very important to the NBA game. Maybe ceiling Al Jefferson. Davion is most similar to Donovan in play style. Kispert maybe more similar to Buddy Hield but Joe Harris not bad overall as a comp. Bouknight and Ellis is fine. Giddey is more of a budget Kyle Anderson"

He‚Äôs like a Kyle Anderson clone but has no basketball skill
Shit hoping he becomes our VanFleet or Kyle Anderson next year. His size shows potential
Kyle Anderson has a really unique game more suited for a local YMCA than the NBA. Boris Diaw was similar too where they move so slow that people get confused on how to react
"Come on man.  Grayson Allen or Kyle Anderson isn‚Äôt better than Wiggins and Dray. Dray was first team all defense this year, and Wiggins was great. That is an absurd take."
"The 2016-17 Grizz was gone after the 2018-19 season. So that took 2 years, about. 2017 added Villain Brooks. 2018 added JJJ and Kyle Anderson. 2019 saw the trades of Marc and Mike and the new FO and coach, and the youth movement."
Kyle Anderson=Cade Cunningham
looks like prime kyle anderson
kyle Anderson
"No, I know, never meant to say Lillard mails it in, just that Pop (and this is pushing that same style to Hammond) doesnt like mistakes on defense and Lillard (and for that matter McCollum) have never been considered stalwarts in that department.   Tony Parker was yelled quite a few times for this and for other mistakes on the court, even when he was the main guy. Same with TD and Manu at their peaks. Kawhi got some earlashings as well, and Danny Green, Kyle Anderson, George Hill, and many more have been victimized by Pop.   This is assuming Hammond would follow a similar style, which may very well be not the case."
"Ja was overrated but it‚Äôs not his fault, it was the fault of some casual fans. They didn‚Äôt really watch games and overrated him like a mf. One of the reasons why is bc Memphis is full of underrated players that don‚Äôt have that much recognition. Because of that, ppl think ja has no help and is absolutely hard carrying them. Before the warriors had the hot stretch near the end of the season, some casual fans were saying that ja was better than Curry bc he was carrying them to a better record with a worse supporting cast than Curry. For those who watch games tho, we know how deep Memphis is. JV is an elite center, Kyle Anderson was having a career year, Dillon Brooks was proving to be a scary scorer along with bringing intense defense, etc. it‚Äôs a very solid team, unlike what casual fans think. Another reason that he was getting overrated was bc of the casual fans who only watched his highlights. Just based off his highlights, ja looks like a top 5 point guard and some genuinely believed so bc of it. However, for those who watched games, they‚Äôd know how inconsistent he was. He‚Äôd have stretches of insane scoring and then insanely cold stretches. Because of that he isn‚Äôt a top 5 point guard or anything close to it. So yes, I do believe ja was overrated and I actually really like ja."
"Spurs also do a good job of keeping quiet, keeping stuff in house.  They're like a pioneer in that category.  Plenty of players over the years have been lowkey unhappy: Aldridge had issues, Pau Gasol, Kyle Anderson, DeMarre Carroll.  It just doesn't get broadcasted."
Kyle Anderson.
Gallo drives are Kyle Anderson level of speed.
"Luka is literally an extreme anomaly.   Watch how the grizzlies role players stepped up in that warriors game and you have your answer on how ja made the playoffs. Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Valubcunas stepped up. Even Bane and Grayson Allen were great for them. Ja didn‚Äôt do anything Zion didn‚Äôt do last year. It‚Äôs just the team succeeded because they had winning players.   Trae had that exact same label as an empty stats player that can‚Äôt lead to winning in his first and second year. Even in his third year, the FO spent big bucks on Gallo, Bogi, Rondo, Dunn and even then we‚Äôre doing pretty bad until Nate McMillan came. It‚Äôs like nba fans have the memory of goldfish, they keep making these same takes, getting proved wrong and passing them on to the next player"
Cade = Kyle Anderson with an extra calf muscle.
"You're getting shit, but Luka's game is super boring to watch. He's incredibly effective and obviously a generational talent, but he's slow, unathletic, spams a few moves, and complains. He plays somewhere between Harden and Kyle Anderson."
"They may not be in the league tbh. I don‚Äôt know if klay would be able to get his shot off enough or defend well enough if he were 4 inches shorter.  Embiid I‚Äôm convinced would still be in the league at 6‚Äô8‚Äù as a 3 and D wing. Jokic is harder to see, but maybe he‚Äôd be like Kyle Anderson. Keep in mind both guys would be a lot quicker if they were smaller. The bigger you are, the harder it is to change directions quickly.  Anyways, everybody in the nba is a massive human being by people standards. Being 6‚Äô6‚Äù+ is a huge part of why klay/luka are as good as they are.  I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre acting as if height is any different than any other variable that goes into making an nba player successful."
The slowest drive to the basket I've ever seen.. and I've watched Kyle Anderson.
lol jrue just busted out the kyle anderson slo-mo fastbreak special
A rich man's Kyle Anderson? Now that I have to see.
Kyle Anderson probably. His floor is a 3&amp;D playmaking wing. But i think he easily surpasses that
Kyle Anderson
"Except he didn't do nothing, he walked across the court and got right in Boogies face and then did the ""hold me back"" after boogie had walked away and the refs didn't do anything, as detailed above. I still don't understand how boogie is soft for pushing a guy who got in his face after a loss to try and... draw a technical foul? With 0.1 on the clock?  Yeah that makes sense.  Remember when Gobert got ejected and then got in the face of Kyle Anderson?  kyle pushed him, Rudy flopped like a fish, and everyone deservedly made fun of him. How is this not the same thing and why is it badass when booker does it, that's the part I don't get."
"I didn't fault the Suns for taking DA or the Hawks for taking Trae at all. Luka was my #1 on my own personal board but I thought he was far from a surefire superstar, I just liked him the most because I thought he had the lowest ceiling (a wing with touch and high BBIQ will always have a place in the league. Like at worst he'd be like fuckin... Kyle Anderson or something). DA was a great fit with great potential and I thought Trae was the classic high-risk / high-reward home run shot.  Turns out it kinda worked out for all these teams lol"
"Deanthony Melton, Kyle Anderson, and two firsts"
"Can Kyle Anderson finally shoot? I remember being obsessed with him in his UCLA days, telling everyone I could that this guy is an all star the moment he develops a reliable jumper. LOL. Not my best take."
White outplayed Fox in direct competition at preparation scrimmages.  Fox is a great #1 gunner for an inferior quality team.  Not what was needed.  Needed smart decision making (when to pass vs. shoot vs. dribble) and defense.  Malcolm Brogdon type glue guys.  Or Kyle Anderson with his newfound 3-point stroke.
"I'm not specifically talking about being able to hit threes or even pulling a jumpshot out of thin air.   I'm talking about things such as refining pre-existing mechanics, adding different shots to their game, increasing efficiency and teaching players to get better looks + smarter shots.  Chip can turn a good shooter into a great shooter off small things. He can also get a servicable jumpshot out of someone who doesn't even have one.  &gt;Steve Kerr  [Steve Kerr and Chip have known and worked with each other for ages.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-05-17-9705170060-story.html) Kerr even tried to poach Chip from the Spurs for the Warriors a while back.  &gt;Marco Belinelli  Marco broke out as soon as he joined the Spurs. His fg% and efficiency went up a lot.   &gt;Kyle Anderson didn't start taking more shots from outside until he'd been off the spurs for over 2 years.  Still improved. He had zero jumpshot and wasn't good at free throws at all when we drafted him.  &gt;Chip literally said he didn't do anything with Bryn because his form was already so good.  Yes. He got a lot better at creating his own shot and adding to his arsenal though since he could only really catch and shoot when we drafted him."
Half of those are bad examples. Steve Kerr and Marco Belinelli were good shooters before they played for the spurs. Kyle Anderson didn't start taking more shots from outside until he'd been off the spurs for over 2 years. Chip literally said he didn't do anything with Bryn because his form was already so good.
warriors need to worry about beating kyle anderson first
"uhh, Steve Kerr? Tony Parker? Richard Jefferson? Gary Neal? Danny Green? Marco Belinelli? Kyle Anderson? Bryn Forbes?  Dejounte is getting a lot better too.  Chip has drastically helped develop and improved the shooting of all these guys. and those were just off the top of my head."
"Hopefully we can get a back-up PG or a big wing for him.  My dream would be Kyle Anderson, but no idea if Memphis is looking for a back-up C. Would easily give a FRP for him."
I‚Äôd prefer a 2 on 1 fast break with Shawn Bradley and Kyle Anderson over anything Simmons related
"I live for Kyle Anderson ""fast"" breaks."
"I fucking love Kyle Anderson now. Looking forward to more Grizzlies playoff games, that's for sure."
Too face paced for me. They need some Kyle Anderson
Honestly they should make an offer to us for Kyle Anderson
Lopez makes Kyle Anderson look like speedy Gonzalez.
Who plays at a slower pace Kyle Anderson or hobbled harden?
He went from a really good player to a much worse Kyle Anderson over the course of like 2-3 weeks
The good ol Kyle Anderson slow break
You‚Äôre not seriously telling me Kyle Anderson wouldn‚Äôt help the wolves. Lol.
&gt; Kyle Anderson is better than Aaron Gordon  What?
You guys should honestly be considering Kyle Anderson.
Send Kyle Anderson but they should only sell Brooks for a kings ransom.
"Bro it‚Äôs two 1sts for him for sure, Kyle Anderson on the other hand, yea maybe he gets traded for a 1st and a 2nd."
Moses Moody for Kyle Anderson ?
"Kyle Anderson is better than Aaron Gordon (and he went for two firsts).  Im not convinced this isn‚Äôt Memphis just shopping for an overpay.  Celtics, Warriors, Suns.  There‚Äôs capped out teams that could definitely offer the equivalent value of 2 firsts for him."
Hope Kyle Anderson ends up with a contender. The guy just knows how to play basketball despite his athletic limitations.
Kyle Anderson can help just as much too.
"Would love to get Kyle Anderson, I fear that contenders/mid level playoff teams will outbid us tho."
How could you say this?   Morant &gt; Graham   Melton &lt; NAW  Brooks &lt;&lt;&lt; Ingram  JJJ &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Zion   Adams &lt;&lt;&lt; JV  Tyus Jones &lt; Kira  Bane &lt; Sato  Kyle Anderson = Naji  Ziaire &lt; Trey Murphy   Clarke &lt; Billy  Tillman = Jax  Culver &lt; Daulton Hommes
Kyle Anderson first picture‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs see who the Grizzlies player is‚Ä¶
"Conversely to what you‚Äôre asking, Kyle Anderson is so good at being unflashy that he‚Äôs turned it into an art form and people give him love for it"
"You're using cherrypicked stats of a loaded OKC team vs a severely outmatched SA squad.   KD played on a team where Dion Waiters, Steven Adams, and Enes Kanter were outscoring Tim Duncan, Tony Parker &amp; Manu Ginobili.  Comprehend?  That's the reality.   TD+Manu were averaging 6ppg each in 20mpg, TP 10ppg, Waiters 8ppg, Adams 11ppg, Kanter 8.7ppg  2nd year players like Kyle Anderson in his 1st playoffs was tasked with guarding Durant.     The #1 reason OKC even won was because their role players outplayed San Antonio's, they KILLED the Spurs on the offensive boards, Adams-Kanter erased any bricks thrown up by Durant or WB.  That's the problem with not watching games &amp; taking them totally out of context.   Again this series went 6 games because Kawhi managed to slow down KD &amp; WB whilst being guarded by Roberson."
"Took him months to return to his old self dummy.  Talk about cherry picking.  BTW Kawhi was playing with tendinitis in his knee after beating the Bucks, which btw KD couldn't beat rofl.   Raptors injuries don't count I guess.   2016 Kawhi was guarding Westbrook dummy that's why he shot 37%.  He had to split duties with Kyle Anderson and DG on KD.  Too dumb to realize it's not normal to be playing next to an MVP candidate lol.    The big 3 were semi-retired by 2016, Duncan was being killed by Adams-Kanter, Ginobili had to be benched, and TP was a shell of his old self.   Kawhi still managed to push a loaded OKC team with injured Aldridge as his best player lol.  KD needed an MVP."

"Kawhi was usually dueling with Westbrook most of the time, KD would get shut down but as soon as WB started heating up it was his turn and it went back &amp; forth.    Spurs were stretched so thin they had to put a rookie Kyle Anderson on KD in the playoffs, that's when KD would get hot &amp; then start cooking players including Kawhi, then he was on fire &amp; it was too late."
"Everyone in this thread is saying Kings have a worse roster but Hield, Bogdanovic, Barnes would have all started for Memphis. Holmes is a perfectly good center. Ja is a leader and creates wins. Maybe Fox would drag his team to the play in with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson and JV, we'll never know but we know Ja did."
I highly doubt Rondo and Kyle Anderson are worth the trouble for the 6ers lol
Maybe the Grizzlies could get involved since they have too many players rn. Something like Rondo + Kyle Anderson and then they get a bunch of picks back
"Pop is a kind person at heart and always tends to speak highly of people, unless they‚Äôre scumbags.  But I doubt it would ever work between him and Simmons. I remember Pop going nuts over Kyle Anderson passing up open corner threes. Imagine his reaction to someone avoiding a dunk because he is scared of shooting free-throws?  Pop has always valued and encouraged guys to try and play to their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, but there is one type of player that never lasted on his rosters, the ones that didn‚Äôt assert themselves."
"Kyle Anderson, he plays in slow motion"
Slo Mo for Kyle Anderson is great.  Also his signature move the ‚Äúslow break‚Äù is second only to Giannis‚Äô Gyro Step
"I wish Portland would've swung bigger, man. I'd love to see Kyle Anderson and Danilo Gallinari, or either one, with Dame in Portland."
Kyle Anderson
Raptors dont need kyle anderson but i would love to have him
You guys have Thad Young and Kyle Anderson at home though.
"Damn, better trade Kyle Anderson asap if you want slomo to get to his new team by the start of the season."
"Can I interest you in Rajon Rondo, Kyle Anderson and Tyus Jones?"
&gt; Somebody should trade for Thad Young who was the leagues best player to be eligible for 6MOTY last yr. Kyle Anderson would also be a good get Memphis aint serious about looking to win.  Olshey plz.  Either would be an amazing fit for the Blazers.
Did anyone else read this like Kyle Anderson was the source? Commas are hard.
Call you Kyle Anderson
"Yea, only way this gets used soon is for someone to take some minutes at the 4. Ala Kyle Anderson"
I'm hoping more for Kyle Anderson or Thad Young rather than Tobias because of the salary matching reasons.  Also Tobi is a good defender but not really someone I see ironing out or frontcourt D. He'd have a heavy burden on that end imo.
"Wasn‚Äôt Kyle Anderson essentially off the table for the Grizz in trade up scenarios a couple of weeks ago?  At least, to move up to 7 he wasn‚Äôt available so i doubt the Grizz are moving him."
Cam Reddish? The untouchable trade asset whom they couldnt even get Indiana to swap 13 for 20 with?  Somebody should trade for Thad Young who was the leagues best player to be eligible for 6MOTY last yr. Kyle Anderson would also be a good get Memphis aint serious about looking to win. TJ Warren good buy low if he can be had for a reasonable price.
[And yet it might not even be the most embarrassing moment of his career](https://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/23/14068952/wesley-johnson-kyle-anderson-clippers-spurs-bloopers)
JJJ? Brooks? Kyle Anderson? Are all better than bev and Adams
"I would argue that Kyle Anderson is better than Pat Bev. Yves Pons is on an exhibit 10 deal. Sean McDermott is currently on a two-way deal. It would be unreasonable to consider either of those players to be ""on their roster"". Xavier Tillman is mostly a Center, so he's not really a guard/forward.   I'll agree that Pat Bev is better currently than Sam Merrill, John Konchar, and Ziaire Williams, so he's better than 3/10 of the G/Fs currently on the Grizzlies roster. But now we're talking about dudes that are out of the rotation, and if they aren't playing anyway, I'd rather have youth sitting on the bench than a 33 year old dude."
Slo-Mo as in Kyle Anderson? Dude is 6‚Äô9 and officially listed as F/G. Get legit 6‚Äô4 PF Jae‚ÄôSean Tate in there
Are we talkin about the same Slow-mo? Pretty sure Kyle Anderson is 6‚Äô9 bruv
"Looking at their roster on NBA.com Pat Bev is better than Kyle Anderson, John Kochar, Sean McDermott, Sam Merrill, Yves Pons, Xavier Tillman, and Ziare Williams. He‚Äôs a better role player than 7 out of 11 guards/forwards. So yes, it simply is true"
Never try to race Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson will beat him because he'll cut in front of him.
&gt;I know every guy in the NBA can beat me in a 3/4 court sprint.  Giving Brook Lopez and Kyle Anderson a bit too much credit here.
Kyle Anderson couldn‚Äôt.
Kyle Anderson
He didnt even seem that fast  Gave me kyle anderson vibes

Kyle Anderson. He never stops moving. Just not at your speed.
"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).  This team should be good enough to win a title. I really like Giannis and Jokic as a pairing as well.Jokic as a pairing as well."
He‚Äôs not Giannis but your are being absolutely disrespectful comparing him to Kyle Anderson lol
Kyle Anderson 2.0
"Yeah Marc gasol was amazing that year but he was 4-5 years older!   Sengun doesn't have the height and wingspan of Gasol, but I truly believe that he has a preternatural feel for the game that he will be able to apply on defense as his career progresses and he develops further.   Hollinger mentioned gasol in his take on Sengun - saying smart euro bigs usually figure it out on D.  He looks faster than I expected in summer league so far, and I think he will be able to slide his feet reasonably well on the perimeter. He is strong and good using his body - the issue is more with speedy guards than it is with the bruising forwards.  I also believe in the shooting long term and think he will get to Kyle Anderson levels (like 38% on low-medium volume, all spot-up or standstill)."
Kyle Anderson
"Kyle Anderson. His nickname is ""Slo-Mo."" And he has a sometimes sickeningly slow but smooth Eurostep."
"Are we talking about pace of play or agility? There are a lot of guys that play slow but aren‚Äôt necessarily slow athletes.   Kyle Anderson is one of those guys that‚Äôs just flat out slow. But, guys like D‚ÄôLo or Khris Middleton just play at a slower pace."
Easy. Kyle anderson
"Is Kevin Love a center or still a power forward? After Slo-Mo (Kyle Anderson), Love isn't exactly putting anyone on skates."
The only correct answer to this question is Kyle Anderson
Kyle ‚ÄúSlo-mo‚Äù Anderson
Kyle Anderson. His nickname is slo-mo
"Yeah, and the Spurs who played more than 10 minutes in that game were LaMarcus Aldridge, Jonathon Simmons, Danny Green, Pau Gasol, Patty Mills, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, and Manu Ginobili. Ginobili was 39, Gasol was 37, and Murray was 20. That may be slightly better than what Houston had, but not by enough that they should have lost by almost 40 points."
Bledsoe and Kyle Anderson
I've been saying he looks like a rich man's Kyle Anderson
"What happens if Cade just turns out to be a smaller, richer man's Kyle Anderson? Remember, Anderson was the #3 prospect in his HS class once upon a time too. Granted, this type of player is more suited to how basketball is played in 2021 (and Anderson himself is now coming off his best NBA season) than 8-9 years ago, but still, the similarities are there."
"A lot of Grizzlies pundits would disagree with you there. (Not me, I thought he was second behind Ja.)  JV was significantly better than Kyle Anderson throughout the regular season."
"JV is the exact opposite of a stable force. Hes a player that can dominate certain matchups while being nearly unplayable in others. He had a lot of fanboys among Grizz fans, but we haven't all felt that way.  Kyle Anderson is definitely the superior player."
"You're gonna pretend like it wasn't said last year either? Ja was injured for a good part and was struggling for a bit. In the playoffs, Ja definitely showed out, and it was a sign of things to come. But JV was the stable force behind the Grizzlies success, and I've seen plenty of Memphis fans say the similar (though some even felt Kyle Anderson at times was the best player)  EDIT: and here's a thread if you choose to not believe me  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndwfz0/whos\_the\_best\_player\_on\_the\_grizzlies\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndwfz0/whos_the_best_player_on_the_grizzlies_when/)"
In no universe was JV ever the Grizzlies best player last year except for the times when Morant wasn't playing.  Even still Kyle Anderson was better.
He's a lot like Kyle Anderson but with way more burst.  Even down to the super slow jumper and passes that seemingly someone his frame shouldn't make.
"How useful are advanced metrics, especially defensive ones? According to advanced defensive metrics Kyle Anderson is a much better defensive player than Dillon Brooks. In fact, according to BPM and VORP, Kyle Anderson is the best player on the grizzlies. None of that makes sense to me."
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)). They posted their own Three All-Defensive Teams ausing the G/G/F/F/C format and . I would like to bring them here!

Kyle Anderson
kyle anderson
Kyle Anderson has done that a few times I think
Kyle Anderson   Malcolm Brogdon  DeJounte Murray   Jalen Brunson  TJ McConnell
"You're getting a lot of troll responses, but the Olympic 3x3 was really fun to watch. It's difficult because of the qualification requirements, but if USA Basketball wanted to take the men's 3x3 as seriously as they take the women's 3x3 (and I think they should), then it's definitely possible. Ideally, you'd have one taller point guard (Dejounte is a good pick), and then 2 big wings who are good one-on-one defenders (Harrison Barnes, Mikal Bridges, and Kyle Anderson come to mind), and one mobile big as a roll man who can also guard on the perimeter on switches (John Collins definitely works here, as does someone like Mason Plumlee or Aaron Gordon)."
Kyle Anderson should be getting the nod anyday now.
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
"Maybe Grizzlies cause Bledsoe isn't gonna play for us this season. Also got 3 first rounders next year and expiring rotation pieces in Tyus Jones, Kyle Anderson, and Grayson Allen."
"No way of answering this until we see the Thompson trade actually go through.  Right now we're getting Bruno and Dunn back in the deal but then the deal got held up and there were rumours more was at play (with Dunn and Bruno maybe not coming to Boston).  **IF** that's true then:  1. We could be getting a player back via a multi-team trade. We could use Thompson going to Atlanta as a salary matcher to bring a player in from a  3rd team.   *eg. Kuzma is currently with Washington but they have Deni and Rui and when they tried to offload him to Brooklyn, the Nets said no. We could maybe get him cheap. We've also been interested in Kyle Anderson from Memphis for a while.*  2. We could be offloading Thompson to clear up more of our MLE. We can only use ~7m of our TPE right now but if we're able to trade Thompson without taking Dunn/Bruno back we'd have a little more breathing room that would allow us to maybe sign a remaining FA.   *eg. We're apparently one of the teams interested in signing Danny Green. We'd probably need the full MLE to make a competitive offer though.*   But then again maybe nothing happens and the Thompson/Dunn/Bruno trade goes through unchanged and we can only sign a vet min."
I think Jonas was better than Kyle Anderson this year. Sure he‚Äôs a post-up guy but that‚Äôs a massive improvement over Steven Adams who I genuinely believe was scared to shoot layups this year.   The Vucevic move was considered an overpay because they gave Orlando a pretty decent pick and a pick that was an uncertainly as we don‚Äôt know if the bulls were/are really gonna be good in 2023. The lakers should be good next year barring major disaster though in my opinion which makes giving up their pick passable for me
Jonas was best offensive guy with morant out but I think many grizzlies fans would argue Kyle Anderson was the most consistent.  Someone free to correct me since I didn‚Äôt watch many of their games but guessing you haven‚Äôt either.  I do know his game is definitely not versatile on either end of the court however.  He‚Äôs a post up guy mainly and isn‚Äôt too mobile defending them perimeter.  An expiring can easily leave after a year too.  A pick swap and a 1st rder even a projected late one is not insignificant or you‚Äôre saying harden fetched basically nothing for houston.  Vucevic an all star lvl big with multiple years left cost ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2 picks and that was considered an overpay by many analysts.
"2016 Spurs  PG: Tony Parker / Andre Miller / Patty Mills SG: Manu Ginobili / Kevin Martin / Danny Green SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kyle Anderson / Rasual Butler PF: LaMarcus Aldridge / David West / Boris Diaw C: Tim Duncan / Boban Marjanovic / Matt Bonner  That‚Äôs one multi-MVP all-timer (Duncan)  A multi-DPOY and FMVP who can score 27 ppg and is a top-3 player in the playoffs (Kawhi)  Three multi All-NBA players (Ginobili, Parker, LMA)  One two-time all-star (West)  Three borderline all-stars (Andre Miller, Kevin Martin and Boris Diaw all had seasons where they were close to that level)  Two exceptional 3-and-D wings (Anderson and Danny Green)  For my money, this legitimately might be the best one ever. A starting lineup of All-NBA players plus that depth off the bench is just staggering. The weakest position is center but Duncan played nearly 40 MPG back then and LMA and West would be capable of filling in those minutes as well."
Its obviously Kyle Anderson.
"I‚Äôd suggest Kyle Anderson, but I want the C‚Äôs to get him"
Smart for Kyle Anderson is whats rumored right?
"His recognition and awareness stood out to me. Giddey reads the game and creates shooting opportunities out of nothing. For Adelaide, Josh was very good at switching the ball to the weak-side corner whenever he saw the defender at the rim squeezing the strong-side of the floor.   I think the concerns about his passes getting picked off are overblown. He has the height to pass over the top of the defence and that overhead pass whips the ball to his teammate before the defence can respond. His passing windows will get smaller in the half-court in the NBA but he should still be very strong in transition.   LaMelo's not the right comp neither is Lonzo or Kyle Anderson. There are no real comparisons that make sense for Giddey"
Big strong body and handles that can be built upon. He may not be backup point material but I can see him being a Kyle Anderson or Derrick White type if Nate gives him a chance.
"**Block A:** Start Harden, Bench Luka, Cut Dame  This is a toss-up and ultimately a win-win situation no matter what.    **Block B:** Start Kyle Anderson, Bench Matisse Thybulle, Cut Robert Covington  I think Anderson is easier to fit into any starting lineup due to his range of skills. Matisse's lack of offense/spacing makes it tough + he's been good off the bench. RoCo is too hot/cold.     **Block C**: Start Cade, Bench Mobley, Cut Jalen Green  Ignoring potential, right now Cade is the most pro-ready. And Mobley's mix of length, athleticism, playmaking, touch, and defense should allow him to adapt quicker than Green."
"A: Start Harden, Bench Luka, Cut Dame  B: Start Kyle Anderson, Bench Thybulle, Cut RoCo  C: Start Cade, Bench Jalen Green, Cut Mobley"
"I honestly think we've earned a solid player development rep. If I were a prospect or someone on the precipice of being out of the NBA, I'd definitely see if the Spurs were interested in signing me for cheap just to develop and try to carve out a role.  Think of all the dudes who got great second contracts after playing for SA.  Beno Udrih - drafted 28th overall, played decent minutes as a rookie as the backup PG for a title winning team in 05. We trade him to Minne in his final year of his rookie deal to cut costs, he ends up as a FA and signs with SAC, who then extend him on a 5 year 32mil deal.  Ian Mahinmi - he barely plays with us, but we keep him on the roster for 3 years. He signs a minimum deal with DAL, then winds up being part of a S&amp;T to Indiana on a 4/16mil deal. Eventually makes bank with a 4/64mil deal with the Wizards in the dreaded 2016 off-season.  George Hill - we took a chance on him when other teams were scared off due to IUPUI being deemed too small of a school. He develops, we trade him again in the final year of his deal and signs multiple high $ contracts over a very long career.  Gary Neal - a guy we brought in from overseas, who I think was 26 at the time, signed a 3 year contract for relative peanuts with team outs after the first season. His total earnings from SA were only ~2mil over 3 seasons, but then he signed a 2 year 6.5mil deal with MIL, then another 1 year deal for the vet min with the Wizards, which because he had been an NBA vet for 5 years at that point was a little over 2mil  DeJuan Blair - made 4mil on his rookie deal over 4 years with SA, then made another 4.5mil while bouncing around the league another 3 years.  Kyle Anderson - develop him into a great roleplayer, he signs a solid deal with Memphis that he's actually out-performed and is in line for a bigger pay day on his next deal.  Johnathon Simmons - probably the best example of this trend. He literally walked-on to try out for the (at the time) Austin Toros. The FO sees something in him and signs him to a 2 year deal with most of the money unguaranteed. He makes the most of his opportunities in 16 and 17, playing great defense on Harden in the playoffs and doing enough on offense to take advantage of Harden's defense. Signs a 3/24 with Orlando.  This isn't even counting guys like Danny Green and Patty Mills, who were claimed off the waiver wire and have ended up earning a ton while becoming fantastic players."
"Dejounte, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson all look pretty good considering where they were drafted. Kyle Anderson was good while a Spur, not sure where you're getting the idea that he only blossomed in Memphis. These are also guys being drafted at the end of the 1st round, where expected value is very low but they manage to get contributors more often than other teams.   Going back further you have Parker, Ginobili, Cory Joseph, George Hill, Tiago Splitter. The highest pick of any of those guys was like 26."
"What's the basis for even giving him a ceiling. This is literally just saying some random shit.   Like, you could call his ceiling Luka if you wanted, it's not literally impossible. What do I actually think he'll be? Probably a better version of Kyle Anderson."
Kyle Anderson with better playmaking
Giddey is Kyle Anderson with less offense and defense lol
"If win shares and Vorp and shit actually accurately reflected reality, Gobert would be the 2nd best player in the world, Cp3, Capela, and Mikal would be top 15.  /#16 in WS last year was Jonas Valanciunas   /#17 was Luka  /#18 was Enes Kanter  /#21 was Montrezl  /#28 Zubac  /#42 Poeltl, 43 Kyle Anderson, 44 LeBron.   Lol"
Kyle Anderson is actually the fastest guy in the league. He moves so fast it looks like he is in slow motion to the human eye
Dude they didn‚Äôt make the playoffs with AD The jruth (before he got the respect he deserved dude been balling since phili) Eric Gordon Ryan Anderson and Tyreke evans. They aren‚Äôt going to be a contender as stacked as the west is I doubt they‚Äôll even be a playoff team they lost like half their games last year alone in like the final 5 minutes because of general inexperience and lack of vets. They certainly aren‚Äôt a destination and hanged their future in almost 40 year old Kyle Lowry. They need a complete wipe of roster rebranding and ownership/management
"I feel like the guys that are seen as kind of boring for how good they are are probably the best to watch. Like TJ McConnell, Chris Paul, Kyle Anderson, or Draymond Green. Guys that consistently make the right decisions."
Marc Gasol   Mike Conley   Rudy Gay   Ja Morant   JJJ  Dillon Brooks   Desmond Bane   Kyle Anderson   Deanthony Melton   Brandon Clarke   Xavier Tillman   Ziaire Williams
"Look how late those Spurs picks were.  They weren't drafting early!  As to Kevon Looney... To judge players' value, lets look at what they get paid.  In his first real contract (the contract after rookie contract), Looney got paid about 4.5 million/yr.  But Kyle Anderson got 9.5mil/yr.  Dejuante Murray got 16 mil/yr.   And Derrick White got over 18mil/yr.  Those guys might as well be in a different league than Lonney.  They're starters.  Looney is bench.  As to the missed drafts-- my original argument was that Warriors don't deserve a rep for being **good** at drafting/developing players (i.e. mentioned in same sentence Spurs or Celtics).  Because they simply haven't done it since 2012.  Trading away picks is a part of that.  There are simply no real success stories to point at and say ""Hey, these guys are good""."
"PG Jrue, SG Shai, SF Kawhi, PF Giannis, C Sabonis  Bench: McConnell, Kyle Anderson, Howard, Duncan, Turner, Smart, Ingles"
"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."
"Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Malcolm Brogdon and Grayson Allen"
"If Kyle Anderson can make it in this league, I don't see why someone shouldn't give this guy a shot."
"For the average basketball player look at dudes like Luka, Joe Ingles, and Kyle Anderson. They‚Äôre all kind of slow, but crafty and strong"
i very much do not want the celtics to get kyle anderson
"Yeah he'd be ideal.   It's the same reason we kept getting linked to Kyle Anderson, Larry Nance Jr. and to an extent Harrison Barnes.   A 2-way wing with some size and shooting is exactly what we're after.   Grant would be the best of the bunch though."
Kyle ‚ÄúSlow mo‚Äù Anderson. Players can learn from his positioning and deceleration
"Kyle Anderson, DeAnthony Melton, and Tyus Jones for Ben Simmons straight up works financially, according to ESPN Trade Machine, and reduces each team's projected wins by just 1 apiece."
"Memphis trade Kyle Anderson, DeAnthony Melton, and Tyus Jones for Ben Simmons straight up.   Works financially according to ESPN Trade Machine, and reduces each team's projected wins by just 1 apiece."
Just watch him in summer league. Man is slower than Kyle Anderson
Have you ever seen Kyle Anderson try to run
"Kyle Anderson‚Ä¶  Jokes aside, probably the part time basketball players back in the 40‚Äôs - 50‚Äôs"
Kyle Anderson comes to mind
Kyle anderson
"KAT, Edwards, DLo, Beasley and McDaniels has the makings of a pretty darn good starting lineup, especially if Edwards really did grow to 6‚Äô6‚Äù and McDaniels puts on weight. Ant is gonna have a heck of a lot of space to drive with that many shooters around him.   My biggest worry with the Timberwolves is their depth. Naz Reid and Patrick Beverly are pretty decent bench guys, but they really need a second creator off the bench. It would be huge if the Wolves could trade for a guy like Kyle Anderson, who can create offense and fill in multiple positions in the starting lineup.   The Timberwolves lack of depth is a big reason why injuries have hit them so hard."
"OG Anouby, cole Anthony, Carmelo Anthony, giannis antetkoumpo, Kyle Anderson."
PG - Ja   SG - Dillon Brooks  SF - Kyle Anderson  PF - JJJ  C - Steven Adams   - Bench mob:  PG: Melton  SG: Bane  SF: Ziaire  PF: Santi? idk  C: Tillman
"Cade has had some nasty posters, windmills and through the leg dunks in his career. Dude euro-stepped into a poster in the FIBA U19 finals.   His game isn‚Äôt predicated on athleticism, he‚Äôs more methodical; controlling the pace and playing at his own speed. This narrative that he‚Äôs Kyle Anderson or as athletic as Middleton is pretty tired though. Guy went #1 for a reason"
I wonder if Memphis will join the fray with a Brooks/Kyle Anderson package.
No idea who this guy is. But Toronto has the recent history of developing their players. So you have that going for you.  I was a huge Kyle Anderson fan. Another dude where his IQ and instincts were by far the best assests of his game. When San Antonio drafted him I felt vindicated
"Lonzo Ball  Norman Powell   LeBron James  Kyle Anderson   Kelly Olynyk   Bench: Satoransky, Nance Jr, Garrison Matthews   I think they could beat a lot of championship teams but idk about the Warriors. If you add Embiid though, different story."
"To me, He's a faster version of Kyle Anderson with a better shot. Will be rooting for him"
I am convinced that the only ones capable of slowing down Trae are Kevon Looney and Kyle Anderson.
Kyle Anderson
If Kyle Anderson showed up at the Y I legitimately wouldn‚Äôt pick him first
Kyle Anderson for sure. Think of how much skill you need to have to play in the NBA with the athletic profile of a guy at the YMCA rocking air monarchs
"Not a chance, hes gonna be good but in terms of ""Safety"" there is a chance where hes a Kyle Anderson roleplayer at best."
Kyle Anderson
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
"Blazers aren‚Äôt going to trade for a 24 year old with Dame being almost 32 wanting to win now. They‚Äôre going to look for something that has a faster turnout (like a Beal or Towns)  Why would Sixers trade for Ingram? They have Tobias Harris who is practically the same player as Ingram, the two would just be butting heads on offense and be redundant. Sixers want and need a point guard, preferably a scoring one, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pursuing Dame. They‚Äôre not going after a wing. They‚Äôll get DLo out of Minnesota before they go for Ingram.  Warriors maybe, but I can see them being in a similar situation as Portland and going after Siakam since he‚Äôs more of a win-now wing that can fit with Steph, Klay and Draymond. One can argue that it would probably be the same situation as they have with Wiggins if they got Ingram.  Sacramento could offer a Buddy Hield + Harrison Barnes type package but i don‚Äôt think that is better than a Dillion Brooks and Kyle Anderson package. Dillion Brooks as a player &gt; Buddy + Kyle Anderson at this point is a better player than Barnes is. Also, Anderson and Brooks‚Äôs contracts are a lot more team friendly and they‚Äôre both younger."
Dillon Brooks + Kyle Anderson + possibly more package.
I rlly want Kyle Anderson with the TPE somehow. Juancho isn‚Äôt ideal but it‚Äôs bound to happen based on Cubans track record.
"Both teams were not equal, the Spurs big 3 were on the verge of retirement &amp; were being outscored by Waiters, Adams &amp; Kanter who were all in their young 20s, Adams being just 22 and dominating Duncan.  OKC was a horrific match-up in general because their athleticism.   2nd year Kyle Anderson also got the call to defend KD in his 1st ever playoffs when Kawhi rested.      That series was won primarily on the offensive boards, SA had no answer for Kanter-Adams-WB.    Still Kawhi managed to steal 2 against a loaded OKC team, crazy."
"I have no idea what Adams/Waiters/Kanter vs Duncan/Manu/Parker has to do with KD vs Kawhi  wut? they were putting Danny Green and Kawhi on KD. tell me how many of KD""s points were scored on Kyle Anderson"
"Kawhi had KD on lock at several points in the series, the issue was he had to guard WB, while Kyle Anderson got the call on KD whenever Kawhi got benched."
"No he hasn't lol, Adams, Waiters &amp; Kanter were outscoring Duncan, Manu &amp; Parker in the playoffs.  The main reason they even won that series was because the offensive rebounding by WB-Adams-Kanter.    Kawhi was on a severely &amp; I mean severely overmatched team where they were putting Kyle Anderson in his 1st playoffs on Kevin Durant."
Chicago should go after Kyle Anderson
"Kyle Anderson, let him lull you to sleep with his emphatic playstyle"
"Kyle ""Slow Mo"" Anderson ?"
Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson really is just too slow for the other players to guard him
Kevin Slim reaper Durant. Kyle slomo Anderson. The Rifle.
Why would the Grizzlies do that? Lol. Dillion Brooks is a stud and Kyle Anderson is a super smart jack of all trades type player. The Cavs don‚Äôt really have anything they would be willing to give up for either of those players that would help the Grizzlies/entice them enough to let either of them go in a trade.
Donte Divicenzo for Kyle Anderson straight up. Sounds fair.
"Curry was +4 and scored 4 more points on 1 less shot. Morant was -1.  Curry was doing this while getting trapped because he was playing alongside Wiggins (Averaged 19 pts), Green (Averaged 7 pts), Looney (Averaged 4 pts) and Kent Bazemore (Averaged 7 pts). Meanwhile, Warriors had to guard Dillon Brooks (Averaged 17 pts), Valanciunas (Averaged 17 pts), Jackson Jr. (Averaged 14 pts) and Kyle Anderson (Averaged 12 pts)."
"JV is very overrated on this sub, but I still think it's pretty big downgrade to go from him to adams  Agree with what you said on Grayson and Beverley  I think the bigger tank moves are coming. I would be shocked if we started next season with Kyle Anderson. If we don't trade him, we aren't going to have any room to run our recently acquired forwards  Maybe tanking isn't the best way to describe it, but I think it's obvious that our gm is looking more to the medium term."
"but Kyle Anderson isnt sniffing that type of return. Im down to sell that high on Dillon, I have my doubts about his ability to maintain his playoff level of play consistently."
"I would trade Kyle Anderson that because he‚Äôs not on the same timeline as our core and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre resigning him when his contract is up because we can‚Äôt pay everybody and not on the same timeline. But I wouldn‚Äôt trade Brooks for that. He is only 3 years older and has made leaps and bounds progress over the years. I have no doubt that offensively, he‚Äôs respectable now, that‚Äôs his floor, but could get more consistent. I dont trade Brooks unless another GM makes a silly offer. Or unless Kuminga or an all star is involved."
Lauri for Kyle Anderson
All the moves this off-season tell me the Grizzlies really just want to see what they have in Ja and JJJ. Brooks actually averaged the most FGA (15.4) on the team last year and JV also took more FGA (12 vs 11.4) than JJJ. Kyle Anderson (also involved in trade talks) was 5th with 9.5 FGA.
Kyle Anderson would instantly be like the 5th tallest player in the WNBA. He‚Äôs the same height as Britney Griner. It would be the NBA equivalent of Mitchell Robinson with great guard skills. This is even putting aside the obvious strength differences. He would completely dominate the WNBA on both ends and I would be shocked if he didn‚Äôt become the GOAT
No. A buddy of mine claimed that Kyle Anderson wouldn‚Äôt be special in the wnba.
serious question are you kyle anderson
The Memphis Grizzlies traded away their best player and are looking to offload Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks will not be winning 41 games. Especially since they also traded away Grayson Allen.  Everything they've done has signaled that they want to tank
" I'll list all the guys that I think are really really underrated (of course not the same level of players) :  DeAndre Hunter : A lot of people think he's just a 3&amp;D, but he's shown some mid range stuff that could translate into low all star type of shot creation already  PJ Dozier : I think he's a high end back up, good defender, good ballhandler, good positional versatility, athletic  Eric Gordon (crazy overpaid tho) : still a guy that can switch well, was very solid defensively in the playoffs every year, can shoot, spot up from deep, can shot create a bit still  Kyle Anderson : his shot is crazy slow and he's unathletic, but other than that he basically is decent or good at everything  Richaun Holmes : the Kings were good with him on the court last year, and were basically the worst defense of all time without him  Derrick White : has shown some impressive shot creation in the bubble, think he's underutilized because he shared the floor with 2 guys who can't shoot and therefore had to take a backseat when he came back from injury"
I would love to add Kyle Anderson.  The problem is all we have to trade with are like Jalen Smith and picks
"i could understand kyle anderson, but why would they wanna trade dillon brooks? isn‚Äôt he really essential to their core?"
"Buddy hield had another down year, tyrese was a rookie, Barnes was good, and Holmes was good. Jonas and Dillon Brooks were better than all those guys last year. Kyle Anderson and Grayson Allen are solid role players, and all those grizzlies players didn‚Äôt have the burden of getting to be coached by the worst coach in the entire league. So no they are not on par with each other."
"Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes is on par with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Jonas Valanciunus and Kyle Anderson"
"Wait... is this a giant troll thread by Grizz fans to pump Dillon Brooks' trade value? When did everyone start seeing Dillon Brooks as a desirable trade asset? He is below average as a 3-pt shooter and an average defender at absolute best... just about all the advanced stats out there say he's complete garbage (yes yes, I know advanced stats don't tell the whole story). But he doesn't even pass the eye test - he's a chucker with poor shot selection. I genuinely don't know if he has one above average skill besides maybe shot-creation. Kyle Anderson is better at just about everything.  What am I missing???"
Kyle Anderson always shows up for the playoffs
The Kings should go for Kyle Anderson just for the change of pace with Fox.
"We‚Äôre missing arguably our best backcourt defender in a backcourt predominant league in Dillon Brooks. And whether you think him or Kyle Anderson is the better defender, DB is def our defensive heart. Not gonna say we‚Äôre gonna magically get great on defense, but DB is def missed"
"Idk man, athleticism isn't always necessary if you're crafty enough, look at all of the Kyle Anderson fast breaks. He's only a rook, I think he'll get better at that stuff."
Why does it matter if they move slowly? If going fast is a skill going slow is too. Kyle Anderson didn‚Äôt get SlowMo nickname for nothing.
Preseason he actually looked like a great floorspacing piece but now nobody is hitting 3s for us. Plus he's supposed to be playing the 4/5 on our team and that's bad for us. He's dollar store Kyle Anderson.
"I can see that happening if they decide that him as a bench scorer doesn‚Äôt help their team as much as other things, and I think Chicago has a really good opportunity to fill out their roster more with potential trade pieces like Coby, DJJ‚Äôs contract and that Blazers pick.  Idk why but I can just see another solid role player like Kyle Anderson or Donte Divincenzo in a bulls jersey"
"Definitely the Spurs.  I have a deep appreciation for well run organizations and they originally drafted my favorite player, Kyle Anderson. Watching them aquire and develop legitimate NBA players consistently is something of beauty. Especially since their draft picks are all relatively late.  If any other team drafted Primo when he was taken, I'd laugh. But I'm afraid to not be in on the joke in a few years when Primo is killing it"
"Elleby is a solid glue guy, no star potential but he's a half IQ double the energy Kyle Anderson. A bit of fine tuning he is a nice gap filler."
"It's a timing thing too. not just how but when he steps, knowing where his defender is. Like if I go this way, my defender won't be able to challenge my shot cuz they'll run into their teammate.  it's also setting up moves and counter moves. Last time I did this and finished with a finger roll going right. I'll do the same sequence of steps and finish with the left off the glass.   Watch Kyle Anderson. If it was all quickness and suddenness, Anderson would be terrible, but   Kyle is keyed into his own rhythm and knows where everyone is on the court.  Those are all kind of different skills from strict ""footwork"" but those skills aren't separate in the first place"
Barnes with the elite Kyle Anderson quickness.
A faster more athletic Kyle Anderson is not too shabby IMO
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
Kyle Anderson that can shoot is a great player. Always hoped he would evolve into that. Still am.
"Not disagreeing with you, but Kyle Anderson does have a 3 ball nowadays. Shot 36% from 3 on nearly 4 attempts a game last season."
"Yeah, I feel like a floor would be something like a Kyle Anderson with a 3 ball."
Should've went with the Kyle Anderson approach smh smh
Dillon brooks back and Kyle Anderson not playing like gutter trash will solve the bench issue. Lakers specifically give the Grizz backup bigs problems with their size.
Even Kyle Anderson seems fast against the Lakers
Kyle Anderson
Tell me you've never watched Kyle Anderson without telling me you've never watched Kyle Anderson.
"I think I went Kyle Anderson over him lol, I wasn't sure what was going to happen with their loaded front court"
Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson is so smooth
"I don't think smooth has to do with speed really or style, to me it just means who has one speed at all times, and no sharp jerky change of direction. There is only one answer to this question Kyle ""slo-mo"" Anderson, IMO. Dude could be in a dead sprint on a fastbreak or walking back to the huddle for a timeout yet, both seem to be in the same fluid motion."
Kyle Anderson
"Kyle ""slo-mo"" Anderson"
Seriously doubt it. Either Melton or Bane will move to the bench and whichever does will be first off the bench with Kyle Anderson.
Was Kyle Anderson just high fiving imaginary teammates after those FTs?
Kyle Anderson and De'Aaron Fox
He‚Äôs like a faster Kyle Anderson
"&gt;and having Larry who is a smart defender but I struggle to see him adjusting to the pace of this NBA compared to the older pace where he could defend.  Good defense has more to do with effort than foot speed or athleticism. It helps to be fast and jump high, but Joe Ingles is a better defender than say Kyrie Irving. Kyle Anderson is a better defender than Tyler Herro. LeBron can take the faster player of the 3/4 position if it's a concern"
You forgot to add that Kyle Anderson is the slowest human on earth but nailed it otherwise.
jokic RACING down the court like Kyle Anderson
"Yeah, Grizzlies have Kyle Anderson"
"Mordant, JJJ, Kyle Anderson, Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Melton there you go"
Kyle Anderson with a signature statline of 10/7/4 with 2 steals and 0 turnovers. Perennial 8th man of the year.
Actually this might not be as bad against the Grizzlies with Kyle Anderson and JJJ at the 3 and 4.  Pretty sure Mobley can guard SloMo.
"Looks like him, plays nothing like him. His game kind of reminds me of Kyle Anderson"
If they do that maybe we could get him for Kyle Anderson and a couple 2nd rounders lol.
Losing Valanciunas definitely hurts them. Steven Adams isn't anywhere near the offensive threat JVal was. However Jaren Jackson missed most of the season and he adds another dimension to their team. I know expecting him to stay healthy is a stretch but the potential is there. Ja is still a killer and they have good role players like Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson
"You mean the guy that had a generational talent that they had built a team around quit playing, forced a trade, and tanked his trade value somehow missed a few playoffs afterward? Lets ignore that while Kawhi was nursing his injury, Pop still somehow got a terrible line-up to the playoffs that year, and then the next two years competed until the very last week of the season to fight for a playoff spot.   Seriously, look at the line-up he managed to get into the 2018 playoffs (2nd yr Dejounte Murray/washed up Tony Parker who avg 7ppg, Danny Green, washed up Gasol, Kyle Anderson, and Aldridge). Name me one other coach in the league you think could take that starting lineup to the playoffs."
Barnes looks like a more athletic Kyle Anderson  Not sure what that means
People keep putting Kyle Anderson in these hypothetical trades. I hope never
"Cade:  * Ceiling: Luka * Floor: Kyle Anderson  Green:  * Ceiling: Kobe * Floor: Jamal Crawford  Mobley:   * Ceiling: KG / Giannis with a jump shot * Floor: Larry Sanders with better offense  Barnes:  * Ceiling: Ben Simmons / Andre Iguodala / more athletic Draymond * Floor: Having some trouble with this one... He's going to be a solid defender no matter what, and he's got point forward skills. Jabari Parker who I saw mentioned in another comment isn't a terrible comparison.  Suggs:  * Ceiling: Deron Williams / not fat Baron Davis * Floor: Rodney Stuckey"
Unbiased but  Cade: Luka  Green: MJ without the defense  Mobley: AD  Barnes: Draymond Green with a jumper/handle  Suggs: Jrue Holiday   Floor  Cade: Kyle Anderson  Green: Malik Monk  Mobley: Jabari Parker with D  Barnes:   Suggs: Cory Joseph
"No we should all play elementary ball where you sprint everywhere with the ball exposed instead.  Players are always talking about learning to not play full speed all the time. That's what this is. If you get them on your back you dictate when the burst happens. Watch any PG snake a pick and roll and they'll control the defender the same way. Or literally any Kyle Anderson ""fast"" break."
"Kyle Anderson is slow but he's huge, with a giant wingspan(6th biggest standing reach in his draft class despite being a wing)."
"Zach Randolph, Kyle Anderson, Steve Nash? I don't actually know just guesses"
Who‚Äôs better Fat Ben or Kyle Anderson? Or are they the same person?
"Is Dillion Brooks, Jonas Valanciunas, and Kyle Anderson really much better than Richaun Holmes, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy Hield?"
"Jaren missed almost all of last season. If he plays well, they could be about as good or even better than last season. Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Jaren Jackson, Desmond Bane, Steven Adams, and Brandon Clarke is a decent core. Definitely not great and they could miss the playoffs pretty easily especially with the warriors presumably being better but they're a decent team."
So far you‚Äôve got three with Boris Diaw/Kyle Anderson/Draymond Green as being similar in archetype- what other two players would complete the starting five in that same mold?
Kinda like a bigger Kyle Anderson. Bit faster tho. Remember ppl said he was like 300 lbs for a bit.
"Kyle ""Lord of Time"" Anderson"
Not as explosive too  Dude is more toward Kyle Anderson on dribble drive

Kyle Anderson
I'm taking Kyle Anderson in red light green light. Even if he moves it'll be too slow for it to detect
Go to any non playoff team and try to get their best veterans.  Harrison Barnes. Dillon Brooks. Kyle Anderson. Thad Young. Derrick White. Etc. you could get a legit starter. A 6th man. And a big to fill the roster.
"Kyle Anderson in HS... played him in the state tournament. The score was 2-2 and then he proceeded to go on something like a 20-0 run just by himself. I can still hear the announcer saying his name after every bucket.   ""KYLEEEE ANDDDDERSONNNNNN"""
"2011: Cory Joseph &gt; Jimmy Butler  2012: Festus Ezeli (pick traded to GS before draft) &gt; Jeffery Taylor  2013: Livio Jean-Charles &gt; Archie Goodwin  2014: Kyle Anderson &gt; Damien Inglis  2015: Nikola Milutinov &gt; Larry Nance Jr.  Butler and Nance would be significant upgrades over a journeyman backup PG and a big man who played zero NBA minutes respectively. Ezeli had a longer NBA career than Taylor, winning a championship with the Warriors even. Goodwin has the advantage of getting to play in the NBA compared to Jean-Charles. Anderson to Inglis is a major downgrade.  Not the end of the world though, given how the Spurs were in contention during this period."
"Kyle Anderson. I know the Slo Mo thing is his shtick, but Gollyyy! How so slow and in the NBA?"
Kyle Anderson. Easy
Kyle Anderson
"I‚Äôm trying to back out who isn‚Äôt since they wouldn‚Äôt say. Kyle Anderson, Ja, JJJ, Bane, Melton (first dose), Adams, and Clarke are confirmed vaccinated. Dillon wouldn‚Äôt say but sounded like he was. My money is on Tyus not being vaccinated."
most of the Memphis Grizzlies roster besides Ja and maybe Kyle Anderson bc his slowness just stands out
"In a mock offseason recently, I traded Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson for Danilo Gallinari, 2 unprotected 1st round picks, 2 future 1st round pick swaps, and 2 unprotected 2nd round picks and people hated it."
"It's actually far more useful than giving his position   Telling me someone is a SF is meaningless. Are they Otto porter? LeBron? Kyle Anderson?  Tell me someone is a point forward or a point center and I already have a very good idea of how they play  I get a much better idea of how Luka plays hearing Point forward (Lebron) than point guard (Curry, Dame)"
"Same answer as when someone posted after the hawks game 7 loss. Still easily Simmons. Strictly basketball only.     Simmons is the best on ball defender in the league. I feel he'd be well utilised as an off ball help defender as well if not on the sixers. On offense, honestly, whatever. If this is who he is now, the regular season version I mean. I'll take that. If not the Sixers/Portland, I think everyone else interested in him will do just fine without him as a 3 point threat.   Wiggins is the most disappointing 20 point per game scorer ever. Cliche as it is, the dude will have 20 on the box score and only be noticeable in a 2 minute spell where he as a few good defensive plays, a dunk and a 3 and then completely disappear. If need example, see 2 play in games. 1, against the Lakers where he did well when the warriors were on an awesome run in the first half and disappeared completely in the second in both ends. 2 Memphis, where I know he played but did he really? He got destroyed by Kyle Anderson. I don't think anything more needs to be said."
"Kyle Anderson slick dodging being #1 because the Grizzlies are, and will always remain, a .500 basketball team.  Kemba rooting for Memphis tonight against Toronto with Kyle having less than +19 confirmed."

Well guess who's the current FMVP while your boy didn't even MAKE the playoffs and got owned by Kyle Anderson LMAO imagine actually failing to make the playoffs because you can't beat the Grizzlies or washed LeBron  Fucking hilaaaaariouuuuus"
"Awww that's cute, a GSW fan trying to talk shit about our ring. How about you make the playoffs and not lose to Kyle Anderson before you talk about the playoffs? LMAO  Congrats on the 3rd place in MVP votes btw. Even funnier than scoring champion. It's kinda sad that you have no real arguments but you're trying your best and still coming short."
dude competing against kyle anderson for the slow mo title
Looks like he‚Äôs been working out with Kyle Anderson a bit too much
Most of the rotation besides Kyle Anderson will be back next year so in the worse case they could get good development. JJJ hopefully takes a leap in a larger role and maybe look to flip Adams
Kyle Anderson has such an awkward 3 point shot
"But he isn‚Äôt an overall detriment at all.  Every year since his sophomore seasons he‚Äôs a net positive, *ever* *single* season.  Is he untradable? No.  But he‚Äôs more valuable than the guys you mentioned. I like Kyle Anderson but Tillman doesn‚Äôt do anything for a team that has Nurkic, LNJ, Covington, and Little in the front court already and if you‚Äôre the Blazers aren‚Äôt you going for an upgrade and not a depth move?"
"Kyle ""Slow Mo"" Anderson. With a nickname like that and is in the NBA....this dude is special!"
I literally once saw Kyle Anderson  get a steal when he was with the spurs and took it coast to coast and i cant remember who but the defender ran from his basket and passed Kyle in mid court and ran in front of him and turned around and played D on him before Kyle got to the rim.   Usually like the defender is trailing you or if he's fast he almost on ur hip and you have to run him off a bit but the dude literally out ran Kyle to the opposing three line and just turned around before Anderson even got there.  KA must been like 22 at the time.  He's incredibly slow.
"This take only exists if you didn't watch the Grizzlies play last regular season. Jonas Valanciunas was the Grizzlies best regular season player, Kyle Anderson wasn't far off Ja either. Ja dealt with injuries and was very meh most of the season with highlight plays that just got pushed hard on social media.   19ppg on 53.7% TS with 7.4ast/3.2to while playing terrible defense is not noteworthy unless you have a massive narrative behind you."
Boris Diaw walked so that Kyle Anderson could also walk
Kyle Anderson is not fast or that athletic but he‚Äôs good
"My nominee is Kyle Anderson (SloMo). I love when he gets a steal, gets out on a fast break, multiple players on the other team catch up to him (and sometimes get around him so they can front him up!), and he still finishes.  I've only been to a couple NBA games live, but I was floored by how fast the game happens and the players move. I watch Anderson and just wonder how he has been able to consistently get it done at both ends, despite obviously operating at a totally different gear than everyone else.  Here you go. I watch this when I need a smile in my day. https://youtu.be/b0n-66VtIQc"
"Man, what happened to Kyle Anderson."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Imagine luka and Kyle Anderson playing together
Cade's floor: Kyle Anderson  Cade's ceiling: Khris Middleton with better playmaking  Green's floor: Marshon Brooks   Green's ceiling: Jordan Clarkson  Mobley's floor: Toothpick Al Horford  Mobley's ceiling: Kevin Garnett
"On Chris Vernon's Show yesterday, he was speculating that with how young the team is, they are getting caught up in being young kids and not being professional basketball players. With COVID last year and half of the previous season, these guys are finally allowed to go out and be 20 year olds. They were cooped up in their hotel rooms all last season and finally have some freedom.  No idea if that's true or not, but it's definitely an interesting speculation. We don't really have any vocal veteran leaders. Adams is 28, but he's not a vocal leader. Same with Kyle Anderson. Those aren't the guys who get everyone to do the right thing. Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill were HUGE for us in Ja's rookie season in being those older vets to show the young guys the ropes.   If this team is locked in, they can beat anyone. But god damn, can they also lose to anyone."
And Kyle Anderson. I see a lot of Kyle in Ziaire's length and passing.
Kyle Anderson
kyle anderson
&gt;https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU   &gt;   &gt;You gonna deny that?  Steph had as many no calls by himself against Kyle Anderson in 3 quarters as the Rockets did in that entire video lmfao.  [Gonna deny this?](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mzetu/bad_officiating_calls_in_warriorsrockets_g7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
Kyle Anderson-esque
Kyle Anderson?
The only correct answer is Kyle Anderson
I'm just as scared about Kyle Anderson honestly and he was mostly snuffed tonight so I'll take it
Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson? Can‚Äôt tell if his slowness is deliberate or unathletic
If Kyle Anderson can survive in this league then Paul Piece would thrive
It seems like JJJ is the bigger issue.  Is it possible Kyle Anderson is just flat out better than JJJ as a player and fit next to Ja is JJJ can't be a center.   Help wise Anderson is one of the best in the league.
"I'd say Kyle Anderson. He's in the contract year and i dont think we are going to pay him what he wants, also because he needs to start but he just dont fit well with JJJ."
"Same way Kyle Anderson does, understanding rhythm and pacing. He also does a ton of one legged/regular fade aways, requires more strength than agility."
Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson had threw his hat in the ring.
Kyle Anderson
"Niang was such a good pickup, probably Morey's best steal since Seth.   Not a great defender but his scoring is on point. Got a bit of a Kyle Anderson slowly vibe. Great bench guy."
Batum is y‚Äôall‚Äôs Kyle Anderson
"Alex Caruso,juan Tuscano Anderson,Patty Mills,Kyle Kuzma,Harrison Barnes"
I feel like I went to high school with  Kyle Anderson
Really? I feel like a lot of guys have gotten Kyle Anderson comps in the draft
Kyle Anderson
no one is more athletic than Kyle Anderson
"Ginobli was dunking over dues in his late 30s though. Giddey is more like a slightly more athletic Kyle Anderson imo  He's pretty good, but I don't think he deserves a Ginobili comp."
I want this team to win a championship. They have the ‚Äúwant‚Äù that most teams don‚Äôt have. They all have chips on their shoulders. I just think they need one more solid piece to fill that PF spot. I‚Äôm hoping that they can steal Jerami Grant away from Detroit or maybe Kyle Anderson.
"Why did you hate Jakob lol? It just seems random, he's a good role player that hasn't done much of note. It's like hating on George Hill or Kyle Anderson."
Need to have a 1v1 with Kyle Anderson. Slow mo vs slow mo lmao
"Yes, last year, when he couldn't even make the playoffs and lost to Kyle Anderson"
Turkish Kyle Anderson out here
My boy Kyle Anderson
He‚Äôs basically KD crossed with Kyle Anderson
"Adams is more versatile and mobile, but JV is way better in the drop scheme that Jenkins loves to run. Plus Grayson Allen was kind of underrated as a defender, he looks shitty but he's actually got long arms and he works really hard getting over screens. And finally, for most of this season Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson haven't started, they were very important to last season's defense."
Kyle Anderson would like a word
Kyle Anderson crossed with KD
"Absolutely. It's such a strange formula for success that keeps working.  In the past decade, they've had back-half FRPs pan out like nobody's business.   Kyle Anderson, Cory Joseph, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker. None of these guys had any significant playing time their rookie year. Maybe they know something we don't."
No Dillon brooks until this game and reduced kyle anderson minutes are a big part of it
"Very methodical, doesn‚Äôt seem like he‚Äôs gonna blow by but gets exactly where he wants to go and uses his length to finish or pull up for a midrange. Kinda like Kyle Anderson in guard form lol except he‚Äôs shiftier/a bit quicker. But just never in a hurry, plays at his own pace."
kyle anderson has prepared his whole life for this
"If anything, wouldn't the modern day Spurs be the talent farm?  Bryn Forbes, Johnathan Simmons, Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Ian Mahinmi, all started on the Spurs and became key rotation players, got a big contract, and/or won a chip.   I could be missing some people. I wasnt sure if I should add kawhi in that."
Joins Kyle Korver and Justin Anderson as the only players to score 5 or fewer point on 12+ 3PA.
lol weird to use tim duncan as an example of someone being slow on a fast break...kyle anderson i get...boban i get...but prime tim duncan was athetlic lol

Kyle Anderson dribbling in slowmo
The Kyle Anderson euro
"Nah, I get what you‚Äôre saying, but if you play basketball then you know what it‚Äôs like playing against a slow footed person. Cade isn‚Äôt that, but being slow can absolutely be a significant disadvantage in basketball. It‚Äôs a valid criticism, but neither Luka nor Kyle Anderson are slow footed nor slow in the ‚Äúquick‚Äù sense, even if they both have pretty weak 40 times.   Straight line speed doesn‚Äôt matter, but being slow footed/not agile makes you easy pickings off the dribble, especially if you have space to operate in."
so is Kyle Anderson
"I can tell you now Desmond Bane,De‚Äôanthony Melton, and Kyle Anderson will never be all stars"
Kyle Anderson and running slowly. Man is molasses in a basketball jersey.
"Great team game. I mentioned Jaren but shout-out to Kyle Anderson, Bane, Melton and Adams for playing well on both ends and making plays on offense. Zaire giving us good minutes too. Ja had an ""off"" game and was still impactful. Can't wait to get Dillon back!! On to the next one üêªüí™üèæüò§"
Kyle Anderson was brought up a lot during the draft process.  That‚Äôs gonna be him if he never pans out
They really took Kyle Anderson with the first overall pick didn't they
"To be fair, Kyle Anderson was a top 3 prospect in his HS class, too."
I think he's a smaller Kyle Anderson.
poor mans kyle anderson
"Dude is so unathletic, it's scary  Did the Pistons draft Kyle Anderson with the #1 pick?"
"Honestly, and I mean this as a compliment, plays like Kyle Anderson if he wasn't slow. Everything is controlled, uses his length to move around players on offense and make passes around guys,  and the shot looks a stiff but damn if it doesn't go in more than it looks like it should."
I don‚Äôt know the specifics but if the bulls can get Kyle Anderson without giving up too much that would be sweet. He can play that Thad Young role

"Lol that's not true at all. Tons of guys would've gotten the spurs more wins than DeRozan did. And our roster was not that bad. We basically swapped Kyle Anderson, Manu Ginobili, and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl and weren't any better. Then we were significantly worse the next two seasons. There's a lot of revisionist history going on in this thread about DeRozan."
"he's a really bad rim protector for the very reason that he cant defend without fouling and is constantly out of position.. the grizz were a top 10 defense when kyle anderson was starting at the 4 and as soon as jaren came back the defense went to shit. i know, i was watching. he literally got benched in the play-in game against the warriors for xavier tillman."
A real Kyle Anderson!
"Trey ""Kyle Anderson"" Lyles"
"Did anyone else see Kyle Anderson mug Igoudala so that he couldn't play help defense? Kind of an egregious offensive foul.   Great play by Morant, but I wonder if he pulls it off without  Kyle Anderson, given how good of a help defender Igoudala is."
Kyle Anderson is the glue to this team üò§

"Add Xavier Tillman, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones and Ziaire Williams. Good depth"
"Missed two consecutive free throws, had a stupid unforced turnover and got blocked by Kyle Anderson. Fuck Iggy."
Kyle Anderson moves like he was manufactured In a workshop and not conceived in a womb
Every Grizz player except Kyle Anderson had a steal. We've got some dawgs
Kyle Anderson even fouls in slow motion
Kyle Anderson
what happens when you go from starting kyle anderson at the 4 to jjj
"Ah yes, Kyle Anderson the protagonist"
"never in a million years would I guess a Memphis vs. GSW game would go to Memphis in fucking OT, and reffed by Scott mf Foster.  But damn, Ja earned my respect. dude is clutch. shoutout to Kyle Anderson and Xavier for clutch shots."
"Grizz goin‚Äô grizz!  Jaaaa!!  Woooo!   I‚Äôm a Spurs fan, but Memphis is my 1a, oddly enough...and Damn I‚Äôm so proud of those guys!  Kyle Anderson especially...it hurt like hell losing him to free agency, but I love seeing how he‚Äôs thrived in Memphis.  Can‚Äôt wait to see the Grizz give em hell in Utah!!"
Slooooooow Mooooo. Love me some Kyle Anderson
Grizzlies spent the last 10 possessions trying to iso Ja  Morant and Kyle Anderson against him.  Kawhi and Lebron definitely rest on the defensive end but you‚Äôll still never see a team trying to iso them.  If we can acknowledge his greatness offensively we also have to acknowledge how bad he is on the other end.
People out here breaking their ass trying catch up to kyle Anderson
"Not much, just murmurs that Mr. Anderson felt Pop didn't play Kyle enough and that the Spurs were bad for his prospects.  Probably right on both counts, in retrospect."
lol Kyle Anderson talks some shit I love it
"I‚Äôm sorry I just came here to vent.   Why are people bashing the Grizzlies/ Jazz series?   Will it be a sweep? Probably, Probably not.   But I feel this is much better than whatever we would‚Äôve gotten with the Warriors.   This is the same shit that got Steph that damn MVP nod. (I know he had a god like year) but the fans are like ‚Äúno ones watching Jazz/Grizzlies‚Äù   yea it doesn‚Äôt have a true superstar in it. But still bro it‚Äôs basketball stop bitching about the series if you aren‚Äôt gonna watch it. I wanna see Valanciunas vs Gobert , Mike Conley going back to Memphis. Kyle Anderson vs Joe ingles.   TF? What‚Äôs all this complaining about?   I hate this meat riding ass league and it‚Äôs fans sometimes man damn"
they called a foul on curry against kyle anderson with 55 seconds left to give the grizzlies the lead.
Careless pass. They think that kyle anderson can't intercept them. lol
"I hate my life and JORDAN POOLE, KENT BAZEMORE , GRAYSON ALLEN , DILLON BROOKS , KYLE ANDERSON. Jordan poole for that nasty turover"
bro yeah. see how hard they were denying him in the 4th and OT. kyle anderson had to bring it up a bunch because of how ja was guarded
Awesome game. KYLE FUCKING ANDERSON WAS HUGE.   Watching Andrew Wiggins is always a strange experience. Wouldn't surprise me if the dude probably had 20 again but again though.
Everybody gonna talk about Ja vs Steph and rightly so but Kyle Anderson a God at this shit. Let it be known Slo-Mo did the damn thing.
As a neutral this game was amazing. Huge props to Kyle Anderson he made so many smart reads. In the future ja retrospectives this game is gonna be the game that puts ja into stardom territory
"Kyle Anderson just put on an absolute master class. Warriors just could not figure out how to score consistently with him on the floor. The possession he had when the Warriors had the ball with a minute left in OT is one of the best defensive possessions I've ever seen from a player. Maybe the most underrated player in the NBA because most of what he does never shows up in a box score, but the Grizzlies would've been absolute toast without him."
Kyle Anderson played like a bootleg Magic Johnson
"His hairline got me fucked up, his slowmo got me fucked up, his defense got me fucked up. Kyle Anderson? That mans fucked up."
Awesome game. KYLE FUCKING ANDERSON WAS HUGE.   Watching Andrew Wiggins is always a strange experience. Wouldn't surprise me if the dude probably had 20 again but again though.
"Shoutout to Spurs Legend Kyle Anderson, miss you Slo Mo"
"First of all, Steph is incredible.   Second, put some damn respect on Ja Morant and the Grizzlies! I don't care if you didn't wanna see us play the Jazz, we just balled out. Ja outplayed everyone on that floor. Dillon Brooks is electric on defense and a supremely underrated two way player. Kyle Anderson came up huge. We beat the refs and the Warriors tonight. Give us our damn respect! Memphis vs Errbody!"
Kyle Anderson got that middle age man hairstyle
"no they're not, they're bottom 3 in every metric  Ja often plays in line ups with Kyle Anderson, Brooks (34% from 3) and Valanciunas, and he himself is a 30% pt shooter. That's awful"
"Technically off Kyle Anderson but for 45 minutes of regulation, that would not be called off Anderson"
"Kyle Anderson and Juan Toscano Anderson fight for the ball and it goes out of bounds.  ""Looks like it went off of Anderson.""  Grade A commentary."
"I like how Jackson waits for the super slo-mo close up replay to say ""I mean Kyle Anderson, by the way."""
Give Kyle Anderson a post up clear out on Steph.  Foul him out.
"Now they're gonna challenge that right, where it was obviously off Kyle Anderson. Fucking christ."
Kyle Anderson has been a giant net negative
That‚Äôs one ugly free throw shot by Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson is an unfortunate looking gentleman.
fouling kyle anderson is lol
Kyle Anderson has a shocking hairline
steph needs to be able to keep Kyle Anderson in front of him at least
Kyle Anderson look like Steph and Klay had a baby.
Kyle Anderson got a big ass forehead
kyle anderson is too elite
Does Kyle Anderson have the biggest forehead in the league?
Kyle Anderson is what would happen if the old man at the gym that kills it with craftyness went super sayian
Kyle Anderson slaps the raging Toscano-Anderson in the butt  üòÇ
I'm pretty sure Kyle Anderson just traveled but it was so slow they didn't call it lol
"Do you think if Kyle Anderson kissed Curry on the lips, that Steph would become slow too?"
Steph cant get a bucket on Kyle Anderson meanwhile Cole Anthony hitting game winners over his head
Kyle Anderson looks not so slow mo tonight
kyle anderson elite defender
Kyle Anderson playing the best defensive game of his life lmao
kyle anderson elite blocker
God damn Kyle Anderson can play some D!
"If you fall for a kyle anderson pump fake then you deserve to lose, i'm sorry"
kyle anderson is legit stop hatin
Kyle Anderson is somehow an elite shot blocker
First the 2019 finals now Kyle Anderson eating the zaza revenge tour is still on
Kyle Anderson just screamed out ‚Äúfuck zaza‚Äù after Tillman hit that 3 the man wants some revenge for 2017
"Watching Kyle Anderson is wild, he's so fucking slow but everything looks so clean"
Kyle Anderson looks like he's just hopping around cause he's so slow lol
Lol Draymond casually tackling Kyle Anderson in the back
Wait.... isn‚Äôt kyle anderson solid af
"If you're a high school baller, model your game after Kyle Anderson"
Kyle Anderson as your backup 3 and no back up sg. Not even close
Kyle Anderson always leaves me impressed one way or another. Tough putback
Kyle Anderson being called a veteran makes me feel old and I don‚Äôt like it
"""Kyle Anderson is never rushed""   physically incapable of moving quickly"
Warriors are definitely more experienced but JV and Kyle Anderson have playoff experience so hopefully they can bring some composure
Odds Draymond takes out Kyle Anderson early?
"I'd like to add that Kyle Anderson, Tyus, and Brandon Clarke love floaters/push shots as much as Ja/JV. Like the other commentator said they lead the league in floaters by far.  However them not getting all the way to the rim means the offense really dries up when those tough looks don't go down."
"Even if we get a friendly whistle, they can only do so much. If Jonas Valanciunas and Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks are hitting everything, we're screwed unless Steph goes off. Also I have a bad feeling Ja hits his threes today. Bad shooters always seem to go off against us"
It is. Wat Misaka was his name. Unless you count Kyle Anderson who's 1/8th Chinese or Jordan Clarkson who's half Filipino.
"&gt;Also don‚Äôt leave Kyle Anderson open from 3  2021 is fucking crazy bro lol. People bitched for years about his lack of an outside shot, the covid break let him get his shoulders right and he showed promise in the bubble. We love W3T KYL3"
"It depends. If our players think of it about how we lost a 1 possession ball game versus the defending champs while the Grizzlies won a game by 4 with the 33-39 Spurs shooting 35% from the field we may have that boost.   That being said, Jonas has played really well the last few games and our best game plan would be to expose him on defense and get him and brooks in foul trouble. If the Grizzlies shoot slightly better from 3 than last time (almost inevitable) we won‚Äôt be able to clog the paint as we did in the second half     The good news is our bench seems to have been performing better than theirs recently.    Also don‚Äôt leave Kyle Anderson open from 3, his shot always looks like it‚Äôs inevitably going on when he‚Äôs open."
"Yep. Like Tacko Fall Kyle Anderson Bismack Biyombo Gorgui Dieng, eh?"
"Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson are randomly two of my favorite players in the league. Both of them hustle a ton and Anderson especially I feel like just does all the little things. Feel like they carry on the Grit and Grind mentality as much as anybody on the team. Anybody have a clip of the Melton/Anderson blocks on the fast break and then Anderson yells at his teammates (not in a bad way) to get back on defense? Also Grizzlies fans, how has JJJ been since his return? He was mostly quiet for the part of the game I got to see but does it look like he's taking the right steps to be back at 100% next season?        I feel like the Grizzlies have a legit shot against the Warriors tomorrow but I'm also assuming Silver will call in the refs to get Brooks in foul trouble early. Probably some calls that normally don't get called to free up Steph. In any case, it's going to be a tough/frustrating game so Brooks is going to have to be careful not to get too upset and pick up another tech."
"yeah. While you could say Ja and J3 are the future, the present is JV and Brooks. And sometimes Kyle Anderson."
1 and 2 contenders maybe. Current GOAT is Kyle Anderson naturally
" Kyle Anderson, Mo Wagner, and Payton Pritchard ain‚Äôt playing rn"
They deserve it. I just saw Kyle Anderson take the slowest 3 ever and it was wide open
Either him or Kyle Anderson
My takeaway from this game is that Kyle Anderson is fantastic defensively.
Kyle Anderson is so damn good on D.
The way Kyle Anderson moves on the court is genuinely baffling to me
kyle anderson needs to show up at least a little
Kyle Anderson is the same type of guy
The Rudy Gay revenge game or the Kyle Anderson revenge game. Gotta love the storylines within the storyline
This just in ‚Äî Kyle Anderson has been cast as the lead in the Mr. Meeseeks biopic.
"""I got back to this end and I'm KYLE FUCKING ANDERSON where were you?"""
Kyle Anderson is too slow to defend properly.. shit is unfair lol
Kyle Anderson is actually incredible to watch
"Yeah I definitely agree. I also think there‚Äôs a lot of guys who are so good at their role that I value them more than a lower impact young guy putting up good numbers on a bad team.   I think having guys like Kyle Anderson, Jarrett Allen, Joe Ingles, Robert Covington helps teams win more than Garland. Ingles is a pretty egregious omission from this list imo."
Kyle Anderson
Who‚Äôs next? Kyle Andersonü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I liked the ringer‚Äôs argument that Kyle Anderson going from probably dropping out of the league to a solid rotation player deserves some consideration, but yeah Randle is gonna win the award"
"It simply isn't a debate though. Steph scored more but that is really about it. Jokic ended the season with a 131 oRTG, Steph's career high was 125 and was only at 119 this year. Jokic was also better defensively by every metric this year. Jokic had a PER 5 higher, a WS/48 of .304 compared to .202. A higher oBPM by 1.2 and dBPM by 2.5. Higher VORP by 3.1. RAPTOR has his WAR 5.4 above Steph, that is the same gap as Steph to Kyle Anderson"
Finding out if Kyle Anderson is jewish.
/r/NBA: I want to be Kyle Anderson rn üò©üò©
Kyle Anderson gave him arabian goggles
He‚Äôs basically sucking Kyle Anderson cock
Kyle Anderson teabagged Steph's face lmao
They really zoomed in on Steph topping off Kyle Anderson
Y‚Äôall can now understand why Kyle Anderson grades as our most impactful player this season

Kyle Anderson is quickly becoming one of my favorites
Kyle Anderson is messing with my brain. It feels like he's not moving in real time.
Dillon Brooks is just the evil Kyle Anderson
"He hovers to scoop the ball into the bucket, like floating on air Kyle Anderson is a hovering bucket!"
That was the fastest I have ever seen Kyle Anderson move
Lmao Kyle Anderson fast break to the front page
Kyle Anderson has to have the slowest release I've ever seen
Imagine actually losing Kyle Anderson on D
Lol Kyle Anderson doing the drax so slow he's invisible cut to the bucket
"His outside shot is jacked up and with JJJ back, Kyle Anderson is too good at the backup 4 to get taken out for someone who has minimal playmaking and cramps spacing"
"Mostly missing Bryn Forbes, Kyle Anderson, and Boban."
Kyle Anderson esque
This will just be motivation for Kyle Anderson to play at an even slower pace.
"Damn you're right. And since it's Kyle Anderson, he'll still get the job done."
Kyle Anderson touching himself vigorously as he watches Luka's speed.

Kyle Anderson is the GOAT when it comes to this move
"Luka ""Kyle Anderson"" Doncic"
He‚Äôs got those Kyle Anderson speed changes - slow to really slow and then back to slow again. And it works. It works really well.
"The ""Kyle Anderson fast break"" school of scoring"
kyle anderson got a vote lets go
Kyle Anderson getting votes hell yes
"I think one of the issues for Kyle Anderson and contracts is people know he‚Äôs pretty much at the top of his game. They know they are getting a decent role player who can sometimes be relied on for heavy minutes but he‚Äôs not a true starter. If Kyle Anderson is one of the worst players in your rotation then that‚Äôs great, if he‚Äôs one of the best guys then your team is in trouble. People with a few stars can‚Äôt afford that price for Kyle Anderson and teams who can afford to pay that are hamstrung trying to afford better players if they sign him.   Ultimately I think he will have quite a few options. Does he want to sign for less on a contender or does he want to secure the bag and remain on a 6-8 playoff team at best."
I think Kyle Anderson is a winning player and he's my favorite of the three. Valanciunas is probably the most valuable
pretty straightforward to me. in the Tezuka Zone all the balls you hit go right back to him. Kyle Anderson sucks you into his gravitational pull so you can't go any faster than he wants you to
Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson and the slow mo fast break

"Kyle ""Prius"" Anderson slowing down the fast lane every night"
Kyle Anderson plays basketball like Phil Mickelson played golf this weekend. Slow and methodical.
Kyle Anderson is that dude in the 1989 Hyundai Pony that always somehow picks the perfect lane to be in during a traffic jam.  You try to follow him to get by but just for some reason the seams are only open for him.
Kyle Anderson
"He's ultra physical, and now that he has the reputation ref will become nicer with him, defensive reputation is almost as big as star reputation on offense, he also has decent foot speed, and is really strong, he can get trough any screens.   I'll say he's meh as a defensive ""playmaker"" he doesn't really create turnover off ball, but he plays with Kyle Anderson who is basically one of the 2 best player in NBA at doing that so those two are the absolute perfect fit on defense"
"Flagrant 2, Kyle Anderson is ejected for imploding KD‚Äôs head"
Jenkins is coaching basketball like a pitcher. He knows it's best to play 4 fastballs and a change-up on the court. No one is ready for the 60mph pitch that is kyle Anderson
"Kyle Anderson is actually The Flash so he has to fake a ""normal"" run to avoid exposing his secret identity but is unsure how fast normal NBA athletes actually are and overcompensates far too much."
"Forget the Steph Slide, kids r gonna be doing the Kyle ""Slo-Mo"" Anderson in a couple of years"
"Some years ago, would be hard to believe that Kyle Anderson would outlast Shabazz Muhammad in NBA."
Kyle Anderson is the basketball equivalent of a knuckball pitch.
Make Pop proud Kyle Anderson
&gt; unless they have that superhuman bounce and length  i need to see kyle anderson isolating against derrick jones jr. for 48 minutes
Jokic and Doncic can change direction really well and misdirect their defenders with shiftiness. Kyle Anderson is just flat out really slow
Grizzles go down 1-3. Kyle Anderson proceeds to take off his ankle weights.
Kyle Anderson is the NBA‚Äôs Orange Cassidy
Wow is Kyle Anderson actually the Timelord?
I‚Äôve never heard the word languid before yet I feel like it perfectly fits Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson 6 steals and he had like 2 more that they called BS fouls on.
i enjoy Kyle Anderson highlights
"Kyle ""the slowest fastbreak"" Anderson"
Kyle Anderson is the equivalent of when a pitcher comes in and starts throwing 60 MPH fastballs.  Throws off the whole team
"I wasn‚Äôt even talking about fans, just the players getting really into it. I love the jazz and watch most of y'all's games when Mike is playing. It was just bizarre seeing people come off the bench to shove Kyle Anderson for example (that move by Rudy was extremely fucking bushleague btw). Good luck the rest of the series though, I'm satisfied even if that's the only win we get. We showed we deserve to be here and the experience is worth more than anything."
I love watching Kyle Anderson play. The SLO mo is hilarious but it's even better that it's tactically effective
We already have Evil Steph Curry in Kyle Anderson
"Kyle Anderson picked up Bojan after he missed the last shot. Respect for him, no respect for Rudy Floppert"
Good to see these young guys get playoff experience. Kyle Anderson was so important tonight as well.
"Kyle Anderson is just a taller, slower-moving Steph Curry imo"
Kyle Anderson is one of those dudes who gets looked over but just makes winning play after winning play
Kyle Anderson makes winning plays only. Coach Pop has got that fucking Midas touch for BBIQ.

Kyle Anderson was awesome too. Love this team

Kyle Anderson is the most important Grizz player. Don't @ me.

Kyle Anderson had enough of the shit
I forever miss Kyle Anderson
Kyle Anderson watches bballbreakdown.
"yall are crazy, kyle anderson did the right play, theres 6 seconds left on the clock, theyre up 1 and jazz have only 1 timeout left - you do not give them a chance at a 3, they are shooters  all the grizzlies gotta do is make some FTs"
"Kyle Anderson is exactly the kind of guy every team needs in these situations, really under appreciated player."
Kyle Anderson big brain move
Lol. Kyle Anderson on the Grizzlies is slo-mo
Kyle Anderson smart af
Heads up by Kyle Anderson there
Kyle Anderson is so smart. Spurs smart
Kyle Anderson with two disgustingly bad fouls in the final 2 minutes.
"Kyle ""The Politician"" Anderson"
"Scouts be obsessed over every prospects first-step and how explosive it is, then we have Kyle Anderson over here messing with people playing as slow as he can"
Absolute vintage Kyle Anderson
"Love that he knows how to use his speed (or lack thereof) to finish on fast breaks. It's almost more exciting seeing Kyle Anderson go coast to coast, rather than a high flyer whose gonna yam it"
I feel like Kyle Anderson is gonna have a long career just because his movements don't really tax his body as much.
Welcome to the Y!  *‚Äì Kyle Anderson*
Well Kyle Anderson certainly can't be accused of playing out of control
"Kyle Anderson actually is moving at ultra instinct speeds, our mortal eyes just can‚Äôt comprehend it."
Kyle Anderson so slow he confused the defense on that fast break.
The Kyle Anderson slow break
The Kyle Anderson fast break is the greatest play in NBA history.
I love Kyle Anderson
Yeah because Kyle Anderson can play defense. Giddy cant
"Kyle Anderson avg 14.6 ppg, 8.8 rpg, and (drum roll please) 6.5 apg (which is tremendous for college basketball) his 2nd year at UCLA. He's Kyle Anderson without the defense. He won't be anything special."
He's Kyle Anderson without the defense
He's Kyle Anderson without the defense for me. He hasnt shown anything impressive at all. He's slow with the ball and he cant shoot.
"After last year, Kyle Anderson isn't really an insult unless you're calling someone an all star. SloMo is a truly strong NBA player."
I mean Kyle Anderson was over 6 a game his last year at UCLA. He was known as a playmaker coming out of college.
"The next Kyle Anderson.  Good luck, kid. Those are gonna be some large shoes to fill."
"Thanks for making sense   Kyle Anderson would've been a huge addition, and for minimal in return.  GSW is already paying this much, either go all in or rebuild. Don't waste the primes of your championship core"
"Welp‚Ä¶we could see if Memphis is interested in Wiseman + Paschall for Dillon Brooks + Desmand Bane OR Kyle Anderson + Ziaire + Bane   Then look to trade Wiggins + Kuminga + a future pick(s) for Siakam   Steph / Klay / Brooks / Siakam / Dray  Poole / Bane / Moody / JTA / Looney  Fills the holes on the wing with Brooks + Siakam, keeps some ready to contribute youth in Poole, Bane and Moody  Target a center and backup pg with the TPMLE and vet mins  BUT as far as I can tell, Myers definitely talked to both Memphis and Toronto - so who knows whether these deals were discussed or even available"
"&gt; Lol you‚Äôre missing the point - there is a minimum number of roster spots you HAVE to fill  I‚Äôm not missing the point, you‚Äôre just making it out to be a bigger problem than it is.  Kelly Oubre was both more expensive and a worse player than Kyle Anderson, there‚Äôs already precedent.  I agree it‚Äôs expensive, but if you‚Äôre gonna have the most expensive roster to try and compete in Steph‚Äôs prime, actually get yourself the best playoff rotation possible, don‚Äôt just build an expensive roster in the first place to a second round exit because you have to give bench wing minutes to an unproven rookie because you want to avoid going 100% all in on this vision"
I loved the Grizz/Warriors play-in game. Dylan Brooks &amp; Kyle Anderson were dogs in that game. Also the Warriors kept daring Ja to shoot 3s &amp; he kept making them. Awesome game.
They've done a good job getting role players in the draft that can contribute early and got major contributions from guys like JV and Kyle Anderson. Absolutely no doubt the value they got for Crowder / Iggy / Hill and now taking on Bledsoe / Adams has been unarguably waaaaaaay under what it should have been.
"big 6‚Äô8 playmaking wing that aren‚Äôt the best athletes and mediocre ball handlers that get by with skills and IQ who have a pretty solid all around game. Idk how many players that describe, maybe Kyle Anderson too but he has a very distinctive playstyle so you wouldn‚Äôt really make the comparison"
"&gt; Well now the warriors have to replace 3 of those roster spots with min guys  That‚Äôs a positive considering how bad the bench played last year. The Lakers literally built a better bench off the scrap heap  If they weren‚Äôt Warriors players, you wouldn‚Äôt be defending them. No one gives a shit outside your org about Mychal Mulder and Allen Smailagic and Eric Paschall. None of them get into a playoff rotation like Kyle Anderson does  &gt; Is Lacob supposed to pay $60M for Kyle Anderson  Depends how much he wants to increase his chance at winning a chip"
"Ok, so let‚Äôs say the Warriors traded Lee + Mulder + Smailagic + Paschall + 7 for Anderson + 10  Well now the warriors have to replace 3 of those roster spots with min guys  That extra $6-7M in payroll just added $50M to the luxury tax.  Is Lacob supposed to pay $60M for Kyle Anderson?"
It‚Äôs def Kyle Anderson szn I hope lmao
They should have done Kyle Anderson + 7 for 10
Kyle Anderson is the closest one
Kyle Anderson
Probably doesn't have the athleticism to take advantage of his mental game but who knows. For every Kendall Marshall there's also a Kyle Anderson as far as guys who can or can't deal with limited athleticism
"I offered you Siakam and OG for Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Murray, Keldon and White... You're taking that deal."
"Murray, White, Walker IV, Keldon Johnson, Vassell, and shit even Kyle Anderson are all solid starter level to rotation level players. Primo could end up being a reach but can't deny the potential. Throw in Kawhi/Cory and to me that seems like hitting on 9/13 picks in that stretch. Casual take."
"White, Murray, and Johnson are all good players. Kyle Anderson and Cory Joseph both had paid after their rookie deals in SA. Walker/Vassell are too young to tell. Plus... they scouted and hit on Kawhi... regardless if every other pick flopped, they rang Erneh."
Yes. Kawhi Leonard at 15 - incredible pick. Kyle Anderson at 30 - great pick. Dejounte Murray at 29 - great pick. Derrick White at 29 - great pick. Keldon Johnson at 29 - great pick. We drafted an MVP caliber player and 4 starter level players while having no lottery picks until last year.
"That‚Äôs an outstanding draft record  Pick 15 for an MVP level player is amazing.  Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Murray, Keldon and White as solid role players at 28-30 is as solid as you can get with those picks."
"2019 29th pick Keldon Johnson  2017 29th pick Derrick White  2016 29th pick Dejounte Murray  2014 30th pick Kyle Anderson  These are all picks within the last decade that are solid role players for any team. All picked late first round, which is more than what some teams hope to get at that spot. Maybe I'm wrong and Primo becomes a bust, but their track record has been pretty good imo"
"I think we would have if Kuminga was off the board. If Scottie Barnes was still on, for example, or Giddey, I think we would have slid back to 10 and hoped for Mitchell (even though he did end up going 9 to SAC which feels early and unexpected)  We still could have had Krispert, Kyle Anderson/Bane, and Moody which would be nice.  Idk if that offer was still on the table when the 7 pick came up, and even if it was I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd pass on Kuminga"
In hindsight I guess so. But I don‚Äôt see how if Memphis wants to trade up we wouldn‚Äôt have asked for Bane. Kyle Anderson is nice but we don‚Äôt need a back up PF imo. I actually prefer JTA to Kyle Anderson. Just my homer opinion I guess.
If anything he can still be a sf like Kyle Anderson. Such and advantage being 6‚Äô8
I know. Why didn‚Äôt the FO panic and trade 7 to the Grizzlies for 10 and Kyle Anderson????
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
"Our last non big man draft pick besides Luka Samaic, who has done really nothing to show he can be a rotational player, is Kyle Anderson. 7 years ago.  Wtf."
"Can you hype me up on him?  Even if I believe in Sam Presti's drafting, I had zero excitement for Giddey even before we took him. I feel like we just took a Kyle Anderson without the fun Slo-Mo memes. Boring Kyle Anderson is not a player I can find hype about."
"Absolutely. He might not have a high top speed, but he reaches his top speed super quickly.   I mean - he's not some kind of Kyle Anderson."
"One of my favorite things is when playmakers pass the ball into an empty corner and just stare down whoever was supposed to have been there. So great.  One time rookie or sophomore Kyle Anderson messed up and vacated a corner that he was supposed to be in. One of the vets on the Spurs passed right into the empty corner, and you could see the entire bench stand up and point right at Kyle like, ""that was Kyle's fault. Don't blame insert-Spurs-player-here."""
Kyle Anderson is probably an option.
"I wonder who the Grizzlies are trying to trade up for, surely Mobley is out of their reach and they're pretty well set at PG, SG/SF and PF depending on if they want to keep Kyle Anderson."
What no one is really saying is that Kyle Anderson is the best fit for the Warriors. He can fit that Livingston role that they thrived with. I could see 10+ Anderson for 7
Kyle Anderson is probably the guy their offering the Warriors. They'd have to take Looney back to make it work. Anderson is another expiring like Valanciunas and he's going to be getting a raise. Grizzlies probably want someone closer to Ja &amp; Jackson's age range rather than spending 12M or so on Anderson.
"I‚Äôm not offended I‚Äôm just done wasting time on this. I know who Kyle Anderson is. I‚Äôve been aware of him since he was with the Spurs. I guarantee you have watched the Warriors less than 10 times but guess what, that‚Äôs not an issue to me. I‚Äôm not responding anymore and I was a little hesitant in even typing this out. I‚Äôm just telling you straight up the Warriors FO is not giving up 7 for Kyle Anderson and 10. In perfectly fine with that. Again good luck to your FO for finding a trade partner 1-6 for 10 and Kyle Anderson. I just don‚Äôt see it happening."
"I actually think you guys giving up 7 for Kyle Anderson, #10, and the Lakers first makes a lot of sense. Kyle Anderson would be a huge addition depth wise, and I can see him fitting in very well with Wiggins during the minutes Steph is off the floor."
There is just as many people discussing Bane and 10 for 7 so that‚Äôs just as possible but you act like you‚Äôre getting robbed. I figure your FO has a hard on for Kuminga. If you want a player that bad you have to pay for it. It‚Äôs a simple as that. You can‚Äôt get something for nothing.   One thing for sure is you are very highly overrating your players. I get it. It‚Äôs your team but please do not let your love of your team warp your perception of reality. Kyle Anderson is not a valuable enough commodity to move up from 10 to 7 in this draft.
Kyle Anderson maybe
Trust me. Anderson and 10 for 7 is not happening. The value to GSW is not there. We can possibly draft Kuminga and have a very valuable trade chip down the line that is way more valuable then Kyle Anderson.  Now maybe I need to accuse you of not watching Warriors games. JTA was not a SG last season he played PF in the same way Draymond does for us.
So now even Kyle fucking Anderson and the 10 is an overpay for 7? I don‚Äôt think you understand player value. It‚Äôs not a good thing he‚Äôs expiring to GSW we‚Äôre over cap already. Why would we trade down just for a 1 year rental that lets be honest isn‚Äôt helping us that much. I don‚Äôt see Kyle Anderson as an improvement over JTA to be honest with you.
JV was also the most known commodity on the team. Everyone else is young besides Kyle Anderson who has improved a decent bit in the past two seasons himself
"That‚Äôs the point, a trade *wouldnt* work here. Clearly we‚Äôre not getting Brooks, and clearly you‚Äôre not moving up for just Kyle Anderson or Desmond Bane. There‚Äôs no trade here that makes sense for both sides.. so either the grizzlies overpay to move up to #7, or they find a different trade partner"
"Lmao, imagine trying to sell me on Bane like we‚Äôd be lucky to get him for the #7 in this years draft. At the end of the day this trade ain‚Äôt happening, dubs make no sense as a trade partner for the grizzlies.. I understand we‚Äôre not getting Brooks, but you gotta understand you‚Äôre not moving up just for Kyle Anderson or Desmond Bane. There‚Äôs no way to come up with a trade that works for both sides here.   Seems like the Grizzlies will either have to overpay if they really wanna move up, or just pick at #10 and be happy with it"
"Desmond Bane was one of the best shooters in the league last season as a rookie, and is an athletic stud and great on defense. You‚Äôd be lucky to get him, which you won‚Äôt. You‚Äôll probably get Kyle Anderson. At the end of the day, you‚Äôre not getting Brooks. Our FO has made it pretty clear he‚Äôs a big part of our future. Just because the Wizards said they‚Äôre interested in him doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre interested in trading him. You‚Äôve got to be realistic, and thinking that one of our most important players is worth moving up three spots isn‚Äôt anywhere close to realistic. Plus you don‚Äôt have the salary to make it work."
"It's interesting that he gets so much attention as the Grizzlies' best defender when I actually think Kyle Anderson is better by a decent margin (elite hands, overwhelming length, can guard wings and the 4). Brooks is great at harassing guys one-on-one but he's not especially long or quick, doesn't have great hands, and fouls way too much. I'm also not sure how great his team defense really is."
"Yeah, I agree, Kyle Anderson, Scottie Pippen and Boris Diaw all came to my mind, but all of them were repurposed as point-forwards."
"I think most would consider 6‚Äô5 to be tall for a PG. 6‚Äô7 is extra but if that‚Äôs your requirement, it‚Äôs your post. Probably won‚Äôt find a big sample size in general because most 6‚Äô7 guys are repurposed for the NBA if they don‚Äôt have legitimate PG skills.   Kyle Anderson comes to mind. Dude had some PG skills but got repurposed given his size and lack of athleticism to compete against other NBA PGs"
"If Giddey was black, the comp would be Kyle Anderson"
"I've noticed a lot of former Grizzlies in the Olympics: Haddadi, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Watanabe. Team USA also should have invited Kyle Anderson in my opinion."
So a rich man's Kyle Anderson?
"Bullshit.  Back then SAC still believed in Fox, Hield, and Bogdan. Plus there were already ballhandling arguments.   Fan opinions on Luka were split 60/40. People had legitimate worries about his athleticism.  Personally I was on the JJJ train with a side of ""Luka should be fine, look at Kyle Anderson""."
Kyle anderson dosnt fit the raotors team but hes one of my favourite players to watch and id love to have him on the team
We would like one kyle anderson please. :)
i would absolutely love to have kyle anderson on the blazers
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
The Grizzlies could throw in Kyle Anderson the most athletic athlete of all time
He also isn‚Äôt an elite shooter. He would play the Kyle Anderson role - doesn‚Äôt seem worth it at 6/7
"Wiggins + 7 pick for Kyle Anderson, Steven Adams, and 10 pick"
"We arent trading Clarke. Its Grayson Allen, Tyrus Jones, or Kyle Anderson."
"It is, but we don‚Äôt have the superstar. We won‚Äôt get one unless we draft one. If we were New York or LA or the nets, we could totally get a star or two to come. We can‚Äôt do that. So it‚Äôs sorta out of order. We also don‚Äôt maximize the guys we get on rookie contracts. We could have traded Kyle Anderson so we got something, but we just let them walk. I‚Äôm fine with doing that, but it sets us back."
"PG: Curry SG: SGA SF: Kyle Anderson PF: Giannis C: Boucher  Bench: Haliburton, TJ McConnell, PJ Tucker, Aron Baynes, Trevor Ariza, Reggie Jackson, Jordan Poole, Maurice Harkless, Chuma Okeke, Willy Hernangomez"
"We have Tyus Jones, and Kyle Anderson can play some point as well. He‚Äôs not crucial. I think we trade him plus the 10th pick plus another first to move up in the draft again. Who knows though."
I think Kyle Anderson is too good to be included in this unless the Kings are giving up a first(which they should not do). But at the same time he's an expiring so idk(I still wouldnt include him though).   Maybe you put in Grayson Allen because he only has 1 yr left on his rookie deal and they might not want to compete with whatever offer sheet someone gives him next summer. I guess same situation as Slo Mo
I was thinking Kyle Anderson? future picks?
Relax bro lol. Maybe Dillon Brooks or Kyle Anderson would be more like it
"Brooks,Kyle Anderson, Clarke, and Bane were all plus defenders. JJJ was good when he wasn‚Äôt hurt. Ja and JV were not good defenders. Jonas, JJJ, and JV foul too much.  JV fouled because he was so poor at defending pnr."
My mad man theory is that Kyle Anderson is going to go to GSW (14 for Anderson + 2022 Utah pick)
How would you feel if you sent Kyle Anderson + the 2022 Utah Pick for pick 14?
"there‚Äôs tremendous value in basically giving 0 minutes to bad players in the regular season. your comment made it seem like sending out JV is going to kill them or something lol. they obviously aren‚Äôt competing right now either  Jaren Jackson and Tillman can easily make up for whatever they‚Äôre losing in JV. if JJJ is healthy he‚Äôll probably be better than JV right away   &gt;	Brooks, Allen, bane, Kyle Anderson, and now bledsoe ‚Äîall of them are best suited coming off the bench.  i don‚Äôt see the point here. they WILL be coming off the bench lol. other than maybe Brooks"
"There are some similarities, but I think they are pretty different players and they shouldn't pass over Giddey because of Kyle Anderson."
"üòí  Cmon bruh. Depends your idea of ‚Äòdeep‚Äô. Having 6 different 6th man/fringe quality players ‚Äî-but a dearth of  actual starting quality players‚Äî-isn‚Äôt  deep to me.   They‚Äôve been using Dillon Brooks like he‚Äôs prime Kobe. Dude is a gunner. 41% from that field and 34% from 3, but is 2nd on the team in Fga‚Äôs (I‚Äôm guessing, bc any time I watch him he‚Äôs inexplicably featured)  Brooks, Allen, bane, Kyle Anderson, and now bledsoe ‚Äîall of them are best suited coming off the bench."
"Josh Giddey is white Ben Simmons, not Kyle Anderson"
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"Definitely. 100%.   The whole American basketball infrastructure is built on the individual. We put a premium on athleticism as opposed to things like IQ, fundamentals, or team play.   It's why a guy like Kyle Anderson will never get commercials or a shoe deal."
Kyle Anderson can accelerate through time
Kyle Anderson can
Good to see Kyle Anderson at the Olympics
"Kyle ""Slow-Mo"" Anderson. Dude cracks me up. Watching him against aggressive defenders is the best. By the time he goes up for the shot, his defender will have attempted a block and be back down on the floor."
"Kyle Anderson, Dwight Howard, TJ McConnell. Let‚Äôs be honest, you don‚Äôt even have to send stars. what other country has the players to match up?"
Kyle Anderson fast break
He gives me the Kyle Anderson vibe haha
"That‚Äôs true. I think he can train doing cuts and curls and get back to the old Klay, if not pretty close. Because he‚Äôs following a predetermined path. Whereas defense involves so much reactive movement. As for not being able to rely on open 3‚Äôs, I think attacking closeouts can also be matter of timing. Joel Embiid has a glacial pump fake but it still works for getting into the paint. Kyle Anderson can get a defender closing out on him into the air and successfully drive to the basket. Klay will need to adapt."
Kyle Anderson is a role player..
I see a BIG year coming for Kyle Anderson.
Kyle Anderson move right there
Brook Lopez looking shifty like Kyle Anderson right there
Is there anyone else who plays like Kyle Anderson but slower?
"Nice try, Draymond, but you gotta be slower than that if you hope to stand a chance against Kyle Anderson üòéüòé"
SlowMo derives from the fact that Kyle Anderson moves so slowly yet smoothly and makes his buckets it's as if he is in slow motion.
"Is Kyle Anderson the smoothest player in the NBA? It's like he's playing in slow motion, but it just works."
kyle anderson moves in slow motion
I actually think it‚Äôs been Kyle Anderson and that‚Äôs backed up by a fair number of advanced metrics.
Kyle Anderson
damn how is Kyle Anderson so slow yet he get space
"Ja, Valanciunas worry me a ton. Kyle Anderson worries me as much as prime Lebron in the 2016 finals"
Kyle Anderson is from another dimension
Everything about Kyle Anderson makes me laugh. The god damn slow motion drive.
I feel like Utah is in need of a crafty PG like rondo or McConnell to lead the second unit or to make better ball movement. Jordan Clarkson carrying the ball for the whole 24 seconds might work for regular season but not playoff playing against Memphis with versatile defenders like Dillion brooks and Kyle Anderson. They are good at intercepting the balls
Be honest. You didn't think Kyle Anderson would ever be part of a team's Big 3 but here we are.
Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson don‚Äôt get talked about enough. Glad to see them get their due credit on this stage.
Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson are single-handedly responsible for clogging the drains in the Grizzlies locker room.
"Kyle ""swiper the fox"" Anderson with 5 steals"
Dillion brooks and Kyle Anderson are playing great

Kyle Anderson the only black guy with deceptive speed.

Ingles vs Kyle Anderson has got to be one of the most fun matchups I can think of.
kyle anderson apparently trying hard to mimic Traes hairstyle.
Kyle Anderson baby!
"In addition to what the others have said, Clarke has been so bad at shooting that it absolutely kills the spacing. And with JJJ back, Kyle Anderson has also been too good as the backup 4 to be taken off the floor."
"Kyle Anderson too, but we're a super young team for the most part. Pels have Adams, Bledsoe, and Johnson."
"**OVERTIME**  Unlikely hero with the deep shots in OT as Grayson Allen hits us with bay to back threes, including one after another out of whack pass by Stephen Curry out of the double team. [The vision of Tillman for the assist in the first one is marvellous, in opposition to the abhorrent transition demesne by the Dubs on the latter one.](https://i.imgur.com/5opZ7T6.mp4)  [Jordan Poole with the clutch shot to put Golden State up 2](https://i.imgur.com/apWIKIO.mp4) and Tillman makes up the miss in regulation on the opposite corner, [with a beautiful feed by the best jumping passer in the NBA](https://i.imgur.com/6eZmCeZ.mp4).   The rough patch continues for Wiggins who missed both jumpers, including a 3-point attempt that doesn‚Äôt even touch the rim. After Poole dribbles off his leg, it‚Äôs up to Ja to clinch the playoff spot. He attacks JTA 1v1, spins inside and [hits the floater - the shot that has served him so well this year - scoring his 35th point in 29 shots, including 5-10 from deep](https://i.imgur.com/2itlkSS.mp4).  Poole [shows up again for a miracle shot and a glimpse of hope](https://i.imgur.com/A6KB3B2.mp4) but there was not enough time to do another comeback.  [Memphis‚Äô defense was the main story](https://i.imgur.com/DgdcXmp.mp4) and I honestly never expected that would have been the case - it‚Äôs what brought them to the position of advantage they enjoyed for most of the game. They had more steals than turnovers! Incredible display on the road with high pressure for such a young team.  Put some respect on Dillon Brooks‚Äô name because these 2 games he‚Äôs been just outstanding defensively, and the support he got inside to avoid cuts to the rim was great as well. Tillman did a fantastic job coming off the bench, especially on defense in the balancing act of covering Draymond Green and making sure to contain Steph enough to give time for Dillon to recover. And Ja Morant made the most of every chance in a way that he didn‚Äôt on the previous game in a great display of control and poise (He even had some great defensive plays, both top-locking Steph himself or bothering people on recoveries). Not to mention the shots by Allen or the masterclass that Kyle Anderson put out there.  For the Warriors, it‚Äôs hard to make any takeaway expect it is impossible to win when turnover over the ball in such a way - and that has to fall on Curry and Green, combining for 13. It seems to an extent that they had all these high intensity games caught up to them but the expectations at this level are cold and ruthless. Like in the Lakers game, they had a TOV% and an Opposition FT Rate both crossing 20%. So once again, they win the half-court battle but are completely destroyed in transition (160 ORTG in transition plays for the Grizzlies this game on CleaningTheGlass. That‚Äôs a lot btw.)  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **NOTES:**  Great adjustment making sure to match Brook‚Äôs minutes as much as they could with Steph after the way he got hot against Melton the previous game.  Not just the terrible lost possessions, but Dray was so much less impactful on defense than he‚Äôs been the last few weeks. Another indication the fatigue caught up to him.  Since the broadcast didn‚Äôt call it out, [just want to give props to Looney for the great seal here](https://i.imgur.com/XmkiyNw.mp4).  The Jordan Poole rise is something I will never understand but something I will always be thankful for. He simply came back from the mid-season G-League bubble as a great player. His decision making is surprisingly good and that was visible in multiple points down the stretch. Honestly, if they wanted to have him out there (and I agree it was the right call), he should have gotten more on-ball plays, getting Curry less times facing a double team and taking the ball out of a cold Andrew Wiggins.  Mulder‚Äôs shot has just not been reliable enough in these games. 1-8 from deep in the Lakers and 2 Grizzlies games.  Kyle Anderson is such a solid 2-way player and such an unconventional entertaining watch. He got a huge amount of responsibilities on help defense this game and [absolutely delivered](https://i.imgur.com/prSALaH.mp4). A very well earned +11 on the night."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors‚Äô execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6‚Äô9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV‚Äôs threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday‚Äôs game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that‚Äôs always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the ‚ÄúCurry experience‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph‚Äôs 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don‚Äôt have Draymond‚Äôs help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV‚Äôs gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can‚Äôt switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).

With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven‚Äôt mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray‚Äôs drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant‚Äôs shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an ‚Äúso wide open its practice‚Äù 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond‚Äôs drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn‚Äôt make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn‚Äôt capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
"The Grizzlies basically play no bad players. The Pelicans play numerous bad players.  The team leader in minutes was one of the worst players in the league  There‚Äôs also ‚Äútalent‚Äù and being good. Lonzo is ‚Äútalented‚Äù, Kyle Anderson is good"
"Can you imagine the criticism that someone like Westbrook (from a few years ago) or especially Harden would get if they missed the playoffs? And had 7 TOs in the elimination game (many of them really bad ones too)? I'm not saying Steph was bad (he wasn't, he was great aside from the TOs) but I just know Harden would get heavily criticized by this whole sub and every media outlet if he had this exact outcome. Almost every other coach would be getting questioned for not being able to free up their star from double teams more too.                           Great performance by the Grizzlies. I was worried about Brooks getting into foul trouble early but it looked like most of the officiating in the first half affected the Grizzlies bigs. I was worried that they would struggle without either Jonas or JJJ but Tillman filled in nicely. Obviously great game from Ja and I think seeing those first few 3s go in really helped set the tone for him for the game. Also Kyle Anderson is one of those players that every team would benefit from having."
"To be fair though, Kyle Anderson played extremely great on defense."

"the one where he expected Bazemore to move into open space after the screen (Memphis 49 GSW 40) is defensible cuz Bazemore is as much to blame cuz that's a regular action they run - basically every other turnover isn't  my favorite player in the league but stupid/careless turnovers are his Achilles heel. and he had some BAD turnovers in terms of WHEN they happened in both games (so did Draymond but his lowlights aren't here), like the Caruso one when they were up 3 with the ball in his hand late in the game.  he's a great passer but point guards also have to take care of the rock, period. a lot of the Warriors' actions when he's getting doubled also have him accepting/welcoming the double team when he's already along the sideline (essentially another defender) so he's at risk for losing the ball out of bounds (Caruso and KYle Anderson got him like that so his tendencies are predictable) or those risky side-to-side cross-court passes where he might throw it too high to avoid a tall defender in his face or the defense reads it and intercepts it like a safety  in a season where i think he did a lot to silence some of his haters, the way it ended in both games also added some more fuel for the detractors"
