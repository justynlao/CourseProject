"Still remember SABO4/5. üò≠ We defo forced him in that catch and shoot role though, can't complain he wasn't as good with us. Also, he was obviously gonna get better with age. I sure would love someone with his playtyle though on the thunder, making our team more matchup-flexible. Hope we can Pick up someone with one of our many picks who's not n3cessarily a project (or pterodactyl) big, but a little more old-school bang around under the basket. Would Luka Garza be someone like that? I haven't followed college ball"
Luka Garza
Hope Houston draft Luka Garza. Then each Texas team can have a Luka.
On guy went to college and then sat out almost his entire rookie year.   Fun fact: Luka Garza is older than Luka Doncic
"Hence why some of the most successful centers in college basketball in recent years end up playing 4 years, and end up *maybe* somewhere in the second round on draft boards at best, and typically end up playing professionally overseas.  Players like Ethan Happ, Isaac Haas, Luka Garza have been crazy dominant in CBB with elite post moves.  But there's really no place for them in the NBA because they're fighting a losing points-per-possession battle on offense."
wait till luka garza

you‚Äôll get Luka Garza and you‚Äôll like it
"Guess I consider myself just a basketball fan, but I follow the nba far more closely than college. Let me tell you something, in my experiences so many college basketball fans are DELUSIONAL. Out here talking about how Luka Garza should be the #1 pick in the draft and how Trayce Jackson-Davis should‚Äôve left college because he would‚Äôve been a lock for a lottery pick. It‚Äôs borderline comical"
Tankathon has Luka Garza at 49. That could be the steal of the draft
Will be surpassed soon cus Luka Garza is actually Clark Kent.
"its the same with luka garza, dominant college player, but will struggle in the nba"
"Some funny notables:   Trae Young #33, Davion Mitchell #63, and Luka Garza at #100"
"He wasn't the best player on Gonzaga though .  The college game is so different than the NBA.  Luka Garza was the Player of the Year and he won't get drafted till the second round lol.  Suggs is a freshman , to expect him to put the team on his back and carry them to a national title is ridiculous"
Not saying that Luka Garza would be better than Wilt at all though he could be a 30+ PPG scorer and still a top player in that era. His defense and athleticism don't match up well to wilt's.   where's your evidence that your average 60's player (any of those other players in that film not named wilt or in HOF) could even make the league rn as a role player?
Say he's named after Luka Garza
"Luka Garza will be eaten alive by pretty much everyone in the nba speed wise and he was probably the best player in college basketball this year. You either need exceptional athleticism or an exceptional skill to be in the nba and a lot of good college players have neither compared to an nba player.   Also if a guy doesn‚Äôt have the ability to become a star (or you are just really sure he doesn‚Äôt), then you are looking to have them fill a certain role whether or be defense, shooting, or cutting. Kinda like how Caruso said that a lot of guys never make it out the g league because they want to do it all when teams are really looking for whoever is best at what they need."
"Luka Garza not even projected to be drafted, that‚Äôs disgusting."
"He‚Äôs good but he has the same problem as Luka Garza (why both are projected so low). People think he‚Äôll be slow and flat footed on defense. However, I actually think both of them should be going higher than what most people project."
"Lol at Luka Garza being the player you mentioned for going to the pros. Not a super athlete and fairly low ceiling (I realize he could be a great pro and this comment could age poorly, though). Might as well have picked Timme. But in all seriousness I mentioned in my post that free/reduced tuition would go a long way to assist in getting folks to accept this situation and make it about the love of the game and a pursuit of a career, not just a ‚Äúfree‚Äù degree."
Most are there to get an education tho and there are alot of D1 hoopers but not at the NBA level and likely never will be like Luka Garza
Watching Jokic this series reminds me of watching Luka Garza in the tourney when Iowa lost to Oregon. Absolute monster with the rest of the team looking like they forgot how to play basketball.
Just say fuck it and bring in the 2nd-3rd generation American imigrants like Luka Garza and Kevin Pangos
Ok but what about luka Garza?
Luka Garza from Iowa?     Yea in the modern NBA he'd get cooked. The reason the B1G in general has no draftees from their conference is that all the best teams had large and slow big men
"Ironically, it was his defense that turned teams off. He was considered too small to guard bigs, and too slow to guard wings. This was back in the day when standard power forwards were like 6‚Äô10‚Äù  A lot of very successful college players end up getting very little draft attention. Like Luka Garza is arguably the best player in college basketball and he‚Äôs probably going to be a late second round pick."
"Davion falls outside the lotto  Kuminga falls past 7th overall  Sengun goes top 14  Wagner goes top 10 (not sure how controversial this is)  Luka Garza gets drafted in the second round  To your take on KP, I could see Bagley/Hield/9th overall being a fair package for him. I've thrown that out there as a savvy move for the Kings. I think that and maxing John Collins would be a big step forward for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/KP/Collins isn't a contender by any means but it's at least going to compete for the playoffs, which is what they need desperately"
"I just did that tonight for this years draft picks. I was going to just raise the top 4 guys up to 80+. Got a bit carried away, Luka Garza is a 99 overall and grew 2 inches."
"Somebody should see if Luka Garza has somehow always been eligible for Slovenian citizenship and wouldn‚Äôt count as a naturalised player. Maybe he‚Äôs actually his uncle Teoman‚Äôs illegitimate son, sent to America as an infant to live with dad‚Äôs sister and avoid scandal."
"Take Luka Garza.   He would have earned so much money the past 4 years at Iowa, yet he's barely a second round pick."
Luka Garza
"They should throw a college kid or 2 in there like the old days, for when they go up like 124-58 on Angola.  Get Luka Garza and Jared Butler on the team"
"I mean, Luka Garza just won the Naismith. The post game is alive and well at the college level, though it's true it's a lot less emphasized for dudes who have the athleticism to play with their face to the basket"
And that‚Äôs why we are drafting Luka Garza.
Luka Garza
Luka Garza is the most decorated college player that everyone hates as a pro prospect lol
What if they draft Luka Garza at 1
It's actually about Iowa Hawkeye legend Luka Garza
"Sekou is not a good NBA player. He's been given opportunities and he just almost always stinks the gym up with his play. Which isn't to say that he can't be good, but we already have his one in a thousand best case scenario in Jerami Grant. I've watched Sekou a lot including up close and personal in the G-League and I really don't think it's gonna happen for him. I'd rather keep him over Okafor, but I can also understand the desire for having a third string center if Luka Garza truly isn't ready to play any NBA minutes yet.  Also, our new FO is amazing so you don't know what you're talking about there."
"Well it‚Äôs an nba one now:  Luka Garza is the reason I work out.  I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Pistons Fall Camp. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I loved him in the 2021 Summer League and that his soft and supple hands are the best in the country. He laughs. I get my drink. ""Well, see ya,"" I say and walk away. I've got his attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Luka Garza? He touches his neck as he watches me leave. Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette. ""Got a spare?"" he asks. ""What's in it for me?"" I say as I hand him one of my little white ladies. he smiles. ""Conversation with me, duh."" I laugh. ""What's so funny?"" he protests. ""Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the fame?"" ""You get used to it,"" he says, lighting his cigarette and handing me back the lighter. ""What would you do if you weren't an elbow magnet basketball player?"" I ask. ""Teaching, I think."" ""And if I was your student, what would I be learning?"" ""Discipline,"" he says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. ""Where are you from?"" ""Bermuda,"" I say. ""Oh wow. That's lovely."" ""It's ok,"" I admit. ""Not everything is to my liking."" ""What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?"" he inquires. ""I don't like sand,"" I tell him. ""It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."""
Luka Garza plays just like old dirk thats funny
Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Garza
This was really fun to record - I‚Äôd normally never post this podcast on r/nba (it‚Äôs almost always exclusively pistons content) but what a fascinating listen.   Mr. Garza also boldly predicts that Luka will be the first big to shoot over 50% from three - i did a double take when i heard him say that but why not aim high right?
that‚Äôs a fun way to spell Luka Garza
Hype ended with Cade Cunningham.  Now Luka Garza is the savior of the Pistons!
"Luka Garza hasn't played a game yet, relax a bit."
"Damn, Luka Garza was only the 52nd. We'll have to settle for two MVPs :("
"Hey you wanna make this a white guy thing, he also reminds me of Caleb Swanigan and Daniel Oturu but slower and worse at blocking shots.  Thants who Luka Garza is more likely to compare to in the NBA in terms of being basically just a guy."
Looking at Garza in summer league shows what a huge mistake some teams made in not taking a second round flier on Luka. He could absolutely contribute for teams with rest day superstar (and salary cramped max contracts). If his defense remains good enough to not be an automatic bucket for opposing offenses he‚Äôs already proven he can hang with non starter nba defense.
"Luka lacks the passing to be jokic, the playmaking and shooting of the other Luka, and steph is such an absurd person to compare to it‚Äôs not worth discussing. And his strengths that those guys lack don‚Äôt come close to matching the ones he does. And I‚Äôm a massive Garza homer.  That said his summer league has me hyped that he could be more than a fringe player. And if nba strength training miraculously improved his speed/quickness a borderline starter. But that‚Äôs his absolute best scenario. That said I have no doubt he‚Äôs going to have a long career contributing to teams that know how to use him."
Cant wait for the debates..  *Are we sure Doncic is the best Luka?*  *Yeah fam.. Garza be ballin*  *Nah nah.. Im talkin bout Samanic*
"Luka Garza is the reason I work out.  I have this fantasy where we start talking at Fry Fest. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I loved him in January 2020. He laughs.

Luka Garza is putting on a show so that‚Äôs something to watch
"I think Garza had to play softer defense than he was capable of because of Iowa‚Äôs coaching philosophy. He automatically benched players with two fouls in the first half, and we needed Luka on the court at all times. Add in that he won‚Äôt be playing 30+ minutes a game and I‚Äôm not shocked his defense already looks better."
Luka Garza is the reason I work out.
Because Luka Garza exists.

Luka Garza was the steal of the draft
Luka Garza -------------
"it's kind a funny misunderstanding due to the establishment of a new name. Look at the other comments here. ""He"" ""him"" ""this dude"" etc. Since Garza is the established topic of conversation, mentioning him by name is redundant and confused OP into thinking the commenter must've meant a different Luka."

This is literally a Garza thread no one should have to clarify which Luka they‚Äôre talking about lol
Luka Garza
"Luka Garza, I don't think teaching defense to a big like him is anywhere near as hard as teaching someone like Ben Simmons how to shoot."
Luka Garza
Luka Garza
"Luka Garza. Will be a starter, and allstar. Every negative about him is just based on assumption."
I was behind Luka Garza at a Pancheros in Iowa City a couple months back and he got a ton of free food and didn't say thanks or acknowledge the workers at all and then I got charged 50 cents for sour cream when I went through next.
"Bol Bol, Mo Bamba. I think they could both break out if they would get actual minutes somewhere. Their current teams (DEN/ORL) aren't playing them at all.   Luka Garza could join the conversation of guys like Draymond, Manu, and Jokic in terms of most successful 2nd round pick, IMO. He can score like very few others I've seen and if his defense can become even just a slight negative instead of just a black hole, that's better."
Luka Garza
"Damn... Honest mistake, my bad :d  It would be better if he wrote Garza or sth... Cause sorry, there is only one Luka if u get me"
"I was talking about the 22 year olds I named as ‚Äògood for an 8th man scoring center, but not athletic enough for NBA rim protection.‚Äô WCS could have easily been a rim protector, but isn‚Äôt trusted to do anything other than stand in the dunker spot on offense.   I included Bagley and WCS as guys who were dominant in college but weren‚Äôt effective in the NBA, obviously WCS has found a different way of not being effective than Kaminsky or Olynyk. Luka Garza probably isn‚Äôt taking any lessons from WCS‚Äôs NBA career."
"God I can‚Äôt stand Luka Garza. He‚Äôs such a stupid arrogant asshole. I just get so frustrated every time I see his stupid manly jawline, and dumb perfect body, and idiotic beautiful eyebrows.  Seeing him run around on the court and hit these ridiculous threes and dunks, and coming down with all these absurd boards, I just get so angry that it makes blood rush to my penis and it gets little bit hard from sheer rage. I just wish I was out on the court so I could run up to him and foul the shit out of him as hard as I can, and rip his jersey off and look directly into his stupid, beautiful face as I rub my crotch on his muscular leg. I‚Äôd get as close to his face as I could and whisper in his ear softly ‚ÄúI got you, you fucker. You‚Äôre not as good as you think you are.‚Äù  Then for good measure I would put my lips on his face so that I could taste his fear and I would smell his hair so that I knew what it was like to dominate Luka Garza. Oh how I want that. I think about it at night sometimes when I am in bed with my girlfriend. I just want to know what it‚Äôs like to be on top of Luka Garza like that.  Stupid, beautiful Luka Garza, I just hate him so much."
"Man, I was a big time Luka Garza hater throughout college, as a major fan of his in-state rival school.  But even in coming around to seeing that this guy is going to be pretty useful at the next level‚Ä¶"

"Whoa, slow down. We're talking about the same draft that has Luka ""5 blocks"" Garza."
Surprised MJ didn‚Äôt get Luka Garza

Why stop at 2018? Luka Garza checks all those boxes this year
"Can't believe Cam Thomas fell as far as he did. Sure he has his flaws, I'm not saying he'll be amazing (especially not right off the bat) but his college profile makes it real hard to believe he fell that much (from someone who does not follow college much).   The dude averaged 23 as a Freshman in the SEC for a 19-10 team. Legit 4th highest scorer in all of D1 basketball and 2nd out of any player in any major conference (only to Luka Garza). Only other freshman in the top 20 was Cade Cunningham (who just made the cut at #20). Those 3 names plus Scotty Pippen Jr from Vanderbilt (#16) are the only P5 conference players in the top 20 in scoring in the nation.   I know plenty of dudes can get buckets in college which dont translate to the NBA and I'm not saying he should have been a top 10 pick. But to put up the kind of numbers he did, playing the competition he was playing, contributing to winning the way he did, while only being a freshman, you'd think he'd be on more teams radars in the late lotto to the teens yet he lasted to 27.   Not complaining at all. He's in a place where he can take his time to develop without much pressure, learning from guys like Kyrie/Harden and a coach like Nash. Excited to see what he can do for us!"
And he was just guarded by Luka Garza and Tyler Cook.  He will not be facing poor defenders like that in the NBA on a nightly basis.
"I mean, let's pump the brakes a little bit - Sengun went against defensive juggernauts Sekou Doumbouya and Luka Garza last night, after besting the terrible twosome of Banks and Kabengele on Sunday.  Granted, he has looked very good. But let's wait and see how it plays out in the regular season with guys that are actually pro-ready centers."
No knock on Sengun...but keep in mind he was being guarded by Luka Garza (who can't guard a turtle) and Tyler Cook (who is undersized and not a capable NBA defender).  I would have loved to see Sengun guarded by Isaiah Stewart.
"Sengun is a beast, but the best big on the pistons summer league team is literally Luka Garza."
Luka Garza is probably one of the most polished bigs to come out the NCAA in recent years. Lot of bigs just get drafted based on potential. Kinda excited to see how his career turns out.
Luka Garza would kill to be 1/20th of the defender Kristaps is.
Luka Garza
"I know everyone is hyped, and Sengun was awesome, but anointing him a star after two summer league games is an overreaction. Luka Garza is a godawful post defender."
Shout out Luka Garza
 Tyler Cook and Luka Garza blew like three layups combined each. You can't always go off assists because Cade was dropping some dimes his teammates just weren't converting.
Luka Garza forces a lot of fouls on him
Luka Garza moves like an offensive lineman on a sweep looking for someone to block.
When all is said and done Luka Garza will be a top 5 player from this draft class.      Luka Garza is what Kristaps think he is and then some.     Dallas should have just taken him at 36th and traed Kovid Kristaps for whatever they could get
Lost in the Cade vs Green storyline is the Garza vs Senguin battle!  Garza out there showung he is the better skilled offensive force of fundamentals and footwork (but not great on defense).  Luka is offended by Senguin taking all the hype.
Luka Garza making fools outta these guys

Only four years away from the Luka Garza/Josh Christopher showdown.
"Medicore centers are only worth vet mins, playable centers are worth more than a vet min (although not much more)  Also Luka Garza barely got drafted and the jury is absolutely out on whether or not he'll last in the league (I imagine if he does it'll be for vet min contracts). Dude will get blitzed in the PNR like Kanter."
Jericho Sims is a second round pick. Luka Garza is a second round pick.  You can absolutely find replacement level bigs in the second round. Paying mediocre centers is not the move.
So is Luka Garza gonna tear the league up as well
In this picture he looks almost as tall as luka garza. Let's stop talking about his height now
He was outplayed by Luka Garza. Complete bust.
"Instructions unclear, watched Luka Garza"

All this just to lose to Cade Cunningham and Luka Garza

Hey you shut up about future league mvp and star Pistons‚Äô center; Luka Garza.
Had an open gym already ready for every possible pick at #4. I want to see the Luka Garza one
"and more than half of those players are going to play in the G League next season. Along with some of the guys drafted from the NCAA the year before that and the year before that. The G League will include guys like Markus Howard, Luka Garza, etc. who were towards the top of NCAA basketball.   There's more media pressure and environments, but definitely not more top level talent. Half the teams that guys play have like one player good enough to even make it to the G League the next season."
"Luka Garza, Wooden Award winner last season"
Garza. Maybe he will take the better than the other Luka?
Dude hasnt even guarded Luka Garza yet and he already knows what's up. Respect.
Yeah Luka Garza is a beast!
"I think you need to consider the possibility that body fat % looks different on a huge frame than on a person with average height / width.   These are the results from this year‚Äôs combine: https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/  Almost everyone is in the 4-8% range, aside from guys who look chubby by NBA standards like Luka Garza. If we‚Äôre going to selectively decide this info is invalid, then why do we trust the wingspan, vertical, speed, etc?   I trust the experts that take these measurements more than any redditor‚Äôs eye test. Particularly since any of us are comparing to normal size adult males and have no reference for what body fat% a 7‚Äô3‚Äù guy who appeared as ripped as a competition body builder would be."
"&gt; he slow as hell but i think he can make it in the league  Someone call Jokic and let him know he might be able to make it in the league.  Everyone is legitimately sleeping on Luka Garza because of his speed.  College stats and splits.  24.1/8.7/1.7/0.7  55.3/70.9/44.0  Summer League  15/9.6 in 21mpg and had a 21/15 game vs Orlando in 27 minutes.  He had a 10/12/5 block game.  He had a 20/14 in 26 minutes.  He shot 52, 40 from 3 and 79 at the line."

He lit up Luka Garza for a bit (and also got lit up by Luka Garza).
"You joke, but Pistons fans have been doing that with Luka Garza."
"As someone who routinely does this, don‚Äôt care I‚Äôll probably still do it in the future. Luka Garza hall of famer inbound"
Can't wait for them to throw in Luka Garza as trade fluff.
Luka Garza
"I don't know, but I think this is something that is extremely hard to predict especially since college players are getting drafted based on their potential as opposed to how they played in College. Luka Garza for example was one of the best players in College and barely got drafted in the 2nd round of the draft.  If you're looking to do research on this, I'd recommend looking back at the data in the 80s and 90s when players were actually staying in College for 3-4 years and were getting drafted based on their play in college instead of just their potential."
Luka Garza
I'd say swap plumbee with Luka Garza.  Not explosive but super skilled post big with range.  Much more of a  jokic lite than plumlee
Just proves that being NCAA player of the year doesn't prove everything. That was everybody's point when talking about Luka Garza.
What do you think will happen with Luka Garza? He averaged 24/8 on 62 TS% in his senior year.
"Luka Garza, I thought maybe David lee type career without the dunks"
Luka Garza swims with the fishes
Luka Garza is now forgiven üôèüèΩ
"Ok, he hasn't played all that well so I can't even let this sit that high on here untouched. He got outplayed by Luka Garza in junk minutes last night and it was pretty sad."
"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant. We will be exciting at times, but mostly sucktastic, until we get more players to space the floor."
"Damn I knew I should‚Äôve picked a more storied franchise when deciding which team to root for growing up. That way I could get your approval.  Y‚Äôall love talking history cause your future ain‚Äôt bright lol. Last 10 years, what have the pistons done? Prob like 2 playoff appearances and a .300 win percentage.   Looking at the future is even more depressing. Who y‚Äôall even hyped for? Luka Garza?"
Luka Garza? 3 team trade it is
Garza is the best Luka in the league
Now that we have Luka Garza it will be very common to see other team's stars not show up to our games out of fear. I don't blame them.
Yay so excited to watch Embiid anally abuse our g leaguers  Embiid vs Luka Garza: *whos the true basketball savant?*
"Luka GARZA, not Hayes"
Luka Doncic   Luca Vildoza   Luke-a Kennard  Luka Samanic   Luka Garza  &amp;#x200B;  Coach: Luke-a Walton
Luca Vildoza is also available (waived by Knicks). Maybe they can also get Luka Garza from Pistons to compensate for the lost years
Evan Mobley or Luka Garza. Who would you rather have for the next 8 years?
Luka Garza- trade a player who can score great but is awful on defense for a player who can't shoot but is brilliant on defense.
Luka Garza will end up being an incredible player. Total steal for the Pistons
Mavericks will regret not drafting Luka Garza as a Porzingis replacement
I wouldn't put too much stock into the accuracy of these for now. These speed and vertical measurables would be either the worst or among the worst in the combine last year. No way does he have the speed and vertical of Luka Garza. And hands that small? He wouldn't be able to palm the ball.
Slower 3/4 court sprint than Luka Garza who was the slowest in [2021 draft combine](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-strength-agility/?sort=THREE_QUARTER_SPRINT&amp;dir=1)
Luka Garza uwu
"You dummy, you forgot the GOAT Luka  &gt;!Garza!&lt;"
Luka Garza?
"I definitely think he‚Äôd slim down.   Like look at Luka Garza for example, he went up to 280 to deal with the physical college centers, and right before he got drafted he lost 30-40 pounds to be more agile to fit in this league"
You‚Äôre just cherry picking in my opinion. Luka Garza went to a white as hell school and was arguably the best player in college basketball. Why is it weird that he would also have people rooting for him?   You are mad at your teams fellow fans for getting excited that a rookie is touching the ball?  Come to the Nets subreddit and look at how we react when Cam Thomas gets minutes
"I've never really seen the Kenyon Martin love you're alluding to, but the Luka Garza love happened immediately in our teams sub. You can also hear how excited the (mostly white) fans get whenever Garza touches the ball. He's already a fan favorite. I'm not saying it's entirely a skin color thing, I'm just saying it definitely seems to be a part of the equation at times."
"I think there's a certain amount of truth to that. A lot of fans don't want to admit to themselves that they sometimes cheer more for the white guy, even when it doesn't make sense. For instance, our sub LOVES Luka Garza. Never seen a pick in the 50s who can't play defense get showered with so much love so quickly lmao.  But in this case, I think it has more to do with the history of the Morris twins, and the fact that Markief clearly instigated the shoving match.  Also remember, everybody hated on Grayson Allen for his dirty stuff too, and Kelly Olynyk. Like I said, I don't think you're coming out of left field with your assessment, but it's definitely not a constant either."
"If Trae was half as good as Luka Garza I'd be cool with it, if theres another Luka in the league Im sure Trae is better than them"
Luka Garza is the reason I workout
"Unfortunately thats super unlikely to happen, undersized hustle guys like him just don't last in the league, *especially* ones that can't shoot either. The only reason he even gets any minutes is because the Pistons drafted him so it would be dumb not to give him a chance, plus his competition for minutes is fucking Kelly Olynyk and some dude named Luka Garza.   Doubt he lasts beyond his rookie contract unless he **majorly** develops or settles for minimum type contracts and because an end of the bench guy that only plays when the starting C is injured.   It's unfortunate but on the bright side, if he's smart at all with his money, which is doubtful given how he has severe anger management issues and is clearly incredibly emotional, he should be able to live the rest of his life off of his rookie contract earnings."
I am genuinely sorry you couldn't get a free one today. Please message Luka Garza &amp; he will venmo you the cost of one.
"I‚Äôm not blinded from anything, I might be the least biased fan out there. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs baby Ben Wallace or Bam or anything. But by all defensive metrics he‚Äôs a pretty damn good defender and is an overall positive on the floor. Nobody even really hypes him up that much which is why it‚Äôs surprising u even chose him. Everyone just likes his energy and knows he has his limitations. Luka Garza, for example, is trash"
Him and Luka Garza rockin scars in Staples. Badasses
Georges Niang. And I think Luka ‚ÄúTall Georges Niang‚Äù Garza will succeed as well.
Luka Garza &gt; Bam Adebayo sorry man I don‚Äôt make the rules
Luka Garza is starting an NBA game. Lord have mercy
I agree that Luka Garza is no MVP candidate.
"/r/nba is filled with:  * ""Poku 9 pts, 3 rebounds FULL HIGHLIGHTS"" * ""Josh Giddey 11 pts, 4 rebounds 3 assists Highlights"" * ""Luka Garza just put up 15 pts (6-10 shooting) today in SL""  Like these are fine players (Giddey more than the others) but damn, they get worshiped for pretty mundane statlines, compared to other players... wonder why."
"Luka ""Got murdered by Jarrett Allen"" Garza Footspeed of a turtle. Yeah poised to be a ""sUpERsTar"""
"Luka Garza  Everyone in the Pistons org won't shut up about his work ethic whenever he is brought up and I think that will show in his game. He wants to prove all the critics wrong, he wants to be successful in the NBA. The dude dropped 30 pounds before the draft and I think another season or 2 with the same attitude and we will be seeing a jacked Garza ready to own the post."
Luka Garza is the best Luka in the league
Every big on the roster just got injured except for Luka Garza so ‚Ä¶ we definitely are the worst in the NBA now
"More impressive considering at one point in this game, he was out there with Luka Garza, Frank Jackson, Trey Lyles, and Josh Jackson. None of those guys should be in a 9 man NBA rotation."
"Not to the same extent. There are still a lot of majority white teams in D1, especially at smaller schools. And I have no data to back this up, but I feel like there are more prominent white players in college than the NBA.   Like generally some of the top college players in the country will be white juniors and seniors who end up getting drafted but not making as much of a splash in the NBA. Think Frank Kaminsky, Doug McDermott, Tyler Hansbrough, Luka Garza.   Almost all the white All-Stars in the NBA are European. Whereas you have plenty of white American superstars in other sports. Tom Brady, Mike Trout, etc"
"Luka Garza has been pretty good for a 50's level pick.  He seems as capable as any other 12th - 15th man, just with lots of upside and room to grow as a player.  Picks this low wash out probably 50% of the time and never see a day in the NBA, so getting a bench player with high upside and great work ethic is a win."
"I just watched Luka Garza play minutes for them, Bagley is worth a flier"
Luka Garza swims with the fishes... again.
"Olynyk is out for 6 weeks  They just have BeefStew and Luka Garza, who probably shouldn't be getting meaningful minutes, at C."
More like 50-something draft pick Luka Garza.
Someday we will use Luka and everyone will understand we mean Garza
He's right. Luka Garza ain't that clutch at the moment
Lol from the title I thought it was Luka Garza
luka garza is
"Nice list OP!  While not current NBA players, I found this interesting.  Only 10 players in the NBA played in high school in Maine.  All 10 were from the same high school, Maine Central Institute.  Sam Cassell, Caron Butler, Cutino Mobley, and Brad Miller came from that high school.  Since others asked, here's current players who played high school ball in D.C. (in alphabetical order):  Saddiq Bey  Luka Garza  Josh Hart  Jamorko Pickett"
He's a poor man's Luka Garza.
False it would‚Äôve been Luka Garza
This *will be* the case for my boy Luka Garza (if he is to remain in the league at any length).
Late as but you guys ended up getting Luka Garza who was an offensive beast so getting a pick in the 50s has worked out i reckon
Luka Garza easy
"BOI, I LOVE THIS DRAFT, I'M GONNA NUT.   CADE IS OUR ATARTING GUARD.   ISIAH LIVERS IS OUR BACKUP WING; GREAT VISION AND UNDERRATED ATHLETICISM, JUST NEEDS TO HEAL.   LUKA GARZA IS THE PERFECT BACKUP FOR ISAIAH STEWART. AN ALL DEFENSE DUDE IN STEWART WITH AN ALL OFFENSE DUDE IN GARZA.   I'M FINNA NUT."
"Hey man, Garza can be a big time energy player. No he won‚Äôt match his NCAA numbers,  but I wouldn‚Äôt count him out. Luka loves the doubters and he‚Äôs gonna get even better"
"Luka Garza is going to have a really solid rookie season and prove a lot of people wrong. I wasn‚Äôt too high on him, but if Troy Weaver picked him he has to be good."
Lmao Garza picked like 20 picks too lower than he shoulda have been. Luka Garza is 100% an upgrade over Kovid Kristaps
I just realized how the fuck did Wiezkamp go before Luka Garza
That‚Äôs fire lmao Luka Garza and Cade lol
Luka Garza is a steal
You think Luka Garza has a chance of being drafted over BJ  Boston? Lol
Is Luka Garza gonna get drafted?
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs absurd. He averaged less than 10 points at Nebraska and Luka Garza is still on the board. I get not every player is built for the NBA but that‚Äôs crazy to me
Someone pick Luka Garza!!!
Luka Garza is better than Kristaps so Mavs should pick him and trade KP for whatever they can to ensure 2022 isn't Lukas last season as a Maverick
Don‚Äôt forget Luka Garza and Mamu!
Where is Luka Garza?
at this rate we‚Äôre gonna see Luka Garza go lotto lmao
"Nah, nothing is worse than the Colangelo era, the pre-Masai Raptors would've continued to waste Bosh's prime and picked Luka Garza here lmao"
oh my brain was on wrong Luka. Still think Suggs was better than Garza last year
I'll take one Luka Garza thanks very much
Who is stopping this potential jumbo-sized Wizards lineup:  Ben Simmons   Kuzma   Trez  Luka Garza   Gafford
There will be at least 10 people on Twitter tonight confused about Luka Garza not being picked first
Luka Garza may be a good 2nd round pick üëÄ
Luka Garza with 39? a bit too high.
1 Cade   2 Jalen Green    3 Davion Mitchell    4 Luka Garza    5 Jalen Suggs    6 Trey Murphy    7 James Bouknight    8 Jared Butler    9 Alpren Segun    10 Keon Johnson
Think Luka Garza is drafted? Could fill a backup big role
Star: Suggs  Bust: Michelle  Steal: is Luka Garza really gunna go undrafted?
now leak where Doncic‚Äôs future allstar big man teammate Luka Garza will land Woj      the more pressing questions
"Having done almost no actual research since the Celtics don't have any first rounders...  Star: Cade, Mobley, and Green obviously. I like all three guys. If I want to pick maybe a non-star but a guy with a really good long career, I think Franz Wagner is going to be an excellent jack-of-all-trades player that every contender will want.  Bust: Not a full *bust*, but James Bouknight seems like more of a floor-raiser than a ceiling-raiser. Not a big fan of streaky score-first guards with mediocre passing instincts and poor defense. Those players always seem to get way less useful the second the playoffs start.  Steal: Is it weird I kind of still like Luka Garza? 95% of me knows that a slow center with poor defense just isn't cut out for the league, but he was just so dominant in college that I can talk myself into taking a chance on him in the 2nd round. He barely even needs to focus on training his basketball skills, just 100% on athleticism."
Star: Davion Mitchell    Bust: Kuminga     Steal: Luka Garza
"Star: Jalen Green  Bust: Cade Cunningham  Steal: BJ Boston, Luka Garza"
They should draft Luka Garza #5 Center in the draft with efficient scoring. Projected to be a 2nd round pick.
Luka Garza to Philly CONFIRMED
Luka Garza yes
Luka Garza
"Can someone explain Luka Garza to me? I don‚Äôt watch a lot of college ball, but he was one of the best college players last season. Why isn‚Äôt he even on anyone‚Äôs top 50?"
Iowa legend Luka Garza**
Luka Garza?    Yea i could see that
really disappointed they aren‚Äôt picking BPA and going for Luka Garza
"Yes, of course. Luka Garza."
Luka Garza? Doncic isn't American. Giannis would be Greece.
Luka Garza will be a 4x NBA champion.
Hotter take: Luka Garza plays 17 years in the NBA
Luka Garza plays 16 years in the nba.
So a smaller Luka Garza?
If Luka Garza was doing that as a freshman he would be a first round prospect but because he‚Äôs 22 &amp; projects to struggle on D he‚Äôs a late 2nd round pick or will go undrafted.
"This is all a smoke screen, they‚Äôre taking Luka Garza first"
