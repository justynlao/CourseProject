"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
And Romeo Langford.
"They got Romeo Langford who has a significantly higher upside than Brandon Clarke. And trading out of pick 20 got them Williams and Edwards; so far Clarke is better, but he's 24, has taken a step back this year and we'll see how Grant+Edwards develop. Too early to get overly excited about anyone in the second round last year.  We're still looking at 500-1000 minutes of their entire career across two really bizarre seasons so far for most of these guys."
I really really like Romeo Langford and Javonte Green also. Semi less so but he’s a fine 3 and D option.
"Rob is good Theis isn’t a bench player he’s a starter. Our bench consists of Teague, Semi, Nesmith, Grant, Rob, Green, Edwards, Romeo and PP.  I like PP he’s already a good bench piece. Langford is alright but still that is not anywhere close to a good bench. That TPE is necessary or a very good bench piece."
Where's Romeo Langford been? He's the only time I get to bust out the Romeo Show theme song for :(
"Boston needs bench depth, but Wings... as crazy as that sounds. last year we had Brown, Tatum, Hayward so there was no reason to get a wing because 1 of them was always on the floor and most of the time 2 of them were out there. Without Hayward this year on the wing we have Jaylen and Jayson. after that the depth is really: Javonte Green, Semi Ojeleye, Romeo Langford (injured), Aaron Neismith. the back up ball handlers are Teague, Pritchard, Edwards and Waters. IT was one of my favorite players, but we couldn’t really use any point guard help right now unless we move some guys."
Lmao  Does Brad Stevens hate Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith
All you lost was romeo Langford.
"Meh. I don’t put much stock into those top freshman heavy pre season mock drafts judging strictly off HS tape. Romeo Langford, nas little, Quentin grimes were also sure fire top 10 picks pre season."
Romeo Langford
Romeo Langford. His shot is broken. His shooting form is hideous.
"&gt; missing so many key players  ""So many""? You mean Tatum? Or are we counting Robert Williams, Carsen Edwards and Romeo Langford as ""key players""?"
Romeo Langford has entered the chat
"Or ROMEO ""SHAKE MILTON STOPPER"" LANGFORD."
I feel like Nesmith is on a very tight leash. Do you have any ideas why? I wonder if Romeo Langford will be the same way when he returns (but I'll be the first to tell you I'm not high on him at all - watched him since IU)
"They really do, but I'll be the first to admit that I've never been impressed with Romeo at all and I watched him at IU.  He's been banged up ever since he's been in the NBA and he has a broken shot form. Boston fans will tell you he's a plus defender but Boston's entire bench is 1-way defensive players (Langford, Grant Williams, Ojelye) and their offense tanks when either Tatum or Brown aren't in the rotation.  Hindsight's 20/20, but if they have their star wings already drafted they should've went for some high-floor, low-ceiling complimentary options in the draft like Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane."
"The last four first-rounders you guys selected with those ""valuable"" draft picks are Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard. Come on, dude."
"Cuz I’m pissed that Houston didn’t take The Celtics deal of Carsen Edwards, Romeo Langford and a 2nd round pick"
"They're not extra picks, but the pick swap that the Celtics got from the Nets in the Pierce/Garnett trade turned into Jayson Tatum (and Romeo Langford), so they're definitely valuable assets still."
"Celtics aren’t gonna make a move until the deadline. We need to see what Kemba looks like and if Romeo Langford can contribute. If we did though, most of our sub wants Harrison Barnes"
"Didn’t you guys draft Bennet #1? Wasn’t Markelle taken #1 Tatum’s year? Idk but it seems to me like hitting on high picks isn’t a given. Also, Semi is having an incredible season and most think he should be starting at PF. Robert Williams is currently averaging 15 ppg, 3.3 blocks, 2 steals, 1.4 assists, and 15 rebounds per 36 minutes. He’s playing 16 a night. Grant Williams is a solid bench player who can spread the floor and play dominant on the defensive end. Romeo Langford hasn’t played enough to have opinions on however when he does play he’s a defensive menace with great interior offense. Making an opinion on Nesmith after he’s only played 15 minutes in the NBA is absolutely stupid. Especially for a guy like Nesmith who got injured in college and hasn’t played basketball in over a year. I feel like you’re pulling takes out of nowhere. It just sound immature.  Delete this nephew."
"Horford to Toronto is pretty interesting. I don’t think we’re in the running for Hill. Payton Pritchard has turned out to be a really good bench PG, especially for a rookie and Brad Stevens trusts Jeff Teague with reckless abandon. Plus, we still have our tiny toons guards.  We need another wing to be honest. Semi Ojeleye has actually been very good this season so far but after him and the Jays, it’s pretty barren. Javonte Green is an exciting deep bench guy but he shouldn’t be getting many minutes, we don’t know if Romeo Langford will be able to stay healthy and Nesmith just isn’t ready to contribute yet (he looks fine, just needs to be in the nba system to catch up to the game).  Plus, Danny ainge almost NEVER makes roster adjustments mid-season outside of 10-day contracts."
"I agree. Plus we have so many young players. It makes sense to just wait and see this season. Plus Romeo Langford and nesmith are still due to eventually become contributors. I think by seasons end some of these young guys can become actual trade chips, instead of just throw ins. Plus we can use the TPE to make a big trade in the offseason.   Plus trading for harden doesn’t make us contenders this year anyways and then he’d be on his last year of his deal, with no guarantee of him resigning. Even if we made the finals with harden I don’t think that’s enough to beat the lakers.   Like you said it just doesn’t make sense for us. This time next year if we are lucky and young guys pan out, we might be contenders without having to sacrifice one of our young main guys.   Realistically there are not many players I’m trading Jaylen or Jayson for. I think their talent, age, personalities, and most importantly their desire to be here long term makes them almost impossible to trade."
"so much this.  OP has the Celtics using a protection slot on Tristan Thompson over Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford, 2 late lottery/mid-first picks from the last 2 years.  There is no chance in hell the Celtics would protect Thompson, who is about to be 30 and on a MLE contract over 2 21 year-olds on rookie scale deals."
"there is absolutely zero chance the Celtics would protect Tristan Thompson over Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford.  TT is about to be 30 and is on the MLE, Nesmith/Langford are 21 and on rookie scale deals for multiple seasons."
"Players out due to Covid-19 protocols for BOS: Tatum, Grant Williams, Robert Williams, Tristan Thompson  Players out due to injury for BOS: Kemba, Romeo Langford  This is gonna be so great....."
Great picks for certain. But there are also these guys named Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith. At some point he needs to do a better job putting talent around the J Team.
"Man somehow this guy plays more than Javonte Green, Carden Edwards, Romeo Langford etc. but gotta admit he’s been ballin"
This is the first time I’ve seen Romeo Langford mentioned since he was drafted. Kind of forgot about his existence lmao
Celtics  1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Peyton Pritchard 5. Robert Williams 6. Aaron Nesmith 7. Romeo Langford
"Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, Pritchard, Rob Williams, Grant Williams/Romeo Langford."
"Yeah if the Cs want to get serious there are 3 or 4 young players who need a few more years of development to really begin producing, but also some guys we need to dump off to try and acquire more vets. I think both Williams and Pritchard are the ones worth hanging onto, along with maybe Waters. Ojeleye and Langford should be part of a package tbh, Semi is at his ceiling and Romeo is a project for a rebuilding team to gamble on, he cannot seem to stay healthy. Edwards may not have a role on any team tbh."
"Trade for Harden probably.   But they need to use that TPE and get some nice complimentary pieces; a lot of players from the Magic could work (i.e. Gordon, Fournier, Ross) or even Harrison Barnes.   The bench is too raw but they need at least one of those guys between Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford to break out. None are great shooters at the moment.  They'll probably continue to be a perennial second round exit though until Tatum/Brown become the next Jordan/Pippen."
"Celtics would trade a big, a first rounders or two, and romeo Langford for DD. Do the spurs accept?"
"How about if the Celtics offer the Rockets Robert &amp; Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards &amp; 4 seconds? Who says no?"
That’s the same dude who thinks Romeo Langford is a future superstar. We’re not all like that
Romeo Langford
"The Jazz haven’t proved anything, Clippers choked because they were iso ball, Blazers haven’t got anywhere but a WCF and aren’t looking like they will win anytime soon, and the Bucks have consistently disappointed. Yes the current Celtics are the greatest team of all time, but I would still consider Romeo Langford a good passer."
"Fair enough, I’m just trying to find a player that is currently in the top 4 or so to compare Luka to. Luka like Bird is a good midrange scorer with vision, Bball IQ, making the right play, is not the most athletic but no slouch, and hits those same crazy turn around jumpers Bird was known for. I think Jokic is **much** more like Bird in play style (but definitely not on the same level defensively).  Luka probably ends up as a worse Romeo Langford."
Romeo Langford is going to be an all-star.
"I love JB. He is an amazing offensive player and he is an all star for that very reason. But watching him on defense can be soooo frustrating. Like, it’s obvious he has the physical gifts to be a great defender and he has shown it from previous years all the way to that block at the end. I’m not sure if it’s scheme or low defensive IQ but they got like 6 wide open threes from it. He just falls asleep. I really hope he fixes it.   On a positive note tho, Romeo Langford looked great. Really good defense and the offensive rebounding was a pleasant surprise. I didn’t expect him to play this much right off the start but he is really showing he deserves it.  Also, RJ Barrett is something special. Knicks really got a good one with him. That whole top 4 of that draft can all become all stars and I wouldn’t be surprised at all.  Jayson looked great outside of the ball handling issues which isn’t a normal thing, the Knicks threw **A LOT** of double teams at him and hopefully eventually he will get used to that, because they will keep coming.   Another positive, was the refs. This may end up getting many downvotes because this sub hates the Celtics and Celtics fans specifically for obvious and very fair reasons, but the refs have really not been on our side this year. Jayson and Jaylen get destroyed so much, just hacked over and over and get nothing and then I have to watch someone like Embiid or Harden (not as much this year) just throw it up essentially and get a foul call. But this game, though there were still bad calls (which is expected from Brothers and a rookie ref at this point), it seemed pretty even at least imo.  All around, solid game. Good defense, offense will be better with Kemba and Fournier, obviously."
I like just “Romeo Langford” (quotes included) better
Robert Williams III and Romeo Langford
"From an outsider's perspective, letting Hayward walk hurt their depth. And then losing some bigs hurt as well. Their strategy isn't to have a traditional big, but they just are quite young still. I haven't watched many of their games, but my impression is that they're back-court heavy and if you face a team with good d on outside shooters (which sixers do), it's difficult for them.  I think they also missed Fournier tonight. Their second unit is fairly weak. If I'm facing them, I'm not too worried about Romeo Langford, Luke Kornet, Ojeleye, or Grant Williams lighting me up, and so if I have a strong second unit, it's difficult to keep pace."
Yeah not getting locked up by Romeo Langford
I just commented to someone else saying ... even if they were fully healthy I don’t think they’d be contenders ...tho I do think they’d be 7- 10games over 500 ...   But you’re right the covid shit specifically hasn’t been mostly their “key” players but their lack of depth already forces those players to have a bit more importance. then when a actual key player gets hurt like smart or kemba they get even more important ..for example Romeo Langford I think will be a key player tonight with Fournier out
My point is the player-days missed stat isn’t a very valuable metric since it doesn’t adjust to the playing time of the players missed.   Romeo Langford missing 1 game is the same as Tatum missing 1 game for this stat.   Never said anything about the Celtics performance or what Tatum or Brown are playing through. No need to retort to insulting someone that isn’t even arguing with you.
"Romeo Langford contributes a lot to this stat, but Tatum missed time from COVID, Brown has missed time from his knee, Smart was injured all of February, and Kemba was out at the beginning of the year and sits b2b’s. We’ve definitely been hurt by it more than most teams, but the stat feels slightly exaggerated with the 10 lowest teams combined thing because Langford didn’t play for 49 games"
"I mean in r/bostonceltics I’m known as being **the** Romeo Langford guy. After Romeo’s game last week the thread was pretty much a bunch of people being like “u/Spinexel, you were right.”"
"Our best player Romeo Langford just played his first game of the season last night, leave us be"
Romeo Langford
"I mean, shut down the league right now. Romeo Langford is back.  Banner 18. Confirmed."
Romeo Langford.
Romeo Langford exists.
"So this is the mythical ""Romeo Langford"" I have been hearing about for the last 2 years."
Romeo Langford exists!
I'm frankly gobsmacked to see that Romeo Langford is a real person. He's playing well too wtf
"Romeo Langford out with an ""illness"" for like a month. Weird!"
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"Yeah Danny. It’s the players fault that you replaced Kyrie Irving, Rozier, Hayward and Horford with Evan Fournier, Rob Will, Nesmith, Pritchard and Romeo fucking Langford."
"I mean yeah he's hit well on his top 10 picks but I think he really flubbed the past two drafts.   Cap-wise he put the Celtics into a position with maxing Kemba that meant they couldn't make any real trades (no tradeable contracts for salary matching). If you have your core of Kemba/Smart/the Jays then he should've doubled down more on drafting older, ready-to-contribute guys like Payton Prichard.   He traded away both Matisse Thybulle and Desmond Bane, hard pills to swallow. Also Romeo Langford has bust potential written all over him; I would've taken Brandon Clarke in a heartbeat."
"Smart missed 6 weeks  Tatum got Covid  Jaylen has had knee issue lingering for weeks  Kemba missed the first 13 games and doesn't play on B2B's  Jeff Teague was horrifically awful and TT has missed multiple games on 2 occasions due to Health and Safety Protocols  Romeo Langford might not exist  Semi, Carsen and Grant all struggle to be consistent producing bench players.   Nesmith hasn't been given an opportunity consistently to show what he can do. He went from not playing to in the rotation and then out to then being played sparingly.   They just have lapses in games and the defense has been terrible. Every game some random average player will go off and score 25-30 points.   Danny didn't construct a very talented roster  Brad had his moments early in the year where I questioned a lot of his decisions but now it's just the players lack off effort and pride.   *So basically the only thing that's gone right is the emergence of Timelord and the steal of a pick in Pritchard who's been great all year. Plus the continued development of the J's (but let's be honest they've both had their moments of being pretty bad)*"
"Why even trade for him when they have a young lottery pick that barely gets playing time for development, Romeo Langford, who is much better than genital bacteria"
Romeo Langford will save us
I wanted Romeo Langford or Kevin Porter Jr. in that draft. I was thinking Herro was gonna go in the mid 20s or somethin lol.
"*Is Romeo real, or a mere myth?* I ask myself.  It’s already 4:00 pm, just two hours until the gala. I’ve already taken two shots of my red tinted beverage. Unsure of myself I ponder about the world.   As my mind drifts it keeps coming back to me, *why is Romeo Langford? Who is Romeo Langford? Is Romeo Langford?*   I take another sip.   Although I cannot answer the question, I keep asking it. Maybe I’m just under the weather. Maybe my mind is blurry from yesterday. I’m not sure. All I know is that the time is almost here.   Romeo Langford will play basketball again."
#ITS HAPPENING  Edit: didn’t realize this wasn’t r/bostonceltics. People know me as the Romeo Langford guy.
"""…there is an idea of a Romeo Langford, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my streaky shooting and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our stats are probably comparable: I simply am not there. It is hard for me to make sense on any given level"""
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  Ainge had a contending roster with Kyrie and Hayward but Kyrie's a headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. Then prior to last season it became an issue of too many mouths to feed and didn't lead to roster cohesion.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
Kevin “Romeo Langford” Durant
"Tatum: MVP &amp; 1st &amp; 2nd Team All-NBAs,  perennial All-Star   Brown: Keeps making All-Star, makes at least 1 All-NBA team  Marcus Smart: Continues making 1st Team All-Defense  Rob Williams: DPOY   Romeo Langford: 6MOY  Kemba: Hovers around pre-injury Kemba  Aaron Nesmith: Klay Thompson lite  Payton Pritchard: Better TJ McConnell  2 Championships. Break the tie with the Lakers. Beat the Lakers in the Finals"
the celtics really passed up thybulle for romeo langford
"That pick was actually a coin flip away Tyler Herro. So just pure luck it turned into Langford instead. And Romeo is still very young, there is a good chance he can bounce back from his injuries and turn into a real asset"
"All they really ended up getting from that pick was Romeo Langford, so it’s not like they benefited from the King’s actual pick."
"For people who don't watch the Celtics...he's got the physical tools for sure. He's been injured for the majority of the past 2 years, and he was at the end of our bench/g-league as a rookie since we had Horford/Banes/Theis. He basically hasn't had any time to develop, this is basically is 'first' season.  Keep an eye out for Romeo Langford in the future, same issue with him."
"&gt;Celtics trade for: Chris Boucher   &gt;   &gt;Raptors get: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 FRP in 2022 and 2024  What the fuck? 2 lottery picks + 2 FRP'S?  Boucher is great, but for that price tag? Hell no.  &gt;DEAL 2:   &gt;   &gt;Celtics trade for: Lonzo Ball and Wily Hernangomez   &gt;   &gt;Pelicans get: Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard  Lonzo Ball has been shooting lights out, but he's not a better defender than Smart (heart and soul of our team too,) and why the fuck are we losing all of our guard depth? I'd rather keep Smart + PP over Lonzo Ball.  Ball is gonna get paid + RFA. We could lose him.   DEAL 3:  &gt;Celtics trade for: PJ Tucker   &gt;   &gt;Rockets get: Tristan Thompson and 2022 2nd Rd. Pick   &gt;   &gt;Use Exception to SIGN **Andre Drummond** \[offer him guaranteed big role\] and cut Theis/Wily  You're fucking high."
You mean they don’t want Romeo Langford and a late 1st for one of their best players?   What a surprise
"Sorry bro, league rules state we need to trade Vooch for Romeo Langford and salary filler"
"&gt; Romeo Langford  I feel like Langford is our new Rozier.   Danny will refuse to include him in a trade for a role player and get laughed at, the same way he kept Rozier (who was DNPing) out of the Ibaka talks.  I just wouldn't be surprised if we get a clip in 10-15 days of Nick Wright laughing at Danny Ainge for holding onto Langford. Which ofc means it's probably the right move all along."
John Collins to Minnesota for something centered around Malik Beasely and Jaden Mcdaniels  Harrison Barnes to Boston for Romeo Langford and a first  George Hill to the Clippers for Lou Williams and Detroit seconds
Romeo Langford according to idealistic Celtics fans
We gave up the pick that became Romeo Langford... not gonna lose any sleep over that.
"Mark my words, Romeo Langford will be a stud in this league."
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
"You say that he sits on his hands when he has made multiple big time trades (one that even won a championship) in his tenure. Recently we made the Kyrie trade which was a massive deal. We also traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford, we traded Pierce and KG for the picks that got us Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown + more, we traded for Kevin Garnett and went from the worst team in the league to the NBA champions the next year, we traded for Isaiah Thomas who became 4th in MVP voting. This narrative is straight bullshit. This sub seems to think that we need to make a major roster shaking deal each year which is straight up dumb. Our 2 best players are 23 and 24, we have no reason to rush the process and shorten their championship window to win now when neither of them are in their prime yet."
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
"He fixes literally all of the depth issues for the Celtics. Team defense is a different story, but right now our wing depth behind Tatum and Brown is   - Grant Williams, who is a 6'6"" Center with no athletic upside  - Semi Ojeleye, who lifts weights but is not necessarily good at basketball, per se  - Aaron Nesmith, who has as many DNP's as GP and is clearly not ready, nor do I blame him as a rookie  - Romeo Langford, who is a ghost with less than 400 minutes logged in his NBA career and who hasn't played in a calendar year.   Throwing an actual NBA level wing into the mix solves by far the biggest hole on the roster. Especially now with Robert Williams looking like he can be something at 5 for us, if we can avoid rolling Grant Williams and Ojeleye out in anything besides garbage time, we might actually be able to get some W's going  Doesn't matter though, because it doesn't seem like Detroit is interested in trading him at all, and we couldn't really offer a package good enough to get him anyways IMO."
"Yeah. Our 4 best players have only played like 20 minutes together plus, we haven't had last years lotto pick Romeo Langford all year."
"Romeo Langford and a 2032 2nd for Collins, who says no?"
"I agree that this gets blown out of proportion - something that Celtic beat writers also like to do btw. Romeo Langford is like the new MJ according to some.   But it’s undeniable that THT will be a rotation player. So many teams struggle to find rotation players - something the Celtics know about this year. Drafting rotation players after the 20th pick has steep odds, despite this the Lakers FO has been able to for years now. That should say something, and it’s basically our only claim to fame with our FO. The one thing we can point to and say “this is something we have a proven track record of”.   I know for a fact that THT had buzz around the draft, after great play at Iowa St., and an injury made him drop deep into the 2nd.  He’s got an insane frame, great strength, handle, finishes good at the rim and rebounds. No he’s not a future all star but could definitely see him becoming a starter at some point and he’s only 20. It’s not baseless that other teams are seriously looking at him.  I think many teams would gladly offer him 5-7 million a year for his upside, and due to the fact that he’s already gonna be a RFA"
"After 2017 Draft where Tatum was drafted     2018 - Robert Williams III (A developing young player capable of being a Starting Caliber Center in the league)   2019 - Romeo Langford (We just have to wait and see but he has potential), Grant Williams (I know some of you have given up on him but I still believe he is just given the wrong role and position. He was nice in the playoffs against the Heats last year and showed flashes that he can be a poor man's PJ Tucker (The Poorman's Draymond Green)   2020 - Payton Pritchard (Impact Role Player), Aaron Neismith (Still young but is already good defensively, a good college shooter and showed flashes of that in the NBA)      Now you can't expect young player to be as good as the top picks immediately. Brown didn't become who he is today from day 1. Rozier is not that good the first few years here in Boston. Case in point, you got to have patience and not jump to conclusions immediately regarding these young players."
"Smart, rozier, brown, and Tatum went 6, 16, 3, 3. Since the Tatum draft, their first round picks have been:  2018: Robert Williams, 26th  2019: Romeo Langford, 14th. Matisse Thybulle, 20th (traded to philly). Grant Williams, 22nd.   2020: Aaron Nesmith, 14th. Payton Pritchard, 26th. Desmond Bane, 30th (traded to Memphis)  So basically your whole point was just trying to say that when you draft in the lottery, it’s easier to have good picks than when you draft in the teens and twenties lol. Hard hitting analysis buddy, thank you."
A player of romeo Langford caliber can be picked up with a second round pick.
"He probably is worth that to Sacramento.  For what Barnes brings to the table, Romeo Langford doesn't move the needle at all , or shouldn't at least"
Y’all not rockin with Romeo Langford?
Would definitely be more enticing if Romeo Langford hasn’t been complete ass for the majority of his career and injured for the rest.
"Yea that 27th pick and romeo langford is really gunna do the trick to take our 3rd best player and 2 year starter, great locker room prescence on a good deal away."
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
I swear to God if Ainge can flip Romeo Langford and a first for Harrison Barnes I'm gonna have an aneurism.
"Completely forgot about how good of a job the Celtics have done stockpiling generational talents.  Tatum and Brown would be fools not to spend their primes with Jevonte Green, Grant Williams, Carson Edwards, and Romeo Langford"
"Forgot to mention the other championship contender and basically favorite that had two all stars.  You should go ahead and make your bets on us now. We lost to the Pistons twice, we have two all stars, and Romeo Langford is Steph Curry with a jump shot."
Romeo Langford looked like a perfect mix of Beal and DeRozan in high school🙃
Is Romeo Langford a wing?  Is Romeo Langford even real?
I'd say last offseason was pretty bad too considering he drafted Romeo Langford and grant Williams in the first round and traded Rozier for Kemba.
"The Jay's have another 1-2 years before they BEGIN to enter their 'prime years.' You can't expect the Celtics to compete for anything while their centerpieces have yet to even enter their primes. Let's wait to see what this team can do in the playoffs once that happens before we make a judgement call on whether or not Brown will want out.  Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are both extremely inexperienced. If anything Grant has shown he can be a solid 3-and-D guy. There are other young players on the team that have shown a lot of promise: Williams III, Pritchard, Nesmith. 1-2 years down the line when the Jay's are playing in their primes, these player's will have gained valuable experience and will able to contribute important minutes not to mention will also be valuable trade assets if you combine them with someone like Smart.  Virtually 2 in 3 teams in the league's futures can be painted as ""bleak"" if you frame everything in terms like OP has."
Hey watch out in 2027 Romeo Langford will be averaging 8 points a game
Romeo Langford.
"&gt;- The Celtics have the 6th highest payroll in the NBA next season, not including a new deal for free agent Evan Fournier    So... why does this mean a bleak future?   &gt;- Kemba Walker has one of the worst contracts in the league    There's only 1+1 left and he averaged 19, 4 &amp; 5 this year, after starting really slow from injury.   &gt;- Most of their young players like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford have disappointed    Tatum, Brown, Williams, Pritchard, Nesmith haven't disappointed   &gt;- They own no future first round picks from other teams    So... they don't owe anyone any picks. Why is it bleak to not own other teams picks?   &gt;- Marcus Smart will likely have to be traded this summer or else the Celtics tax bill will be massive. And if they don't trade him, they certainly will not be able to sign him to a big new deal next summer when his contract ends.    Why can't they pay him? Why does he have to be traded?   Also, if he's traded then it won't be for nothing. They will get value in return."
Philly was in a much worse spot last year than Boston is this year since they had that horrible horford contract too. I think Boston will be fine but they need to upgrade their bench. I am sure they could package Thompson Romeo Langford and grant Williams into someone good from a team that’s tanking and maybe trade smart for something as well
"Great as always, thanks. Good info on it not necessarily being a big deal even if it was on his dominant hand, since Romeo Langford had exactly that.  Unrelated: are you an alum if you didn't graduate yet?"
I think Pritchard and nesmith can be something for them but they are both bench guys  The other guys they drafted two years ago have been a disaster. Grant Williams Romeo Langford and Edwards have all given them nothing   And then yea the rest of the bench is absolutely atrocious. If the pistons can find guys who can shoot decently well for cheap then the Celtics should be able to as well
How is Romeo Langford so bad that Carsen Edwards plays above him 😂 total bust
"&gt;also i want to see tatum try to do what embiid did last year, even though the rest of the team is still better than what embiid had around him after ben went down.  Idk about this man the Celtics roster is dogshit. Their 5th 6th and 7th best players are player Robert Williams, Peyton Pritchard and Romeo Langford. That shit is bleakkkkk"
I knew it was bad when I saw the Celtics sub listing Romeo Langford and Peyton Pritchard as good bench guys for a team they considered a contender. Like Grant Williams started a fair amount of games for you and he is the biggest puddle of nothing I've ever seen in an NBA uniform
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"
"The problem is our starting 5 is really all we have going for us.  Kemba/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Timelord is a arguably a top 5 starting 5 in the NBA, but our supporting cast stops and ends with Tristan Thompson and Evan Fournier. It's not completely awful, especially with the addition of Fournier, but the rest of our bench players are young and not ready to carry the load off the bench. Pritchard is maybe the closest, but he's still learning.  I'm not a doomer by any means, I think we have one of, if not the, brightest future of any team in the NBA, certainly in the eastern conference, but the fact of the matter is out role-players are a lot weaker than other contenders this year, and it would take all of our best 7 guys staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs, as well as an 8th/9th guy off the bench (one of Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, and Aaron Nesmith) making a big leap *in a playoff push* for us to really and truly contend."
"Also going from worst record in league to NBA championship in 1 offseason and trading down from the first pick for Tatum and Romeo Langford  And he really isn’t fucking up. Like, when?"
"Romeo Langford has been a great defender this year but is basically a 0 on offense. He still hasn't had a healthy offseason yet and missed most of this year with injury and COVID so most fans still have a lot of hope for his ability to develop.  Grant Williams has gotten a lot better at 3 point shooting this year but his defense has slipped a bit. Fouls too much and gets blown by too easily. Drew a short straw with the rotation situation since his best position is small-ball 5 and we had 3 rotation centers ahead of him for the majority of the year. If he can get his defense up to par, he can definitely have a good career as a role player.  Carsen Edwards hasn't been as garbage as he was last year but he still doesn't belong anywhere near a rotation. When his shot isn't falling, he adds literally nothing on the court.   Tremont Waters has had some good moments when he plays with the actual rotation guys when the team is short-handed but when he is out there with the third-stringers it has been disastrous. Tough to be anything but a liability when you are 5'10.   Tacko Fall hasn't really changed at all since his first year. Very situational player. Makes too many mistakes. He is beloved by all though so it is nice having him on the roster."
"The Celtics main roster though was healthy for the majority of the year.   Guys they were missing (like Romeo Langford) make up a huge % of those minutes. The Pelicans as well had big shakeups with their roster and made multiple win later trades heading into this season.   However if you are making an argument of who’s the better offensive player, the answer is clearly Zion who scores more on close to 8% better efficiency."
"The famous 2015 trade with Philadelphia  Sixers get: Jason Thompson, Carl Landry, Nik Stauskas, Kings 2019 FRP (ended up at 12th and went to Boston [Romeo Langford]), pick swaps in the first round in 2016 &amp; 2017  Kings get: draft rights to Arturas Gudaitis and Luka Mitrovic (who?) and.. cap space  We used that cap space for Rondo, Belinelli, and Kosta Koufos"
"Celtics have a ton of roster holes though. Kemba noticeably declining and still on that massive contract is a strangle hold on their cap space. They still need a starting caliber long-term solution at center and it’s not Robert Williams. They keep losing key free agents for close to nothing. Almost all of their recent draft picks are meh (Ex. Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Nesmith, etc.)   I’d rather be the Knicks with a ton of young rising talent, a marquee market to attract FA’s and a ton of projected cap space going forward the next few years."
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
"That pick the following year just became Romeo Langford, which is looking like good value for 14th overall, but when the Sixers traded such a decreasingly protected King's pick to move up for Fultz, the best bet was that that pick would end up top 5.  IDK how exactly we're determining credit here, but you could attribute a solid bluff to Philly FO for seeing that De'Aaron and dem boys were gonna be a near-playoff team, hella de-valuing that pick.    With as much as Danny Ainge seemed zeroed in on Tatum as his guy, I'm not sure he trades away #1 knowing he's only getting #3 and #14 in return.  Colangelos kinda deserve some credit there. They won that trade (based purely on the draft pick value chart) aaannnd right up until they drafted Fultz... and then immediately crushed his spirits under all the pressure to immediately be great &amp; learning to shoot differently than he ever had before."
"Being aggressive isn’t always a good thing.   The sixers were very aggressive over the past 2 years and all they managed to do was lose talent and overpay people. The mavs’ aggression has led to them to give a 5 year contract to kristaps that will probably handicap them for a few years.  The teams best positioned for long term contention in the east are the bucks, Celtics, heat. The bucks only made their move when Giannis had shown that he could be a top 5 player in the league. They then pushed in their chips for Jrue.   The Celtics main issue rn isn’t their lack of aggression, it’s their inability to draft anyone that is good. Pretty much every player they have drafted since tatum sucks. If they got clarke, bane, or any of the 4 year senior guys instead of drafting bums like romeo Langford they would be a much better team."
Romeo Langford and Seth Curry
Romeo Langford with that -26 in 18 minutes yikes.
Glad didn't watched Romeo Langford running around for 18 mins.
Romeo Langford really came through for the nets tonight
Still waiting for Romeo Langford to have any impact on an NBA game
"Celtics are starting Tristan Thompson, Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye. Yuck. enjoy the 1 seed Nets"
"Stop trying to frame this like Kemba is doing anything, we are clearly better because Romeo Langford is using his super powers."
Lmao you guys suck.  You couldn’t beat Romeo Langford and Tristan Thompson lmao
Romeo “one and done in college whilst shooting 27% from 3” Langford you say??
"As a Laker fan I was very happy with how well the Kings did that season. After all, the Celtics owned their draft pick that year so I wanted it to be as bad as possible, and as a result of the Kings success Boston only ended up with Romeo Langford 😂"
"Ah yes, if only every team had a Romeo Langford instead"
&gt;Just hold the L and delete the comments my man.  Ironic + cry more + Romeo Langford is a bust + Danny Ainge is senile + Gordon Hayward gone for nothing + ratio
"""Rent free is dumb no one is thinking about this dude at night""  \*proceeds to write a paragraph about why nobody is thinking about him in a thread where he was randomly brought up\*  &gt;I’m pretty sure I remember really hoping the Heat drafted him because he looked awful in that NCAA tournament “run”  I'm sure you're ecstatic with having Romeo Langford who was drafted 1 pick after him and has 101 career points in 2 seasons.  Bonus: [Report: Celtics were ‘very much enamored’ with Tyler Herro, whom Heat took one pick before Boston](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/23/report-celtics-were-very-much-enamored-with-tyler-herro-whom-heat-took-one-pick-before-boston/)  [Tyler Herro says his 2019 NBA draft suit is at his parent's house, ""It's probably too small for me now. It was already tight."" He reflected on Instagram Live that he thought he was going a pick later to the Celtics.](https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1328838481670524929)"
"**Positives:**  Tatum had arguably his best game of his career in every aspect outside of scoring.  Tremont Waters redemption arc.  Romeo Langford D  Jabari Parker looks solid  Jaylen Brown continues to be hot  Danny Ainge commentary was great.  **Negatives:**  We lost, obviously.  Tatum had his worst scoring game in a while.   Brad continues to play Grant even though he is absolutely terrible.  Brad.  Jaylen only 15 shots and got iced out in the fourth.   All around I’m not too worried about Tatum, I mean, he has been amazing for weeks, just had an off night. Layups he makes every time going halfway down and rolling out, not to mention our best three guards and two best playmakers were out. Losing the win streak and the current seeding (obviously there is still season left) sucks, but it isn’t a loss to freak out about."
Wait until you guys see Romeo Langford. You think these guys are sleepy.
"Yeah from my perspective getting Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Kyrie Irving because of a trade was a terrible idea"
"I was told Romeo Langford being injured all year was hurting the Celtics, but he's just as bad as Ojeleye."
Romeo Langford will key a Celtics championship run and be all NBA defense in 2 years
Steve Kerr obviously doesn't know who Romeo Langford is smh
"Romeo Langford has proven he's a good player when he's healthy, his problem is he's almost never been healthy thus far in his career. He's got all the tools to be an elite 3&amp;D wing."
Incoming Celtics fans to tell me about how Romeo Langford is akshually “ a really good finisher”
Double Jaylen Brown and let Romeo Langford beat you.  You are going to lose anyway.
Romeo Langford just out there running. Why do the Celtics play him so much
Romeo Langford. For a time I was curious if he even existed.
"hopefully it won’t be like Romeo Langford and “wherefore art thou, Romeo?” which has potential to be a great line except announcers use it at every opportunity possible, he’ll literally get a block and the color commentator is all “wherefore art” this and “wherefore art” that"
Romeo Langford
"Rob getting more play time brings a lot of energy and ball movement, we have proof of life of Romeo Langford, and the more Smart wins the more he doesn't want to lose."
Didn't the pick you traded for Fultz become Romeo Langford?
Don’t forget TY Hilton Darius Leonard Romeo Langford Yogi Ferrell and a lot more. The list goes on and on
"Let’s hope so, I think they just needed more time. If Tatum is what we think he is and Brown does anything but regresses we’ll be in good shape. Rob Williams is a surprise too. I really like Romeo Langford, Pritchard and Nesmith too.  Good luck with Weismann. I really think Wiggins could eventually bo good as well. I’m excited to see how Thompson returns and of course Curry is ridiculous."
"It’s not always about immediately winning the trade.   This current Portland roster is not championship caliber and has no way to get to that unless they trade Dame and do a proper, successful rebuild. They missed their chance, now they have to move on to the next era. Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford will be very good for them."
Romeo Langford
"I don't think anyone is saying Wiseman has a zero percent chance of being a superstar.   But I think it's reasonable to think he has a roughly similar chance to someone like Kira Lewis, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, etc"
Romeo Langford to me is like a slightly worse on defense Matisse Thybulle to most Sixers fans.
"Ainge made lots of good decisions. Also lots of bad decisions. He just never seemed to make *average* decisions.  Like... he traded away the #1 overall pick and still got the best player in that draft. I can't think of another GM who would risk that at all, let alone risk it and succeed. But he also drafted Grant Williams and Romeo Langford in the first round a couple years later, on purpose and everything.  If you look at his drafts, trades, and free agent acquisitions, the net result was basically league average. But I don't think a single individual transaction he made could be described as average, y'know? It's strange."
"Idk, a floor-spacing point guard who can run plays would be very valuable for this sixers team. Especially one that can actually target Trae Young on offense.   Lmao, have fun wasting Jayson and Jaylen with Kemba's ruined knees, and Romeo Langford?"
Please be Romeo Langford
Tatum and the pick that turned out to be Romeo Langford for Fultz
"Yeah, Romeo Langford is a stud in the making."
"I feel like the trade is not as bad with hindsight, considering that the Celtics were taking Tatum #1 anyway. Essentially you guys only gave up Romeo Langford (and the slightly higher rookie salary for Fultz vs Tatum), which makes it look not as bad"
romeo langford&gt;giannis
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
"And Jaylen and Timelord were injured. And THJ ~ Fournier. Also Celtics were playing large minute Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, Aaron Nesmith. I have hopes for their future but compared to  DFS, KP, Kleber etc they are definitely a tier below."
It took the whole season and a playoff series where they dropped a game to Romeo Langford to realize these guys have bad D?
"So in other words, 5 games against a Celtics team who was starting Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier and Tristan Thompson until they had to start Romeo Langford... yuh"
"I'll give you Jaylen is better than Ingram.  But the Pelicans have a shit ton of draft picks plus offer promising rookie deal guys like Jaxon Hayes.    And don't say Romeo Langford, his trade value is nil."
Romeo Langford
Who was he primarily guarding? Payton Prichard? Carsen Edwards? Romeo Langford? Kemba? I'm seriously curious.  I think that's a throwaway stat since it's been 5 games and the Celtics didn't have a 2nd guy cause JB and Kemba were hurt.
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
Well I'm not putting much value on his opinion if he has Grant Williams higher than Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith
Sources tell me Romeo Langford is extra gruntled
“Romeo Langford needs an exorcism”
"Smart didn't have a good year - I love him, but I think there's a good chance he's gone. Rob Williams looked good, but he's a fine starter at best for now. Romeo Langford is passable but not good. Fournier is fine, but we only got him to use our trade exception.  This team was never healthy, but I didn't see anything that makes me think this is even close to a potential Finals team."
"Not possible.  Ainge had asked the Bulls to wait until free agency so he could take a shot using their max cap space, but the Bulls wanted a draft day trade so they could get who they wanted.  That year, getting Butler would have meant not being able to sign Hayward, trading away Brown and losing a draft pick which probably would be the pick the got Romeo.  &amp;#x200B;  So all in all it would have been Butler for Hayward, Brown and Langford.  I don't see how that makes the Celtics better.  (Keep in mind at the time we didn't know Hayward would snap his ankle)."
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
"Copy/pasting this from /u/_irongiant_'s comment in the Celtics sub, just to provide context to the negative things he's done over the past two years.  &gt; In my eyes this is a much needed move. Ainge had a great stretch as a GM until 2019 but since then it's just been blunder after blunder.  &gt; Coming away with Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Grizzlies pick for anything  &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt; So many blunders in the span of 2 years has left this team asset-less and in a bad spot. 99% of GMs would have been fired over these moves/non-moves, so Ainge would be doing us a favor by stepping down.  Granted, I don't agree with the ""we drafted this guy instead of this better player"" logic just because that's all hindsight, but all the other reasons are valid."
once tatum leaves do you think you guys are gonna build around romeo langford or payton pritchard?
Can't wait for Pep to overthink and play Romeo Langford at Center in a Finals game.
"At least he had 08 championship to fall back on, but he had a roster to go to finals with Brad Stevens as the coach. It was combination of injuries, personalities, and free agency which hinder those roster to reach the finals.  They have Brown and Tatum, but rarely anything else unless Celtic fans believe Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Grant Williams will get better. Is Kemba Walker knee going to hold up to his shifty moves he will put stress on his knees?"
"&gt; Romeo is a injury prone ball handler who can't shoot or finish at the rim and shoots 35% from the field for his career so far. Saying 1 game is proof that he it's ""obvious"" he's going to be a good player is insane talk. He's trending towards bust not good player.  He's 21.  If he didn't come out early he'd only be a junior in college still.  Let's hold off on the ""injury prone"" label.  If you can't see the raw talent in Langford I don't know what to say.  It's all just a matter of development for him."
"&gt; It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Romeo is a injury prone ball handler who can't shoot or finish at the rim and shoots 35% from the field for his career so far. Saying 1 game is proof that he it's ""obvious"" he's going to be a good player is insane talk. He's trending towards bust not good player.    &gt; These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.   It was a widely panned move at the time and you can see why. Bane was regarded by many as a top 20 talent in the draft and has shown why this season. It always was a bad decision which only happened because Ainge never consolidated all those draft picks and it resulted in us not being able to take on 3 rookies in one offseason.    &gt; Really don't see the issue here. He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed. You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE.  TT had a good playoff series but otherwise was a huge negative all season long"
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
"He was great up until 2019 but has been bad since then.   - Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.   - Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing   - Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything   - Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   - Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing   - Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract   - Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson     Then there was the whole ""I haven't seen any racism in TD Garden"" thing which may or may not have alienated some of the players.    99% of GMs would have been fired for having the 2 year stretch Ainge did. Him stepping down is doing us a favor."
"I mean he basically traded Markell fultz for jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.   Picked robin Williams with a late first round pick  Picked Payton Pritchard with a late first round pick   Assembled great teams of multiple all stars that have been ravaged by injuries.   Made big free agent signings of kemba walker, al Hortford , Gordon Hayward.   Traded for Kyrie with a hurt IT4 and a pick that ended up being Colin sexton.   Not all of these worked out but they were definitely the right move at the time"
"&gt;the guys we picked in the 20s (Pritchard, the Williamses) look better than the guys we picked at 14 (Langford, Nesmith)  ?????????????????????   Romeo and Aaron have both been significantly more impactful players than Grant Williams. Other than Robert Williams they're also the ones with the most potential to develop into something more than just a solid role players"
Romeo Langford
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
Romeo Langford as the 4th option? Surprisingly not as bad as expected.
"Positive takeaways:  -Romeo Langford playing offense (we knew his defense was great already)  -Jabari Parker deserves to be on an NBA roster  -Grant Williams is actually okay at basketball when he gets to play the 5  -a healthy Robert Williams is gonna get a triple double with blocks at some point  -Consistent Effort! For six straight games!  -Jayson Tatum was getting elbowed in the face, poked in the eye, slapped in the head, bear-hugged, and double/triple teamed for 6 play-in/playoff games and averaged 33.8-6.2-4.5-1.2-1.7  Now we let everyone get healthy and come back next season with one of the best wing duos in the league. Let’s go Bruins!"
35 FG% 3ppg Romeo Langford starting is neat though.
"Crazy, I thought Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, and Tremont Waters would be able to provide offense for the second unit.  Seriously tho. How did ainge manage to fuck this up so badly?"
Not a lot of highlights this series for us but Romeo Langford developing an offensive game is awesome
Celtics with a starting five including Romeo Langford is a moral victory.
And is being guarded by Romeo Langford lmao
"Romeo Langford, defensive stopper??"
Romeo “Rudy Gobert” Langford
Romeo Langford is what we in the business call POOP POOP players
romeo langford was so fucking good in HS
FRP + Romeo Langford should move Kemba's deal.
"I don’t think anything racial has been said yet, hopefully nobody stoops to something like that. And I hate that a bottle was thrown, unacceptable. Glad he got arrested.  I don’t know what you want the fans to do that are unhappy about it. Should we all pitch in and buy PEDs and pump them into Romeo Langford? Should I suit up and face Kyrie? Our only response is to bitch and complain, literally all we can do (that is within acceptable limits). Besides, getting mad about it is fun. It’s all fun, you guys are taking our reaction too seriously (except bottle guy), stop white knighting for kyrie and chill.  “If you don’t like it, beat him.” Okay lol"
"His defense isn’t that amazing. Sometimes he just runs around.  This is pretty far off from past Celtics teams that used switchable, high iq vets to hold down the fort: guys like theis, hortford, Wanamaker, crowder, Bradley.  There’s a reason that the Celtics overhelp too much. Romeo isn’t good enough on D for Marcus smart to trust him to stay with his man.  I’d like to see where ainge goes this year because he’s generally been very good at the undervalued international/veteran player game, but imo Langford is not that guy."
Did you forget that they have to get through Romeo Langford first?
"i think milwaukee can match up better than anyone defensively with jrue, middleton, and giannis. obviously with these caliber scorers it comes down to team defense, but it will be a big step going from romeo langford checking kyrie to jrue holiday."
he was wiping the blood of Romeo Langford off his shoe
&gt;Also how do you miss that lmao legit walking 2 MPH  Must have been Romeo Langford
celtics tried but when the nets are clicking on offense you cant be starting TT and romeo langford and hope to stay close
Romeo Langford forcing the Nets hand
"Yeah, only because he’s defending Romeo Langford and the boys  I’d look like a nice defender too if I was just guarding Tony Allen at the corner all game"
Romeo Langford what are you doing lol
More like Romeo Langford botches a 4v1 lol
Because Romeo Langford took it up against Durant lol
More like Romeo Langford stops a 4 on 1 fast break
Romeo Langford thought he was that dude.  Narrator: He was not that dude.
How to run a fast break in the worst possibly way: featuring Romeo Langford.
romeo langford is very lanky. holy moly
Romeo Langford isn’t the guy I want matched up with Kyrie or Harden
"yeah, replacing Kemba with Romeo Langford will definitely make our *defense* worse, you got it"
Celtics starting human white flag Romeo Langford. This will be ugly!
This is the game where we stop looking at romeo Langford as a mediocre bench prospect and start taking him seriously as a top 5 sg of all time
Him and Romeo Langford.
"“Good”. More like mostly average. Playoff teams have deph. Sorry Nets fan, but Romeo Langford and Grant Williams isn’t deph lmao. Don’t worry y’all will still win the series though"
He’s a poor mans Romeo Langford.
"Lmao celtics started Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford that game. Their second highest scorer was Rookie Payton Pritchard. They were missing Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, AND Robert Williams as well"
"The irony lol... we should be “playing better defense” to stop tatum from shooting 15 FTs, but if harden shoots 12 FTs it’s rigged!1!1! So fucked up that we were given so many low-quality free throws when scrubs like harden were being guarded by stars of this league like Romeo Langford 😫😫😫"
I guess I'm just confused because Romeo Langford for sure did win us this game. Not sure why you're talking about ice cream in a basketball discussion.
"Romeo Langford opted to just stay at his hometown high-school, which was unfortunately our rival high-school. We didn't make it out of sectionals for a few years there -_-"
"&gt; Ok scratch that game from the record. 17-15 when their 3 best players play is still not good  Lol... and you're still counting a bunch of games where we've been massively injured?  For example the game before that:  * Kemba had only just come back from his knee procedure and was still on minute restrictions * Tatum had just come back from covid * Brown was starting to miss time due to tendonitis * Payton Pritchard was also out with an MCL  You're looking at games without any understanding of what was happening in those games.   Instead of blindly throwing numbers around, if you actually looked at those ~30 games you'd see there's a lot more going on than you realise.  &gt;Small sample size + seemingly cherrypicked   Why do you think the sample size is small?   We played 72 games and had our core 4 together for less than we did during the 17 games of playoffs last year.    Period| Games Played| Minutes Played ---|---|---- 2020 playoffs (17 games)| 17| 349 2020-21 Season (72 games)| 17| 292   You're using these stats terms without any understanding of how/why they're relevant.  ""small sample size"" - Yeah exactly my point.  &gt; every team dealt with injuries this season.   All you're doing here is showing you don't understand scale.   Injuries aren't binary.  Phoenix having their top played lineup for 52 games and 706 minutes is very different to Boston having their top played lineup for 11 games and 131 minutes.  Just to put it into perspective, your top-played lineup this year had 22 games played. Twice our top played lineup. So no, your situation isn't comparable to ours.    &gt;To players like Robert Williams (one of the most injury prone players in the league), Romeo Langford (injury prone &amp; is not good), Nesmith (not good yet), and Tristan Thompson   I wasn't even counting the injuries to Langford and Nesmith (who didn't miss much time at all).  As I said, I'm talking purely:  1. Our top 4 players  2. Our playoff rotation  Langford and Nesmith aren't part of either."
"&gt;For example, one of those losses you've listed was a 1 point loss to the Lakers:  Ok scratch that game from the record. 17-15 when their 3 best players play is still not good  &gt;The Celtics are 8-2 when Kemba, Smart, Brown and Tatum are all playing without minute restrictions.  Small sample size + seemingly cherrypicked + every team dealt with injuries this season. I'm sure quite a few of those 8 wins where the celtics top 4 players were all nearly completely healthy were against either really bad teams, or teams dealing with injuries to their top guys  &gt;Plus, as Spinexel mentioned, we also had other injuries / covid cases outside of those 4.  To players like Robert Williams (one of the most injury prone players in the league), Romeo Langford (injury prone &amp; is not good), Nesmith (not good yet), and Tristan Thompson"
"I will not tolerate Celtics erasure, put some respect on Romeo Langford"
If this season wasn’t his reality check I don’t know what will. Knowing him though he’ll act like we have a brand new team because Romeo Langford won’t spend the entire offseason in a cast and because he’ll draft a 6’6 center
But those picks could be the next Romeo Langford.
"Idk, but I’m playing 2K MyLeague and the Kings are paying Romeo Langford 3yr/37.5M to ride the bench."
The Celtics drafted Romeo Langford instead of him
"Roll call for Romeo Langford, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye, Kadeem Allen, Jabari Bird, Guerschon Yabusele and Abdel Nader."
He won the Indiana state title with Romeo Langford at New Albany before transferring lol
"Easy to do against *check notes* Romeo Langford and Grant Williams, and all the other literal whos on the Celtics roster."
Romeo Langford and Aaron Neismith
they're rly playing Romeo Langford
So uh Romeo Langford is the answer? Sign me up!!!
"Brad Stevens should be playing Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Semi Ojeleye, and Grant Williams 48 minutes. Develop the rookie and play guys you don't care about to save the stars from potential injury."
"I saw kd, kyrie, harden, grant williams, luke kornet, carsen edwards, tremont waters, romeo langford, semi ojeleye, tristan thompson at that exact same party as Porzingis"
"Rozier was used to get Kemba. You can do these for every GM, although yes. Some of Danny’s choices have sucked. Criticizing 2nd rounders is really stupid, almost everybody misses on them. Grant Williams doesn’t have much higher to go, but he cannot he fully evaluated. Yam Madar isn’t even allowed to play in the NBA yet. Romeo Langford is hardly a bust yet, he is like Matisse Thybulle with even less offense due to never getting a full offseason. Nesmith has looked very good last few months and has a very high ceiling. But yeah, no excuses for guys like James Young. Everybody thought he would be great, but it’s on the GM for not finding the right guy."
"Pritchard at 27 isn’t anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that’s solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn’t like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it’s concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn’t pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
Does it really make the NBA worse. I don’t think the Celtics are sending Tatum to the G League finals just to try to get the 31st pick instead of the 32nd pick.  Just give me a chance to watch Romeo Langford play for 35 mins rather than 10 mins!
"Celtics didn't use the picks when the opportunity arose. That was the problem. They could have gotten stars or even good role players with them. Instead, they chose to keep the picks and are stuck with the likes of Romeo Langford, Grant Williams for their bench."
"The average value of a double-digit pick just isn't that high, is the thing. Most players picked later in the draft just aren't going to be stars. Sure, we don't have the track record of, like, the Raptors wrt late firsts, but since 2015 we've had 9 first-round picks outside the top 10 (not including the ones we immediately traded), of which:  — 2 (Terry Rozier, Rob Williams) are already starting-caliber players  — 2 (Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard) project to be very solid NBA players going forward  — 2 (Romeo Langford, Grant Williams) are fringe NBA-caliber players, although we've seen so little of Langford that he could end up either a tier down or up  — 3 (RJ Hunter, Guerschon Yabusele, Ante Zizic) were complete misses  For late firsts, I don't think that's a bad track record at all. He hasn't *completely* missed on a first-rounder since 2016 (though we'll see about Langford)."
We'll give you Romeo Langford and Grant Williams for Sabonis.
Romeo langford
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
Is Romeo Langford a significant upgrade?
cause they were playing an injured Celtics team starting some dude named Romeo Langford?  you saw how Houston struggled against OKC and lost quiickly in the 2nd round when Harden played with Westbrook. that's what KD had to deal with for 8 years
You didn't even get fleeced on that trade the pick became Romeo Langford who has played like 4 games for the celtics. If you guys hadnt made the trade Danny would have just picked Tatum at 1 and that situation rounds out to be pretty much the same.
"&gt;that Romeo Langford has higher potential than Jaylen Brown just one of the dumbest takes I've ever seen.  You talking about C's fan or r/NBA, because I guarantee you there's only a few handful of people I know, and some C's fan on our sub who actually think that, but I won't @ them lol. I still think Langford has good potential, but people hype him up so much. Just let the dude live and develop jeez."
"Celtics had the King's 2019 1st Round Pick *unprotected* and Ainge held on to it thinking it would be a #1 overall. It ended up being #14 and the Celtics were able to select Romeo Langford in what ended up being an overall very top-heavy draft with only Thybulle, Claxton, Horton-Tucker, Terrance Mann, and Paschall getting real play time in spots below #14.   Even 1 or 2 spots up and Boston could have had a starter or very very solid young Role Player.  Pretty hilarious considering that the origin of the pick was an absolute FLEECING by Philly. Taking on some bad contracts and Nik Stauskus for the 2019 1st.   Then Philly basically got to select Markelle Fultz by swapping picks with Boston with the bonus of this King's pick.   It's kind of funny the way they all ended up. I can't really say anyone destroyed each other with all these crazy trades and I'd only say Boston is the winner because they ended up with Tatum."
Romeo Langford is a lower tier most improved candidate (from 0 to solid and consistent enough bench contributor)
"You’ll note I didn’t comment on Langford at all because I don’t know him as a player particularly well. I’m pointing out that the commenter I’m replying to using Cam’s regular season games this season as representative of his ability as a player is silly. They mention the team being 10-16 with Cam playing, and 31-15 without him, not mentioning that that is the same stretch where the hawks in general were shitting the bed, specifically the stretch to start the season where we were still being coached by Lloyd Pierce.  I don’t really know Romeo, but to say Cam Reddish isn’t a solid rotational player is silly and stinks of someone who doesn’t actually pay much attention to the hawks"
"Actually you are wrong about high school, and you dont recall correctly, but I digress. Its true shooting isn't why he was drafted in the lottery to begin with, it was his defensive capability that was so touted. The hope was that he could eventually learn more offensive skills a la kawhi or Paul george. Again, going back to the playoffs, hawks don't dominate the bucks as soundly as they did game 4 if not for cam reddish leading the charge off the bench, and haeks probably get blown out by 30 if not for cam reddish dropping 21  The fact he shot as well as he did may end up being a flash in the pan sure, but this guy is going into his 3rd season next year. He has a ton of time to improve, and he performed at the highest level where it matters most. What the fuck has Romeo Langford done in the NBA that even compares to reddish?  I'm not even a hawks fan and I can see reddish has a future in this league while langford could be out as soon as his contract expires. I'm beginning to think its just pride making you sustain this argument that.cam reddish is shit when he clearly isnt"
"And that pick ended up being... Romeo Langford, who isn't really an NBA player yet"
Have you seen the Lakers drafting? I mean Pritchard averaged 9 points per game in his rookie season and Nesmith made a big impact as a rookie. They’re both more than good enough to be on the short list. I believe Romeo Langford will be on the shortlist as well soon.
"Yeah I think it’s much easier to build around and win with Brown and Tatum than it is with Trae and Collins. With another true star besides Trae I’ll look at them in a different light.   And I don’t really know about The Celtics but them being frauds was never really something people said. We didn’t have Jaylen in the playoffs and he’s crucial to the teams success. Assuming that Brown is back next year and him and Tatum both take another leap I see the Celtics being an extremely talented team. Replacing Kemba with Horford is a great decision as well and the Celtics have the 5th youngest roster in the league. With more development to key players like Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and hopefully the addition of last year’s draft and stash Yam Madar the team should take a big step forward."
I watched Romeo Langford for a year at IU. He’s a bum. I felt sorry for Celtics fans when he was drafted. He’s talented but just doesn’t care about basketball.
Romeo Langford will break out in a Mikal bridges type role.
"Tyrese Halliburton, Isaiah Stewart, Romeo Langford"
I think that’s one of those “stat guy things I could believe but never looked like it IRL” things  Edit: https://www.crimsonquarry.com/2019/6/7/18654836/2019-nba-draft-profile-romeo-langford-indiana-university-hoosiers  Interesting!  Still seems like they think he’s limited too.  Indiana did not have much talent to maximize any passing game for him tbf.
Romeo Langford will average 15-17 points per game winning MIP.
"Yep, that became Romeo Langford."
14. We got Romeo Langford with the pick. It was a Kings pick the one year they weren't terrible. When Joerger got them close to the 8th seed and Buddy looked legit. We get the 14th and then they go back to total shit the next season.
"Philly receives: #1 pick in the 2017 draft  Celtics receive: #3 pick in the 2017 draft + 2018 Lakers pick (which Sixers owned) if it falls between 2-5. If the Lakers pick does not convey, the Celtics get the more favorable of the Kings pick (which Philly owned) or the Sixers pick in the 2019 draft (unless one of them becomes the #1 overall pick, in which case the Celtics get the less favorable). In the end, it turned into the #14 pick in 2019, which was Romeo Langford."
"They didn’t trade (or own) a BKN pick, it was a protected LAL/SAC pick that turned into the #14 pick in 2019, Romeo Langford.   Anyways, I don’t know what reason exists to believe Hinkie wouldn’t have traded up for Fultz other than the way that some people see him as a mythical figure that can’t make mistakes.   At the time, it seemed like the perfect move - Fultz projected to be the perfect player to fit the Sixers and was the consensus best talent in the draft to boot. Being able to consolidate draft capital to move up at the top of the draft is almost never possible, and definitely jives with the process’ goal of acquiring as many assets as possible and then making plays for generational talents.   Fultz just wasn’t what people thought he was, but idk how anyone can possibly assume Hinkie would have known that/would have known he’d be available at 3."
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn’t move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn’t move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That’s a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn’t work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
Romeo Langford is the real untouchable player. His 3 PPG is just too good
Get Romeo Langford the fuck out of there  Replace him with a fucking first or something
Al horford Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford
Romeo Langford
"might have to include Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards &amp; Semi Ojeleye, too"
"""If the Clippers lose, would they take Romeo Langford, Marcus Smart, and Grant Williams for Paul George?"""
Yeah big year for him. Romeo Langford too.  This is a big time money year cause if he can't play it'll cost him millions.
Romeo Langford. Fans act like he is a lock to be a great player and if he was traded it would return something huge. The dude’s value is less than the pick he was taken with and is much more promising as a developing player as no team out there would think much of him at all.
"He's untouchable from an asset standpoint even more than being a 24 year old All-Star 25 PPG scoring wing. We are not in a great cap situation even after the Kemba trade, we have SOME flexibility, but losing Jaylen at 25 Mil and replacing him with Lillard means that one of Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, or Grant Williams is now a starter, and there isn't really a ton we can do about it. If we don't re-sign Fournier  and we also trade JB, our wing depth (which is already not good) is totally fucked. I realize I'm comparing a bunch of pieces to a top 10 player, but I think losing JB would make it incredibly hard to put an actually dangerous team around Lillard and Tatum.   I doubt the Celtics are in on that if it requires Brown, and I don't think we can put together anything good enough without him. r/bostonceltics is OBSESSED with the Beal/Tatum St. Louis connection, but the same thing applies there as well. Just doesn't seem realistic."
No. He tore his wrist and had surgery on it like Bojan Bogdanovic and Romeo Langford the last two seasons.
Not to mention our bench players literally have zero value. People on our sub think Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are legit tradable pieces.
"&gt;	Dame is out. Enjoy watching Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford &amp; Carsen Edwards the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Gordon Hayward, Cody Zeller, Mike Conley.  wished greg oden would've panned out. had to google some other ones. not many ""stars"", but Romeo langford and carsen edwards are some younger players  Edit: Forgot Eric Gordon and George Hill!"
"trading markelle fultz for romeo langford, and throwing in jayson tatum."
Yeah dude Romeo Langford and Tristan Thompson are gems….       /s
"Lol it was almost 1 to 1 the same trade, if Romeo Langford is a solid starter, its the best of his career imo  Maxwell was also involved in a glorious trade when Red dealt him for Bill Walton, who was the final piece for '86"
"Yeah he’s a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
"The only consequence that trade had was us ending up with Romeo Langford (who has barely done anything). The Celtics were always going to end up with Tatum, the Sixers with one of Fultz/Ball"
Will he settle for a Romeo Langford?
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner. That said, here's that data:  &amp;#x200B;  |(1) Kevin Huerter|Maryland|139 pts (12 games)| |:-|:-|:-| |(2) Tim Hardaway Jr.|Michigan |119 pts (7 games)| |(T3) Bryn Forbes|Michigan State|92 pts (11 games)| |(T3) Mike Conley|Ohio State|92 pts (6 games)| |(5) Jaren Jackson Jr.|Michigan State|68 pts (5 games)| |(T6) Kendrick Nunn|Illinois|41 pts (4 games)| |(T6) Duncan Robinson|Michigan|41 pts (4 games)| |(8) Romeo Langford|Indiana|36 pts (4 games)| |(9) Alex Len|Maryland|20 pts (5 games)| |(10) E'Twaun Moore|Purdue|11 pts (3 games)| |(11) Frank Kaminsky|Wisconsin|10 pts (6 games)| |(T12) Amir Coffey|Minnesota|5 pts (7 games)| |(T12) Carsen Edwards|Purdue|5 pts (2 games)| |(14) Daniel Oturu|Minnesota|4 pts (5 games)| |(15) Jalen Smith|Maryland|3 pts (3 games)| |(T16) Yogi Ferrell|Indiana|2 pts (6 games)| |(T16) Bruno Fernando|Maryland|2 pts (2 games)| |(T16) Cassius Winston|Michigan State|2 pts (1 game)| |(T16) Xavier Tillman Sr.|Michigan State|2 pts (3 games)| |(20) Trey Burke|Michigan |1 pt (2 games)|"
"Markelle Fultz:  June 19, 2017: Traded by the Boston Celtics **(as a future 2017 1st round draft pick)** to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected). (Future 1st-Rd pick will either be LAL's 2018 pick if it falls between 2 &amp; 5, or the better of PHI &amp; SAC's 2019 picks, unless it is the #1 pick)"
 A clone of Romeo Langford would do it too
"Romeo Langford for Ayton, who says no?"
Well Danny Ainge was the cheapest GM I’ve ever seen. He would probably call off a deal for Luka because he didn’t want to give up Romeo Langford
You want another project like Romeo Langford? No #16 is going to fill the team’s immediate needs. They have plenty of past picks that are still developing.
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"Depends how much Fournier signs for.  Also depends on the final cap number.  I assume the Celtics will pick up the options on guys like Romeo and Grant.  Between everything, they should have about 20-24m to work with while still retaining max cap space.  Williams hold is only 11m.  So if Fournier isn't on a multi, they could keep Williams and everyone else on a rookie contract and retain max space.  It would require renouncing Smart though.  If the free agent is good enough,,, Brown, Tatum, Williams, Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Williams, Brown, Max FA, non-tax MLE signing, 2022 rookie, minimum contracts to fill out roster should be a contender.  Rather than dancing around the cap, I think convincing one of the star FAs to sign in Boston would be the much harder task."
And I’ll trade you Romeo Langford for Luka if we’re doing things that won’t happen
I wouldn’t say the last 2 drafts were bad just a lot of injuries.  2018 Robert Williams is a stud and actually leads the draft class in ws/48 not a great stat but shows his effectiveness when he does play   2019 Romeo Langford again has dealt with injuries but looked good when he has been able to play. Grant Williams isn’t great but for 22 pick he isn’t bad. You really can’t look at second round picks they are hit or miss shot in the dark.
"Wrong draft, Bagley was 2nd pick in 2018. Kings were in the lottery in 2019 but Celtics had their pick and drafted Romeo Langford at 14, the last spot in the lottery."
"I kind of feel the same way about Boston trading down for Tatum  Look, you do that trade 10/10 times to get the extra asset but it's not that extra asset (Romeo Langford) has come to anything right now"
"You're gonna act like the Kemba trade scenarios aren't complete homer nonsense, and that our sub overvalues Romeo and Nesmith in those deals?  We don't want Kemba, he's an overrated, broken down volume scorer who can't even play 50% of a season or suit up in the playoffs, but LAC will give us Rondo, Kennard and Zubac for him and a 2nd? Our sub is completely insane to think we can trade Kemba without giving up one or more of our young guys, but any time Langford gets mentioned, it's ""too much""."
Romeo Langford averages 400 points per game on 110% shooting
"Seriously, we were down an All-Star the entire series, and we lost two more starters halfway through. We had to start *Romeo Langford* in games 4 and 5."
"Celtics have a good chance I think. Their season this year was really, really fucked up by injuries, and both Jay's seemed to take a jump. The injuries were so rough that Romeo Langford (played 57 games before this years playoffs) was starting for them against Brooklyn - his career average is 2.7 points per game."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"&gt; Because it shows he's a good evaluator of talent? &gt;  &gt;   Sure, I think he's done a good job of identifying talent, but to be successful you need to identify talent and accrue benefits from that talent.    Take for instance someone like Romeo Lanford vs Payton Pritchard. It's possible that Romeo ends up a better player at the end than Romeo Langford (I personally don't think it's overly likely, but for the hypothetical lets imagine it). If Romeo finally takes that leap in year 4, but then requires a large contract that then either puts his salary at par or above the caliber of his play, the Celtics never really accrue much value over what it cost them for that player. Compared to someone like Pritchard who likely will give them 4 years of play above his salary level.    That's where the disconnect is on someone like Rozier. He wasn't a good player for us for most of his tenure here, and then we balked at paying him $19M APY on his next contract. That window for us to accrue value from Rozier never really opened outside of a very small window his 3rd year. We also invested a lot of time in him before he was a replacement level player.    Danny was able to identify a talented player, but it didn't serve the Celtics all that well because it took him too long for the team to be able to utilize that talent. That's an important factor in evaluating drafting."
"I agree with the first part, but the 50% part in 11-30 I disagree with.  Since 2011 he drafted  MarShon Brooks at 25, Jared Sullinger at 21, Fab Melo at 22, James Young at 17, Terry Rozier at 16, RJ Hunter at 28, Yabusele at 16, Ante Zizec at 23, Rob Williams at 27, Romeo Langford at 14, Grant Williams at 22, Nesmith at 14, And Pritchard at 26  Of those 13, I think it’s fair to say only Rozier, Rob Williams and Pritchard have been great picks, with the potential for Nesmith to join them if he plays more like he did this summer league than last season.   Grant Williams and Langford have not looked good, but are still in the league, with Langford having more upside than Williams."
"Romeo Langford, RJ Hunter, James Young, and Yabusele up next for the Max? 😀"
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."
"Celtics summer league was overall pretty good despite the embarrassing loss in the final. I’d say  our most disappoint players were Romeo Langford, who didn’t showcase any of the facilitating skills we were hoping to see from him, and Carsen Edwards, who still hasn’t shown he can be anything other than a volume shooter. Honorable mention Yam Madar who disappeared after the first game and was a lot less productive than we were hoping after playing a year overseas."
"This is pretty close to what you are asking for. Romeo Langford of the Celtics and WR Rondale Moore (2nd round pick for the Arizona Cardinals) out of Purdue grew up 5 houses apart in New Albany, Indiana and are essentially best friends.  https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2018/12/18/ius-romeo-langford-purdues-rondale-moore-were-buddies-new-albany/2335083002/"
Romeo Langford exists
"Tyrese Haliburton  Wendell Carter Jr.  Deni Avidja  As a Celtics fan... Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford and Payton Pritchard  I still believe in Markelle Fultz... he won't ever be a superstar in the strictest sense of the word or the best player in his draft class but he has a Jrue Holiday type ceiling  Jamal Murray I think his ceiling is a lot higher than probably most people think. I wanted the Celtics to draft him 3rd in his draft"
Romeo Langford.
Romeo Langford.
Romeo Langford
"Celtics will be a fun team with a lot to prove. They had a disappointing season last year going .500, being forced into the play-in, and then getting gentleman’s swept in the first round.    Tatum is clearly a star, but he hasn’t broken into “top 5” players in the league territory which he believes he is. Coming off a gold medal, this is his season to prove he should be in that top 5 conversation.    Schroder passed up $84 mil to sign for $5 mil and wants to prove he’s worth a big contract after this season. Look for him to ball out.    They also have a bunch of former first round picks who have shown potential but haven’t established themselves in the league yet. Guys like Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, and Aaron Nesmith will get a chance to show what they’ve got.     They also have a new coach in Ime Udoka who’s never been a head coach before and wants to prove he belongs."
"Lmao, I noticed your username and I was like “yo good for the Romeo Langford stan, got himself some serious karma”"
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
Romeo Langford and Juhann Begarin are smoov
"Dude used to throw down massive dunks when I saw him play in high school, in packed Indiana High gyms, very hype  Edit: also Me 6’3 white dude with maybe 25 inch vertical played as “Romeo Langford” for scout team"
&gt; He says that a lot of those guys weren't the best on their teams in elementary/middle school   You can start to tell once people hit their growth spurts. Romeo Langford went to my rival middle/high school and by 7th grade he was dominant and people were talking NBA potential.
"Cam Reddish, Nassir Little, Romeo Langford are a couple from the last few years."
"Ultimately, as a result of trading Pierce, Garnett, Jason Terry, and DJ White, the Celtics have gotten:  * Marcus Smart 6th overall in the 2014 draft (this was the Celtics' own pick, but it is unlikely they would've been drafting 6th if they kept their core)  * Jaylen Brown (pick from Nets)  * Jayson Tatum (pick from Nets, traded to 76ers for 3rd overall pick and 2019 15th overall pick)  *  2018 8th overall pick Colin Sexton (traded to Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving)  * Romeo Langford  The ***only*** thing I fault Ainge for and felt was completely boneheaded in the moment was giving an aging undersized guard a 4 year $141M contract.  Other than that, I can't really think of anything he did wrong.  Hayward was an awful contract but at the time of the signing it seemed great.  And I don't put much stock into ""rumors"" that don't pan out, because none of us are in these front offices, and I would bet that over 80% of NBA rumors are complete BS made up either by reporters or GMs just as a smokescreen."
So does Yam Madar and Romeo Langford
Romeo langford
"Big deal. The Celtics will do that too when they play the Yam Mader, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Robert Williams lineup."
"Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, maybe a pick"
"After disappointing seasons with their respective co-stars, AD, KD, and Kawhi all demand trades to the Celtics for Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Romeo Langford, respectively. After all these years, Ainge finally gets his guy(s).  ...also we still trade Horford for Beal because why not"
"This is going to be Romeo Langford first offseason healthy, so I'm excited to see what he can do."
Romeo Langford - a threat at PG soon
"In terms of a player I think might have star potential that doesn’t get talked about a lot, ( or at Least enough ) is Keldon Johnson, watch out for a breakout year from him. I’m also a big fan of Timothé luwawu-cabarrot, I think he’ll be a more regular rotation guy in a couple years. One more being Romeo Langford, he’s already a very good defender and a not too bad finisher, and this offseason was the first one where he wasn’t just rehabbing an injury, so maybe he’ll improve this offseason, get his jump shot back, and have a pretty solid role on a playoff team."
i would take romeo langford for bamba
Depends on the price.   For Marcus Smart? No.  For Romeo Langford? Sure.
Romeo Langford he has to show something this year he's been injured and underwhelming his first two years.
Romeo Langford
"Get out of here, Celtics Romeo Langford and even more so, Aaron Nesmith going to dominate this yr.  That's with smart, Tatum and brown.  Timelord, horford, and kanter not too too bad, either.  Knicks are grasping, Celtics have developed.  See you in June, and with $ to spare."
"It's a good take, and the reasoning is there; they spent the entire season playing basketball as a team/plague ward. They won a game against the Nets in the playoffs with 27 minutes from Romeo Langford, a player who might not even exist."
Could I have [BOS] Romeo Langford flair?
"Celtics fan here. According to Frankievision on Instagram we are a super team because we currently have Romeo Langford rostered. So yeah, I guess you guys are in the same breath as us"
"Tatum and Brown are both young stars. Rob Williams, Payton Prichard, Romeo Langford, Aaron Neismith will all get minutes, hell smart richardson and Dunn are all 27, the only old guy on their team is horford."
"You'd have to give up Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and a protected first."
Last year's 14th pick was Aaron Neesmith. The year before it was Romeo Langford lol.
"As soon as next summer, really. They can put all their eggs in the Beal basket (which I’m still not sure is the right choice), or they can add actual quality depth all around the edges rather than having to play Grant Williams Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford big minutes"
do you say Halliburton to Boston for Tristan Thompson and Romeo Langford?
Celtics sub: [does Romeo Langford even exist?](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/m2bebq/does_romeo_langford_even_exist/)
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now
yeah and Celtics fans love Romeo Langford because of the Fultz trade  ...wait
Romeo Langford ??!?!!?!?!?!
"That trade actually ended up working out as well as possible for us. We were still able to trade Belinelli for the #22 pick in the next draft, and ended up with Fox from the Tatum draft. We also lost pick #14 in 2019 (ended up being Romeo Langford). It was a terrible trade, but it could have played out sooo much worse than it did."
This team could've used Romeo Langford.
He can’t be any worse than Romeo Langford or Semi Ojeleye or Jabari Parker
I’m addicted to Romeo Langford
"Boston trades: Markelle Fultz  Boston receives: Jayson Tatum, Romeo Langford and Markelle Fultz"
"bro come the fuck on. Jesus the Celtics are so absolutely fucked, gonna go pray that Romeo Langford and Grant Williams can be legit rotation players"
"&gt;The Sixers asked for Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, former lottery picks Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Celtics quickly turned down the offer.  This will be the next report. 5....4....3....2....1"
"Under normal circumstances I’d agree, but the C’s already have Romeo Langford so with all those guys I’d be worried there would be too many mouths to feed 🧐"
"Yup yup Romeo Langford, so on and so forth..."
How much value could Romeo Langford have in a trade? He's a throw in piece.
"I forgot about Williams, but he's about to be an RFA after this season anyway. And I can guarantee you teams around the league aren't trading a star player in the hopes of getting back Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith as the centerpieces. They have some value due to their age and contract but their worth is closer to a second-round pick at this point, I personally don't think they're moving the needle in a trade for someone of Beal's caliber"
How tf did Tatum get a roster spot over guys like Payton Pritchard and Romeo Langford???
How about two late firsts &amp; a slightly used Romeo Langford?
Romeo fucking Langford  Kid’s gonna be a beast next season
"I think that you missed Romeo Langford off your list. He was a big high school star, too!"
"Could've been 7th, but yall got torched by Romeo Langford for some reason"
Nic Claxton  Darius Garland  De’Andre Hunter  Daniel Gafford  Romeo Langford (just because I want it to happen)
"The package I saw was Smart, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, grant Williams and like 4 FRP and swaps. Definitely a solid package but it pretty much guts us and doesn’t give the Wiz a real building block player."
"This is still in the ""if"" phase, which it has been since literally the beginning of this past season. Also, the Wiz would be dumb to take any package they doesn't involve Jaylen Brown, which defeats the purpose. I'm still very skeptical this could actually happen even if Beal wanted it.   And before anyone says ""reeee Brooklyn!"", the Celtics don't have anywhere near the package of picks and young upside players that Brooklyn used in that deal. Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen are not Romeo Langford and Robert Williams."
Or how about Romeo langford + al horford and 4 1 st and maybe a bag of chips
You don't deserve much credit for beating the hospital Celtics in the 1st round because you were very efficient.  Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye actually started for them in the playoffs.
"I've been pretty open about not being a Romeo Langford fan since I watched him at IU, but I will admit that he was starting to look the part during the Nets-Celtics series.  I'm wishing him the best, the Celtics will need a ton out of both him and Nesmith this coming season in my opinion."
"Ah yes, the Romeo Langford experience"
"I know I know boo hoo, but the Celtics luck under the curse of Isaiah Thomas has been kind of crazy. Hayward's leg and subsequent injuries. Kyrie's... whatever the fuck that was that Kyrie did. Lottery picks from the basement-dwelling Kings and the Grizzlies turning into Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith instead of, like, Zion Williamson and Tyrese Haliburton. The worst 2020-2021 covid shitstorm in the league.  I can't be mad or anything, because we were probably the luckiest team in the league for the three years prior. Scary Terry almost took us to the finals for fuck's sake."
"Celtics fans are so used to busts by now, Carsen, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Sullinger, Guerschon, the list goes on"
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
Romeo Langford
Romeo Langford. I personally still have faith in him but much of the fanbase is pretty down on him.
\#1 is is Romeo Langford no doubt
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
How you got Celtics behind Hornets and Pacers? They were the seventh seed despite being more affected by Covid than any other team. They had Romeo Langford starting for them in the playoffs.
"I don't think he's saying the Celtics are going to retire the numbers of all of the current players.  He's just saying that for as long as like, Romeo Langford is on the team, the number 45 is not really available for another player to wear."
"i think the biggest problem is they've lacked any real consistency, especially outside of Jaylen Brown and Tatum.  in 2020 Hayward and Kemba got big minutes and a ton of shot attempts when they played, but they could not be at all relied on to play regularly.  Kemba was the same way last year to an even worse degree.  due to injuries and covid, the celtics have had a bunch of lineups where the second best scorer/ball handler is marcus smart, who really shouldn't be a top-2 option on offense (i love him but that's not playing to his strengths).  and if its not him, its probably someone way worse/more inexperienced like brad wannamaker or romeo langford.  i think if they can just get consistency from their role players they can actually start to run a real offensive system, which they haven't really had in years.  in terms of personnel, this is the best i've felt about a celtics roster since they traded for Kyrie and signed Hayward (but before Hayward broke his leg)."
"Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 unprotected firsts, plus salary filler"
"You know a lot of people talk about that trade and yeah, if you're able to make that move from Boston's perspective you do that trade 10 times out of 10, but that trade didn't really amount to much.  That Sacramento pick had a lot more speculative value than actual value (same with their Memphis pick). It turned into Romeo Langford who's one of the weaker lottery picks from his draft class."
"May I interest you in getting a reliable back up in Al Horford + two amazing young players (incredible upside) - Grant Williams and Romeo Langford, for Ben Simmons? Definitely a fair trade, just trust me on this."
"May I interest you in getting a reliable back up in Al Horford + two amazing young players (incredible upside) - Grant Williams and Romeo Langford, for Ben Simmons? Definitely a fair trade, just trust me on this."
My offer is romeo langford and carsen edwards for simmons. I can promise both of these players are better shooters than him
"I don't get why people are so out on him. He's a late first round pick who showed real promise in the 2020 playoffs as a defensive role player, yeah he sucked last year but he's certainly shown more potential to be a contributor than, like, Romeo Langford (though I'm not all the way out on him either, but at least Grant can stay on the *floor*)."
Also Romeo Langford
Romeo Langford
"fine, [I wouldn't trade Romeo Langford for Ben Simmons straight up](https://imgur.com/gallery/KqYWYsv)"
Romeo Langford.
Seen a Celtics fan say that they should trade Evan Fournier and Romeo Langford for dame but that’s nothing compared Lakers fans
1. Romeo Langford will be an above average bench player this season.  2. Kyle Kuzma will be a consistent 15-20 ppg scorer with the Wizards.
Romeo Langford.
Can I interest you in one lightly used Romeo Langford?
"The Celtics are significantly more deep than last year, hopefully will be fully healthy, and Tatum + Brown as your two best players has proven to be a conference finals team in years past. They have Schroeder, Smart, Horford, JRich, PP, Timelord and potential in Nesmith becoming a reliable rotation player plus guys like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford who tend to make good decisions and can give you quality minutes. They also brought back Kanter who is a body for them when they have to go up against bigger centers. Idk how you can say they don’t have depth when they’re 10 deep of legitimate players.   I’d agree on the coaching change but I think the Celtics have always been a defensive and scrappy/edgy team which is all I’ve heard coming out of Ime’s mouth so I don’t think the handoff will be as hard as outlined above + Tatum got to work with him in Tokyo.   Philly does have an MVP candidate in Embiid but who’s to say Tatum doesn’t ascend to an MVP candidate this year? And who’s to say Tatum + Brown is inferior to Embiid + Simmons?   As for the hawks, they honestly remind me of the 2018 Celtics and I think they are a really good team but they don’t have any obvious answers for containing Tatum or Brown and we have a fully switchable defense that should be able to contain Trae while staying honest on their shooters. I might argue the Hawks are better than the 76ers though.    Lastly, I will believe Philly is better than Boston when they beat them in a playoff series."
"I'm just wondering - how much better is the current Sixers team than the version from the 2020 bubble?  How much worse is the current Celtics team than the version from the 2020 bubble?  Personally I feel like the Sixers are about the same (although they lost Simmons in those Bubble playoffs which hurt them), but the Celtics should be better.  Tatum/Brown have developed more, and then you would expect at least SOME of the guys like Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Pritchard, and Grant Williams to take a step forward.  Add in solid-to-great role players in Schroder, Smart, Richardson, and Horford; the addition-by-subtraction of Kemba (if he could get out of street clothes, he was good on occasion but was too regularly terrible and just took the ball out of other guy's hands), and I don't see how this Celtics team is worse.  I think this season is gonna surprise a lot of people, not just the Boston Celtics.  People are looking at the results of the 2021 season and think the landscape of the NBA have changed a ton since the 2020 season.  But I really think 2021 is a huge outlier due to all of the nonsense caused by COVID.  There is a lot of noise in that data to try to draw any real conclusions from it."
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
"Isn't that the pick that came to us in the Tatum trade? If so, Romeo Langford."
They were both 14 in their respective drafts.  1 was Romeo Langford. And I can't even remember the other guy.
"2017: Sacramento loses out on Jayson Tatum, selects De'Aaron Fox (albeit in a timeline where Sacramento has their first Boston probably selects Tatum #1 and Sacramento still takes Fox or even Markelle Fultz)  2019: Boston selects Romeo Langford  Honestly as far as bad trades go, they got off pretty easy."
didn't think I'd be missing Romeo Langford by game four but here I am.
It ended up being Romeo Langford
"Curious to see what percentage of the turnover nightmare in the Raps game will be our running average.   Like you say, the talent’s there and the fit’s weird. In fact, I think we’re vastly deeper than last year, but that depth is only effective on defense without motion in the offense. Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith can both ball, now, but both in a way that’s very redundant with Tatum and Brown; Schröder and Richardson are both fine rotation players, but again we’d be infinitely better off if one was prime JJ Barea, or Jalen Brunson.  Good read."
Don’t sleep on Romeo Langford.  20 year old.
1. Romeo Langford.  2. Aaron Nesmith.  3. Robert Williams.  4. Jordan Poole.  5. Terrence Mann.  6. Jordan Nwora.  7. Isaiah Joe.  8. Mikal Bridges.  9. OG Anunoby.  10. Tyrese Haliburton.
Romeo Langford
And Romeo Langford. I swear whenever he plays for two weeks in a row he starts looking great then he promptly gets hurt.
"Not as good of a player, but this is how I feel about Romeo Langford. High potential, but hadn’t really had a summer to prep for a season due to injury and the COVId season prior to this year.   He looks like he’s taken a huge leap."
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
ok would u rather have lebron or romeo langford. what's ur answer?
Romeo Langford 30 piece mcnugget inbound
"Romeo Langford is low-key the best interview on the whole team. Jayson, Jaylen, Marcus, Al, etc. never say anything. I remember one time Romeo was asked something like ""how was practice"" and he gave a full 5 minute breakdown of everything they worked on."
&gt;Ask any Celtics fan and this guy is a better version of Capela.  Yeah and Romeo Langford is the second coming of Dwade if you ask Celtics fans.
"I agree re: the 08 Celtics and Rondo (and even a guy like Kendrick Perkins for that matter, he was a underrated young piece that the title team relied on, started every game that season). But honestly, a case can be made that the Celtics in recent years did exactly what Draymond is saying. They never committed fully to either path, and they suffered a little in terms of contention and in terms of player growth.   They had a bunch of mid first round picks that they didn’t trade to acquire more talent and depth when they had Isaiah and Horford, or later with Kyrie Hayward and Horford and the Jays.   But in keeping those picks, they also didn’t have much room for them to play. Guys like Yabusele, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, etc didn’t get a ton of reps because the team couldn’t afford to lose games trying to develop them. Now several seasons later and Yabu is long gone, Romeo’s future looks unclear, and Grant Williams is still way too hit or miss. That’s 3 first round picks!! If you’re keeping the picks, you damn well need to have a way to develop them on the court. Or else what’s the point…might as well have moved them for more NBA ready talent when the team was closer to contention.   Now they’re in the middle and with no clear way to improve. The picks are all used up. The experienced vet stars have all moved on/gotten washed up. By trying to contend and develop, they ended up accomplishing neither."
I people on r/bostonceltics say that Romeo Langford should be our starting SG so think that might prove your point
"Yeah, exactly! Like, if you want to say that Trae is better because his volume playmaking makes up for the difference in their defense, I think that's a perfectly valid argument, and it's a reasonable conversation to have. If the article were making *that* argument, instead of just going ""Trae has the 'it' factor over Tatum"" (because Tatum couldn't make it past the fully healthy Nets with *Romeo Langford and Tristan Thompson* starting games for the Celtics), I wouldn't be yelling about it."
"I know Boston fans love to bring up that move time and time again, but both that Sac pick and that Memphis pick from the Jeff Green trade ended up having a lot more speculative value than actual value.  Does Boston take that trade 10/10 times? Yes, but it's not like Romeo Langford has made a huge splash in the league."
"I agree the Cs could be a good fit. They don’t have too much in the way of young talent other than the Jays, but maybe something like Robert Williams, Romeo Langford, Dennis Schroeder, and a 1st? Schroeder is only on a 1-year deal, Langford has a team option that I imagine the Rockets would be happy to decline, and Williams is still young with good potential. The money works at least I think."
"It's a bit of both. With that being said we have a few guys like Smart, Tatum, Nesmith, Pritchard, and Al Horford who are mired in big shooting slumps. On the flip side we have a couple of guys like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford who are shooting better than their profile. We suck at shooting in aggregate, but we're also shooting worse than we probably should be."
Romeo langford is good at defense
Nah our biggest issue is that everyone on the team not named Grant Williams or Romeo Langford is shooting like 10% below their career 3pt%. And we weren’t a great shooting team to begin with.
Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford being in the rotation is what really seals the Celtics' fate in mediocrity
romeo langford has no value lmfao boston fans are the only people who care about him
"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"
There’s nothing more frustrating and annoying as watching Romeo Langford on the floor. He is so useless.
"Never forget Romeo ""Started two games against the Brooklyn Nets in the 2020-21 Playoffs"" Langford."
"Yeah you're right. Romeo Langford might become the GOAT. Bruno Fernando could become the next Kareem. You never know, right?"
he's salty the kings didn't trade him to the Celtics for Romeo Langford and a top 55 protected 2nd rounder
"Unbiased opinion: Kuminga Biased opinion: Romeo Langford if he can stay healthy (lol) and be more confident on offense, mainly not passing up opportunities to score and being stronger in his drives like he was in college"
Not lebrons fault romeo langford can easily lock him up. That's just the way things are sometimes
bron getting beat off the dribble by romeo langford and only taking jumpers
Brad Stevens keeping Romeo Langford on the team is proof he's going to be as overrated as an executive as he was as a coach
Marcus Smart +  Josh Richardson + Romeo Langford  Those are some of the top 30(0) players in the NBA
The Celtics' center play isn't the issue. Centers are the only bright spot of the team. They need shooting badly. tatum is in a career worst slump and smart/schroder/richardson is the worst shooting backcourt rotation in the league not to mention Horford's also in a slump going from 37% to 21% from 3 this season. Our best shooters this season has been Jaylen (good) and fuckin Romeo Langford which shows where the celtics' issues are
"Be easy on this person. Last I checked, they were expecting glory for Romeo Langford because he was ""the best college finisher ever."""
So sad that Romeo Langford is getting more playing time than Aaron Nesmith
"Romeo Langford, not even close. Your team literally didn't start a PG at the beginning of the year, laughable decision"
"If Boston wins this we claim the letter B and Bucks have to trade us three players of our choice as compensation (we will take Giannis, Middleton, and Holiday in exchange for Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Romeo Langford)."
"Yup, Sixers are doomed for not accepting a trade for Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford"
"Romeo Langford is currently really close. Although I don't know the minimal requirements, and I don't think he meets them, especially with his negligible FT attempts, but he's averaging:  .471/.500/1.000 on 4.9/2.6/0.3 attempts per game  Do I expect this to last, haha no. But I'm a homer and will beat the drum for my guy.  Edit: he doesn't meet it, had to reword my post."
"If you're the Celtics you're hoping Romeo ""Out"" Langford has a breakout game within the next 2 weeks. Otherwise what are you really doing with this guy?"
"&gt;Would I trace Vucevic for that package? Sure I would.  Youd trade Vooch for more than you paid for him? Crazy!  I do enjoy how youre using his past like it has any bearing on that trade, especially accolades. The mother load of potential? Bro If you're all about potential I have one Romeo Langford, he was a FRP and is just oozing with potential. Grant Williams won the SEC player of the year, so that means his potential must be CrAzY!  Imagine thinking youre going to get a top 20 player in the league for Ben Simmons. Talk about delusional"
"2 PM: Ben Simmons announces he's returning to the team, is delighted to be a 76er, and wants to win a title in Philly.  3 PM: Shams reveals that the reason Simmons is staying is that the 76ers are catering to his demands, building the team around him, and are finalizing a trade of Joel Embiid for Jaylen Brown, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and a 1st round pick."
Romeo Langford +25
"He's definitely been streaky.   When he's good he's game-changingly good. He led the league in 3P% for a month last season while also out-hustling Marcus Smart.  When he's bad, he pretty much forces his way into DNPs.  We're hoping he can stablise because he's got a lot of potential if he does.  Health hasn't been a huge factor outside of missing some time in college (and pre-draft), that's more Romeo Langford (who also had a nice night against Miami)."
Romeo Langford 3-5 10 pts +27  Tyler Herro 0-4 4 pts -32
Broke: Celtics could have had Tyler Herro but instead have Romeo Langford and the Celtics look awful while the Heat look great to start the season  Woke: I have Bam and Herro in fantasy
Maybe he just got fatter since he said that or his foot got worse.  The only reason this is even that big of a deal is because it's Zion and not like Romeo Langford.
"Wait, you don’t think Romeo Langford is going to average 30/8/7 next season smh"
I could watch through the Pitino days because I was too young to care how bad they were. I loved Pierce and 'Toine. But I'm too old to be watching this trash team or talking to all the delusional Celtics fans who think Romeo Langford is a future superstar.
They have fucking Romeo Langford and Al Hortford playing next to them of course the team will suck
"Romeo Langford (been told high ceiling, will be 20ppg guy with good defense) for Simmons"
The refs are the reason that Romeo Langford hasn’t lived up to Boston fan’s weird expectations of him?
Romeo Langford isn’t a great Player yet but he was seen as a Scoring Guard with bad defense pre draft. He’s now a defensive guard with bad offense
"Yeah we have two all stars, but literally no supporting cast. It’s actually terrible. Jabari Parker is one of our key bench guys. Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are borderline starters. Marcus Smart is our 3rd best player, and we’re starting two big men who can’t shoot, one of whom is 36. You can say covid decimated us, but we also don’t have 3 of our 6 best players from last season, so it doesn’t necessarily translate to a better record. Throw on all that replacing a top 5-10 coach with a rookie, I don’t see how we should expect more than a couple wins better than last season."
"I think Romeo Langford can be a really solid player in the future. If cam reddish fixes his efficiency issues he will be a problem. Also JJJ, dude can be a beast"
"&gt; John Collins (S&amp;T with Atlanta), Vucevic, Julius Randle, Brogdon and yes, the possibility of KAT or Beal as well.    We won't be able to S&amp;T for John Collins because we're going to be way too close to the apron to execute the deal. Right now we have something like $10 million under the projected apron with 11 guys on the roster.    As far as the rest of those guys go, I'm not sure any of those guys put us over the top either, so going by that standard those trades don't really do much for us. Not to mention why would someone like Randle be available?   &gt; the Nets isn't a strong example, they had LeVert as the centerpiece of the deal (the Celtics do not have anything of that caliber to trade) and Jarrett Allen in addition to all those other picks.   I mean the Celtics would have Smart, Barnes, Timelord, Pritchard, whoever was left between Romeo/Langford, and after the draft probably our full cadre of picks. That's not all that far off what the basis was to put together a similar deal to what the Nets put together for Harden.    It's all dependent on what the Kings asking price is for Barnes, but barring something completely unreasonable he could very easily be a nice incremental upgrade for the team."
"The Celtics sub has preferred Barnes for months. I’m personally comfortable giving up 2 FRPs, one of Langford/Nesmith, and Grant Williams, but idk if the Kings do that. Also I really love Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith"
"he wasn't even one of the kids getting paid, he just bailed because his coach got the axe and he didn't want to have to go through the recruiting process again.  He was old enough that he could go straight to the league, so he said fuck it and skipped college.  Cost us Romeo Langford, Courtney Ramey, and Balsa Koprivica"
Looking forward to 2nd half of season getting to watch lamar stephens and romeo langford headline games for the next 2 months
I think you mean Romeo Langford
You're wrong.  The Celtics *only* have shit to offer them.  Like Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith!
"Ainge is the stingest gm in the league, hes gonna lowball the pistons, why would they want romeo langford and a first?"
What?  Pistons don't want Romeo Langford and a 1st?
"Danny Ainge ripping powder, throwing darts on a wall, and saying ""hes the one"" and offers romeo langford, Robert Williams and a couple second round picks for all stars and being surprised and he gets told no.  que next line.  ""we were close to making a deal, just didn't find the right one in time""  Right on Danny boy, right on."
"How does dumping Vucevic help us rebuild? We already have fultz, Cole, Isaac, Gordon, okeke, Bamba, and a likely top 5 pick. What's the incentive to trade Vucevic and Gordon for worse players? Is Romeo Langford and late draft picks going to help the development of Cole Anthony more than Vucevic?"
"Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, and a future 1st"
"“Despite mutual interest in a Vucevic deal, talks fell apart with Boston due to Romeo Langford being reportedly, “untouchable in the eyes of Ainge,” source says.”"
Have fun begging the Pistons to take Romeo Langford and two firsts for Jerami Grant lmao
What are they interested in giving up?  Romeo Langford and 2 protected future firsts?  Oh they aren’t actually interested in trading for them then
"Smart being injured for a long time is tough since he's a top 4 player on the team. Tatum also has made it clear that COVID has affected his conditioning. Kemba's knee has been an issue obviously.   Aside from that, (and more importantly, probably) I think the main issue is roster construction. It's not a team built to move the ball well, and that necessarily means that easy shots can be hard to come by. I mean I think Smart's the best passer on the team, so there you go. The bench is also pretty horrific. Teague is awful, Romeo Langford never plays, etc. etc."
"I think the TT acquisition was fine but that doesn't excuse poor roster construction.   I felt like I've had a few conversations with Celtics fans recently who've made the comment: ""Who could we have traded for?"". For the record I'm on board with not dumping one of the Jays/Smart in a rental. That's fine.  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
"To offer a somewhat serious reply - it's difficult to judge the recent picks too much. For one, 2nd round picks rarely ever pan out, and so there's no surprise guys like Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters aren't anything noteworthy (shoutout to Semi Ojeleye though, who's actually a contributor). And even first-rounders don't carry a high guarantee of success.  As for his first-round picks, Romeo Langford has been injured more than not, and that's never a good sign for any player's potential. But when he did play, it did look like he belonged in the league. Time will tell what becomes of him once he returns.  Speaking of time, Rob Williams is a pretty underrated prospect. Yeah he's already in his 3rd year and is 23, but he was always a project to begin with, and this year he's definitely shown a lot of improvement with his defense. His minutes aren't very high, but that's supposedly so his hip problem doesn't flare up too soon into the season. If he can put everything he has together, he'd definitely be outplaying his #27 draft selection.  Grant Williams is okay, it's hard to see him getting a 2nd contract at this point, but he looked better last year, so there's hope he can revert (his 3P% is up at least).  It's way too early to tell with Nesmith, but he's definitely not a James Young kind of player. His career will rely on being able to knock down 3s consistently.  As for Ainge getting better results from these draft picks - one could certainly argue for that. What was once a treasure trove of picks has now resulted in a lot of uncertainty. It didn't help that both the Kings and Grizzlies played above expectations (they were seen as surefire top 7 picks prior). But in order for him to sell those picks, there had to be buyers - and not a lot of buyers want late lottery/mid-20s picks and nothing else. Ainge was definitely targeting someone like Jrue Holiday, but the Bucks' offer was simply too much for him to match.  I do think it's unfortunate so many players left the C's without compensation, such as Horford, Irving, and Morris. Rozier and Hayward as well, sort of, though we'll see how that TPE and Kemba's knee turn out. I just think his draft assets - combined with the success of Tatum/Brown -  got way overhyped."
"To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him.

Not gonna mention Robert Williams or Romeo Langford?
"Romeo Langford, a first and second for Harrison Barnes"
"As soon as Romeo comes back, we'll have 5 players, who aren't starters but who all have clear potential and who all are under 22ish: Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Williams and Williams. The one upside to no longer being clear contenders: the East talent looks poor enough that we could yet still fall backwards into the playoffs, while trying to find out more about these guys. I know this is possibly crazy, but I even feel like we should shut Smart down if he won't come back 100%; no need to KD our best individual defender on a lost season.  So yeah, development year. If we moved one or even 2 of those players for a veteran, thats fine but wait til the offseason. I don't think we should buy at the deadline, we'd be dumb to trade assets at this point, for a 6th seed under .500"
"This team is not worth investing in. There is no trade available at the deadline that puts us in the same tier as Philly/Milwaukee/Brooklyn. JJ Redick? Harrison Barnes? Porzingis? None of them, even in the impossible scenario that we have the assets to make the trade, do not put us into the conversation of actually winning the East this year.  Our bench is garbage. Tatum and Brown are all stars but haven't figured out that thing where they make the TEAM better yet (only the Knicks and Wolves average fewer APG than the Celtics), Kemba is crawling around in the dark trying to find his shot again, and r/bostonceltics thinks Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford (who is a ghost) are going to fix what's going on right now. It's a mess. I'd much rather wait and use the massive TPE to blow this roster up in the off season than invest in this team."
"This isn’t true ands one of his picks that haven’t looked good we’re for reasons beyond what history shows. Yabosele and anti zizic both were drafted because they were going to spend another year overseas and they didn’t have the roster spot or money for them so it wasn’t as bad as they looked.   Also, more recently Robert Williams is showing a lot more promise and Romeo Langford has been dealing with injuries since coming into the league.  Bad luck is truly what has been killing them.  IT4 hip  Hayward’s ankle Kyrie’s knee Hayward’s injury in the playoffs last year Kemba’s knee"
"uh...what?  This is such a bad take.  The point is to build around Tatum and Brown, not move one of them.  If they had an actual NBA center last season, they beat the Heat - and maybe even the Lakers - and an actual NBA backup guard, not Wanamaker.  Those are 2 pieces that Ainge EASILY could have picked up last season  without breaking the bank or losing any real core pieces.  He has assembled 4 or 5 clowns in the draft that instead of building depth do nothing but take up spots on their bench.  Watch all the Celtic fans jump in and tell me about how great Romeo Langford is going to be..."
"The problem isn't that they didn't trade the picks, the problem is that they used the picks...on bad players, lol. So many bad picks: James Young, Guerschon Yabusele, Romeo Langford, etc."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
It's easy to shit on Covington for having a down year but yes when RoCo is rolling he's worth a decently-high first round pick like that.  He's especially worth it as a win-now contributor to the Jays. I'd rather have a down RoCo then waiting 4 years to gamble on whether or not Romeo Langford becomes an actual player.
"&gt;miss used so many of their   I think people are looking to clown DA...but it’s not like he let his war chest evaporate w nothing to show for it.  * BOS 2014 1st, tanking year: Marcus Smart  * BKN 2014 1st: James Young  * BKN 2016 1st: Jaylen Brown  * BKN 2017 1st: Jayson Tatum  * BKN 2018 1st: traded for Kyrie Irving  * SAC 2019 1st: Romeo Langford  * MEM 2020 1st: Aaron Nesmith  Langford/Nesmith are incomplete. Jays + Marcus are hits. James Young (at #17) was an obvious whiff, and you could make an argument that the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie."
Celtics fans begging the Kings to offload Harrison Barnes for Romeo Langford and 2 firsts rn
Celtics fans begging the Kings to offload Harrison Barnes for Romeo Langford and 2 firsts rn
"It's complicated because to be honest, we're not a bad team on paper when healthy. The reason we always seem to get off to a hot start and then suddenly cool off is because all of a sudden our rotation gets decimated. We've just had shit luck in regards to freak injuries for like 4 years now, but I genuinely believe that we're one elite scorer from being a team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs when healthy sort of like the Bubble Heat. Assuming Fournier leaves this year via trade or free agency, a healthy Magic team has (guaranteed) Fultz, Isaac, Gordon, and Vucevic as starters, with Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Chuma Okeke, and Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. That's a pretty good core, but obviously right now we're running MCW, Gary Clark, Dwayne Bacon and James Ennis. If we could get that elite scorer, we would be idiots to trade players like Vucevic and Gordon to tank.  You also have to remember that Orlando isn't gonna pull many big names through trades or free agency any time soon, as we haven't had any real success in a decade. Pretty much any offer we get for Vucevic would be a bad trade on our part for us. Unfortunately for Celtics fans, we're not trading Vuc for Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and a couple seconds.  Finally, right now the East is too wide open to tank. While Fultz and Isaac are gone, Gordon and Anthony should return, and Steve Clifford and our FO wouldn't commit to tanking unless we had no shot at the playoffs, and we're only a couple games out."
"Everyone keeps saying trade Vucevic then having their pretend offer be Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and a couple second round picks. We’ve made the playoffs twice in a row, we did tank before that. Just wait to see what happens at the deadline and go from there"
"Yeah true that. Danny was getting Tatum at 1, or Tatum at 3 plus a pick (Romeo Langford).   Danny was in long with Tatum’s length to go alongside Brown’s girth. 👀"
Romeo Langford is following his lead. Shouldn’t draft guys from Millford Academy I guess.
The Celtics could offer a first rounder and Romeo Langford but that's about it
"I’m sorry, didn’t know there was a bunch of Romeo Langford fans here"
"I’m sorry, your comment started with Romeo Langford , therefore your whole port is trash."
"Romeo Langford is a great prospect. Sixers were patient with Embiid and it paid off, and I think Ainge will take that approach with Langford and his talent will eventually shine through.  Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith are good prospects.  Brown, Tatum, and Smart have great contracts. Only Tatum is getting the max and that was a no-brainer.  Celtics still own all of their own draft picks and have the biggest TPE in league history, a major asset.  This year isn't make-or-break for the Celtics necessarily. They may not be a true title contender with Hayward gone and Kemba in decline (although he might still have something in the tank), but they are still extremely well-positioned for the future. It's doubtful whether Ainge has any moves that could instantly vault them to contender status without also compromising the future. The most sensible move is probably to hold their cards and make use of the full TPE in the offseason, hopefully making a strong push for contention in 2022."
"Lol what have I did is wrong? Yes he was a really good high school player coming into college. So are a bunch of high school players that wash out in the NBA. He was good in college, doesn't mean that's gonna translate to the NBA. That's what we're talking about, how good Romeo Langford is in the NBA, not fucking college or high school lmao. And the facts are he just isn't a good offensive player in the NBA even when he was healthy.  And I don't think you realize how easily any half decent NBA talent dominates the G League. Antonio Blakeney averaged 35 a game down there and can't even get on an NBA roster. Even as rehab/learning his role Romeo should he able to easily dominate down there if he has anywhere close to an NBA level offensive game."
"We do need another guard.  Kemba/Smart/PP is a solid 3, so we just need a fourth that’s not Jeff Teague.  Still hoping Romeo Langford can come back soon and contribute"
You could tell me that Romeo Langford will be an all star or out of the league in 4 years and I’d believe both
"&gt; 2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)   Keldon Johnson's really the guy I regret missing out on at the end of the 2019 first round. Clarke had a great rookie season, but if his jumper is broken that could be a problem and Thybulle's got a long way to go too. I'm not willing to give up on Langford yet either; he's just been star-crossed by injuries."
"A lot of what you are saying is fair but ultimately boils down to my core point: Ainge is fine at drafting in the mid first round but under Stevens guys taken in that range have not developed. To go full in depth in the last decade you can also add the following players to the list of Ainge misses:    Zizic (23rd pick, not really clear if this was just the guy Cleveland wanted)  RJ Hunter (28)  James Young (17)  Lucas Nogueira (16)  Jared Sullinger (21)  Fab Melo (22)   MarShon Brooks	(25 and he was ehh)   J. R. Giddens (30)  And thats not to mention that Ainge basically has not hit on a SINGLE second rounder or undrafted player. Also I would say Pritchard is far from a sure thing (he has looked nice). Romeo Langford, not sure what planet you are living on there. Grant Williams I like but will he ever be a guy that plays more than 15 mins a game? The bottom line is that if you want to be a great NBA franchise then you gotta hit more than any of these guys-- just take a look at the Spurs or the Lakers late first round picks."
In terms of value:  1. Payton Pritchard  2. Picks after 2024  3. Picks before 2024  4. Romeo Langford  5. Rob Williams  6. Aaron Nesmith  7. Basically the rest of the bench  8. Danny Ainge’s celebrity chipotle card   We ended up using most of the picks we had after the mass exodus from 2019-2020
Probably like Romeo Langford and half a 1st.
"I’ve been following Langford since his sophomore year so maybe I am a little biased toward him but please, go watch a couple full college and high school games of Romeo Langford. He was absolutely incredible."
Langford has the second highest ceiling on the Celtics and nobody can tell me otherwise. He’s one of the greatest finishers in college basketball history and already is an elite defender at the NBA level. If we can start running plays specifically for Romeo he can be a problem. Romeo just needs to work with Jay L. And develop a jumper. If he can develop a jump shot I seriously believe he can be a top player in the league. Romeo has perennial all nba 1st team potential and I really hope we don’t squander it.
Good one but Semi is a good shooter and defender which is enough to be an NBA player. Romeo is already an Elite defender (just search up Romeo Langford defensive highlights) and was one of the greatest college finishers of all time. Langford has the second highest ceiling on the team behind Tatum but in front of Jaylen. Don’t doubt him.
Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford are only NBA players insomuch as they are currently on NBA teams. They are terrible basketball players.
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren’t NBA players I guess"
"In the past four drafts, the Celtics have had 10 first round picks. Two were Jaylen and Jason, great picks in the top 5.  The remaining 8 picks turned into Yabu, Romeo Langford, Ante Zizic, Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. And some future picks.   You're saying they couldn't have done any better with EIGHT first round picks than that collection of bench players I listed above??"
Romeo Langford has been injured since senior year of high school he was a top 5 recruit out of high school. He still has loads of potential if he is ever not injured.
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

"&gt; has made Luwaru-Cabarot and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan valuable contributors on Day 1.  Lol... Go ask Nets fans about DJ. He's about as useful as he was last season, that is say, the entire Nets fanbase wants a new center.   Also, TLC's production hasn't really changed from last year besides a dip in efficiency.   &gt; Still, right after he left Houston after 2018 he dropped off in every facet just months after  Yeah.   He went from guarding Curry and Durant every second he was on the court to no longer being a plus defender.  That wasn't losing Harden, that was losing his athleticism.   &gt;He's waaay worse now after all that mileage and his value is low enough to where you coulda snagged him and made him a decent enough contributor on limited minutes  Except in your plan he's playing major minutes as a core rotation piece.  &gt;Harden woulda made all your promising youngins with all this untapped potential you Cs fans have been raving about into valuable role players.  No, because we're struggling with consistency from those guys on both ends.   Grant Williams, for example, has the potential to be a good player but he's a foul magnet and Harden doesn't fix that issue at all.    &gt; I've been dumbfounded by how much this sub (and the NBA fandom in general) undervalues Harden and other stars in trades.  No, it's more that you're overvaluing him.   He's an incredible MVP level player, but Harden + 1 guy doesn't win you a championship. You need to have a proper roster constructed around them.   * DeAndre Jordan is a defensive liability against key matchups - With or without Harden * Ariza slowed down too much to be a positive 3&amp;D player - With or without Harden * PJ Tucker's defence has declined with his age - With or without Harden * Grant Williams + Semi Ojeleye + Aaron Nesmith have **potential** but won't magically become consistent defenders overnight - With or without Harden * Romeo Langford has been a fantastic defender but he can't stay healthy - With or without Harden  Also, Harden isn't making guys elite on the defensive end. Which, without you realising, a lot of your argument seems to stem from.  You need to be elite on both ends to win a title. That Houston team you're referencing was the only Houston team that was a serious title contender and they were the only Houston team that was good defensively (6th in the league).  Harden doesn't win with the 15th rated defence (who would be even lower after the trade)."
"Romeo Langford, Edwards, etc. All not good enough to be rotation players. Meanwhile Pelinka got Schroder and Trez, who are both talented and playing well. See the difference?"
"I don’t know, if I have a bad day I watch Romeo Langford defensive highlights"
"&gt; I think Gallo might be too high of a player.   My thinking was like Romeo Langford would get sent in the deal as well (“separately” to get around TPE trade restrictions) as I am still a believer in him, but yeah it’d have to be more than just a 1st to get Gallo to leave a team trying to make the playoffs.  &gt; my thinking was it has to be an expiring which is just another loop hole.  Bird rights"
Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye + pick(s) for Cam Johnson
"We're out Yuta and OG, they're out Romeo Langford/Marcus Smart/Robert Williams from what I'm seeing"
"I wanted this guy SO badly for us, and instead we took Nesmith at 14 who has contributed literally nothing, despite the allure of him being a player who could ""come in right away and contribute.""  I don't get it, we went for Romeo Langford the previous year at pick 14, who like RJ, was a 5-star recruit coming out of HS, that didn't have a great next step, and we took Langford because of the upside, knowing that he was a project.   But we weren't willing to apply that same logic for Hampton? Boggles my mind.   Anyways, I'm happy that he landed in Denver, that's such a good spot for his development, he could be your starting 2-guard within the next year or two."
Romeo Langford sweet prince :(
"Theis, Thompson, and Teague are pretty popular suggestions around our sub. Realistically though the latter two wouldn't be worth shit in a trade though.  Theis is on a cheap expiring contract and people think we'll lose if we let that happen. Can't say I agree with that though. If he plays out his contract like he's started it we'll have gotten great value out of Theis. Hard to imagine a trade around him that isn't a wash. Theis brings a lot to both ends of the floor, especially if he can sustain his recent 3pt shooting. The one knock on Theis is he isn't big or physical enough to play with the Embiid and Goberts of the league, but we aren't realistically trading for someone who is.  In my opinion our best asset who will net the most return, and currently contributes least to any win now aspirations, is probably Robert Williams. Shown all the potential to be a starter, and he's a decent energy piece off the bench right now, but at this point is fairly underdeveloped when it comes to fundamentals. A lot of our fans see him as a core piece of our future, but if the right return is there Danny has to take it. They've shown a lot less but the same applies to Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith too."
"It's all relative, compared to where you were coming out of the 2018 playoffs your current team is a bottom quartile outcome.  Coming out of the 2018 playoffs you had just pushed LeBron to 7 games without Kyrie or Hayward and were supposed to have two more top 5 picks incoming from the Kings and Grizzlies. Fast forward 2 years and Kyrie, Hayward and Horford are gone, the picks turned into Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith and Kemba looks like one of the worst contracts in the NBA."
"Yeah the celtics definitely would have had to trade brown or tatum to get a star, it's not like they have wasted 7 first round picks on Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Matisse Thybulle (traded), Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Desmond Bane (traded) in the past 3 years 😂😂😂. Definitely can't trade draft picks 😂😂"
"Signed Horford, traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.  Ainge gets a weird amount of hate for an absolutely stellar GM."
Romeo Langford
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
I'm sure that we'll try Langford on him at some point. Romeo is pretty good at staying disciplined against foul baiters and fancy dancers. I'm way more concerned about us having no rim protection when Harden gets into the defense.
"Sees a ""_6"" on a jersey (Nesmith 26), ""here comes Smart""   Sees a ""3_"" on a jersey (Semi 37), ""there goes Smart""  Sees Romeo Langford, ""here comes Nesmith"""
"Woah Romeo Langford, no way"
And also get Romeo Langford with Jayson
Look at Romeo Langford doing things. I thought this day would never come
Aaron Nesmith is now Romeo Langford not Marcus Smart
"Rob Williams, Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith have earned their minutes and a chance for an expanded role next season, all the other young guys can go tbh"
"What is this parallel universe you're living in where Stevens didn't help develop Smart, Brown, and Tatum? Or perhaps Robert Williams, who was taken 27th and has become the team's best center in 3 years despite constantly dealing with injuries? Payton Pritchard is already playing very well, Aaron Nesmith started out poorly but has already improved a ton over the course of the season and has been balling lately. I guess Grant Williams is pretty ass. Do we blame Brad for Romeo Langford being perpetually injured? The rest of our ""young core"" is second rounders and two-way guys so I really fail to see what else he could have done here."
you're missing Langford as well. I think Romeo and probably Grant get protected over TT and Kemba.
I don't think Romeo Langford should be in this conversation at all
"Pretty sure at this point, Romeo Langford is dead"
Feel like I wouldn’t call Romeo Langford a bust yet he’s been perpetually injured and was drafted solely for defense and intensity anyway which he’s done. Next year he will have a full offseason and more opportunities. If he doesn’t pick up the slack then yeah he’s a bust
Romeo Langford
"I agreed with pretty much everything but the overrated coach part. I don’t see what you expect Brad Stevens to do with a roster that has the worst bench depth in the league. Blame should go to Ainge for surrounding the Jays with Grant Williams, Carson Edwards, and Romeo Langford."
"When I saw the score-line, I thought the Knicks must've benched their starters for some reason, but no. Romeo Langford and Jabari Parker actually almost took the Knicks the distance, what the fuck happened?"
Knicks can't score on a team who's best defender is Romeo Langford?
"Here's why Romeo ""Savior"" Langford will not become much of anything: had no idea 2 seconds were on the shot clock on an inbound. If you have no awareness and minimal skill you're done! Thankfully for Boston Aaron Nesmith is already way better than Langford."
