"No they didn't. They got to the ECF once in 2016. 2017 and 2018 they got swept in the semis. In 2018 both the Pacers and the baby Celtics did better against Cleveland (both going to tight game 7s). I'm not trying to say they sucked, they were certainly a very good team, but they were not winning the title without Kawhi (and Gasol, for that matter).

"In the Clippers series, the Clippers went really small and took Zubac out, took Montrezl out, and put JaMychal Green at the 5. Malone noticed that Jokic was getting doubled and Murray was getting blitzed frequently, and set up more plays for Harris and Grant.  Defensively, the Nuggets, according to Kawhi Leonard, became more aggressive in their double-teams. Additionally, they adjusted to collapsed the paint paint better on drives. A big part of this was Malone's decision to reign in MPJ, which you may remember was pretty vocal about this at the time. These were some adjustments that were mad that helped them come out of the Clippers series."

My MVP favorites are:  1. Joel Embiid 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Kevin Durant 5. Lebron James
"Kawhi ""Aeieieieeiao"" Leonard"
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs struggling in the regular season. He‚Äôs a playoff monster.   Top 10 players in order:  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá."
Amazing. People were down on the Rockets after their disaster 2016 season and clowned moves like signing Ryan Anderson stating their defense would be laughably bad. James comes out and gets full reign of the ball and leads the league in assists and takes the Rockets (whom were expected to finish with a lower record than Russell Westbrook's Thunder) to a better record and solid 3 seed in the West. Ultimately the season ends in very disappointing fashion with the Rockets losing to an overall better Spurs team by 40 without Kawhi Leonard. But that season was a success based on pre-season expectations.
No our starting 5 would be   PG: Tony Parker  SG: Manu Ginobli  SF: George Gervin/ Kawhi Leonard I don't know who I would pick to be honest  PF: Tim Duncan  C: David Robinson
Kawhi Leonard deserves it more than Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokiƒá.  Kevin Durant and LeBron James should be the favorites to win MVP though. Interesting that the top 3 MVP candidates are the 3 best players in the NBA (in order).
"LeBron‚Äôs won the last 6 game 7‚Äôs he‚Äôs played, unless you‚Äôre taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He‚Äôs played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.

"""Now here's Kawhi Leonard with the weather; Kawhi?‚Äù  ""It's gon rain.""  ""Thanks Kawhi."""
"Kinda makes me sad for all those great players that had their development stunted by horrible organizations. Kings fans always lament that we could have had Klay Thompson or Kawhi Leonard, but the truth is there is a high likelihood their development would have been stunted by Keith fucking Smart and the rest of the trash coaches we've had the past couple of years.   This is the same as the corporate world; good managers and leaders are the most valuable commodity of any company. If you find an org that maximizes your skills and you're able to grow into something better long-term, you stick with that."
"Bruh unless you're Scottie Pippen and Kawhi Leonard level wing defender or an elite rim-protector, you never trade elite shooting like what Seth brings to the table. Seth is just not a good shooter, he is a great shooter. That is very hard to find."
"let me ask you this, is KD a better scorer than Harden? Is KD a better scorer than luka or lebron? If so then by how much. Is Luka a better scorer than Kawhi Leonard?"
When you tell your mum you wanna buy Kawhi Leonard but she says you already have Kawhi Leonard at home.
"Imagine thinking Luka Donƒçiƒá was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn‚Äôt be me. Luka Donƒçiƒá isn‚Äôt even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"Luka Donƒçiƒá, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the overrated trio. I‚Äôm going to keep saying it. I don‚Äôt care if it hurts your feelings.  Giannis Antetokounmpo isn‚Äôt a top 5 player in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Anthony Davis are better.  Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn‚Äôt the 2nd best player of the 2010s. Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.   Luka Donƒçiƒá isn‚Äôt a top 10 player in the NBA. Luka Donƒçiƒá doesn‚Äôt have GOAT potential."
Clippers offense is fluid AF  Bobby schmurda = üêê    Kawhi Leonard is good at basketball
"I'd say Jokic is a better passer which is huge praise in itself. He's the only player in the world that has no discernable flaw on offense, other than LeBron, and he does it as a 5 which creates a matchup nightmare for every team in the league. The best player he's ever played with is a borderline all star and he led a 3-1 comeback against arguably a title favourite. Give Jokic a Pascal Siakam or Bradley Beal type player and he could average a triple double on a championship team. LeBron is top 3 at the absolute worst all time but in 2021 Big Honey has it all.  As for Giannis, he reminds me a lot of young LeBron. If you can't knock down your free throws and if you can't score at 3 levels, you can't be the best player in the world.  I think that LeBron, Jokic, Kevin Durant, AD Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry have an argument for being the best player in the world. Doncic is knocking on the door. Everyone else either has a major flaw (Giannis, Harden) or is just not as good as someone else who does the same thing (Lillard [Curry] , Embiid [AD] )."

"I'm not saying he's a better overall player than either one. That would be silly. &amp; he's obviously not as good on D as Kawhi ""former DPOY"" Leonard.  But I do think Royce is a better overall defensive player than Paul George, and I think he's been as good--or better--of a ""3 &amp; D"" type wing defensive specialist than any player this season. (which PG is not) Lou Dort is the only guy I've seen that's been as good as Royce."
"I'm a Jazz fan and I've watched a majority of the minutes Royce has played in the NBA.  Even if he does, which he won't, he's still the 3rd most-accomplished perimeter defender in this conversation at best.   Paul George and Kawhi Leonard are very good at basketball."
"Most likely to be named all stars in the West:  LeBron James  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic   Damian Lillard   That leaves 2 spots. But there's heavy competition for those with guys like Morant, Booker, SGA, McCollum, Anthony Davis, Fox (just to name a few)"
15. Kevin Garnett  31. Kawhi Leonard   OK.
"Depends how you are measuring impact, but for the past three years he is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. With one exception, those were the top five finishers in the 2019-20 MVP vote (Jokic was 9th), while Gobert wasn‚Äôt mentioned on a single ballot.  I prefer these kinds of metrics versus 1st all-nba ballot nods and such, but to eachs own. I get an argument against 10 impact too"
"Yes the nets and clippers have famous playoff underperformers such as kawhi leonard and kevin durant on their team, they will definitely never win anything yes"
"&gt;magically make him Paul George or Kawhi Leonard  I looked it up, and was very surprised to learn that, quietly, Tobias has roughly the same amount of career points as Kawhi. He also has more career rebounds, while trailing slightly in blocks, and more so in assists and steals."
It‚Äôs a sixers fan! Kawhi Leonard.
"Kawhi Leonard because he punked the spurs and had NBA fans thinking our front office tried to force him to play and that our medical staff sucked. Also he pushes off a ton but never gets called for it, this started happening way back in the 2017 season."
"This is why we got him and yes, why we paid him. Not because paying him the max would magically make him Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. But because he's the exact type of player that fits perfectly next to Joel and Ben. Can be a scorer when necessary, a spot up shooter when necessary, and can defend and rebound when necessary. And we needed elite three point shooting from the PF position and we had a large sample size from his time in LA that showed he was just that.   With this spacing and him back at his actual position Joel isn't the only one that is shooting better. He also has a ton of room to operate this year."
We only lost tonight because Kawhi Leonard and PG weren't playing.
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|¬±6.3|¬±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|¬±4.0|¬±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|¬±6.3|¬±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|¬±6.8|¬±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|¬±5.9|¬±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|¬±7.5|¬±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|¬±7.4|¬±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|¬±6.8|¬±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|¬±9.1|¬±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|¬±6.7|¬±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|¬±7.7|¬±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|¬±6.1|¬±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|¬±6.7|¬±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|¬±7.5|¬±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|¬±7.4|¬±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|¬±8.4|¬±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|¬±8.9|¬±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|¬±8.5|¬±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|¬±9.5|¬±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|¬±11.7|¬±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|¬±11.5|¬±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|¬±10.0|¬±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|¬±7.3|¬±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|¬±10.7|¬±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|¬±11.5|¬±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"Why does Beal not get a pass but other NBA stars do?  Anthony Davis, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, etc.  All these guys demanded trades out of their organization.  It's quite obvious the Wizards have done little to put their team in a position to contend.  I mean John Wall comes back and they make a pretty lateral move to trade him for Russ.  If I was Beal, I'd be upset with the organization, and the Wizards should absolutely trade him before they lose him for nothing."
"Ahead of Luka Doncic, Zach LaVine, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis as a top 25 offensive player. Biased media never giving Lakers or ex-Lakers their fair shake. Sad!"
"I don't think Jokic is a lock by any means. He is easily one of the best players in the West, but his fan support is in no way in the LeBron, Luka &amp; Steph category.   Steph has had a few down years in terms of team releveancy, so he may not make the fan vote. Jokic will also be going up against Davis, Kawhi, PG, (possibly LeBron or Luka if they are listed as front court players). So far from a lock IMO.   FWIW, I think the West starters will be:   F1: Anthony Davis  F2: Nikola Jokic  F3: Kawhi Leonard  G1: LeBron James  G2: Luka Donƒçiƒá   &amp;#x200B;  With Nikola and Kawhi's spots most up for grabs."
"nobody on that team should have won mvp but curry should have been higher than 6th place, the top vote getter for the warriors that year (kd also missed the last couple months of the season). same thing in 2018 where kd finished 7th but should have been top 3 considering steph missed 30 games.  imo kawhi leonard should have been mvp over westbrook and harden in 2017, the spurs had almost as good of a record as the warriors and didn't have 4 all stars either."

"They *can* be misleading.  Which is why you need to watch games.  And if you watch the Warriors play, you'll see his defense is *stellar*.  At some point when both the eye test *and* the stats say a player is good, you might as well acknowledge that the player is good.  By the numbers, he's playing like one of the best defenders in the NBA.  He also *looks* like one of the best defenders in the NBA. He shutdown Kawhi Leonard twice in a row.  So maybe it's time for *you* to put up some ""evidence"" for why he *isn't*?"

"[Doc was fined $50,000 for talking about Kawhi](https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-clippers-fined-doc-rivers-tampering-kawhi-leonard-20190531-story.html). Kawhi and the raps were headed into the playoffs, and doc said that Kawhi was the closest thing the league had to Jordan.   It‚Äôs true that the clippers as an org likely crossed some line in their pursuit of Kawhi, so maybe the fine was more a collective fine as opposed to fining a coach singularly for his actions. It wasn‚Äôt after the game, as you say, but they have fined coaches before."
"I tnki you can see it three ways.  Who is the best basketball player who wore raptors jersey then without a doubt Hakeem Olajuwon Who is the player that played the basketball in raptors jersey then it's Kawhi Leonard If you want to find the best player that played multiple season and continuously played the best then you can choose between Chis Bosh, Demar Derozen and Kyle Lowry. I think because Lowry won the title and rest did not, he is the goat torontian."
Kalii Lillard. Has a ring to it  Kinda sounds like Kawhi Leonard
Clippers had some guy named Kawhi Leonard he‚Äôs practically just as good as Lebron
You do realize Shaq averaged 59% TS for his *career* right? That would have made him as efficient as Paul George and Kawhi Leonard last year. And more efficient than guys like LeBron and Butler.
Kyrie for kawhi leonard? PG13 and kyrie are perfect for each other!
Kawhi Leonard has won two titles with two different teams playing within a system and transcending it when it matters most. Kawhi Leonard is not a superstar solely because he‚Äôs having an average season by his standards. He is a superstar for what he has proven to have done in the league. He is a superstar that trancends a system.   What superstar can you think of that hasn‚Äôt been able to overcome a system to find great personal success?
"Why are you being so condescending hahaha  Let‚Äôs look at James Hard and Stephen Curry. Both are the system and are superstars. Kawhi Leonard‚Äî superstar and trancends a system that revolves around him.   Damian Lillard‚Äî superstar? I think so. Plays within a system that allows him to go off. I can see why people would argue against it.   Donovan Mitchell is a star and not a superstar. Rudy Gobert being the focus of their system has produced him individual awards and no real post season success. Good defensive player, not a superstar."

"The whopping two games he didn‚Äôt play in the playoffs? One of which the Warriors barely won with CP3 shooting 3-14? Uh, okay.  &gt; Because if you actually watch, KD started doing this after game 2 of Clippers before any injury. He went from being super passive (only averaging 12 FGA over a month) to super aggressive for no reason other than to fill his own ego.  After he made his ‚Äúyou know who I am‚Äù comment which apparently deeply hurt you for some inexplicably stupid reason, he lit the Clippers and then the Rockets up, consecutively. He averaged 35/5/5 against the Clippers on 72% TS, for fuck‚Äôs sake. Lou Will and PBev went on to have a memorable interview where they said they tried every defensive scheme on KD and couldn‚Äôt do anything, and highlighted KD making that statement as a genuine turning point.  You‚Äôre crying about this as if it‚Äôs a bad thing.   &gt; Except it's not, every sane person agrees Golden State looked like a completely different team without KD.   You mean, like an excellent, record-breaking team but not a broken team that‚Äôs the greatest ever assembled and destroying any semblance of parity in the NBA?  Odd now to see from you, highly intelligent NBA analyst, that the Warriors are somehow tougher without KD. It‚Äôs a wonder everyone still cries about KD joining the Warriors.   &gt; Yeah no fucking shit, the Warriors were a top heavy team paying KD big money, when he's injured we have to play guys like Quinn Cook and McKinnie to guard Kawhi Leonard and Lowry. It's a fucking testament to how well Curry impacts the offense that they even won those 2 games.  Of course. And if KD had played and the Warriors won, you‚Äôd be saying that his likely 30+ ppg on 60% TS was trivial and in fact somehow damaging to the team‚Äôs pure, angelic basketball style. Even though they fucking won, lol. Too transparent."
"&gt; You keep bringing up a 100% win rate against the Rockets without KD... what, in the regular season? What? You think that‚Äôs a salient point?  No this includes playoffs as well when KD was injured   &gt;  wouldn‚Äôt that only highlight KD‚Äôs impact? That he was able to make up for his superstar teammate‚Äôs relative struggles and then some against a tough Rockets team?  Because if you actually watch, KD started doing this after game 2 of Clippers before any injury. He went from being super passive (only averaging 12 FGA over a month) to super aggressive for no reason other than to fill his own ego.   &gt; I know it was especially clear how unimportant KD was to that team when he got injured and they went on to lose to the Raptors 4-2.  No one here is claiming KD wasn't unimportant, stop attacking a strawman. What's being discussed here is KD had a 'stylistic tension' with the team which hurt the team, not always, but very frequently depending on what he wanted to prove. KD wasn't playing ego iso ball in 2017 when this team was at its absolute peak.   &gt;  that ‚Äústylistic tension‚Äù and actual impact on the court are two completely different arguments.  Except it's not, every sane person agrees Golden State looked like a completely different team without KD. Seth Curry claims Golden State was 'not better, but harder to guard due to increased ball motion' when KD was injured. Literally even the shit analysts could see the difference like night and day. Which means you're even below that level. And I emphasize again that KD did not always have this iso mentality on Golden State because the dude is damn fickle, it's evaluated on a series by series basis.  &gt; how unimportant KD was to that team when he got injured and they went on to lose to the Raptors 4-2.  Yeah no fucking shit, the Warriors were a top heavy team paying KD big money, when he's injured we have to play guys like Quinn Cook and McKinnie to guard Kawhi Leonard and Lowry. It's a fucking testament to how well Curry impacts the offense that they even won those 2 games."

"I don't think it's controversial to put Kidd or Payton above Leonard, especially Kidd. But I'm biased cause I fucking hate Kawhi"
"Paul George, who last month signed a 5 year Max contract, and Kawhi Leonard, who it took 4 years to finally get to LA, will leave?"
"There was a post last week about him guarding Leonard.  [Held Leonard to 2 points, 1 assist, 5 TOs, 1/4 FG, 0/2 3pt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ksryl4/kawhi_leonard_when_defended_by_andrew_wiggins/)  [The, 4 points, 5 TOs, 2/12 FG](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ktwghm/kawhi_leonard_when_being_guarded_by_andrew/)  [2nd link included a defensive compilation]( https://streamable.com/9y19z3)  Disclaimer: I dont really like these ""x defending y"" stats as they're finnicky in how they track.  But watching the games, he does a really good job at staying in front of Kawhi. On their second matchup, Clippers were trying to force Curry to switch on Leonard but couldnt. This led to a lot of Kawhi drives/midrange missing cause Wiggins actually kept up with him. Killed all of Clippers' offense that game."
I think the Raptors have interest in 2xDPOY Kawhi Leonard
"lmao if LeBron can recruit the best players in the league, any team should be able to. Y‚Äôall stacked af and have two top 5, TWO TOP FIVE PLAYERS. This aint no kawhi leonard and paul george parity, it‚Äôs like Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon teaming up. They showed their dominance in the playoffs and the Nets responded, lakers improved their depth too by adding DENNIS SCHROEDER, GASOL, HARRELL to an already OP team. Play your cards right cause i know youd be cheering if your team had these pieces (Harden etc)"
&gt;‚Ä¢	‚Å†Kawhi Leonard: 458-time career dunks and Fun Guy  Dog. The screenshot you posted clearly doesn't say this. 458-time career dunks?
"I feel like the raptors might be able to win with kawhi leonard, just a hunch. To be serious though any of those 3. This team is well constructed except for the massive hole where a superstar goes."
Each Spurs run was anchored by an MVP level player like Tim Duncan or Kawhi Leonard. For this guy to say they don‚Äôt need a superstar is crazy.
"Calling anyone who has a first name as their last name by their last name sounds really weird      Ex. Chris Paul, Lebron james, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard. The only exeptions to this are d‚Äôangelo Russell and Michael Jordan"
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
Leonard feels pretty weird when you're used to Kawhi.
"I'm biased but I agree.   Ridiculous generational stats: Embiid and Jokic  Team Success: Embiid, LeBron, Harden, Kawhi  Not playing with another superstar: Embiid, Jokic, Curry  Two way player: Embiid, LeBron, Kawhi  Crazy efficiency: Jokic, Embiid, Curry, Leonard, Harden  He literally checks every box people look for in an MVP. (also I left Giannis off of the list because, fair or not, there is no way the media is giving him the award three times in a row.)"
"I mean that's kind of the point though right? It's not a team full of polished ready to roll talen it's not a team that's got a Chris Paul or a Rudy gobert or a kawhi Leonard or an Anthony Davis sitting in the wings. It's not a team that can afford for him to have an off week or so because as you stated they don't currently have the firepower to blow guys out. It's a team that lives and dies by demar right now. I don't know if you've had a chance to watch them much this year. They're full of young up and coming players but The difference in offensive cohesion when he's on versus off is absolutely dramatic. He has become one of the most measured floor generals in the entire NBA. off the top of my head I can think of at least six of those 18 wins that demar single-handedly 100%, won for them. So just saying that those players are better than him I think is to do a disservice to how radically he has morphed his game the last couple of years. And again this is coming from someone that was one of his most vocal critics during those raptor runs. I used to throw a huge huge fit every time he would be named an All Star. The guy is damn good right now."
"Paul George 2019, Chris Paul 2008, Peja Stojakovic 2004, Kawhi Leonard 2016"
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust. Not like the guy that went to Golden State at Pick Number 11: KLAY THOMPSON. They also missed out on Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard. Woof."
Jared Dudely is who Kawhi Leonard thinks he is.
"and they lost to a dominant Kawhi Leonard which, and I say this from experience, is not something to be ashamed about."
Do you genuinely believe the duo of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is better than the duo of Lebron James and Anthony Davis? That Clippers team also had so many chemistry problems all season long and could never get it right.
"Finals MVP doesn‚Äôt really weigh as heavy for me mainly because of when Kawhi Leonard won it with the Spurs and when Iguodala won his for the Warriors. Stats, MVP‚Äôs, and rings for me."
"&gt;Giannis  I'll give you that, he wasn't really that well known by North American commentators until he was drafted.  &gt;KAT, Kawhi, Harden  ???? KAT was on an almost undefeated Kentucky team that was much watch TV for people who didn't even like college ball. Kawhi Leonard was dragging a San Diego State team to a 2 seed. James Harden was a college first team all American his sophomore year which led him to being a 3rd overall pick. These guys were very popular in college ball, they just played before the current social media era of having viral highlights by the time you're a HS freshman."
I swear to god this dude was about to become the next Kawhi Leonard
"You can‚Äôt just expect everyone to have the same development path as Kawhi lol, he‚Äôs one of the most extreme cases of someone developing their game over time  There are far, far more players who average 11 ppg at the age of 21 that do not become Kawhi Leonard"
I meant before Kawhi. Who am I missing?  Apparently Kawhi is the first to leave after winning finals MVP: https://hoopshype.com/2019/07/06/kawhi-leonard-first-to-leave-for-other-nba-team-right-after-winning-finals-mvp/

He was mid jump and Kawhi held out his arm, the NBA literally reviewed that and said it‚Äôs the correct call.  https://streamable.com/s29c1p  You tried to show a blanket angle but not the one angle that shows Leonard extending himself?"
Never would have thought people would think Jokic is better than James freaking Harden or Kawhi Leonard...yet here we are....
"As a corollary, the return the Spurs got for Kawhi leonard of Demar Derozan, Jakob Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson looks horrible by comparison even if it looks better than it did at the time of the trade."
Demar Derozan is a better offensive player than Kawhi Leonard. Someone on Twitter with a decent following was trying to say this right after the Trade in 2018.
"Kawhi Leonard (before he was a Raptor), now it's Jimmy Butler"
Kawhi Leonard
The Clippers will never win the championship. Leonard and George are overrated and are not leaders. Kawhi is a very good #2 and George is clutch only in situations that aren't important.
I'm looking forward to that game.  I really hope both teams are at full strength.  You got:    Ty Lue vs Doc Rivers:  Ty now coaches the team Doc was just fired from.  Doc pretty much said don't expect any different results from this Clippers team because Ty is just as responsible for the Clippers blown 3-1 lead since he was Doc's lead Assistant Coach at the time.  Plus Ty was supposedly the front runner for the 76ers job until Doc took it from him.    Paul George vs Doc Rivers:  There have been sneak dissing comments from both towards the other as to who is to blame for The Bubble.  Plus PG fucked his daughter then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Tobias Harris vs The Clippers:  Tobias plays his former team who he left because he felt like they low-balled him a contract offer.    Paul George vs Seth Curry:  PG13 fucked his wife then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Plus they had a lot of chirping goin back and forth during The Bubble when Seth was with Dallas.    Kawhi Leonard vs The 76ers:  Kawhi hits one of the most memorable post-season shots of all time to eliminate the 76ers in a Game 7 to then go on and win a Chip and Finals MVP.

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"The OKC Thunder had a consistent track record of success when Paul George forced his way to LA in 2019  The Toronto Raptors are known for being well run and *were coming off a championship* when Kawhi Leonard left for LA  These teams can‚Äôt be described as poorly-run, but they‚Äôre small-markets who lost out to LA"
"Yet somehow people find a way to throw him into MVP discussions in years were there is no debate OR he doesn't deserve it, i.e 2018, 2020 and 2021.  Kawhi Leonard averages more points, steals, blocks, shoots a better percentage from the field, 3-PT and FT, has a higher PER and WS/48 while winning more games, but he is 6th while LeBron is 2nd.  Nikola Jokic averages more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, has a higher FG%, 3-PT% and FT%, but he is 3rd while LeBron is 2nd.  LeBron shouldn't even be Top 5 in MVP voting so far yet people are trying to put him into a two way race with Embiid. Last year he should've gotten zero votes when compared to Giannis's record breaking season, but his stans still found a way to put him there.  Embiid, Kawhi, Jokic, Giannis and Steph/Dame should be the Top 5, but let's put LeBron at 2nd when he is 5-5 without Anthony Davis in the starting lineup while putting worse stats than all of them."
"That is an interesting take considering the team without Kawhi : blew a 20+ point lead in just over a quarter, were blown out in the next 3 games.  For a parallel, LeBron (better player) had a better team and still barely drew blood.  Of course we will never know, but it seems quite a stretch that 16-1 would have not even gotten to 12 because Kawhi Leonard? Im upvoting you because thats.... thats quite a take"
"Marc Gasol played with Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard.  Jokic plays with MPJ and Murray.   Obviously Jokic isn‚Äôt nearly as good a defender as Gasol but it‚Äôs also hard when every dude and his mum can blow by your guards and you‚Äôre trying to stay out of foul trouble because you are your entire teams offensive system."

"The fuck are you talking about dude. Jokic in his two seasons of playoffs has been the best players in series that had Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Gobert and Donovan Mitchell."
"Yeah but he can‚Äôt really guard wings. There‚Äôs a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn‚Äôt move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I‚Äôm not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He‚Äôs been a lockdown defender in past season."
PG- Walt Frazier/Jason Kidd  SG- Sidney Monciref/Michael Jordan  SF- Scottie Pippen/Kawhi Leonard   PF- Kevin Garnett/Tim Duncan  C- Bill Russell/Hakeem Olajuwon
Kawhi Leonard
This is his fourth year. We saw the great bubble he had last year. But he‚Äôs in that same stage and timeline of his career where guys like Dwyane Wade and Kawhi Leonard took their leaps and became Finals MVPs
There are so many players that do that and it is *annoying* because there is no foul  Kawhi Leonard and Rudy Gobert come to mind
"Holy fuck these nerds think Mike fucking Conley is as impactful as Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid because a stat told them to.  Joel Embiid is an MVP candidate carrying his team to first in the East and somehow Mike Conley is on par with him? What reaction do you think you would garner from say, the NBA on TNT crew if you said that Mike Conley is ""as impactful"" as that list becuase RAPTOR said so."
"&gt;Except Kawhi can't leave to team up with a Kyrie Irving-level player and have one of the deepest teams in the league. Once again he'd be signing with a team that's not that good like Chicago or New York. If he wants to go to an already established contender that can't get him otherwise (Bucks, Warriors, 76ers, Jazz) it's gonna cost them. If this situation were to play out it'd be similar to the Anthony Davis situation with New Orleans. It would take 3 young guys (or 2 + 1 star), a guaranteed top 10 pick, and more picks on top of that especially since sign-and-trades can only be for 3+ years and look what they got for Davis with only 1 year left on his.  Except he literally can do that with the Warriors  &gt;It would be a bidding war. Miami and Philadelphia both fumbled the bag with Harden so they'd be in the race. The 76ers would offer Simmons + Maxey, the Heat would offer 3 of Bam, Herro, and/or Robinson, the Celtics would offer Brown and their young guys, the Raptors would call and offer Siakam, the Nuggets would offer Murray, the Suns would offer Ayton, the Pelicans would offer Ingram, the Jazz would offer the Hawks would offer Collins and Hunter, hell... Even the Nets would probably see if they could get him for Kyrie. I think I'd take all of those offers (with appropriate picks attached of course) before taking Wiggins.  It wouldn‚Äôt be a bidding war since it‚Äôs literally a sign and trade. Do you understand how sign and trades work?   &gt;This discussion is asinine anyway since Leonard isn't gonna be requesting a trade. The Western Conference is weaker than its ever been with the ""dark horse"" being a team that made no significant changes and got bounced in the 1st round last season. This year should be the year we get Clippers/Lakers in the WCF and the healthier of the two teams will triumph.  Again, he wouldn‚Äôt be requesting a trade. He would be leaving in *free agency* through a sign and trade.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal) is the definition since you clearly don‚Äôt know what it means.  But yeah you‚Äôre clearly a biased Clippers fan so I guess I‚Äôm wasting my time."

"‚ÄúWilkes wanted a job as the team‚Äôs vice president of special events. He wanted a five-year contract. He wanted a staff of four to five people. He wanted the use of four courtside seats and a skybox. He wanted to suggest local coaches to hire for the Clippers‚Äô G League franchise. And he wanted $2.5 million in exchange for his purported role in Leonard choosing the Clippers.  The list, which Wilkes testified he presented to Clippers consultant Jerry West during lunch in Beverly Hills two weeks after Leonard signed, misspells Wilkes‚Äô last name and erroneously refers to Leonard as ‚ÄúKawi.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe call was discussed at length during Wilkes‚Äô deposition taken last month and excerpted in exhibits attached to the court filing.             ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- ‚ÄúOn this telephone conversation, my question to you is was there any negotiation after you said to Mr. West, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll pay‚Äô ‚Äî ‚ÄòI want $2.5 million‚Äô?

Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."

"That‚Äôs the point my dude, it‚Äôs easier to hide bad defenders in the regular reason. Look at what happens to Lou Williams in the playoffs. The targeting becomes so untenable they get played off the floor.  The gap in the armor doesn‚Äôt become a problem until you have Kawhi Leonard iso switching to hunt him for 4+ games straight  It‚Äôs also why the Lakers were so dominant - they had the floor of 5 great defenders out at once against other teams who didn‚Äôt"

"You can say ‚ÄúKeep in mind‚Äù but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his ‚ÄúLA or bust‚Äù thing wasn‚Äôt even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don‚Äôt really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn‚Äôt been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."

Nephew is what we call Kawhi Leonard because we lost respect for him
"Pippen was a great scorer and playmaker, you have to take into account the eras they played in. Pippen's among the top 5, 10 at worst SFs of all time for a reason. He was the Kawhi Leonard of the 90s, except he was as good of a playmaker as Giannis."
"He never said there was a correlation, he just identified Kawhi Leonard as ""The one with 2 rings"""
"The league was making an effort to complain about Kawhi and fine the Clippers for resting him last season because they said he was healthy but listed it as Knee soreness instead of load management. The idea a player can just be like yeah me and the team agreed to keep paying me for a service I'm not providing while healthy as to not risk the ""asset"" while they work on a trade is a bit preposterous if you can't just sit for load management while relatively healthy without making up an excuse.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/11/8/20954873/kawhi-leonard-clippers-fine-rest-load-management-doc-rivers-gmib"
"We probably would not have, as our team was completely imploding from bad chemistry those playoffs. Our team was on the verge of mental collapse for over half the season.  Adding Kawhi ‚Äúlate to every flight‚Äù Leonard or Anthony ‚ÄúMy Uncle says I can‚Äôt play in Boston‚Äù David and losing Jaylen would‚Äôve fucked us so bad last season and moving forward."
"Leonard clearly pushed off. Was it very obvious? No. Do plays like that happen a lot and not called ? Sure . Did harden flop to embellish the contact ? Yeah. At the end of the day , i think the right call was made . People can‚Äôt say Kawhi didn‚Äôt push off , even though it was minor ."
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"Wow idk why but for some reason I assumed that was Meyers Leonard, I'm so use to people writing Kawhi for Kawhi Leonard"
The Clippers. I used to love watching the CP3/Griffin Clippers. Chris Paul and Kawhi Leonard are two of my favourite players ever.

It was a corny joke referring to Kawhi Leonard. Who's ironically coasting on D lately.
"How is my take ignorant? There are amazing players who did not win championships because they were on crappy teams or were up against unbeatable dynasties. There are mediocre players who have hands full of rings. The number of championships won is irrelevant to a best player at a position list unless that player was a one man band leading his team to a championship, something that has happened only a handful of times.   Kawhi Leonard, while being a driving force for Toronto was hardly alone on that team. They had 6 guys average double figures on that team. Siakam, Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka, and Danny Green were all awesome defensive players who helped Kawhi carry the load offensively as well.   I am not looking only at offense, but being able to consistently put up points for a long period of time is important. Kawhi will be on my list someday if he keeps up the good work. He isn‚Äôt there yet. Make your own damn list if you want to ride his dick so bad."

"He is more than playing up to his contract.  He's all-nba defense level on all five positions. If he doesn't get it this year, it will be robbery.  His efficiency has improved to .480/.400/.750 despite increasing his usage to 10 shots a game.  His handle has improved and his drives too.  If he can maintain that efficiency while going up to 15-20 shots a game (an incredibly hard thing to do), he'll basically be Kawhi Leonard without the load management.   He has no ceiling."
The Lakers would have to slide pretty significantly in Anthony Davis' absence while the Sixers finish at the top of the East. Kawhi Leonard could also win it if the Clippers finish first.
Kawhi Anthony Leonard
"&gt; Think Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard rolled into the same body  What In the World lol. Of all the players Larry Bird could be compared to I would almost never expect those three."

"That guy is a dumb ass, he isn't even trolling either. He's been saying dumb shit about Kawhi Leonard for months."
"The player you‚Äôre describing is not Kawhi Leonard, I have no idea what the hell you‚Äôre talking about"
"""Think Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard rolled into the same body"""
"The knocks on Leonard are almost exclusively in the realm of what it means to be a leader or how does he raise the ceiling for his teammates. I won't say that there is nothing there, but it ain't much. In terms of basketball ability, I'm not aware of anything Kawhi can't do."
"Really depends on how you evaluate things like the Warriors first championship their accolades going into the season is 1 time All Star Stephen Curry. He wins MVP that season but there were still a couple years of ""he's not that good he's only getting it because the best player on the team with the best record.""  There's so much retroactive judgement that happens that these conversations get weird. Like of course the Spurs win in 2014 Kawhi Leonard, the finals MVP, is a star! That was team ball all the way. It was Diaw, Mills, Green stepping up with aging veterans.  If the Jazz win it will be of course they won, look at what Conley did. Or Mitchell. Or maybe even Gobert. It depends on who really steps up. And if they lose, of course they lost, they don't have a true star.  There's more to it than just who's who. If the Jazz rely on Ingles getting open shots to win the championship they might struggle. I think Gobert has enough gravity on the roll to keep him open in the playoffs. That team is hard to guard and they're good defensively."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"Huge props to Kawhi Leonard for two offensive boards in the last minute. Those were probably the play of the game even though we nearly brought it back. Great win for the Clippers who just got healthy, nice effort by the Jazz to show that if we do meet in the playoffs, it's going to be a banger of a series!"

Man...I just don't get the strip club. What's the appeal? Especially for someone like Kawhi Leonard? You could fuck anyone you want. Not even having to pay for it. Why go watch a girl dance and waste hundreds of dollars?
Kawhi Leonard is actually two children who were trying to sneak into am r rated movie but accidentally made it in the nba
that is a shot...... to the throat....... of kawhi leonard   why did reggie say it like that
Kawhi ‚ÄúMoe Harkless‚Äù Leonard
Playmaking is a very big thing to set aside. It's what separates LeBron from kawhi Leonard.
&gt; I don't know why people hate on Durant so much for doing whatever he could to win a ring but somehow praise Masai Ujiri as some kind of genius for dumping their all time franchise star player for 1 year of mercenary kawhi Leonard who didn't even want to be there so they could win a cheap ring when all the warriors players got hurt and then left as soon as he could   LOL I can't tell if you are trolling or genuinely stupid

Kawhi Leonard üò•
"kawhi leonard, kyle lowry and pascal siakam were all playing through injuries that would have kept them out of regular season games"
Kawhi Leonard seems similar. Idk I don‚Äôt watch baseball though
"not in the reg season, but his 2019 playoff run was similar to Michael Jordan   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/6/14/18679089/kawhi-leonard-toronto-raptors-playoff-statistics-historical-context           beat the Simmons/Reddick/Butler/Harris/Embiid Sixers off a buzzer beater in game 7, beat a historic season Bucks that had the MVP after trailing 2-0, and then beat the Warriors. Yeah his team was stacked with good ass players and he didn‚Äôt do it alone but it doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that he was the best player in the playoffs that year"
Funny how the raptors lost Vince carter and gained kawhi Leonard on almost identical circumstances. Only difference is the spurs got a good return on the trade.
No he is talking about seventh game of 2021 finals of clippers vs nets in which paul george infamously finishes an ally oop right before the buzzer that was thrown to him off the backboard by kawhi Leonard giving the clippers our first championship and then we finally get bullied less by lakers fans
"Kawhi Leonard-like???  The kid is twenty years old and played 3 and a half college games!  Kawhi played 2 years and went deep into the tourney his sophmore year.    Also, Kawhi Leonard's rookie year:  averaged 8 points, 5 rebounds, 1.3 steals in 24 minutes per game.  Wiseman so far this year:  11.5 points, 6 rebounds, 1 block in 21.8 minutes per game.  I know we are looking at different positions here, but he's having a pretty great rookie year despite having little college experience.  He's still LEARNING!  By the time Steph is out of his prime, this kid is still going to be in his mid-20s and will be a much better player.  He has the skills, just needs experience and that takes time.  It is WAY too early to count him out and we would be stupid to trade him at this juncture."
"I'm not saying he's better overall than those guys but his per 36 stats are absurd:  Matisse Thybulle: 2.8 steals and 1.8 blocks  Compare that to the career best per 36 numbers (in a single season) of the guys you mentioned and it's up there: Gary Payton:  2.6 steals, .2 blocks  Tony Allen: 3.1 steals, 1.1 blocks  Kawhi Leonard: 2.6 steals, 2.0 blocks"
Kawhi Leonard is the best Player in the league.
There was one ‚Äúreport‚Äù from some nobody saying that the Kawhi Leonard is interested in the Heat lol
Did you really just try to say AD is a better offensive player than Kawhi Leonard?
LaMarcus Aldridge might be unplayable against better playoff teams. Harden and Irving aren't getting over any screens and Aldridge can't do anything but drop. Imagine just giving up open 18 footers to Kawhi Leonard or Khris Middleton
"Why do Spurs fans always say this shit? Lakers were willing to give up Ingram in a trade for Kawhi. Unless Woj is a liar now.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks  &gt;The Lakers are willing to include former No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and a future first-round pick in a package for Leonard, but the Spurs are seeking a far more complete haul of young Lakers players and future picks, league sources said."
"Golden State's salary structure is so bad that the trading Wiseman for a Star talk really doesn't make sense because they would have to move the Andrew Wiggins contract and it would probably cost them an additional asset or two to move it given the salary compared to the play. Just do the mirror test: if you are a Golden State fan, are you really letting go of Steph Curry for James Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins at 60 million over 2 years? Chances are you're not, which means that a hypothetical trade for Karl Anthony towns or kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal probably ain't happening with the assets the warriors have available.   If the warriors get Thompson back healthy, there's a good chance that they can be a competitive team again and if they can't get him back healthy, there's a good chance that they aren't going to be a competitive team again and that's relatively independent of other factors.  The best case scenario for them is that the Minnesota pick conveys to them and then they get Klay back next year and can make a run with their big three while developing their younger players in meaningful games."
"Just for laughs, I would like him to leave. Imagine Kawhi being the guy that goes to a team and then leaves it in absolute ruins. The Spurs lose their playoff streak after he leaves, the Raptors are a bottom team in the east after he leaves (and yes, I'm ignoring all context for this joke scenario), the Clippers traded away their future to put a team around him and then he leaves...  Kawhi Leonard, the Harbinger of Destruction"
"boxscore doesn't tell any story about offensive impact. Chris Paul is much better offensive player. Donovan Mitchell isn't near Kawhi Leonard on this side of the ball either despite similar numbers  but yes, Ben is definetly overhated and i have no idea why. It seems like people are just waiting for his bad games/stretch just to shit on him and spam ""Haha playoffs HCO 2nd round cloging paint keke"""

"compared to... *the expectations*??

If you want to learn more about how that isn't playing out or about the ways Wiseman has regressed since the start of the season, you can listen to Monday's *Lowe Post* episode with Warriors beat writer Nick Friedell. But I warn you, (for us Warriors fans) it's depressing."

"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.

"The NBA has way higher AAV contacts though.  Bryce Harper is making less than Al Horford this year.  Trout, Lindor, and Cole make about the same as Paul George, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard and Tobias Harris.  I was really shocked when Bauer got $102 million over the next three years but that deal has two opt-outs and other crazy stuff."
Jordan would be Kawhi Leonard like from 3pt... Basically will take 4 shots and make just under 2... And average close to 40... He would be averaging 12 free throws a game.
1. Tracy McGrady 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Allen Iverson 4. Larry Bird 5. Michael Jordan 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Chris Paul 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Yao Ming
"Stop losing games, they do that too much. They also would need like kawhi leonard or some 2 way all star player"
"In other words, the actual reporters like Shams Charania have the wrong information on this by saying it wasn‚Äôt seriously considered.   You as a fan clearly know more given how you said ‚Äúto really understand this, you need to take into consideration the personalities involved and their relationships‚Äú. Even though you know nothing about these people personally or their true personalities.   You acknowledge how the Celtics had no use for Tobias Harris, but somehow that‚Äôs a bigger situation to consider than adding Kawhi Leonard.  Sure thing."
"It is a populated position and yet it isn't, because there aren't many players who fit squarely into the 3&amp;D mold.  They can't be too good on offense or they will be more than just 3&amp;D.  Kawhi Leonard started his career as a 3&amp;D player, but now is a bonafide superstar.  Is Klay Thompson a 3&amp;D player?  Some would say he's too good for that as well.  If he's still a 3&amp;D player, he's the best when healthy -- but maybe he's too good.  But they also have to balance excellent and frequent three point shooting with excellent defense, and not be too much of one or the other. The problem is that three point shooting can be volatile.  Robert Covington has always been considered a premier 3&amp;D player, but last year his three point shooting deserted him, as he only hit 33.5% of his threes.  Yet this year he's back near 40%.  The other problem is that catch-and-shoot three point shooters may not score much.  Despite his good three point shooting percentage this year, Covington is mostly a great defender who scores 9 points a game.  He makes one assist and one turnover per game.  So his real contribution on offense is small. How much does a 3&amp;D player have to score to be considered an offensive asset, and if he scores 20 points per game like Klay Thompson is he too good to be called a 3&amp;D player?  I'm just saying it's not easy to define whether someone is a true 3&amp;D players, yet not a star.  Lots of players are loosely placed in that category, but most of them have strengths and weaknesses that makes the classification suspect."
I think his videos showcase that steph is actually a very good defensive guard. But it is true that anchors like Draymond Green will always be more impactful than perimeter guys like Kawhi Leonard.   In the same way that an offensive manipulator like Lebron will always be more impactful than bucket getters like KD.   I guess it‚Äôs because those guys dictate the way a possession will go while the others don‚Äôt really have that level of control. So i can‚Äôt really argue against him on that.
"I agree, but I still think it largely comes back to scouting.  Could Dion Waiters have been something more if he came up with like the Spurs? Sure .  But the Spurs are smart enough go know which guys are worth putting their resources into , and thats ultimately what separates them (and other good organziations) from the basement dwellers.    Theres not many guys who I think wouldve been stars but were held back by whoever drafted them.  And when it does happen, its usually when the team who drafted them simply wasn't giving them enough of an opportunity to shine .    Going back to the Spurs, I feel like Kawhi was going to be a star no matter where he went.  Maybe not the superstar he became, but when a guy is has the tools and self-motivation to improve his game, there is really nothing that can hold him down from rising towards the top one way or another.  A kawhi Leonard drafted by the Kings still wouldve been a star still .  Look at Tyrese Haliburton .  You draft a high IQ player who has a great feel for the game and the ""player development"" becomes less of a talking point,  not even the Kings can screw that up"
"&gt; Do you think he will be good enough to be a positive contributor during the steph/klay/dray window or will the Dubs look to move him for a player that better matches the timeline?  I can't stand how often I see this comment from warriors' fans.  Here's the truth: the steph/klay/dray window is CLOSED.  It's not opening again.  Klay and Dray are 30, and Steph just turned 33.  They won titles in their athletic primes, age 25 - 29 seasons.  There are way too many good teams, with players at the peak of their ability, to be able to leapfrog those teams with an aging steph/klay/dray.    The focus has got to be on getting a great young player (Kawhi Leonard) that jump starts an aging core (Duncan/Parker/Genobili) that can't compete anymore without that young star taking center stage.  The warriors, right now, are the 2008 - 2011 Spurs, the late stage dynasty Spurs, with an aging core looking for a player to be the spark that gets them back to the promised land.    The steph/klay/dray window will not open up again unless Wiseman, or some other young player, becomes a star.  If you trade Wiseman for veteran help now, you've closed that window forever."
"&gt; I literally called AD a star and Draymond a role player. Idk where you got the 1:1 comp. My point was the Ws have multiple potential high impact guys in a series. The Lakers have 2 with a bunch of guys who are slight positives or neutrals.   Schr√∂der, Kuzma and Harrell are not ""slight positives or neutrals"", they're all *really good players*. They would all start on the current Warriors team, without any question.   &gt;And any theoretical trade is including big time draft compensation. Which they should absolutely do.  I'm not sure I agree, but that's one of those decisions you'll only have to judge in hindsight. But we've seen plenty of times that the 50% rebuild, 50% content strategy just doesn't work very well in the NBA.   &gt;As for KAT, I don‚Äôt blame anyone for what happens in Minnesota. Looking at his impact numbers he‚Äôs basically an Audi in a trailer park. Unheard of offensive efficiency from a center. Ws have significant draft capital. Wiseman will carry value for a few years, they own the Wolves pick, their own pick will be a decent selection, then they have two other first in the future to trade and teams have found ways to add bull with pick swaps down the road. Can probably at this point even deal Wiggins to a team with cap for a lightly protected first. He‚Äôs just got two years left on his deal and is actually showing to be a decent player outside of the Wolves. For example, would the Knicks deal a lottery protected first straight up for Wiggins? Wouldn‚Äôt rule it out. Flip that first as well in any deal.   Sure, but then you're literally trading everything you own for a player that isn't in the AD/Kawhi/Harden realm of quality, and that's scary.   That's a decision that makes your GM Exec of the Year if it works, or unemployed if it doesn't. Most GMs prefer a lot safer bets than that.   &gt;The Nets haven‚Äôt won anything yet and are still balancing overall health weekly.   I mean, with COVID being what it is, every single team is balancing health weekly. So this is certainly a season we could see weird shit happens during the playoffs.   &gt;You have to just put yourself in position like the Raptors in 2019 did. Did their Gasol trade make them more talented than GS?  Uh, no Gasol didn't, but Kawhi Leonard being an MVP and DPOY caliber player, probably did?"
"Lmao I can't believe we have fans who still believe this nonsense  Sekou has had the same chances as our other rookies, he's played like complete garbage in every single game this year outside of last night and according to reports, he doesn't remotely impress in practice either.   He's heavy footed and can't beat any competent NBA player off the dribble, he's one of the worst shooters in the league, his handles suck, he's regressed from last year, and he shows nothing compared to our 4 other rookies while being in the league for a longer amount of time.  &gt; Casey has him literally stand in the corner and the team freezes him out  Not really, he has no role because he's not good at anything. Please tell me what role we can use a slow slasher who can't shoot or beat his man whatsoever in.  &gt; His first game as a starter he played good defense on Kawhi Leonard, the next game? Didn't play at all. You literally do not watch games if you think Sekou has been given a chance at all  Ironic that I'm the one who doesn't watch games yet this scenario you've just mentioned literally never happened. Sekou has played against Kawhi once in 19-20, and started the next ~five games where he performed well, then his production dropped off and his will to even play was questioned by Casey as he was showing up lazy as hell to practice and his production was dropping off a cliff. That was also last season and he's gotten worse this year."
"Sekou has not had any chances, what are you talking about? He has a good game then doesn't play at all the next game. Or when he's playing, Casey has him literally stand in the corner and the team freezes him out. His first game as a starter he played good defense on Kawhi Leonard, the next game? Didn't play at all. You literally do not watch games if you think Sekou has been given a chance at all"
"Just for the record and all, those CotY and EotY awards were complete nonsense.  Bird took over a Pacer team that had won 50+ games repeatedly, but struggled to 39 for one season due to injury.  They then won 58 with the same roster, and Bird was given CotY apparently for keeping his players healthy -- no one without his reputation and name wins that.  The EotY was apparently for taking the 37-45 2010-11 Pacers and turning them into the 42-24 2011-12 Pacers.  I guess hiring Frank Vogel was smart, but other guys have done that, too, and Vogel is not exactly Phil Jackson.  He did draft Paul George at #10, but he was unremarkable until years later.  He also drafted Kawhi Leonard at #15, but traded him and Davis Bertans for George Hill -- which didn't look too terrible at the time, but is, ahem, highly questionable today.  [This](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/IND/2012_transactions.html), is Executive of the Year material?"
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"Kawhi Leonard, Scottie Pippen, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan all did to name a few"
Who do you mean by Doc? Doc Rivers? Also when did Ainge take Kyrie‚Äôs word over his?   Which trade at the deadline was even proposed that included Kyrie? From what I remember he wasn‚Äôt even included in talks with New Orleans for AD. [This is what this article says too.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/04/celtics-sheltering-irving-from-the-trade-deadline-whirlwind/amp/)  Even [this source](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2833296-kyrie-irving-rumors-clippers-asked-celtics-about-deadline-trade-got-quick-no.amp.html) says the Celtics gave a ‚Äúquick no‚Äù to the Clippers when they asked about Kyrie. Besides is Tobias Harris and Lou Williams really enough of a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù over Kawhi Leonard?
And you were right to get downvoted lmao. Don‚Äôt act like Hoop Analysis Net got some inside scoop on Kawhi Leonard lol
Kawhi Leonard
"&gt;	You can't compete for a championship and build for the future at the same time, it cannot be done.  Kawhi Leonard won FMVP in his 3rd year on the Spurs. Magic is an even better case. It‚Äôs rare but it can be done"
Lul zero rings and sub 35 wins every year. Jimmy Butler carried your bum ass franchise to the playoffs once and your bum ass team couldn't do shit since them lmaooo. Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green left and the season after was still more successful than all but one of your shit team's years.
There was never a moment at which Kawhi Leonard was a better basketball player than James Harden.
Kawhi Leonard while playing for the Spurs was the most terrifying perimeter defender in the history of the NBA
"Leonard over pippen imo cuz it‚Äôs harder to play defense in this era cuz of rules and lack of physicality compared to 80s/90s. Both are top all time great defenders ever, but imo kawhi and Lebron two of the best overall defenders of this era would be even better back then cuz they could steer guards/wings/smaller bigs with their hands body strength"
"For all-defense (1st or 2nd team), restricting it to just forwards, there's Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Paul George (sometimes), Ben Simmons (sometimes), and this season, LeBron James.  I'd throw Pascal Siakam in there too, but I'm a homer, and our defense this year isn't really good enough to justify it."

"You must accumulate a minimum amount of makes in each category before you can qualify for the 50/40/90 club. Since this season is shortened at 72 games the minimum makes are 264 FGs, 72 3Ps and 110 FTs. Neither Satoransky who hasn't reached half of the minimum makes in any category and especially Snell (with 7 FTs) are close to qualify for the club given their currents rates.   This season the players who seem most likely to make the club are Tobias Harris and Kyrie Irving, after them I'd say that Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard and Khris Middleton are next in line."

"You are voted down but literally everyone around him dwarf him in accomplishments.  Steph had a slow start in his career + he was mediocre defensively + no FMVPs ,(mostly because he was *actually* the no 2 in 2 of their titles in every way measurable). History would be way way less kind to him.  People are incredibly high on him because he is an offensive player + current player. Heck even Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo beat him in personal accomplishments already, but I guess their work in the defensive end is not as flashy.  Contrast him with Moses Malone. A multi MVP with MVPs and presence in all defensive teams. His personal accolades put him in top 15 all time. But most people don't know because they were not around, so they speculatation ignore his dominance.   I think such lists (which are popularity votes), i.e. popular guys go further up in the list, should always be contrasted with sth more objective. I am using a list consisted of personal accomplishments on which I have attached certain weight to tuem (multi fMVP is better than multi MVP which is better than multi DPoY, which is better than multi 1st team selections, etc).  In that list you see legends like Mutombo and in defensive players treated way more kindly and offense only guys to be way more down in the list. Maybe I will post it one day. In such a list Curry is in the top 30s ahead of Nash, which IMO is where he belongs all time. He *is* an improved Nash who got more hype because he played in a more stacked team."
"&gt;Efg% measures efficiency as a scorer not as a shooter.  There is no difference.  You literally cannot score without shooting.  &gt;It‚Äôs also easier to shoot when you‚Äôre much more selective with shot selection.  Not really.  For exactly the same reason that coaches rarely call plays for cold players fresh off the bench, and for the same reason that players warm up before games.  Shooting more is at least as easy.  &gt;Ft% is the best measure of actual shooting as there isn‚Äôt much context that can affect it.  So LeBron James is a bad shooter?  There are many players who can shoot free-throws and not shoot from the field, and vice versa.  &gt;Lonzo is an upgrade but not a huge one, his playmaking is less valuable playing with bron.  I didn't say he was a huge upgrade, first off, but he is a huge upgrade over a couple of guys on that list.  And Davis is not a huge upgrade over Ingram offensively, either.  &gt;You‚Äôre overvaluing how good Anderson, Evans and Gordon were. They‚Äôre all arguably net negative players in NO.  In 2016, they were all positive, while Davis was negative.  This varied year-to-year, but regardless, they were all good enough to be 3-5 guys on a playoff team, with an alleged superstar.  &gt;ADs defense is crucial for la   Against whom?  Even against Denver, the Lakers used Howard and McGee extensively on Jokic, and no one else they played had a threatening center or forward.  And they would not have played Adebayo without Butler.  &gt;and negates any offensive advantage those 3 have(which they don‚Äôt)  Yes, they do, as previously explained -- especially with Butler in the lineup, meaning you are sliding everyone else down a notch.  &gt;No you just don‚Äôt get sign and trades, butler was a free agent.   I fully understand sign-and-trades.  If Butler has a list of destinations, Philadelphia will pick the best offer.  It's moot anyway, since there's no possibility Butler turns down a chance to win with James.  &gt;If butler really wanted to go the lakers they could‚Äôve signed him with their 3rd max slot which they were holding for kawhi anyway a point you completely gloss over this argument and another benefit of the ad trade, they could trade for ad and have a 3rd max slot.  Leonard officially signed with the Clippers 3 days after the Butler and Davis trades, but the decision leaked earlier.  There's no reason Philadelphia had to make that move on that day, and would not have.  How is keeping a spot open for a player who never signed, a benefit?  It's not.  And they only had that space because they gutted their roster in the Davis trade, so you are talking utter nonsense.  &gt;You act like it‚Äôs a given the lakers get him and that couldn‚Äôt be less true.  There's literally no reason [they would not have](https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/1131719730845237248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131719730845237248&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flebronwire.usatoday.com%2F2019%2F05%2F27%2Fjimmy-butler-would-reportedly-like-playing-with-lebron-james%2F).  &gt;So you can trade for other guys, that likely leads to a worse result as you trade a lot  Davis was the most expensive single season rental in basketball history, and maybe in all of sport.  &gt;holiday didn‚Äôt fetch any young players but he did get 3 picks and 2 swaps literally a decade of assets like kd.  2 older players, 2 picks ( not three ), and 2 swaps is not a decade.  The Lakers surrendered 7 players, 3 picks, and a swap for one season of Davis."

"Kevin Durant has played one season of his NBA career without a future, present, or past MVP next to him. That was his rookie season. Since then he's either had Westbrook, Curry, or Harden on his team. When Westbrook was injured in 2013, the KD-led Thunder were up 2-0 on the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs and closed it out 4-2 before losing 1-4 to the Grizzlies the next round.  Title success in the NBA this past decade has been either you have LeBron James, ~~Klay Thompson~~ Steph Curry, or put Kawhi Leonard on a team that could make the conference finals without him."

"I'm riding with Dame because Hulu doesn't just have live sports.  To be serious though, I feel like Dame has always been in the shadows of the his peers (Steph, Westbrook, CP3), but also always been the man in Portland. He has earned the respect of those that doubted him and continue to put up numbers. A place that doesn't necessarily attract free agents. He's been in the playoffs every year and for the most part he's always done more with less. He and CJ are what's good about basketball as far as fighting the food fight. I respect it.   I'm originally from Chicago so I've witnessed Jimmy's ascent and he's protypical example of work ethic and development. He fits in the mold of the Kawhi Leonard and even Paul George types, that made their names on the defensive end and developed into the 2 way wings that are having a Renaissance. Jimmy has grinded, but in all of his stops he's played with better talent on paper whether it be Rose, Wade, Rondo, Gasol in Chicago or Kat, Wiggins, and Rose in Minnesota, or Embiid, Simmons, Horford, Harris in Philly than most of the teammates of Dame. Jimmy showed me some stuff in the Finals, but Dragic and Adebayo damn near carried them during most of that playoff run to get there. Even Herro was killing during the actual playoffs. It's almost like Jimmy had impostors syndrome until a few games in the Finals. Being in Miami he'll have a much better chance in getting free agents based on location alone. I still don't know what that Miami team is because that bubble was fools gold in some instances."

But okay...and Holiday isn‚Äôt on that level of any star I just mentioned. Dude is a 1x all-star.   And what do you mean, wut? I said actually compete. What have y‚Äôall done these last couple years?

"I wouldnt say Curry is the second best player in the league in general though. Although he is definitely an interchangeable Top 5. For me, it would be:   1-Lebron  2-KD  3-Giannis   4- Kawhi Leonard  5- James Harden  My reasoning for why I put KD as second is because he has always been second to Lebron for his entire career. At KD‚Äôs full health you can even debate that he‚Äôs better than Lebron( I dont think that, but people do and thats their opinion), but I see it like this. You have Lebron James and Kevin Durant right next to each other on the same pedestal , and then there‚Äôs everyone else below them. They‚Äôre that dominant.  Now on my list, I put James Harden and snubbed Curry. This is the part where the two are switchable because they are so similar in effectiveness, that you wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to choose one over the other. I got Harden, but I think 80% of people would take Curry over Harden."
Kawhi Leonard 10 times out of 10.
"I think you mean 2015, in 2016 Kawhi had 40 1st place votes more than Draymond.   In 2015 Draymond had 8 1st votes more than Leonard and only 35% of the total 1st place votes. If you only count 1st place votes it would have been the 2nd closest vote this century, with the least amount of votes difference between 1st and 3rd.   It was a 3-way split vote between those 2 and Deandre, with several players getting 2nd votes, even AD getting a bunch of 1st. Kawhi was left out from several ballots too, there are some that have neither of them. It was a very open race.  Draymond had similar advanced stats and impact metrics than Kawhi and he didn't have by far the most 1st place votes. He had a great argument for the DPOY for either year, but I don't think that not winning it was him being robbed.  And it's not unheard of either. In the MVP of 1990 Magic won by having an even bigger deficit with Barkley because of the way Jordan split the vote."

"I give the 76ers a lot of credit for slowing down kawhi Leonard, but also you have to remember that the dude looked hobbled as the series went on. He didn't have the same lift and explosiveness consistently towards the end. I credit injury + ben Simmons as primary defender for slowing down the onslaught he was dishing out  Dude was legit a beast that series, the rest of the Raps looked scared to shoot. Fully carried us that series but we got him back as a team later on"
It was 15. Voters just straight up didn't know he was because they don't watch games and he wasn't a well known player till after that year.   Source: https://www.nba.com/spurs/spurs-kawhi-leonard-wins-2014-15-kia-nba-defensive-player-year-award  Kawhi was on 103 ballots.   Draymond was on 87.
It‚Äôs actually pretty easy. Just trade a player not in Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs universe for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Casey should‚Äôve tried that.
"That‚Äôs cold, just like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard during critical moments in a Clippers uniform"
"One major thing you missed is that a significant portion of superstar ""moves"" aren't free agency signings, but trade requests to big market title contenders. Paul George is only on the Clippers because Kawhi Leonard would only sign with LAC if they made the trade. Anthony Davis is only on the Lakers because he requested a trade from the Pelicans and refused to sign an extension anywhere else, effectively forcing himself to the Lakers. It's ""pre-agency"", not free agency for a lot of superstars.  In addition, it typically isn't the front office that deserves the credit for superstar free agency signings. LeBron James only joined the Lakers because they were in LA - they were the worst team in the league the previous 5 years, seemed mismanaged, and even failed to make the playoffs his first year there.  Conversely, when's the last time a superstar free agent signed to a small market team? LaMarcus Aldridge with the Spurs in 2015? There's significantly less ""skill"" involved in signing superstar free agents compared to the ""luck"" of working in a big market. Respectfully to the Nets, who put up solid teams the past few years - they only got KD and Kyrie because the only other big market team with cap space was the Knicks, who at the time were considered by everyone to be ""lolknicks"". They got James Harden because their only competition was Philly.  **It's hard to feel like those kinds of super teams are ""earned""**. It feels much more special when a 2011 Mavs team wins a ring, or the 2012 Thunder make the Finals with a core of KD-Westbrook-Harden-Ibaka that they drafted. When a team ""lucks"" their way into a super team, opposing fans will complain and discount their success (maybe out of envy?)."
Kawhi Leonard - ring.

Kawhi Leonard.  Rooted for him when he was in the Spurs and Raptors. So it's not team bias.

He also gave Kawhi free accommodations on Wiggins‚Äô island in the Warriors early season come from 21 behind in the third quarter victory against the Clips. I think Leonard was actually the first one on the island this season.
What a battle between The greatest to wear #2 in Raptors history and Kawhi Leonard
"It's close, and if Harden had been able to knock off the Durant Warriors and then presumably defeat the Cavaliers in the finals, I think he would get the slight Edge, but for right now I have to go with Kawhi Leonard"
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."

"Can't believe a Raps fan just said Kawhi is an above average superstar, nah who am I kidding you guys hate him. The players you listed have one thing in common and that's being elite/top players in the regular season.   Westbrook is a legendary player especially since he holds the record for triple doubles. But he still shoots poorly at times and suffered a lot in the playoffs. Ik the sub respects Westbrook right now, but in the early this season ppl were trashing him too.  Lillard is also good but he got swept by a Warriors team without KD in the Conference Finals. People love harping on how Raps won cuz KD and Klay (missed 1.5 games) but Portland got **swept*****.*** Guess how much Lillard averaged that series? 22.3 ppg, only .3 more than CJ did that series. Efficiency was 37/36/88 which makes him look even worse. Blazers losing to the Warriors is not the issue, getting swept while the 2019 Clippers brought a HEALTHY Warriors to 6 games is.  No one doubts Harden's ability to score during the regular season but in the playoffs he couldn't get it done. It wasn't entirely his fault but as is the case with many superstars, you don't get let off easily. He joins a superteam but is playing really well, which leaves me in a weird place.  Where would Durant be if he didn't join the Warriors, where he had the greatest (not hyperbole) backcourt in league history. He's still an elite player but he needed the greater shooter of all time to help him reach that point. And now he's in another super team situation. All stars need a good supporting cast but KD goes overboard.  Other than Durant, the rest of those players fail to show up in the playoffs. They all are big time during the regular season, which as I pointed out, Kawhi doesn't, because of that injury. But did you know, that during Steph's godly unanimous MVP season, guess who was 2nd? Kawhi Leonard. He was also 3rd the year Westbrook won it.   DEFENSE, do you speak it? I literally mentioned numerous times about defense and you keep showing me offensive players. Out of those 4, Durant is probably the best defender. Of course Kawhi can't shoot deep 3s, attack the rim with blistering speed etc. But he's the best two way player in the league. I said it numerous times but like I said, there are not many that are offensively AND defensively as good Kawhi.  One more thing, I noticed you mentioned Giannis as being better than Kawhi. Regular season sure? Playoffs? Nope, purely because Giannis still has the same weaknesses as seasons prior. His FTs have only improved a bit, which is partly because no fans and his 3pt is basically the same as last year. I still want Giannis to win a chip with the Bucks but he has to hope that his opponents won't defend him like the Raps and Heat did.  Kawhi is in weird spot in this debate because he's basically a playoff performer, not a regular season one. He mentioned before that he would like to win MVP so its not like he doesn't care about the regular season but he knows that unlike most injuries, his knees will never be the same."
Please tell me you don‚Äôt mean Kawhi Leonard lol  Ingram is only 23 and is already a star so he‚Äôs too young to be on this list
&gt; Leonard  ...you mean Kawhi? I doubt he's forgotten.  Ingram's too young to put on this list as well.
DAE DOLAN???? bro that's literally it - Dolan??? As if the process era sixers will have anything to show for it.  Can't wait for the Nets to destroy your ass.  trash franchise getting uppity after losing in the second round to Kawhi leonard lmao.
Raptors fans look to Kawhi Leonard as model for OG Anunoby‚Äôs development
"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."
"So if the Clippers were title contenders but the Raptors had a MUCH better season than them, the Raptors were not title contenders? And come on. Bucks were title favourites for the longest time. Bucks were 52-8 at one point (on pace for 70-wins). Raptors outplayed both of them last season and should be given some respect. Raptors were title contenders. Btw second best team in the NBA even tho they just lost Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard."
"Russell Westbrook: 182 triple doubles, more than Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Bob Pettit, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Gary Payton and Kawhi Leonard COMBINED (181)"

There's a level of subjectivity to most sports debates (especially greatest player ever debates) but some things are pretty obvious and more straightforward. No one should entertain a conversation about Damian Lillard being better than Kawhi Leonard or Steph Curry.
"idk how bad it is personally  [LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard playing despite left-hand issue, vows to 'keep fighting through it' (espn.com)](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31418690/la-clippers-star-kawhi-leonard-playing-left-hand-issue-vows-keep-fighting-it)"
"I think Tim Duncan is a top 10 player of all time but putting him in the GOAT conversation is overrating him. Some of those All-nba he got towards the end was when the center position was incredibly weak and he wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. Both of his MVPs where extremely close and he probably should only have won one. Best winrate in the NBA probably has more to do with the fact that he was always surrounded with a good team. What happened after duncan retired? the spurs won 61, 47(kawhi missed the first 27 games), 48 (no Dejounte Murray) games right around 50ish games each season, probably has more to do with pop being a great coach then it does with duncan. Duncan is also the only NBA center to fail to win an Olympic Gold medal -- and the 2004 Team USA he captained was a complete embarrassment, somehow getting blown out by Puerto Rico, which is obviously a US territory. I find Duncan to be overrated on the defensive end, often times he wasn't even the best defender on his own team. He only occasionally was the leading vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners, and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
D. Rose best player on a court with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.
"I agree 100% I think we should judge Wiggins in the playoffs more than the regular season, because he seems to be the type of player Kawhi Leonard is, well not in the same level, but very similar."
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"&gt; Kawhi Leonard  I'm not saying that Wade is top 20, but Kawhi is *certainly* not a top 20 player, yet."
"If it was that easy who does Wade clearly push out of this top 20 list I hastily assembled in two minutes?Nash, Chris Paul, Harden, Barkley, Robinson and others didn't even make the cut...   * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaq * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Kawhi Leonard * Karl Malone"
I'm rooting for the Clippers. Partially because I like Kawhi Leonard. But I also want to see Lakers fans lose their minds.
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."

How do YOU feel about Kawhi Leonard
1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Kevin Durant  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Joel Embiid  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard  this is the objective list. you cannot disagree with me
So how do you feel about Kawhi Leonard? :p
"&gt; One of, Jokic, Dmitch, Booker and Giannis all have just a good of shot to lead their team the the finals this year as Embid. And none of them a top 10 pick.  LMAO. Mitchell isn't ""leading"" his team like Jokic or Giannis are. The Jazz have also not done shit. Same with Booker. Booker might but he's not stepped in the playoffs yet has he.  &gt; Siakam won a chip 2 years ago and Bam helped carry his team to a chip last year.  Siakam won as a great second option. Look at how they lost to the Celtics forcing Lowry to be the man in the clutch instead. Raptors won off the back of incredible team defense, coaching, and Kawhi Leonard.  Miami lost to the Lakers (Bam didn't win a championship) and honestly stood no chance. Put Embiid on that Miami squad and they're way better. Put Embiid on the Raptors squad last year and they're in the Finals."
"Another fun fact: Out of the Top 5 players in the MVP ladder on BR only Kawhi Leonard is from the US. The others are Jokic, Embiid, Giannis and Luka. If you look at the Top 10 its 4 Americans and 6 Internationals."
"You don't think playing opposite Kawhi goddamn Leonard just might have opened things up for him? Look, Siakam is not a useless player at all, and he is a big ""rhythm"" type of player, as we see in this thread, he had a huge game. But if you need him to read a defense and make the right play, it's never going to happen. His athleticism is through the roof, but he doesn't have a repertoire of skills to utilize it, it's just how it is. If you make him handle the ball and clog up driving lanes, he's VERY limited."

"""I just hope that when the time comes, you have someone like I did. Someone who can plunge their hands into the FILTH... so that you can keep yours clean.""  - Kawhi Leonard, 2020"
"He‚Äôs still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he‚Äôs a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can‚Äôt do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to ‚Äúthey want to speed up the pace.‚Äù That‚Äôs true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
"That is pretty much what being the second option is. It literally means ""the second option to score"". Siakam in the 2019 Playoffs averaged 16.0 Field Goals Attempted per game, second on the Raptors behind Kawhi Leonard (20.7 FGA/G) and ahead of Kyle Lowry (11.6 FGA/G). Tell me, how can you take 4.4 more shots per game than the third highest on the team and literally double of the fourth most on the team (Serge Ibaka, 6.0 FGA/G) and you not be the second option?  Imagine lying about Siakam being the second option when he was LITERALLY the second scoring option on the Raptors."
"I wouldn‚Äôt compare a legendary defensive specialist like Leonard to George.... Kawhi is right there with the MJ‚Äôs and Payton‚Äôs of the world. The Claw = The Glove. Kawhi even has a patented defensive move.... the strip, break, dunk. One of the most beautiful defense to offensive moves I‚Äôve ever seen. Every time he does it I love it. Even crazier is he starts that play mid court almost every time. It‚Äôs nearly unstoppable. But to me as a defensive minded player. There‚Äôs nothing more sexy than the chase down block... oh boy! I love me some Lebron. Davis‚Äôs amazingly common jump shot block is pretty nuts too. A rare one is the block and grab... boy that‚Äôs a tough one rarely done."
The answer is Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis.
It's Kawhi Leonard.
Transbronsexuals= Lebron haters  Jordashians = Jordan fans Currystani Radicals = Curry fans  KD= snake  Pandemic to Pfizer P= Paul George  Nursing shoes = Kawhi Leonard
Andre Iguodala and Kawhi Leonard enter the chat
"Raptors when most of the games Leonard sat, so they would maybe have 1 or 2 more wins had Kawhi played more."
"Of course. A start would be signing Kawhi this off-season which is unlikely. Perhaps sign Lonzo as well. If done, they can give up a bunch of assets for KAT (Toppin, Robinson, 3 FRP?) I think that would make a super team  PG: Ball, Rose? SG: Barrett, Quickley SF: Leonard, ? PF: Randle, ? C: Towns, ?"
"I can't believe in 2021 people are still saying this about Kawhi. I thought this sub was better than this. You guys really disappoint me with your lack of sensitivity and awareness, it just blows my fucking mind. To call Kawhi Leonard a robot is offensive and demeaning. The proper term is android or automaton."

"I‚Äôve tried and tried, but I just can‚Äôt get myself to hate Kawhi Leonard. Dude is unintentionally hilarious üòÇ"
"Fuck that, I'll click anything for Kawhi Leonard."
"He averages 4.8 shots per game at the rim this year. That's not a lot by any means, but is on par with Luka Doncic, Anthony Davis and more than Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard and Devin Booker. Is that a good enough sample size for you?"
"&gt; Laughable that a back to back MVP is better than Kawhi?  Yes, laughable. Did you just forget the fact that his performance has declined precipitously in two consecutive postseasons specifically because of huge flaws in his game?   &gt; Embiid was the 2nd best player in that 2019 series   Yes, and if he had averaged more than like 17 PPG on 36% shooting they might've won.   &gt; Butler doesn't take the regular season seriously, but there's a reason he had two historically great games against the Lakers in the Finals. He played better in those games, on the biggest stage, than Kawhi has ever played.  Your evidence is 2 postseason games? Kawhi Leonard has like an all-time great postseason peak spanning over 60 games and 4 playoffs."
Am I supposed to believe that Kawhi Leonard hasn't spent hours researching quicksand on the internet?  Unrealistic commercial.
"""Why does quicksand work so slowly"" -Kawhi Leonard"
Its crazy cuz [he just went on insta live to announce a song hes on with NBA Youngboy and Rod Wave.](https://www.complex.com/music/kawhi-leonard-announces-culture-jam-music-project-teases-youngboy-never-broke-again-rod-wave-collab)
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard would like a motherfucking word ‚Ä¶ James Harden wants to speak to you too"
"He had to start Greg Monroe in a game and had no bench whatsoever. What rotation issues did you have?   His main problem was that Kawhi Leonard shot a million percent from midrange, and that without Embiid on the court his choices at center were Amir Johnson and Greg Monroe. Nurse Had Serge Ibaka or Marc Gasoline at all times.   Losing the series is a cop out, if you want to criticize his coaching then actually criticize it."
He did. The raptors also had an excellent roster and kawhi was simply unstoppable.  Can you objectively say he had the better roster when the Raptors were one of the best teams in the east for years and then added Kawhi Leonard?
"Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler,  Giannis Antetekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, and Nikola Jokic.  Didn‚Äôt overthink it. These are just the 5 most productive players of the season statistically on playoff teams, so this takes out Zion for missing the playoffs, and then Embiid misses out because of the position rules and being ranked behind Jokic."
"well I think it‚Äôs why they have paul george and kawhi leonard, probably why they got chris paul too"
Kawhi Leonard has 1 triple double in his entire career... and he‚Äôs someone that was being talked about as an all time great if he won the title with the Clippers last year. Some dumbasses like Colin Cowherd will put Leonard in their all time starting 5 line up while acting like Westbrook is a net negative player lol.
Kawhi leonard as cyborg  Paul George as Booster Gold   Russell Westbrook as the the dazzler   Dame lillard as cat woman   Kevin love as night crawler  Chris Paul as Wonder Woman   Karl Anthony towns as  hawk girl    Trae young as moon knight   Luka as squirrel girl  Boogie cousins as also cat woman for some reason
Kawhi Leonard and Lonzo Ball.
"Spurs 2016-2017  With Kawhi Leonard off the floor with L. Aldridge + T. Parker on the floor: 104 offensive rating  With Kawhi Leonard on the floor with L. Adridge + T.Parker off the floor:  120 offensive rating  Don't get me wrong, Westbrook absolutely played good enough to win MVP, I just think Kawhi played equally as good."
He might be able to win a championship if you pair him with somebody like Kawhi Leonard.
Yeah against Kawhi Leonard and without KP and Brunson
"Your point was that Duncan choked but he didn‚Äôt. Kawhi Leonard choked and missed the FTs to put it away. Game 7 wasn‚Äôt a choke, game 6 was. And the Spurs were winning with Duncan on the court, they choked with him on it. Your point was fucking stupid."
"Yes, because the 2013 spurs, with Tim Duncan Tony Parker Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard with multiple good to great role players were a ""mediocre team"""
‚Äú[OC] i used machine learning to figure out if Kawhi Leonard is still a locker room cancer‚Äù
"Kawhi Leonard is dealing with an ACL injury, but how bad is it?   Sources have revealed to AllClippers that Kawhi Leonard is dealing with an ACL sprain and that he will likely miss the rest of the series against the Utah Jazz.  Leonard's last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster, to say the least. After defeating the Utah Jazz in Game 4 on Monday, Leonard told reporters that he was ""all good"" in regards to sitting out the final minutes of Game 4 because of a knee collision after Joe Ingles fouled him. AllClippers reached out to sources who confirmed that Leonard also told teammates that he was ""all good."" His statement to the media wasn't just a front, Kawhi actually believed that he was all good."
How the F is Kawhi Leonard and Giannis so low on the list? That's honestly the most baffling thing about that chart.
Man really said playoff Donovan Mitchell is basically the same as 2x FMVP 2x NBA champion kawhi leonard
I‚Äôd say It‚Äôs a little too soon to call him a great coach. I‚Äôd call him an improving coach.   The clippers still play a lot of standing around basketball with little off ball movement / execution.  In my opinion great coaches make sure there‚Äôs a plan every trip down the floor.  Right now it‚Äôs more of the get the ball to your best player and get out of the way kind of deal which in my opinion only gets you so far.. unless your Kawhi Leonard or KD....    A team being on that ‚Äònext level‚Äô of play/coaching is like old golden state warriors or the Duncan era spurs under pop. Where talent meets off ball movement and execution
We got Kawhi Leonard at home

[Woj] Breaking: Kawhi Leonard to be euthanized Thursday after ACL tear diagnosis
"so bad karma for something that may not have even happened how you describe it leads to a ""deserved"" *checks notes* ACL injury to Kawhi Leonard"
[Lots of issues.](https://www.3cbperformance.com/blog/kawhi-leonard-knee-injuries-load-management)
"Yeah, I'm familiar with this story. He wasn't dunking and it was against all medical protocol. Here's the reality, Kyle Lowry was 19 years old at this time, not 29. And  he had clearly built enough strength in his posterior chain that he didn't even need to rely on an ACL. But he was playing with fire and in college. If you're paying an athlete 32 million dollars, you don't let him play with fire.  This is the [same shit that Dejuan Blair](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/11/how-can-dejuan-blair-play-without-an-anterior-cruciate-ligament-in-either-knee.html) had. He had zero ACLs in either knee but he was playing NBA basketball. He'd built the strength and was young enough that his brain was able to build the proprioception to function without ACLs. The term used to describe this is  ""ACL coping.""  If Kawhi Leonard has anything beyond a grade 1 sprain or requires surgical intervention, he will not be playing basketball for 6-8 months and won't return to the NBA for 9-12 months."
"To quote Kawhi Leonard from the post game interview last night ‚Äúnah, I‚Äôm good‚Äù"
The unintelligible demon voice was actually saying ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard hurt his knee‚Äù this whole time!

"No, I mean people think they're smarter than Kawhi Leonard because they would have signed a long term deal."
"This is the worst NBA season ever. So many injuries and season ending injuries, from Jamal Murray to now Kawhi Leonard.  Hopefully this is a lesson to people in NBA management that this type of condensed schedule should not be repeated."
"What is leolle, you mean Leonard? If that is the case, I want KD and Nets to win so your point doesn't hold anyway. It is not about Kawhi coming back (and his situation isn't even clear right now whether it is a strain or tear.). It is about preventing further injuries. And this season is nothing like other seasons so comparisons doesn't make sense.   I still wonder why you called this soft? As fans, we shouldn't car about player health?"
Kyrie played only 20 games last year and only 54 this year.  Kawhi Leonard played only 57 games last year and only 52 this year  James Harden played only 44 games this year and intentionally came into camp out of shape.  All players got three months off last year from March to July and then another two months off after.  Sometimes people just get hurt.
Tomorrow: Kawhi Leonard has both legs amputated. Out indefinitely.
"&gt;Are Embiid and Jokic not skilled because they're huge? Embiid has great post moves, can shoot the mid-range, and can shoot the 3 well. Jokic is a great shooter and one of the best passers the league has ever seen.   Are you in the habit of putting up strawmen?  &gt;No fucking shit them being huge plays a part in it but it's that in combination with their skill that make them so great.   Is it no fucking shit? Seems like lots of people are objecting to the comparison. I'm just saying what took Shaq from great to one of the best is his size. I actually never said Shaq had no skill. No clue why that's controversial. If Kevin Durant was 6 foot, would he be as good a scorer? Probably not. If Kawhi Leonard didnt have enormous hands, would his defence be as good?"
"Honestly though, the Clippers getting to the Finals without Kawhi Leonard would be awesomely impressive and make some gambler very, very happy."

"According to the team, for anyone who follows the clippers, they keep their injury reports intentionally vague. They listed serge like doubtful instead of out and he had bacl surgery the day of   I just hope it's only a sprain and hoping for the best outcome for kawhi Leonard"
"There's two absolute facts about Kawhi: He plays for himself and his family/associates only and he's a great player.   So, with any sort of injury that may take money from himself or his family in the future, I will let you guess how many more playoff games he participates in this year.  Just to be clear, I have no issue with what Leonard has shown. You, me, the media, the Clippers fans - not a single one of us is in Kawhi's head when he goes to sleep. Not a single one of us will be with him for the next 40-50 years. So, hey, more power to him. But if you think he's playing again this season, you are on a different fucking planet from reality."
"While it's great the injury isn't more serious, this all but confirms he's out the rest of this series and if we somehow make it past the Jazz (which I acknowledge is very unlikely), you'd have to imagine he misses at least most of the WCF. And if he does return, it likely won't be the same assain we've seen all playoffs.  Just terrible, and another example of the clipper curse living on. We really started to click these last 2 home games and were legitimately looking like championship contenders. No bron, no steph, a banged up Nets squad...this was our year to take it.  Ty Lue has been amazing at adjustments all playoffs so I'm keeping hope alive...hopefully PG plays like the superstar he was during the Indiana years and every role player steps up. Safe to say there is no replacing Kawhi Leonard though"

"Yes, Kawhi Leonard was born with the mind of a r/nba/newphew and thinks exactly like this"
"If I was God, I'd give Kawhi leonard two adamantium knees so he can play game 6 :("
Kawhi Leonard has only played more than 66 games twice.
Annnnd.  Just like that kawhi Leonard is out for game 5 and looks likely to miss the rest of the series. Sooo. Looks like you have an in with God and he also hates the clippers
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
"I would say I disagree with him. Giannis been cooked by KD before and it doesn't seem like he manages to slow KD down anymore than PJ tucker does.  He's not as lateral agile , doesn't have the defensive footwork kawhi leonard has for example to make up for some of that lateral deficiency."
[This article](https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/03/07/kawhi-leonard-olympics-gregg-popovich/) stating Kawhi would go was from March of *this year*.  That means he had this extended and compressed season going for a championship in mind while also planning to play in the Olympics.
Kawhi Leonard is better at rebounding and defense overall outside of rim protection.
"No, Leonard Whiting, the actor who played Romeo in 1968. He was a god-cousin to Kawhi Leonard (also named Leonard) for many years"
"You think that Kawhi Leonard, the same guy that said he didn't even know his own team was getting criticized earlier in the playoffs, is going to drop 40 next game because he is suddenly hearing talks about KD being the best?"
"KD is a better scorer, shoots more efficiently from the three, from mid-range, from inside, from the free-throw line, a better playmaker, a better rebounder, and a better time protector and you're out here saying it's laughable to say KD is better? Stop it. Kawhi is a better perimeter defender. That is literally the only thing he is better at that KD. KD just dropped 49 which is more than kawhi Leonard has ever scored. As a matter of fact.. Leonard has three 40 point games, Kevin Durant has over 60 while missing a substantial time with various injuries throughout his career. So really, if you really want to look at it.. it's laughable to say that Kawhi Leonard is better"
"Kawhi Leonard is 29 years old. If I'm starting a franchise it's Kawhi.  If it's winning a championship in one season either one is amazing but I'd still take Kawhi for the elite defense + elite offense, Durant is better offensively but Kawhi barely edges him out with the two way impact for me"
Kawhi Leonard gonna have issues with this on the finals.
LA and it‚Äôs straight up not close lmao   PG: Lebron   SG: PG-13   SF: Kawhi Leonard   PF: AD  C: Ibaka
It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me either. Like do they not have shooting coaches? Kawhi Leonard wasn‚Äôt a great shooter until they reworked his shot. Same with Lonzo and BI. It‚Äôs insane that Giannis shot has actually regressed. I remember his shot being a lot smoother when he just came into the league. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs put on so much muscle that he‚Äôs lost flexibility and can‚Äôt shoot a one motion shot and now has to shoot a 2 motion shot like LeBron or the rumor that Jason Kidd broke his shot while he was coaching him is true.
Kawhi Leonard to the Bucks confirmed. /s
Leonard over Lillard? WTF Kawhi only played 52 games
He reminds me a lot of Kawhi Leonard in his 3rd year in the league when he won a championship with the Spurs in a couple ways (not playstyle or position). He was a great two way player who didn't score a lot of points because he wasn't asked to but played good defense and was efficient with offense when he did score.  Both also have insane potential with length and/or athleticism. He wasn't considered the best player in  his draft yet as most redrafts around this time had him around 3/4 along with Chandler Parsons. Ayton is a two way player with lots of untapped potential and I think he will continue to rise in his draft class redrafts from where most consider him now.
I haven‚Äôt denied that Kawhi was godly in other games but having multiple underwhelming performances in important/must win playoff games matters. If your telling me Kawhi Leonard is better than Kevin Durant then im gonna factor that in.
"He would have never faced the Warriors in 2015 if McHale didn't bench him in Game 6 against the Clippers and Josh Smith + Corey Brewer carried him. 2016, he played the Warriors without Steph Curry and still got his shit beat in. 2017, he gets blocked by geriatric Ginobili and in an elimination game without Kawhi Leonard, he went 2/11 from the field with 6 turnover and fouled out in the worst game from a superstar in history. 2018, he was the driving force behind a team who set a record in most missed shots in NBA history. In 2019, he couldn't beat a Warriors team with the best player in the world not playing. And in 2020, he once again got run off the court by the Lakers after demanding Chris Paul get traded for his buddy Westbrook."
"Kawhi has shown you and told you for years now that he gives a fuck about no one except Kawhi Leonard and his closest associates.  If you like that, then cool. But don't fucking root for him this season or any other season against LeBron or KD or CP3 or any other star player that's been on multiple teams just because Kawhi quietly says ""fuck you."""
"I'm disappointed too and here's why: it's not that he can't shoot. I'm okay with that. You can manage that with good team building and a little luck with match ups.  What you cannot do is have no ability to score in the half court. He needs a post move, a hook shot, a James Harden-jump-into-defenders move that he can go to 3 feet from the basket, *something* to get points when his generationally talented co-star needs help. And he has no move for generating half court offense.  You can be the best passer in the world, but if you can't get a bucket in the half court your team is going to be playing 4 on 5 on that end. And no matter how great you are defensively, at most you can make the game 4 on 4 on the defensive end (by completely shutting down your man, a la 2017 Kawhi Leonard). That math won't win a title, and that's why he frustrates me."
"Its not completely unfounded, he's shown a lot of development recently and he's still only 23.  This past season he averaged 16ppg on 60%TS, 40% from 3. Over the second half of the season he was averaging over 18ppg on slightly better efficency.   Obviously he has a lot more development to make, but his numbers at 23 and his overall development thus far is very similar to Kawhi Leonard.  Personally I don't think he makes the jump to elite offensive superstar that Kawhi made later in his career, but I think the version of Kawhi that won finals MVP is an apt comparison for him"
"He'll be the guy who does a few short radio spots the week of the NBA Finals. There are always retired HoFers who go on random talk shows advertising some product during the Finals.  ""Alright so up next we're bringing in HoFer and NBA Legend Kawhi Leonard to get his thoughts. Kawhi is here with us today because of Gold Bond and their new extra strength powder. Welcome to the show Kawhi. What do you think of this Finals matchup?"""
"""Fuck Twitter"" - Kawhi Leonard"
"Kawhi Leonard vs the sixers in that series was the single most dominant player I‚Äôve ever seen, he was able to take over games. I don‚Äôt think anyone was stopping that team that year"
"most want to win down the line  1. Atlanta Hawks 2. Los Angeles Clippers 3. Philadelphia 76ers 4. Milwaukee Bucks 5. Phoenix Suns 6. Brooklyn Nets 7. Utah Jazz  From the Southeast, then it's basically by players, I enjoy Kawhi Leonard and Joel Embiid/Tobias Harris more than the others."
ESPN once Kawhi retires:  ‚ÄúDoes Kawhi Leonard hate basketball?!?‚Äù
I think Kawhi Leonard is pretty good at basketball
"because [this](https://contents.spin.ph/image/resize/image/2021/06/15/kawhi-leonard-1623733818.webp) is the type of shit you‚Äôd see on a poster, hence ‚Äúposterized‚Äù  if you‚Äôre not impressed by a man jumping 40+ inches and dunking with that force, as if the defender isn‚Äôt even there, then idk what to tell you"
Or the Rockets losing by 39 at home to the Spurs who were playing without Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker?
"Kawhi ""Scorching The Net"" Leonard"
"Kawhi ""Surfing The Net"" Leonard"
"Yeah wtf does he care, he's not really a Clipper, he's Kawhi Leonard. I don't say that with any malice towards him but it's just slowly becoming the reality in the league where teams are becoming of secondary importance to players. On the one hand, fuck the billionaire owners, let the guys doing all the work reap all the rewards, and I refuse to condemn players moving around as they please when owners trade these guys without a second thought. On the other hand, I think at it's core the NBA is about fandom to a specific team. Stars get twitter followers but teams get die-hard fans who make the product fun to watch in the playoffs. I think it's fair to say this is a problem while also acknowledging that it's not the players' fault"
Pretty dick move that he did here. Recruited to Jimmy Butler to the Heat so his Jazz wouldn‚Äôt have to play the Clippers or Lakers with Butler in the playoffs. Now Jimmy is stuck playing with Tyler Herro instead of Kawhi Leonard.
"If I were to guess a current player who refers to it as ‚Äúthe Web‚Äù, my guess would‚Äôve been Kawhi Leonard"
"Kawhi ""Did I mention I don't have social media"" Leonard."

Watch the clippers game harden played in when he was in Houston. Bro had a healthy westbrook too and they were throwing Paul George and Kawhi fucking Leonard at him at half court.
"Except its not, this is reality.  Kawhi Leonard was the best player in that series, anyone who thinks he wouldn't have made a difference in helping the Clippers win that series is tripping.  He was posting the best PER as well throughout that point.  That's like saying, eh we don't know if Kyrie stayed healthy if it would have made the Nets beat the Bucks."
"&gt; The Spurs had a 99.4 drtg without Duncan on the floor in 2004, as opposed to a 93.9 when he was on the floor.  That doesn't necessarily mean that Duncan was a better defender, it probably means a 24 year old Hedo Turkoglu is a better defender than a 33 year old Robert Horry. Tim Duncan goes to the bench, is replaced with an old Horry and more points get scored than if Bowen is replaced with a younger Turkoglu. Not only that but Duncan only played 69 games and Bowen played all 82. This is also why Garnett got first team, he played all 82 games. I agree that the voters don't always get it right but Duncan only got 8 points from the voters that year(the voters can't be THAT wrong) and he finished 7th in voting, no way did duncan deserve DPOY in 2004. For comparison, Bowen finished 4th in voting and got 76 points. Presumably the majority of those voters watched most of those games and they clearly thought that Bowen was a more important defender.   &gt;Either way, Duncan had 15 all defensive team selections in his career. That‚Äôs as many as Robinson and Kawhi combined. He probably has the lowest defensive rating of any great player all time. No way I buy that Duncan just benefitted from playing next to great defenders.  I'm not saying that Duncan wasn't good defensively, just that he wasn't better than Robinson or Leonard when they played together and certain seasons he wasn't as good as Bowen. It's not surprising that he has as many all nba defensive teams as Robinson and Leonard. Leonard has been very injury prone and Robinson had some serious defensive competition from some all time great defensive centers. But most of the seasons they played with Duncan they were the better defenders.  Like I said before both Robinson and Leonard anchored #1 rated Spurs defenses without Duncan, the closest Duncan came without those three guys was 8th. The Spurs defenses weren't that great when Duncan was the top dog and he had no other teammate getting DPOY votes. He definitely benefited from having good defensive teammates."

"&gt;You said kobe was only a plus defender for 4 years... And you said curry has been a plus defender since 2015... Getting yourself mixed up here aren't ya?  How am I getting mixed up? Yes.

You changed the wording because you don't know what ""plus defender"" means because you're clearly full of shite.  &gt;You literally described them both as plus defenders. Implying they are on similar levels.  No. It implies nothing. They're plus defenders. Kawhi Leonard is a plus defender also but he's clearly way better than either of those guys defensively. Youre really exposing yourself here.   &gt;You're right, everyone puts kobe top 10 or JUST outside, fucking noone puts curry top 10... And the downvotes in your list show people ain't agreeing...

"This is the allegation btw  &gt;Wilkes, who reportedly claims to be the best friend of Leonard's uncle Dennis Robertson, lays out how he supposedly pushed Leonard to sign with the Clippers in the letter, which was apparently presented to West two weeks after Leonard joined the Clippers.  &gt;In the letter rife with spelling errors, Wilkes claims to have spent $200,000 on travel expenses to pursue networking opportunities, all part of a ""Bring Kawi [sic] Home"" initiative.

"Granted none of these guys said it with a cute ESL accent but‚Ä¶.  Steph Curry on his 62 point game:  ‚ÄúYou try to just continue to stay humble and stay in the moment. That's the best way to approach it.‚Äù  Steph Curry on his pregame ritual:  ‚ÄúThe past is behind us and the future is in front of us, so we stay right in the middle, in the moment.

"""Kawhi Leonard going crazy"" -Mike Breen"
Kawhi Leonard ruined it for a lot of people. Now everyone thinks shooting is very easy to learn.
"I was about to comment this:  ‚ÄúLol why would people act like he‚Äôd be KD 2.0. KD had a jumper, you can‚Äôt just learn to be as good of a shooter as KD that late.‚Äù  And then I thought about Kawhi Leonard"
"I still maintain that we got absolutely fucked by CP3+ the players associations refusal to smooth out the massive cap spike in 2016. We had Dame, CJ, Crabbe, Meyers Leonard, and Moe Harkless all hitting the market around that time. We handed out some bad contracts but it would have been brutal to just let all our young talent walk over 2 offseasons just to avoid overpaying.  As a demonstration to how much we were fucked, the Spurs were able to sign Kawhi to a ~17mil/yr contract in 2015, which I believe was the max at the time. The following year we gave Dame a max extension at more than 25 mil/yr, and the following year we had to give CJ nearly as much. Imagine how much cap flexibility we would have had if Dame and CJ were making a combined 35 mil/yr, instead of nearly 60."
What? Luka put up godly numbers while involving his teammates and being guarded in stretches by Kawhi fuckin Leonard and Paul George lmao not even close and booker is 25
"I was told Cp3 being out was far more impactful than Kawhi Leonard, who was a top 3 player in the playoffs lol."

I take it you're a Kawhi Leonard fan
"My dude the suns played against clippers missing KAWHI LEONARD AND SERGE IBAKA..   Kawhi was having a legendary post season before he got hurt..ibaka would've made it even easier for kawhi to score cause ibaka would force ayton to the 3 pt line.

I'm sorry but when 2 of 3 of the best players in ur last 3 series are hurt, those stats don't mean shit lmao"
"I remember a couple of years ago he was asked something to the effect of why doesn't he train with players on other teams in the off-season. He said something like why would he train with them when they're his opponents.   &gt;He told¬†The Athletic: ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt work out with you in the summer and then play you in a few months. It feels weird. It doesn‚Äôt feel right with me. Like other players, it‚Äôs cool for other players, but I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to. Other guys do it. ‚ÄòI feel like with LeBron and KD [Kevin Durant], KD did that to LeBron. Take a lot of his thoughts and use it against him.

But because he doesn't train with them he doesn't build the same relationships. Like most of those guys grew up playing AAU ball together. Giannis didn't and he's also not into training, so he really isn't making friends.   I absolutely love his way of thinking. If other players don't give him props and go to his games then it's whatever. It doesn't seem to phase him."

Honestly even Anthony Davis isn't enough imo. I think you need Kawhi Leonard and even then it's 50/50 at best and arguably still worse.
Kawhi Leonard
"Yes because their team had got significantly worse, cp3 wasn't even close to playing at the same level.   Just live with it man, the warriors got very very lucky over their run, it happens.  And that luck ran out in 2019.   2015 - All 4 series had the opponents missing key players, including Kyire and love both injured in the finals, still went 6 games.  2017 - Kawhi Leonard gets hurt  2018 - Cp3 gets hurt when up 3-2  And in 2017 and 2018 the cavs team coming out the east was a very weak one.   Then finally in 2019 your luck runs out, you get the injuries and lose to the raptors, become the worst team in the entire league in 2020 and miss the playoffs in 2021."
The clippers were literally throwing Paul George *and* Kawhi Leonard at him at once. Two all-nba defenders (one of which is a DPOY) and it barely slowed the guy down.
"On a scale of 2020 James Harden to 2019 Kawhi Leonard, how gone is this mf?"
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
Dallas could just be doing this to ensure that the price on Kawhi stays high and the clippers don‚Äôt try to take a couple million off for him sitting a whole year.  If you believe the reports that some NBA teams tried to undercut KD‚Äôs money due to his injury then it‚Äôs not entirely out of the question that the Mavs want the Clippers pockets to be a thin as possible by being a team that Leonard can always fall back on if LA tries that.
"Are you a gen z? Have you read my reply in your previous comment? You must be just looking at stats to have that type of opinion. Magic played like 1B as a rookie to Kareem's 1A and as the saying goes, the best ability is availability. Yes, KAJ was the best player on the team but with him being out, it was understandable for Magic to get the FMVP. It does not determine who the best player is on the team, it just shows who made the most impact on that finals (you may argue however you want but Magic deserved that FMVP). Is Andre Igoudala the best player on the 2015 Warriors? Is Kawhi Leonard the best team on the 2014 Spurs? No? There's your answer. Getting an individual award does not particularly say ""you are this and he is that"" and if that was the case, LeBron would have won MVP from 2012 to 2016 come on man."

"I was planning on taking my niece and nephew to the movies on my day off tomorrow and I asked them if they wanted to see Space Jam, they said ""NO! We want to see Minions:"" the new 1, The Rise of Gru. I think it's because my niece and nephew are between the ages 5 and 8 and they never really watched Looney Tunes and they don't care about LBJ, but they seen the minions movies üôÑ. My nephew likes Kawhi Leonard since he played for the raptors"
"I love Jaylen Brown the person and player, but man, he is overrated amongst Celtics fans.   He is much closer to being the next Khris Middleton than the next Kawhi Leonard.   I swear a lot of our fans don't really want to win a championship. Making 2 ECFs isn't some guarantee of future success like our fans seem to think it is."
"\&gt;He broke Kyrie's Cavs records for most 3pters made by a rookie.   \&gt;He broke LeBron's Cavs record of most 20 + point games as a rookie, and most consecutive 20 + point games to open a season this year.   \&gt;This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others).  \&gt;Are those all tradeable mediocre players too?  &amp;#x200B;  This isn't ""statistical refutation"" as much as it's post-editing in data-picked factoids that I don't give a fuck about. You still completely refuse to cope with the reasoning as to why the franchises that owned the 22 year old versions of those players wouldn't have dreamed on not extending them, which is so much more telling about what you deep-down know to be true about Sexton's value as a player.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;It's almost as if they need additional pieces to help flesh out their scoring, and like they need a tandem of JAllen, Okoro, and Mobley to provide a solid defensive wall to back up their height disadvantage (and provide some great pick n roll targets).  &amp;#x200B;  If Mobley falls to them, there's probably a slight chance they extend Sexton. I still think they'd much rather re-sign Allen who can fit next to Mobley, and keep that cap space free while rolling with a Garland-Mobley facilitated offense.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;And you're right when have members of the sports media ever been wrong ! /  &amp;#x200B;  What does this even mean? In instances where there is this much consensus smoke, they are right very often.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;Cavs aint the ones trying to shoot loads of cum to hype Sexton for a trade. We just recognize what we have and can provide the stats to prove it. Which is what Ive done consistently and only gotten random opinions in response where no one has yet to explain how we replace our #1 scorer and the 25 ppg and spacing, and gritty infectious attitude, he brings w mid-level draft picks and Obi. No one.  &amp;#x200B;  You can only provide the same singular stat, PPG, and his eFG% and TS% which at least have trended towards league average for a SG that only averages about 4 3PAs a game. You ignore his tendency to ball-stop and really bad defensive fit which help contribute to a bad Net Rating and awful team relative on/off numbers. You also ignore a bad Ast/TO ratio and mediocre Ast% which is discouraging for someone who can reliably break down the defense as much as he can.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;But please give me more opinions I can refute with stats.  You've refuted literally none of my opinions with stats, because my collective feelings towards Sexton already acknowledge that he is developing into a nice three-level scorer capable of being a sole offensive option on a really bad team. It is his holistic package as a player that I am not very interested in.  \&gt;I got karma to burn so prove me wrong w stats or gtfo  &amp;#x200B;  ""muh downarrows"" is cringe enough without ignoring the fact that I'm the one displaying unpopular dislike for a young player that I think has been erroneously labeled as someone that meaningfully moves a team towards championship contention.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't even know why you're taking such offense to this. I'm trying to argue that your team is smart for, rumors have it, choosing not to extend Donovan Mitchell money to a potentially worse version of Donovan Mitchell and for seeing the limited value in that type of player."
Kawhi Leonard going GOAT mode
"You can have his shitty defense and hero ball. He‚Äôs no Kawhi Leonard, and Toronto Bay isn‚Äôt getting him without sending Pascal to Portland. He‚Äôd be in the same position there. Portland‚Äôs not going to tank the franchise for some whiny diva who thinks Twitter is real life. Dame is acting like he hasn‚Äôt played a major role in the mediocrity due to his ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù crap and wanting Stotts around for almost a decade because Terry gave Dame free reign to do as he pleases."
"Kawhi just got surgery on his ACL, he will barely play the next season. In my opinion Leonard will never be the same, still good, just not championship good."
"All of those stats / accolades are pretty cherrypicked and none of them contradict the comment above you since they're all related to scoring. Maybe you should've looked for something that suggests he's not a terrible defender/passer  &gt; This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others)  This is just obnoxious and could be done with any 1st option player in the league"
Go full force and try to lure Kawhi Leonard. He might go there if he leaves the Clippers since he doesnt want to leave California

"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot‚Äîand Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee‚Äôs impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven‚Äôt won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship r√©sum√©s, seeing all these new faces on the league‚Äôs biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul‚Äîthese Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we‚Äôre getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography‚Äîelevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdown‚Äù year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he‚Äôs not among the NBA‚Äôs peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he‚Äôs only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he‚Äôs playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis‚Äôs signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday‚Äôs game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it‚Äôs astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis‚Äôs blunt power‚Äîthese stars may be dissimilar, but that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it‚Äôs tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee‚Äôs, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on ‚ÄúBooker game‚Äù everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points‚Äîthough playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee‚Äôs Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they‚Äôre now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn‚Äôt see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There‚Äôs no asterisk to this title. There‚Äôs been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I‚Äôd take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the ‚Äúbubble tournament‚Äù in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the ‚Äúbubble title,‚Äù or this one. Come on. Don‚Äôt be absurd.   I have no idea what‚Äôs going to happen here, and that‚Äôs great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday‚Äîthanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I‚Äôll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to get a read on where it‚Äôs going. Phoenix‚Äôs championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee‚Äôs championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs the exciting thing. There‚Äôs nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there‚Äôs none here. We truly don‚Äôt know for sure who‚Äôs going to win it, and that‚Äôs the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He‚Äôs really something else."
"It‚Äôs down to how different websites define what a possession is ‚Äî that‚Äôs why I couched it as **isn‚Äôt necessarily entirely true**. Pbpstats gives an explanation [here](https://dblackrun.github.io/2019/04/15/why-pbpstats-possession-counts-lower.html):  &gt; This season the NBA stats website started using exact possession counts instead of the estimate they had previously used. While exact counts had previously been available on some smaller sites, including my site, PBPStats, it was good to see what I would assume is the most visited site for NBA stats finally use exact counts. If you have compared numbers on the NBA site and on PBPStats you have probably noticed that the possession counts are different. How can the counts be different if both are using exact counts? Well it turns out defining a possession is not as simple as one might think. I will use game 1 of the Raptors Magic series to show a few examples of this.  &gt; At the end of the second quarter Danny Green makes a three with 0.4 seconds remaining. Orlando inbounds the ball to Aaron Gordon who fails to get a full court shot off before the buzzer sounds. Should this count as a possession for Orlando? Their percentage chances of scoring here are probably in the low single digits so does it make sense to count it the same as we would count a normal mid-quarter possession with a 24 second shot clock.  &gt; At the end of the third quarter Pascal Siakam misses a corner three. In the play-by-play Michael Carter-Williams is credit with a rebound with one second remaining in the quarter. Does that mean Orlando gets credited with a new possession after the rebound? As you can see from the video, it would take a miracle for them to score after the rebound.  &gt; At the end of the fourth quarter Kawhi Leonard missed a three pointer that would have tied the game and the ball went out of bounds with 0.5 seconds remaining. Orlando just needed to inbound the ball and have time expire to win the game. Should this be counted as a possession for them?  &gt; If you look at the stats for this game on the NBA site it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 99 possessions. On PBPStats it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 96 possessions. I don‚Äôt know exactly how possessions are counted on the NBA site, but the most logical guess I can make is the three possession difference is because the three examples above are all counted as possessions for Orlando. None of them are counted on PBPStats. Any possession that starts with two or fewer seconds remaining in a quarter isn‚Äôt counted as a possession, unless points are scored. I arbitrarily picked two seconds, but the goal was to limit counting end of quarter possessions with little to no chance of scoring.  &gt; This is why you will see the team efficiency stats 1-2 points per 100 possessions higher on PBPStats. This isn‚Äôt the only place where decisions need to be made on how to count a possession, flagrant fouls are another place (I count the free throws and possession following the free throws as two separate possessions), but it is the biggest one that would be causing most of the difference. I understand why one would count possessions the way they are on the NBA site - it‚Äôs easy to understand and easier to code, but I think not counting those end of quarter possessions give a better representation of a team‚Äôs efficiency. There is no perfect way to do it. Working with play-by-play data is always going to be messy and there will always be issues you hadn‚Äôt considered that come up. I think it‚Äôs good to have options available that make different choices and let the user decide which one makes more sense for what they are looking for."

"Kawhi's full legal name should be Kawhi ""When he's healthy"" Leonard"
"The suns were the second seed and the bucks were the third seed in the regular season.  The Lakers were the 7th seed because AD is made out of glass (he was injured most of the season) and LeBron was hurt.  The nets were missing one or 2 of their stars all season, why's it a shock that it also happened in the playoffs?  Kawhi gets hurt every other year in the playoffs especially since the Zaza thing.  The bucks missed Giannis for 2 games in the Hawks series and still closed us out.  The suns missed Chris Paul in the Lakers series where he literally played with one arm, and still knocked em out.  These were the two best teams. Did they have injury luck? Sure. But who didn't? The heat had injuries to Rondo, Pierce, and Danny Granger off the top of my head. The spurs saw injuries to steph, the warriors got injuries to westbrook, Chris Paul and Kawhi Leonard. The raptors had both Klay and Durant. Even last seasons heat saw a hurt giannis before the finals. Injuries are common in the NBA season and staying healthy is a part of the game."
Haven‚Äôt you heard CP3 leadership easily makes him more valuable than Kawhi Leonard and AD.
"Idk why but I still think a fully healthy Kawhi Leonard is the most important/best player in the playoffs, followed by KD, Giannis and Lebron with Luka on his way there if not already"
"Lol what. Yeah, every team should get Kawhi Leonard, Serge Ibaka, and Pascal Siakam, so easy."
Kawhi Leonard 2014. He‚Äôs 30 now and that was 7 years ago. Which would put him at 23.

"LeBron, Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Chris Paul, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  I don't think Dirk was even a top 10 player of the century. Some people might argue that Dirk was better than Wade and CP3, which is ok, but even if you have him over these two, there are still 10 other guys on that list."
"Draft picks, especially potentially high ones, are a real wildcard.  Tonnes of instances of teams making win-now trades where picks (or drafted players who were yet to play an NBA games) go the other way, and the picks become by far the best piece in the deal. Legendary examples that spring to mind:  - Kobe (13th overall) for Divac  - Dirk (9th overall) for Tractor Traylor  I tend to agree with you when someone is trading for a clearly elite player - Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, etc.  If you can deal for a player like that, you do it, pretty much regardless of the price.  But Simmons, while good, is also pretty flawed - this is more of a Boogie to the Pels type deal.  Just Hield and Bagley for Simmons would be a steal for the Kings, but throw in three 1sts and I think it‚Äôs a steal for the 76ers.  I‚Äôd say Hield, Bagley, an (unprotected) 1st and a 2nd is roughly even."

"Just no. Firstly, that's an article from 1975. Next, it's on dogs and rats with repaired/reconstructed ligaments.   Collagen isn't contractile so it can't get stronger in the respect, as it's a passive tissue.   Sure, it can be more robust in someone, but you can't gain strength. Also, ligaments are different than tendons in the sense of they have no muscle attachment. This is why they will usually reconstruct a high grade-2 ACL sprain.   Also, we are talking in the context of Kawhi Leonard, and a professional basketball player. There's no way for someone like that to strengthen ligaments. You can strengthen the surrounding muscles and improve stability of the joint. Also why if you have and ankle sprain, it's more likely to happen again, and keep happening. Also why braces exist, they are to support weaker ligaments that can't stabilize the joint anymore."
"Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry...hmmm..."
"i spaced and thought this thread was about kawhi leonard, my bad dude"
"I know word has ""leaked"" - AKA Kawhi's camp put it out - that Leonard was unhappy with the way the Clippers handled his injury, but the severity/time frame of recovery/age/injury history probably does more to ensure Kawhi stays in LA than anything else.   If we're being real, Kawhi's not exactly ever been a guy who is going to rush back from injury. With the shortened offseason, signing with a new team means that team won't get Kawhi back until well into next season, won't know what they are actually getting and the team would not be any sort of playoff threat next season."
"Yeah Dirk 2011 for sure before that he was already recognized as a great player but my main thought of him was the kind of soft big German guy who was a bit of a choker and had the worst exit for an MVP in the modern era, 2011 turned all that around         Just to throw another recent example in there I'll say Kawhi Leonard in 2020, this time it's the opposite his 2019 run with the Raptors had so many people calling him the best player in basketball and the way they struggled against Dallas and flamed out against Denver, all that was immediately lost like that"
Booty List how is kawhi leonard 2014 on here but not 2019
It was probably a smokescreen to keep the Suns guessing. Usually if you suffer a serious injury they report the player being out for the entire post season which didn't happen to kawhi. His status in each game was continuously updated from game to game. Even Chris Haynes reported that ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard is not ruling out a return at all during this postseason.‚Äù
"Kawhi Leonard has had problems with tendonitis in his right quad. He plays 39mins a game across 7 games, over 14 days. Five minutes to go in the fourth quarter of the 7th game he tears his ACL during a pretty innocuous bump that happens dozens of times a game.  The quads and hamstrings play a major part in protecting your knees in these types of situations. Any sort of weakness or fatigue can be a major factor in how your body handles these types of impacts. I wonder if this was one of those ""just a matter of time"" type of injuries."
"kawhi leonard, otherwise known as the originator of the dnp- rest"
"I'm not sure about ""open jumpshots"" in this scenario. The defensive platform against Lebron has always been to let him shoot. Sure, sometimes it doesnt work. This is Lebron James we're talking about.  Zone defense. AD gets the ball at the key. His man is Kawhi Leonard, or Pascal Siakam. Both have the length and defensive wherewithal to defend well against a jump shot. He puts the ball down to drive, he's doubled. He either passes out or puts up a contested jumper. That's a win in my books.  Gasol is absolutely fine in this scheme. At worst, the ball is passed to whoever ""has"" Gasol. And maybe you get an open jump shot for KCP or whichever other bum plays for the Lakers in this scenario.  The point is, you make Lebron and co. score. You try to take AD out of the game. The 2019 (into 2020) Raptors can do this. So can the Bucks. The warriors win on offense and defending lanes.  Take AD out of the game, make Lebron beat you. He ain't good enough in 2020 friend. It's not a ""mickey mouse ring,"" but there's certainly something to be said for the matchups he and the Lakers' faced in the bubble."

"Also, as much as Zaza can kick rocks from a professional standpoint, Kawhi's problems go beyond Zaza. From as much as I read -- given the mum nature from teams and the Kawhi camp -- he went from that FK ZAZA ankle sprain (after the earlier ankle sprain) to right quad tendinopathy to left patellar tendinopathy. And these cascading issues may have to do with altered mechanics when compensating from the preceding injury.  While I'm no doctor, but I still have concerns that his muscles have recovery issues that are abnormal when compared to his NBA peers. And that also makes me concerned he's going to retire sooner than his peers.  I sincerely hope my concerns are for naught.  P.S.: Fk that Nuggs fan, I hope his head gets booted into a volcano.  P.P.S.: Here are [two](https://quayhealth.com.au/kawhi-leonard-quadriceps-tendinopathy/) [reads](https://www.3cbperformance.com/blog/kawhi-leonard-knee-injuries-load-management) that helped me previously understand Kawhi's issue. Note that they are from November 2017 and December 2019, respectively. So obviously, he could be closer to or already has fully recovered. We're just not likely to know for sure."
"Kinda feels like LeBron has broken people‚Äôs brains when it comes to how *most* players look in their early 30s. Kawhi will be 31 the next time we likely see him play. Even if he *miraculously* looks exactly as good as he was at 29, the steep drop off for players with injuries or not can happen at really any moment. Think Dwyane Wade, and how quickly he got old. Carmelo went from averaging 22 ppg at 31 to 16 ppg at 33. Kawhi Leonard still being in his peak/prime/all-nba performance at 31-32-33 after all these injuries is unlikely‚Äîbut would be one helluva story."
1. Warriors - Steph Curry 2. Lakers - Lebron James  3. Clippers- Kawhi Leonard 4. Nets - James Harden 5. Nets -Kevin Durant 6. Sonics- Rashard Lewis 7. Bobcats- Sean May 8. Memphis- Hasheem Thabeet 9. Utah - Donovan Mitchell 10. Nuggets - Earl Boykins
"What‚Äôs tougher, a baby wipe or Kawhi Leonard?"
"Oh sorry that the Bucks lost Donte DiVincenzo, he totally compares to losing James Harden and Kyrie Irving. Look I'm not discrediting the Suns and Bucks, they beat who was in front of them but their injuries just don't even compare to them not having to face a healthy Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard. Those are all arguably top 10 players in the NBA with Lebron, Durant, Harden, Davis, and Leonard usually in people's top 5. They got breaks and the chances of it happening again are slim to none so i don't expect either team back next year."
Yeah it‚Äôs just cuz Nurse made adjustments. Stupid Casey has never heard of aDJUsTmeNts  Oh wait‚Ä¶..  And he had Kawhi  Leonard
This is the least shocking thing ever. When he was watching the games from the booth it was so fucking obvious his leg was probably wrapped in styrofoam from what was clearly a season ending injury.  Kawhi Leonard has broken both legs and his shooting hand. He is listed as questionable for tonight game.
Kawhi ‚ÄúVin Diesel‚Äù Leonard
"*10 months later*  ""Kawhi Leonard has made a 100% recovery but is seriously considering retirement to spend more time with his family."""
"Kawhi Leonard, thrash metal god."
"Kawhi Leonard and being vague about injuries, name a better duo  In all seriousness, I hope he gets well soon, basketball ain‚Äôt the same without that robotic fuck"
The caliber of player that has those demands taken seriously is way higher. Simmons isn‚Äôt James harden or kawhi Leonard. There‚Äôs not a guaranteed team that wants him in 4 years no matter how much of a douche he is on this contract like those guys
Poetl was apart of the Kawhi Leonard trade btw

"If trae kyrie harden are inj, then its open but yea i am exaggerating a bit. Point is luka shouldnt be getting ripped on for facing a kawhi leonard who missed 0 shots in the 4th in the 4 wins. It was too historic of a performance from kawhi but luka did make kawhi and pg dance a lot himself"
"It's like when you call a guy ""one of the best 2 way players in the league"". The Kawhi Leonard syndrome in like 2016/2017. Why cant I just be one of the ""best players in the league""."
Kawhi Leonard..
"Gross.  OG is the golden boy of the Raptors, and lowkey one of the best 3&amp;D players in the league. Masai refused to trade him for Kawhi Leonard. Why would the Raptors trade their least problematic player for one of the most problematic players in the league?"
"&gt;Weird without that ""lucky"" player you guys arent even in the playoffs  If by lucky player, you mean:  Kawhi Leonard Danny Green  Marc Gasol Serge Ibaka  Sure. And post-Leonard we were still one of the most successful teams in the East. Even went on our longest winning streak in team history. It's only after our team lost both centres that we went to seed.   &gt;When Demar Derozan is your ""franchise player"" you know your not a good franchise.   Pre-Leonard, the Raptors were a successful team in the East. Despite all the hate DeRozan is getting in this thread, he lead us to our first ECF. Something Embiid, so far, hasn't managed.  &gt;Upgrading from Derozan to arguably the best player in the league, ""risky"".  Lol. The revisionism is amazing. And didn't Morey pass on a perfectly healthy Harden for Simmons? Seems like it was more than just luck to pull that trigger on a superstar who hadn't played in a year, disgruntled and coming off major injury."
You need to make a cute and scary Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi sounds like kawaii and kowai.
"&gt; That‚Äôs just a bunch of excuses for MJ. You‚Äôre failing to look at the 93/94 team.  How so? It's the truth, they coasted to a title with Jordan and the very next year despite having better pieces overrall, couldn't make past the second round.  &gt; That team was a bad foul call away from the ECF. They took the Knicks to a game 5 without MJ. If they don‚Äôt make that BS call the Bulls are back in ECF. That‚Äôs not normal.  No they weren't, they were a bad foul call away from being up 3-2 in the series, the foul call didn't end the series, they had two games left to play and couldn't get it done.  &gt; You think the 2017 Cavs would make it to a game away from the ECF without Bron? Not a chance.  Yes, i absolutely do, especially considering how god awful the Eastern Conference was in 2017. They probably wouldn't have made the Finals, but they would've made the ECSF. They would've had to go through a 42-40 Pacers squad led by Wayoff P to match what the Bulls did in '94, hardly a challenge.  &gt; Or how about the 2011/12 Heat? Bron had to go nuclear in a game 6 at Boston down 3-2 in order to save their season. Bron doesn‚Äôt play that series and BOS probably sweeps Miami.  So? Jordan had to score 42 in Game 7 of the 1992 ECSF to carry the Bulls through the Knicks, then he had to average 41/8/6 in the greatest Finals performance of all time to beat the Suns in six, great players do great things.  &gt; I could do this exercise with a bunch of our modern stars and I can PROMISE you their teams aren‚Äôt winning 55 games without them.   And that only shows how you fail to understand what context is. Modern stars leave their teams because they don't think they can win, so they move while their teams rebuild, Michael didn't leave, he retired, the Bulls tried to bring new pieces to keep contending, which obviously didn't work as they got bounced in the second round.  But i will go along with it. Kevin Durant AND Serge Ibaka left the Thunder in 2016, they went from 55 to 47 wins. Kawhi Leonard left the Raptors and they went from 58 wins in 82 games to 53 in 72 the next year.  And since you love to ignore context, here is one that you will love: LeBron James joined a 35-win Lakers squad in 2018, they won 37 games with him the next year, by your logic you should question his impact."
Kawhi Leonard would become a top 5 borderline top 3 player in the league
Raptors winning a championship led by superstar Kawhi Leonard would be a surprising one
"Would be better if team B had one more interior defender, right now Duncan can't stop shaq and giannis together. Kawhi can't provide too much help on giannis cz he would be busy on James. Giannis would eat KD. Team A spacing would be horrible though, but to counterbalance it team B doesn't have any real curry stopper and would absolutely need to double him if they want to win.    Offensively Team B looks better but team A has way better defense : Shaq would protect the paint and can follow Duncan enough. Giannis is a relatively good matchup against KD and Leonard. MJ Kobe would be interesting and LeBron on Kd or Leo. Curry will be eat alive by Kyrie but it's the best option they have probably. They are also way better on switches so they would stop more team B than B would stop them.   I would go with team A."
"Luka's defense on Kawhi was mostly ok, rarely bad and good at times; Kawhi's defense on Luka was very rarely bad, a few times ok and mostly textbook great.  Luka imo notably dribbles ""safer"" here, meaning, he keeps the ball on his right hand behind his body a lot and lowers his shoulders early when driving against Leonard, which both slows his drives down a little bit, but keeps the opponents steal numbers low. Usually Luka has a higher dribble and keeps it more infront of his chest to dare his defender to go for a steal and make him look silly by using that exact moment to drive by and go to the basket. That just doesn't work against a fully engaged Kawhi."
Kawhi Leonard.
"I saw Kawhi Leonard in our female staffers‚Äô locker room at Staples yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him if I could use the bathroom really quick. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked outside and continued to wait, and I heard him chuckle as the door closed. When he came out after his pregame routine I saw him just standing in front of the door, not allowing anyone in. The security guard at the door was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, if you are done with the locker room, please allow access to the awaiting female staffers‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually moved out of the way. When she tried to open the door to let us in, he stopped her by putting his foot in the door‚Äôs path and told her the door is jammed because ‚Äúthe door hinges haven‚Äôt been lubricated in a while,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think door hinges need any lubrications. After she finally pushed his foot out of the way and opened the door, he kept telling her he now he has a sore foot and won‚Äôt be able to play that night and how it‚Äôs all her fault"
&gt;Sixers Rumors: Coach That **Helped** Kawhi Leonard Would 'Relish' Working With Simmons
Kawhi Leonard: Micheal Jordan skillset minus the heart.
Kawhi Leonard can do everything better than Lebron except passing....and being vocal of course
"Well Westbrook shoots 40% in the playoffs for his entire career so it‚Äôs not like him shooting 37% is abnormal, it‚Äôs actually quite a regular occurrence. And whatever excuse you wanna use, there is literally zero evidence that kawhi has ever done any better on kd than even a pj tucker. And I‚Äôd argue kd is an even better offensive player (especially in the playoffs) than he was back then and kawhi is a worse defensive player than he was at the time (quite inarguable at this point). That series against the Spurs was one of KDs most efficient series that post season. Why wasn‚Äôt the DPOY gaurding the best player that plays the same position as him? Why would he apply his efforts to make an already wildly inefficient player slightly more inefficient? And the argument wasn‚Äôt was OKC better than the spurs (obviously they were that‚Äôs why they won) you said he had kds number, which like I said, there is zero evidence for. Then I preceded to bring up their previous matchup in which Kevin Durant out dueled him individually by a wide margin. They haven‚Äôt even really played each other much, what do you want me to do, bring up a game that never happened? I brought up literal statistical evidence and all you did was call me a dummy. I like kawhi leonard I just don‚Äôt know exactly where you‚Äôre point can be proven here. I know that you BELIEVE that you‚Äôre right though so I guess hey A for effort."
"Nah, Lakers history is too rich, and if the Kawhi Leonard era with the Clippers ends with NO rings, not a chance"
Dont forget Kawhi Leonard.
Kawhi Carter.  Imagine if Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard could also jump like a young Vince Carter.   Or imagine young Vince Carter also being arguably the best defender in the NBA.
"#Jeremy Lin  Steph Curry, Kyle Lowry, Monte Ellis, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Amar'e Stoudemire, David Lee, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol are the biggest names I could think of. I think I got them all.   I'll go with Curry, Kobe, Kawhi, Melo, Gasol"
"Yeah, I got you. Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs getting me. Raptors draft these guys and fans say they‚Äôre always the next Kawhi. OG Anunoby was/is supposed to be the next Kawhi. Scottie Barnes is supposed to be the next Kawhi. It seems like a cop out to suggest any NBA prospect with length and an unpolished offensive game is going to be Kawhi Leonard.  Before the draft analysts suggested if all went well for Kuminga he could have a game similar to Jaylen Brown and if they don‚Äôt go super well, Al Farouq Aminu. That tracks for me. Nothing in his game says Kawhi Leonard and no one was making that comparison until GSW drafted him."
Nikola Jokic √ó David Robinson    The Offensive Maestro becomes an Elite Defensive Anchor with insane athleticism and endurance. Jokic plays both ends of the court now at triple the speed and never ends the game gassed.  Kawhi Leonard √ó Scottie Pippen   The Claw becomes an extremely smooth athlete and a better playmaker shoring up some of the only real knocks on his game. He'd also have even more physical tools to work with on the defensive end and presumably is freed from his knee issues.  Steph Curry √ó Vince Carter   The Worlds Greatest Shooter now has size and ridiculous leaping added to his elite conditioning. Imagine him running through the defense as an absolute lob threat as well; you could never take your eyes off him for even a split second inside or outside the arc with or without the ball as an oposing player or a fan.
"Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15OA with the expectation that he would be a good 3+D in the NBA. Certainly no one expected him to be a top-5 NBA player but everyone expected him to be a defensive stalwart, especially once San Antonio drafted him.  Anyway, that's all to say that I absolutely agree with you on these things being teachable but that's why I'm suggesting it's a lazy comparison. He's got the size of Kawhi and is probably more athletic, but not much else is remotely comparable.  Any one of these prospects could flip a switch and develop BBIQ and defensive acumen. Will they? Likely not. But maybe they will. Even so, I'm not sitting here saying Jalen Johnson or Tre Mann or whoever else is going to be Kawhi Leonard because they have similar height.  I'm sure Kuminga will be a good to great talent. But I feel like the Kawhi comparisons are just sports writers pandering to GSW fans for off-season clicks."
"To be fair Kuminga is only 18, and I went to SDSU as the same time as Kawhi Leonard and even the biggest Aztec homers never thought he would be what he is now. Kawhi was an elite rebounder and good defensive player at SDSU but he really didn't blow you away offensively. We were just hyped that someone from our school got drafted but never expected him to be anything more than an NBA role player.   I'm not saying Kuminga is going to be Kawhi, but I am saying no one thought Kawhi was going to be the player that he is now. It's hard to tell what these guys are going to develop into when they are so young and BBIQ and shot selection are teachable things. Dude is only 18."
"Kuminga seems like he has a good head on his shoulders and is a hard worker who will be a good basketball player. But the Kawhi Leonard comparisons are lazy and off the mark.   Kuminga is a great athlete with great size and he'll crush it in transition and off the cut. But his issue is BBIQ and consistency. His shot selection is horrible, especially in the mid-post, more than a handful of times I watched him try to go 1v3 in transition, great vision but has lots of loose passes and turnovers. These are issues that many young players have. But if you watched him last year, his defense wasn't good. He was a wild card from possession to possession in the G and you saw lots of lazy reaching, lunging and walking. He couldn't work around screens, and was often caught watching when he was off-ball. He has all the tools to be a great NBA player but will require GSW to really work on his defense, shot, and decision-making.  Kawhi Leonard came into the league noted for his defensive acumen and has since earned seven All-Defensive Team selections and won DPOY twice. To this point, nothing in Kuminga's game has shown that he will ever reach that level of NBA defense."

"Kawhi Leonard &amp; Tim Duncan.    Every other star in the NBA is allowed to be surrounded by stars like Shaq, Kobe, Wade, Lebron, Harden, Pippen, Curry, Durant, Davis, Westbrook etc. but when Kawhi and TD play with dudes on the verge of retirement well past their primes (Robinson) or not even a superstar (Lowry, or the big 3 in SA), they get discredited.   Kawhi has only shared his prime with another star twice in his career, PG, last year during the pandemic and this season where he was on his way to another championship.  Duncan because he too never really shared his prime with another star, D-Rob was old, he shared it somewhat with Manu, and TP took like a decade to hit his prime."
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"

A young Kawhi Leonard or KD
"Yea he‚Äôs completely wrong here. Brian Wright took over for RC Buford as GM a few years ago. Pop is the President of Basketball Operations and has also repeatedly stated he doesn‚Äôt involve himself in the draft process and primarily focuses only on coaching. If it was up to Pop, the Spurs would have never taken a chance on Manu (RC Buford), Tony (Sam Presti), or traded Pops favorite player George Hill for Kawhi Leonard on draft day. He‚Äôs great at fostering talent, just not so much at initially judging it."
"nah man, Murray isn‚Äôt even efficient as the secondary player. why would he get more efficient as lead ball handler? something he hasn‚Äôt done since he played for Canada?    Look at their non-bubble stats and it‚Äôs kinda clear:  2019-20 tracking stats:          Catch and Shoot.      Pull-up     Murray     39% 2.33PA     32% 3.03PA     Sexton     42% 2.23PA     35% 1.73PA  Sexton is the better shooter already, Murray getting worse looks and more attention isn‚Äôt going to increase his efficiency at all  yeah Murray might go up to 24 a game (something Brandon Ingram didn‚Äôt even do) but i find it hard to believe anybody thinks Murray could do that while increasing how often he makes shots. he would easily be the worst 24 point scorer in the league.   for reference: Kawhi Leonard averaged 24.8,Trae Young averaged 25.3, and Sexton 24.3. you‚Äôre asking for a huge leap from Murray off an injury when his career high is 21.2 in a bubble year"
I think he got Meyers Leonard and Kawhi Leonard mixed up
yeah‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt imagine how the clippers won a playoff series without *checks notes* all nba player kawhi leonard
"It's hard to pick one specific team but not hard to see any one of these teams dropping off.    * Lakers: Could easily miss the playoffs and almost did last season. They're reliant on the health of their stars, who have all had questionable health lately.  * Clippers: Are missing Kawhi Leonard for the season. They'll be a team with one mid-level all-star and that's not a playoff lock in either conference.  * Warriors: Just missed the playoffs due to injuries and their return to the playoffs is largely dependant on a return to form from Klay or one of their young guys stepping up.  * Mavericks: Hyper Doncic-reliant at the moment and haven't really done anything to change that. They're a 5-10 seed depending on how good of a season Luka has.   * Blazers: Depends on what happens with Dame. Plus they've carried a ton of injuries lately.   * Jazz/Suns/Nuggets: I would say they're probably the safest 3 teams, even if they're not necessarily the best 3 teams."
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they‚Äôve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn‚Äôt an executive in the league that matches Masai‚Äôs overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
What‚Äôs going on with kawhi Leonard. I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop.
Very close between them all personally but I think Jokic &gt; kawhi rn for a few reasons.  Kawhis declining defensive play(cannot play both ends at full effort anymore even in the playoffs) means he's now more of a scorer than a 2 way force  Jokic better is almost everything offensively other than off dribble scoring based on past season where Jokic took on a scoring load(Leonard better in playoffs this year despite finishing in a lower seed due to both the Mavs and jazz having no player who can defend him).  Jokic can run a top 3 offense all time when his squad is fit and is a superior floor raiser.  Despite these it's still debateable but then kawhi got an acl injury and I think Jokic is well clear now.   Harden is probably better.
"Don't trade Danny Granger in 2014. Even though he was washed, that trade was the final blow to destroy the team's chemistry. We might still lose to Miami that year, but I think we avoid limping to the playoffs barely above .500 and get taken to 7 games by Pero Antic in round 1 if that trade never happens.  I was tempted to say the Kawhi Leonard draft day trade instead, but there's a chance he doesn't develop if not for starting out in SA. If there's a certainty in this hypothetical that he develops the same, then I'd go with that instead."
Kawhi Leonard and Nikola Vucevic  are up there for sure
Kawhi Leonard
"They have prolly most uninspiring big 3 in terms of big name talent but I kind of see this working contigent on The Paw being the defensive anchor.Lavine would be the first option Derozan second and Vucevic the third imo.I may very well be overrating Williams but I kind of feel he will decide the future for the team, I kind of feeling he has a ceiling of all nba player and if he achieves that they could compete eventually for a chip.For next season,If the team manages to develop Paw well enough(ie Kawhi leonard spurs formative year kind of season) they will finish the 4th seed imo with 2nd round exit being the playoff best outcome"

"&gt;Like, if he moves the team to Seattle, who's really gonna be mad at him?  Kawhi Leonard."
"He was probably in a lot of pain too considering he'd been playing on a bum knee since the Milwaukee series.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2019/08/07/kawhi-leonard-seen-sporting-knee-wrap-months-after-nba-finals-photo/amp/  He might've been dealing with tendinitis, he wasn't fully healthy months later."

"Maybe it was his shoulder, but last year playing alongside Lowry, he was eh.  In 2019 playing alongside Lowry and Kawhi Leonard (top 5 player imo), he looked amazing.  He may be amazing on the warriors cause he‚Äôll be that 3rd option behind Steph and Klay, but it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs an effective 1st or 2nd option.  All that being said, Siakam is great but at what price? Does he move the needle for the warriors based on what Toronto wants back for him‚Ä¶don‚Äôt think so"
"You're crazy if you think [this](https://i.imgur.com/VeSB00w.png) is a bad contract for an elite two way player. Using your ""injury prone player on the wrong side of 30"" argument, what makes Anthony Davis a worse contract than [Kawhi Leonard?](https://i.imgur.com/B9aKYAt.png) He's older, more injury concerns and more money. I think both are good contracts, but if you think that way about AD, then surely you'd have to think Kawhi's is worse, right?  Also, as far as AD's injury concerns, this past year was the first time in five years that he had a major injury. The fact that it came after the shortest off-season ever, and in a year where normal training was impeded by Covid (which is why so many other stars got hurt) should alleviate all this hand wringing about AD's health."

"I used to truly believe this. Then I actually went and looked at his career, accomplishments, etc. His level of play was just so beyond anyone else‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I now have trouble arguing against him as the GOAT. I agree that the 90s maybe saw a slight downturn in talent level, and LeBron probably is more well rounded, and the media did push Jordan‚Äôs narrative but I mean‚Ä¶. Imagine Steph curry level offense and efficiency plus prime Kawhi Leonard level defense PLUS LeBron level leaping ability and speed. That appears to be what MJ was. I will admit that I never saw him play and I used to be a part of the MJ hate circlejerk, and I do still hate him, but his legacy is indisputable. He was incredible."
"Where's your facts though? You're basing it off what you want to be true. Not what's been said about him in the league nor is it in his personality.   [So here we have the most well respected coach saying he wasn't a leader.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2807790-kawhi-leonard-responds-to-gregg-popovich-saying-he-wasnt-a-leader-with-spurs#:~:text=%22Kawhi%20was%20a%20great%20player,may%20come%20as%20he%20progresses.)   So to establish that he's changed and matured, you basically need players to come forward to say that he was the soul of the team and his leadership carried them through tough stretches. I don't remember reading anything alluding to that.   Like I said, he leads by example, he'll put his head down and work his ass off. That's a different sorta leadership in my opinion. When you say someone is the soul of the team, that's the voice in the locker room that cuts through the noise and keeps ppl focused. LBJ is a leader, CP3 is a leader, Butler's a leader - do you see Kawhi doing what these guys do?   I'm not discrediting Kawhi at all. I give full credit to what he does, it's a fact we don't win a championship without him. He carried us when the team when we needed it, but his voice wasn't what was galvanizing us during the title run- it was Lowry and Serge. But if you're going to say he was the soul of the team, then you're really really wrong."
"For anyone saying ""That's what was said to Demar"" they got KAWHI LEONARD out of it.  You wouldn't do it?  If the same rare window like that opens again, then yes, I'd hope they ship Siakam + extra pieces out for said player"
Kawhi Leonard
like how Kawhi Leonard became available.
Definitely Kawhi Leonard
It‚Äôs not ridiculous whatsoever   &gt;is Kawhi Leonard even a top 5 scorer in the league right now  He‚Äôs unquestionably a top 5 scorer.
it was sarcasm my friend   but it is ridiculous to say that kawhi is as good offensively as durant.  never has been and never will be.  KD is a top 5 scorer ever.   is kawhi leonard even a top 5 scorer in the league right now?
2022: Kawhi Leonard forces his way to Utah.
"Kawhi Leonard, a consensus top 5 player (and #1 to some), joined a team with another top 15 player and a stacked supporting cast. Not hard to understand the hype."
"I love the kid but Og Anunoby.  I don't think he'll be as good offensively as people think he will. I do think he'll be a borderline all star some day, but he won't have that Kawhi Leonard break out like people want to believe."
"I honestly feel PG &gt; Kawhi Leonard. I could be wrong. And I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm definitely right, but for all the over excessive hate PG gets by  trend following nephews, he seems to really get going and make tough shots when needed. He also has a presence. Not necessarily who I‚Äôd call an amazing leader by any means but he seems to just do a bit more than Leonard, who just plays. And then has no impact on other players from what we see."
Why do people think a 34 year old Lebron James who has been injured in the last 2 of the 3 seasons is better than Kawhi Leonard + PG + keeping our young core who could have been flipped later?
"CP3, Magette, Danny Manning, Blake, DeAndre, Redick, Elton Brand, Jamal Crawford, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard is 10 alone  Then you have Bob Mcadoo, Randy Smith, Chris Kaman, Ron Harper, Bob Kauffman, Norm Nixon, Lamar Odom, World B Free, Quentin Richardson, Loy Vaught, Ken Norman, and many more probably   Also keep in mind that Beverly only played for the clips for 4 seasons and only average double digits once. Good defender for sure, but that alone puts so many other players ahead of him. For example you say Lamar Odom doesn't count but he was on the Clippers for the same amount of time as Beverly while having way more of an impact"
Hmmm tepid: Kawhi Leonard is overrated as a winning player and people won‚Äôt remember him much in 20 years.   Warm: Booker will never win a ring as the best player on a team   Hot: The Hawks‚Äô run was a flash in the pan and won‚Äôt result in prolonged playoff success  Spicy: monk will wind up with a better NBA career than his Kentucky teammates (fox and bam)
"Is that major SF named Kevin Durant, lebron James, or kawhi Leonard????"
"Kawhi Leonard &gt; Larry Bird, and Klaw‚Äôs a top 5 SF of all time too. @ me"
"""Yeah it's not even a conversation that 2x MVP and 1x Final MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo could be considered better than Kawhi Leonard.  Oh also Giannis is the second player of all time to get MVP and DPOY in the same year.  But yeah no Kawhi sons him he's so much better""  - your head ass"
"Kawhi did not play as well in 2020. People just ignored it cause lolclippers, but i can see boston or the heat beating toronto with Leonard in 2020"
"Kawhi Leonard.  Sure, hes had a couple of legendary runs, but who is going to remember him besides Raptor fans?  On the Spurs, he wasn't the main guy and I doubt he's gonna see a lot of success on the Clippers.  He also doesn't play enough to get the counting stats."
"Pretty sure it happened but kawhi Leonard probably said in his monotone voice ‚Äúit‚Äôs apple time‚Äù. In the video, neagreanu made Leonard look like an idiot lol. That‚Äôs probably why Kawhi denied it."
Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard. I have a sneaking suspicion he‚Äôs good.
Imagine that level of offensive dominance plus prime Kawhi Leonard level defense. That was MJ *every* season
This was one of the better individual defensive games Ive seen a perimeter player have with what Kawhi Leonard did. It was the first round nobody cares and they lost but one of the best two way performances youll see of the past 5 yrs. +18 in a game they lost by 2 pts lol
"How is that lucky? Because Terrance Mann is not Kawhi? I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm not understanding your question, but I think you answered it yourself. Terrance Mann put up a stat line Kawhi Leonard would love to have in a series clenching game at home, while coming off a red hot season where he averaged 7-points a game.   That discrepancy between 7ppg in the regular season and 39 points in a playoff game is the largest ppg differential in the history of the NBA. His performance was, literally, the most unlikely thing to happen. It has never happened ever. It was truly special because of how rare it was.   Look on any roster for a guy who scores 7ppg and then say, ‚Äúwould I be surprised if this person lead a 20+ point comeback en route to scoring his career high in the NBA (or college too in the case of Mann) at 39 points?‚Äù Of course you would be surprised. It‚Äôs only happened once ever. And his name was Terrance Mann."
"Kawhi Leonard. His career numbers will be low enough due to injuries that he won‚Äôt rank highly in any particular career metrics. He has two rings but people won‚Äôt see him in the career points, rebounds, etc. totals so he will easily be forgotten 10 yes after his career is done.   Kyrie too if he retires early or ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù from the public eye."
I had a rule to never draft spurs players. For the reason you mentioned and that everyone (except for Kawhi Leonard) knows that we will rest our guys throughout the season.    Broke the rule last year tho with Keldon.
"The problem with Fultz is that it is hard to not write off someone that was injured coming into the league and has been injured almost every year of his career so far, dude has came into the league in 2017 and has played 113 games, Kawhi Leonard of all people has played 109 games since 2019 with the Clippers.  The other elephant in the room is his 26% 3-PT percentage, i'm sure the kid has talent (otherwise he wouldn't have been the consensus No.1 pick in a draft with Tatum, Fox and Mitchell), but injuries really didn't even let him start and show his strengths."
"the disrespect on tim duncan is massive.  some nba hofers still consider kobe &gt; lebron, and duncan was always compared to kobe bryant in his era.  no one else in terms of GOAT (maybe garnett?  but that's a cap)  anything stat related about tim duncan has no relevance due to the spurs minutes restrictions.   unless it pertains to winning.  duncan is a winner and people need to recognize and acknowledge the win shares,  career win%, playoff wins, and championships.  duncan and bryant were regularly compared and they were closely together.    manu and tony had small stretches of being primary options ahead of duncan in some of their championships, but they don't win without duncan up until their 5th championship.  you could argue the 5th one was a team effort + kawhi leonard/duncan/danny green's defense.   tim duncan + bill russel are regularly disrespected. duncan is top 15 all time no question."
"Are people really being honest with their answers?  Saying names like Michael Carter Williams/Tyreke Evans/Jabari Parker and whatever is at the top of the page when you Sort By Best?  Like who do people consider as top 5 players right now?  Players like Giannis?  Anthony Davis?  Kawhi Leonard?   The names that people are listing, do people really think were going to reach that level?   Top 5 is Finals MVP level.  You look at a guy like Jimmy Butler, who was the best player in a NBA Finals team, I doubt majority of the people consider him top 5 level.  Or even the Suns teams this past Finals.  Do people consider anybody in Suns a top 5 player?  Top 5 is a ridiculous high level to reach."

Their streak ended because they had to trade Kawhi Leonard for freaking DeMar DeRozan lmao
"now he is Liquid Popcelot, forever dedicated to battling the legacy of rogue AIs like Kawhi Leonard (KL)"
Paul George will play like a top 10 player in the regular season with the absence of Kawhi Leonard.
"Mavs are a lot closer to a championship than people think. Just got unlucky enough to matchup against the clippers in the first round 2 years in a row. Even last year, we had so many chances to win the series, taking the clippers with Kawhi Leonard to 7 games. And then that same team without Kawhi makes it to the WCF and takes 2 games. This year, porzingis has his first healthy offseason in forever, new coach helps him play and fit better, and the mavs make the WCF"
Kawhi Leonard. Dude has prob been the best player in the league for 4 years now ever since the season he got hurt by Zaza I think he‚Äôs been the best player in the league. This man gets 0 credit for turning it up soooo hard every playoffs. Never in the discussion for best player in the league and all he does is win. Can‚Äôt stand the narrative around him.
When the Raptors lost Kawhi Leonard we still played just as well

"1. LeBron James 2. Michael Jordan 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Larry Bird 5. Hakeem Olajuwon  Center is the hardest position since you want a high iq passer in the lineup. I thought about Garnett, but Shaq was his kryptonite.  I think the shooting on this team is good enough to be close enough to yours and the defense is quite a lot better."
Yeah he was awesome I also watched Kawhi Leonard play defense he was awesomer
Kawhi Leonard was better by any era adjusting you want to use and your right Kawhi actually would‚Äôve been better suited for late 2000s basketball than just about anybody. Only thing Melo did better than Kawhi was create a brand and image he had lots of fans stan for. Melo gave New York one season of being a top 10 arguably even top 15 player and you still see all these Knicks fans stan for him not because he was that amazing but because of the image and appeal he created. Melo jab stepping in place and hitting 3 out of every 8 pull up 18 footers just seemed cooler than when anybody else did it even if Kawhi is clearly better at it
"You can't convince me Michael Kidd-Gilchrist doesn't at least develop into an ok offensive player and make All-Defensive teams if he was drafted by San Antonio or something instead of Charlotte.   People are forgetting that as prospects, MKG was supposed to be the new and improved version of what Kawhi Leonard had been drafted as the previous year... both considered great (potentially elite) defender right out of the gates, with enough tools to be competent offensively.  One got drafted to a fantastic situation, one was drafted to a bottom feeder organization in the league who had been doing the revolving door with coaches, and finally settled on one who couldn't care less about player development and stagnated his development from age 20 to 24."
"Yes to Kawhi Leonard. No to Vince Carter.  I mean, considering how much shit the latter has thrown at the franchise since the day he traded Toronto for Brooklyn (without even getting the team to a single NBA Final, mind), they might as well comply and keep that hatchet sharp. It's not even his feud with Sam Mitchell, but him flinging crap at everything Raptors-related for the better part of a decade and change, from the fans to the parking lot. Let's honor him by telling him to piss off.  The team should have kept McGrady and shipped Carter off, really."
"kawhi leonard, when healthy never seen him out of shape or anything"
Moody has a choppa on him fr and Kuminga is gonna be Kawhi Leonard with good knees in 3 years lolz
"To be a key rotation player at 20/21 on a real championship contender, you have to be pretty damn good no? The last guy to do that was Kawhi Leonard right?"
You understand that being a valued role player on a championship contender at 20yo is very rare and very impressive right?   Go through the list of Championship finalistsand find me the guys who were in the rotation at 20/21.   The only ones I can think of off the top of my head are Kawhi Leonard and Andrew Bynum.
"""What vaccination?"" - Kawhi Leonard"
&gt;there's no decision on whether Kawhi Leonard will play this season.  lmao wanna bet?
Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard
"Assist numbers are just part of the story.  The bulls relied more on pippen than Jordan to facilitate. Jordan didn‚Äôt run the point, his role was a lot more similar to kawhi Leonard, for example.   Watch a Jordan playoff game and then watch lebron run the offense in 2016-2018. You‚Äôll see the obvious difference."
"Dragged poorly constructed teams twice to 7 games against maybe the best wing rotations in the league.  Like seriously the guy has no legit second option his 7‚Äô1 Center can‚Äôt post up on mismatches and he was being guarded by Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Marcus Morris, and Nic Batum, and Patrick Beverly for both his playoff appearances and still lit them up.  He‚Äôs a top 5 player."
"Conley has been injury-prone for years. It's not an excuse anymore, it should be expected. And why do you conveniently leave out losing the 2nd (3rd if we count Giannis now) best player in the playoffs in Kawhi Leonard?"
- Lebron  - Kobe  - Duncan  - KG  - Dirk  - Nash  - Durant  - Steph  - Chris Paul  - Allen Iverson  - Paul Pierce  - James Harden  - Kawhi Leonard  - Giannis Antetkounmpo  - Dwyane Wade  - Jason Kidd
Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi Leonard shouldn't be on this list. His rehab will be all year, and he doesn't rush rehab because he doesn't really like basketball. You can tell he's one of the players that recognizes that it's his only claim to wealth and it's obvious that he can lift his entire family up for generations, but that's the only reason he plays, and given an out like this he's gone for as long as he can get paid. He has absolutely no passion. Look at Steph Curry. Leading the league in scoring on a non playoff team just because that kid is a gym rat from birth."
Kawhi Leonard actually is a robot.
"2 players/scenarios popped into my head:  1- If Kawhi wasn‚Äôt quiet. Not even if he was an asshole, but if he talked the amount a normal player did. He‚Äôd be disliked for how he left SA, disliked/mocked for leaving Toronto after a chip just to go fail in LA. And the few anecdotes we see among teammates we have the Rondo situation where it seems he tried to throw rondo under the bus for his missed shot, getting rid of Lou and Harrell, and (lol) I forget who but somebody had a turnover and Kawhi calmly says ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt give it up you to to do that shit‚Äô lmao    2. Ron Artest. *This doesn‚Äôt fit the three criteria as a parallel*. But yea. People know he was all time defensively, but I dont think people realize he turned a corner *offensively*.   The 7 games before the malice, on a team with prime Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal, a team that was probably best in the league, he was averaging 25,6, and 3 on 50-40-90 splits. Only 7 games, but it‚Äôs safe to say he had arrived physically and mentality (ironic). That was his age 25 season, 2nd in Indy, away from a very young immature Bulls team. He was on his way to essentially becoming‚Ä¶Kawhi Leonard. He doesn‚Äôt exactly fit the criteria bc he only became ‚Äúhated‚Äù"
"He hasn't won anything yet cause he's busy trying to beat paul george and kawhi leonard with his number 2 being a 7' 3"" bench shooter who gets like 4 rebounds a game. Luka has the ability and skillset to be the best on a championship team, AD just isn't built like that"
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"

"It's possible but I don't see it happening at this point, it's crazy how much we've been blue balled by this battle , the Clippers have that huge collapse in the bubble , and then the Clippers duck the Lakers in the seeding but then the Lakers get eliminated in the first round anyways if it happens this year with Kawhi Leonard being out for much of the year maybe Paul George carries the Clippers to a six or seven seed and I'm sure the Lakers finished top three but there's no juice if it happens that way especially if Kawhi Leonard just doesn't play at all"
"You skipped right over the real mistake‚Äî kawhi was going to leave no matter what, but they shouldn‚Äôt have traded for Derozan.  And I love Derozan, but if you‚Äôre trading Kawhi freaking Leonard, you need multiple legit high upside, already rock solid young players. You need Jaylen Brown and lots of picks. You need Ben Simmons. You can‚Äôt just settle for demar Derozan."

"I like your trade. But no way Morey does. Can Simmions just retire to get no fine? Is the fine less than pay? If money comes out of pocket no way Simmions doesnt show up.  I only know McDaniels cause SDSU fan and his brother and family had connections. Was going to be highest ranked recuit ever for us SDSU. Kawhi Leonard was ranked lower.  What about warriors giving wiggins, one of this years 1st round picks and 2 future first. U like Wolves or warriors offer more?"
You didn‚Äôt use numbers the year before they joined the Hawks. You said Capela averaged 16 and went to 15and he averaged 13 and increased his scoring with the Hawks. You chose incorrect stats on purpose.   Kemba missed 16 games in the regular season and 0 in the post-season. He was banged up not injured. Otherwise Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry won an NBA championship more injured than Kemba last year.  And again you said they have 7 plus guys that could do that. Where only 4 of his teammates have ever done that with one of them being 34 and out of his prime.   What‚Äôs also funny is that 2 of the players you reference were playing with generational playmakers with Harden and CP3.   And it‚Äôs hilarious that you keep saying ‚Äúppg last year before hawks‚Äù when that isn‚Äôt true.

"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs single digit percentage at all. You won‚Äôt always get the same caliber of a player but I‚Äôm pretty sure I can name one or two star players that were available on the market for the last 5. Last year, Harden and Vucevic became available. The year before D‚Äôangelo Russell became available. The year before that Kawhi Leonard, Kristaps Porzingis, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris became available. Year before that it was an all-star level Blake Griffin. You see where I‚Äôm going with this? Literally every player I just named when added to this roster would keep them contending at a high level if they received them at the level they played at the time to today (other than maybe Vucevic since he plays the same position as Embiid). These happen far more often than you think and in recent times, rather than being a single digit percent chance of happening on a season by season basis, over the last 5 years it has happened 100% of the time."
"Kawhi Leonard  Also, celtics messed up but had chemistry issues. They beat Philly like 2- 3 times that year I think"

"It was a massive shot but are we also saying Bosh won them the series because he got the rebound and passed it to Allen? Saying Allen won the series for the Heat means he is the primary reason they won. Clearly he wasn't, at best he was the #4 player on that team. LeBron won that championship by putting up 25-11-7 while being defended by Kawhi Leonard. Before making that shot Ray Allen had 2 points for the game, LeBron had 12 in the 4th."
Tony Parker  George Gervin  Kawhi Leonard  Tim Duncan  David Robinson  6th man Manu Ginobili.
"What kinda squad do you think it would take to beat this team? This is what I‚Äôd choose.       PG Kobe Bryant     SG Michael Jordan     SF Kawhi Leonard     PF Lebron James     C Joel Embiid      Allow me to explain. I think that Kobe and Jordan would be a defensive terror in their primes. Kobe was picking up guards full court when he played with Shaq and he was also given point guard duties and did a good job. Having Kobe committed to running the point while also being able to chase Steph would be fun. And Steph wouldn‚Äôt be able to guard Kobe. Jordan and Kawhi could probably both switch back and forth from Klay and KD. Lebron can hang with Giannis. And though I understand Embiid is no Shaq, he‚Äôs still really skilled, has size, and also the right type of attitude to go against Shaq. He won‚Äôt wanna get punked."
"nah they would not be absolute favorites.   Assuming EVERYONE's healthy? Then I think the Lakers take that, with the Clippers with Leonard coming back healthy close behind, the Bucks third.  Assuming realistic situations? the Lakers will depend on LeBron/AD being healthy, Nuggets on Murray's health, Clippers on how fast Kawhi returns / how he looks after the return.   Don't forget that KD hasn't always been injury-free, and Harden seemingly also has injury issues as of late (although he has been injury-free for most of his career) - so it's not like the Nets have superior expectations when it comes to being injury free."
Ask Kawhi Leonard.
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Are you genuinely asking him to explain why Kawhi Leonard at his best is in a different tier than Klay
"Probably the second best team in the West especially considering Kawhi Leonard probably isn't going to play for the Clippers next season, but outside of any unfortunate injuries I see them losing in the Conference Finals to the Lakers"
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
Kawhi Leonard needs some kind of mention in this thread.
"Not including Kawhi Leonard in the top3, not even as a 'honorable mention', for the best defender in the league does not sound right. He still wreaks havoc on opposing perimeter players, especially during playoffs"
"DeMar (4-time consecutive all-star if I recall correctly), Jakob (young promising prospect), and a late first round pick was considered a slight underpay for one year of Kawhi Leonard.  Morey allegedly asked our team for Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, a Kyle Lowry S&amp;T, AND the 4th-overall pick.  Morey set his asking price too high, and the rest of the NBA moved on without pursuing Simmons."
"He still did played a major part on their defense which led for the game to last 7 games, but he was indeed shooting less but for someone who‚Äôs age was 36 with .554% ts% was still pretty impressive, but then again if it were not for Kawhi Leonard Danny Green playing significantly better during the finals it could‚Äôve been lasted only 5 or 6 games. The Miami heat was truly strong."
"Per 538 after game 3  &gt;Sunday‚Äôs matchup data paints a jarring illustration of just how successful Leonard was in limiting Antetokounmpo. The Bucks star was effective enough, shooting 4 of 7 for 10 points, when being defended by someone other than Leonard, according to the ESPN Stats &amp; Information Group. But when Kawhi took on the unenviable task, Antetokounmpo shot just 1 of 9 (11 percent) for 2 points ‚Äî his worst showing against a single defender over the past three postseasons.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhis-defense-kept-the-raptors-season-alive/"
And r/Lakers fans called him Kevin Durant combined with Kawhi Leonard. So maybe both sides were off

"My selection has exceeded his draft expectations. When on the court, he's a smart player who makes wise decision. Is far from ""straight up trash."" And has never gotten into legal trouble that I know of. But...he's just slimy.  Yes, I am referring to Kawhi Leonard. People have so much hate for the LeBrons and KDs of the world. What about Kawhi? He quit on the Spurs. Just flat out said he was never going to play for them again. The Spurs were a dynasty. Dare I be bold, but the Cavs and Thunder weren't dynasties. Then Kawhi strung Toronto along when he knew he had no intention of ever resigning with them. Leonard finally got to LA - and the same problems are following him. Diva behavior. His infamous uncle. Wants his own training staff. Won't join his teammates on the bench. Etc., etc. But, somehow, Leonard gets passes that no other player near his caliber would get. Just all reminds me of a shady car salesman. None of this is to take away from Kawhi's talent, because when he wants to play, he's a beast."
Kawhi Leonard.
"You gotta split LeBron‚Äôs career in 2 main pieces:   ‚Ä¢Spurs (Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard) Tim Duncan caused the most damage offensively, so I would consider Tim Duncan to be his greatest rival from 07-14.  ‚Ä¢Warriors (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala) Stephen Curry has played longer than KD on the warriors and has had a leader role for almost his  whole career, thats why I believe Stephen Curry is LeBron‚Äôs greatest rival from 2015 to now."
"Also applies for Kawhi ""load management"" Leonard?"
"Maybe Dan Marino and Reggie Miller. Both very respected, but just played in eras before the real value of how to best utilize their skillset was realized.   Adrian Peterson and Russell Westbrook. Work ethic, extreme physicality, great teammates, MVP seasons around a rare statistical feat (2000 yard season, triple-double season). AP's catching out of the backfield = Westbrook's jumpshooting.  Josh Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi's jumpshooting = Allen's accuracy. Once both figured those out, they were superduperstars.  Aaron Rodgers and Kevin Durant. Both respected more by purists of their respective sports than by national media, it seems like. Both misused earlier in their career (KD at SG and Rodgers on the bench.) Both have pretty fundamentally unmimic-able games. Both have been MVP and best players on championship teams. Both overshadowed by having one of the best all-time players in the sport playing at their position during their career. Both can seem bored during games, and can quietly have unbelievable statistical games. And most importantly, both are pretty emo dudes.  Lamar Jackson and Giannis. Extremely unusual physical tools, really unlimited potential for improvement. Perennial playoff contenders in small cities where they're by far the most famous athlete.    Jalen Ramsey and Anthony Davis. Both cried their way out of bad teams to get to LA so that they didn't have to have the responsibility of being the best player on a team."
"Im just imagining him literally shooting the ball every time he touches it on offense no matter where he is, then turning into prime Kawhi Leonard on defense lol"
"Kawhi leonard, the only player I've ever seen Lebron get visibly upset about coming back into the game to guard him."
Kawhi hasn‚Äôt anyone said Leonard?
Kawhi Leonard. Because you can only talk briefly with the man himself.
Kawhi Leonard going wild.
Right below Igoudala and 2014 Kawhi Leonard
"Suns got through this year because LeBron/ AD/ Kawhi all got hurt in the playoffs (along with Klay), obviously maybe the Suns beat them all healthy but if you asked that to any serious expert at the start of the year, they probably take an LA team  Toronto got its title in a year KD and Klay got hurt  Shit the Warriors got a title against a Cavs team that lost two All-Stars in the playoffs   Not to mention Dame and CJ made the WCF without Nurk and starting Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless at the wings with Meyers Leonard and Kanter platooning center  If they are healthy and playing in a groove, on a team that is plus Larry Nance and Norman Powell, with a bench that plays better defense than Kanter and Melo, they could easily make a legitimate run  People act like winning a title is being able to put out the best team in 2k when in reality it is finding some elite players and trying to complement them as best you can, working to become an elite team that can compete with anyone and hoping everything falls your way one year  People had the same doubts about the Mavs the year they beat the Heatles, but the team gelled, Dirk put up an all time run, and they got the ring"
"I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure the commenter is saying when you're as rich as Kawhi Leonard already is, the extra money doesn't change his life.  Like I think this was the point...he's showing up for shitty work responsibilities just like everyone else. It's better for him though, becaus he's getting big bucks. But then again, he doesn't really need the money at this point, so maybe it's not better."
Kawhi Leonard going crazy!!
*KAWHI LEONARD GOING CRAZY*
"That‚Äòs possible, but not likely considering that Kawhi Leonard money could buy you one of the best accountants in the world to keep your money safe (and growing) for decades to come."

"&gt;I very strongly doubt that Kawhi Leonard is going to push a trade for a star  Why not? That's how they ended up with Paul George, after all."
"Is the type of guy that's interesting on paper ,but then up close you realize he can't really score or protect the rim vertically. He's like a modern day kwame Brown or Jason Collins, and the league doesn't really value that kind of player anymore.  His main contribution to the league was being the one guy that can shake hands with kawhi Leonard and not be impressed by his hand size."
Body language master Kawhi Leonard
"Yep, assuming Draymond wins in 2016 FMVP rankings would go IMO (Only using Finals performance, not playoffs as a whole):  1. Kevin Durant 2017 2. LeBron James 2012 3. Kevin Durant 2018 4. Kawhi Leonard 2019 5. LeBron James 2013 6. Dirk Nowitzki 2011 7. Kobe Bryant 2010 8. Draymond Green 2016 9. Kawhi Leonard 2014 10. Andre Iguodala 2015"
"&gt;Who‚Äôs better all time between Kawhi Leonard &amp; James Harden?   Kawhi is higher for me on the all-time rankings if that's what you're asking. Two rings vs Zero rings.  &gt; Also who do you think is the better player right now (not considering health or Kawhi‚Äôs ACL)?  If nobody was hurt, I'd take Kawhi by an inch, but realistically Harden is better since injuries happen; rather often for Kawhi.  &gt;  &gt; Who‚Äôs more underrated between the two?  Neither are what I'd call ""underrated"". Though if I had to pick, Kawhi sometimes gets underrated because of his injuries and Harden sometimes gets underrated because of his lack of accolades.  &gt;  &gt; Starting a team from scratch and your options are Kawhi or James (not considering health), who‚Äôre you going with?  Harden, if I'm just basing my team on the guy."
Kawhi‚Ä¶. No contest  Harden better scorer but Leonard better all around
‚ÄúKawhi Leonard going crazy‚Äù
Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard is not the GM. The Clippers would still like to be a competitive team this year‚Ä¶
"I very strongly doubt that Kawhi Leonard is going to push a trade for a star, especially one who will likely be available via trade next Summer (and for cheaper), for a season where he won't even play due to injury."
"Pascal Siakam for Kawhi Leonard?   P - if you're reading this, I'm sorry and I still love you."
"Kawhi ""Larry David"" Leonard"
"They need strength in numbers this year with Kawhi Leonard out for the season. If anything, this seems like a move I'd make next Summer. Would be dreadful to have something injury-related to happen to Wall this season that would cost him time next season."
"We can have an actual discussion if you want. I understand injuries happen every year. What doesn‚Äôt happen is the literal most injured playoffs in nba history. [It‚Äôs not even an exaggeration.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/basketball/nba-record-all-stars-playoffs-injuries.html). It broke the all time record for most all stars missing. Not just that, it gets even worse when you consider exactly who was missing. You have Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden all either leaving early or playing on one leg. That‚Äôs 3 of the top 5 players and another top 10 player. Then you have Kyrie, Jaylen brown, Jamal Murray. All great players that would have changed the tides of their respective series. It‚Äôs clearly not just another ‚Äúan injury happened‚Äù year. It‚Äôs very rare for both the eastern and western teams to make it through because the best teams in the conference all suffered major injuries. Most years the clear cut best team in the league wins, some seasons the second best team wins because of an injury, but it‚Äôs very rare for the 4-5 best teams in the league to Duke it out because 1,2, and 3 all got hurt. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying."
Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard vs peak Hakeem Olajuwon.   Given our current roster construction I‚Äôm taking Hakeem.
Do you really think Vince Carter is better than kawhi Leonard?
"Michael ""I taught Shaq everything he knows"" Olowakandi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kawhi ""too shy"" Leonard."
"Fair to say that current KD is the best player that has ever played for the Nets, however he is not their ‚Äúgreatest‚Äù player ever in terms of legacy with the franchise. A similar example would be Kawhi Leonard with the Raptors."
From 2011-2018 the only all nba first team player lebron beat in the east was derrick rose in 2011. Literally kawhi leonard made all nba first team in 2021 and that team was better than every team lebron faced from 2011-2018. There is a reason why after making 8 straight finals lebron missed playoffs in the west (lakers had a losing record when he played in 2018) and lebron got his first round exit this year. In fact lebron without ad in the west missed the playoffs and lost to the first round. Luka without an ad type player had historic stats in the postseason which is actually really impressive.
"Duncan? Funny how you managed to leave out some of Duncan more well known teammates like David Robinson, manu ginobili, Tony Parker, and kawhi Leonard. Duncan beats Lebron with manu, Parker and kawhi Leonard on his team. Dirk made one of the most amazing run in nba history and is the only one that can legit claim that he didn‚Äôt have a super team. Lebron choked there but that‚Äôs about it.   Your whole argument that tried to diminish what Lebron did in the east can easily be dismantled with a simple exercise of switching Lebron with any superstar oh his generation and see how they would fare on his team and how he would fare on their team."
"&gt;When you‚Äôre under contract you don‚Äôt have the choice of looking for another job.   A contract isn't indentured servitude. You can break the contract at some cost when it doesn't work out.  Furthermore, idk if you've ever managed people but if you treat people like shit, even those who do show up don't do their best work. Remedial management 101 is to not treat people like shit.   &gt;Idk why you seem to think this is some uncharacteristic and inexcusable situation.  I didn't say it is uncharacteristic  or inexcusable. It is in fact a common situation. Management treats its contract people as shit and then have surprised pucachu face when they don't get stellar employees.    &gt;Your job involves you being in the public eye.  Yes. And there are ways you can build a person and ways you can tear them apart. The sixers are tearing him apart. Do you think any player is perfect?    &gt;If you do your job poorly your boss is gonna criticize you.   If you do your job poorly in one area and seller in others, then a good boss will acknowledge  your successes and find a good way to tell you what you need to improve on, including suggestions what to work on.  &gt;That‚Äôs what happened to Ben. For four years we‚Äôve been talking about the major holes in his game and how they hinder his team especially in the playoffs, and moves have been made to compliment bens game, going as far as to get Embiid, the best post scorer since Shaq, to take like 8 jumpers per game to space the floor more for Ben. Despite all that he hasn‚Äôt improved even a little bit on those weaknesses. He deserved to get publicly criticized.    Ok Ben sucks. Then wtf are they asking for him as if he is a healthy Kawhi Leonard?   Ben Simmons has a lot he is already bringing and a lot to improve. He is not perfect. The front office if unhappy have shopped him around. That is fine. They have however done this in a nasty way. That is not fine. Again when you treat your employees as shit, don't have a surprise Pikachu face when they start doing shit work like not showing up. In fact, given how the sixes treated him wtf should he not work on his game in private and not risk injury on the court? Contract or not, when a relationship  becomes toxic you can have one side behave shittily and the other suck it up. I mean you could hope for it but it is irrational  to expect it.     &gt; &gt;And it‚Äôs not even like they were saying he was trash. Embiid said the momentum changed after a horrible Ben play that he completely sugarcoated, but then said it led to some empty possessions by him and took all the blame. Embiid who 80% of the time played like an mvp took the blame over a dude that took 3 shots in the last 3 second half‚Äôs.   Embiid is not thr FO.  &gt;Doc just said he didn‚Äôt know if he was a championship point guard. What else is he supposed to do? Lie after what everybody saw ? Saying idk is the most neutral answer.  No it is not. Thr most neutral answer is to not say anything or to discuss Ben's positives and negatives. Especially doc who propped up his son for years...   &gt;And PROFFESIONALS take stuff like this as motivation and fuel to work harder. They don‚Äôt get pissy and ghost their teams.   Lulz and vulshit. Professionals know their worth and don't lack the management boots just because they are professionals. They stand up for themselves. Which is what Ben is doing. After this summer wtf should he risk injury for thr sixes FO?   Any working relationship  is based on respect from both sides. Regardless  of his flaws, the sixers FO have treated him like shit this summer but expect things to be hugs and kisses from his side? No the world doesn't work this way. Maybe those who are desperate to feed their family decide to suck up asshole bosses (and no judgement on that-- people got to do what they got to do to feed their families) but this is not this situation. Noone should have to put up with asshole bosses and Ben is lucky to be able to afford to avoid them for a while.  &gt;Phil Jackson used to talk to the press about shitty performances by Kobe and MJ and pippen and everyone on the team when they underperformed or cost them games. Popovich does the same.  Bulshit. Popovich doesn't air dirty laundry in public. He is extremely  skilled in and careful to not be offensive. He complements the players, and only criticizes the play. Popovich is the example of how he took a team that collapsed in the last few minutes of a championship game 6 and built up the SAME team next year to win. He didn't go say that so and so may not be a good player.  Some players thrive on being called out on their bad plays. Some do not. A good coach coaches hwta the player needs to excel. Not sure wtf you think Doc is doing but he has yet to prove he can get the best of anyone. It is not clear that he can coach a championship team at all.   &gt; Doc did similar things in LAC talking about PG.  Lulz. And LAC did spectacularly under him? Thank you for the belly laugh. And for pointing why Doc sucks as a coach. He wasted enormous talen in the LAC big three, he displayed blatant nepotism for his son, and he condoned the whole dickishness with a certain player and the man's.     &gt;trades or trade demands or trade talks or ghosting the team didn‚Äôt happen in any of these situations. Cause these players had small enough egos to accept the criticism and use it to work harder and improve their games.   Lulz. No. It is because that stuff was not being done. Now Leonard has demanded trade. Davis has and others. So now it is a thing.  And btw let's point out that doc achieved shit nothing with his coaching of LAC but the above mentioned waste of talent   &gt;But not Ben, cause whether his ego is too big or he just can‚Äôt be bothered to work on his weaknesses at all, he‚Äôs too good for that. If he‚Äôs offended he deserves a change of scenery. Pathetic shit.  As pathetic as all the other star caliber players that have sat out games and demanded trades. Such is thr nba today. If the NBA gave a shit about this behavior they should have made rules about this when it started. This is the NBA today where players do sit out games and do demand plays.  The only thing pathetic is you thinking that management can insult a person and that person should just take it because wanna contract.  Nope. Noone should have to deal with shitty bosses."
"I figure the reverse Skip Bayless would be someone like Kawhi Leonard, a guy who is a great athlete and knows a ton about basketball but doesn't talk."
"‚ÄúWiggins is going to be a more athletic Kawhi Leonard, at the very least!‚Äù - this sub, circa 2015."
"He's obviously a good player, but Raptors fans act like he is prime Kawhi Leonard."
"&gt;One has happened significantly more often than the other.  You're right about this, but I think it proves a point you're trying to fight against. There's been a number of high profile players who have asked for trades (Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden), but it's hard to find any that just showed up and played hard for their team after doing that. Some were traded before it got to that point, and in the rest it became a mess.   About the only example I can think of when someone made a trade demand and still showed up and played hard and it wasn't a mess was when Kobe Bryant did it in 2007. But IMO that's an anomaly because he had a No Trade Clause, so it led to a stalemate between he and the Lakers, where he realized any trade package the Lakers would get for him would make his new team weak enough that he'd no longer want to go play there anymore. As a result he just stayed (and then the Lakers ended up being much better than he'd expected).   I think it's far more likely that this Simmons thing gets messier and the Sixers eventually give up and just trade him for whatever they can. If you're expecting Ben Simmons to show up and play great for you guys to rehab his value, I think you'll end up disappointed."
"&gt; they feel like they have nothing to lose.   I guarantee you that Philly does not feel like they have nothing to lose where they can afford to just piss away the next couple years playing ""who can be more petty"" with one of their star players. Do you think Embiid would be on board with them screwing around during his prime like that? Philly has a lot to lose. They need to resolve this situation quickly before it becomes even more of a mess for them, and simply getting Ben Simmons in line is not their goal. They want to trade him and hopefully for pieces good enough to keep them in title contention.   We've seen other teams try to fight these battles of wills with disgruntled stars before and the teams always lose. Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, James Harden, etc. In the end the teams have more to lose and always give in. No team can stomach a disgruntled star player for very long, [no matter what they might say in the press.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30338326/sources-houston-rockets-willing-get-uncomfortable-james-harden-russell-westbrook?platform=amp)"
"Only one of them was going up against Kawhi Leonard though.  Both their numbers are great, I just think Luka is clearly better as an individual and the Mavs are less far along in finding a well fitting supporting cast."
He was going against Kawhi Leonard...
And the Clippers didn't have Kawhi Leonard. Not even comparable in the slightest

"pandemic P  doc ""3-1"" rivers  patrick ""next 5 years are mine"" beverly  kawhi ""load manage"" leonard  what a meme team the Clippers were last season"
"its more that they went to the finals and then got pumped in the first round, they failed to play as well the next season.  i mean the raps lost kawhi leonard and danny green and went 7 games in the second round the next season - heat should at least have gone somewhere."
*since Kawhi Leonard lol
I'm a Spurs fan and Kno all bout DAT   It's so exciting when a young guy gets minutes  Last young guy to get starter minutes for us... As a rookie?   Kawhi fucking Leonard
Healthy Kawhi Leonard
"We traded away Kawhi Leonard for George Hill, Pacers."
Pacers traded draft rights to Kawhi Leonard for George Hill (aka the hometown kid)
George Hill for Kawhi Leonard on draft night. Woof
"Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for Demar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, a first, and cash considerations has to be one of them."
"There's a trade that's talked about but not enough, IMHO. That's Demar Derozan, Jakob Poetl, and a 2019 FRP for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.   At the time of the trade, DDR was (rightfully) viewed as a negative value contract. He bounced back a bit on the Spurs but he also locked them into the treadmill of mediocrity. Poetl was intriguing and has evolved into a defensive anchor for the Spurs but isn't exactly a world beater out there. Danny Green is still one of the league's better 3&amp;D players, and Kawhi was (and is) an MVP-caliber player in his prime. Yes, he had one year left on his contract and was widely rumored to be interested in going to LA, which of course was 100% true. He was also done with San Antonio, and that forced their hand. However, they almost certainly had better offers on the table.   Overall, it was an absolute steal for the Raptors. Na√Øve observers saw that the Raptors got an All-Star back for Kawhi and were happy, but the correct move (in terms of winning a championship in the future) was to trade for more assets rather than chasing the 8 seed with an aging Demar Derozan. That trade happened in 2018, and the Spurs have finally accepted the invetiablity of rebuilding. Instead of having 3 years to tank, get more assets, and build a new core, they spent that time missing the playoffs or getting gentleman's swept by the Steph-less Warriors. Yes, Popovich probably didn't want to tank. At the time, there were rumors that DDR was basically a going-away present to Pop so he could retire without the bad taste of a ruined season. However, he's still the coach now, so that basically amounted to nothing. That draft pick ended up being Keldon Johnson, so time will tell how much that pick was worth. At 29th tho, the value of the pick before it happened didn't exactly make up for losing Kawhi.  From Toronto's perspective, just getting off DDR's terrible contract was a massive win. He was terrible in all of their previous playoff runs. Not only did they get off Derozan, they got Kawhi MF Leonard and Danny Green for Jakob Poetl and a 2019 FRP. It turned out to be a Kawhi rental, but that didn't matter because they won the championship. What's more, Kawhi leaving was still preferable to being stuck with Derozan's contract. Even if they hadn't won the championship, it would still have been a great move with very little opportunity cost."
"LeBron was technically traded to Miami. Of course it wasn't a real trade, but Miami did throw some picks that weren't going to be valuable anyway to Cleveland.  And I know you said don't mention Harden, but words can't describe how stupid and awful that was. The Thunder gave away championships with that trade. And the common theory is the had to do it due to the salary cap, but that wasn't even true.  With that said, my answer is the Pacers trading George Hill for Kawhi Leonard."
"They don't have an exciting team culture, their culture is amazing but it minimizes player personality and they failed to get back a decent return for Kawhi Leonard. They should have taken Ingram and/or Lonzo Ball and ran away with the picks."
Kawhi Leonard was your franchise star and Kyle doesn't play up north any more
Clippers. I loved the Lob City teams because Chris Paul is one of my favourite players ever. Kawhi Leonard might be my favourite player ever so I like them now too.
He was traded 1:1 for Kawhi Leonard so yeah‚Ä¶
"Yep, and meanwhile he's not nearly as injury prone as a bunch of other superstars are. Look at the number of missed regular season games over the last 5 seasons before this one:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old  Why is AD the one who's considered the most injury prone?"
Yeah... the injury excuse falls rather flat when the opposing team was missing \*Kawhi fucking Leonard\*
Kawhi Leonard is seriously overrated on all-time lists considering how consistently injured he is.
"Whatever you say buddy, keep thinking he's Kawhi Leonard."

Kawhi Leonard has now had two massive leg injuries and will have missed two seasons because of them.  He will never be the same and he basically just fleeced the Clippers with that last contract.

Is kawhi leonard faking another injury?
"Serge was awesome in the finals. No doubt. That wasn't in dispute, or any part of the topic...so was Kawhi, but again, not relevant.     I chose one year, 2019, against your claim he's been the best defensive player in the playoffs every year since 2014. He wasn't the best defensive player in those playoffs. Gasol was.      It's debatable who was better in the finals (Gasol didn't need to be out against smaller players so he wasn't. I'm too lazy now, but I may have confused his offensive production with the previous series...you can look it up if you want) but he was definitely better in the previous rounds. He was absolutely a difference maker for the Raptors.     It's not exactly like that's a commonly accepted theory, so I'm not sure why you're so confident in that assessment.      Bill Russell, Hakeem Olajuon, Dennis Rodman, Michael Jordan, David Robinson, Gary Payton, Ben Wallace, Scottie Pippen, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Wilt Chamberlain, Kawhi Leonard, Dikembe Mutumbo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar....there's 15 and I disagree Draymond is better than any of them."
"Regarding the situation with the Spurs, that's not what happened.   He got injured the Spurs and the medical team diagnosed him with a chronic injury/condition. Him and his team, who had been planning to jump ship for a while, were incredibly frustrated of it getting out that he could potentially have a chronic injury as it would tank his potential value and complicate him moving to a larger market. They rejected the diagnosis. The Spurs said sure feel free to get another opinion. They did. And that second opinion? Same thing. Said it's a chronic injury. You're always going to be in some pain but it can be managed long-term. Again him and his camp rejected this. They got a third, and then 4th medical opinion. Which both came back again saying that the Spurs original diagnosis was correct. They finally found another diagnosis which I believe was a medical professional working for the Philadelphia Philadelphia Philadelphia sixers (who had a wonderful track record of having incredibly injured rookies and young players it should be added) who diagnosed him with something else.   Him and his team then used this to make it look like the Spurs were forcing him to play injured when the reality is he had a chronic condition. There is always going to be some levels of pain and there's no way the Spurs forced him to play. We're talking about the team that sat in their MVP in the early 2000s despite him begging his coach to let him play because they were worried it could threaten his career. They ended up losing in the first round of the playoffs by the way and pop has gone on the record that he regrets nothing.   At this point the Spurs begged him to come back so they could at least start a pain management regiment with him, as at the time he was away from the team not even working with their trainers. He agreed came back showed up to a couple of practices. He informed the Spurs he was feeling better and played a game or two. The pain came back the medical team once again pointed that this was the condition they had been warning him about and they needed to start getting him on his regiment.   At this point him and his camp essentially ghosted the Spurs for the next 4 months trashed them through the media made up stories and controlled the narrative. Being the Spurs and pop and all the local media kept their mouth closed. Once he left and the front office no longer had any reason to try to mend fences the local media came out with dozens upon dozens of diva like stories. Go look up my sa news Kawhi saga and there are stories going back 2 to 3 years before the whole thing happened.   His uncle had been causing drama for the Spurs behind the scenes for years and they had been covering it up hoping that eventually things would change and Leonard and his uncle would get past their very controlling behavior but it did not. I know that it's hip and cool to hate on the Spurs but the reality is Kawhi handled that entire saga about his poorly as a star ever could. To this day he still has that chronic condition by the way go look back at how the raptors and clippers have been managing him. The guy will never be able to play consistent games without pain management for the rest of his career. As predicted.  I have no issues with him choosing to leave the raptors nor do I have a huge issue with how he joined the clippers. But he deserves all the criticism he gets from those who followed that whole saga closely."
"Kawhi ""Mr. Peepee Poopoo Pants"" Leonard couldn't handle our thicc latinas and even thiccer breakfast tacos"
"Exactly the point.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, John Wall, AD and Jimmy Butler all had that option as well.  That's 8 max contract players (not counting Ben Simmons) in just the last couple of years. ESPN keeps pushing the Zion and Doncic want our narrative too which would be 11 players."

"Zach Lavine: he almost seems to glide with his movements. And every finish of his seems to be reminding everyone of his athleticism.  Kawhi Leonard: its just something about his jumper that makes you almost picture the path of the ball from his hand to the basket. His shot is like one of those oddly satisfying videos on the internet, you just know that everything will fall in place.  Jamal Murray: that man can almost walk on air with his layup package."
"Based on the moves they made, they thought Leonard would become more of a playmaker than he was in SA and that pg wouldn‚Äôt have fallen off athletically as much as he has( looks like he needs to lose 15 lbs). I don‚Äôt think they could have gotten the vets to come to a bottom feeder organization like the clippers without the legitimacy of two all nba guys like pg and kawhi, but shai would have solved all those point guard issues the clippers clearly struggle with and is possibly a better fit than pg with kawhi.  I‚Äôve heard Lowry as recently as this year say the same thing about kawhis playmaking, although he has improved since he was in Toronto a bit. Lebrun and pg would have been crazy though on offense"
"Prime kawhi very easily, I know it‚Äôs crazy to not pick lebron james and not think about it, but I just can‚Äôt think of a reason I would take him over a prime Kawhi Leonard."

Kawhi Leonard? Maybe you've heard of him?
I'd take Kawhi Leonard over Giannis Antetokounmpo in the postseason ten out of ten times but Middleton/Holiday are better than Lowry/Siakam
"Kawhi Leonard is 30, Simmons is already 25. Plus, Simmons is an objectively worse defender than Rudy Goebert, who‚Äôs 29. Simmons also averages less than 1 block per game at 6 foot 10.   He has quick hands and feet but doesn‚Äôt noticeably slow down great offensive players the  way Lu Dort, who‚Äôs 22 years old, Jrue Holiday, whose 31 years old, or even Davion Mitchell at 23 years old do."
Shout out to Kuzmania. He said he's gonna be Kawhi Leonard unleashed ü§£
Meyers and Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi Leonard would be a perfect fit on the kings too, trade for them straight up?"
"It's time for that Kawhi Leonard ""nice pass!"" gif"
"For the spurs:  Malcolm Brogdon - 2016  Kawhi Leonard - 2011  Jimmy Butler - 2011  Nikola Jokic - 2014  Last spot is between Derrick White, Norman Powell, and Larry Nance Jr. I'd say."
"You just said it yourself he‚Äôs in the first 7-8 years of his career, which means we haven‚Äôt seen the backend of his career yet and there‚Äôs a good chance his numbers my eventually dip like how the other guys I have mentioned. And I understood that you were speaking on at the end at his career, which is why I said he would have to at least make a deep playoff run or win an MVP or DPOY award to put him amongst those other guys. Stats alone with one ring (that most people credit LeBron for) isn‚Äôt going to put him up there with those guys because he‚Äôs lacking individual accomplishments. A guy like Dominique Wilkins has better overall numbers than Kawhi Leonard but no ones going to put Dominique ahead of Kawhi because he wasn‚Äôt as successful or won any individual award such as DPOY like Kawhi"
Kawhi Leonard did it for a full season before he was traded by The Spurs.  Some people forget so easily loo
"Super interesting. So:   a) he's not playing b) he's being evaluated c) based on the evaluation, that determines if he gets paid for not paying?   Kawhi Leonard didn't have to do this with his San Antonio ""quad"" issue. And I fucking hate simmons. But is this really fair?"

"&gt; You see, you are right, it is a game of chicken. But, the defining thing about a game of chicken is that if neither party swerves, they both lose! Right now, Morey is playing a game of chicken with Ben Simmons and it's absolutely possible that they both lose.  It's certainly possible, but the Sixers have 4 years and Ben has however long he's willing to go without getting paid. Which is *probably* a lot less than 4 years.   Is it possible that they both lose? Yes. But right now, the Sixers have a lot to risk by swerving and very little risk by staying on course.   &gt;Also, it's not purely black and white. This is not the stock market. There's actually people involved. So let me ask you this. If I'm the type of player that the 6ers want in exchange for Simmons, and I just watched Morey drag an All Star player through the mud for trade value, why would I risk my career with you?  It's my impression that Ben is not receiving a lot of sympathy from *anyone* in the league, not just other players in the Sixers organization. In short, the general consensus is that he's taking the idea of ""player empowerment"" way too far.  And there's good reason for them to dislike this. We're not that far off the next CBA negotiation, and Ben might be doing some very real harm to the negotiation position of the Player's Association.  The owners have generally been quite willing to offer the players more and more control over the last few CBAs. There's pretty good chance to think that development is about to come to a screeching halt.  When billionaires negotiate with millionaires, the billionaires tend to win.   &gt;If I'm Damian Lillard, and I have a similar contract to Simmons, I play in Philly for a year and it doesn't quite work, am I going to trust you to look after me?  I don't know Dame very well, but I have a very hard time seeing that he would find it acceptable to put himself in the situation Ben is in. Everything I've seen from Dame is that he's a consummate professional and fully accepts taking accountability for himself.   &gt;Nobody fined James Harden when he didn't show up.   I'm not aware of Harden ever going AWOL? The only practices I remember him missing before getting traded is where he was isolated by COVID-19 protocols.   If the Rockets considered him to be AWOL, then they have no discretion in the matter. The CBA doesn't say that teams *can* fine players for an unwarranted absence, it says that the team *must* fine them.   &gt;The Spurs continued to pay Leonard even after he was medically cleared by the team staff, and even after he asked for a trade.  The Spurs actually had discussions with the league on this, again, because the CBA says that they *must* fine the player if they believe the absence to be unwarranted. There was medical disagreement on whether he was cleared to play. It wasn't just Kawhi saying *""nah, I'm hurt""*, he had medical support for that.   The Spurs didn't *want* to fine him, which is why they sought clarification from the league.   &gt;Nobody, until now has dragged a star player through the mud like this.  I think *very few* people feel like Ben Simmons is being dragged through the mud. There's a reason why absolutely no players, including other Klutch clients, or the Player's Association are standing up for him.  Ben has very much put himself on an island.   &gt;Just because something is in the contract doesn't mean it's in your best interest to enforce it.  So far, it clearly is, though."

imagine if Kawhi fucking Leonard dropped the AOTY
Wait but why Kawhi Leonard presents?
Kawhi Leonard was all in tho and everyone knew he was leaving
"Correct. Bob McAdoo and Dominique Wilkins.  3 guys made it in, but weren't on the original list and were mid career. Dennis Rodman, Reggie Miller and Gary Payton.  There were other guys in the league / rookies but obviously didn't have enough resume, since it was 1996/97. That gets Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.  Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce were another year or two away and Dwayne Wade was a few more years.  The rest of the new list is all active. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook.  No real issues maybe other than Davis and Lillard, how do they stack up against full career Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Vince Carter and especially nearly full career Dwight Howard who seems a glaring omission. Does Grant Hill get any leeway for what he should've become and proved he could be (although for not long enough)?  Anyone likely a lock for this in 25 years when they do 100 years? Doncic? Jokic? Embiid? T. Young? Tatum?"
Yes. Last five FMVP‚Äôs:  Giannis Antetakounmpo  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard   *Kevin Durant(2x)

"MIAMI ‚Äî For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry‚Äôs face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      ‚ÄúI knew I was good,‚Äù Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. ‚ÄúI knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.‚Äù      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee‚Äôs tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      ‚ÄúWe all were mutually agreed that it was time,‚Äù Lowry said of leaving Toronto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      His journey in Toronto started with questions ‚Äî he was the team‚Äôs backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash ‚Äî crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      ‚ÄúThe city of Tampa was great,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúIt was just difficult because we didn‚Äôt know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.‚Äù      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team‚Äôs dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team‚Äôs president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      ‚ÄúSometimes franchises have to do what‚Äôs best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn‚Äôt say power ‚Äî but I had a little bit of, ‚ÄòListen, it‚Äôs not going to be a good look if we don‚Äôt collaborate on this together,‚Äô‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúWe all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      ‚ÄúWith DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.‚Äù      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,‚Äù Ujiri said at a news conference in August. ‚ÄúWe knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.‚Äù      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been super athletic,‚Äù Lowry said with a laugh. ‚ÄúI can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I‚Äôm not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don‚Äôt need to be jumping.‚Äù      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry‚Äôs sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry‚Äôs primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan ‚Äî ‚ÄúSmooth,‚Äù Lowry said of DeRozan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù      And of Leonard: ‚ÄúA machine,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúHe gets it done.‚Äù      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game‚Äôs quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      ‚ÄúI partly think it‚Äôs to get him going, because he‚Äôs got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,‚Äù Lowry said, adding that ‚Äúsome people can‚Äôt take it‚Äù and think Butler‚Äôs a jerk.      ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs just how he is,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúEverybody has different demands on themselves.‚Äù      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible. It‚Äôs a blessing, and sometimes it‚Äôs a curse because you‚Äôve got to be in some really great shape if you‚Äôre out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.‚Äù      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      ‚ÄúFreddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I‚Äôm the guy who was like, ‚ÄòYo, it‚Äôs on me,‚Äô‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúThey have to take the criticism, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.‚Äù"

Any top 75 list of best NBA players of all time without the name Kawhi Leonard on it is invalid
My 6'9 Ellen Degeneres said he has all star potential. Can Guard 1-4 and an efficient 25 PPG scorer. Basically Kawhi Leonard
we didn‚Äôt trade a rookie og for kawhi leonard lmao og‚Äôs value to our front office is even higher now
"&gt; Spurs were up at 20 at half; they got up to 25 in the third quarter.  It was 21 right before Kawhi got injured.  &gt; Also, why do you think what happened to the Rockets would happen to the Spurs? What does that series have to do with anything?  It proves that game 1s don't mean anything. you're acting like 1-0 lead is a 3-0 lead.  &gt; Defense. Kawhi Leonard. Spurs can adapt to the Warriors and slow them down (as you said the Warriors were cold, not me).  Yeah, forgot the Spurs were the only team ever that plays defense.  &gt; A ""Greatest Team of All Time"" doesn't get down 25 points at home in a Game 1, and only comes back because the opposing star is injured. Never has happened except once.  Says who? When was this rule made? And it was one half, not a game. Those Bulls almost lost to Reggie Miller. Every team has cold streaks, they're not robots.  &gt; Do you not understand how matchups in the playoffs work? So are you telling me the 2007 Mavericks wouldn't have beaten the Jazz that year because the Warriors beat them?  The problem is that ""matchups"" is more often than not used as an excuse so you can't just admit that your team was worse and was outplayed. Most of the time, if you can't explain why exactly one team is a bad matchup, then you're just BSing. Besides obvious examples like 2007, your team lost because they were worse, accept it.  &gt; The Spurs were 2-1 against the Warriors in 2014-15 season.  Regular season doesn't mean anything. There's multiple examples of teams that got swept in the RS only to destroy the same team in the playoffs. Playoffs are a different animal. And a 3 game sample size isn't big.  &gt; Unless you can give me a good explanation on why the Warriors weren't coming back with Kawhi there, and why Zasa did an obvious cheap on purpose shot on him  Because he's a dirty player? You know this isn't the first time he's done this, right? It's not some calculated conspiracy."
"&gt; The Spurs lead did not increase in the third, it actually DECREASED  Spurs were up at 20 at half; they got up to 25 in the third quarter.  &gt;Of course they could win in San Antonio, they did it twice.  Without Kawhi. That'd be like bragging you beat the Lakers without Kobe.  &gt;lol Houston literally blew them out at home.  And? Does anyone consider those Houston Rockets to be the 2nd greatest team of all time? The 2nd Greatest Team of All Time shouldn't be down 25 at home in  a Game 1. You think that's a good sign?   Also, why do you think what happened to the Rockets would happen to the Spurs? What does that series have to do with anything?  &gt;Yes  I meant to say without Steph and KD, my bad.  &gt;I like how you still haven't explained how exactly. Give me specifics, or is your entire basketball knowledge just buzzwords and ""mAtChUpS""  Defense. Kawhi Leonard. Spurs can adapt to the Warriors and slow them down (as you said the Warriors were cold, not me).  Were the 1996 Bulls ever down 25 points in a Game 1 at home? Actually, the 1998 Bulls blew out the Jazz by 42 points. Let me guess, that was just one game right? Jazz would have no problem beating the Bulls! Lol.  A ""Greatest Team of All Time"" doesn't get down 25 points at home in a Game 1, and only comes back because the opposing star is injured. Never has happened except once.  &gt;And lol Spurs couldn't even beat the choking clippers, no way they would ever beat the dubs.  Why do you keep saying this?  Do you not understand how matchups in the playoffs work? So are you telling me the 2007 Mavericks wouldn't have beaten the Jazz that year because the Warriors beat them?  The Suns were always getting mercked by the Spurs during the Nash era because the Spurs were a tough matchup for them. Just like with the Warriors."
He ended the season with a bad leg. [https://in.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-kawhi-leonard-game-3-raptors-bucks-injury-leg-update/4jqnbj22cboz1r0hsvnaf986q](https://in.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-kawhi-leonard-game-3-raptors-bucks-injury-leg-update/4jqnbj22cboz1r0hsvnaf986q)
Kyle Lowry  Kawhi Leonard
"Lemme take a crack at writing the opening, but it might sound pretty similar to their moment on kawaiis shot:  2019 was a big year for the NBA's eastern conference. LeBron had dominated the conference for almost a decade, having taken his team to the Finals from 2011-2018. However, in the summer of 2019, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference, making the title of Eastern Conference Champion suddenly available to teams that didnt have a LeBron James on the roster for the first time in eight years.   One of the teams with the best shot at that title, and a shot at the 2019 NBA championship? The Philidalphia 76ers.   Two of the men who led them in 2019 were home picked. Grabbed with the number 3 and 1 pick in 2014 and 2016 respectively by General Manager Sam Hinkie, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were a lethal, towering duo (slap player stickers on here). While the league was spared initially as Embiid sat out his first two years with a foot injury, his dominant, physical game brought back memories of transcedent big men of yore, and when Simmons debuted after his own year spent recovering from foot injury, it took him just four games to notch his first triple double. His dazzling passes and imposing drives drew comparissons to Magic Johnson and Lebron James, and Philidalphia fans everwhere salivated at the prospect of this duo leading their long suffering city to glory.   Then in 2018, with Lebron James and his Eastern Conference Champion hogging ways off in the West, 76ers management pulled the trigger. Recent #1 pick Markelle Fultz was swapped for Clippers star Tobias Harris, and a disgruntled Jimmy Butler was aquired from the Timberwolves after he politely and calmly asked for a trade, coach Brett Brown had perhaps the most lethal starting five in the East, winning 10 of their last 15 games to go into the playoffs determined to complete the Process and bring glory to the City of Brotherly Love.   Through the first round of the playoffs, it looked like they would do just that, finishing off the Brooklyn Nets in a gentlemans sweep 4-1, blowing them out in 3 of their 4 wins by double digits or more.   They went up 2-1 in the second round against the Raptors, before losing a tight game 4 where Philly had chances to take the lead down the stretch. They would get blown out in game 5, but showed life in game 6 where a balanced attack by all four of Phillys stars helped force a decisive game 7.  While game 7 was in Toronto, the 76ers definitely brought the spirit of Philidalphia with them north of the border, with all four stars once again scoring in the double digits, though Toronto's superstar acquisition in Kawhi Leonard went absolutely supernova to keep the game tied down the stetch, with Toronto having only 4.2 seconds on the likely last posession of the game.   Still, with the most dominant big man in the game in Embiid, a lethal closer in Jimmy, a steady distributing hand in Simmons, and a lethal terrtiary gunner in Harris, and a somewhat hobbled Toronto roster, the 76ers liked their chances in OT. All they had to do was get a stop and-   (Clip of kawhis shot)   Oh no. Who knew a basketball could bounce that many times and still go in?   And just like that, the fruit that was so carefully nurtured by Sam Hinkie from the manure of the early and mid 2010s Sixers rotted on the vine, then all the vermin in Philly descended and tore the fruit to pieces. And probably pooped on it some more.   Collapse music."
"It's not even a matter of takes and knowledge on the theme at all, just straight up basketball and evident facts and events.  One doesn't have to wonder on what is more playing basketball, more legit competition etc but especially straight up available game and whole between a certain number of guys competing in an even play field between Curry and CP3 cooking, Lebron and KD going crazy in 2017, Kawhi, Lowry, FVV, Gasol battling the Sixers and Bucks, Lebron's career high 51 and 8 8 vs the Warriors' all-time defense, Dame's run, all-time Harden Rockets going insane, 2018 Lebron vomiting number one all-time basketball for two months on one side.  And on the other side the Kevin Huerter-led crippled Hawks getting burnt down by 2021 Brook Lopez while the first option of your favourite NBA runner up is out nursing an injury (this is your NBA Eastern Conference Finals material), the Suns vs the Clippers with Kawhi Leonard having been murdered off camera or something, Harden freakishly getting injured to his leg stepping down on the court seconds into the series and the Suns and Lakers literally upping each other on the series based on who was injured or got suddenly back in again, instead of their back and forth on the court with their abilities, and looking like 5 versions of themselves in one 6 game series.  &amp;#x200B;  The highlight of the post season was Ben Simmons passing the layup, the various guys comically forgetting how to play basketball and a guy dropping 50 strolling back from an injury on up and coming young role players collapsing unto themselves when finding themselves shot up straight to the Finals while 36 years old CP3 was on an island getting chased and mauled by the opposing defense.  Which is funny considering the narrative of those locked and loaded 2018 best-version-of-themselves-Celtics (to this day even) with young stars and veteran basketball elites, and that team actually proving, winning and playing like a best team in the league with Tatum and Brown tearing it up especially, being just ''illegitimate, all rookies, 7 Games of nothing, like the Warriors vs the Lebron Cavs''."
"He's starting to get near the fringe 25 range as more and more greats come through. 10 years ago he'd be a lock for top 25, hell he'd be a lock for top 20 easily 10 years ago, but in that frame guys like Durant, Steph, Dirk, Giannis, Wade, Harden, Chris Paul have all created arguments for themselves to be top 25.   Top 11 is pretty agreed on, in some order: MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Bird, Magic, Wilt, Russell, Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Hakeem.  Then that means Barkley is going up against: West, Oscar, Dr. J., Steph, Durant, Dirk, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Kevin Garnett, Giannis, James Harden, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, Kawhi Leonard. That's 17 guys plus Barkley which makes 18, so you've got 18 guys competing for 14 spots. I think Barkley's got the argument over Pippen and Robinson and for now he's got the argument over Kawhi, Chris Paul and Harden, but it's all pretty close."
"Tanking his value is irrelevant to Ben. He‚Äôs not the Sixers, he doesn‚Äôt care what they get back.   And he has enough years on his contract that if he‚Äôs good at the next place it won‚Äôt affect his next contract (see: Vince Carter, Latrell Sprewell, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, etc, etc)"
"He is literally an elite defender, one of the best wing defenders in the league and legit guards 1-5 as shown by his Defensive Versatility Rating being 92.4 which is the second highest since 2013-14 with the highest being Rondae Hollis Jefferson at 94.2 during his only season as a Raptor. OG Anunoby this past season spent 18.8% of his minutes guarding PGs, 17.5% guarding shooting guards, 19.4% guarding small forwards, 26.3% guarding power forwards and 18.0% guarding centres. He also did the same the season prior, with him guarding the 5 positions at 16%, 24%, 24%, 22% and 13% leading the league in Versatility stat by Krishna Narsu. That came with OG being 94th percentile in isolation defense as well, which made him the 14th best defender in isolation one spot behind Kawhi Leonard which makes him elite. We got non-Raptors media guys from Zach Lowe to Kevin O'Conner to multiple SI writers to the Dunc'd On crew having argued that he is probably the best wing defender in the league. So this OG ain't elite at anything is just bogus.  He is also an elite at catch and shoot jumpers, being one of fifteen players in the league to attempt atleast 5.0 catch and shoot threes while making over 40%. Within those fifteen players, he is 6th in 3P% at 42.4%.  So how is he not elite at anything, when man is an elite wing defender who legit guards every position and is an elite at catch and shoot threes and has shown flashes of expanding his game into posting up other wings, facing up in the mid block, coming off pin downs, pick and roll off the wing or into the corner and breaking his man down into stepbacks as he has flashes this preseason and post all Star break last year. If that ain't intriguing to you, then who do you actually find intriguing?"
"I mean I'm just asking about the general idea of trading for non-star players who do not have long-term salary commitment, versus what your proposing which is to literally tie up a huge proportion of your spending power for four years on nothing. And yeah buddy does make you guys better than....nothing. And again I'm sympathizing with you guys on this. I had to go through the whole kawhi Leonard thing with my fan base and it was immensely frustrating, and in the end we did end up getting screwed by his antics and getting very poor value but I would have taken that over a year plus of the drama."
Tbf sources of Kawhi Leonard also told Skip that he was out for the rest of the playoffs due to his ACL and that it would require surgery despite the Clippers top brass implying otherwise.
Yes he is. They're just gonna let this media circus continue all season? They ain't competing for shit if that happens. Eventually they'll settle on a lower offer to ship him off somewhere he doesn't want to go. See Kawhi Leonard for further information and Simmons isn't remotely as good as Kawhi Leonard was.
Makes sense. Anthony Davis and kawhi Leonard did the same thing and sat out for a season
All-Fuck-Simmons 1st Team  Trae Young | Kevin Huerter | Kawhi Leonard | Jayson Tatum | Joel Embiid
"Good point. But Zion would be 23 years old, I have to think teams would line up and take the risk because he is such a tremendous talent. KD was 31 coming off a torn Achilles that a few years earlier destroyed Kobe Bryant‚Äôs career. Obviously they aren‚Äôt the same type of players, Zion depends on the burst and finishing but for his first contract there would definitely be teams out there willing to take a risk.  If he has 6 more years of constant injuries and then tore his ACL or something at 27 then maybe I could see hesitancy. But look at Kawhi Leonard, he has a whole career of injuries and tore his acl and still got the max. Less teams were probably interested but he still got one."
"It doesn‚Äôt, it also doesn‚Äôt mean Kawhi Leonard has any business in that sentence.  Also if Kawhi got one of his rings because Giannis choked‚Ä¶and then the Warriors exploded‚Ä¶kinda hurts your ‚Äúall-time playoff performer‚Äù narrative, just FYI"
This sub literally argued that Butler was better than fucking Kawhi Leonard during that Heat vs Lakers series.
"Kind of hilarious how the dude has already played with:   Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and now Chris Paul and Devin Booker."
Most everything you just said applies to Kyrie Irving too.  Or Gordon Hayward.  Or Joel Embiid.  Kawhi Leonard.  Jimmy Butler.  Kyle Lowry.  And those are just the top of market names with annual 10-20+ game absences.  Tons more as you move down the food chain.  I'm not trying to make the case that Brogdon hasn't gotten injured a lot.  I'm merely pointing out that he isn't so far out of the ballpark of what is considered normal these days that it's not much of an impact on his salary.  Teams no longer consider missing 15-20 games that big of a deal because it's become so common.
"James harden, giannis, Kyrie Irving,  kawhi Leonard, Joel embiid, Kevin Durant, Luka doncic, jayson Tatum, Jimmu butler, Paul George, jokic, Chris Paul, lillard   The list can go on and on"
Honestly I don't think anyone can run 5 out like last year's Clippers. 39% three point shooter Kawhi Leonard was their 9th best shooter by percentage from deep.
"Over the last 20 seasons, just 8 players have averaged at least 14 points, 5 rebounds and 2 steals while shooting 40+% from 3 through their first 16 games.  They are: Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Paul George, Trevor Ariza, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, and‚Ä¶ OG Anunoby"
"It's combination of a lot of things. No one will acknowledge it but there is a far higher number of star potential players than 10 or 20 years ago. Teams not only run more efficient offense than 5 years ago but also the increased spacing due to emphasis on 3 point shooting. The stars benefit the most in this scenario, especially the dynamic ones. Freakin Trae Young wouldn't have caught anyone's eye 20 years ago, he averaged near 30 in his 2nd season. Jordan Poole already looking better than Wiggins offensively due to his shooting prowess. Guys like Tatum and Mitchell are physical freaks but can also shoot the 3, leading to more efficient points per shot attempt.   Of course you don't have to shoot the 3 but unless you're a freak like Giannis or Zion, you better be able to like a Paul George or a Kawhi Leonard. We didn't have this many dynamic players 20 years ago. Bunch of defensive specialists with bad offense were everywhere back then, now guys like GP2 can barely get onto a roster because he can't shoot or guard multiple positions like Roberson."
Yeah but the sixers got the next Kawhi Leonard in zhaire smith
How about FMVPs without Season MVPS?  Jerry West  Kawhi Leonard   Jo Jo white  Dennis Johnson  Cedric Maxwell  Wes Unseld  James Worthy  Joe Dumas  Isiah Thomas  Chauncey Billups  Dwayne Wade  Tony Parker  Paul Pierce  Andre Iguodala
"Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Giannis"
"Ben Simmons Jrue Holiday Kawhi Leonard Draymond Green Anthony Davis.   Bench: Marcus Smart, Mattise Thybule, Giannis, Bam Adebayo  This lineup is allowing 50 points per game"
"he usually tinkers with rotations early in the season. it works when you have kyle lowry and kawhi leonard to carry you anyway regardless of the other 3 players, but this year is not it lol"
Nah Sixers were better. Kawhi Leonard just turned into prime Michael Jordan that playoffs  Simmons/Reddick/Butler/Harris/Embiid is an elite level team.
Kyle Lowry Jrue Holiday Kawhi Leonard Lebron James Marc Gasol   +   Fred VanVleet Alex Caruso OG Anunoby  Bobby Portis Serge Ibaka
"Raptors lose Kawhi Leonard, get Malachi Flynn... wait what?"
1: Jrue Holiday  2: Khris Middleton  3: Kawhi Leonard  4: Giannis Antetokounmpo  5: Bobby Portis  6: Alex Caruso  7: Marc Gasol
And the rest you‚Äôre coaching Kawhi Leonard and Paul George
"In 2009 he played 7 games and shot 36%. In 2010 he played 5 games and shot 40%. That's hardly a sample size to go by.  He may put more emphasis on the 3 point shot but there is hardly any guarentee that he would be anything more than 35% shooter. Westbrook, AD and Lebron all try to be better but they can't or aren't able to sustain it for someone like James.  Kawhi effiecincy is up there with KD/Steph and even trumps them at moments. He is also a DPOY when he feels it. Wade's playmaking hardly cuts that gap. In a League with KD, Curry, Lebron, Giannis and Harden - Leonard was considered the best at certain moments. I don't think that Wade could do so."
"Let us not forget the reincarnation of Jordan himself, Kawhi Leonard"
Kawhi Leonard is on the level of those three at full strength
In front on Kawhi Leonard‚Ä¶this is personalü§¨
"Not that I cosign what the person you're responding to said but I feel like AD gets a lot of blame. Hes a kid born in 93. Made himself a name on the pelicans, which got the attention of a superstar like LBJ, to make ad his right hand man on a new team. So far they've gotten one ring. And now that ad is 28 I'd say hes just now become a 'senior' bball player. So we should begin to expect more from him but as far as what hes done so far..its about as good as it gets. Outside of maybe kawhi leonard who is slightly older. But even then that's only 1 other person. Not that you went that hard on ad. But I just been seeing a ton of ad criticism lately. As if hes in his mid 30s and not a growing kid who admittedly has recently become a 'man'"
"Nope. You‚Äôre absolutely full of shit.   ‚ÄúCan you imagine him in a few more years experience and muscle? AD might never actually get a chance to be #1 on the Lakers after Lebron leaves‚Äù   Also people talking him up as a future all star, saying he‚Äôs currently the third best guy on the team, and saying he gives them Kawhi Leonard vibes. These comments are about a week old. I‚Äôm not even going to dig into posts from the off season, when y‚Äôall thought he could be traded for an actual All-Star."
Just realized Kawhi Leonard isn't playing. Dude is always so damn hurt. Extremely overrated player. At least Paul George plays. Kawhi nowhere to be found. Can't wait till he retires
"Yeah if I were to project kd playing for 5 more years. He would have the  same amount or 1 less all nba teams. Less defensive teams, same mvps but not eclipsing 36k points.  The difference is kd would have 3 to 2 rings all together as  finals mvp for his career.  No it wouldn't be the same your comparing two players that aren't the same in terms of primes. I compared two mvps. Kd , Malone   Your point is about leadership on how championships doesn't make you better. Pg13 and kawhi Leonard are extremely similar in career, but if you put the two championships kawhi got onto pg13. Who would be looked at as better or greater?"
"When you think about it, the bulls basically got a kawhi Leonard level player."
"&gt;no amount of heroics by Kawhi could have changed that  Fr. It's hilarious when people who don't follow our team make all sorts of declarations.   Like how someone was saying Leonard carried the Raptors, even though the team was different during the 18/19 run."
24/10 at 50% from the field (all of which are also his career averages) on a championship favorite‚Ä¶  Lmao. Reminder that your team has been relevant twice:  Kawhi Leonard and the time LeBron wrapped the Raptors around his dick for 4 straight games.
"I really like this comparison to the 2011 onwards Lakers. It's a rebuild that was very fortunate to end up with a championship all things considered. They traded away an insane amount of talent for Davis who has generally been injury prone but managed to be healthy for the 2020 run. Also that 2020 run was extremely fortunate as the Warriors came off of losing Durant and having a bunch of injuries an players aging out or leaving, Houston took a huge risk on Westbrook who ended up being hampered by COVID, and the reigning champion Raptors lost Kawhi Leonard. The Top 3 teams of the previous year all took huge hits and the Lakers were in the right position to capitalize. The Lakers also had a very fortunate bracket as all the strongest teams left (Nuggets, Jazz, Clippers, Mavs). I'm not discounting the 2020 championship or saying the Lakers couldn't have won in harder circumstances but they heavily regressed from that season as the West got way way better, which is pretty similar to how the West got even stronger in 2011 as the Lakers slightly regressed."
Curry: 85%  Klay: 15%  &amp;#x200B;  KD: 70%  Westbrook: 30%  &amp;#x200B;  Chris Paul: 60%  Devin Booker: 40%  &amp;#x200B;  Kawhi Leonard: 70%  Kyle Lowry: 30%  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron: 80%  Kyrie: 20%
Kawhi Leonard vibes.
"Kawhi ""The Combo Breaker"" Leonard"
"According to this article by the Ringer at the time, no other rental player has ever won NBA finals MVP.   It's such an aberration that the next best one-year rental season by playoff win share related to Tyson Chandler in 2011(Mavs), which Kawhi nearly doubled.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/14/18679089/kawhi-leonard-toronto-raptors-playoff-statistics-historical-context"
"&gt; The suns were killed for being a ‚Äúweak‚Äù western champ   No, they were killed for being gifted a pathetic route to the Finals:   \- Anthony Davis got injured and missed a chunk of the series + LeBron James was clearly nursing an injury as well  \- Jamal Murray misses the whole series  \- Kawhi Leonard misses the whole series  And before any of you idiots and/or Suns fans come at me with the ""b-b-b-but they didn't choose their opponents!"", don't. No shit they didn't choose it."
Was the Kawhi Leonard/Raptors team a failure too?
"Yeah lol, Derrick Rose won an MVP but a doctor should you prescribe Thorazine if you think he was better than Dwayne Wade or Kawhi Leonard"
"Tim Duncan might be the single most underrated defender in NBA history. That right there is pretty much the story.   Now, losing Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard and replacing them with DeMar DeRozan can kill just about any defense as well.  But the biggest thing is that Duncan was Duncan."
"Well then I don‚Äôt know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren‚Äôt good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we‚Äôve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they‚Äôre at risk of a shot clock violation."
"Kawhi ""in between Tobias Harris and Gordon Hayward in career points"" Leonard?"
"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/7/24/17607058/kawhi-leonard-trade-raptors-david-robinson   Here's the quote that I think summarizes the situation best: &gt;‚ÄúI think for Kawhi, it‚Äôs about growing up,‚Äù Robinson said on ESPN‚Äôs Get Up!, ‚ÄúRight? You step into that responsibility, man, you‚Äôre the face of the franchise. You can‚Äôt not talk, right? You‚Äôve got to let people hear your voice, not somebody else‚Äôs.‚Äù   Kawhi made that situation 100 times more difficult than it needed to be for everyone by never saying anything. It's like an ex that just ghosts you instead of initiating the breakup"
"Fultz breaking Embiids face, the fucking Kawhi Leonard shot... If I didn't know better I would call it karma from the basketball gods"

Two way superstar wing  Kawhi Leonard fits the bill
2 weeks before the draft I opined that Scottie Barnes might actually be the best player in the draft.  After the draft my fellow Raptors fans were freaking out. I defended the pick saying the Raptors clearly have a type. They saw how long and athletic worked with Kawhi Leonard and just wanted a team full of that.
"Agree-to-disagree, but I don‚Äôt think Young gets very far in the playoffs if he runs into a full-strength Clippers team every post-season.  That‚Äôs not to shortchange Young‚Äôs incredible playoff performances, but Luka has put up all-time great games and barely eeked out wins because Kawhi Leonard is on the other team."

This is gonna skew hard to modern players from within the last 30 years also it‚Äôs 2021 and this is the era of position-less basketball so I‚Äôm gonna put players at whatever position I want to       Guards- Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Klay Thompson   Forwards- Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Bird  Bigs- Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Giannis    Just crazy defensive versatility with this team and it‚Äôs full of shooting and elite interior scoring. Lots of players who can create a mid range and I wanted a large collection of stars who can also play well off the ball and can have impact if they aren‚Äôt touching the ball much."
To be fair he was literally 6‚Äô3‚Äù Kawhi Leonard with more hops and a ceiling of legumes
This is sport. People get hurt. Including Kawhi Leonard
"The Lakers will have approximately two bad years and then in 2025 they'll be, like, Zion Williamson, Kawhi Leonard, and Jayson Tatum. The fans won't complain. They will just be like ""see, people always want to come to LA."" And they will be right."
Kawhi Leonard
"Kristaps Porzingis yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Tim Hardaway Jr. gave a look of pleasant surprise. Doe Doe belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Luka Doncic hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kawhi Leonard hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Fuck Kawhi Leonard for choosing his fam over the Spurs
Kawhi leonard game 7 versus the sixers. Ohhhhhhhhh.
"lol KD has gone up against perimeter defenders like prime Kawhi Leonard, who is definitely better than mike on the perimeter. So to say what you just is quite ridiculous,   If basket was a 1-on-1 sport, KD is arguably the best player ever. Hes not getting sonned by anybody"
GOAT-Management.. or whatever Kawhi Leonard does
"&gt; Wouldn‚Äôt going further in the playoffs count as being more successful?  You said better, not more successful.  Losing to an all-time great team in 7 is not worse than beating the Clippers without Kawhi Leonard in the WCF."
Kawhi leonard would come back to ruin your life
"I kinda just want Kawhi Leonard to retire to allow the Clippers to actually get some high caliber &amp; healthy guys for Paul George. Playoff-P can be a frustrating guy to root for too, but at least he shows up every night."
Rappaport ones were a back and forth. The other guy deleted his own messages geez. How‚Äôs the man a snake any more than Kawhi Leonard? At least he‚Äôs never ghosted his own team &amp; coach.
Yet again an athletic wing is compared to Kawhi Leonard. When are we going to stop kidding ourselves here?
"Imagine trying to defend kd with no help defense. In a 1 on 1 he doesn‚Äôt even have to worry about where the help could come from. Oof.   If you‚Äôre under 6‚Äô7, it‚Äôs an automatic L. He‚Äôll just shoot or finish right over you. If you‚Äôre tall but not quick enough laterally, also not worth playing.   And you can‚Äôt just plan on finishing over a 7 footer at the basket 11 times. So also need to shoot it well. Generally probably need to be a decent scorer to keep up with the 2k created player that is KD.  Good candidates? Lol I dunno maybe Kawhi Leonard and Paul George? 2013 Lebron would be fun to see"
"Yes but did he do it against LeBron James, AD, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard with one hand tied behind his back?"
What an awful take.  He is way too mobile to be MKG lol. And it's not a stretch to think his ceiling is Kawhi Leonard (on the defensive side at least).
"Kawhi Leonard was the number one guy on a championship team in Toronto with 3.3 assists per game. You don‚Äôt need to be an offensive engine that everything always revolves around to win championships just because LeBron was. I‚Äôm not saying that that Tatum is ready to be the number one guy, it‚Äôs just not selfishness holding him back.   Beyond that, you should probably watch him play more if you‚Äôre still making the take that he‚Äôs playing selfishly. He‚Äôs actually been really great about moving the ball along when other guys have cleaner looks, and he also makes some absolutely crazy passes. He‚Äôs also started playing much more as an off ball player which opens things up for the whole team."
[Here](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/23/16693304/kawhi-leonard-trade-rumors-history-timeline-spurs-gregg-popovich)'s a quick rundown on what happened.
"Because I've seen him play.   Ben's strengths come primarily as an on-ball defender. It's the same reason Kawhi was never a true defensive anchor like Tim Duncan was, despite being one of the best perimeter defenders of all time.  To genuinely anchor a defence it's not enough to shut down an opponent's best player because good teams have multiple best players nowadays. You've got to be able to impact possessions that don't directly involve you.    Put Simmons in Sacramento and teams will just start to employ the same [Kawhi-solation tactics](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/) that were effective against the late-stage Spurs.   The difference being the Spurs still had a capable defence outside of Kawhi, even after Duncan's retirement. Pull Simmons away from the play and suddenly the 30th ranked Kings are back to being shit defensively.  Lets say they're playing the Nets. Simmons guards Durant. Durant steps away from the play and Harden plays 4v4 offence. The Kings can't handle that possession well and Simmons' defensively playstyle/role doesn't allow him to ease up on Durant.   Someone like Embiid is an anchor because even when he's not involved in the 1-on-1 matchup, his rim protection and PnR defence still makes an impact on just about every possession. Embiid shutting down LMA is still able to deter Harden from attacking the paint."
"The classic 1 on 1 defensive scheme where the entire team is focused on the star player.    https://imgur.com/a/Z2hh1ni (This is from 15 seconds of watching Bucks vs Raptors recap)     And this is Kawhi Leonard, arguably the greatest wing defender this generation. He also has the support of Marc Gasol, another DPOY winner as the rim protector, yet the coach still finds it necessary to have everyone else on the team focus on that one specific star. It's a bit unfair to expect Curry or anyone else to be able to guard another star 1-on-1."
Any trade where you get Kawhi fucking Leonard in his prime is a good trade full stop.
"My guess is that once LeBron starts kicking and punching opponents in the groin so many times that the league has to suspend him for it or when LeBron intentionally steps under Kawhi Leonard after a shot and breaks his leg in a conference final or when LeBron fires his mouthpiece at a Cavs fan sitting courtside because he disagrees with a ref's call, then maybe he'll be considered a dirty player."
Kawhi Leonard has entered the chat
"The Clippers haven't won much, but have been a consistently solid team for the last decade.  Our last owner was ousted after being caught on camera making racist comments, and our new owner has built a solid foundation with a ton of financial backing.  Our last year was our best year to date! We have two stars in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. We just need a championship now.  Edit: Lakers won the championship two years ago, but largely haven't lived up to expectations besides that year."
"Ok but it isnt quite the same when Kawhi Leonard, Ibaka, Gasol, or Kyle fucking Lowry are there lol. Why are people talking like this is the same roster?   Like LOLLL why didnt the Lakers win easier? Why didnt they just pass to that dominant big man who cant shoot fouls but is unstoppable inside? Oh? He hasnt been with the team in years?  No shit this doesnt work missing basically the 4 key parts to that defense depending on the opponent? lol"
"2019 Raptors had Kawhi Leonard, their defense is elite"
"Fun fact, Wiggins has a higher career PPG than Kawhi Leonard."
"Its not as easy when you dont have kawhi leonard, danny green, kyle lowry, marc gasol, serge ibaka, either"
"He had Kawhi Leonard on him for 4 games, basically, and was used to draw Kawhi out to the 3 point line for Luka to penetrate the lane. I felt that Carlisle really failed KP by not running better plays to get him open/get to his spots when Kawhi switched or was on the bench; granted KP's offensive and defensive production weren't good by any stretch of the imagination but volume shooters typically suck when they're relegated to strictly catch and shoot roles."
"Did you hear Kawhi Leonard, yes that Kawhi Leonard, is currently out on injury?"
"I'm not sure why you're including Kawhi in that.  The midrange kings are typically KD, Paul, Derozan. Leonard only have one season shooting over .500 from the midrange, and it was his sophomore season specifically from from 3-10 feet where he shot (.510)."
You know who else is a system player? Kawhi Leonard  Fr tho the problem with that thinking is you actually have to fit the system.
"""I am here today to once again ask for your support, this time against Kawhi Leonard and New Balance."""

Yeah we should use RAPM instead cus it adjusts for lineups. In which case the list is (1000+ minutes):   1. LeBron James 7.66  1. Draymond Green 7.66 	  3. Manu Ginobili 	7.13   4. David Robinson 	5.34   5. Kawhi Leonard  5.02  7. Tim Duncan 	4.71   8. Kevin Durant   4.56   9. Kevin Garnett 	4.56   10. Stephen Curry  4.38   11. James Harden 4.34  Data is only available up to 2019 tho
"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.	Stephen Curry	6.23   4.	Kevin Durant	6.03   5.	James Harden	5.95   6.	Magic Johnson\*	5.93   7.	Damian Lillard	5.48   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.35   9.	Chris Paul	5.18   10.	Larry Bird\*	5.12   11.	John Stockton\*	4.90   12.	Kyrie Irving	4.83   13.	Tracy McGrady\*	4.69   14.	Julius Erving\*	4.64   15.	Anthony Davis	4.64   16.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.62   17.	Kawhi Leonard	4.55   18.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokiƒá	7.45   4.	Kevin Durant	6.44   5.	Stephen Curry	6.37   6.	Tracy McGrady\*	6.17   7.	Magic Johnson\*	6.08   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.42   9.	Larry Bird\*	5.40   10.	Kawhi Leonard	5.35   11.	Julius Erving\*	5.33   12.	James Harden	5.26   13.	Giannis Antetokounmpo	5.23   14.	Chris Paul	5.23   15.	Dirk Nowitzki	5.19   16.	Damian Lillard	5.14   17.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	5.04   18.	Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."

"Kawhi wakes up in a cold sweat.  &amp;nbsp;  K: Georgie! It happened again! üòîüòîüòî  &amp;nbsp;  Paul George, quick to comfort his wife, turns to face him.  &amp;nbsp;  P: Sh-sh-sh-It's ok baby.

P: No problem baby, I'll always protect you  &amp;nbsp;  Kawhi sits up and looks at Paul, their faces illuminated by only the moonlight breaching the cracked curtains.  &amp;nbsp;  K: Could we maybe go another round ü•∫üëâüëà?  P: Of course K. You know you don't have to ask me.  K: Thanks babe üíû. But can we switch positions? These legs don't work like they used to ü§ß...  P: I get it baby. I'll always accommodate your injuriesüíï.  &amp;nbsp;  The two NBA stars engaged in an act so intimate and private that it would be disrespectful reveal the true details.  &amp;nbsp;  **3 Weeks Later**  &amp;nbsp;  Kawhi approaches Paul with a unsure look.  &amp;nbsp;  P: ""What's wrong babyüôÅ?  K: *Sigh* ... Georgie ... I'm pregnant üò≥.  P: Oh my god!!! That's wonderful news baby! We're gonna be parents!  K: NO! Baby, it's not good! The playoffs start in 2 weeks! I can't play while I'm pregnant!  P: Oh my god baby... you're right. It would be dangerous for you and the baby's health. Don't worry K, we'll figure this out.  K: Thanks for being so understanding babe ü•∞.  &amp;nbsp;  The playoffs start, and Kawhi plays the first round. He ends up not feeling well and needs to stop playing. He consults the team, and decides on an exit strategy.  &amp;nbsp;  [Wojnarowski]: Clippers medical staff say that Kawhi Leonard tore his right ACL in Game 4 against the Utah Jazz. Officials say it will require surgery and he will be out for atleast 9 months."
"It's even funnier than that, as it started with [Westbrook calling Kawhi](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31937985/how-two-phone-calls-two-years-apart-led-los-angeles-lakers-landing-russell-westbrook).  &gt; Westbrook had become a father of three the previous November, and while he'd made a home and carved a Hall of Fame legacy in Oklahoma City, the chance to live and play in Los Angeles, where grandparents and his large extended family and friends could visit every day, held deep appeal. &gt;  &gt; Teaming up with Leonard would be the fastest way there, so he placed the call, according to multiple sources. But Leonard didn't just take the call as one native son of Los Angeles to another, ponder it and file it away. &gt;  &gt; He used it. &gt;  &gt; According to multiple sources, Leonard then called Westbrook's teammate in Oklahoma City, Paul George, and told him he'd rather team up with him on a homecoming. &gt;  &gt; George had always longed to play in front of his family as well but had formed a close bond with Westbrook in their two seasons together in Oklahoma City and was content to stay. &gt;  &gt; Leonard's call upended all of that, though. And within a week, Leonard was teaming up with George -- not Westbrook -- for their hometown LA Clippers."
Kawhi Leonard and it‚Äôs not even close. There‚Äôs no debate to be had.
Ceiling? Ceiling ceiling? 100th percentile outcome? Kawhi Leonard.
Kawhi Leonard was better than Steph Curry in the 2019 Finals
"Right now (Nov 18 before any games played today), the West is collectively 106-112 and the East is 117-111 so the East has a better record against the West. This is being done even though the West has played 119 home games and the East has only played 104 home games. Several Eastern Conference teams have already make significant West Coast road trips (which is why teams like the Lakers, Clippers, and Warriors have played 12, 10, and 9 home games respectively).   I haven't tried to add up who has missed more games. Yes, the West is missing notable players like Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, and LeBron has missed time too. But the East has no Kyrie, Ben Simmons (who is very solid in the regular season regardless of his playoff issues), and the Bucks has been playing a mash unit a lot with all their top 4 missing time."
&gt; do not sleep on the 3peat  Kawhi Leonard stirs in the distance ready for his services to be called upon.
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
Deni is going to be a Kawhi Leonard/Draymond Green level defensive player down the track.  Only in his second season after coming off a broken ankle. His defense is already insanely good. **AND HE‚ÄôS ONLY 21**
Kawhi Leonard is the best player in basketball
[Kawhi Leonard in shambles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUF8MGH9Fh8)
"I think Tim Duncan is a top 10 player of all time but putting him in the Top 5 is overrating him. Some of those All-nba he got towards the end was when the center position was incredibly weak and he wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. Both of his MVPs where extremely close and he probably should only have won one. Best winrate in the NBA probably has more to do with the fact that he was always surrounded with a good team. What happened after duncan retired? the spurs won 61, 47(kawhi missed the first 27 games), 48 (no Dejounte Murray) games right around 50ish games each season, probably has more to do with pop being a great coach then it does with duncan. Duncan is also the only NBA center to fail to win an Olympic Gold medal -- and the 2004 Team USA he captained was a complete embarrassment, somehow getting blown out by Puerto Rico, which is obviously a US territory. I find Duncan to be overrated on the defensive end, often times he wasn't even the best defender on his own team. He only occasionally was the leading vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners, and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"[Jabari Young (Portland beat writer) straight up forgot him](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/04/24/defensive-player-of-the-year-voter-admits-he-just-forgot-about-draymond-green/)  &gt; When thinking of the candidates, Green‚Äôs name just slipped my mind, as Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, Memphis center Marc Gasol, and San Antonio‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard were the selections made. Once it was discovered Green was forgotten, a change was sought but after selections are submitted, all votes are final."
"&gt; Part of what made Kawhi look otherworldly on D with SA was him being afforded the ability to funnel the opposition directly into a position where they'd get locked down by Duncan.   Kawhi was still great on defense without Duncan LOL In fact, Duncan's the one who's played with DPOY teammates his whole career. first he had Robinson, then Bowen who was a three time runner up. Then Kawhi who's a 2 time winner. Robinson and Leonard both led a 1st rated defensive Spurs team without Duncan, the highest Duncan led a Spurs team in defensive rating without Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard was 8th."
Dray led the way by showing his DPOY HOF energy on one of the greatest scorers in all of sports. Shoutout to Kuminga as well; those Kawhi leonard shades are legit.
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard:¬†.277 ws/48¬†3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.¬†  I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt;¬†Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.¬†  Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.¬†  As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts¬†per hundred when he checks in,¬†that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.¬†  &gt;¬†Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.¬†  I don't know what your point is here with the¬†whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team.¬†Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.¬†  &gt;¬†And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here¬†because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient¬†scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.¬†  3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.¬†  I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.¬†  Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.¬†  The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.¬†  If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.¬†  [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"
Kawhi Leonard - 2 seasons on the Clippers  0 championships
Uh where the fuck is Kawhi Leonard
"For people who don't know its simple:   DeMar Derozan - 9 seasons in Toronto 0 championship   Kawhi Leonard - 1 season in Toronto 1 championship"
For people who don't know its simple:   DeMar Derozan - 9 seasons in Toronto 0 championship   Kawhi Leonard - 1 season in Toronto 1 championship
And Kawhi Leonard. My man always gets off scot free
The NBA isn‚Äôt about ethics. They‚Äôd most likely be at the bottom of the conference with Griffin not allowing them to be a good FA destination with his big contract.  Look how it turned out for the clippers: a top 5 and one top 15 player with a solid bench. Even if they don‚Äôt win the chip they have been forever changed as a franchise since acquiring Kawhi Leonard. Not to mention locking up PG for the next 5 years‚Ä¶
"I'm sure clippers fans are pretty happy that they made the right decision instead of sitting too long on that fat ass contract. They traded blake while they felt they could get a good haul and turned it into paul george and Kawhi leonard.   The clippers realized that he couldn't do it with an all time great like Chris Paul, then he's probably not doing it with anyone else either. Cold and calculated, but fair. Blake got paid money that will last for life. And besides, who's to say he wouldn't have soured on the clippers asap after realizing that they weren't going to win and he was getting older. We just watched Harden do it to Houston."
SJ really defend Leonard well one game when he was on the Pistons. His defence on Kawhi cost us that game.
"No, Kawhi Leonard and Michael Jordan are the only players to win FMVP and not finish the next season on the same team"
"You were traded for Kawhi Leonard, George.  Quiet down."
"man Shamet's career is so tragic, dude has been trade bait 3 times now as a rookie. Yes he's literally gotten to play with Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant and James Harden but mother of god the dude is treated like livestock"
I know what you mean but in some cases he‚Äôs arguably more dimensional than Harden in the sense Kawhi Leonard is more dimensional than Brandon Ingram
"how in the fuck is the Spurs future screwed up at all?  The Spurs are currently the 5th seed in the western conference with the easiest remaining schedule in the league while having been without their #2 option, have 7 players currently averaging double digits, and have $70+ million in cap space this offseason.  I'm not an idiot to think that the Raptors had the better offer. I'm on the same side as a HISTORICALLY GREAT FRONT OFFICE and completely trust their decision making. DeMar has been a fantastic player (contrary to what these bum ass casuals think about him), Jakob is a really fucking good defensive big, and Keldon is going to be a star.  they also just drafted Devin Vassell who was their highest draft pick since Tim Duncan and been their most NBA ready rookie since Kawhi Leonard.  also, Pop is the reason the Lakers only have LeBron and AD and not Kawhi as well, and the team they traded him to is currently sitting in the lottery.  but nah, keep trying to act like you know shit."
Sounds like AD went to the Kawhi Leonard School of screaming as he attacks the rim lol
"Landry Shamet is in his third season and has played with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden."
"Scenerio 1: let‚Äôs say Lowry had agreed to be loaned to the Cavs for 10 days. While playing for the Cavs, he gets a season ending injury. Who is responsible for his salary?  Scenario 2: Chris Boucher is catching up to Turner in blocks, only needs 5 more to pass him. Toronto has already played their full slate of 72 games, but due to the COVID ppd of games, the Wiz have 5 more games left in the season. He gets loaned to the Wizards to get those 5 blks.   Scenario 3: Kawhi Leonard is set to be a free agent. The Raptors see that the clippers‚Äô biggest need is a PG, so they send Lowry for the year. Lowry was actually sent to convince Leonard to come back with him to TOR the following summer, so they can run it back. Kawhi leaves and Ibaka joins them. Do the Clippers have a case for tampering against the Raptors?"
"&gt; Ask the Clippers how they feel about trading all their assets for George and Leonard  Feeling pretty great about it tbh, even with the way things went last year. We got 2 years, and possibly more if Kawhi stays, of actual title contention which for our franchise has never happened before. We were the 2 seed for the first time in franchise history last year and are looking pretty good so far this year. Even if we don't win it all, the trade will have still been worth it as it gave us our best shot at a title in franchise history."
"the LA teams combining would probably be better, but the NY teams combining would be pretty close behind.  ___  correct me if im wrong cause i dont follow them, but the LA team would be  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Serge Ibaka  ___  while the NY team would be  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julius Randle  C: Mitchell Robinson"
"KG's offensive game was more diverse. Doesn't mean it was better. He was a much better ball handler, a better passer and incorporated more face up to his game Duncan ever did. It's like saying Carmelo has a more diverse offensive game than Kawhi Leonard. He does. Doesn't mean it was more effective especially in the playoffs."

"These stats on their own don‚Äôt say much without [watching the shots so here we go](https://go.nba.com/4ynm)  3 7:18 off the offensive board LaVine does a solid job staying in Lukas hip space. Luka also kind of looks gased already and settles here a little   3 4:18 LaVine is fine but the help defense here really makes the play that combined with it being a tough angle for the skip pass in the corner to James Johnson who isn‚Äôt exactly Karl Anthony towns from 3 is part of why there is no pass   3 3:38: stays in his hip probably the best defensive clip yet although again Luka kinda pre determined 7 left on the clock he was taking the step back. Still this is solid work   4 5:00 open spot up off a give and go not much to see here   4 2:22 this is pretty uninspired defense but it‚Äôs also near the end of a 17 point game so not really gonna care too much   He did his job billy talked about limiting his hip space in that video, LaVine has always been better on ball than off ball he was guarding Kawhi Leonard last week that didn‚Äôt go as well did better here. I do think Luka being just exhausted played a big part of all this"
calm down lmaoooo.   players have stretches where they‚Äôre better than each other in the regular season.   this doesn‚Äôt mean paul george is better than top 5 player and 2 time fmvp kawhi leonard.
"He's 1st in the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100).  His defensive rating is [102](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747) which is better than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embid, aka literally every other player except Rudy Gobert listed on Op's all-defense teams.  &gt;He's actually not in the top 20 for DBPM  Wrong he is 17th. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html"
"For real. I watched AD make Jimmy Butler scared to shoot layups in the finals and guard Kawhi leonard this year.   Even if Jokic is better offensively, it isn't by a giant chasm. Ad would be putting up an efficient 27-30ppg as a number 1 option and is a pretty good passer in is own right with dpoy defense.   People act like he just didn't take a dump on the Nuggets and out play Jokic in a playoff series too"
"Agree up to a point. Think for instance Kawhi Leonard. He was an immense talent. Would he be as good as he is today, had Pop played him like a starter/star from the beginning? Very likely that the years developing good habits behind the Spurs big 3 made him who he is today"
"Who can say for certain who will win the next few championships. What we do know is that the league is going through a lot of very unique events in a very short amount of time. COVID has forced the league to radically change how they operate - sometimes for the worse, but sometimes for the better. What changes might stick around beyond COVID?  It has been widely speculated that the 2022 draft will be a double draft as the age restriction lowers from 19 to 18, which will presumably create a doubly talented draft class. This draft class will also contain a lot of people who grew up and became basketball players entirely during the 3-pt era. It's possible that we see numbers start to trend upwards league-wide from behind the 3pt line.  Somewhere in the next few years the CBA will be renegotiated. With big stars like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and more demanding trades and making them happen, owners may want the new agreement to help keep stars in one place.   Not to mention Space Jam: A New Legacy coming out this summer. ^(/s)  By the time LeBron retires, the league will be completely different."
"Top 10 NBA players  (in order).   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokiƒá.  The Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the NBA."
"uhh yes? most sports network reported the lakers as his preferred destination. find me an article where a major sports sports network/channel had the clippers as his preferred team.  here are some betting odds on lebron's free agency decision:  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-free-agency-odds-lakers-favorites-for-lebron-celtics-76ers-for-kawhi-leonard/#:~:text=Outside%20of%20the%20Lakers%2C%20the,odds%20%2D%2D%20according%20to%20BetDSI.  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/06/lebron-james-free-agency-betting-odds-next-team  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/06/22/lebron-james-free-agency-odds-lakers-cavs-rockets  as you can see lakers were the favourites to land lebron and the clippers werent even in conversation even though they were the better team at the time"
"I hate that saying. It‚Äôs clearly not true. Kawhi Leonard is still the best player on the Clippers, even when he‚Äôs load managing.   KD and Steph obviously had better seasons than LeBron in 2018-19, but they weren‚Äôt better players."
Tacko Fall and Marcus Smart.   LeBron James and Alex Caruso.   Kawhi Leonard and literally any teammate

"You keep making claims but haven‚Äôt given a single reason why you believe in your opinion. Bigger/longer hands make it harder to release the ball with the right consistency. Its harder for the ball to roll of your hands the right way. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs shot a basketball a lot, you‚Äôd know how important finger/fingertips are important to the feel of a shot. If you have to practically cuff a basketball to make sure the ball doesn‚Äôt move inconsistently across your fingers, that‚Äôs gonna affect your touch and make it harder to shoot. If that‚Äôs hard for you to imagine, let me break it down as if you‚Äôre 8 years old. Imagine trying to shoot a golf ball into a tiny net just big enough to fit golf balls, or a tennis ball in a tennis ball sized net. You‚Äôd be practically cuffing the ball or actually holding it with your fingers to shoot. Now imagine trying to shoot a huge yoga ball into a yoga ball sized net. You wouldn‚Äôt be cuffing the yoga ball, and it‚Äôd be easier to feel the touch on the ball.  And if you still want to argue with me just because you feel like it and don‚Äôt want to add reasoning, how about this [quote from Kawhi Leonard himself](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/kawhi-leonard-hands-so-big-trouble-shooting-2019-5%3Famp) who so many people use as an example of good shooting with big hands  ‚ÄúIt's just kinda difficult shooting sometimes,"" Leonard said. ""It's just difficult. A lot of hard work. You know, sometimes, like, if you shoot a girl's basketball, it's smaller, it's hard to shoot it, hard to roll off your hands.

Kawhi Leonard and Tracy McGrady
hot take kawhi leonard a super star
"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"I get not being comfortable pronouncing it because its an intimidating name, but at that point just call him Giannis if you're just a fan. If you're a professional basketball person though know how to say the man's name. Its the same as not pronouncing any professional jargon. If you pronounce some of it wrong I'm gonna think you don't know what you're talking about. That and Giannis' name is fun to pronounce it has a very sing-songy quality to it. Like Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Russel Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard,  etc"
‚ÄúTHANK YOU‚Äù - Kawhi Leonard
I remember when Kawhi Leonard was a rookie and charles Barkley called him kwame leonard. Like kwame brown.
"Stopped by Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Bam Adabayo, and Jae Crowder vs stopped by Jeff Green and Deandre Jordan"
Hotter take: unless you‚Äôre Kawhi Leonard they‚Äôre not actually violating their contracts. AD and Harden still played every game they could‚Äôve played in.
It‚Äôs almost like the Kawhi Leonard ‚ÄúApple Time‚Äù story.
"Well that's just you being disingenuous IMO, his team was at a massive talent disadvantage, and the only reason they had a chance in that series was because of Harden, he was the only shot creator on that team once CP3 went down, and the other 2 team had 2 MVPs, and another 20+ PPG scorer in Klay, arguably the best 3rd option of all-time (well until now with this Nets team...).   Harden is just a worse version of LeBron. LeBron always lost to better teams, until he stacked the deck and made the best team and won championships. Even the Finals he's lost in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, he gets a pass for because again, he lost to better teams and nobody rightfully holds that against them because there's an acknowledgement of the talent disadvantage he was at.   KD lost to better teams in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016, until he stacked the deck in his favor and won championships.  You say LeBron took GS without Kyrie and Love to 6, and yeah, he did, but he didn't actually win that series and he was horribly inefficient. Does anybody *blame* him for that? No. Nobody sane does.   Harden took the 2019 Warriors to 6 with a decrepit Chris Paul who was useless for the first 5 games of that series, and yet somehow he gets blame for that? That series was INSANELY close, 2-2 after the first 4 games, with none of the games in that series being decided by more than 6 points. If you want to argue that he could've done better once KD went out, sure, but if anything that proves what every sane basketball fan believes, which is that Steph Curry &gt; James Harden. Klay Thompson was also a better #2 option than CP3 was at that time given his injuries, so again, he was at a talent disadvantage.   Point is, that Harden has never lost to any team where he was the favorite, where he had the better team. Now, you can argue that's what makes you a truly great player in this league.   However, has Kevin Durant done that before? Has Kawhi Leonard done that before?  Hell, has LeBron done that before?   It's really, really fucking hard to win a championship, which is why these superstars just stack the deck in their favor to try and increase the odds. The NBA has never been more like Game of Thrones than it is right now."
"was I wrong?  you are a textbook bandwagon fan. you're beginning to support another team because your guy now plays for them. That's what LeBron fans do, and nobody takes them seriously.  my favorite player was Kawhi Leonard, and I was probably his biggest dickrider of all time. I got to see him get drafted, develop as a player over watching hundreds of games, win Finals MVP and back-to-back DPOYs - but I'm not about to start rooting for the fucking Clippers. Fuck that dude.  How can you continue to support a guy that forced his way out of 'your team', while players that are still playing for 'your team' are calling him out on his shit?  I literally watched James Harden completely give up against the Spurs in 2017. dude accomplished nothing for the Rockets, unless you want to call a regular season MVP and shitting the bed in numerous playoff series an 'accomplishment'. at least Kawhi contributed to our 2014 championship.  and lmao you have a Nets flair on but are speaking as if you're a Rockets fan. how can you not see what's wrong with that? People are gonna be confused.  John Wall plays for your team now, and he's a great player and an awesome person. How about sticking to backing that guy?  and you can still like James Harden. You do you. but that doesn't mean you need to become a Nets supporter."
What a casual. Kawhi would have drank both bottles with one hand.  Reference: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/01/clippers-kawhi-leonard-giant-hands-photos-water-bottles
#Fuck Kawhi Leonard
"Sure, but If you put any of those guys next to Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam and they are going up against an injured Warriors team, they likely win a title too. Lowry winning a title as a 2nd or 3rd option moves the needle a bit, but it shouldn't make up for his only 1 all NBA selection, and 0 all defense selections.   If Kawhi doesn't go to Toronto, Lowry likely ends up with no championship. That being said, I'm pretty sure he'll get into the HOF because they have the lowest entry bar out of any of the major 5 sports' halls."

I don't want no one saying Kawhi Leonard and Lebron James in the same sentence... The same paragraph... The same essay... Unless trash comes after Kawhis name

Terrence Ross&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kawhi Leonard
Kobe Bryant 0 games played. Eli Manning 0 games played.  Other successful trade demands: Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Kyrie Irving  You can go to whichever team you want after your rookie deal. Play two years for Charlotte and go to the team of your choice you whiny bitch.
"kawhi's shot wasn't to tie, it was to win. if he missed you had a CHANCE, but embiid has no endurance, and ben wasn't going to save you, you were going down in OT. this is such a trash narrative.  &gt;literally a crazy bounce on a Leonard shot from going to the finals  and the bucks would've handled philly as well imo.  do philly fans really think if kawhi missed they are automatically in the finals? this keep dreaming bud"
I‚Äôm not doubting that he‚Äôs a very good player and was pivotal in that raptors teams success but their superstar was kawhi Leonard and fvv and Siakam were also great
The deal also included Kawhi Leonard...
"yeeeeeah this is a pretty dumb take imo (ignore flair for now)  When was the last time a team won a championship on the back of a player they traded for that aren't named Kawhi Leonard?   A decade an a half ago with the '06 Heat, despite Wade being an integral part of that run. Before that.....??? Probably the Lakers when they traded for KAJ in the 70s (or when they traded for Wilt in the 60s)?"
"the Spurs have always been an incredible defensive team. You're talking about a team starting Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan (albeit aging) as bad defensively?"
Kawhi Leonard sat out an entire season because he thought the spurs incorrectly diagnosed his injury. He then ghosted the entire organization and intentionally tanked his trade value.   Btw they diagnosed him with the right injury which was knee tendinitis........
"Harden is going to the Knicks in exchange for Barrett, Toppin, Randle, and lots of picks.  The Knicks are good with this because they are convinced Kawhi Leonard will also sign in free agency this summer. He will not. Then the Knicks will max John Collins. The Rockets are good with this because the Knicks picks will be way better than the picks they would have gotten from Brooklyn or Philly.  and there they will be. James Harden, John Collins, and a bunch of scrubs. Your New York Knicks."
"I think it's real close but yeah thinking about it more I might lean this way. Thing is the perimeter/wing defense if there's no PJ involved becomes pretty shaky now if this deal happens. Obviously you still do this deal but its an issue.  Ultimately though I dont think I can trust Tisse to really play 25 min a night in the playoffs this year yet and if that's the case it's just hard to justify giving up Maxey.   If the cost of getting PJ Tucker though was having to give up Maxey over Thybulle I would do it. Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard......that roster just really needs a true wing defender to win a title."
On the opposite end is Kawhi Leonard who didn‚Äôt explicitly say anything and is also a major asshole
"A lot of Spurs fans will overestimate the likelihood at which players will reach their theoretical ceilings but don‚Äôt go the opposite direction in precluding any young player from reaching their ceiling; even placing a ceiling on any teams‚Äô young players.  After the 2014 finals a common perception around Kawhi was his ceiling was a better shooting Shawn Marion (which is an all star player to be fair) and I‚Äôm sure we all remember the famous thread everyone thought Spurs fans were dumb to pick Kawhi over Wiggins around that same time. Sure, some Spurs fans will treat every young player like they will develop at the same pace as Kawhi did, which is foolish, but I think so is discounting the idea of any team‚Äôs young player from improving beyond their perceived ceiling.   Kawhi is a much better player now than even I thought his ceiling was from 2012-15 when he was already being billed as a future star player by all his teammates coaches and fans. Again, it would be foolish to expect any one or all of the Spurs current young players to overachieve beyond their perceived ceiling but it shouldn‚Äôt be precluded so adamantly. Nor any teams‚Äô young players. That‚Äôs much less interesting a stance than something more resolute, like a player will or won‚Äôt be a star or average rotation player.  I don‚Äôt take the OP of this post seriously on account of some of his erratic and combative postings over the years, but realize with any over-estimative thoughts on the Spurs young players, they‚Äôre made after the conversation around a ‚ÄúSpurs young core‚Äù the last 2 year‚Äôs has largely been met by other teams‚Äô fans with ‚Äúwhat young core? That‚Äôs a bunch of future role players.‚Äù Which, while shouldn‚Äôt be the expectation this time around, was the same answer given to Spurs fans about the Cojo/Green/Leonard/Splitter core from 2012-14. Which did end up mostly as role players. I‚Äôll give those past pundits that. Patty not included as he didn‚Äôt really start to play until 13-14 wherein Green and Leonard had started to push the needle back in non-Spurs fan circles as being more than just ‚Äúfuture role players.‚Äù"
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
I think he matters because they will need a bigger wing to throw on Kevin Durant Jayson Tatum Jimmy Butler and hell if they make it that far LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard. Danny green can‚Äôt do it anymore that‚Äôs the PJ duty  You want lineup flexibility. Tobias/Harden/Embiid....you don‚Äôt really need more offense around that. Want to compliment it with more wing defense if the possibility exists. I actually think the lineup I like most is Embiid/Tobias/PJ/Seth/Harden. PJ guards 4 positions doesn‚Äôt matter what you list Tobias as if you want him to guard 4s you can easily make that happen    Also Dwight looks good now but it‚Äôs no lock he‚Äôs gonna be reliable enough to hold up as a backup C after the first round. They lost a series to Toronto literally because they died without Embiid on the court PJ is a real backup 5 for 10-12 min a game you don‚Äôt have to worry about
Thats higher than Kawhi Leonard
https://www.google.com/amp/s/autos.yahoo.com/amphtml/kawhi-leonard-dunk-vs-san-053300710.html  I‚Äôm almost certain he‚Äôs had a couple dunks off of wide open fast breaks but I‚Äôm not going to dig around to find them
"What if Pachulia never commits the dirty play that injured Kawhi Leonard. Spurs were up 20 in game 1 of that series, imagine this series of dominoes: Kawhi &amp; the Spurs beat the warriors. Warriors dynasty is never born &amp; they don't win a single title, Kawhi never leaves the Spurs (at least for Toronto) so the Raptors never win, KD stays in OKC after making the finals in the West and then runs it back after losing to Lebron James' Cavs. Several more timelines and variations of this but it changes allllllll the playoff matchups in 2015 which were the impetus behind the movement of a lot of stars in the league for several years after."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"

"Well check this out...  My flair says: [SAS] Kawhi Leonard   Meaning, the Spurs is the team I root for, and I am a fan of Kawhi Leonard, aka he is a favorite player  You see, with a good comprehension, you would have understood that perfectly.   This is where the hypocrisy comes in. The NBA is probably the only sport league where you can have a favorite player that is not necessarily playing for your own team that your support. It‚Äôs a Player driven league and everyone understands that...well I guess not everyone.   Is it clear to you now?"
"The path to winning an NBA title *without* a player at James Harden's level is incredibly narrow. The 2004 Pistons are the only team in the last 40 years to win a title without one of the 20-30ish best players of all time as the #1 option. Every other champion in that span has had at least one of the following players leading the team: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Isaiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, or Moses Malone.  IMO, the risk of keeping Harden outweighs the risk you take by giving him up. I don't think there's a trade package out there that gets you a player with the potential to jump into that rarified level of talent that's required to win the title."
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."

"I love how THT looks. Gives me flashes of young Kawhi Leonard. Has bit of tunnel vision, but hes still very young and Getting better everyday"
"you, a reddit troll, called kawhi leonard a bum. bye"
"Right now it's kawhi leonard. He can barely walk nowadays, idk why clips gave him the bag. I really like the guy too"
Kawhi Leonard is screwed in this sense
"[Kawhi has the same hand size as Shaq but shoots 89% from FT line](https://www.businessinsider.com/kawhi-leonard-hands-so-big-trouble-shooting-2019-5#:~:text=Leonard%20did%20say%20that%20his,inches%20shorter%20than%20O'Neal.)"
Kawhi Leonard absolutely unstoppable this quarter
"Well supposedly [he told the Raptors he didn't want to re-sign with them because he didn't think they could win another championship,](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/17/report-kawhi-leonard-told-raptors-he-didnt-think-they-were-good-enough-to-repeat/) so I wonder if that'll matter for him with the Clippers or not. So again, do you think he'll just re-sign with no further demands, or do you think he'll use his leverage to try to get the Clippers to make changes first?"
"They have two stars, Paul George and kawhi Leonard. Last season, they led the nuggets 3-1 in a series. They literally had to win a single game and they would advance. Instead, both stars plus the entire team shit the bed and lost the series, while blowing leads in every game. Everyone makes fun of them."
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, and Kyrie Irving. Doesn't support your point."
"Kawhi ""LeBron ""Coach Killer"" James"" Leonard"
"&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to change it. We‚Äôve got to get better‚Ä¶‚Äù Kawhi Leonard said after the loss.  Oh good, sounds like he might be taking responsibility for how bad he played in the 4th.  &gt;‚ÄúOur third quarter was terrible as far as defense.   Damn it, he's singling out the stretch when he wasn't in the game."
Fuck Kawhi Leonard
K.L.A.W.  Kawhi Leonard Andrew Wiggins
I thought Josh Selby from Kansas was gonna be like Baron Davis 2.0 lol  &amp;#x200B;  I was also really high on Josh Jackson and Stanley Johnson becoming Kawhi Leonard-lites.
So basically Kawhi Leonard is overrated as is Paul George. And Ty Lue is a terrible head coach whose success was based on Lebron James being a top 2 player of all time
Probably the same you would‚Äôve explained how Andrew fucking Wiggins wasn‚Äôt going to have any kind of effect on Kawhi Leonard before today

So Kobe is a better defender than Tony Allen and Kawhi Leonard based on your logic

Kawhi Leonard and Boban Marjanovic
Kawhi Leonard aka the claw.
"Kawhi Leonard, Capetown original"
"He can and does quite regularly. Here‚Äôs a good article from last season  &gt; Anunoby's isolation stats are eye-popping. He ranks in the 94th percentile in isolation defense, according to NBA Advanced Stats, surrendering 0.61 pointer per possession in isolation. Of players who have played at least 48 games this year, Anunoby ranked 14th in isolation defense, immediately behind Kawhi Leonard. While being in the 94th percentile is impressive, it's Anunoby's versatility that makes him truly special in isolation. Of players with a minimum of 2000 possessions, Anunoby led the NBA this season in Versatility, a stat created by Krishna Narsu that attempts to measure how often a player defends different positions. He played 24% of his time defending small forwards, another 24% of his time on shooting guards, 22% of his time on power forwards, and 16 and 13 percent of his time defending point guards and centers, respectively.  [source](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/is-og-anunoby-the-best-isolation-defender-in-the-nba)  I‚Äôve seen Nurse assign him as a primary defender on both Damian Lillard and Bam Adebayo and made them both struggle. Dude is as versatile a defender as they come, one of the few players who can truly guard 1-5."

" &gt;Being a high level shot creator and exploiting that to create plays for your teammates is definitely playmaking.  Yeah but Kawhi doesn't directly create plays for others at the rate that other players do.  &gt;You think defenses respect ricky rubio more than Kawhi Leonard?  No? But your post is about playmaking, not overall best offensive player."
Being a high level shot creator and exploiting that to create plays for your teammates is definitely playmaking. You think defenses respect ricky rubio more than Kawhi Leonard?
"Kawhi Leonard averaged 31/9/4 on 62%TS over an entire postseason. He carried a team over an elite 76ers defense with Simmons, Embiid, and Butler. In the postseason, he has the handle, the midrange game, and the three point shot to stay consistent.  He's a career 40% 3 point shooter in the playoffs. Kawhi's free throw attempts in his past 3 playoffs have been 8.5, 9.0. and 7.2 attempts per game. His career True Shooting Percentage is actually higher in the playoffs.  Having a complete offensive game is so undervalued for star players. You need to be able to find multiple ways to score and put pressure on the defense and limit your mistakes. Kawhi does all of that to perfection. For such an elite playoff performer, I don't think its fair to give it to Trae Young, whose never played in the playoffs and has some holes and questions to the consistency of his offensive game."
kawhi leonard sweetie i am SO sorry
"eh i think a lot of the issue with luke is too many cooks in the kitchen and still trying to figure out his role. his biggest problem is being hesitant to shoot and he‚Äôs made some bad foul choices, but his defense isn‚Äôt bad and he‚Äôs gotten some pretty impressive steals lately. his confidence is growing and i have faith in him, i think it‚Äôs just hard for him to take a shot when he has paul george and kawhi leonard and like 4 other guys on the team shooting lights out from 3 also willing to take that shot."

"Kukoc that year: 10/4/3 on 43/27/74 Started 8 games.  Kerr: 9 points on 50/40/90 Started 0 games. Took 7 shots a game  Longley: played 27 games total that year.  Less than 20 minutes a game. Gave you 8/5/2 on 52% true shooting as a center.   The reason why getting gasol is a bad comparison is because gasol is worth more than the sum of these players' parts that first season.   They lost Horace Grant, Paxson, Scott Williams, and BJ Armstrong that year.  You might make fun of Scott Williams, but in 93-94 he and Luc Longley had nearly identical numbers, and you called Luc Longley a key piece in replacing michael jordan earlier, so hopefully you grant me Scott Williams  In regards to the mvp argument, if Paul george carried on his dpoy level team and individual defense on 1-4 while averaging his numbers on his insane efficiency that year, then we would call him Kawhi Leonard. The only reason he doesn't have an argument similar to kawhi leonard for a top 3 spot is because he couldn't keep it going. That's not the fault of the mvp award, that's the fault of Paul george. If he had the exact same season for ten seasons straight he'd be consensus 3rd.  The reason why Scottie Pippen's mvp voting fell off is bc the team was gutted and they couldn't win in the mid 50s. If he had just kept Horace Grant the team would've won much more.  No one will read this far in my comment so I can give the super hot take that if Zach lavine was a good on ball defender this year he'd be no different than michael jordan   When Michael came back he had a worse PER than Scottie while taking a million shots on 43% efg.  27 points on 43% efg is like Monte Ellis numbers. It was worse true shooting than the Luc Longley I made fun of earlier, with worse offensive win shares than either of his years on the wizards, and worse defensive win shares than either year on the wizards. **you could literally put Jordan from the 2000s after retiring twice on this team and they still probably go 13-4.  If not, the stats would suggest they would do better.  This is not a testament to michael jordan, it is a testament to how depleted the team was, that even a slightly above average scorer could break the ceiling.** You can follow the logic here and blame HORACE GRANT for scottie only ranking 7th in mvp voting that year.   Either way, you can't defend Michael by saying ""he saved the team that had neRly a .500 record and made them a strong playoff team!"" But also hide behind ""of course he'd get knocked out first round! He was rusty!!! It's not a fair comparison!!!!""  Either he was washed that year or he carried a sinking ship, but you can't have both."
"Kawhi lead the spurs to nearly a 70 win pace.  In his return they got a perennial all star.  They very narrowly made the playoffs.   It's not like this team was the kawhi iso show, especially not in the regular season which is what we're comparing.   Bonus fact: kawhi leonard scores better from 2%, 3%, and the free line, and in the playoffs for his career has a better ortg and drtg"

He prolly picked up on some stuff when he played Kawhi last week. Kawhi absolutely eviscerated him. Pat was always 1-2 steps behind and Leonard was perfect from midrange when Williams guarded him. Leonard cooked him. It was a welcome to the NBA moment.
"Who is out, just to have a full roster I'll include guards/center but he's a forward so only those matter  1st team - Curry/Lillard/LeBron/Giannis/Jokic  2nd team - Doncic/Beal/Leonard/Durant/Embiid  3rd team - Irving/Mitchell/Tatum/?/Gobert  He will need to beat everyone on this list; Sabonis, Harris, Hayward, Zion, Butler (plenty of games left for consideration now that he is back and playing well), Siakam  Assuming the Lakers rest Davis enough to hurt his chances which they absolutely should if he needs it. He's also a center too, but, ah, we'll ignore him here  LeBron + Giannis + KD should have no problem nabbing forward spots. Kawhi also has a strong team and plays very well so he should grab one easy too. I've got Tatum at third team since he's one of the pillars keeping the Celtics in the playoffs + he has high counting stats which gets votes + they are still as of now a high seed. Third team all nba is usually fun to guess though and we've got plenty of season left"
"I‚Äôm so OOTL, I know PG is out with toe issues but where the heck is Kawhi Leonard?"
the Warriors were a Kawhi Leonard injury away from losing more games too.
"&gt; Ty Lue's offensive system has the ball moving around a lot. Just about everyone besides PG and Kawhi take open (or wide open) 3s because of it which leads to a lot of them shooting 40%.   Morris is 132 points over his career 3FG%. George is 93 points over his. Batum is 96 points over his. Kennard is 35 points over his. Beverley is 53 points over his. Williams is 32 points over his.  Of their top-7 shooters, the only one near his career average is Leonard.  That's simply not sustainable, and not the effect of any system -- unless you consider empty arenas to be a 'system'.  None of those guys were chucking bad, contested threes throughout their careers, except maybe Williams."
kawhi leonard is the best raptor ever because they would not have a chip without him. simple.
"Look at the clutch playoff champions since 1990. Most have an elite midrange player that can create his own space. Jordan, kobe, pierce, durant, LeBron, kawhi etc. A decent size wing is always gonna be the  most important player in basketball . There is even a quote from kerr that goes:  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP¬†Kevin Durant¬†- not¬†Stephen Curry¬†- as the second-best player in the world behind¬†LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to¬†Kawhi Leonard¬†for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
Yeah but the Spurs were about to nuke them but they injured Kawhi Leonard. Does everyone forget the Spurs were up by like 25 when Kawhi was healthy?
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"1. About the Drummond situation, I don't think that Draymond has a problem with the Cavs not playing Drummond because he is on the trading block but rather how he was pulled from the bench and had to change attire, and continue to watch the game from the sidelines. If the organization wants him not to play, the proper way would be to inform the player before he arrives to the stadium to play to avoid the embarrassing situation that occured yesterday.   2. About Harrison Barnes being traded during a game and other players finding out from third-party or being straight-up lied to by GMs about where they stand with the team, players should be the first ones to find out if they have been traded so they can start preparing themselves and their FAMILIES without facing unwanted extra media attention. Furthermore, players should be informed if the team is entertaining trade offers for them so that they can mentally prepare themselves and their FAMILIES that they might have to relocate.  3. Thirdly, if the teams can publicly announce that they are going to trade a player, why can't a player publicly demand a trade? The team doesn't have to trade them if they don't want to. It's not like teams never leak information on players to the media without informing them.  4. If a player is going to be traded, and is not going to play why should he have to attend the games? What sense does it make for him to attend the games if he will inevitably be traded?  5. There is a reason trash teams remain trash. If Draymond was drafted by almost in any other team by the warriors, he would probably be out of the league right now. While young players like Markelle Fultz in Philadelphia, Lonzo Ball on the Lakers were constantly ridiculed for not living upto their potential; organizations such as the Portland Trailblazers never receive any backclash for ruining the career of a promising talent like Greg Oden by using experimental medical techniques; the San Antonio Spurs medical staff giving Kawhi Leonard the green light to play even with his constant protests, and later it was found out that he had several problems such as hematoma, tendinopathy, etc.  Finally, the NBA cannot be analysed in isolation of fans and media as they all exist in a nexus."

"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
you guys didn't suddenly get Kawhi Leonard at FA though
"FMVP could have surely gone to either Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, or Timmy. Manu if we really stretch it.   I don't mind Kawhi winning FMVP, but this revisionist ""Oh he carried the Spurs, his fans should be happy"" narrative needs to stop. Our 2014 is the very definition of pure team basketball."
"Part of that is because Kawhi Leonard is primarily known for his defense, LeBron James was easily positioned to be the face of the league the moment he graduated high school, Kawhi Leonard did not even become a truly great player in my opinion until the 20 15/16 season, even when he won the 2014 finals MVP that was such a team effort ass-kicking that it just felt like "" alright let's give it to the young guy"". Another reason is by this eras standards the 2019 Toronto Raptors were a historically great defensive team, and he was the best player on it so that carries over as well so reputation and perception is a huge part. And LeBron bear a lot of responsibility in that as well because there was a few years stretch after he left Miami that he wasn't exactly putting up the best efforts on defense like he had been"
"Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan, Kawhi Leonard"
"Gary Payton, Jimmy butler, Kawhi leonard, scottie pippen, giannis  all coached by thibbs"
I think we're forgetting about Kawhi Leonard he was not a particularly good offensive player when he came into the league and definitely not a great shooter and he turned into a legitimate MVP caliber player

"I‚Äôm not sure what to tell you. Mitchell outperformed Kawhi in the playoffs last season. Donovan Mitchell averaged 36.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 4.9 assists. Do you want me to repeat that? *36.3* points. (Keep in mind that Donovan is 6‚Äô 1‚Äù and has Gobert: he doesn‚Äôt need to rebound.) Kawhi Leonard averaged 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 5.5 assists.   Is Donovan Mitchell a better player than Kawhi? No. Is he capable of playing like a superstar in the playoffs? Yes. He has and there‚Äôs no reason to think he couldn‚Äôt continue to."

Kawhi Leonard over John Stockton....

"I've long held that Toronto is by far the biggest ""small market"" in the NBA. We're in another country, so despite how absolutely massive metro Toronto (~6.4M) and the greater Golden Horseshoe (~8-9M depending on how it's defined) are, and therefore the sheer amount of stuff there is for rich people to do there, we just don't sign marquee FAs. Ever. It took a massive gamble on a one-year rental of Kawhi fucking Leonard (which paid off massively) for us to win a ring.  Aside from that, despite how obnoxious my fellow Raps fans can be about it, there *is* an element of truth to the idea that American sports media are generally indifferent to the team, and that's that Canadian broadcasts, despite drawing millions of viewers (especially during our 2019 championship run) don't factor in to *American* TV ratings. They generally don't care much about the Raptors because the team doesn't really matter much to big, deep-pocketed American TV advertisers.  As a result, I think there's a fair bit of (sometimes warranted--we lost three of the five championship starters to Los Angeles *alone* over the last two offseasons) animosity towards bigger, more desirable American markets. It's already hard for us to keep our own role players at times."

"He gets a lot less overall love cuz the Kawhi mania from last season ended in a chokejob. He‚Äôs clearly still among the best players and he‚Äôs been having a terrific season so far. Unfortunately because of that choke, Steph and KD returning and playing really well, Embiid balling the hell out, and Bron playing very well after winning the chip, he‚Äôs just not getting as much hype even tho he‚Äôs playing as well as those guys.  I‚Äôve said it before but along with Bron and Brodie, Mr. Leonard is one of my three favorite active players"

"It's exactly because he bought the team to feed his ego that he wouldn't even entertain the idea of moving the franchise to Seattle. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George just forced a move there with the latter already signed to a 5 year extension. Do you see that happening in Seattle? Salary cap in North American sports make being a super rich owner in an unpopular player destination pretty much worthless. He wants to win titles, and there's a way bigger likelihood of that happening in LA."

Sign Kawhi Leonard in the offseason
"Everyone says he carried the team, even actual NBA players!  Even the link I provided just for you proves that.  The other point I made was that you seem to be the only one who disagrees with the obvious.  AI played ball. He had his own style. Yet here you are, gatekeeping his style (which earned him MVP!!) and denigrating it with a smear attack. If he played any other way, it wouldn‚Äôt be his style. If he played any other way, it wouldn‚Äôt earn him MVP.   That‚Äôs not hero-ball. That‚Äôs AI style. People mimicked that style. Ergo, Kawhi Leonard.  Also, AI played great defense! He is 14th in All-Time steals!  Yet I read nothing about his contributions to that side of the ball... just an omission in order to detract those efforts and highlight that other players played defense, and he was the offense, and that‚Äôs why they won games.  **THAT, IS DISRESPECTFUL!**"
Without Jordan the Bulls are ringless.   Without Dwyane Wade the Heat are ringless.   Without Kawhi Leonard the Raptors are ringless.   Without Dirk Nowitzki the Mavericks are ringless.  Without Tim Duncan the Spurs are ringless.  Woah. It‚Äôs almost like superstars help their teams win championships. What a stupid fucking rebuttal
"The point system is bad, like you need Kawhi + one of Siakam/Zion/Towns just to be as likely to win a title as a team with Giannis or Anthont Davis? I would argue having Kawhi is more valuable to winning a title than either of these two.  Similarly switching Kawhi Leonard for Damian Lillard changes almost nothing in your ranking, but i think that swapping Kawhi for Lillard hurts the Clippers title odds drastically.  Basically Kawhi for -200 is insane compared to the -250s, and for what you can get for Kawhi plus 100 points is probably better than lebron, ie.  Kawhi/Siakam/Towns vs Just Lebron"
"Even though it only lasted one season, I would add Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, and Pascal Siakam to this list."
"No team gets to the finals by 1 player alone. However, plenty of teams get there by the excellent play of 1 individual.  The term ‚Äúcarried‚Äù is a clear, well-known vernacular for performances in sports just as AI did.  You hold a minority opinion for sure. So it doesn‚Äôt make it a rewrite to the sports writers of America, nor to the other players of the teams he trampled along the way that year. They themselves would attest to this word!  I‚Äôm sorry but your appeal isn‚Äôt enough to change the hearts and minds of (essentially everyone but you) on this. Further, your protest of the usage of the word doesn‚Äôt make this a debate enough to contest the idea that he did in fact carry that team!  Out of 10,000 viewpoints, nearly all would use this terminology, **except you**.   At some point, a dissenting opinion is simply non-factual and without merit.  I‚Äôd go far as to say AI himself aimed to carry that team.   But don‚Äôt take my word for it (much love, LeVar)...

BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them.

This year he started great for 4 games, got covid, and took a while to really get going, and has been lights out since.   I guess I would say he has more just been slowly rising with the growing pains of a young player.   His ceiling? With that shooting and scoring efficiency? And considering he's just starting to develop a handle and his defense is starting to come into form? I think his *ceiling* is top 10 player in the league. His likely landing spot is definite all star"
"This is an interesting stat but it‚Äôs worth noting that some of the teams with super inflated all star appearances came with washed up former super stars chasing a ring.   The nets main trio are all as good as ever. Griffin and Aldridge not so much.  The Lakers team is the only one where it‚Äôs a bit crazy that they came up short for the simple fact they had Kobe and Shaq still in their prime. Every previous all star selection on those Celtics squads noted were really on their last legs and the heat team had a declining bosh, an over the hill Ray Allen counting for some of those all star appearances going off against one of the best coaches in history and an ascending Kawhi Leonard.  This nets team probably resembles that 03 Lakers squad the most but they did at least manage a finals appearance. I think these nets are a bit more dangerous though as Kobe was the only pure scoring assassin on that Lakers squad and this nets team has 3 of those types"

"Defense in basketball is difficult to quantify because the best defense is usually marked by an absence of anything happening. Great defenders, particularly wings and guards don't block shots or steal passes, they stop their man from ever taking a shot or even getting passed to. This is difficult to analyze and can lead to strange situations like when [Kawhi Leonard was so good at 1 on 1 defense that he made the Spurs' defensive rating worse](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs)."
"PG: Kyle Lowry - Obvious choice, greatest raptor of all time.  SG: Vince Carter - The OG franchise player, contributed to making the raptors good for the first time.  SF: Kawhi Leonard - Led the team to its first and only championship.  PF: DeMar DeRozan - Was the franchise player for years before the championship. He represents one of the best stretches of raptors basketball.  C: Chris Bosh - Was the franchise player after Carter."
"The years without Bowen Robinson and Kawhi were the worst seasons of Duncan‚Äôs career and more importantly the worst defensive rosters beside him for his career. Danny Green also played less than 100 minutes in 09-10 so his inclusion is also misleading.  Duncan‚Äôs defensive prime from 02-07 also featured one of the best perimeter defenders of all time in Bowen. The same was true with his 98-01 years with one of the best defensive players of all time and his late prime years of 12-15. I mean this sincerely but your context is shorted and intentionally fit to a narrative to wash away so much of 02-07 because of Bowen‚Äôs presence on the team. Most misleading from 02-07 as they were seasons Duncan was in argument for the best defensive player in the league every season. Even still, in his late career resurgence (12-15) and early years (98-01) he was one of the best and one of the very few best defenders in the league respectively. Your point would be better made on this seasons when Duncan was not obviously the best defender on his team. 98-01 Robinson was still one off the best defensive players in NBA history and Kawhi from 12-15 seriously challenged Duncan for best defender on the team if Kawhi wasn‚Äôt straight up the best defender on the team those latter few years.  If I was explaining to my 6 year old niece that the years without Robinson Bowen and Leonard the Spurs still had Duncan but didn‚Äôt vie for the best defense in the NBA, I could see why she should at first think those seasons were more indicative of Duncan‚Äôs defensive value. That wouldn‚Äôt be acknowledging the Spurs had the worst defensive rosters of Duncan‚Äôs career; even ignoring Duncan‚Äôs place on the team. Duncan himself was in the midst of his worst defensive years in which he still hadn‚Äôt cut the weight he eventually did to re-gain mobility at the expense of the weight he used to enjoy using to displace guys on offense and root himself to the ground defensively.   Robinson and Leonard did not anchor #1 defenses outside of their prime. Duncan was given the chance to anchor a defense without one of the best defensive players ever during his worst years with his weakest defensive rosters and produced top 10 defenses rather than anything challenging for best in the league. Kawhi still had an elite defensive roster in 2017 even if he didn‚Äôt have someone quite at Duncan and Robinson‚Äôs level. Danny Green in 2017 was still closer to 02-07 Bowen than Bowen was to Duncan or Robinson in their defensive prime.  Just because Duncan‚Äôs defensive prime came with Bowen is not reason to think his years without any of Bowen Robinson and Leonard were more indicative of his play than his seasons with one of them. Duncan never touched his prime defensive impact after 2007.  Anyone watching the NBA can acknowledge Duncan played with some of the best defensive players and rosters of all time and it boosted the team‚Äôs defensive efficiency. Overemphasizing the team‚Äôs results outside of Duncan‚Äôs prime, and with the worst defensive roster of his careers. is not more indicative of his value than looking at his actual defensive prime.  Nor is it fitting to compare him to guys who anchored #1 defenses in their **prime** like Robinson and Leonard. Leonard still had one of the best defensive rosters in the league around him after Duncan retired (Tim was washed in the 2016 calendar year) and was in his prime. Robinson is one of a few guys who may be better defenders than Duncan all time and anchored a #1 defense in his mid 20‚Äôs. Duncan‚Äôs prime defensive years and ones to focus on his impact are 02-07 and Bowen‚Äôs inclusion on those teams should not seriously distort your view of Duncan‚Äôs impact nor lead you to believe looking at his post-prime years, the worst of his career and worst defensive supporting casts of his career, is more indicative of his value. Context can of course be applied that in Duncan‚Äôs prime he played with one of the best defensive players ever (98-01) and then one of the best perimeter defenders of all time (02-07) but you supplied much more misleading context than that alone."

"They want stars in major markets. This entire league is run by nothing but greedy money-grubbing douchelords who would really rather just see New York vs LA every night if the ratings were high and the precious international market dgaf about the middle of the country  Notice how nobody was trying to push anyone towards Cleveland when we were the champs, it was all about where they should put LeBron next. They couldn‚Äôt get KD and Harden out of Oklahoma and into Houston or San Fran fast enough, and basically told Blake Griffin to shut it down so they could put him in NYC. Who was the last superstar Free Agent to sign in San Antonio? They were a DYNASTY and every single star they had from David Robinson to Kawhi Leonard was drafted. How about Dallas? OKC? For a team like Denver, Utah, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Portland, etc to be successful they either to hit in the draft or just get really lucky with putting together the right mix of guys nobody else wanted...and hit in the draft. Look at the last champions who did it through FA, LA, Miami, Boston, San Fran in the KD years (Cleveland runs riot without him there), LA again in the Shaq and Kobe era not to mention guys like Dwight Howard, and Ron ‚ÄúMeta World Peace‚Äù Artest. I guarantee if they took away profit sharing, we would find out some real shady shit from the smaller market guys. Keep owners paid, and they are happy. The draft lottery is rigged as hush money as well. Bet"
"I‚Äôve listed a few here. Thought the George Hill for Kawhi Leonard trade was a mistake at the time, didn‚Äôt think Kawhi would be as good as Hill lol  Thought we should‚Äôve grabbed Fultz on draft night.

"I've heard from some pundits his athleticism is waning, I can't tell though.    Kawhi has always been a pretty deliberate player and his athleticism is more about balance, footwork and strength than explosiveness.  I admit that he's not the defensive monster he was a couple years ago but he may just be saving a little something extra for the postseason.  Leonard may have lost a step but i'm not there yet with the Board Man."

"Kawhi Leonard left, other also guys left, they got COVID."
"I mean its not the worst take. Most people have kd ranked higher tho. been elite for longer. More accomplishments- and was considered the go to guy when both were together. Its hard for curry to be as good just because of his size. Late playoff games are decided by iso ball. the game slows down plays break down and the only place to create space is the midrange. last 4 championships have been decided by midrange iso players. kawhi kd kd and lbj/davis. its harder to create space when you are small as you cant shoot over players. Also lebron stated that kd was his nemesis. Kerr stated that lbj kd and kawhi were better than curry in those years too. A two way wing is always gonna have more impact than a small pg. here are his words. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr isn't playing favorites, but he also isn't shy about naming the best player on his stacked title squad. Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
"Some people do like cheering for their team even if they never won a championship, such as my friends who root for the Minnesota Vikings. The problem is that they keep doing that because the Vikings have great moments that keep them having hope that they will win a championship. Recently, In the NBA, half of the teams and their fans have zero chance to win a championship because the teams are considered ‚Äúsmall market‚Äù and the cities are viewed as second class compared to LA and New York. Charlotte, New Orleans, OKC, Phoenix, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee will never win a ship, even if they do have good players, because the all stars want to play in the giant ass cities of LA and New York. Toronto got lucky but even Kawhi Leonard would rather play on a mediocre team in LA than to be hailed as a king in Toronto"
They can still build around Kawhi with the pieces they get from a PG trade. I don‚Äôt think that Leonard and George are even a typical fit. Most people were just banking on the fact that they were two superstars and that itself would outweigh the clear disparity when it comes to fit.   I do like Paul George as a player though. I really do.
I was referencing Kawhi Leonard asking to go to LA

"Lol as if LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard wouldn't have also put up monster numbers. Each of those guys have had playoff runs putting up somewhat comparable numbers to Durant with the Warriors without the benefit of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the team.

"&gt;Do GMs really have to purposely underplay their hand and selectively not win trades too much to not alienate their peers ?  Spurs traded Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and the Raptors‚Äô 2018 1st round pick"
yup this.  once he was in the league it became clear it was more than just a jumper though. His handles were pretty bad too. He had basically everything else but those were critical flaws he just couldn't get past. A better organization would have got him more respectable on those fronts. At one point he was a better prospect than Kawhi Leonard. I often wonder how different things might've turned out if MKG was drafted by the Spurs or something.
"Nah, it took Kawhi Leonard 6 games  The Celtics weren‚Äôt beating Steph Curry"
"Kobe had great talent that played with him in Shaq and Gasol. But so did Duncan. Duncan never had a year where he didnt have HOF talent around him, with players like David Robinson, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobli, and Kawhi Leonard. Despite that Kobe and the Lakers beat Duncan's Spurs more head on and were more dominant."
"I'm not surprised at all oh, I think he just barely cracked the 10,000 point Mark recently, I know he has two finals MVPs but you have to look at his career as a whole Kawhi Leonard did not get into the conversation of being a great player overall until the 2015/16 season before that he was some guy the Spurs drafted out of San Diego State who gained a reputation as a defensive specialist and won his first Finals MVP because it was such a team-oriented ass whooping that they decided to give it to the young guy who was guarding LeBron, I would have given that one to Duncan myself but it's whatever.         And even then as efficient and great as he has become, when you look at all the load management and missed games, he's just not the type that's going to explode for that, I'd be surprised if he ever has a 60 point game to be honest with you"
"You really think Eddie Jones, McGrady,  Penny or Vince Carter could have been in Kobe's role?  That's laughable.  Without Kobe, Shaq doesnt get past teams like the Kings, Blazers, and the Spurs.  Shaq wasn't even the biggest factor in 05 because Prime Wade was the third best SG.  Of course Kobe needed Gasol. You don't win without HOF talent. Duncan in comparison for his whole career was surrounded by HOF talent, David Robinson, Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker, and Kawhi Leonard."
Kawhi Leonard also scored 0 points in 4th quarter of Game 2 of the 2020 Western Conference Semifinals against the Denver Nuggets.
Kawhi Leonard.
They have Kawhi Leonard who has proven he can lead a team to a championship
Clippers have Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It is a superstar league always has been.
"Because he brought in every single piece on that team lol. What more could a gm possibly do? He found Siakam, OG, FVV, Powell and Jonas. He traded Demar (who he also found) for Kawhi Leonard. He traded JV for Marc Gasol. He traded for Serge Ibaka. He got Kyle Lowry before he hit his prime.  That roster was probably the least lucky roster in the last 10 years to win a championship. They didn't get their guys through free agency or have lottery luck, hell none of those guys were even top picks."
And how much has Lowry done the years that Kawhi Leonard wasn‚Äôt there? Second round exits mostly instead of first round like in Russ‚Äôs case.
"I'm not sure if I consider 2014 a choke.  It's 2012 vs Miami but he was a 6th man  And 2017 vs the Spurs when Kawhi Leonard was injured.  He was also dangerously close in 2015 vs the Clippers and last year vs OKC, but he won those so cant hold it against him"

"LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Luka Doncic, maybe Nikola Jokic"
&gt;	they openly wanted Kawhi Leonard  That tweet was awesome:  Breaking news: Kawhi Leonard to Lakers is officially done. Both sides working on minor details at the moment before announcing deal.
"Lakers fans crying about super teams when they openly wanted Kawhi Leonard to form a big 3 with LeBron and AD. Not to mention Lakers were in the running for Griffin and Aldridge and they chose Nets. If they chose Lakers, half this sub would be like ""thats why Lebron is the goat."
"They definitely might be the greatest Redemption team of all time, considering the Heartbreak from the year prior I think all of us kind of became Spurs fans for a Split Second lol, but they're not some Pantheon great team they got taken 7 Games in first round, and they won 62 games, we seen better regular season teams, I remember Tony Parker made 2nd or 3rd team all NBA, that's cool and Kawhi Leonard made second-team all-defense , very nice they had a nice balance of offense and they did play beautiful basketball, and of course they got their revenge in dominating fashion. Thinking about it I'm not sure they'd be in my top 20 though"
"Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry"
i think the 2013 Spurs are contenders for that  Tony Parker  Manu Ginobili  Tim Duncan  Danny Green  Stephen Jackson  Boris Diaw  Kawhi Leonard  Tracy McGrady
"Lol no  Colluded with Bosh &amp; Wade to create a Superteam in Miami. ""Not 1, Not 2, Not 3, Not 4...."". Unfortunately Wade's knees gave out &amp; he left because he knew their time had ran out.  Tried to build another Superteam with Love &amp; Kyrie in Cleveland. Except it turned out Kevin Love wasn't anywhere near as good as he thought he was. Moved to LA after Kyrie's departure.  Attempted to build his 3rd Superteam with AD &amp; Kawhi in LA except Leonard controversially decided to join the Clippers instead.  LeBron laid the foundations for team hopping and creating superteams, KD just did it better."
Sixers/Clippers is a defensive beast. Simmons-Curry-George-Leonard-Embiid. Or swap out Curry and move PG and Kawhi up to insert Harris for some crazy offensive firepower.
"thats what all these dummies are missing  if you lost to Kawhi Leonard with a better roster than you have now, how the fuck you beating KD harden and kyrie in the playoffs. literally proven 1 dimensional team that got gentleman swept by the heat last year.   The bucks have 0 chance of winning the championship"

You also got Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green in their primes for DeRozan and Poetl...   That kind of shift in value makes it much easier to spend assets on ancillary players.

Iguodala was an outlier when it comes to FMVP. A guy like Kawhi Leonard is better off with his 2 Finals MVP's then he would be with 2 regular season ones imo.
Damian Lillard  Demar Derozan  Kawhi Leonard  KG  Dwight Howard
"Nowhere does Ibaka say he wasn't a leader.  Norm Powell praised Leonard for his ability to relax his teammates:  ‚ÄúThe one thing Kawhi really stressed to us was just to enjoy it. Don‚Äôt get too out of character, just enjoy the moment and continue to go out there and just lay it on the floor. So it was an amazing feeling just to be able to battle and chip away at it.‚Äù  Pascal Siakam echoed Powell‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always been that guy who you can look at when something goes bad. He just has that calm demeanor. It gives you that peace, knowing that everything is going to be OK. And I feel like that every time I‚Äôm on the floor with him.‚Äù  If you want more, let me know."
Kawhi didn't play against Paul George until college.  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/28111598/clippers-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-destined-play-together](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28111598/clippers-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-destined-play-together)

"Kawhi Leonard, I do find his dry way of interviewing to be hilarious at times, he let his personality whether it was intentional or not show a little bit starting in Toronto but I do not find his game enjoyable to watch even though I respect the skill           Anthony Davis and James Harden as well, again I respect the talent, respect the skill just certain things about their game don't translate to me as far as being entertaining"

"&gt;vested interest in making sure the clippers stay mediocre  yeah but the clippers aren't mediocre... they're top 4 in the west and project to be for the forseeable future. unless you think kawhi leonard is about to leave in FA and george hill is the dealbreaker for that, then I think you make the trade and let the other chips fall where they fall.  the only difference it makes, realistically, is if the clippers miss the playoffs. the only way they'll do that is if kawhi leaves. I don't think the clips not winning this season will cause kawhi to leave."
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"I don't agree with this, the consensus was always Steph Curry was better than guys like Kawhi Leonard, even when the advanced stats put them fairly close to each other, in terms of net impact. There's no major bias against mediocre defenders, it's just that when you're comparing players at this level you nit pick.  As for needing someone who can get you a bucket when the shot clock is winding down, wouldn't it be more valuable to consistently get good shots before the shot clock winds down?"
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."

"Kawhi Leonard, his play style is just sooooo smooooooooth"
"Cool, still the same number of championships in the last 55 years as the Sixers. The Raptors before Kawhi Leonard joined the team made it farther in the playoffs than the Sixers have with Embiid and Simmons. LMAO."
Kawhi Leonard was replaced with Stanley Johnson.
Then why are you bringing up playoff success? Embiid was the best player in a series against Kawhi Leonard and the eventual champions. My comment proves that he didn‚Äôt have the team to progress
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokiƒá|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Donƒçiƒá|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"2016. I'm not sure how to get the numbers, but you can easily look it up since tons of articles were written about it.

Their defensive rating was 106.3 with him on and 91.5 with him off the floor."
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.    Ben is a great perimeter defender (with room to grow), but he's not at Kawhi level. He's likely not at peak Paul George level right now.  ||Peak|Games|DBPM|DPIPM|DLEBRON| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |Ben Simmons|2020-2021|88|+2.2|+1.6|+1.65| |Kawhi Leonard|2014-2016|202|+3.1|+3.5|+3.30| |Scottie Pippen|1994-1995|151|+3.1|-|-| |Tony Allen| 2011-2013|209|+2.7| +3.0|+2.55| |Paul George|2013-2014|159|+2.5|+2.5|+2.38| |Jimmy Butler|2014|67|+2.0|+2.1|+1.65| |Andre Iguodala|2011-2012|129|+2.0|+2.4|+2.0|. |Andrei Kirilenko|2005-2007|180|+3.2|+2.6|-| |Metta World Peace|2002-2004|197|+2.3|+2.2|-| |Draymond Green|2015-2017|236|+3.2|+4.1|+3.75| |Rudy Gobert|2017-2019|218|+2.4|+4.2|+4.15|  Embiid is the best defender on the Sixers.

Kawhi Leonard and James Harden about to be even more rested than LeBron üëÄ
what are you talking about. There a bunch of solid FA options. We dont need to address a star this year as long as we build upon our success and guys like RJ and Randle improve stars will come to us   **2021 Free Agency**  * Kyle Lowry  * Mike Conley * CP3 (PO) * Kawhi Leonard(PO)   **2022 Free Agency**  * Zach Lavine * James Harden (PO) * Jimmy Butler (PO) * Bradley Beal(PO)
Lucas has been helping a good amount of troubled guys during his time with the Spurs and Rockets. Eddie Griffin and that forward who was scared to fly the Rockets took instead of Kawhi Leonard are the only two I can think of that couldn't get on a good path.
"Sigh, I hate idiots like you because you never watch a single game and you think you know shit.  Lowry was our best player. Demar was our franchise player but ask ANY Raptor fan. Lowry was the leader and focal point. We've been top of the East practically every season even when Kawhi sat out 22 games. Nick Nurse had to balance a new roster at the beginning and in the middle of the season. You know what the constant was?  Lowry. Seriously, he was the only one that could facilitate and control the offense.  Check the plus-minus category when Lowry sits and on floor. Before Kawhi we were top of the east, Leonard left we were still top. We lost last year with a game 7 down to the stretch... c'mon bro"
"G&amp;G Grizzlies will forever be my favorite basketball, but yea if you upgrade Jeff Green, Tayshaun Prince, or even Rudy Gay to Kawhi Leonard, I think you‚Äôve got the recipe for a ring.  PG - Mike Conley SG - Tony Allen SF - Kawhi Leonard PF - Zach Randolph C - Marc Gasol  Geez. Hard to imagine many teams scoring +100 against that defensive starting lineup."
Calling Curry a shooter isn't an insult to him and neither is calling Jokic a passing big. How else would you define Kawhi without writing an entire sentence? Kawhi Leonard is a 3 and D superstar and calling him that isn't disrespective or inaccurate.
Because im not betting against Lebron James in the playoffs. Even after last year im not betting against Kawhi Leonard either. The only one who can beat those 2 in the West is each other
"The more superstars you have the more likely you are a great team and great team = chance to win it all. People ignore the great team part and go directly superstar = win it all. I am actually rooting for the Jazz to win if the Suns don't just so it can dispel the narrative you need a top 10 player be a champion. It often takes just 1 example to change an entire perspective. If it weren't for Kawhi Leonard for example, I bet there would be a narrative that a primarily 3 and D player can't be a superstar or even be the best player on a championship team. I remember around 2010-2015 before Curry there was a narrative that the best player on your team can't be a PG to win it all since Kobe, MJ, and Spurs didn't win that way and many of the previous GOAT PG's don't have rings like Stockton, Nash, Chris Paul, and Allen Iverson. Also Jason Kidd and Gary Payton got theirs late, and Magic was almost like a point forward anyway.  I hope the narrative becomes closer to great team = great chance to win it all."
You don't have to have a ring to be a great leader.   Is Kevin Durant a better leader than Chris Paul? Is Kawhi Leonard a better leader than Chris Paul?
"What was Harden's excuse for losing when KD went down in 2019? What about in 2017 when the Spurs were down both Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker, and Harden scored 10 points on 2/11 shooting with 6 turnovers and 6 fouls in a heavily favored elimination game? What happened in those series?"
"They probably are but the way they were so hyped last year to just absolutely deflate the way they did, honestly they have to at least get to the finals I think         Kawhi Leonard who really says anything made a blatant commercial taking a shot at LeBron and declaring Los Angeles his City, and he couldn't even defend it against the other LA team in the Conference Finals, so I don't know if underrated is necessarily the right word but they're going to fly under the radar just because so many media members looked like fools betting for them last year lol"
Mike Scott  James Johnson  Patrick Beverley  Kawhi Leonard Rajon Rondo
If he wants to he absolutely can do that or sign and trade or whatever he's obviously earned that.   But if he wants to stay the Warriors are much better off keeping the roster/picks unless they can score like idk Kawhi Leonard or something.
"Watch the national games.  For comedy and entertainment watch Inside the NBA on TNT.  If you see a game coming up with a great player, watch it.  You'll catch nuggets of wisdom on why they are great from the better announcers.  You will also see at least a couple of spectacular plays every game where you wonder how they managed to do it.  Watch for the players, coaches, and owners that interest you since we don't have a team in Seattle currently.  I personally like watching the Spurs because of Coach Popovich.  I like Coach McMillan's defensive coaching, and he's Mr. Sonic so I'll watch if he's coaching a game.  I'll sometimes turn on a Mavericks game because Mark Cuban is interesting.  If I see Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron, Curry, Damian Lillard, Harden, or some other great I'll stop and watch it.  Heck I'll even turn on Sabonis because I like his dad or Robin Lopez to watch his hook shot."
"Absolutely, no question about it if Paul George plays anything like he did against Dallas last year, I'll go as far as to say the Clippers will be out in the first round         And of course their health, Ibaka is out, I don't know what's up with Patrick Beverley and if Kawhi Leonard still has this foot injury then they're done"
I've seen him lose his dribble enough times to know he's not Kawhi Leonard
"What in the hell are you talking about?  This is my entire fucking point dude.  &gt;Trading for Kawhi Leonard cost the Raptors.  No shit, and benefitted the Spurs ability to try and remain competitive because they received something in return.  &gt;Trading for Paul George cost the Clippers.  Again, no shit, the Thunder are so ridiculously flush with First round picks that they can reasonably hope to begin a rebuild and possibly swing for the fences in a few years because of it.  &gt;How the fuck is one method worse than the other?  Because the best active player in the NBA decided amongst himself, another all-star, and a third top 5 active player to bounce for nothing more than: one worthless pick swap, pair of 1sts **ONLY** through the life of James' contract (which clearly meant they weren't sniffing the lottery) and a trade exception good for one year.  Now let's compare that with the Clippers trade for PG.  Clippers receive: Paul George   Thunder receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Galinari, 2021 unprotected first (Heat), 2022 unprotected first (Clips), 2023 lottery protected first (Heat), 2023 pick swap w/ Clips, 2024 unprotected first (Clips), 2025 pick swap w/ Clips, 2026 unprotected first (Clips)  The Clippers were able to assemble their idea of a Superteam and secure Kawhi, and the Thunder have a literal warchest with which to rebuild.  I hope this helps."
"You missed it again, you arent reading.  Everybody is a different player game to game and everyone has injuries, especially this deep in the season.  I could say ""Hey curry rolled his ankle and has been carrying the Warriors all year! Hes not 100%!"" or ""Hey Damian Lillard is only in a drought because hes probably injured!"" or ""Hey Kawhi Leonard isnt 100% and has been playing too many games, remember his history of sitting out games?  Thats why he only had 19 points!"" or ""Jokic was slowing down because hes been fouled all year with no refs calling it and is getting worn down!""  The list goes on, everyone isnt at 100%.  If you are out there, you are out there because you arent completely injured like every other player."
What garbage reasoning. You're talking about 'team assets' as if teams aren't just given draft picks for free every year. Every trade a GM does has a cost whether it's of his own volition or not. Trading for Kawhi Leonard cost the Raptors. Trading for Paul George cost the Clippers.  The Raptors trade was done through the Raptors own volition. The Clippers trade was because Kawhi told the Clippers to do it. How the fuck is one method worse than the other? How the fuck are the results different? Who fucking cares about 'muh circumstances'

LeBron taking heat for passing to wide-open teammates for shots in the crunch.  Kawhi Leonard for missing the 2017-2018 season with the Spurs due to an injury.  I‚Äôve also heard some people say that James Harden comes up short in the playoffs because he ‚Äúgoes too hard‚Äù during the regular season.  Carmelo Anthony took extra tens of millions of dollars to re-sign with the Knicks rather than signing with the Bulls or Heat.

"Steph beat James Harden without KD in 6, on James' court.  Let's not go there.  The same Kawhi Leonard with a loaded clippers team that could not get to a WCF?"
Lebron got outplayed at his peak by a 21-year old Kawhi Leonard in the Finals. Shit happens
"They were 73-9 without KD.  They had the best record in NBA history without KD.  They were 28-0 without KD.  KD did not make that team a super team.  The only thing that held that  team back, because they were up 3-1 before the injury, was the injury.    Everyone recognized them as a super team before KD. Nobody doubted it.  They were the favorites to win the title before getting KD.  KD did not make them a super team.  KD went to a super team, that was already a title favorite, and that is why they effortlessly won the title.    For recent context, imagine if the Lakers had gotten Kawhi Leonard and then after that KD joined that team.  That is quality of team that KD went to.  They were 3 of the top 10 NBA players BEFORE KD."
"Absolutely, that's why I consider game 7 against Philadelphia back in 2019 to be the greatest game Kawhi Leonard has played so far , it wasn't his most efficient game by any means, he shot 40 times I think but it was so clear that nobody else on the Raptors wanted it, they were looking for him to close the deal and on that particular day he most certainly did, and I'm pretty sure he's going to be faced with a similar moment in the playoffs this year , he needs to have that exact same mentality"
"I think he's somebody that you can't rely on in the playoffs, and yes I know he led his Pacers two back-to-back Conference Finals back in the day, and I didn't believe in him as a superstar then, but ever since he called himself ""Playoff p"" smh, and I said this at the time but Kawhi Leonard would have been better off staying in Toronto or going down to Miami to team with Jimmy Butler, maybe Paul George will prove me wrong in the playoffs this year but I'm not putting any money on it         ( and I know that Kawhi Leonard played like garbage in game seven against the Nuggets but his overall track record still works for me)"

"My man says a lot of funny stuff about Jokic.  ""Kawhi Leonard thought he was playing the cavs on a Tuesday night instead of a passing god"""
"See thats my problem with the Gobert discourse though, i get that hes an extraordinary paint protector and defensive big but when you try to imply that hes in his own league defensively or that hes the nba‚Äôs best defender thats when it becomes an issue.   For the most part the guards he was isoed against werent these quick shiftty guys who have deadly jumpers, they were guys like THT who dont have well developed jumpshots or guys like hill who just simply dont have the skill to take advantage of a guy like Gobert. Even when he did get stops against those top tier guards like Murray i would argue it was more so a result of bad shot selection rather than lockdown defense. For example in the Murray isolation, Murray didn‚Äôt really back up and take his time sizing up gobert, he just kind of put a shot up quickly in a spot where Gobert was comfortable. This is fine if you‚Äôre calling him an a great paint protector with some perimeter ability but if you‚Äôre calling him the best defensive player in the league then you have to talk about him in relation to guys like Draymond Green or Anthony Davis and those are guys that stay with even the most elite guards on a consistent basis. There‚Äôs nobody in this league who Davis cant guard extremely well, but there quite a few players who can score on Gobert fairly easily.   The problem in the playoffs is that as you get deeper and deeper you will inevitably have to face the Kevin Durants, Kawhi Leonards or Steph Currys of the world and when players like that exist in offenses that force everybody to constantly be closing out to perimeter player or force switches then you cant have your best defensive player be someone like Gobert. You need versatility and when thats the case you‚Äôll always be better off with a Draymond Green.  For example look at the perimeter defense of an out of shape Anthony Davis in comparison, taking on Kawhi Leonard in Isolation while also spending lots of time protecting the paint and closing out to the perimeter: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QjcLo3Wbt6A  These kind of shape shifting defenders that can literally do anything you need them to are thd most valuable defensive forces in the nba. They are never vulnerable and they will never be played off the floor.   Heres a few more videos showcasing the defensive versatility of Davis: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k0tn9QRJMec  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IB_S13ELU3c  These are the most valuable defenders in the league."
"Williams easily, this guy has potential to be a 2 way stud similar to a Kawhi Leonard."

I understand that this is hyperbole but it literally is only Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka. And Ibaka left cause the Raptors didn't offer him what he wanted in contract negotiations.

"Lmfao I know! Brown unreadable? Really? Lmfao There‚Äôs only exactly 5 players that wouldn‚Äôt be traded period. Lebron, AD, KD, Leonard, Curry. That‚Äôs it. Everyone else on this list has an equal in the league or doesn‚Äôt contribute to winning at the highest level. If you wanted to win a championship this past decade. Lebron, Curry and Kawhi could all guarantee a chip. Lebron is obviously a guaranteed trip to the finals. Which speaks above all these players combined. Hell he was the only one to win one on a small market team. I don‚Äôt consider Toronto a small market as it is Canada‚Äôs team."
"six?  Try the Big 3 in Nets, Tatum and Brown (at least Tatum), Lebron and AD, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Randle now, Lilliard, Curry, Booker, Luka, Giannis, Embiid. Murray and Jokic.    That's 16 for ya.  Maybe minus Murray and make that 15"
Kawhi Leonard was arguably the greatest perimeter defender of all time before he emerged as an MVP tier player.
"No it wasn't. The spurs [asked for](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/7/3/17533090/lakers-trade-rumors-spurs-brandon-ingram-josh-hart-kyle-kuzma-kawhi-leonard) Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, 2 picks, and 2 pick swaps and everyone including Magic acted like the ask was ridiculous.   [This](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks) is the only trade offer from the lakers that included Ingram - Ingram and one pick and presumably having to take on a negative contract in Dieng."
"I would easily go Jrue! He is just a better teammate. I have always thought as talented as Westbrook is, he can never win a championship with his mentality/ego. But I am biased, I've never been a fan of Westbrook's ego, and as much as he maybe more talented, I would take Jrue.   I am the same age as Jrue and played him a few times in HS (along with a few other NBA players). Jrue IMO was harder to play against than Harden, DeRozan, Leonard, Westbrook (I've never played against him, just sat on the bench since I wasn't getting minutes yet) or Fredette at that time (high school)! Kawhi IMO didn't hit his true bball stride until SDSU (I was in the MWC at the same time as him too) then going to the Spurs allowed him to truly blossom into the amazing talent he is. ."
"Shit, Wiggins has as many points as Kawhi Leonard lmao"
I keep thinking Luke Kennard is Kawhi Leonard when I scan box scores. Lol
Kawhi Kennard and Luke Leonard are my favorite starters.
"I thought the refs sucked for y‚Äôall but theres no way Ja Morant in there complaining about refs after losing to fucking Luke (Kawhi Leonard) Kennard. GG Griz we owed y‚Äôall a bad one, your guys clowned us back to back years."
"The caption wasn't threatening. Let's say LeBron dunked on Kawhi Leonard and then posted a picture of Dame that said you're next. It would've been clear from context that he wasn't threatening the dude's life, so if Dame tried to sue him, he would've been laughed out of court. This is the same deal; when applying any context to it, you can see that the tweet was in no way an actual threat. There was no intended violence; it was a shame tactic, which (while extremely shitty) is absolutely not illegal."
"Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez    They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge"

"Losing your best player is huge. Demar Derozan was a staple for them and would likely still be there if not for the Kawhi Leonard trade.

"LeBron, Davis, Harden, Durant, Kyrie, Embiid, Mitchell, Giannis, Luka, have all missed/are going to miss more games than Kawhi Leonard this season. The only way the regular season doesn't get that proverbial nail in the coffin is if the Clippers, Nuggets, or Suns win the championship."
they are no limited in there touches..These guys are all number 1 options on there teams. YOu think Kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal or Booker never touch the ball. All it means is when ever they get the ball they shoot it.

"Kawhi Leonard is tough because I know he has Defensive Player of the Year Awards, but he's not somebody that anybody saw being a superstar right away, even his first Finals MVP you can make a case that could have gone to two other people on his team ( I myself would have given it to Duncan), and I don't think he truly became a great, franchise-changing player until the 2015/16 season, I think he's just barely passed 10,000 points now, he led an all-time great playoff run which had people calling him the best player in the NBA, a status he lost the very next postseason by blowing a 3-1 lead and choking in game 7, and even though he's chilled out on some of the load management this year I don't think he's ever going to be in position to win an MVP so his legacy is going to be built on all NBA teams and winning , so I could see him being on anybody's list anywhere in between 25-40 all time              I understand Andre Iguodala was a very valuable piece to the Warriors Dynasty and even to Miami getting the finals last year, and even though Max Kellerman turned him into some kind of a meme he does seem to be unusually clutch, but the conversation around Andre Iguodala reminds me of the one that's also being had about Julian Edelman in the NFL, grade intangibles in the playoffs and even though I don't think Andre Iguodala deserved his Finals MVP he has it, not a Hall of Famer              In the case of Giannis Antetokounmpo, top 10 power forward already, I'm comfortable saying that I just don't know where to rank him right now, he's been in the league longer than I thought, he has to get it together in the playoffs, I'm curious as to how he does this playoffs"

"Absolutely they've been playing great but they use up all their hype last year, nobody's going to take them seriously, last year might have been Conference Finals or bust , this year they at least need to get to the finals imo, especially how they blew a 3-1 lead to Denver, and especially now that the Lakers won the championship last year if the Clippers don't at least get to the finals they need to take the master tape of that Kawhi Leonard New Balance commercial and Burn it"
I've seen the Raptors beat the 76ers in an insanely close 7 game series... with Kawhi Leonard also on the team. You have basically the same roster minus one of the best players in the NBA and believe you can still do that?
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."
"They aren‚Äôt playing Kawhi Leonard and historic defensive championship team now. They‚Äôll be able to take care of the Celtics, probably beat the Bucks, but the Nets will be interesting."

To suggest a quick return to play and a condensed schedule has had no effect on the NBA product or the health and safety of the NBA's marquee athletes is willful ignorance."
I'd say a Kawhi Leonard type is pretty rare.  His scoring is almost unreal as his defense.  Hes a complete 2 way player who can take over a game on either end of the court.
"‚ÄúKawhi Leonard, who are you?‚Äù  ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard.‚Äù"
Kawhi leonard is number one and its not even close. when a reporter asked him what a championship would mean to the people of Canada he responded ‚Äúyou should ask someone who‚Äôs been here longer.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey have one (maybe two with Batum) players who can kinda guard Lebron and then a team filled with guys Lebron will savage.‚Äù  So you think Nicolas Batum will do a better job than Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in guarding LeBron James? I‚Äôm gobsmacked.
"For sure, I think a lot of people saw CJ‚Äôs breakout coming, just didn‚Äôt expect it to be so rapid, following a relatively pedestrian second year.    But yeah, the potential was always there, he was a lottery pick for a reason. While the Duke upset gets a lot of attention, he was a beast from the jump. In 2010, he was named to the Sporting News NCAA All-Freshman Second Team. The first team featured John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Favors, Derrick Williams, and Xavier Henry. On the second team, CJ was joined by Kawhi Leonard, Hassan Whiteside, Alec Burks, and Elias Harris. Making that list was clearly a strong predictor of future success."
Casually calling kawhi the second best player on the court when he daddied embiid into crying in the playoffs lol. And I‚Äôm just trying to clarify that missing Tobias Harris does not equal missing kawhi Leonard. But you don‚Äôt really seem to understand that
Perhaps Danny Green?? And idk maybe add in Kawhi Leonard as a trade filler
To be honest man I don‚Äôt follow the NBA to closely so don‚Äôt take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he‚Äôs my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that‚Äôs why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
"You did see that the Clippers got Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, right. They got them for being in LA."
"Great game from the Clippers. Obviously the best player missing from this game was Kawhi Leonard, that's undisputable. But the Sixers were missing Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, and playing Mike Scott, which really hurts our shooting.   Smart job by Lue to double Embiid the entire game and basically force the Sixers to shoot wide open threes from Mike Scott. Kork and DG obviously still have us great shooting but they were helping off of Scott all game. When you see that he went two for infinity from downtown, remember that these were off of absolutely wide ass open threes, usually from the corner.   Anyway. Good job by everyone on both teams, obviously especially PG and Embiid."
&gt; Kawhi Leonard is better and always plays well or at least steady  He scored 2 points in the second half of an elimination game.
Kawhi Leonard is better and always plays well or at least steady. But the flame thrower that is Paul George is what determines where the team  goes
"He played in 76% of games last season and was healthy for 86% of the games last season.   He's played in around 66% of games this year and will most likely hit around 70+% by the season is over.   He's not the epitome of health, but it gets really overblown. Last season he played the same amount of games as Kawhi Leonard, and more games than Joel Embiid. He was only 5 games less than Anthony Davis and Nikola Vucevic.   The same folks that hate on him in /r/mavericks are the same so-called therapists and body language experts who are analyizing his body language and claiming that because he didn't go make out with Luka after his game-winner that he was somehow upset that he didn't get the last second shot and is a cancer to the team."
You forgot Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard. Laker fans smh
"‚ÄúNotorious playoff chokers‚Äù buddy gtfo. Embiid had played in 3 postseasons: one was his first ever, one was ended by a crazy shot by Kawhi Leonard, and the other was in the COVID season."
"Uhh that's not what he said at all.   &gt;I was supposed to guard [Kevin Durant]. We match up well size wise. KD‚Äôs out. The next person I‚Äôm guarding is Kyrie [Irving]. Like, who‚Äôs doing that? It‚Äôs not many players who are doing that. And to be doing it at a high level like that? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anybody else really doing that. I mean, Kawhi [Leonard] when he was really playing defense like that, of course. But, it‚Äôs not too many guys.  Interviewer: Didn‚Äôt Kyrie have, like, 37 last night though?  &gt; Yeah, but we won. His plus/minus was negative, too [it was -13]."
"You didn't want to give up both Kuzma and Ingram for Kawhi Leonard, no shit he was going to say no"
"My pick is Joe Johnson and Kawhi Leonard. Same height, similar builds, both are killers from mid range. Iso Joe would provide great handles and some durability (he only has 2 seasons with less than 50 games played). Kawhi adds 2x DPOY level defense to the mix. Both of them are pretty good 3pt shooters and have decent athleticism and adequate playmaking skills."
Kawhi Leonard is the best player in this series if you look at advanced metrics
"Pre-Balmer, and I mean no insult by this, Utah would have been a much preferred destination than the Clippers by anybody.  Balmer-era, it's sort of nice to enjoy some of the amenities of a big city ngl.  I did enjoy watching my guys squeak by into the playoffs with Larry Brown, and watch my team build from ground up with Brand and co, and so I do know where you're coming from.  And like you, I'd much rather watch my team build from the ground up and mighty mouse my way through championships as it makes it more satisfying.  But, I'm not going to say no if you're just going to hand me a Kawhi Leonard.  Sometimes the little guys need a break."
He was playing behind Kawhi Leonard against a injured Warriors team lol.
yeah they get traded for 1 season of Kawhi Leonard
Wait a minute a kawhi leonard game 7 miracle buzzer beater i have seen this one before
"Last year, you may blame him.  This year, I truly think its the Clippers curse. I legit think Paul George and Kawhi Leonard will be hugely successful in any other teams not named Los Angeles Clippers.   Sorry Clippers fans."
"Most guys in the league don't win shit, especially with LeBron and KD constantly stacking the deck in their favor.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, six players have been the best player on a finals team - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Butler.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, the only players that have won shit are LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis."

"2003: Spurs trade the draft rights to Leandro Barbosa to Phoenix for a 2005 first-round pick  2005: San Antonio trades Malik Rose, the 2005 pick from Phoenix, and a 2006 first round pick for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer. Now, this wasn't bad, since Mohammed played a role in delivering the 2005 championship but then...  2005 NBA draft: New York Knicks draft David Lee with the #30 pick conveyed through the Malik Rose trade.  ----  2011: San Antonio trades George Hill to Indiana for the 15th pick (Kawhi Leonard) and the 42nd pick (Davis Bertans).  2018: San Antonio trades Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to Toronto for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob P√∂ltl, and a 2019 first round pick (Keldon Johnson)."
"If my theory is correct than these should be the teams that jump up in the lottery that lost a star and haven‚Äôt been compensated yet  - Rockets (Lost James Harden)  - Raptors (Lost Kawhi Leonard and about to lose Kyle Lowry)  - Oklahoma City (Lost Westbrook,PG and Cp3)  4th team will be some random team  Orlando won‚Äôt jump up because they got a lottery pick from the Vucevic trade anyway and the Spurs won‚Äôt move up because they still have Derozan"
Toronto also got rid of perennial playoff choker Derozan and replaced him with former Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. No Lebron in the east to stop them probably helps too. It's very possible the Raptors could have still won with Casey.
Can‚Äôt imagine what his foot might feel. I been dealing with Achilles soreness like him and that shit doesn‚Äôt go away until properly let it heal. This man is guarding Kawhi  Leonard
"Bringing up the 50\40\90 club is another weird example because Kawhi has only once be in the club during a post season run, another really poor example of trying to paint Kawhi as an efficient player.   Look man, you're making it very obvious that your opinion of Kawhi is so it's clearly not worth my time trying to show you anything negative about him. Just know that all the stats in the world point to Kawhi Leonard being a slightly above league average volume scorer efficiency wise. He is slightly above league average from 3, slightly above league average from 2, and slightly above average FT shooter.   He is not some godly efficient player, and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that. Not everyone can be Curry/Jokiƒá/LeBron/KD etc. Kawhi is still one of the top 7-12 best players in the league despite that, which is something to be proud of."
"My dream is that the Clippers lose in the first round and decide to blow it up, and Kawhi signs with the Knicks. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely impossible, as Kawhi does seem like the type of person who could be attracted by the idea of being the guy who brings NY a championship, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Still, I think a starting 5 of Quickley/Barrett/Leonard/Randle/Robinson would be a serious contender for a championship, especially if we can sign a more traditional PG like Lonzo and use Quickley in a Lou Williams, offensive spark-plug 6th man role"
Kawhi Leonard shot 76.5% tonight
Yea bro kawhi fucking leonard is more disrespected than a guy whos negative highlights get more upvotes than his positive ones lmfaoo. just admit you hate lebron.
"I remember earlier in the regular season, I said when my team lost to Dallas, Dallas benefited from not playing Porzingis against us, as we fucking destroyed him when he is on the court in the 2 home games we played against Dallas this season.  It gives me no pleasure to say anything bad about a player, but holy shit, Porzingis was the 3rd best Clipper player today, and it only was because Paul George and Kawhi Leonard were that good. Seriously, he looks completely different from the guy I saw last year when he was good against the Clippers."
I'll do you one better: Kawhi Leonard is a top 3 playoff player in the NBA right now.
"really rough game for him and this is coming from a huge Porzi≈Üƒ£is fan. He had some nice passes out of the double team but that's about the only positive I can come up with. We've got to give credit to the Clippers defense. Their gameplan all series has been to keep Porzi≈Üƒ£is out of the game and let Luka get his.  Porzi≈Üƒ£is still could impose his will more, and it's frustrating he's not doing so, especially as a max player, but he's being guarded by Kawhi Leonard almost every possession."
"Kawhi ""Zion"" Leonard"
Why is Kawhi Leonard playing defence??
Kawhi Leonard needs to team up with Luka.
Ik y‚Äôall hate the Clippers but you gotta give Kawhi Leonard and Pg-13 credit for this performance
Kawhi Leonard is the Mavericks killer  He demolished them last year as well
I would enjoy it if Kawhi Leonard MISSED MORE SHOTS
I love zubac but he better be happy that kawhi not the type of dude to snap on his teammates because holy shit that last pick and roll he ran with kawhi... That was awful. He took an easy Leonard layup and turned it into a tough finish versus three defenders (including zubac)
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George with a combined 19-24
I love how despite the fact that Kawhi Leonard is fucking dominating the Mavericks this series the narrative if the Clippers end up losing will be that he's a choker or that he's overrated

"Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, David Robinson.  Honorable mentions- Manu Ginobili, George Gervin, Kawhi Leonard."
"Tim MacMahon at ESPN said he scored on them, too:  &gt;Late in the third quarter of Game 2, the Clippers desperately needed a defensive stop, so they tried pulling the ace out of their sleeve. Kawhi Leonard, the superstar who has earned a reputation as one of the premier stoppers in NBA history, matched up against Luka Doncic.   &gt;   &gt;The Mavericks responded by clearing out the right side of the court and letting their superstar go to work. Doncic backed down Leonard, pounding dribble after dribble until he got to the spot he wanted, then pivoted into a pretty one-legged fadeaway that surely made Staples Center spectator and Mavs legend Dirk Nowitzki proud.   &gt;   &gt;Swish.   &gt;   &gt;Welp, so much for that supposed solution. Head coach Tyronn Lue's Clippers tried pretty much everything to slow down the Mavs' superstar in the first two games of the series. They're still searching for something that works.

"No, he was going to the Clippers regardless but he wanted to be in the best situation possible so he held out on signing until they got him PG. That's why there was so much noise about LA- to put pressure on the Clippers to ensure PG was there. I think there was an athletic article that outlined all of this in 2019. Basically says Kawhi didn't want to form a superteam with LeBron and didn't want to stay in Toronto. [https://theathletic.com/1086977/2019/07/23/inside-story-los-angeles-la-clippers-pursuit-of-kawhi-leonard-paul-george/](https://theathletic.com/1086977/2019/07/23/inside-story-los-angeles-la-clippers-pursuit-of-kawhi-leonard-paul-george/)  When you have that kind of bargaining power, you don't just sign what's offered. You force the best offer."
Yea. Harden was literally dropping 30+ on the clippers while getting doubled team by pg13 and Kawhi fucking Leonard. Now they‚Äôre giving KD AND Kyrie. No one stopping that offense
oh please tell me how many Nets games you've seen with Kawhi Leonard.
No one tell him about DeMar DeRozan to Kawhi Leonard either.
"You are taking innocuous quotes and just projecting on to them. Pop did say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this.‚Äù Why? Because he had never seen anything like it. They had misdiagnosed his injury and everything they we‚Äôre seeing was saying he was good to go (which makes sense when you‚Äôre looking for the wrong things). That‚Äôs why they brought him back mid season. But when he was still in pain they pulled him.   &gt;	There was in fact news reports at the time that Popovich said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that guy around here.‚Äù There was also reports that Popovich did not want Kawhi to return from injury, he said ‚Äúthere is only so many games left in the season.‚Äù There were at least 15 more season games more to be played when he said that. He literally kept Kawhi out.  Please find those reports because I‚Äôm pretty sure that never happened. What I do remember happening was reports saying they constantly asked Kawhi to declare him out for the season and he was against that. I can believe that. I remember during the 14-15 season, Leonard was out. Close to Christmas, he claimed he would be ready to play that day. Not only did he not play on Christmas, it took about another month for him to be cleared. Kawhi is a competitor. I‚Äôm sure that he felt like he was only a few days/weeks away and was dying to get back on the court.   Then from the Spurs position, every single time they played a game, they had to deal with ‚ÄúIs Kawhi playing?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his condition?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen is he coming back?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill he be ready for playoffs?‚Äù Every single game it was questions they didn‚Äôt have the answers to. What they wanted was to stop all the constant questions.   Kawhi wasn‚Äôt even declared out for the season until game 2 of the playoffs. So you‚Äôre saying they went through all that for an extra 16 games for fun? Come on.   And through all that, there was still a chance. During the summer, you had Green telling people to relax and don‚Äôt believe the hype, Jabari telling Spurs fans they‚Äôre lucky, and stories about Kawhi spending millions to redo the foundation of his house. I don‚Äôt know what was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back, but during that off season all signs pointed to him staying and committing to the Spurs.   Once again, I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre completely wrong. I do think there was tension coming from Tony and Manu, who we‚Äôre desperate to make a deep playoff run since retirement was around the corner. The disrespect and vitriol thrown his way from the fandom was disgusting. People were going after his sister. And shitting on his uncle? You‚Äôre berating the man who stepped up in Leonard‚Äôs life after his father was murdered. What the fuck?!?! They should‚Äôve addressed that. I get that no one wants to address comments on the internet, but the attacks were endless and they should‚Äôve stepped up and said that‚Äôs not ok.   &gt;I can understand that they may not want to give the player the max contract, but this was not the way to do it. No franchise has ever done it this way, ruining a player‚Äôs reputation, which could destroy his career and even his psychology too.  This is such a foul assumption. It sounds like you‚Äôre claiming they orchestrated this whole scenario so they could offer him a smaller contract?   Kawhi was one of my favorite players and he still is. Back when he was on the team and everyone around here was saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs only this good because of the system‚Äù I constantly railed against that. When people were claiming he only got that good because of the Spurs, I constantly said he was gonna be this good regardless because he has that drive. I rooted for him in Toronto. I rooted for him in LA. And I‚Äôve made peace with the move, but I still kinda wish he‚Äôd come back. But I don‚Äôt know how you can claim objectivity and think this was entirely on the Spurs. There was a breakdown in communication between the parties and that falls on both sides."
"Kawhi had no jump shot in college. He shot 25% on threes and wasn't much better from midrange. From a [pre-draft report](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Kawhi-Leonard-5821/):  &gt; What makes Leonard an enigmatic prospect is his lack of a go-to offensive skill, despite the many different ways he was involved in San Diego State's game plan. According to Synergy Sports Technology, no single offensive situation accounted for more than 17% of his touches, with Spot-Ups, Isolations, Put Backs, Fast Breaks, Cuts, and Pick and Roll situations each accounting for anywhere between 8-18% of his total possessions. Leonard ranks right around the 45th percentile amongst all NCAA players in each of those metrics in terms of Points Per-Possession.  &gt;  &gt; His lack of tremendous situational efficiency stems from the fact that there are a number of holes in his game that he'll need to work on, especially out on the perimeter. Leonard's most notable weakness is his lack of jump shooting ability. ***Connecting on just 32% of his catch and shoot jumpers and 28% of his pull-ups last season, the sophomore struggled with his consistency from range***. As with all players noted for their hand size, there are questions about Leonard's ability to develop a reliable jump shot. While there is some merit to that stereotype, if will be necessary for Leonard to continue honing that part of his game to the greatest extent possible."
"It‚Äôs easier to be playoff rondo when you have some of the greatest leaders in your locker room, much harder when your ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are George Paul and Kawhi Leonard"
"I'll admit I'm relatively uninformed when it comes to the ins and outs and X's and O's of basketball, but from a pure fan perspective, the Clippers aren't cohesive and also aren't having fun. That sounds silly but what I mean is that it looks like Kawhi and PG are both very concerned with what they are doing as individuals. Meanwhile, the rest of the team isn't playing well effectively. The role players aren't really playing their roles and the matchups aren't working because the Clipper's ""gameplan philosophy"" seems to rely on domination alone. When the team sees adversity, they panic and up the ""toughness"" without actually responding to what's in front of them.   When you got a guy like Luka, you almost have to sell out to stop him. If that means Leonard scores 28 instead of 41 then you have to do it. At the same time, there's no floor general or leader on the team. Watching the Clippers is like watching a pickup game at the gym where all the big, tough guys join together and try to dominate the scrappers. Once the scrappers gel together and get into their rhythm, the tough guys start to get sloppier because they ""underestimated"" their opponent.  Maybe I'm way wrong here but that's the perspective I've gotten from watching these two games vs Dallas and the whole Denver series last year."
"Kawhi and Beverly for Wiggins, #4 pick, and Wiseman ?  If the MN pick isn't #4 then throw in Warriors #14 as well.  Assuming Leonard wanted out of course."
I remember when [this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2807641-gregg-popovich-says-kawhi-leonard-wasnt-a-leader-with-spurs) came out and people were trying to say Kawhi was a leader and that Pop was just salty  Maybe Pop was a little bit salty but he wasn't wrong
"I want to say ‚ÄúMatisse Thybulle and Ben Simmons are the defenders we think Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to be‚Äù . But I‚Äôll wait. Even though Beal is a tough, I‚Äôll wait till they meet a tougher team opponent..  ...matter of fact let me just go tweet it.  Forget what you just saw!"
"Defensive anchor missed 1 game because of his own actions. They still had the 1st and 2nd best shooters of all time. They still had defensive anchor for 6 of 7 games. They didn't miss Boguts 5 points a game that series and you pretending they did is beyond stupid. When GSW won in 2015 which you inexplicably think was a heavier championship Kawhi Leonard was injured, Love and Kyrie were injured. Huge difference. Spurs were missing near 30 points of scoring. Cavs were missing 40 points of scoring. Do you get it yet or are you gonna continue to be deliberately obtuse?"
"Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Pat Bev, and Serge Ibaka are also smart/disciplined defenders and Luka‚Äôs still averaging 35/9/9.  He‚Äôs a generational talent and you will see why. If you think Royce O‚ÄôNeal and Joe Ingles are going to contain him then you‚Äôre in for a long series."
I don't think you're talking about the same Kawhi Leonard
Dillon Brooks became Kawhi Leonard with knees these two games and the rest of the team has been decent to good all season?
"Damn, I feel bad for the Clippers if Kawhi Leonard leaves. They gave up way to much for that to happen."

"uhhhh theres a pretty big difference between demar derozan leading a team and kawhi leonard leading a team, or even jonas valinchunas as your starting centre versus marc gasol lol....goddam casual"
They dumped their all-time franchise star player for one year of mercenary Kawhi Leonard who didn't even want to be there and left as soon as he could so if they could win a cheap ring when all the Warriors players got hurt.  and now they're crying that he left them üòÇüòÇ
he could be living in this [house](https://patch.com/california/pacificpalisades/kawhi-leonard-buys-pacific-palisades-home-17-million) in the Pacific Palisades he just bought.
"Bruh it‚Äôs been two games calm down with ‚Äú better than MJ‚Äù talk. Luka hasn‚Äôt been a scrub either, he is right behind imo, in terms of playoff performances this season. Luka is also 2-0 against Kawhi Leonard and Paul George."
"Ay bro you forgot to mention the fact that Lebron has not faced a team as good as the 2019 Raptors (besides GSW obviously) in the last 4 years. 17 and 18 Eastern teams clearly weren‚Äôt as good, we didn‚Äôt reach the playoffs in 2019, and the 2020 Playoff teams we faced were not as good as the 2019 Raptors.  Also I never said DEFINITELY. It would be a close series but I think they would‚Äôve edged us out due to the fact that they matchup super well against us. Even in 2020 without Kawhi we seemed lost when we played them. Also never said the Raptors were the dynasty Warriors, but they definitely are better than any of the other non GSW teams Lebron has faced since 2017.  Also they were not the same choker Raptors as 2015-18. Better coach, deeper roster and Demar was replaced with Kawhi Leonard. They beat GREAT teams like the Bucks and the 76ers to reach the finals. It isn‚Äôt fair to act like they‚Äôre the same team they were without Kawhi."
"Not only are PG and Kawhi considered two of the best two way players in the NBA, they are considered two of the best defenders in the NBA.  Your worried about saving energy of their two best offensive players....They need to be worried about actually expending energy of their two best defenders. Pat Bev is not the answer.  OR Get the switch you want on the other end and make Luka expend energy on defense. Either way you gotta go at him with your best guy on either end. But again, any guy not named Paul George or Kawhi Leonard is not the answer on defense."
Kawhi Leonard should have never wanted to leave Toronto.
"Depends on how you look at it. In complete isolation I think Luka only tried him twice and scored once with a fade away. However, if you want to count screens where they didn‚Äôt switch and Leonard tried to get through then you could say as much as 12.   It‚Äôs kind of subjective, because there are some late switches and some plays where Leonard goes under the screen and then Luka crosses back to the other side and Kawhi just gets hung on the screener.  It‚Äôs also clearly in the Mavs game plan for Luka to hunt Zubac and Beverley anytime they‚Äôre on the floor. So, a lot of times they just keep screening until they get a match up they like. He got like another 6 or 8 on George also in the first half and didn‚Äôt seem bothered by him much at all."
‚ÄúBREAKING NEWS:  Kawhi Leonard has just signed a 5 year deal with the dodgers farm club for AAA baseball‚Äù
Did this fool just say can you build around Kawhi Leonard?
"&gt;Worth more in LA than Seattle and outside of finances it‚Äôs far better to be in LA for FA‚Äôs. Kawhi only joined because it was LA.  Not that many major free agents actually sign in Los Angeles.  The Lakers have signed two major ones in their entire history -- James and Shaquille O'Neal, both of whom also signed free agent deals in places like Cleveland and Boston.  The third-best Laker free agent signing was Kurt Rambis -- who was not even in the league, at the time.  The Clippers have signed Leonard, and Chris Paul -- the latter only because of ""Basketball Reasons"".  &gt;Look at thunder, Westbrook, Durant, harden all got out  Harden and Westbrook were traded.  Is there that much difference between Oakland and Seattle?  No, I don't think so.  &gt; I don‚Äôt think balmer cares about a Seattle team as much as he does winning a championship.  Probably true, but I don't think there's a strong argument that being a distant second in their own city helps the Clippers cause much."
Kawhi Leonard down 2-0 against a team spearheaded by a young MVP caliber player with no other all-nba player and good supporting pieces.  Wait a sec
Next summer I believe.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/kawhi-leonard-8066/
"How is that funny? He didn't say it was likely, just that he hopes it happens. The guy averaged 28.8/9.4/8.8 during his second season in the league at 20 years old. Now he's cooking a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.   No, it's definitely not likely that he ends up top 5. But it's certainly not impossible."
"They thought if they had both Kawhi Leonard and Lawhi Kennard, they‚Äôd be in good shape."
"""Kawhi Leonard... You trash. Patrick Beverly... You trash. Paul George... Paul George listen to me when I say this... YOU are trash. Now, I deserve to be fired, don't get me wrong, I'm not disagreeing with the decision they about to make. Because I left you out there for 38 minutes I deserve to be fired. You wasn't doing \*\*\*\*! I seen it all 38 minutes... Kawhi Leonard. If I see yo name on another top 10 list I'm gon kill somebody. I better not hear your name compared to LeBron again or I'm gon kill somebody. I don't want nobody saying Kawhi Leonard and LeBron James in the same sentence, not in the same paragraph, not in the same essay. Unless trash comes after Kawhi Leonard's name."" -Doc Rivers before getting fired last year and soon to be Ty Lue this year too lol (shoutout to RDCworld)"
Leonard putting up 33.5/8/4.5 and Luka putting up 35/8.5/9. Pretty similar on points and rebounding but Luka is generating an extra 9-12 points a game from assists. Also consider they‚Äôre putting up similar numbers on the same shooting splits and the Clippers have 2 of the games best wing defenders while the Mavs have average defenders at best to guard kawhi. The Clippers were the 8th best defense and the Luka is just torching them. I‚Äôm not saying Luka is better than kawhi by a mile but he is making a bigger impact this series.
"If you think Kawhi Leonard is overrated then you either haven't watched him play over the years or know absolutely nothing about basketball.  What a terrible, revisionist history take."
"Take it back a little more than that too.  Kawhi got 30 points in the first half and the Clippers had a 1 possession lead. Leonard had a god mode half and his team couldn't get a lead with any kind of buffer at all so when he cooled down in the second, they couldn't even hang."
"&gt;Who said he wanted to be a leader?  Kawhi did.  &gt;Have you ever heard him say that?  Yup.   ""I lead by example coming into practice every day. Just going hard and coming into these games mentally focused,"" said Leonard. ""You can't see things once you're playing on the floor. Guys ask me questions about their matchup, or if I see something on the floor, I'm telling guys, 'Go here, go there,' just motivating people.  ""I'm just trying to lift people's spirits up, that's about it. Don't try to get anybody too down, just lift them up.""  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/11/25/kawhi-leonard-responds-gregg-popovich-leadership-criticism-spurs-raptors/2111722002/  Again going back to my original question, which you still haven't answered: if Luka leads his Mavs past kawhi's clippers, then how can you argue Kawhi is the better player?"
"I've heard in some podcasts that it was degenerative, but apparently it's not clear. But his injury could enter the third stage, which is to be avoided, so he still has to manage that. [Here's](https://www.google.de/amp/s/www.3cbperformance.com/blog/kawhi-leonard-knee-injuries-load-management%3fformat=amp) an article on that."
Clippers have paul george and Kawhi Leonard now.
can i have a raptors and kawhi leonard? Thanks!
"Kawhi Leonard, Mr. Load Management on a team coached by Mr. Fuck Your Load Management Thibs?  Sounds like a match made in hell.  Joking aside, I really don't know.  When a top 10 player wants to come to your team you make it fit somehow.  However it's off-putting to have  Kawhi who ""needs"" his breaks to be on a team that has been known to absolutely despise them."

"&gt; Leonard is a better pure scorer  Disagree - on the offensive end of the floor there's nothing Kawhi can do that Luka can't. At best, you can say they have similar offensive talents. *And* Luka is obviously the better playmaker as you yourself mentioned - makes everyone around better, something you can't really say about Leonard. Won't even mention Luka's ridiculous upside, being as he is, 22 years young.     Hmm...guess I just did."
"Stupid ass take. Kawhi Leonard is an amazingly talented player and good enough to be the #1 man on a championship team. He just doesn't possess leader qualities, but that doesn't make him any less good. The leader of a team doesn't have to be the best player and the best player doesn't have to be the leader.   Your leader could be the 6th man of your team, doesn't matter as long as the rest buys in and has faith in him."
Is Kawhi Leonard the Joe Flacco of the NBA?
Plot twist: Kawhi Leonard signs with Dallas in Free Agency.
"I still believe Kawhi Leonard is overrated. The man won the first chip with the big 3 in San Antonio, then moved to Toronto where they already had a great team, and he wasn't the leader there either. And now in Los Angeles, it shows that he's just guy who was fortunate enough to be on good teams and has 2 championships."
Also if they get bounced early Kawhi Leonard might just decline his player option and bounce himself.
"I just want to say Kawhi Leonard is an idiot, and the Clippers can kiss my ass"
You are speaking about a rookie on a 8 seed where they traded half the team in February. I am not sure that they had any identity at All.  No pressure thing works with low level seeds. Every team with Kawhi Leonard is Championship or bust situation.
"you didn't watch the games last year if you think that Kawhi played better than Doncic... and you don't watch the games if you throw stats to try to prove that Kawhi is better. watch the games. the kid is killing the Clippers like he did last year. even when Kawhi is tring to guard him. like I said in my first comment, there are valid arguments to argue that Doncic is right now a better player than Kawhi, and the argument that he needs to win a series before to be able to be compare, your original argument, is silly. it's not an argument. he doesn't needs to win a series because basketball is a team sport, just like Jordan didn't need to win a series to prove that he was better than Moses Malone or even Larry Bird (""it's just god disguised as Micheal Jordan"", remember? he lost that game). but you do need to watch the games if you really think that Leonard played better than Doncic last year...  &amp;#x200B;  ps: there are comments like yours arguing that PG is better than Doncic! LOL"
"they'd have to trade Wiggins + Wiseman and some combination of picks. I think it would be beneficial for both teams. if Wiseman develops and they hit on their picks the Clippers would be better off than with Kawhi. as for the Warriors, having Curry and Leonard would allow them to lure veteran ring chasers on cheap contracts to fill the roster and they would have more than enough talent to win another ring or two."

Paul George and Kawhi Leonard started playing good.
"Because Luka is more physical, more of a mismatch. He has had the misfortune of meeting up with Kawhi Leonard early in his playoff career and he's still performed incredibly  I've always been a defender of the Trae trade but that's the reason everybody would take Luka over him."
I mean I can't blame him... he's not supposed to be creating and having that much fingerprints on the offense.  You expect him to produce a lot when Mitchell is hurt and Kawhi Leonard is guarding him most of the time?
"I too agree when Leonard and Kawhi turn it up, they win. Imagine having them both. Leagued fucked"
&gt; Leonard and Kawhi  lol what?
Leonard and Kawhi?
Leonard and Kawhi??? Lol that‚Äôs the same person
Does anyone have the link to the Kawhi Leonard post about his 4th quarter stats this postseason?
If Mitchell keeps up this level of play he‚Äôs a top 5ish player in the league to me. He‚Äôs been outplaying kawhi Leonard and PG which is wild.

He admitted it wasn't a basketball play but to Change the momentum of the game. Likely it came from frustration.   And he didn't say he wanted to be physical. That happens all the time. He said he wanted to foul him hard. Foul him hard.   That is never acceptable. And Reddit knows it.   Lord forgive us all if Paul George or Pat Bev or Kawhi Leonard even looked at Luka with the same intent as Jokic had.   World War III.
"It is AMAZING that you tried to cover for your own failure to do math at an elementary school level by picking a different player...who will be literally the exact same age when he finishes his own seventeenth season. Shout out to you for never giving up but good lord this is embarrassing.  Kawhi is 29 and has played 10 seasons:  * 10 + 7 more seasons = 17 * 29 + 7 = 36 years old  Durant is 32 and has played 13 seasons (been in the league for 14, but I'm not including the one he missed because of his Achilles injury):  * 13 + 4 more seasons = 17 * 32 + 4 = 36 years old  Pro tip: in the future, break out the calculator or ask an adult for help before posting.  Also: big props for calling Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant bums, just absolute commitment to the stan right there.  Go back to r/Lakers my dude. Being a fanboy is bad for your mental health."
"Simmons has become a joke and I don't think he actually watches basketball anymore.    Just to show how unrealistic 22 games is, here are some numbers.  Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen played together for 9 seasons.  [They scored 30 in the same game just 20 times, including 4 times in the playoffs.](  https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/10-craziest-scottie-pippen-stats-throughout-his-nba-career)  Kawhi and PG have only played 80 regular season games together and 23 playoff games.  In their shared reg season games, [Kawhi averages 24.6 ppg](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/how-many-games-did-kawhi-leonard-and-paul-george-played-together) and [PG averages 21.6 ppg](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/how-many-games-did-paul-george-play-with-kawhi-leonard), and 29.1 ppg and 22.0 ppg respectively in the playoffs.    Scoring 30 in the same game 5 times is more than reasonable.  At some point, you just have to ask if people have unrealistic expectations for Kawhi and PG.  That's not a Kawhi and PG problem.  That's a problem with the person holding them to unrealistic expectations."
lol you really think kawhi leonard being injured or not had anything to do with the dubs winning that series are you insane  that's like being an r/nba overreactor taken to the extreme
Yeah I'm not of that mindset. Lakers won fair and square. They said Lakers wouldn't get past the small ball rockets and proceeded to give them a gentlemens sweep. The Clippers were supposed to be next but they choked. And Lakers then proceeded to do the same to the nuggets. Lakers didn't have an easy path. Their opponents just sucked ass. On the other hand though Kawhi Leonard absolutely has an * on his ring against the Heavily depleted GSW.

"Russ finishing higher in MVP voting in 2015-16 is only a really small part of it. He outplayed KD in the regular season and the playoffs. KD himself called Russ the best player on OKC during that season.  Playoffs:   Russ - 25/7/11/3 on 52% TS  KD - 25/6/3/1 on 54% TS  This is while Russ was the primary focus of opposing defenses. The Spurs put back to back DPOY Kawhi Leonard on Russ while KD was guarded by Danny Green in the WCSF. KD was fucking awful in the first round (26/6/3 on 37/27/85 splits, 48% TS, most misses in a playoff game in the last 30 years) and they wouldn‚Äôt have won a single series without Russ.   Funny that you mention on off net rating as your argument for KD being ‚Äúby far their best player‚Äù. Russ had over twice the on-off net rating as KD.

"Because these numbers lack context?  Guess what the numbers don't tell you:   How the Clippers decided to defend Mitchell.   How if you force Mitchell to drive left, he's putting up a really bad shot.   How if the refs aren't fucking around with Zubac, he's an excellent defender at the rim when contesting Mitchell.   Kawhi Leonard in the double team shading Mitchell left is the best possible way to guard him, forcing him into tough jumpers that aren't sustainable.   Numbers also had Bogdonavich apparently putting clamps on Kawhi. That don't mean shit obviously, looking at game 3.  Numbers also had Palu Groge choking it up. But they don't tell you that putting Gobert in the PnR is going to destroy him on defense because he can only engage in drop coverage."

LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard.  Arguably the 2 greatest small forward of the post Jordan Era.  Another thing about playoff wins is that you usually have to have long series to accumulate those wins.  And did I say that Lue was a bad coach.  No I just said he was getting outcoached in this series.  Also I love how you go to my team like that's relevant in a conversation between the Jazz and Clippers.  Sit down.  Butthurt fan.
"... are you suggesting that Kawhi ""I gotta dunk this ball for work but I feel no joy"" Leonard is on stimulants?  Because if so... Ballmer better get him something stronger."
"I still maintain that Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the series, even though I acknowledge Donovan Mitchell is playing way better through three games."
"4 of these bots and Kawhi Leonard vs 5 D3 basketball players. In order for them to shoot Kawhi has to pass them the ball and hit a target (say on their chest).   Let's say the Robots have to get to 25 pts in 15 possessions. The D3 athletes can only play defense.    The Robots can be spaced wherever you want on the court (around the 3 point line of course, not at half court)    Who do you guys think is winning?"
Is this robot called Kawhi Leonard?
"What they said is correct. I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre getting so feisty when you‚Äôre the one rewriting things with the Raptors addition haha. Kawhi absolutely was not going to sign if they didn‚Äôt trade for another star, specifically Paul George once they showed him the list.   Quotes from Doc Rivers:  &gt;	[Leonard] said, ‚ÄòI want to play for you,‚Äô and he pointed at me. He said, ‚ÄòMr. Ballmer, I love the things you do and what you stand for, but your team is not good enough and if you don‚Äôt change your team, I‚Äôm not coming.‚Äô   &gt;	We actually had a list of guys, which was a mistake, but we got lucky,‚Äù Rivers said. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt have had a list, because then he got to choose who he wanted to play with and the assumption was that we could get them. We didn‚Äôt know if we could get anybody. We just showed him guys that we thought would match him and when he saw Paul George‚Äôs name he said, ‚ÄòI want to play with him.‚Äô  Source: https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2019-09-18/doc-rivers-hero-clippers-signed-kawhi-leonard-paul-george"
yea kawhi was 4/12 in the first half..... it was George that kept them in the game with 20 points. Leonard played great but if anyone‚Äôs mentioning winning performances tonight it should be PG‚Äôs
"LeBron going west and a guy named Kawhi Leonard joining the team might've helped, just taking a wild guess"
KAWHI LEONARD IS NOT A TORONTO RAPTOR
‚ÄúKawhi Leonard is smiling folks‚Äù   :|

kawhi leonard is amazing to watch
# KAWHI MOTHERFUCKING LEONARD
Paul George and kawhi Leonard are repeatedly finishing over him.  Even pulling off lob dunks on him
Zubac just did an impression of me trying to catch a lob from Kawhi leonard
Like Kawhi Leonard here *misses open layup*
"Not to be rude, but this season will be another failure if the Clippers miss yet another conference finals. The Jazz are great, but you guys have Kawhi fucking Leonard who is a 2 time FMVP/top 5 player, and whom many were calling the best player after his 2019 playoffs dominance. And its not like he's playing with bums and having to carry the team."
"This was also the game where Kawhi Leonard choked at the line making the Ray Allen 3 possible. If Kawhi hits his FTs, Spurs win that title."
"Damn Shaq lol, I actually agree with Joker but in the case of Kawhi Leonard maybe not the sweep itself but it just feels like it's going downhill for him ever since he made that New Balance commercial lol"
"Blazer did him a favor by giving him a supermax extension.  Btw look at AD, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, they weren‚Äôt able to successfully force trades until their final year under contract."
"&gt; A Toyota engineer said it would take about 20 years for robots like Cue 3 to incorporate skills like running, dribbling, and ‚Äî of course ‚Äî dunking. Toyota will host another Cue 3 demonstration during halftime at an April 10 B.League game between Alvark Tokyo and Sun Rockers Shibuya.  clearly they are not aware of Kawhi Leonard"
"I agree with the definition of what a generational talent is, and would reassert my position that placing three players on same team with said generational talent requires nothing more than telling players to score. There is no need for a method for this years Nets team. Barring some unforeseen change, they hang a banner.    The additional conversation of the pre-KD Warriors team is interesting to me. Yes, I would would agree that Steph is and was then a superstar, but you entirely left out 2014-15 All-Star Klay Thompson. The Warriors had the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù approach prior to KD. Let‚Äôs not sell their talent pool short. Also, Draymond is undersized at the 4, much like Barkley in his Suns days, but was also on a tear defensively that led to his 16-17 DPOY trophy. He was also runner-up for DPOY in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. Again, they were an absolutely stacked team.  Again, my conversation was set to show that perhaps there is another shift in the league that will impact the way teams are built and developed. Unfortunately, the harsh truth is that as long as superstar talent teams with multiple All-Stars are successful on winning championships, big names will continue to try and manipulate the league into fitting this format. See Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis.   The other side shows that teams like Portland have tried to maintain their identities, but don‚Äôt have anything to show for it. Balanced talent needs solid leadership and good coaching. It is much easier for a GM to win a championship by hollowing out small market teams than to build through development. See again Kawhi Leonard single handedly killing the Spurs."
What about the 2019 playoffs where he won a championship beside Kawhi Leonard as the second option?
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
Him and Cp3 were probably the best players on the team in the regular season. His growth is so similar to Kawhi Leonard lol.
"It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs holding him back. Is Luka held back by his emotions? Is Joel Embiid? Is Jokic? No. They‚Äôre all capable of displaying emotion and still being top-tier players. There‚Äôs like literally two guys in the league who don‚Äôt display emotion, and it‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard and Kendrick Nunn lmao."
Can't count Kawhi Leonard out too
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."

Durant.  Somehow everyone says that Massai ujiri is some kind of a genius because he did whatever it took to win a championship. He dumped their all-time franchise star player for one year of mercenary Kawhi Leonard so they could win a cheap ring when all the warriors players got hurt.  and Leonard didn't even want to be there and left as soon as he could. But they got their ring and that's all that matters. Durant wanted a ring and he got it and that's all that matters. you see how badly clowned Barkley and guys like Stockton and Malone are for not winning rings. It's a big deal for these guys

"Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard are all better so no. I would say Jokic is better too. Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic have a great argument too."
"Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard said the team won't back down from the challenge of trying to come back from a 2-0 series deficit for the second straight series after a Game 2 loss to the Utah Jazz on Thursday night.  ""We all got to put our will out on the floor,"" Leonard¬†[told reporters](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31609214/kawhi-leonard-says-la-clippers-challenge-0-2-again).

or when kawhi Leonard leaves the clippers for the okc thunder and still ends up as the worst team on the league
"The Clippers have been trapping him a lot in this series, and as soon as the trap springs, Kawhi starts hunting for the incoming pass. Kawhi is crafty as hell at this and makes Mitchell think there's an open man, but he's ready to spring on it. A trap within a trap. Mitchell just needs to somehow clock Leonard better when he's making his passing decision."
"@wojespn: ‚ÄúKevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and Joel Embiid have signed with the Seattle Sonics, with Kyle Lowry likely to join on the veteran minimum.‚Äù"
"Paul George getting all the hate while Kawhi continues to coast through portions of the game and play it cool and safe. PG-13 was better tonight than Leonard, but of course he'll be the target of everyone's blame.  If anyone's overrated, it's Kawhi."
"At least PG plays with fire unlike play-it-safe Kawhi the Coaster.  PG outplayed him tonight, but of course he's still the guy getting all the blame.  If anyone's overrated, it's Leonard."
"&gt;There's a reason why the Clippers starting going to Jackson more rather than him in the course of the game, which actually allowed them to take the lead.  You and I must have watched a different game, because I saw Paul George initiating the offense on most possessions, including two big and-one layups. One of the two threes hit by Jackson during this stretch I believe was set up by a Paul George penetration, and the other was set up by a transition steal by Kawhi Leonard.  Jackson did run a few half-court possessions, but I really wouldn't say ""they went to Jackson because George wasn't working"" or something like that."
Bojan went absolute man mode tonight. He really did a good job on Kawhi Leonard.
"On a team with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, you can‚Äôt have Reggie Jackson be your best offensive option and expect to win. Clippers need to dig out of a 2-0 deficit once again, they can definitely do it. But they gotta prove it again."

"I think the bubble was its own special anomaly, some people look at it as weaker, some people say it was harder oh, it'll definitely be polarizing for years to come, this current postseason, especially if Greek Freak now has an ACL injury, and we don't know what's going to happen out west but unless the Clippers win without Kawhi Leonard or the Atlanta Hawks somehow win the title, Phoenix winning this Championship is going to be looked at with less respect than the 2015 Warriors or the 2019 Raptors oh, something along those lines, a title is a title, I get it but people do look at these things, not all titles are created equal which is why you still here jokes years later about ""Durant not having a real ring"" , this shit matters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Hey man, I have a question!   Have you ever actually watched Kawhi Leonard play the game of basketball? Like, ever?"
"Nah, 0% chance the Suns lose this series. Devin Booker is the best player in the world right now, it won't matter if Kawhi Leonard comes back they are losing in 6 either way."

&gt;Kawhi Leonard has been upgraded ...   Its over.
Giannis a real team player going back to the bench to support his teammates unlike Kawhi ‚ÄúLoad management only plays 35 games a year‚Äù Leonard
"Was he a superstar when he won that ring in Toronto? Sure.   But he was still a plug and play character on that team. We all knew that Kawhi wasn‚Äôt staying in Toronto, it was just where he‚Äôd been sent for the time being after things erupted in San An. That ring was integral to Kyle Lowry for being the face of the franchise and second option on the team, it was integral to DeMar DeRozen by virtue of the fact that he was sacrificed in order for Toronto to make the run, and it was integral to Siakam‚Äôs ‚Äúarrival‚Äù.   He‚Äôs a great player, and he deserves all the credit that he earned for contributions made to those 2014 and 2019 title teams. It just seems he hasn‚Äôt won a ring that‚Äôs distinctly ‚Äúhis‚Äù. Winning one with the Clippers would definitely change that, I think, but with how PG13 has stepped up in his absence even if he makes it back in time for a Finals matchup should the Clippers win the conference, you pretty much have to ask if Kawhi‚Äôs the true number one of the team or if the Clippers have the most of a 1a/1b situation that we‚Äôve probably seen since Magic and Kareem. Most contending teams that would have to go the amount of games without their number one option that the Clippers have played without Kawhi would usually have been eliminated by now. I definitely think that Frank and West should consider building around PG more so than Leonard going forward considering the nature of the ailment his legs are suffering from."
"LAC vs PHO 3-3  Game 7  Kawhi Leonard is available to play  36minutes 30pts, 11 rebounds, 5 assists  Clippers lost."
"Nah, fuck kawhi Leonard"
"Imagine using Cam Payne who is playing on a bum ankle as an excuse when the Clippers have been without KAWHI LEONARD and Ibaka all series and now Zu, who is our only quality big man that can match Ayton's size"
You think Luka Doncic in his second and third year was gonna take down Paul George and Kawhi Leonard without his Scottie? Jordan had the same route Bucks-Celtics-Celtics 1st round and then Pistons b2b before making the Finals
Kawhi Leonard fits the bill.
"Charles Barkley, Kawhi Leonard"
"Kawhi Leonard is actually boring as hell and doesn't care much. I find it hard to root for a guy who looks like he doesn't want to be on the court all the time. It is inexcusable for him to miss out games all the time, when other players are injured, they sit on the bench with their team, work with the coaches, motivate their guys etc. Kawhi doesn't even bother, and he never seems to be excited about his teammates successes. He's a great player, but he is nothing of a leader or team guy."
Kawhi ‚ÄúWillis Reed‚Äù Leonard is gonna make 2 shots &amp; fire up the team
"I can see that you're not blaming players for this, but for anyone who thinks players (or even just stars) should try to stay in one place, remember what they did to DeMar DeRozan, a perennial all-star starter, beloved by the fan base, coming off a year where he became a plus defender, averaged 28 ppg, and improved his 3 pointer as well while leading the team (along with Lowry) to the 1st seed (although in the East, and although no one really thought they were going to come out of the East over the Cavs and Celtics, still an accomplishment). They traded him for an injure Kawhi Leonard. Obviously, Kawhi was a big addition for the Raptors, but they used that DeRozan was underpaid, since he'd taken a loyalty discount when he could have made more money for the Lakers close to home, and because that made his contract more valuable, they were also able to get Danny Green. They treated him like a stepping stone, an asset. So don't expect players to trust the franchises beyond exactly what the contract says.  See also, Isaiah Thomas."
"I'm just utterly confused by whatever the fuck you were trying to say. Like, are you saying we're bailed out of taking criticism because Zubac went out? Cuz spoiler alert, he's our backup. Only playing because the starter, Ibaka, is hurt. And so is this one dude named Kawhi Leonard.   So what in the everloving fuck are we ""bailed out"" from, when we've already been overachieving like crazy?"
Kawhi Leonard has maybe 2-3 years left before retirement.
"wdym? Thats exactly what happened, whats happening in LA is pure speculation, But in the spurs this was confirmed to be the case:  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/23/16693304/kawhi-leonard-trade-rumors-history-timeline-spurs-gregg-popovich"
"&gt;And Kawhi Leonard might not play the finals!  That is correct, if the Suns win this series, Kawhi will DEFINITELY not play the Finals."
"We can slightly alter this stats and say. The only 2 players in playoff history to drop 40+ on 72 FG%, 50 3PT%, 100 FT% are Kawhi Leonard in game 6 vs Dallas and PG13 in game 5 vs Suns"
Just admit that CP3 is playing like shit man. Kawhi Leonard is way more valuable than him. They‚Äôre also missing Ibaka and Zubac.
"His play in the 2nd half of game 7 with an injured leg, Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard hounding him, and Tim Duncan giving help D, made me a believer."

"Lol, okay. That means anything. Kawhi Leonard and a slough of other dudes had to go to that Raptors team to put them over the edge from being in that constant upper Eastern Conference  tier to going to the finals and becoming champions. That‚Äôs no disrespect to them, but without Leonard, Gasol and a much improved Siakam, that team would still be where Philly is today. Just being really, really good. Again, no disrespect, everyone needs a good team around them, but lots of dudes in the NBA are champions who don‚Äôt compare to CP and there are even more Hardens and Lillards and Embiids who are on the same HOF level who haven‚Äôt won anything. A single championship doesn‚Äôt immediately make you better than anyone. Lol. Lowry struggled to start the first 5-6 years of his career while CP was leading crappy Hornets teams to the playoffs. Sheez luiz. You‚Äôve got to be kidding. One is a clear HOFer and the other is Kyle Lowry who won‚Äôt sniff the HOF. My goodness."
How is Trae &gt; Luka? Trae beat a regular season Knicks team and the Sixers (same team that got swept by the Celtics mind you) who‚Äôs number two was Ben Simmons. He‚Äôs about to get crushed by Milwaukee. Doncic has gone up against... hmm lemme see  Kawhi Leonard 2xDPOY 2xFMVP Top 5 player  Paul George 7x All Star 4x Def Team 6x ALLNBA    Trae Young never faced that level of competition
"Pop would have outcoached Vogel.  And no way PG is carrying them with Lance Stephenson, Roy Hibbert, George Hill, etc vs Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard...  Spurs would have won in 5 or 6 each series."
"Lmao ok. I‚Äôd rather see Kawhi Leonard in the finals than Kevin Huerter, but you do you"
"I mean of course it‚Äôs kawhi leonard lol.  I think the Suns win game 6, but it‚Äôs definitely going to be tough, all games have been."
"&gt;this won't backfire at all, time to bet Suns by 30  He got them to a game 6 without 3 starters and kawhi leonard who had the highest PER in the playoffs before he went down. Win or lose, these guys are competing."
Imagine what would happen if tomorrow we get a report from Woj saying ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard has been upgraded to questionable for Game 6‚Äù
Lol look at all the clippers haters using up all the excuses in the book Kawhi  Leonard hasn‚Äôt even touched the court yet keep crying
because it's 2x Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard  Reggie Jackson will never scare me more than that idgaf
Have fun Blowing a 3-1 lead to a kawhi Leonard less clippers. How sad
On the thinnest of margins this could be the Clippers going up 3-2 in the series or winning the west 4-1 without Kawhi Leonard for the whole series and now without Zubac.   How much more evidence do y‚Äôall nephews need the Suns are nothing but frauds?
"if kawhi leonard was there, this would have been a sweep"
Kawhi Leonard must be going insane right now
How many medical staffs will Kawhi Leonard be unhappy with?
"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Acting Credits according to IMDB: Mannix, Game of Death, Emergency, Man from Atlantis, Airplane, Laugh-In, Tales from the Darkside, Fletch, Diff'Rent Strokes ... 38 in total lifetime.  Kawhi Leonard: 0. He has never acted in a movie or television show in his entire life.  That's what it looks like when someone doesn't like the media. Your posts are terrible."
"&gt; it forces them to play both ends of the court the right way  I agree with this. The Clippers switch all lineups were amazing with Leonard and they were clearly playing the most playoff prepared basketball out of anyone in the league when they did this. BUT, like I said its not sustainable for 48 minutes especially when you're short handed.  &gt;entire generations of NBA families who have plagued the NBA with awful decisions  Again, I agree with this, but I don't think Lue of all people should be the target of this criticism, he's one of the most modern coaches out there. There's also a lot more to coaching than just tactics and analytics. Keeping players happy is vital the function of a roster.  &gt;guys like Rondo and Cousins who are both the exact opposite of what you want at their positions  Rondo and Cousins have only played in very select spots. Without Kawhi the Clippers are down to two passable halfcourt shot creators (PG and Reggie). It's not the worst thing to try some old school tactics even if they are in small bursts. The Suns defence is elite but it has some holes and Cousins just put up 10 points in the first half for a team that is desperate for offence."
Kawhi Leonard is going crazy!
Tbh i think PG has better chemistry and enjoys playing with Reggie Jackson than Kawhi Leonard.
If Kawhi Leonard was going crazy the other night what the hell is this crowd doing
"Imagine if the Clippers made free throws in games 2, 4 OR had a guy like Kawhi Leonard on the team!!"
You say your a bad matchup and that y‚Äôall are still better than this team who has been super competitive without Kawhi Leonard so like yeah you gave props but...not really

Kawhi Leonard is going crazy
"I‚Äôll answer it for you.  Never.  It‚Äôs pretty clearly a fluke when Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray all miss playoff games due to injury for the first time in their careers."
or maybe Kawhi just hates doctors.   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/27/rumor-kawhi-leonard-unhappy-with-clippers-medical-staff/
"Kyle Lowry   Vince Carter   Kawhi Leonard   Chris Bosh   Jonas Valanciunas     Bench : Derozan, T-Mac, M.Gasol, VanVleet, Siakam"
"Clutch *minutes*, or clutch *scoring*?  Because that's not really the same thing, anybody who played in the last 5 minutes of a 5 point game is playing in clutch minutes.  That just means you guys played a bunch of tight games.  Because Kawhi Leonard isn't walking through that door.  Masai realized that you can't just float by on being good enough, that's why he traded Demar for Kawhi."
"Since 2010, and Tim Duncan isn't even mentioned in this thread? He helped win a chip and went to 2 finals in this time span. Ayton played in 1 playoffs so far and Tim Duncan isn't even mentioned... ok? Sure he was aged, but he was still capable. He off-loaded most of the offense to the other 2 in the trio on top of a rising Kawhi Leonard. PPG isn't everything, Timmy added massive value to Spurs earlier in this decade. In the short time span Timmy played since 2010-2011, during the regular season he had 200 more blocks than KAT has had in his career."
This is a bit tin foil hat time but my answer is:  Kawhi Leonard  Him sitting in the luxury box and not traveling with the team is a red flag for me.   If he says he wants to opt out and not return the Clippers could either lose him for nothing or sign and trade him to GS.
"I don't know man, are you sure.  I'm not 100% sure that Toronto's current roster is much better than ""maybe they could win a playoff series if the bracket breaks right"", and I'm not sure there is another Kawhi Leonard type trade out there.  Masai doesn't really strike me as the type of guy who is fine playing for first round exits.  You might be headed towards a rebuild."
"The Suns are the winners of the injury sweepstakes.  Lakers: Injured LeBron and AD getting injured.  Nuggets: No Jamal Murray  Clippers: No Kawhi Leonard, who was having one of the best playoffs performances of all time before he went down.  ""Winners Reward"" haha. Yeah the Suns are winners alright."

"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"

Of players who have played at least 48 games this year, Anunoby ranked 14th in isolation defense, immediately behind Kawhi Leonard. While being in the 94th percentile is impressive, it's Anunoby's versatility that makes him truly special in isolation. Of players with a minimum of 2000 possessions, Anunoby led the NBA this season in Versatility, a stat created by Krishna Narsu that attempts to measure how often a player defends different positions.

Who the hell knows with Kawhi though? He gives no impression either way, he's utterly unknowable."
Weird how you whine and moan about CP3s injured should but never even brought up LeBron playing on a twice injured ankle.  Once again comparing losing CP3 to Kawhi Leonard is straight delusional.

Now it's impossible for me to like them for so many reasons  **Paul George** - dude saying so much dumb shit all the time, plus deluding the entire OKC and Indiana.  **Pat Beverly**  - I love his defense, but the guys never know when to shut the hell up, and plays very dirty, resulting in various injuries.  **Marcus Morris**  - Do I even have to say why this guy is an asshole?  **Boogie Cousins**  - Again, a complete asshole who can't keep his emotions. Should become a boxer instead of a basketball player if he likes to fight all the time.  **Patrick Patterson**  - just have bad memories of his time in Toronto. Never worked out, partied all the time, didn't care whatsoever.  **Kawhi Leonard**  - I know I should adore him for helping the Raptors get their first ring, he's not an asshole by any means, but holy fuck is that guy boring as hell. I respect that he prefers his game to speak for him, but it's hard to root for a guy who avoids any talk, and constantly looks like he just wants to go home."
"When you got guys like Zack Lavine instead of Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday instead of Steph Curry..."
"Get back to me when the Dame Blazers make the finals. Never said that they should become a development team for anyone. It's simply a fact that this team isn't winning a title and no player that can push them in the realm of true contenders are gettable unless they give up like 5 first rounders plus other assets, and that player has to be keen on coming to Portland in the first place. Getting swept by their opponents missing their 1A/1B player in the WCF is not contending, lol.  And if you think that list is debatable, make a post asking the sub whether they think Dame is better than any of the 7 players listed first. Steph Curry and Kawhi Leonard are in no one's but homer rankings worse than Dame. The ""unreliable"" Curry won the scoring title this season while placing 3rd in MVP voting, better than anything Dame's done in his entire career."
No no no no. I've said being the face of the league requires personality and skill. He has the skill easily. Just like Kawhi Leonard has the skill in basketball as well as KD. The problem is that you need personality and some people consider being able to speak the language as part of the personality factor.
The next generation is too young to even know Ohtani well. You don't become anointed face of the league it just happens lol. Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan could never be the face of the NBA and that's fine. Ohtani could or couldn't be the face of the league but it isn't surprising that someone thinks he needs to speak english nor is it racist.
Kawhi has basically started 150 fewer games than Dame for his career and this hurts him in something like the HOF probability calculation since that looks at how often a player finishes top 10 in various counting stats. Kawhi is unique in that he's been so good despite rarely playing full seasons in his prime.  Kawhi Leonard has only started 66+ games twice in his ten year career. Dame's done it every one of his nine seasons in the league.
Kawhi leonard scoffs at the fact luka gets the preferential treatment of having 1 more game
kawhi leonard winning finals mvp and being second best is interesting

You feel you know what Kawhi Leonard plans on doing? Huh.
"Assuming they retain Kawhi Leonard on a 5-year deal, next season wouldn't be boom or bust for them necessarily."
Made for Fit and in the Modern NBA? I'm assuming everyone is Healthy and In their Primes.  PG: Stephen Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Kevin Durant C: Tim Duncan  Coach By Pop.  If the Opposition goes big to body them up they run their shooters off screens and play the pick and roll with Steph and Timmy (who's a fantastic passer off the short roll as well); If they try to go small to keep up Tim gets fed in the post all game surrounded by shooters he'll makes the right play out of doubles and then they can swing like the Spurs from 2014. Everybody's Clutch and they can all shoot and score from all 3 levels (4/5 can post up too on mismatches).  Defensively they'd be great with two elite wings on ball and Tim Duncan giving orders from the backline. There isn't anyone they opponents could pick on except maybe Steph but then they'd have to hit a tough shot over Duncan or KD or pass out with Klay and Kawhi ball hawking.  These are all guys who are proven to like each other and play well together we've seen it work already for 8 Chips in this century. Pop can manage egos and The Big Fundamental will lead them on court.
"For arguments sake, it‚Äôs not that he had no faith in him, it‚Äôs just that Kawhi fucking Leonard became available.  I genuinely believe he told Demar that he wouldn‚Äôt be traded because he didn‚Äôt want to blow up the team and he was certain that the Spurs would be more interested in other teams that would have been able to offer more draft picks and young stars like the Celtics or the Sixers.  Kawhi being available for Derozan was just a lightning in a bottle moment Masai couldn‚Äôt pass up."
"The chance is little to none, because I dont think DeMars family/friends would/should let him trust Masai again. But, its important to remeber that they had a moment in the bubble where they seemed to have made up similar to Pat Riley and Wade.  From Taylor Rooks bubble article:  &gt;Meanwhile, a few players used the new proximity to let go of old grudges. Raptors president Masai Ujiri said his favourite moment off the court happened while he was on the sidelines, watching his team play the Lakers, and one of his former players came up to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting down there, and I see this person walking straight to me with a blue tracksuit,‚Äù says Ujiri. It was DeMar DeRozan, who had spent nine seasons with the Raptors before he was traded to the Spurs for Kawhi Leonard. The trade had left DeRozan feeling ‚Äúextremely hurt‚Äù and betrayed but earned the Raptors the franchise‚Äôs first championship. ‚ÄúAnd he walks up to me,‚Äù Ujiri continues, ‚Äúand he gives me a big, big hug. This was really the first time that we‚Äôve really had that kind of contact since the trade. I left the game and I felt that we had crossed a certain‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd reached a new place.‚Äù"
"Dont know why youre getting downvoted, they literally hugged and made up in the bubble.

He won two literally the year after Duncan retired. He beat a Houston team coached by Mike D'Antoni and led by James Harden without Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker.
"Kawhi signed on to play for the 2020 team, he's just not playing because he's hurt. [At least get your facts straight](https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-02-10/lebron-james-kawhi-leonard-head-list-for-u-s-team-at-2020-olympics) [if you're gonna talk shit](https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/03/07/kawhi-leonard-olympics-gregg-popovich)"
No he should go to Indiana. Along with jokic and kawhi Leonard
"Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman were all in their mid 30s for the 98 championship.   Pop won his last with the big three in their mid 30s plus a young Kawhi Leonard playing finals MVP level basketball.   You can‚Äôt downplay that 14 Spurs team while ignoring that the Bulls didn‚Äôt have a single player in their prime for the end of the three peat. Shit, Scottie could barely play with his back injuries and was out there as a decoy half the time."
"Popovich sucks without Duncan or Kawhi like all coaches do without all-time talent. Larry Brown is the last NBA coach to win an NBA title without a superstar player, and I‚Äôm including Nick Nurse in Toronto with Leonard in the overrated club."
"PG: Steph Curry (2017)  SG: Kawhi Leonard (2016)  SF: LeBron James (2016)  PF: Larry Bird (1986)  C: Bill Russell (1962)  This is the 2017 Warriors on steroids. Curry = Curry; Kawhi &gt; Klay; LeBron &gt; Iggy; Bird &gt; KD; and Russell &gt; Draymond.  On offense, LeBron is surrounded by three elite 3-point shooters in Curry, Kawhi, and Bird. LeBron is one of the best passers/playmakers in NBA history, and he's the best skip passer in NBA history. The 2017 Cavs were one of the best post-season offenses in NBA history, and on this team LeBron is surrounded by better 3-point shooters than he had on that team. With this much space, there is no possible way to keep LeBron out of the paint. Moreover, I have another top 10 passer/playmaker in NBA history in Bird. The shooting and passing on this team is utterly absurd. With LeBron controlling the offense surrounded by probably the two best off-ball players in NBA history (Bird and Curry), there's no way to guard this team.  On defense, I have DPOY Kawhi and Bill Russell, who is the best defender in NBA history. And because Russell is an athletic freak he's perfectly suited to guard perimeter players on switches. LeBron himself is a top 5 SF defender in NBA history, and in the 2016 Finals, he had one of the best defensive series for a wing in NBA history. And he's the 3rd best defender on this team. Kawhi locks down anybody on the perimeter, Russell locks down anybody in the post, and LeBron plays free safety.  This team has on-ball offense, off-ball offense, 3-point shooting, lockdown defenders on the wing and in the post, passing/playmaking, and switchable defense. GG."
Kawhi Leonard has STILL not missed a 4th quarter field goal in a win during this year's playoffs. [Breakdown](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o1pnli/kawhi_leonard_has_still_not_missed_a_4th_quarter/)
PG LeBron James   SG Michael Jordan  SF Kawhi Leonard  PF Larry Bird   C Hakeem Olajuwon  I wanted two way players so I put in Kawhi over Curry for defense and versatility against another all-time team. Curry can't guard a Michael Jordan or another Stephen Curry.
"You‚Äôre right. Y‚Äôall really shutdown Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard."
"I kinda wonder if getting pretty much the best or top 3 best in every position was the way to make the best team ever or if you formed a team with more guys that will inevitably be 3th, 4th, and 5th options. Maybe Something like Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Scottie Pippen, and Bill Russell might be better or something like that."
"[https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kawhi-leonard/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kawhi-leonard/)  I'm with you on this. The Pacers wouldn't have drafted the next Mbah a Moute or Gerald Wallace. The projections were dead wrong. But that's what they were...  &gt;Does not have one aspect offensively that stands out or which allows him to consistently score the ball ‚Ä¶ With his size and frame, will almost certainly be a perimeter player at the next level, but he lacks the polish and skill necessary to consistently operate on the wing ‚Ä¶ He does not have break down ability off the dribble and he is especially shaky handling the ball with his left hand ‚Ä¶  His jumpshot (while definitely improved) is still very inconsistent ‚Ä¶ The release comes high off his head and it is somewhat of a sling motion, which results in a fairly flat shot that goes all over the place"
"What an awful comparison Kawhi Leonard was the best scorer and defensive player in that finals. Bridges isn‚Äôt close to that    Kawhi 2014 is the most underrated finals MVP ever by far. People on the internet act like he was Bruce Bowen out there just hitting open threes and playing good D.    Nah he was the best scorer on that team and had absolutely insane efficiency, he was an excellent rebounder for them and he was already the best wing defender in the league at that point."
"Kawhi Leonard in 2014 is in a similar vain.  On paper, 18 PPG and 2 APG while holding his assignment to 28 PPG on 68 TS% doesn't seem like a Finals MVP performance, especially when you look at Games 1 &amp; 2.  He really unlocked another gear after Pop talked to him before Game 3, but ultimately he won the award because he was the best scorer on the winning team, and capable of guarding LeBron without needing help on every possession."
"He is an awesome player who can play a strong role on a championship team or be the best player on a mid level team. I have not yet seen him be the best player on a contender, but Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard and others  have built themselves up to that point."
Kawhi Leonard
"On paper, Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green for Demar, Poetl and a pick is terrible for the Spurs"
Let me tell you a little story about George Hill and Kawhi Leonard.
Beginning to see why Dennis Rodman seems to be the only player that dislikes him.  Even Stephen Jackson and Kawhi Leonard seem to be on good terms with Pop despite professional disagreements.
"Just saw the downvotes. I guess I‚Äôm right again. And I mean I don‚Äôt know. Luka was scoring 40 a game and took a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to 7 games by himself. Giannis puts up 40+ against a team led by an out of prime, CP3 and a not yet in prime, Booker and he still loses by double digits. The evidence is right in front of you but if you choose to shut your eyes we can‚Äôt help you"
Whichever team has Kawhi Anthony Leonard
"Ingles used to be a good defender, but age caught up to him. Bogdanovic only plays  good defense when he's matched up with Kawhi Leonard for some odd reason. Conley played good defense this year, but he really shouldn't have even played in game 6 given his condition.  Mitchell is the one where I do think laziness plays a big part in his defensive deficiencies. He's young and athletic, but he simply cannot stay in front of anyone. I think all those years playing with Gobert taught him some bad habits."

"\-Coach Kawhi Leonard, 2035"
"Your argument makes no sense at all. Partially injured stars? AD dominated games 2 and 3, had 34 back to back and put the Lakers up 2-1 in the series. Game 4 he strained his groin and was done for the season and the suns proceed to win 3 straight blowouts. Then they played the ENTIRE clipper series without Kawhi fucking Leonard. A top 5 superstar player.  Also the clips took the suns to 6 games, 2 of which were insanely close that could‚Äôve gone either way. Like without that Ayton .6 second game winner that series is going 7 games. And again that‚Äôs all with them missing kawhi, ibaka, and zubac. Honestly even being taken to 6 games by the crippled clips is just as embarrassing as bucks being taken to 7."
"It's probably going to take a while for me to dig up the article, considering:   1. Kawhi often appears ""in court"" due to his job 1. Kawhi had a much more notable court battle with Nike recently 1. It wasn't a major story for him specifically, just a listed reason for him missing a game with the Spurs  If you want to believe I made up an obscure and not especially remarkable fact to bolster my point that Kawhi's inner circle is suspect, that's totally up to you.  I suppose it would've been easier to reference that Kawhi's sister [may have murdered an 84-year-old woman](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/us/kawhi-leonard-sister-charged/index.html)."

"Ah I remember these takes about Kawhi Leonard.   Dude he‚Äôs the 3rd option on a stacked offense. The fuck do you expect? Of course he‚Äôs not averaging 20+. If he goes elsewhere and becomes the primary option, I‚Äôm 100% positive he‚Äôll take the next step."
"Fully healthy either one of those teams would be in the finals absolutely no question about it, any arguments are delusional, absolutely no way the Suns survive the lakers size and depth in the paint, and absolutely no way the Suns survive a healthy kawhi Leonard on both ends of the floor"
And Kawhi Leonard is going crazy

"2019 kawhi was huge in defeating 76ers (iconic 4 bounce game winner) and the bucks. Its not just about the finals his whole playoff run was crazy good in 2019.  When kawhi was on luka, especially in the final game against dallas when he guarded luka down the stretch it was clear that it slowed luka down. You dont want kawhi guarding him all game cause 1. Kawhi has a decent offensive load himself and 2. You dont want him in foul trouble.  Tbh I thought kawhi played fine in that denver series he had a bad game 7 but overall he played pretty adequately.   Steph is amazing but kawhi leonard plays both sides of the ball and that is why I tip the scale in kawhi favor. Steph is more prolific scoring threat but I dont know if that makes him better than a guy who is exceptional on both sides of the ball. And if im being honest curry's size kinda limits how great he can be its not his fault but being smaller makes him easier to manhandle and slow down. Steph is still my favorite player but I can be objective about where I place him in the hierarchy of the NBA."
"A lot of reports indicated that [Brandon Ingram was on the trade table per Woj](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks) but they wanted more. So, it would have been Ingram + a bunch of first round picks.  They wanted more. If negotiations were done in good faith, it probably would have been based around Ingram. Even if the Spurs had no interest in Lonzo, it's not like he couldn't have been an additional trade asset for the Spurs.  And a package of Randle + Kuzma + picks may not have been better than what they got from Toronto, but you were trying to say that we were like ""Kuzma + picks"" when, in reality, a lot of us were anticipating Brando being moved and being the primary catalyst of a trade package."
"Party? Dallas just made August 6th ""Kawhi Leonard Day""."
"The 2016 spurs were so weird. They had a lineup consisting of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green, Patty Mills, etc. and didn't even finish first in their conference with 67 wins."
"Time is running out. Kawhi Leonard is still in his prime but for how long given how injury prone he is. Paul George has shown signs of being a superstar, but when it comes down to the wire, he seems to crumble under the pressure."
Lol I guess Steve Nash is better than Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi leonard: I want to go to LA. My family lives there and it is my hometown   *Spurs trade kawhi to Toronto*  Sports media: hey kawhi do you want to make any indication that you want to stay here long term?   Kawhi leonard: No thank you!   *signs with LA clippers, builds and moves into  expensive  house in LA, all reports point to him staying and have been since like 2020*  But yeah this mysterious man of mystery sure wants mysterious things."
Peak Tim Duncan and 2019 Raptors Kawhi Leonard

"Kawhi Leonard, Kemba Walker, Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson... They're assembling the 2011 draft class!"
"&gt; Flair bias aside, I absolutely think it would.   Then why didn't they draw better than other teams in the earlier rounds?  &gt; Probably not but both teams have enough superstar power that it would have a decent draw  They don't though. Nobody outside of more serious NBA fans know who Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, and James Harden are. They are on the same level as Chris Paul and Giannis in terms of star power.  Lebron is really the only ""superstar"" the NBA has. You can see it in the ratings. Lakers - Warriors play in did 5.6 million viewers. Warriors - Memphis did 3.6.  Steph Curry is probably the second most popular NBA ""superstar"" and even he doesn't have the star power to pop the ratings."
Kawhi leonard if your not a Spurs fan
"I think Clippers would be better with Kawhi Leonard playing, you disagree?"
"Probably would have averaged more or performed better overall if they weren‚Äôt missing their best player, you may have heard of him Kawhi Leonard."
"Guys, its Dario Saric. Like, damn wasn't it convenient enough Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, &amp; Kawhi Leonard went down? Gotta go through some trial &amp; tribulations."
They should hire Kawhi Leonard too
"Fans of other teams, would hypothetically swapping CJ for Kawhi Leonard make Portland the favorite?   Dame / Powell / Kawhi / Covington / Nurkic, plus let‚Äôs say a decent bench"
The Jazz couldn't beat a Clippers team missing Kawhi Leonard late in the series as the #1 seed and the Suns don't survive the first round if Anthony Davis doesn't get hurt.   The networks need to hype the squads with the best chance to win it all.
TJ Warren looks like if you tried to draw Kawhi Leonard from memory
"They're good enough to, it's just that Kawhi Leonard seemingly can't stay healthy."
"From my anecdotal experience (I live in Toronto), a LOT of Raptors fans don't have a soft spot for Kawhi, and many dislike him for what he pulled during his free agency.  I think Chris Paul will be far more beloved in Pheonix than Leonard in Toronto, and CP3 doesn't seem dumb enough to throw championships away just to go chill in his hometown for 1 or 2 years."
"If the discussion is about how the suns got to be a 2 seed and a finals team after winning 19 games and ppl want to talk about Kawhi Leonard, then yea I‚Äôll tune that part out"
"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed ‚ÄúPlayoff Rondo‚Äù.  KCP: ‚ÄúBinary Mamba‚Äù for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers‚Äô Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe‚Äôs word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers ‚Äúain‚Äôt the one‚Äù. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become ‚Äúwashed‚Äù. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to ‚Äúgood‚Äù teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, ‚Äúto continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation‚Äù. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. ‚ÄúFOR KOBE‚Äù is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets‚Äô bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a ‚Äúmickey mouse ring‚Äù or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  ‚ÄúJob‚Äôs not done‚Äù  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
Suns are def stacked but relax Clips didn‚Äôt have Kawhi Leonard
"Don't think so dude, that team had an amazing defense, and Kawhi Leonard on a roll.  You forget guys like FVV and Siakam were on a roll too.  And they didn't even have OG."
This makes no sense. You skipped Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard. Are you fing dumb?
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who‚Äôs good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
"the easiest way is probably to not try to catch-up, but to get into the major storylines that are happening right now and older stuff will fill in with time.  basically from 1999-2010 it was pop and the spurs vs kobe and the lakers. the pistons won one in that period with one of the best defensive teams of all time, dwade carried the heat to one, and the celtics brought in garnett/ray allen and got one.  2010-2020 was basically lebron vs the warriors. lebron went to miami and created the big 3 with wade and bosh, but lost in their first year. they won the next two, and then lost the threepeat to the spurs on the final run of duncan's career. the next 4 seasons were cavs vs warriors, with the warriors winning 3 but lebron getting the 3-1 comeback against what was supposed to be the best team of all time. kawhi leonard wins one for the raptors the next year in a surprise run, then last year lebron wins one with the lakers."
He clearly doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a reason people are already comparing Hunter to Kawhi Leonard. And he‚Äôs so young too after the Hox not even making the bubble last year. Such raw incredible talent in limited games so far because of unfortunate injuries and the bubble.
"I'd pay good money to have Woj tweet a mention for me on the day that I die  Something like ""r/NBA lurker and Mavericks fan u/cypherdust has passed away at the age of X. He was most notably known for picking up Kawhi Leonard from DFW airport in his Kia Rio when Leonard signed with the Dallas Mavericks when Free Agency opened on August 2nd, 2021."""
"By that logic every single individual defensive matchup would be meaningless. But i guess you have to believe that watching bron bron play defense for the last couple of years.  And it isn't like Kawhi Leonard is one DPOY or anything. That was just him getting lucky, no casual link between being a one of kind defender and playing good defense. Just total random variance."
Kawhi Leonard
"The Suns looked great all of their playoff run, more on average then the Clippers even with Kawhi, definitely facts since the Clippers had some games where they just looked flat where the Suns were always competitive.  The Clippers looked like they started to click at a higher peak than the Suns in terms of dominance from that Mavs series.  Down 0-2 and they go back to LA and win 2 in dominating fashion against the #1 seed.  They looked like a monster with PG and Kawhi having 30+ games 3 games in a row.  I think thats why more people jumped on that thought process and hype train of picking the Clippers.  They looked like they became what people expected and looked hard to beat for the Suns.  But yeah I think the Suns earned some respect from people.  They won in a lot of ways and continue to do so.  If Kawhi remained healthy and both teams on a roll like that, I would bet my money on Kawhi Leonard over CP3 be honest.  Just my two cents.  The guy looked like 2019 Leonard vs the 76ers in the ECSF."
"This is why I hate media, sports media in particular. It's narrative driven. Propaganda. Rarely it is ever about facts.  Deadspin had the story, they buried it. Someone must have caught wind that someone else picked up the story and this was the response.   I don't think Rachel is racist but alot of people do. I just think it was tone deaf. This is probably not much of a story if she didn't say she was a token hire.  But I think the response in painting Maria Taylor whomever is doing that, I think that's pretty racist. This woman is the media kawhi Leonard. She don't talk or say nothing out of turn. No one has ever heard that. Now she's asking for face of ESPN money? Come on. Who believes that shit."
"&gt; It‚Äôs not brutal when comparing it to league average. Isn‚Äôt Kyle Lowry the best rap of all time, multi time all star, leader? What‚Äôs he doing just below league average?  He had a drop off from his regular season. Like I said before and agreed with. Which I didn't deny. I am saying it is wrong to call it brutal. Drop offs from the regular season to playoffs aren't something that only happen to Lowry, and they are more common for small guards. Are all Pacers fan this delusional or something? Or are yall just dumb.  &gt; Lol these guys will say anything to defend A rap.  If saying 0.6% below league average true shooting isn't brutal and that Lowry does have drop offs from his regular season into the playoffs is defending a Raptor, then whatever. But it ain't. I literally agreed with you about his drop off.  &gt; Just today you had OG as the second coming of Kawhi. Lmao L that  What's funny is, we didn't call OG the next Kawhi one of his player comparisons going into the draft was actually Kawhi Leonard. You know, before he ever was drafted by the Raptors. You know, by American draft scouts like Draft Express and American media like ESPN. So hold another L my guy."
"Not really, Raptors have at least two. Kawhi Leonard is a lock for HOF, and Marc Gasol is a lock thanks to his international career in addition to his NBA career. Kyle Lowry probably doesn't make it, but there's a chance given how easy it is to get in."
"Oh it can definitely happen again. It's happened twice in the last 2 years. We blew up 3-1 lead and 2-0 leads in the playoffs two years in a row. Quin needs to seriously look himself in the mirror and decide whether that defense with relying on Rudy to cover everybody else's mistakes is good enough for the playoffs. IMO it's obviously not. It's really easy for Quin in the regular season. He invests close to no time and preparation on it, Rudy is just this good and has repeatedly shown that he can elevate a bad defensive team into one of the top teams in the league... at least in the regular season.   But in the playoffs all the weaknesses get targetted and exposed. And IMO it's fair to say that this defense is not going to cut it. There are just too many weaknesses outside of Rudy and the core of this roster is to a large degree set for the foreseable future so you will have to make schematic changes IMO. Just an example - MKE had one of the better defenses in the league in previous years(BTW similar defense to ours with dropping the big in the paint)... but that didn't cut it in the playoffs... so what did they do this year? They started switching more and mixing in other coverages and it has helped them in the playoffs. Maybe it cost them several wins in the regular season while working out the kinks, but it was probably worth it. IMO we need to do the same thing and try to practice other ways of stopping teams. We need to have options available when a team adjusts.   This is just one thing... we need better defensive perimeter talent too. Our backcourt is extremely small with both Conley and Mitchell being 6'1""... Bojan is not quick and athletic enough and Ingles has not been good defensively last 2 playoff years either. We need athleticism and defensive ability on the perimeter. Be it through the draft or through FA/trade. We definitely need help there. This is the FO's job. And now that Dennis Lindsey has paid the price for his bad decisions last two years, a new FO will have its shot at completing the roster too. Hopefully with players that Quin actually wants(there are reports that DL and Quin didn't see eye to eye on some of the most important acquisitions the last 2 years(Favors, Azebuike).   We need improvements from our players too... I don't know how much better Gobert can get... but Mitchell definitely has a step further he can take. Maybe some of our young bench guys can take a step forward(Oni, Brantley, Forest, Hughes).... but yeah...   That's the thing. This team is largely set when it comes to the core. I don't think there will be any major changes(unless Conley doesn't resign I guess.. which is possible, but even then we don't have many avenues to address that and we will have to address it internally most likely). There still are avenues for this team to get better, though... and again, lets not forget this was the best regular season team in the NBA this year. They are not starting from a low platform here. Hell, they even took 2-0 lead against a Clippers team that actually had Kawhi Leonard. They just couldn't respond when the Clippers made changes about the way they were attacking our defense. So now it's on all levels of this team to make the team better - FO, coaching staff, players... we need to get better, but it's likely this will be a good playoff team next year again... and we will see if they've made the required improvements when that time comes.   Apologies for the long post - **tl;dr - yes, this could definitely happen again, and it's the responsibility of everybody on the team from FO, to coaching staff to players to make this team better, more versatile and more resilient in playoff settings.**"
OG Anunoby. He‚Äôs on the Kawhi Leonard trajectory and will have a massive breakout season this year
"Those picks only come good if Houston totally collaspe and Kawhi leaves the Clips this summer. Those are probable outcomes but the Thunder have to act now. Those picks won't hold a ton of value if Leonard stays. Moreover, the clock starts ticking as soon as Shai signs a max extension. The Thunder have to be good by 2025 to stop him from looking elsewhere. Only way to keep stars in small markets is winning. Future can be equally great and crap, hard to say man honestly."
"You know, I've literally spent years arguing with Stockton fans about how longevity isn't better than peak, and have been told time and time again by fans on reddit that availability is the best abillity. CP3 has both the better peak all-time, more all-time peak seasons, and probably the most underrated ""longevity"" in the league (he's goten injured a lot but  he's been elite almost every season since 2008)   In CP3's case, he has more seasons that are all-nba tier than Leonard. He has almost double the career points and steals, 6 times the career assists and more career rebounds.   If we count Kawhi's truly elite seasons, he has 5 seasons where he was all-time great, CP3 has 10 at the very least and 12 if you count his last 2 seasons.  A 36 year old CP3 isn't having his best season ever or anything like that, he's just had a competent front-office for the first season (2nd including his first season with Houston) in his career. CP3 gets drafted by the Spurs and wins at least 1 ring as well. Never mind the fact that Kawhi's finals MVP was retconned into being something more than a ""passing of the torch"" type of award like it was at the time, arguably any player on the Spurs roster could've won it that season and it'd be considered fair enough.  He'd also never bitch out of a team like Kawhi did with the Spurs, but hurrdurr rangz I guess."
Cam Reddish - Paul George   DeAndre Hunter - Kawhi Leonard lite  Michael Porter Jr - Brandon Ingram  Patrick Williams - Jimmy Butler  Onyeka Okongwu - Lanky Serge Ibaka  RJ Barrett - Danny Granger  Kevin Porter Jr - Dollar Store Harden
"Stats are great but also need context. Rebound rate/percentage is just the percentage of missed shots he rebounded while on the court. It doesn't take into account where or how he plays. Kawhi Leonard isn't a horrible rebounder but he has 9.9 percent rebound rate. Brook Lopez isn't a chump and he only has an 8.6. You can drop numbers all you want but without context they don't mean anything. PJ Tucker, who is a very good rebounder has 7.3, which is lower than Ojeleye. I guess PJ Tucker is a worse rebounder than him according to your stats.  Also rebound rate and percentage are the same thing, they aren't two separate categories lol."
My dude you are buggin.  Lakers had Lebron AD and Kcp injured (their 3 best players )  Nuggets had Murray who had 50 point games last post season and MPJ injured.. 2 of their 3 best players..  And clippers had Kawhi fuckin Leonard AND serge ibaka injured..   No body can say suns were favorites in all those series with both sides fully healthy  You are straight up trippin I'm sorry

"That‚Äôs not impossible, especially after one of the recent draft picks is a 2/3 like Demar. I think Simmons could be rejuvenated in SA, especially with Chip Engelland fixing his shot. Chip did the same for both Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard. Problem is Morey‚Äôs crazy demands so far."
"Mikal Bridges has that Kawhi Leonard potential, he just needs to develop his offense and he could a perennial all star in a few years"
"this is arguably more impactful, but the raptors trading for kawhi leonard"
"I feel like I have been defending him on reddit for the past few weeks but here's the deal: he used to write features on NBA people for SI, and in that process writer spends time with his subject to get to know him, he said in his AMA he had drinks with Nick Nurse, for example, [and then wrote this story on him](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/10/25/raptors-nick-nurse-kawhi-leonard-masai-ujiri-kyle-lowry).  And he wrote a book about tanking where he interview bunch of NBA people. He obviously has NBA connections and is not making stuff up like Scoop B does.   I'm not saying he's Woj/ Shams tier, but he just started as a reporter and was first on Grizzlies/ Pelicans trade, Raptors drafting Barnes and bunch of news on assistant coaches hiring."

He was scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting in 10:36 in the fourth quarter specifically."
Kawhi Leonard .
"In no particular order and assuming that they keep the original 50.

"Scottie Barnes will be in the league for 5 years tops.  I actually have no idea but so far the mold of players with his scouting profile (long and athletic with a bad shot) have often not worked out.  Everyone thinks they‚Äôre getting Jaylen Brown/Kawhi Leonard, but just as often you get Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson"
"the heat are interested in every free agent  i dont know how they will pay bam, jimmy b, herro, duncan, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie, bradley beal, pascal siakam, and kawhi leonard but ive been wrong before"
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"
Scottie Barnes is the next kawhi Leonard
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
"100%, I‚Äôm actually not even sure why my previous comment is being downvoted. Siakam is probably a better defender than Bridges if they had similar offensive loads for sure, all im saying is that they have different strengths as defenders. Much like Kawhi Leonard and Rudy Gobert are different."
Yes. Kawhi Leonard at 15 - incredible pick. Kyle Anderson at 30 - great pick. Dejounte Murray at 29 - great pick. Derrick White at 29 - great pick. Keldon Johnson at 29 - great pick. We drafted an MVP caliber player and 4 starter level players while having no lottery picks until last year.
This time last year everyone was bitching that the Bulls reached on Patrick Williams and then by then end of the season he's drawing comps to Kawhi Leonard.   I'm an FSU alum and watched every game this year. Barnes is an athletic marvel with great basketball IQ and a clutch gene. I also don't think his shot is as broken as many are saying. You're going to be real happy with him this year just wait.
"Besides. I don‚Äôt mean to downplay rings. But in an era where superstars were all teaming up and jumping small market stats 4-on-1, Russ went about etching his name in the history books.   I make this argument for him to every one of my friends who have the ‚ÄúFacebook NBA fan logic‚Äù where 0 rings means you‚Äôre an absolute bum.   Beside Kawhi Leonard and the guys on the 2011 Mavs team, in the last 10 years. It‚Äôs been super team rings until this year for the Bucks (though not to discredit, but even they got some good fortune along the way).  In the last 10 years. 3 maybe 4 titles have been respectable. The other 6-7 have been teams stacked with laughably soft but amazing players with no heart. In the time all these sell outs were ‚Äúwinning‚Äù rings, Russ won an MVP, launches a signature shoe with Jordan and equaled arguably the most unbreakable record ever in averaging a triple double‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Then did it for 3 full seasons.   That‚Äôs basically better than anything that‚Äôs happened in this decade bar Curry‚Äôs unanimous MVP really."
"Right but if you *do* trust your development, the upside here is Kawhi Leonard. A franchise-defining player.  I'm not saying the Raptors have flawless drafting and development. They drafted Bruno Caboclo, Delon Wright and Jakob Poeltl with three straight first round picks. They get a lot of credit on the Anunoby pick but Anunoby was projected to go way higher before his injury so it wasn't really some galaxy brain draft decision to pick him up where he slid to.  I know Wright and Poeltl weren't total busts and, along with Caboclo, were picked late enough in the draft that it's easy to miss on your picks, but the Raptors do get maybe more than their share of the benefit of the doubt due to the success and development of players like Powell, Siakam and Van Vleet.  I'm always going to be nervous about them passing on Suggs until we know how good both Barnes and Suggs turn out to be. I'm just hoping they made the right decision here."
Dude that works for the team that had Kawhi Leonard has never seen a hand that big before?????
"Leonard in the finals was 15/42 , siakim was 5/21 , gasol was 6/19. Plus everyone of those guys you would almost rather them shoot the 3 then work it inside for a shot.  That's how good Leonard and siakim were in the lane and mid-range that year. Gasol is going to be open because of help off of screens and if you lose via him hitting 3s that's something you can live with. But you can see how besides Leonard, when the lights get brighter the 3 gets harder to hit. The shooting from Fred and Kyle are absolutely what helped them win the championship, I'm just trying to say that 1 guy that can't shoot the 3 ball isn't going to ruin your team especially when he can do so many other things well. Because Lebron is a career 34 percent and Davis is 31 percent from 3 with Davis being much better the last few years. So they aren't people that in theory hurt your spacing but they are like kawhi and siakim that you'd rather they shoot the 3."
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac

"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
This is some Kawhi Leonard shit.
I‚Äôve actually thought about this before. Worthy players to add IMO  LeBron James Kobe Bryant Tim Duncan Kevin Durant Kevin Garnett Dirk Nowitzki Dwyane Wade Stephen Curry Steve Nash Jason Kidd Allen Iverson Gary Payton Ray Allen Reggie Miller Dominique Wilkins (snubbed last time) Kawhi Leonard Chris Paul Vince Carter Paul Pierce Dwight Howard Carmelo Anthony Jason Kidd Tracy McGrady Chris Webber Yao Ming Bob McAdoo Tony Parker James Harden Giannis Antetokounmpo Russel Westbrook Alonzo Mourning Grant Hill
The plug took the team where we never been like Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi leonard, Paul George for rozier and filler. That‚Äôs my Final offer"
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
"Shamet has played for four different teams in his first four years.  He has played with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Devin Booker, and possibly Chris Paul."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2783443-lakers-trade-rumors-brandon-ingram-named-as-part-of-possible-kawhi-leonard-deal    This is their source and as expected it doesn't say anywhere close to what they think it says
"&gt; https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2783443-lakers-trade-rumors-brandon-ingram-named-as-part-of-possible-kawhi-leonard-deal  This is what I recall, Lakers didn't want to part with both BI and Kuz and Spurs asked for both."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2783443-lakers-trade-rumors-brandon-ingram-named-as-part-of-possible-kawhi-leonard-deal
"He‚Äôs usually used as a point guard in transition, where he runs down the court and finishes or creates for teammates. You‚Äôd want him to be used as a hyper-athletic point guard in the half court, like a Fox, Westbrook, or Wall, but he hates taking shots so he can‚Äôt really create much. Therefore he‚Äôs like a Ricky Rubio with the ball, and a normal dunking big man without the ball. On defense he‚Äôs most similar to peak Kawhi Leonard, a guy who shuts down ball handlers from 1-4 but doesn‚Äôt provide quite enough strength or rim protection to be a 5 like Draymond Green."
"Ah yes, Kawhi Leonard, the paragon of health. Who could have possibly seen that coming?   And the Suns would have beat the Nuggets anyway. It's not like that series was close. It was a 4-0 sweep with zero close games."
And Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard...
"Yeah, he reminds me of Kawhi Leonard early in his career; young, good contract, good defense, good 3pt% and offensive upside.  I'm not saying he's at all on the same level, but if his 3pt% is legit he's a perfect fit for the wolves atm and would probably be the same on most other teams in the league."
It's Kawhi Leonard. Hell no he isn't touching a basketball court until next summer. He barely touches the court when he's healthy
"Bad move by the Mavs  They should understand Kawhi by now  Look at what he did to the Spurs  Look at how he teased the Lakers  Kawhi is capable of being that guy  If I'm the Mavs, I completely ignore going for Kawhi and go for Lowry  I mean maybe, just maybe inquire about Leonard."
"just have kawhi leonard and have him break his body trying to carry you on both ends, its ez"
"Neither Barkley nor Leonard should be on the list.   There can be an argument made that Charles had most of his best seasons in the 5 years before the Suns trade. The dude was clearly still an MVP guy, but that trade didn't turn him into one, it just got him more team wins and media votes  As for Leonard, the big 3 were basically retired and Kawhi was already the dude, when Pachulia happened, and the idea that he could've achieved the same individual-excellence with the Spurs, that he did with the raptors, isn't particularly far fetched"
Dame would like one Kawhi Leonard on his team lol.
Lmao he avg‚Äôd 36 on 49% being guarded by kawhi Leonard in the playoffs I highly doubt switching from being guarded by kawhi to jrue knocks 10% of his efficiency
I always love his game so much. Tough mid range and strong athletic finisher. Can get buckets everywhere. Kinda like a kawhi leonard or a pf version of khris middleton
"The question is... how far into the bench would USA have to go to lose to the world's best?  Team 1 = Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar  Team 2 = Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Shaquille O'Neal  Team 3 = Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Wilt Chamberlain  Team 4 = Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Bill Russell  Team 5 = John Stockton, John Havlicek, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Moses Malone  Team 6 = Isaiah Thomas, James Harden, Scottie Pippen, Anthony Davis, David Robinson  Team 7 = Bob Cousy, Allen Iverson, Bob Pettit, Elvin Hayes, George Mikan  Team 8 = Russell Westbrook, Rick Barry, George Gervin, Dominique Wilkins, Bill Walton"
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
Your trade was effectively for PG + reigning finals MVP Kawhi Leonard too.
&gt;your $3000 gif of Kawhi Leonard  Lmaoooooo this cracked me tf up
"Draymond Green was literally a bench player his first 2 years at Michigan State. He even came off the bench for a few games in his 3rd year. Barnes just finished his freshman year at Florida State. If you know anything about how Leonard Hamilton plays at Florida State, he plays like 10 deep, full-court press, so it doesn‚Äôt really matter if you start or not. Terrance Mann didn‚Äôt even start until his senior year there, and now he‚Äôs going to be a full-time starter next year in the NBA with Kawhi out."
"Yes, the genuine master edition of a piece of physical art, hand crafted by a world class artist, put on display for all to view at internationally-acclaimed museums, is as useless as a short digital clip from a basketball game  Just because you don‚Äôt appreciate Mona Lisa the way other people do doesn‚Äôt make your $3000 gif of Kawhi Leonard somehow less of a garbage fucking thing to spend your money on lmfao"
"seeing a lot of cope honestly  siakam was broken against the g-league nets, i promise you celtics defense is not that good  missing hayward is not missing fucking jamal murray+lebron +james+kawhi leonard+anthony davis LMAO  we would not have played the nets in the first round if their guys were healthy anyway, use ur head"
"Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Jonathan Isaac, Marcus Smart, De,Aaron Fox and Paul George are all some of my favorite players. If you couldnt tell I enjoy watching good perimeter defense"
apparently not the person everyone assumed RDA was: https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/jeanie-buss-nephew-reddit-leaks-kawhi-leonard-free-agency-story/503826  tl;dr bunch of people linked the initials in the username with a legitimate nephew Jeanie had but there are some discrepancies based on the information RDA provided and what we know about the nephew. Unless RDA did a good job of intentionally making up random stuff about themself beforehand it most likely isn't the nephew.
"Yeah I don't think most players care that much about how the Demar situation played out. Look at the Clippers, stabbed Griffin in the back and their ""punishment"" was Kawhi Leonard leaving a championship roster for them and Paul George forcing a trade there.  Also, people act like free agents were lining up to sign with Toronto before the move."
Why does everyone think a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George coached by Ty Lue is gonna be complete dogshit? I don‚Äôt fucking get it.
Luka Doncic - Klay Thompson - Kawhi Leonard - Zion Williamson - PJ Washington.
"We're one piece away from a *decent* playoff run, if that piece is a LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, etc type of superstar/MVP-caliber forward. A superstar/MVP 5 like Jokic or Embiid could probably also move the needle.  But this team will struggle to make the playoffs even adding an all-star and will never sniff the conference finals with Luke Walton at the helm."
"Ah shit I had a whole response that I guess didn‚Äôt get through, my bad!  Alright so to respond to one thing: if you are saying you don‚Äôt think the gap between the overall USA talent pool and the rest of the world is huge, I just completely disagree. Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert are all star international players, but none of them have even a 2nd star on their roster. Their teams perform well in the olympics for that exact reasons- because they play together all the time and are actually a team. If you took Giannis off this years Bucks squad, and just ran their all american lineup of Middleton-Jrue-Brook Lopez- Connaughton- Pj Tucker, that team would dominate the Olympics. It‚Äôs just that this USA team had a really shortened window to practice because of Covid/ the NBA season being pushed back.  I don‚Äôt understand the point you are trying to make about Dame and KD. Yes they are superstar players, and while I don‚Äôt necessarily think Tatum will be as good as KD 4 years from now, it‚Äôs not at all crazy to think that some combination of 2 of any of these young USA guys will 4 years from now be as good as Dame/ KD. Also worth pointing out that the Olympic team is struggling in large part because Dame and KD are playing awful, so I don‚Äôt see the logic in saying a different version without them is automatically better.  Anyways, in a larger sense, if the USA sends a full or even semi full team in 2024, we will absolutely dominate. This years team is missing so many key guys: Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis‚Ä¶. which is literally maybe the best starting 5 we can roll out overall.  I‚Äôm not sure exactly what point you are trying to make. The USA is still by far the most talented Olympic team, despite how poorly we‚Äôve played, and you not seeing why a different team 4 years from now can be better than this does not make any sense to me. If that 2024 team develops and everyone wants to play, it could be an all time great roster. Who knows though, obviously just speculation at this point."

Demar could have led me to the finals in 2018 and I would still trade him for Kawhi Leonard lol  You are right tho since the trade was a bit risky due to being a one year rental and him coming off an injury
"This OP is an absolute shit take. Marcus Smart is averaging 13/5/3 after 7 seasons in the NBA Oubre was giving you 15/6/1 after 7 seasons in the NBA Murray providing 15/7/5 in 4 seasons.  Simmons numbers alone are a notch better than those other players, he is a better defender, and offensively, creates more in transition than any of these guys. 24/25 years old is still so young, and both Simmons and Murray have missed full seasons. After 4 seasons Kawhi Leonard averaged 16/7/2.  This is the reason that Murray and Simmons are worth more. They both still have the potential to be the next Kawhi. Smart and Oubre will likely continue to be rotation players with similar production.  I think the Spurs would swap any two players on their current roster for Ben Simmons without too much thought."
I'd rather have Zach Lavine than Kawhi Leonard
https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/17/report-kawhi-leonard-told-raptors-he-didnt-think-they-were-good-enough-to-repeat/amp/  Look it up. There‚Äôs reports everywhere
In a way he was but it took an all time playoff run from one of the best players in the league and an injured as hell warriors team to pull it off  Not letting Demar off the hook for some awful playoff performances or the 2018 sweep but its not his fault he wasn't as good as a red hot Kawhi Leonard
Luka when he isn‚Äôt guarded by Paul George and Kawhi Leonard.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free buckets‚Äù
OG as a rookie was untouchable for Kawhi Leonard lmao he is not getting traded for ben simmons
"They would beat a team with Curry on it. Everyone has to be solid on defense. Curry would be a swinging door and you can‚Äôt hide him. Not to mention you can hand and shoulder Check in FIBA 3x3.   I would replace Curry with Kawhi Leonard. Klay Thompson would be better in 3x3 than Curry  And I love Curry but his game is meant for NBA 5x5. He won‚Äôt have any space in 3x3. Guys like Kyrie, Trae, Damian Lillard and Chris Paul would also get exposed and do very very poorly in 3x3 too"
"No.  The rules are different and FIBA 3x3 is super fast paced. It‚Äôs non stop. There is no stoppage, no time outs. Those 40 year old retired players would have a heart attack after one game or tear an ACL or rupture an achilles   It‚Äôs also more physical. Hand checking is allowed. Even shoulder checking is not called. If a player has a weakness in their game, especially on defense, it will get exposed  If america wants to win gold in 3x3 in the Olympics, they‚Äôre going to need to send their best YOUNG players  Even then, guys like Steph Curry, Kyrie, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, etc would get EXPOSED. They‚Äôre not built for the 3x3 format. They would be complete liabilities on defense and they can‚Äôt be hidden. They would get hammered physically. James Harden and Chris Paul would have to ditch their foul-baiting and flopping ways since they wouldn‚Äôt get ANY calls  Lebron would adjust and adapt and do very well in 3x3. Kawhi Leonard would also be excellent. Kevin Durant might struggle with the physicality but the dude can still shoot over anyone so he would be a good pick up. John Wall would be great as well. So would Klay Thompson. Westbrook would be excellent‚Ä¶..except he has a super inconsistent outside shot and you have to be able to shoot in 3x3.   If America sends guys like 50 year olds like Stephen Jackson, Cuttino Mobley and Iso Joe, they‚Äôre not going to last, especially playing two games a day. They will absolutely tear something or get a heart attack"
I mean 2018 Kawhi Leonard didn't show up much on offense
"Even worse tho, if they had the 8th pick they could have gotten either Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, or Kawhi Leonard."
"According to this Woj article, Ingram was on the table:  &gt; The Lakers are willing to include former No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and a future first-round pick in a package for Leonard   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks"
Yes they did. But keep in mind doing a trade with the lakers almost certainly would've involved us taking on Deng's terrible contract.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks

As nice as that would‚Äôve been Ingram was never on the table https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/7/19/17585464/kawhi-leonard-trade-spurs-raptors-celtics-76ers-lakers
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks  Yeah it's better but the lakers were offering garbage for a top 5 player just like every other front office that offseason. Kawhi killed his value to an insane extent.
What a weird turn of events this would be.   Spurs not wanting to trade Leonard to the Lakers leads to  Kawhi and the Lakers still getting a chip while Demar would now want to be traded to be in this last Lakers spot.
2018 Kawhi Leonard without the offense part\*
Ben ‚Äú2018 Kawhi Leonard‚Äù Simmons
"Clippers also had a guy named kawhi leonard. Seriously. Look up the numbers when kawhi was guarding him and what luka was able to do then. Not much. Or even go back and watch the possessions against him. Luka was shook more often than not. Its no wonder, they would always look for the switch if kawhi was on him. When it didnt work, neither did lukas stellar offense. But yeah he torched the rest of the clippers. I dont disagree there."
"How you didnt include Kawhi in this. Even though Kawhi has shown he can give you just as much of an offensive threat as the guys you mentioned, while also being the only player of that list, to be able to shut the other 5 down defensively‚Ä¶ is beyond me. Hell. Even just last playoffs. Kawhi was scorching mavs, luka was scorching clippers. And guess what was probably the biggest reason the clippers ultimately edged out the mavs? Uhh, kawhi leonard was able to mitigate the damage luka did, cus he took on the defensive assignment of covering luka. And when kawhi was on him, luka wasnt doing much of anything. Talk to me when the other top 5 you mentioned can have an impact like that on both ends."
The Spurs went from Tim Duncan to Kawhi Leonard. Wait a minute....
"Facts. Its so dumb people say ""he hasnt gone far in the playoffs yet"" but his playoff numbers are already at an all time great level and has looked like the best player on the court in 2 series which have had Kawhi Leonard and Paul George."
Easy enough. All you need is Kawhi fucking Leonard haha
"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can‚Äôt just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team. I think it‚Äôs a good mix of scoring, passing, size, defense and experience.  Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
"Idk about you but if your team loses your best player and a top 5 player who was playing out of his mind to beat the Mavs and he's not playing the last 2 games. It's your job as a first seed and contender to take care of business.   We didn't give Giannis and the Bucks excuses with ""a bad matchup"" when the Heat bitchslapped them in the bubble and getting embarrassed in 5 games  If you want to walk and talk like a contender with a super deep team, DPOY, a superstar, and a contender for COY, act like it and capitalize on the opportunity to advance to the WCF and they got embarrassed. Not having Conley healthy and a bad matchup is not an excuse when the opponent was missing Kawhi freaking Leonard"

"I think it's hard to make the case that injuries hold Kawhi Leonard out of the top tier (and honestly Joel Embiid as well) but keep LeBron in there. He is going to be 37 coming off an injury that 100% looked like it hampered him. And the media narrative that he was playing as well as anyone before he got hurt is BS. If his name were anything other than LeBron James he would not be in tier 1. And I hate that we have gotten to that point with him, but it is the truth."
The disrespect to two-time champion and two-time finals MVP Kawhi Leonard... especially the way he's dominated Harden who perennially underperforms when it counts
"&gt;	Kawhi Leonard didn‚Äôt drop of because people are being ‚Äúfickle‚Äù, he dropped off because he underperformed in the bubble then suffered another knee injury.  Kawhi Leonard had a couple of bad games in the bubble which came at a very inconvenient time for his team. But he also averaged 29/10/6 on 59% TS. In the 11 games preceding those two he was ridiculous and even looked like he might be the best player in the playoffs after the first round."

"People need to stop using the term ‚Äúrecency bias‚Äù for when people use new information to inform and update their opinions. It‚Äôs not recency bias to consider what we just saw from players over the last 6 months, and reconsider rankings accordingly. Kawhi Leonard didn‚Äôt drop of because people are being ‚Äúfickle‚Äù, he dropped off because he underperformed in the bubble then suffered another knee injury."
"KD suffered the worst injury a basketball player could suffer, one that (to that point) only one player had ever successfully come back from, and the Nets gave him a max deal without hesitation, even knowing he wouldn't play for them the first year.  It's Kawhi Leonard, he could have signed a  year deal and he was still getting a max from anyone he wanted (as long as he showed that team he had genuine interest in actually going there)."
"What‚Äôs funny is when Carmelo was still a Knick a lot of fans ripped him and all of a sudden he‚Äôs been  romanticized since he was almost forced out of the league and signed with Portland. I‚Äôm a Knicks fan, I like Carmelo but don‚Äôt worship him like some Knicks fans do. Anyone who says Carmelo is better than Kawhi Leonard has no idea what they are talking about. Anthony has won three playoff series in his almost 20 year career and the last one was 2013. You don‚Äôt even need to bring out the numbers, anyone who watched both guys play at their peak can easily see its Leonard who is the far superior player. His play in the 2017 and 2019 seasons prove that and if he doesn‚Äôt get hurt by a dirty player in 2017 he could very well have led an upset to a super team (that he eventually beat a few years later). Kawhi has faced and beaten iconic and historic teams. Carmelo‚Äôs biggest playoff series win was against, at the time, the fraud Dallas Mavericks and the old men Celtics."
"Look, this is an unpopular opinion thread. I know this is unpopular, but I don‚Äôt appreciate you coming in here and trying to act like you have some higher level of understanding than me just because you like Davis. I can obviously tell that Davis is a very good basketball player, but I just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as good as most people seem to think he is. It‚Äôs not some hugely insightful thing to think AD is a great basketball player; most people think that.  That aside, Kawhi doesn‚Äôt take on the toughest assignments anymore for the most part, because he‚Äôs such a major offensive catalyst for the Clippers, but he was the only guy who could even phase Doncic in the playoffs. I think Leonard still has it, but just saves it for when there‚Äôs no other choice. David can do a lot of things, and I would agree that he‚Äôs probably the most versatile big man in basketball today. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs better than Jokic, who is better at every offensive facet of the game, or Giannis, who I think is better at everything other than shooting and blocking shots. I feel like Davis can‚Äôt be the true number one option on a championship team and in my opinion that puts you behind the guys that legitimately can."
"kind of hard to compare kawhi leonard playing only on contender teams with secondary stars and great spacing to melo playing with 39 yr old jason kidd, iman shumpert as his second option, raymond felton, and tyson chandler as his starters. his best scorer against rhe players in the 2013 ESF was 6th man JR smith averaging 13. for reference, kawhi's raptors had siakam averaging 20 ppg vs the sixers and lowry averaging 13, and they actually played on the same court as kawhi"
"Kawhi Leonard isn't a top player in the NBA.   He's injury prone, his defense has regressed since SAS, and the drama he creates (albeit usually silently on his end) is a distraction.   I think people overvalue the chip he brought to Toronto. They ignore that Toronto was a regular top seed in the East before him and won the 1st year LeBron left the east, benefitted from a Warriors team decimated by injuries, and we're a single 4 bounce shot away from not even making it out of the Eastern Conference Semis.   I'm not saying he's not good, he's a great player... But I don't think he's the super star everyone says he is."
The year Kawhi Leonard had Tim Duncan &amp; LaMarcus Aldridge on the same team.  Can someone tell me what **year** that was?
"I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre getting your information from, but they let Kawhi manage his injury pretty‚Äôs early on.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/11/23/16693304/kawhi-leonard-trade-rumors-history-timeline-spurs-gregg-popovich  Potentially as early as September of that season he was first reported as injured. (This is during preseason, the first game of the season hasn‚Äôt even happened yet)  If Kawhi‚Äôs group was managing it that early on, who is truly to blame for holding him out?   https://www.reuters.com/article/us-basketball-nba-sas-leonard/spurs-leonard-to-miss-preseason-with-thigh-injury-idUSKCN1C50SE  In this article they mention he was diagnosed with a right thigh tendinopathy, which is the exact injury his camp argued the Spurs missed.   February is where he goes off to NY to rehab where the Spurs ultimately lose contact with him. This is when we hear ‚ÄúKawhi is day to day, should return soon‚Äù  Spurs players and coaches ultimately get frustrated with the lack of info with results in Manu saying he has ruled out Kawhi, and Parker making the ‚Äúinfamous my injury was 100x worse‚Äù comment which was taken out of context.   The very next day the Spurs have a players only meeting where they talk with Kawhi (no one was in contact with him, and they were about to start the playoffs so they have the right to know what their teammates status was.)  Kawhi doesn‚Äôt show to any playoff games. Then off season where he is demanding to be traded.  Pop and Co. try everything to avoid this, even go as far as going up to NY to talk with Kawhi after Kawhi‚Äôs group says okay to meeting up.   Duncan and Pop both fly to NY but Kawhi ultimately backs out and doesn‚Äôt even meet with them. Didn‚Äôt even give them a chance, just tells them he wants to be traded.   I fail to see where the Spurs mismanaged his injury or Danny green was told to keep his mouth shut.   Kawhi wanted LA, which is fine. But dragging the Spurs through the mud was such a shitty thing to do, especially with the Spurs history with managing injuries and load management."
‚Ä¶ and you have yet to make it past the second round. The Raptors lost Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green in one offseason and then made it as far as the Embiid Sixers ever had in the postseason LMAOOO. Stay mad and stay watching second round exits until Embiid gets old or leaves.
He is the next Kawhi Leonard. Wdym
BREAKING NEWS TOMORROW   Kawhi Leonard joins PSG
Kawhi ‚Äúliteral turtle‚Äù Leonard
Kawhi leonard is not as good as people say he is
"Kawhi Leonard¬†[signed](https://twitter.com/LAClippers/status/1425938687146139650)¬†a reported four-year, $176.3 million deal with the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, according to¬†[Chris Haynes](https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-kawhi-leonard-signs-4-year-deal-with-option-to-stay-with-clippers-214419102.html)¬†of Yahoo Sports and¬†[Shams Charania](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1425938002279235586)¬†of The Athletic and Stadium.¬†  The pact includes a player option for the final year.¬†  Leonard was one of the biggest potential free"
"First of all, sick burn.   Second of all, I was referring to their playmaking ability. I guess I should've said ""Better playmaker than Kawhi fuckin Leonard"". It doesn't change the point at all. Kawhi's about average in that regard, and it's by far the weakest point of Tatum's game. He's significantly below average in that regard.   But hey, you dropped a sick ""high school english"" burn. I guess you won this one."
Yeah like Kawhi Leonard is holding on to pennies
Those announcers loved Patrick Willams more than his own parents. Had me thinking he was the next Kawhi Leonard.
"as a luka fan, kawhi leonard is such an impressive player. im glad he signed with the clippers. hopefully mickeytaps porzingis shows up this year and we can have a proper series"
BREAKING NEWS TOMORROW   Kawhi Leonard joins PSG
"Very interesting. I had this other unpopular opinion take on the trade, and that is I cannot fucking believe the raptors not only got Kawhi for derozan straight up in this trade, but that they ALSO landed Danny green in the deal and raptors only had to include jakob fuckin poetl.   Now of course there‚Äôs so many factors to consider, especially Kawhi‚Äôs value after he basically sat out all season and was on an expiring deal AND likely to leave after one season unless he was specifically traded to LA but I still feel like I can‚Äôt believe the raptors got him for so cheap. Kawhi is this all time great talent and while yeah Demar is a hell of a player is straight up not even close in comparison to Kawhi, and then you also get the Spurs 3 &amp; D ace in Danny green? that is just not a fair trade for me and I understand that the Spurs probably got the best deal they could I just felt like Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green is a LOT to give up for Derozan &amp; poetl"
Jordan played against a bunch of unathletic white guys and would be a worse Kawhi Leonard in today‚Äôs game. Put Lebron in that era and he averages 50 ppg.
"He's like Wade, great peak, memorable playoffs, won rings, but clearly held back by injuries  Kawhi Leonard without injuries could be a top 4-5 SF of all time  And I stand by the fact that Wade without injuries from 2005-2014 is the #2 SG of all time over Kobe"
"Dude, I fucking hate Kawhi as a person, but I can't believe this is a hot take. Tatum's good, but he's not Kawhi Leonard good.   Better than Kawhi fucking Leonard. Fuck outta here lol"
You don't think teams feared Tim Duncan or Kawhi Leonard?
"Paul George is overrated, said Dame took a bad shot when he shot that 3 in his face, said he wanted to stay in OKC, before Kawhi leonard came calling, laughed his ass off at Dame for missing free throws in the bubble, then choked hard against the nuggets. His cute little run this year had people forget about him.   KD gets hella hate for being a mercenary, so should George, even if he is nowhere near the player Durant is, not even close."
"You'll appreciate this distinction. I separate teams into the following two categories: would this team be a title contender if Kawhi Leonard joined the team or not? At the end of last season, the Bulls aren't a title contender even if he joined. Now? They still wouldn't be the favorite but they'd have a chance. Being one superstar away from contention is important, because as Toronto proved, you can get one superstar for your window if you play everything right."
AD has been better than which of these 5 players  Lebron James  Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  over the last 5 years.
"Absolutely. It‚Äôs a straight up hack of a sports entertainment channel. It‚Äôs reality TV, it‚Äôs everything peripherally entertaining except for the sport that they cover. In 2019 Kawhi Leonard won a chip and finals mvp, the first question Doris (ESPN) asked was ‚Äúso where are you playing next year?‚Äù. All they are really interested in is chasing off court narratives and drama. I think that is the worst thing to come of the NBA embracing the digital era. Just a consistently watered down product in favor of gossip and click bait driving the focus/attention of the network and forced onto the audience."
The raptors didn‚Äôt feel it cuz they had kawhi Leonard and now look at us just finished 12th in the east if derozan was on the team raps woulda made playoffs for sure
"Mom, I want Kawhi Leonard!  We have Kawhi Leonard at home.   Kawhi Leonard at home:"
"Kawhi Leonard, just turn him upside down and you will see the resemblance."
"He has bad fits when he doesn't get calls or if he plays poorly. No, we don't expect him to act like Kawhi Leonard or Khris Middleton, but we also don't expect him to act like DeMarcus Cousins on the court.  Yeah, fuck this sub for calling out bratty behavior"

"that clown deleted his comment cause he was scared for whatever reason but i am not, siakam is fucking ass lmfao, i can't believe y'all gave a 3rd option that contract, dude has no 1st/2nd option bone in his body unless kawhi leonard or any other superstar is playing alongside him to carry most the load"
Him making Lakers fans seethe and cry like they did was incredible. Kawhi Leonard doing the same was also amazing.
"I have this comment saved for this exact situation   Edit: please check out these numbers from as late as 2016 courtesy of u/Nejkulatoulinkatejsi:  Last year's (2016) postseason was the best defensive run by a wing ever.

Lol the Raptors lost Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green the season after winning the championship and that team had just as much postseason success as the Embiid Sixers have ever had. Worry less about the Raptors and more about making it out of the second round LOL.
"He is not okay, he is very good at them. Only 13 guys in the league shooting 3+ midrange shots a game had a better midrange shooting percentage than him last year. He had a better midrange shooting percentage than guys like Kawhi Leonard, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, Tatum, and others. And it's not like this is an anomaly, he shot basically the same percentages the season before.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*GE*3&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1"

"2019 is probably be the goat offseason. 2016-18 were all pretty crazy too but 2019 was nuts  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   Kemba Walker   ALL switched teams, and more then a few of them were pretty unpredictable"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Lillard said they didn't get the guys they wanted, that doesn't mean who we got isn't an upgrade over who we had. Simply not having to play Melo and Kanter at the same time is addition by subtraction, and Snell/Zeller are perfectly serviceable bench players.  People act like we were supposed to go out there and sign Kawhi Leonard with the MLE or some shit. We were never going to make a big signing and anyone who thought so is delusional. Our only chance at acquiring a top-tier player is trading CJ, but it looks like we aren't going to do that right now."
"Kawhi Leonard vs us in the 1st round...  Seriously though, 61.2% FG and 42.5% 3PT during the seven game series averaging 32.1 / 7.9 / 4.6 and nearly 2.5 steals a game  Not to mention Kawhi‚Äôs playoff defense"
Yes. Because of what that means afterwards. It means we have a young strong competent core that Kawhi Leonard will want to join next season.

When I was stationed in Ventura county I took my daughter to a Spurs/Clips game just so we could boo kawhi Leonard because I knew there weren‚Äôt no way we were winning that game.

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

"A team that despite being fucked over by injuries, suspensions and somewhat suspect ref‚Äôing in the finals, was 2 possessions away from repeating and capping off the greatest season ever. And then they added Kevin Durant. You would‚Äôve needed to add Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis to that Cavs team to balance out the rosters"
"Yeah we were calling him Meyers ""Kawhi"" Leonard"
"Aside from what others said regarding bonuses and incentives, there are a few other things.  Morals clause:  I was a sports reporter and the Denver Nuggets gave a try out to Dennis Rodman in 2003/2004.  He could have played with Carmelo Anthony during his rookie season.  But Rodman walked because the Nuggets wanted an out in case Rodman became a headache.    This isn‚Äôt going to appear in a max contract, but it is something that teams might consider.  For example, penalties if a player misses meetings or has conduct ‚Äúdetrimental to the team.‚Äù  Travel lodging:  Lots of players don‚Äôt live in their host city.  They can arrange for the team to take care of housing.  Alternatively, teams might be asked to cover their flights to wherever they need to go that isn‚Äôt part of the team travel itinerary.  This can include everything from charter flights to hotels to cars.  This can add up, especially if a player travels with an entourage.  Physical condition:  This is probably more of a thing in Miami, but they demand players to be in shape.  This can mean a player is expected to be able to perform certain tasks under a certain time.  For example, the Heat require players to do 10 baseline sprints in under a minute.  Players who don‚Äôt meet that requirement can be fined.  How you workout:  Depending on the player, teams might demand you not so certain things for exercise.  This might include riding motorcycles, skiing, or extreme sports.  If you get hurt doing stuff banned on the contract, teams can usually get money back or simply not pay you because it was your fault.  This happens more in the NFL.  What doctors you see:  You can always see other doctors, but this can cause issues.  Teams generally want their doctors saying when you can come back.  See Kawhi Leonard and everything that happened in San Antonio for reference.  Who has final say on a player‚Äôs return is a big deal.  Players generally want guys they trust to have the final say.    This has become an increasingly important issue over the years.  Teams have sometimes too friendly relationships with doctors and that might mean getting a surgery you don‚Äôt need, but will allow a faster return.    This can also lead to players delaying return to heal naturally, realizing they‚Äôre not healing properly, need a surgery, and missing parts of the season.  Illegal substances:  This one is self explanatory.  But in general teams don‚Äôt want you taking shit they didn‚Äôt authorize.  That said, Real Sports on HBO had an awesome story in July 2021 about how roughly 50% of the NBA was on the substance abuse list.  Over 200 players were on the list because of weed in the early 2000s.  Media events:  Players get paid what they do because of media contracts.    They are required to do promotional events.  Sometimes, this means showing up to a children‚Äôs hospital.  Sometimes, that‚Äôs doing media Q&amp;As.    I worked media relations at one point for an MLS team.  We had on player be a dick about signing a ball for a charity action.  We had to remind him it was in his contract and to just sign the ball."
This guy named Kawhi Leonard
"Lol. That was the best available. Spurs tried to replace Kawhi with someone ""similar"" position-wise. Also, why trade Kawhi to LA if they are within the same conference? Wouldn't you be literally handing the keys to your conference rivals?  Also, the Spurs still made the playoffs the year Kawhi left, pushing Denver to 7 games. So having to face Leonard at the West was a possibility then. No presentism pls."
"Steph Curry, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball and Ja Morant are probably must watch too. Charlotte is going to be fun as fuck to watch this year. Gonna try to watch them and the Nuggets in addition to the Warriors.  Jordan Poole is lowkey an amazing watch too. He's got a nasty handle, flashy passes, acrobatic finishes, and some footwork to get off difficult shots. He's in that Nick Young/JR Smith category where they aren't all-star caliber, but give you all-star highlights."
"What the hell are you talking about? Month and a half ago lmao.   KOC has been on Ben Simmons hand thingy since the initial draft analysis in 2016 and he did his own analysis. It started with this [article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2016/10/10/16077030/nba-shooting-coaches-kent-bazemore-kawhi-leonard-8660e9939680#.8fpqpp33l).    Here's the beginning:    &gt; It sure doesn‚Äôt look natural. For all the dazzling passes that made him an elite prospect, Simmons is a poor shooter; he hit just 13 of his 40 jump shots at LSU, and only five of 23 in the summer league. Those numbers come from me. I‚Äôve been tracking all of his shots going back to LSU, and will continue to once he returns to the floor in the NBA. Why? For one, because I am obsessed with weird stats like this, but there‚Äôs a deeper method to my madness: I believe Ben Simmons is shooting with the wrong hand, and I‚Äôve never been more sure of anything in my entire life."
mason plumlee for kawhi leonard
[Here is the requested fan fiction](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/17/report-kawhi-leonard-told-raptors-he-didnt-think-they-were-good-enough-to-repeat/).
"I was comparing Saddiq to his contemporaries not trying to criticize him.  I was thinking of players versatility like Kelly Oubre, Michael Porter Jr, Jason  Tatum. Jaylen Brown, Cameron Johnson,  Kawhi Leonard,  Paul George,  John Collins etc."
"What assets are they going to use to pull in Siakam? Once they give Kawhi his payday, they are going to be capped out between like 4 players (Leonard, George, Morris, Beverly) and they don't have any draft picks until like 2030.   Siakam is due $33M this year, and the Raptors could do a lot better than Morris, Bev, or Luke fucking Kennard."
"Dame scores more than Leonard and more efficiently over the last few years.  Kawhi is obviously the vastly better defender, but calling him the better scorer or playmaker is silly."
Maxi had a hurt achilles my guy. He‚Äôs one of our best defenders and took the task of guarding Kawhi Leonard
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
Picture a vibrant Kawhi Leonard without his personal politics
"Players are allowed to tamper, and talk to other players tho. Only teams aren't allowed to talk to other players. So Lebron can go out publicly and say he wants Kawhi Leonard on the Lakers, go and talk to Kawhi, and smooth talk him into joining the Lakers and face zero consequences. But, once a GM does the same, that's when teams get punished"
"If we had a time machine, we‚Äôd draft Kawhi Leonard in 2011 instead of Marcus Morris."
Lmao I remember the hype when Precious was drafted and there was a work out highlight of him and guys in our sub was saying ‚Äúthis is the next Kawhi Leonard!‚Äù
"I don't blame Kawhi but let's call it what it is: Kawhi is great if you have a system in place. It's why Toronto worked beautifully for him because Lowry was the spirit of that team.  Leonard has never led a team with his leadership. He's basically a for-hire assassin. That's fine but you can't play both sides, demand trades, and then not show up to be the leader. I mean, why was this dude in the suites eating popcorn while his team is in the playoffs gutting it out? At least stay on the bench to give them tips or moral support. Him separating himself from the roster and eating at the suite section just shows a lack of leadership. Bron and KD are divas but they don't cheat the game. They show up and work."
"Their size does tho, they are probably the strongest SGs of all time and used post moves and back downs often  Hell even Harden is strong as shit, Kawhi Leonard bounces off of him everytime he tries to back him down  I guess ""guard"" is the most diverse position as anyone with primary or secondary playmaking and high mobility can be a guard tbh"
Kawhi: ‚ÄúHey Steve‚Ä¶ the name on that contract I gave you says Leonard‚Ä¶ Myers Leonard!‚Äù
"Nah, plenty great players talked shit. MJ, Bird, Kobe, Dwade, KG. Stop it dog, let that man be a human. Everybody don‚Äôt have the personality of a wet rock like Kawhi Leonard.  I just wanna understand why shit all of a sudden different when it comes to Luka."
Now eh... not like Kawhi Leonard dipped after winning a championship or anything.
"Ah yes, notorious asshole Kawhi Leonard"
‚ÄúKyle Lowry ain‚Äôt no spot up fool he ain‚Äôt gonna tamper in the corner like some player option bitch this ain‚Äôt Bogdan Bogdonavic this a fucking god human Kawhi Leonard come again only this time he ain‚Äôt a bitch sign a new fucking contract and get traded at the same time!‚Äù
I think this is a disrespect to Mr. Big shot. Kyle lowry before Kawhi Leonard is known as a choker. His legacy is choke brothers. Then one run with kawhi leading the raptors change the narrative.
"This is an interesting point and the one I agree with. Ujiri traded for the man, knowing he didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere but in SoCal, and Leonard made the most of his interim time and brought Toronto a title.   The Raptors should absolutely call Kawhi near the end of his career and ask him if he‚Äôd like his jersey retired. Kawhi should be gracious enough to decline considering that fact, that he didn‚Äôt want to be in Toronto and bolted the second he could."
[Here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/clippers-vs-mavericks-kawhi-leonard-mercilessly-hunts-luka-doncic-to-close-out-latest-playoff-masterpiece/amp/) is a link demonstrating a three hunting him. Don‚Äôt take my word for it.  Watch his close outs next game. They are horrible. He‚Äôs just not quick enough to guard perimeter players competently.
"The 2017 Warriors were getting their asses handed to them by an injured Spurs team missing its starting PG. Kawhi Leonard, who's a poor man's MJ, was locking up KD. Go look it up. KD couldn't score for his life until Kawhi got taken out by Zaza.   You want to say it was just one game? Ok. You're seriously telling mean all time team like the Bulls would have problems replicating that defense intensity in a series? Seriously think about this. That Spurs team which was missing TP and had an old Pau starting games, was able to contain the Warriors. Nobody on that team is known as great defenders other than Danny Green and Kawhi. Yet they were still able to contain the Warriors and were up over 20 points led by Kawhi who was scoring on KD, Dray, Iggy, Klay, with no problem mostly in the mid range. MJ is 10 times the scorer Kawhi is. People saying who would stop KD as if Scottie and MJ couldn't hold KD. The real question is who's stopping MJ? Recency bias is a hell of a drug because MJ is on another level of scoring from KD. Even KD himself said MJ is a fucking god of basketball and study his moves to this day.   And what the hell is with people saying omg this team is going to be awestruck. HUH? Are we acting like this is some college team getting a chance to play the pros? This is the most legendary team of all time. It's Michael fucking Jordan. The bulls practice with the GOAT every single day. I'm sure they'll be ok watching Klay thompson average 19 ppg."
3 3-1 blown leads? Perennial underachiever? The Clippers achieved more when he left? Even without Kawhi Leonard?
"Some false parallels here.   Lonzo was playing as well last year as he is this year. And Jrue was already great.   Neither Middleton or Dinwiddie looked as good, and they were traded, as opposed to Ball, who they let walk.   Celtics trading Kawhi for Jaylen? I'm not sure that's a good trade. It's be a one-year rental and Leonard was a crap shoot in term of health. Hindsight says the Raptors won out, but that was a big gamble   The Cavs not trading a player is different than letting a player want. Granted, it was boneheaded, but Amare's health was a concern too."
"I think Rockets fans are the scum of the earth, lumped in with Lakers fans, Mavs fans, and Kawhi Leonard‚Ä¶.  I may not be unbiased though."
"If we're being strict about top 5 in MVP votes, there are some other good years.  01-02's top 5 in MVP votes --  Tim Duncan  Jason Kidd  Shaquille O'neal  Tracy McGrady  Kobe Bryant  &amp;nbsp;  06-07's top 5 in MVP votes --  Dirk Nowitzki  Steve Nash  Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  LeBron James  &amp;nbsp;  07-08's top 5 in MVP votes --  Kobe Bryant  Chris Paul  Kevin Garnett  LeBron James  Dwight Howard  &amp;nbsp;  08-09's top 5 in MVP votes --  LeBron James  Kobe Bryant  Dwyane Wade  Dwight Howard  Chris Paul  &amp;nbsp;  09-10's top 5 in MVP votes --  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Dwight Howard  Dwyane Wade  &amp;nbsp;  19-20's top 5 in MVP votes --  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  James Harden  Luka Doncic  Kawhi Leonard  &amp;nbsp;  Issue with a lot of the Magic / Jordan years is while there is an ideal starting 5 there of Magic, Jordan, Pippen / Bird, Malone, and any of the numerous dominant bigs from that era, they were never perfectly the top 5 in MVP votes."

"BAH GAWD, THAT'S KAWHI LEONARD MUSIC!"
Reminder that Kawhi Leonard is not playing
AND HIS NAME IS KAWHI LEONARD
Out of nowhere Kawhi Leonard walks through the tunnel for game 1
"Michael Jordan, Lebron, Kareem, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, Tim Duncan, Larry Bird, Kobe, Hakeem Olajuwon, Oscar Robertson, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Dwyane Wade, Moses Malone, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, John Stockton, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Steve Nash, Giannis, Tracy McGrady, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Erving, David Robinson, Isiah Thomas.  ...that's 30."
"My choices are: Kevin Durant, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard"
Paul George &amp; Kawhi Leonard tbh
"All-encompassing metrics for basketball are pretty garbage still, so I don't think that's the best way to approach it. My argument basically boils down to this: they had basically the same amount of team success, but Duncan had less help. They both have 5 rings. Kobe has one extra finals appearance, but also had 2 healthy seasons with losing records and 3 more with less than 50 wins. Duncan never won less than 50 games in a season.  Coaching-wise I think Pop vs. Phil is basically a wash. So it comes down to teammates. And as much as I love Tony and Manu and Kawhi and the Admiral, none of those guys were even on Pau Gasol's level, to say nothing of Shaq. (Robinson and Leonard both peaked when Duncan wasn't on the team).  I don't think it's a no-brainer by any means. But when I look at their careers side-by-side, it's hard to shake the sense that Duncan did more with less."
That‚Äôs still very cherry picked. The past five years doesn‚Äôt take into account the other season KD missed with a broken foot. It also ignores how curry had that ankle injury early on in his career which he fixed over time. The only valid point you made was kawhi leonard and he‚Äôs acknowledged as injury prone and literally has a degenerative condition. AD is still fragile no matter how much mental gymnastics you do
"It's not misleading at all, actually. If we take out the one major injury Steph, KD, Kawhi and AD had in the last five years, here's what their total missed games still looks like:  * **Kevin Durant:** 75 (he missed all 72 games with a torn Achilles in 2019-2020)  * **Steph Curry:** 65 (he missed 50 games with a broken hand in 2019-2020)  * **Kawhi Leonard:** 65 (he missed 73 games with his quad tendinopathy in 2017-2018)  * **Anthony Davis:** 49 (he missed 36 games last year with a calf injury)  You only believe this is misleading because you want to include every injury to AD but feel for some reason like including certain injuries for the other players shouldn't count. Why is that?"
"Here are some other top 10 players with their ages and how many games they've missed over the last 5 years before this one:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old  AD ain't nearly as fragile as you guys want him to be. The only time he's missed a significant amount of games with an injury in the last 6 years was last year following the shortest off-season in history, and he's still only 28 years old. I disagree with the idea that any team needs to wrap their star players in bubble wrap. Should we be worried that Steph Curry is averaging 34 mpg when he's about to turn 34? Or that Kevin Durant is averaging 35 mpg at age 33? I don't think so. And we similarly shouldn't be worried that AD is averaging 35 mpg at age 28."
"The only perimeter defenders in the history of the NBA/ABA to lead the league in defensive rating were both small forwards. Scottie Pippen and Kawhi Leonard, for exactly one season each."
"Nah, that is exactly what happened.  His personal doctors just disagreed with team doctors.  There is an arbitration process exactly for those situations.  [Here's a pretty good overview of what was happening with Kawhi](https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Sources-Leonard-still-not-cleared-by-his-12836007.php)  &gt;Leonard also continues to be monitored by two team officials while away in New York, and he's provided the Spurs with constant updates on his status since being sidelined once again since Jan. 15 before the Spurs played the Atlanta Hawks."
Kevin durant while being guarded by Kawhi Leonard in his defensive prime in 2016 WCSF put up 42 on 15/22 shooting. hes one of the most unguardable players in nba history

Well‚Ä¶. And kawhi Leonard remember he was helpful
FIFTEEN FOURTH QUARTER POINTS BY KAWHI LEONARD
"Lmao. Just look at the list bro. You can‚Äôt just look at the top 5 exclude everyone you don‚Äôt like and just go  ‚ÄúWell that looks alright‚Äù  The list a fucking mess of weird shit. Brandon Davis is ranked above KD who is somehow ranked 21. Jrue Holiday is ranked over Nash, Kidd, Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis.  You know who else is ranked over Davis? Nene. Fucking Nene is ranked above Anthony Davis.  And that‚Äôs just with a click glance at the top 30."
Kawhi leonard
Remind me of when Kawhi Leonard or Tyronn Lue publicly blamed PG specifically for the Clippers losing last year. I must have missed that.  Because that's what happened on the 76ers. Embiid and Doc dragged Simmons directly in public directly to reporters.
Same with Kawhi Leonard
Number of 50 point games  Corey Brewer: 1  Kawhi Leonard: 0  Just sayin'...
"We all have our biases, but there are some things that we can universally agree upon. Regardless of how much we like or dislike a player or a team, there are certain lines that should not be crossed.  Cheap shotting a player while he is defenseless mid air is never OK, and it's especially egregious when done to the star player. Jokic is a big man, what if he landed awkwardly and tweaked his knee or ankle? Kawhi Leonard, for example, has never been the same since Zaza blatantly went under him as he was landing. That not only changed the playoff series, but the entire trajectory of the Spurs as an organization.  Jokic was absolutely in the right to give Morris a receipt. This nonsense can not be allowed to be normalized."
Yeah just have kawhi Leonard sign in free agency and then PG want to go there! Easy!   Team building for LA or Miami has very little relevance to the rest of the league. They play by different rules.
fun guy:  Kawhi Leonard
"Idk, Luka was the best player in a series where Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were on the floor. Took healthy clips to 7 with no true second option on his team   At the same time Jokic was the best player on a WCF team and has an MVP  Can go either way tbh"
"LOOOL the only reason your team made it out of the first round were injuries. The Suns had one of the luckiest runs to the Finals in modern NBA history. Every single opponent they faced had either their best or second best player injured (or both lol).   LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and Jamal Murray all missed part or the entirety of their series against the Suns. Even with that luck, Phoenix *still* couldn‚Äôt win the championship."
The Kawhi Leonard special
Kawhi Leonard.
"Not playing this year, but Kawhi Leonard. His game is not only boring, but just ugly. The guy is not a good passer and never has been and I love watching great passing and ball movement. His top career highlight is the dumbest fucking play ever and a pure prayer of a shot that he got lucky on. I don‚Äôt understand the love at all. Also he‚Äôs one of the biggest divas in the game."

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"Like Kawhi Leonard who did exactly the same thing, but with far less of a reason."
If Patrick Williams had Ayo's confidence and hustle he would literally be a Kawhi Leonard replica.
Kawhi Leonard always looked like a guy with an incredibly high ceiling to me when he was at SDS. Wasn‚Äôt surprised at all to see his development as a result of hard work and constantly adding to his game every year.
Kawhi Leonard
"Just to be clear, the Celtics held onto ""assets"" for years when they could have made title runs (or at least get to the Finals) with the right move(s,) but now are considering Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons?  If Boston does that, it may literally be the dumbest trade to ever happen. Yeah, there's Kobe for Vlade and Kawhi for Georgie Hill, but those were at least draft-night trades. And let's not act like Kobe and Kawhi were guaranteed stars like LeBron and Duncan. Both Bryant and Leonard didn't get drafted until the teens."
"This definitely is a myth cause dude does not look like he's  6'10  https://www.clipsnation.com/platform/amp/2020/7/5/21313957/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-los-angeles-clippers  In this article, you can see pg's height versus kawhis and they are not that different."
Kawhi Leonard purchased a majority stake in the Mavs from Cuban
Anytime someone over 6‚Äô5 gets a steal he‚Äôs a Kawhi Leonard comp lol
You know that is cherry picked as hell. That 2014 Spurs team was not led by a Top 5 in the NBA Kawhi Leonard lol
"Tl;dr it doesn‚Äôt mean anything they just wanted a name for their advanced stat aggregator and the Raps just won the championship:  At FiveThirtyEight, we‚Äôve been running NBA predictions since 2015. We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our ‚ÄúCARM-Elo‚Äù season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).  But that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs new NBA statistic. We‚Äôre pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:  First, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn‚Äôt available in traditional box scores.  Second, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.  NBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things ‚Äî not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Jokiƒá and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.  /u/velvithippo"

Kawhi Leonard
bruh did they really throw in the Kawhi Leonard laugh during this emotional montage??? lmaooooo
and it should be called The Kawhi Leonard Rule!
Trying to pull Kawhi Leonard!!!
"He's not just talented offensively ""for his size"" lol. This very year, he arguably outplayed Kawhi Leonard over a 7 game series with a much inferior supporting cast. He already has as many all NBA first team selections in 3 years as Westbrook has throughout his career, and more first team selections than Damian Lillard. He is so obviously a generational talent."
"Yes I agree that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt have the benefit of the doubt.   I disagree with you about mental health support being about ‚Äúopen and clear communication‚Äù, it‚Äôs only has to be open and clear with your therapist. As long as that therapist doesn‚Äôt believe that your a risk of harming yourself or others that information should be privileged. I know that when you see a team doctor your HIPAA rights are waived as part of your employment record but I don‚Äôt think the same standard applies to mental health conditions. If it is proven that Ben Simmons is lying about his mental health in a cynical attempt to abuse the CBA than I agree with you he should be lambasted but until then I‚Äôm willing to hold out until it‚Äôs definitively proven one way or the other to lay blame.   I thought Kawhi Leonard was lying about his injury to avoid playing for the Spurs again but years after that incident I don‚Äôt know one way or the other. I know that the team cleared him and his personal doctor didn‚Äôt, anything past that remains speculation and assumption."
they prob still do yes because if they didnt do that. they wouldnt have gotten kawhi leonard

"Never saw him coach with Kawhi Leonard.   I did see him every year with DeMar as his lead option. Not to mention Casey‚Äôs final year in Toronto they were running Nurses offence. Like in the 76ers series it wasn‚Äôt coaching that won the game, it was the fact the Raptors could ISO kawhi with him playing the best basketball of his entire career.   No one could hit 3‚Äôs and Embiid destroyed everyone in the paint."
"And the reason Bud has his job is because KDs foot was on the line.   And they still easily could win with another coach. Even if they kept Casey good chance they could win, especially considering someone like Kawhi Leonard completely dismissed a talking point of Nurse when Nurse was talking about playing for a championship in the G-League.   Like in the 76ers for example, there was great defensive coaching but there was close to no offensive system working, it was largely a result of Kawhi just being the best player on the court.   Without Kawhi the Raptors don‚Äôt get passed round 2 in 2019. Tons of other people were replaceable in that series, including Nurse. And you don‚Äôt know anything about my opinions in coaching, so saying you don‚Äôt trust my take on that is a weird take."
The good players is the much more important part though.   Like the 2019 Raptors could probably still win with another coach. They couldn‚Äôt win without Kawhi Leonard
"Game 7 2016 NBA finals. Perhaps the closest finals series ever? Comes down to the last few possessions with nothing separating each team.   Game 4, 2017 NBA playoffs Memphis vs Spurs. Not a particularly important game, but very fun. Peak Kawhi Leonard is playing like a basketball robot, versus the last hurrah of the Grit and Grind Grizzlies. Both teams were old at the end of long playoff runs, spurs 19 years, Grizzlies 7 years."
"We did pass him the ball. He was one of 3 players that could dribble the ball for more than 2 seconds without losing it and all time great shooter and we still traded him.  No idea why we let Morey or whoever was in charge at the Sixers to fleece us like that. There have been so many bad trades and horrible decisions in the last couple of years but the Seth Curry one is special. That shit stings as an all time league history horrible trade.  And this isnt even talking in hindsight. Man was SUPER good for us too. I didnt even know who jrich was before we traded but i was expecting some strong ass dude with insane defense, u know some Kawhi leonard body type with how the trade was set up but nope this little cat with a super awkward shot comes in and was supposed to transcend our defense??? Get the fuck out of here  fuck donnie nelson and whoever yessed this deal"
"Ok so who does dame have on his team that compares to Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, manu, Kyle Lowry, pascal, Middleton, Jrue, Jason kidd, Tyson chandler, the list goes on and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
"Esp American dad, theirs heavy references of NBA in it.. the last one I saw was of Kawhi Leonard"
"If Lillard requested a trade last summer (before the Westbrook trade), and said the Lakers were his destination of choice, do you think they get him?  On one hand they don‚Äôt ha e the best package, but in the other hand this isn‚Äôt some Kawhi Leonard type trade where they don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs happy with the destination c"
"They had opportunities to trade for Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul and James Harden, so take your pick."
"The last time I did fantasy was 2017-18. With my first 3 picks, and I am not making this up, I picked Kawhi Leonard, Gordon Hayward, and Jeremy Lin.  I will never do fantasy again."
you know who else needed time to work into a new shot? Kawhi Leonard
"Deep playoff runs? Kawhi Leonard led that team. The Raptors got obliterated by Lebron by himself in 2018. Kyrie hasnt led a team to shit, and Lowry is definitely a winner, but I wouldnt give him the lions share of the credit other than the ecf appearance with Derozan."
"the fuck the hawks know about team building? bro yall haven't won shit..ever  lol. yall celebrated getttin to the ecf so far like yall are the yankees.   lmao dawg. i didn't say it's forever. they were not even a playoff team Dirks first few seasons, even with Finley bein an all star. it takes time to build. yall did this same shit with giannis   so many casuals ü§£ we also clearly tried to build with the KP trade which you bums act like it wasn't celebrated then. &amp; signed or traded for guys who have contributed piece by piece since Luka got here, &amp; developed like Brunson. &amp; actin like the clippers with Paul George &amp; kawhi Leonard is some easy thing to get past is also a casual harken. ü§£  casual casual, smh"
"Funny, I seem to remember Kawhi Leonard playing 4/6 games and Reggie Jackson averaging 18 on well over 50-40-90 splits ü§î"
"I said this elsewhere in this thread, but Boston had legit chances to trade for all of the following players: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Chris Paul. I feel like any one of those guys would have been huge difference makers. And I know Boston fans always say that would have compromised the future by giving up on Jaylen Brown, but honestly does the future look that bright as it is? I feel like the Celtics could have made actual legit runs at a championship, but you guys didn't because you didn't want to part with one or both of ""the Jays"". It was the wrong move, IMO."
Lance Stephenson   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  David West   Roy Hibbert
"OG reminds me so much of Leonard before he became a star it's crazy, he's the only guy that's deserved the ""Kawhi lite"" title"
"Yeah like Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, the emergence of Siakam, the coaching upgrade, etc had nothing to do with it. Ohh‚Ä¶ and lest we forget the departure of Lebron from the conference.  Like come on man‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre making it sound like all they did was cut DeMar, and they rolled the same team with everything else staying the same‚Ä¶ and booom!  a championship"
"Boston had legit chances to trade for all of the following players: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Chris Paul. Amazingly they passed on *all* of them!"
"Spurs fans were never going to appreciate him since he was what they got back for Kawhi Leonard. So they jumped all over the (admittedly bad) defense and this notion that he was a drain because, like, you couldn't sit him on the perimeter and expect him to drain 3s or something. I don't know that in the end they would have gotten much more than Thad Jones for him anyway but man, he went from being a shoot-first, ask-questions-later scorer to... late career Kobe, basically, with all the court vision, the midrange shooting, and the ability to take over games."
A step closer to a Raptors-made Kawhi Leonard.

"The Kawhi Leonard game winner is not ""The Shot"" and it never will be! There already is a ""The Shot"" and this aint it. ""The Shot"" even has its own [Wikipedia Page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shot) and it ain't about Kawhi Leonard"
Yeah and his name would be Kawhi Leonard
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."
you cant carry the offense on a luka/harden level and be good defensively. at least for anybody on the planet other than kawhi leonard
Dude casually tries to equate losing ben Simmons to losing kawhi Leonard
"But It would be impossible for that player to arise in today‚Äôs NBA due to the rule changes. They don‚Äôt allow you to play the same level of defense as guys in the past like Gary Payton, Scottie Pippen or Sidney Moncrief. In order for a player to be that valuable defensively, he would have to be other worldly athletic. Like Michael Jordan mixed with Allen Iverson and Dwight Howard. And even then, once coaches have gotten hold of the most athletic player of all time, they will coach him up into a majority offensive player. See what happened with Kawhi Leonard."
Cut us some slack we have regular season reggie and kawhi leonard out

You got a Steph curry performance out of a player nowhere near that caliber and have the audacity to say you‚Äôre missing your stars lmao. Talk about delusional   You were missing mike Conley, the third best player on your team. The clippers were missing kawhi Leonard, the best player in the series."

And this is not to be taken lightly. A more efficient kawhi Leonard is basically a basketball god in this era. Kawhi is already efficient dropping 30+. MJ would break the game.
Imma cheat a bit and use players out of position  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: Zach Lavine  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Ben Simmons  No one is beating this
George Mikan would dominate Anthony Davis and Bob Pettit would have Kawhi Leonard on skates!
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"&gt;Even with Shaq  Wdym ""even with"", Shaq drawing double and triples eating up Kobes bricks made it easy to score.  There's not many players in NBA history that have had such a luxury.  Not to mention he had PJax, a multi-NBA champion known for coaching circles around Popovich.  2004 Kobe tried to take over in the Finals &amp; *lost* his super team Lakers an easy championship.  Again there's not many players in history to sabotage a favorites chances at winning a ring.   &gt;And Duncan did play with Robinson, Ginobili, Parker, and Leonard  Robinson was on the verge of retirement &amp; TD had him for like 4-5 years max.  Manu was the only player he somewhat shared his prime with but he was no superstar and TP didn't hit his prime until like 2010, while Kawhi wasn't even in his prime until he retired.  SA could not acquire star free agents or trades, they scraped the bottom of the barrel for players teams didn't want.    &gt;LA Gasol  Lmao he was gifted Pau who was a top 5 big man at that time.  Odom AND Gasol were both leading their teams to the playoffs as 1st/2nd options.  These teams were LOADED to fuck, even Artest was like one of Houstons best playoff players before he went there.    &gt;And how is Kobe a chucker? He averaged more points than Duncan on the same efficiency even with more defensive coverage.  Someone didn't watch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, check the playoff stats Kobes play declined dramatically.  He was known to stay on the court against 3rd stringers &amp; chase Jordan's scoring records, TD gave 0 fucks and sat or allowed his teammates like TP to get a FMVP.  Guarantee you Kobe would never do such a thing..  Perimeter players weren't even good in Kobes era, all the talent was focused on bigs, countering Shaq, he literally influenced the way the league drafted.    Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, Dirk, KG, bruh Kobes top competition on the perimeter was like T-Mac and AI on those shitty 76ers."
"I find it hilarious when fans on the sub claim that players better be loyal because they need the fans to get money and respect. Like I understand it when it comes to scrubs and cult favorites, but do these pansies really think LeBron James, Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard is gonna have a shortage of fame and fortune lol.   Nets fans were among the ""Screw KD"" crowd for 3 years, did a complete 180 when he joined them. Plenty of Lakers fans disliked LeBron because of comparisons with Kobe before he joined us, didn't take a single second to sing his praises when he landed here. Superstars don't care where the cheers and the checks come from, as long as they keep on coming."
"Umm... The Spurs probably are not concerned about fit, this is just too big of a bargain to pass up. The Spurs have a history of bargain shopping...  **Revisiting the Infamous Draft Day Trade of Kawhi Leonard**   The Indiana Pacers traded Kawhi Leonard on draft night in 2011. The Indiana Pacers had the 15th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft on June 23, 2011. That pick will always be remembered as the time the Pacers traded for George Hill from the San Antonio Spurs for the 15th overall pick, which was Kawhi Leonard."
"In an alternative future, Kawhi Leonard is a california sports legend."
"Man, Mitchell really thinks Mike Conley makes a bigger difference than Kawhi Leonard."
Lol no kawhi Leonard
"I think the analysis in the Simmons-Embiid situation is off. Every team that takes a player with shooting issues is hoping that the shooting improves. Maybe you get a Kawhi Leonard Chip England miracle. Maybe you get some real steps forward like De'Aaron Fox. Maybe you get a real problem like Simmons.  There is an easy viewpoint where Fultz is healthy and Simmons switches to his right hand, and Simmons, Fultz, and Embiid all shoot threes at a nice clip.  If you want to take shots at the Sixer, aim them at their player development and medical teams ... maybe the community environment that seems to produce high pressure shooting collapses.  For the OP's point ... we might get a better answer to this question with my Kings' Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell backcourt."

"I raised the question to point out that black-and-white, accolade-based logic like ""FMVP &gt; no FMVP"" is silly and misguided. I'm not equating the careers of Derrick Rose and Kawhi Leonard, and I thought that was fairly obvious."
"Cory Joseph isn't a draft bust, and the Spurs ended up trading their PG of the future in George Hill for Kawhi Leonard. Keep in mind at this point in time the Spurs had been touting Hill as Parkers replacement, even [benching](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/384498-george-hill-revives-spurs-emerges-a-star-the-other-side-of-vinsanity) Parker in actual important playoff games."
I'm sure kawhi Leonard has enough self esteem to be able to laugh at himself too. Wouldn't lose sleep over it man
"Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nash, Dirk, Miller  Maybe less than mediocre is a stretch, but they were all pretty damn pedestrian as rookies and showed occasional flashes"
Why do people sleep on MJ by qualifying him with an era designation? The dude is basically Kawhi Leonard with much more athleticism.
"*Why would you tank when you have David Robinson, Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen and Kawhi Leonard as teammates and have Pop as coach"
Setting aside his speech about practice‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how anyone could say Iverson. The guy had an [unmatched will to win.] (https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/kawhi-leonard-explains-idolizing-allen-iverson)      His lack of playoff success had a lot more to do with a lack of good teammates than an incorrect mindset.
"Tony Snell. Closer than you‚Äôd think though too.   Snells Peak [1 Year]   71% TS   12-5-3 per50   Rookie Kobe   54% TS   7-2-1   Snell has that indescribable quality that makes a star. The per50 highlights his all-around game. The 71% TS speaks for itself; Snell has a bag. Hesi jimbos, dropsteps into contact dunks, floaters, snatchbacks, and of course his signature move.   Tony [I call him Tony as a close, deeply intimate, personal friend] is a natural leader, a fighter, a thespian. People forget he was the #1 option in HS over one Kawhi Leonard. I would never say he‚Äôs better than Kobe or even a Kawhi; but when you look at the stats, the real hooper stats, he was better than them all‚Ä¶"
By that logic - Kawhi Leonard.
[Yep.](https://www.nba.com/news/kawhi-leonard-has-surgery-to-repair-partially-torn-acl?amp=1)
"Lebron, Klay Thompson, Spurs Kawhi Leonard, AD, Hakeem.  Probably a better defense, and better offensive fit around a Heliocentric Lebron. Your team has more offensive creation but it‚Äôs kind of redundant. I‚Äôd still probably take your team but I made it close with less talent"
Paul George played great but the current clippers minus kawhi leonard just weren‚Äôt a finals team.
"To be fair, I never really considered them favorites myself. A very good team with PG and Leonard but the ""scrappy clips"" reputation was largely garnered by getting a couple wins against the Warriors where the starters were clearly lackadaisical and there was a drastic drop in quality to the bench. I never expected that Lou Will or Pat Bev would improve much with Kawhi or Paul George around."
Sometimes the dark ages have to blanket the nba universe in order to birth a new story arc. Enter Kawhi Leonard as the False King. He was believed to be the new main character that would be one of many catalysts to destroy the KD Warriors.
"While we're on the topic of those dastardly Cloppers... it's kind of insane that Paul George's 36 was their best in any of last season's 72 games, arguably not much for as good a season as they had.  So how many times did a member of this team top PG's regular season record in the playoffs, given only 19 playoff games?  * Kawhi Leonard 45 * Kawhi Leonard 41 * Paul George 41 * Paul George 37 * Terance Mann 39"
Lol. Sure you could say that. But I could also say THT has mini Kawhi potential. Kawhi Leonard averaged 12ppg in 30mpg as a 22 year old‚Ä¶
I'm just a sad Pistons fan. I for sure thought he was the next kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard is not the most improved shooter in NBA history.
"Magic Johnson got nicknamed ""Tragic"" after a bad playoff run in the early 80's.  Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  The Brooklyn Nets called the Brooklyn Nuts after we got Kyrie.  Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  Zion Williamson ""Snorlax.""  Kawhi Leonard was ""Wi-Fi"" because he was amazing but he would cut out on you whenever he felt like it.  Someone called Lamelo Ball ""LMAO Ball"" when he looked like he might bust but Lamelo escaped that fate.  The Lakers were the Los Angeles Flakers after the 2004 loss.  Andrew Wiggins was ""Adrian"" because despite being 6'8"" with a 44"" vertical his most famous Youtube clip was a prankster asking him if he was Asian and he thought the guy said Adrian."

Imma say bird on the 2014 spurs. He fits the switchy defence / ball movement / shooting like a glove and gives us that dominant scorer and shot creator we were lacking.  Tony Parker Manu ginobili Kawhi Leonard Larry bird Tim Duncan
"MVP: Dwyane Wade, Jerry West, or Kawhi Leonard   DPOY: Tim Duncan   SMOTY: Andre Iguodala  FMVP: Steph Curry"
No but I remember that time Kawhi Leonard chocked away the series  shooting *1-11* in the second half game 7.
"Nothing realistic if they could have gotten Anthony Davis or Kawhi Leonard something crazy like that for a couple seasons he possibly would have signed a short-term extension but the way things were, nah he was out of there"
[Is this the pic?](https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDA3MjExMjEzNDY0ODQ5/kawhi-leonard-dunk-giannis-antetokounmpo-louvrejpg.jpg)
"I think there are real questions here as to what the league can actually do. They don't have authority to just do whatever they want. ""The league"" is really just the owners collectively, and anything they want to do needs to be agreed to by the players. I guess it's possible they could try to sue Simmons for breach of contract, but I think there's already language in the CBA for dealing with a player who won't report when they're under contract.   I remember that being discussed after Kawhi was traded to Toronto and [there were rumors that he wouldn't report there either,](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/report-kawhi-leonard-wont-hold-playing-toronto/) with people saying if he didn't report he wouldn't get paid, but the Raptors would retain his rights until he fulfilled the year long obligation they owed him. So it wasn't like he could just sit out the year and then become a free agent, that wasn't a possibility.   Simmons could say that if they don't trade him then he'll retire, in which case he won't get paid and Philly will still retain his rights, but of course the Sixers would lose him as an asset and player, so it would be a situation where everyone loses. Or Simmons could show up and sandbag it like Vince Carter and James Harden and try to force a trade that way. Really this whole thing is just a game of chicken, seeing who will blink first."
"Not sure about other teams, but 2016 was pretty big for the Raptors.  - 9th overall: Jakob Poeltl (traded for Kawhi Leonard)  - 27th overall: Pascal Siakam  - Undrafted: Fred VanVleet"
"It would be a big slap in the face if he did not play though.  Seriously that entire season was catered to him, rest management was real in effect, no back-to-backs, 25% of the games he could rest.   It's an understatement how difficult that is as a whole. It was mentioned in the season but no one really had an idea what it meant. Players all came to defend him on the media like CJ Miles saying like we're gearing towards the playoffs. Most roster changes in the entire season, new players prior to the season and another overhaul midseason for Gasol all backing up Kawhi's plan.  Media and fans alike where like why isn't Kawhi playing? I pay my hard-earned money to see these stars this is not fair. We could have piled a few losses and our first time head coach could have said ""We needed our superstar player"" but we stuck to the plan and it paid.  It's a fickle thing, I'm hoping they elaborate on this championship a few years down the road. During the Rachel Nichols interview both Lowry and Leonard laughed about the hardship and couldn't reveal any further details.   Also Kawhi would have been paid regardless, 27/7 for the season and he already made his stamp during the 76ers series."
Knee tendinitis  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2838743-woj-kawhi-leonard-dealt-with-tendinitis-injury-in-eastern-conference-finals.amp.html
"Honestly man, you're touching on it... It's all confidence and a certain mentality that separates most good from great players. Or non nba vs nba players. When I played at my highest level, I played a role on a team of really good players, vsed state players often (in my state in Australia). I was decent, but If I miss 3 shots in a row, I don't have the arrogance to just keep shooting. My logic kicked in and I'd become passive and pass up shots.   It really makes me resonate with ""confidence players"" like Kevin Love and Ben Simmons... When they're feeling it, they can be a top player. But when you get pushed to 4th or 5th option, they go from a top 20 player to a top 150. Kevin Love has talked about this and how his confidence would come in waves, like most overly logical people. But then you watch dion waiters, draymond, Morris brothers (to name some of the average offensive players) .... These guys have this never ending supply of confidence lmao.  That never ending supply of confidence is so common in the NBA. You see kawhi Leonard just yamming it on Klebers head and in slowmo his face (kawhis) didn't look the slightest bit fazed going up against a 6'10"" guy contesting him lol. A lot of quiet players like harden, derozan, kawhi still have that supreme confidence even if they come across shy/withdrawn."
"I can understand that, but how does that square with the rumors that he wants to play for ""one of the three"" California teams""? Did he think the 76ers were going to get kawhi Leonard for him or something? (He might be that deluded, lol)"
"Kawhi Leonard with average health; he'd probably have 2 more rings, at least, and possibly one or more regular season mvp"
"Two time nba champion, Kawhi Leonard?"
"What are you talking about my dude? PG was traded. Kawhi demanded Clippers to trade for PG for him to consider signing there.  ""When the Clippers' brass first met with Leonard at Rivers' home in Malibu, California, Rivers recalls that he had interest in playing for the franchise but not as it was constructed at that time: ""He said, 'I want to play for you' and he pointed at me. He said, 'Mr. Ballmer, I love the things you do and what you stand for, but your team is not good enough and if you don't change your team, I'm not coming.'  ""That led to the Clippers presenting Leonard with a list of potential trade targets, but Rivers said there was only one player he wanted to join forces with: ""We just showed him guys that we thought would match him and when he saw Paul George's name he said, 'I want to play with him.' We showed him everybody else and he didn't want to hear it. He just stayed on Paul George."""
"If he really thought he would get a trade that would be a win for him after Ben fucked up as bad as he did. The SAS ‚Äûonly‚Äú got DeRozan, Poeltl and a protected first for Danny Green, who is a career 40 fucking % shooter from 3 and Kawhi Leonard who is 10 times the player Ben is or ever will be. And I rather have 2 good rentals than a piece of shit car that could break literally any minute"
"It should be brought up that the report was that in the Clippers' recruitment pitch to Kawhi in 2019, Doc Rivers pushed the idea that they could pursue Paul George to get as Kawhi's teammate when Kawhi reportedly told them ""your team is not good enough and if you don‚Äôt change your team, I‚Äôm not coming.‚Äù  &gt; Rivers claims he knew Oklahoma City ‚Äúwanted to break their team up‚Äù and initiated a full-court press to obtain the star forward. ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/20/doc-rivers-talks-kawhi-leonard-paul-george-how-clippers-pulled-off-deal-decade/))  So Doc put forth a lot of effort to go get and coach the guy that had cheated on his daughter, which is very weird."
"Sure, but it depends on how much you push for position accuracy. A lot of the guys I could drop Jordan for are PGs or big wings, not really SGs (e.g. Dennis Johnson or Kawhi Leonard). Sidney Moncrief I think was an SG though?  Could also drop Rodman for Duncan, Garnett, or Olajuwon, or if you care less about positions, play Mutombo at C and slot Russell at PF - depends on how much you consider rebounding part of defense, really. Pippen absolutely *has* to be on the team though, I think."
"I love Duncan but I might go with Larry as SF and slot LeBron as the PF for the all-time team.  For all D, I think I'd actually swap Jordan out (yes, he was a very good defender, but falls just short of the greatest wing defenders in history). Only tough thing is most of the other good ones were either PGs or big wings, so he actually does have a reasonable argument for SG, even though I'd probably go with Dennis Johnson or Kawhi Leonard. Maybe Sidney Moncrief?"
I‚Äôd probably have Kawhi Leonard as MIP but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd disagree with anything else in the OP.
"A dynasty? Absolutely not, they were consistent but not dominant, you have to at least defend your Championship successfully at one point for me to even say that, especially when a true Dynasty (the Shaq and Kobe Lakers) happened right under your watch       And would I consider them a super team? Nope, just a team that had some luck and drafted really really well, is Tony Parker and Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard had all been number one picks for top three picks, something crazy like that you could at least make an argument to convince me, but the way they got those guys? Not a super team at all"
"Jesus christ it'll be Luka's 4th freaking season in the NBA.   Championship teams aren't built overnight and quality free agents aren't exactly lining up to join the Mavs.  Do people expect Luka to play with a championship ready team every year of his career? Jordan won in his 7th season, Lebron won in his 8th. Not every player gets to be Kobe Bryant or Kawhi Leonard."
"2013-era Blake, Dwight, Paul Pierce, KD, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, LMA, Zeebo, Melo, Wade, Bosh, and Brook Lopez are all putting up big numbers in the 1980s. To suggest otherwise is a joke. Others like Garnett, Joe Johnson, and Steve Nash deserve on that list if you look at their entire body of work."
The Nets should be in a tier of their own and the Clippers with Kawhi Leonard should be in the same tier as the Lakers
Kawhi Leonard is a great player but because of his age/injury record I think he should of never gotten more than a year/2year contract.
"Even if defense wasn't the most important in the league back then ( which it was), it indisputably was on that team, they were consistently a great offensive team prior to drafting bill, what set them over the top and made them THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DYNASTY IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA was bill russells leadership and incredible defense. Even today, what sets kawhi Leonard apart from someone like Devin Booker or Trae, who both averaged more points per game than him, it's the elite defense.  To call bill Russell, a 12x all star 5x MVP 11x champion 11x all NBAer 1 time all defense first team (the last and worst season of his career being the first year this award was even being given), and 4x rebounding champ just another Ben Wallace is completely insane. He probably would've had even more awards had the even existed while he played, I mean the dn fmvp is named after him."
"Kawhi Leonard got lucky on the Raptors and fell into a perfect situation, and he'll never win another championship as the best player on a team."
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"He is actually right around average in defense, check his drtg and dbpm. If you watch him play, he ain‚Äôt no Kawhi Leonard but he‚Äôs no Trae Young either. He has a quick first step, way above average height for his position so he can flexibly defend 1-3 and have the height advantage, and he has excellent mobility for his size. He does have issues with defensive effort, doesn‚Äôt put in 100% every possession and he doesn‚Äôt treat every person he defends with the same attention. He clearly doesn‚Äôt do any of that Jrue Holiday, Draymond Green shit where they study tape and specifically practice how to guard each all-star level player on the opposing team. His cardio isn‚Äôt elite enough to have that much offensive load while also putting max effort into defense.   But by all metrics I‚Äôve seen, he‚Äôs right about there, some show slightly below or slightly above, but he‚Äôs not a turnstile on defense. His average defense is actually why he‚Äôs just so much better than Trae, because while Trae is an offensive weapon, he‚Äôs a massive liability on defense. To the point where he‚Äôd be specifically targeted every other possession for the switch, and he‚Äôs just not athletic enough or tall enough for even many PGs, 2s and 3s will straight up ignore him and shoot over him. People used to criticize Steph for his lack of defense but he‚Äôs actually league average most seasons too, he just got targeted since he used to be the weakest defender out of the starting lineup. And people would see that and critique him for getting shitted on by LeBron or Kyrie."
"I wish there were more clear stats to show how effective someone's individual defense was. To compare Ron Artest to Bruce Bowen, Kawhi Leonard etc."
Ballmer‚Äôs logic:   Kawhi leonard snd Paul George are our teams best players.  Both kawhi and pg have had terrible leg injuries.   Therefore we need more players with a history of leg injuries
And more importantly kawhi Leonard lol
There was a post saying Kyle Kuzma was a decent defender against Kawhi Leonard because his reaction time was so slow to fall for any of his fakes
"Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Caris LeVert, Kawhi Leonard and Brook Lopez.  Edit: I didn‚Äôt read the post correct and they‚Äôre not in order"

"""I am a cybernetic organism, living tissue over a metal endoskeleton"" -Kawhi Leonard"
"This is reminiscent of Jordan Poole during rookie just kind of casually dribbling the ball in front of Kawhi, and then Kawhi just...took it. I sort of imagine the Dubs coaching staff looking at the film with him and just dumbfounded ""you do know that's Kawhi Leonard, right?"""
That brings the question of: is Kawhi Leonard actually a robot? Has anyone seen him bleed? Or shit? Or eat? Or sleep? When he sweats is it just exhaust from his parts cooling? Could he be an android?
Just you wait for Wiseman/Kuminga/Wiggins to become Kawhi Leonard

They changed his release point from over his head to in front of his face.   &gt; Tweaks and consistency are things you can pretty much count on if they guy has a work ethic.  You absolutely cannot count on improvement like Kawhi's, which is [unprecedented](https://grantland.com/features/the-shot-doctor/):  &gt; Sports-Reference.com‚Äôs college basketball site has full-career data for NCAA players going back through the 1999 season. Since that time, no player who took 150 3-pointers in college before taking the same number of 3s in the pros has improved their shooting percentage on triples more than Kawhi Leonard has"
"This is the way to understand them:  * Gobert is the floor-raiser. With Gobert, the Jazz have a top defense and can make the playoffs if he's healthy.  * Mitchell is the ceiling-raiser. With Mitchell, the Jazz have a guy who can elevate his game on the biggest stage. Mitchell's like 3^rd or 4^th in playoff PPG all-time.  I don't know if Mitchell alone can carry a team to the playoffs, but I do know that he can be the best guy in a series against Paul George and Kawhi Leonard (until he got hurt)."
I made a case a little while ago how Jonathan Kuminga would be a good basketball player but shows nothing of Kawhi Leonard and that the comparisons by GSW beat writers were lazy.   And I learned that day that the GSW sub has the most subscribers of any on Reddit.
"Chip Engelland [has said](https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/The-Kawhi-Leonard-companion-Chip-Engelland-6636495.php) that the change was more some tweaks than an overhaul, but that changing one's shot can still be difficult for some players to process through."
"Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice does. Imagine Kawhi learning under a coach like Byron Scott or Luke Walton. He would have put in the work and likely made all star on talent alone but could have wasted away on mediocre teams and never reached his full potential. 80% of Kawhi Leonard is still a star but that push by Pop and the Spurs development team pushed him toward the superstar level that we see today."
"&gt;His outside shot was never broken  Kawhi's jump shot in college was broken. He shot 25% on threes and wasn't much better from midrange. From a [pre-draft report](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Kawhi-Leonard-5821/):  &gt; What makes Leonard an enigmatic prospect is his lack of a go-to offensive skill, despite the many different ways he was involved in San Diego State's game plan. According to Synergy Sports Technology, no single offensive situation accounted for more than 17% of his touches, with Spot-Ups, Isolations, Put Backs, Fast Breaks, Cuts, and Pick and Roll situations each accounting for anywhere between 8-18% of his total possessions. Leonard ranks right around the 45th percentile amongst all NCAA players in each of those metrics in terms of Points Per-Possession.  &gt;  &gt; His lack of tremendous situational efficiency stems from the fact that there are a number of holes in his game that he'll need to work on, especially out on the perimeter. Leonard's most notable weakness is his lack of jump shooting ability. ***Connecting on just 32% of his catch and shoot jumpers and 28% of his pull-ups last season, the sophomore struggled with his consistency from range***. As with all players noted for their hand size, there are questions about Leonard's ability to develop a reliable jump shot. While there is some merit to that stereotype, if will be necessary for Leonard to continue honing that part of his game to the greatest extent possible."

"Absolutely. The fact of the matter is that we know 82 games plus the playoffs is a lot on an athlete‚Äôs body. And if you are a player who‚Äôs constantly in the playoffs, then that mileage is even worse. They are put into this position because of the scheduling.  So you either have to axe the schedule down significantly and spread games apart with more rest days, or, just accept that the high-performing, older, star athletes are going to need to rest. Our bodies are fragile and that‚Äôs what their entire life is dependent on.  The other question for the NBA is this, would you rather have a Kawhi Leonard load manage for the back half of their career but be very healthy and play at a high level for 12-15 years, or would you rather force these athletes to burn out and lose productivity in the playoffs after 10 years? Because I think the answer is obvious. You want those players to play as long as possible at as high of a level as they can."
"He probably should at least be Mikan retired by the Raptors. At the very least, he should have a banner that says 2019 Finals MVP- Kawhi Leonard"
"I had put money on Milwaukee, so I was upset about that. I felt like Kawhi Leonard reminded everyone who the fuck he was. I also felt bad for Steph Curry; he really deserves to win a FMVP before he retires and 2019 was a great chance for him before the Klay injury.  If anything, I was hopeful we might get a team back in Vancouver as a result."

"No argument here, and I even thought they were getting a little disrespected last year with both Mitchell and gobert being picked last in the All-Star Game, and nobody picking them as a contender despite their number one status, but once Kawhi Leonard went down and they still couldn't get the job done, I understood why lol"

"&gt;when a player tells you about his body and medical staff saying no to the point where he goes to another city to seek out another medical staff opinion  Except that didn‚Äôt happen. The Spurs LITERALLY tried to shut Kawhi down for the year after they diagnosed his chronic injury. You‚Äôre speaking on things you have 0 knowledge of.    &gt;that‚Äôs called listen to your player first.   They did listen to him, and the Spurs have listened to every other one of their players that have dealt with major injuries. Why would they suddenly just ignore what their current star player is telling them? Where is the logic in that? Kawhi wanted to go to LA and found a path way to doing so.   &gt;Spurs doin the PR run and saying they wanted to shut down Kawhi is horseshit  Yes, because the San Antonio Spurs and Gregg Popovich sure do give a fuck what the media and public opinion say about them right? So they wanted to shut down their star player for the sole reason to save face and make the press happy huh? That might be the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever heard, this whole conversation is just you talking out your ass.    &gt;they wanted him back in the playoffs and he ignored them  Yes they wanted him back for the playoffs like any team would, but not once did they force that man to go on the court when he said he wasn‚Äôt ready so I have no clue at what you‚Äôre trying to get at. And once again you have the your time table wrong, Leonard ghosted the organization before the post season."

Are you Kawhi Leonard?
"My man, there were five seasons between the Lakers making the playoffs and Lebron joining. They had a stretch of 3(!) seasons without an all time great, going from Kobe to Lebron and eventually AD and now Westbrook.  Some of the notable guys who have played for the Lakers include:  Shaq  Kobe   Magic  Kareem  Wilt  Lebron  AD  Westbrook   Jerry West  Elgin Baylor  George Mikan  James Worthy  Michael Cooper  Byron Scott  Vets like Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash,   Plus guys who reportedly wanted to play there like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Chris Paul, etc.  I really don't think it's a stretch to say that they've been a blessed franchise. They have 17 championships, tied for the most. They had a handful of bad years because Kobe was at the end of his career and they were doing right by him. Then they botched their rebuild to an extent, until Lebron fell in their lap and they were able to get Anthony Davis for a bunch of guys who mostly don't even play for the Pelicans anymore."
"People say this, but he actually didn't grow 2 whole inches. People for a long time were saying he grew to 6'10""-6'11"", and he never visibly looked that tall. A true 6'10""-6'11""  guy looks like Giannis or AD. They are massive looking on the court. PG was listed at 6'9"" for the longest time, but is now listed at 6'8"" officially by the Clippers, when they did the height without shoes listings.   For reference, in the 2010 draft, he was measured at 6'7.75"" without shoes, and he is likely still that exact same height, and got rounded up to 6'8"". He doesn't look much taller than 6'7"" listed Kawhi Leonard when pictured with him."
Tired: Kawhi Leonard     Wired: Kawaii Leonard
&gt;The Clippers -- **despite Kawhi Leonard missing much of the series** -- scored 127.7 points per 100 possessions while dismissing the Jazz in six games during the Western Conference semifinals.  Bit of an exaggeration considering he missed 2/6 games.
"The team record thing isn't that significant. The Raptors won 59 games with Derozan, but only 57 with Kawhi Leonard. Does that mean Derozan is better than Kawhi?  And then after Kawhi left, led by Siakam, the Raptors were still on a 50 win pace. Does that mean Siakam was playing at the same level as Kawhi? Or as good as a number one option.  Also what never gets mentioned is the Bulls record in 93. Which was -10 wins less than 1992. So it is a weird year to compare with the solo Scottie season.  From 1991 to 1998 the Bulls record was:  - 1991 - 61 wins - 1992 - 67 wins - 1993 - 57 wins - 1994 - 55 wins - 1995 - 47 wins - 1996 - 72 wins - 1997 - 69 wins - 1998 - 62 wins  That 55 and 47 season to me looks pretty clear the Bulls were significantly  worse with just Pippen no MJ. 1993 they were coasting."
"So you're saying you'd never ever trade for freaking Kawhi Leonard and Danny G for Demar ? You'd be fine with him sitting at the end of playoff games, more sweeps and getting cooked by Cleveland version of Clarkson?"
Can‚Äôt see it as ‚Äúsettling‚Äù for midrange shots. He has the best handle in the league so he‚Äôs capable of getting the shot he wants 9 times out of 10. He‚Äôs taking what he‚Äôs comfortable taking not settling. And if he just went 50/40/90 that can‚Äôt suggest he isn‚Äôt able to create enough separation consistently.  Also linking shot creation to handles is just not making sense. Kawhi Leonard handle is nothing special but he gets to his spots and does what he does. Saying their handles are better because they take better analytic shots has me very confused. At the end of the day though curry  is the better player.
I agree but do Raptor fans just like to pretend Kawhi wasn't the main reason you guys won? Lol yeah danny green had a ring but y'all had motherfucking Kawhi Leonard. A finals mvp dawg. Sure Lowry was the emotional leader but everyone on that team looked to Kawhi to lead them into battle. His fearlessness and pure talent paved the way for the Raptors to buy into the team. He instilled confidence in players like Lowry and Siakam to reach their full potential knowing Kawhi would be there to bail them out if need be. Some players need to lead through their words. Kawhi leads by example

"This may be the litmus test of just how far the Player Empowerment era will go. It's fine if you're a Lebron James, Antony Davis, Kawhi Leonard or a Kevin Durant, you know, franchise changing talents. Ben Simmons is good, but he's not even the best player on his team, and some might argue not even the second best."
"Not random! If the player's hometown was in the 50 United States or Canada, I got the latitude-longitude of the hometown and used the haversine formula. Using Harden as an example, his [hometown is Compton](https://theundefeated.com/features/rockets-james-harden-and-mom-sports-shaped-mvp-candidate/). In SoCal, the margins are very small. Harden's 12 km from the proposed Inglewood site and 16 km from Staples.  Kawhi's from [Moreno Valley](https://www.theringer.com/nba-preview/2019/10/3/20895966/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-los-angeles-clippers-stories-growing-up), which is 96 km from Staples, 102 km from Inglewood and 61 km from Anaheim.  I added teams because there were some good players languishing as like 7th or 8th string because their areas are just too packed. If we were only counting the original 30 NBA arenas + Seattle:  * Staples is the closest arena for 38 players * United Center in Chicago is closest for 63 * Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indiana is closest for 77!"
"Absolutely - his mid-range game is GOAT status. It adds to the sheer audacity of his accomplishments that he wasn't a volume 3 point shooter and he did most of his damage in the mid-range. Guys like Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard etc. are keeping this lost art alive."

"I interpreted that ""deep search"" as the fact that we traded George Hill, at the moment a fan favourite and considered with a solid future, for Kawhi Leonard so we indeed did a deep search to scout him enough and consider him someone to trade for. Maybe I'm wrong?! Did I misinterpreted?"
"Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.   Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!   Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)   And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.   Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.   Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.   So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"

"Maybe not, but he can lock up the opposing teams best guard in a way that Rondo even in his prime couldn't manage. Clippers didn't need another playmaker/ball handler like the Lakers did. We needed a stout defender who could hit 3's.   (all following quotes come from this Sports Illustrated article - https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/how-patrick-beverley-silenced-doubters)  &gt; Pat Bev answered the call. In the 45 possessions that Beverley guarded Mitchell in the playoffs, Spida scored just 10 points on 23% from the field, turned the ball over 4 times, and was blocked 5 times. In the 72 minutes that Mitchell and Beverley shared the court, the Clippers were a +29.  &gt; Coming into the WCF, Devin Booker was averaging nearly 30 PPG in the previous two rounds. His dominance helped Phoenix eliminate the defending champs in the opening round, and sweep the MVP in round two  &gt; After Booker put up a 40-point triple double in game one of the WCF, Ty Lue inserted Patrick Beverley into the starting lineup for the remainder of the series. While the Clippers were unable to overcome the loss of Kawhi Leonard, Ivica Zubac, and Serge Ibaka, Pat Bev had Booker locked up. In the 110 possessions that Pat Bev guarded Booker, D-Book shot just 28% from the field, turned the ball over 7 times, and did not make a single three-point basket.  So, again, currently they are pretty even they just have different skillsets"

"If we‚Äôre trying to be realistic about how a team would actually mesh and accept their roles, this is my team-  Center- Tim Duncan. Best teammate of all time, can move the ball well for a center, all time great defensive anchor.   Power Forward-Kawhi Leonard. Platonic ideal of a 3 and D 4. Super efficient, amazing defender, doesn‚Äôt need to be the man. Had a lot of success as a role player and knows how to be one.   SF- Larry Bird. He‚Äôs going to be my 1 go to scorer, great playmaker, shooter and solid defender. I took him over other options at this spot because McHale and Parrish were able to be their best selfes alongside bird. He didn‚Äôt make his teammates sacrifice for his numbers.   SG- Paul George. All I want here is a 3 and D guard. For me it‚Äôs a coin flip between PG and Klay Thomson. I went with George because he has better handles and a much higher peak defensively. George would also be willing to be a role player and not need to dominate a locker room.  PG- John Stockton. GOAT passer, most efficient guard of his era, and I get a bunch of free possessions off steals. Also a great teammate and doesn‚Äôt need to score more than 15 ppg, which is important in this exercise.   I didn‚Äôt consider anyone who wasn‚Äôt at least an all-defense level defender nor anyone 1-4 that wasn‚Äôt a great 3 point shooter. If I can be this picky I‚Äôm not having any weaknesses on my team."
"I went looking through the advanced stats, focusing on the top 30 single season rankings for PER, Total Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus and VORP. A couple folks jump into the All-time Top 25 conversation.   I was a bit surprised at how many top notch regular seasons Kawhi has had-- I tend to think of him as a playoff monster. But he's a dominant contender for bursting into the all-time ranks. And Giannis is already coming on strong, too:  **Kawhi Leonard (2017 &amp; 2021 PER, 2019 Win Shares, 2016, 2017 &amp; 2021 Box Plus/Minus, 2019 VORP)**  **Giannis (2020 PER, 2020 Box Plus/Minus, 2021 VORP)**  Chris Paul, Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis each have had dominant years that could be considered top 25 all-time:   **Chris Paul (2008 PER, 2008 Box Plus/Minus)**  **Damian Lillard (2021 PER, 2021 Box Plus/Minus)**  **Anthony Davis (2020 PER, 2020 Win Shares)**  I'm not sure if Dirk Nowitzi and Dwayne Wade are already considered top 25 all-time, but based on their dominant year in 2006, they probably should be:  **Dirk Nowitzki (2006 Win Shares, 2010 Box Plus/Minus, 2006 VORP)**  **Dwayne Wade (2006 Win Shares, 2010 Box Plus/Minus, 2006 VORP)**  But all of those folks are probably not big surprises, and will probably be in the top 25 debate eventually, if they're not already. The one that I think really forces his way into the conversation is Anfernee Hardaway, who had a dominant year in 1997:  **Anfernee Hardaway (1997 PER, 1997 Box Plus/Minus)**  There were other players who had dominant years in these categories, but not appearing in the top 30 in more than one category.

He did it three and a half years into a 5 year deal. James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, etc These guys have all done the same thing in recent years. Can you tell me who their agents are?"
"I mean they took a gamble on KP that I think was the right move. It was also basically just last playoffs he looked bad, he was playing insanely well in the second half of the bubble year and had a pretty solid regular season this year. KP was pretty much the best star player they were gonna be able to get with their limited trade pieces and THJ was a great addition to the trade. What would you have done different? Mavs still had a max cap space this offseason even with KP and it‚Äôs not like they are an attractive free agent destination. Also reminder, Luka has lost twice in the first round to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Atlanta beat a young NY team and a dysfunctional choking Philly team.

Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Kawhi Leonard  Raptors fans know we are just trying to build our own Kawhi.
In what way? When he aquired him from OKC or tried but failed to get him from the rockets? Also it's James harden (that in and of itself makes the comparison redundant).  This to me leans a bit closer to Kawhi Leonard when he wanted out from the spurs. Injury concerns and other extracurricular stuff absolutely tanked his value. The spurs focused in what they wanted to do and got it done and moved on. Both approaches are going to draw criticism.  So it's not exactly going out on a limb and also poking fun of when simplest rebuilding tools is made to look fucking revolutionary. But so far we have a record of it being a way to build a culture of losing. Now Philly almost broke that mold and credit to them to be forced to cut the shit and being a bounce away from potentially having a chip.  Also I'm not looking to make a thing of it. It's just a joke peeps chill.

I don't know, it's an iconic play but it bugs me that this shot always seems to get included in these butterfly effect moments. If he misses the series gets reset back to a 50/50 proposition. That 50% win probability is big but the teams fates didn't end up swinging *wholly* on that shot like they did for Ray Allen, Durant, or even the Mike Conley shot that rimmed out against the Nuggets."
"I like how we‚Äôve watched harden literally 1v1 the best defenders in the league with ease and yet this shit still gets upvoted.   If harden can score 30 while being defended by Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, trust me, he will no problem dropping 150 on random bums off the street."

"I guess i have never seen anybody call dame a wing or PG a guard but maybe thats just me  Anyways id say that just because you have two ball dominant players doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that story behind their true shooting percentage can be ignored or that the comparison is automatically valid  The fact of the matter is that Dame gets much more defensive attention than PG does and doesn‚Äôt have the talent around him to help alleviate the burden he faces. This dude gets face guarded at half court and trapped on almost every pick and roll. This leads to him having to take shots under heavy pressure more often which impacts his efficiency. PG on the other hand plays beside Kawhi Leonard and multiple good shot creators/ 3&amp;D guys so his shot quality tends to be much higher. If Dame was in those scenarios, his efficiency would skyrocket   I think PG13 is a high level all star caliber player but Dame is one of the best offensive players in the nba right now so i just don‚Äôt really see the comparison."

Bill Russell, 80s Rodman, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Ron Artest, 2014-2017 Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Giannis, Ben Simmons  Bill Russell would have struggled in the three point era, but at the time he played he single handedly shut down the best player on the other team. Was usually a center, but in his prime no one had an efficient night against Bill."
"Dennis Rodman had trouble guarding Hakeem Olajuwon, too. It‚Äôs not easy to shut down Hall of Fame offense. KD averages 27 points a game when he plays against Kawhi Leonard teams. Kawhi can still guard the 3 and the 4."
"What was his supporting cast like that season?  - He had Dwight Howard who averaged less than 14 PPG   - Trevor Ariza was solid, but still averaged only 12.7 PPG   Everyone else averaged less than 10 PPG   Patrick Beverly, sophomore Clint Capela, and Donatas Motiej≈´nas who was out of the league half way into next season.   In terms of a season drop off, Kawhi Leonard took a big jump and the Spurs were great. OKC who was injured in 2015 was healthy"
"Nah, sorry that is bullshit.  I agree that the Raptors most likely don't win if the Warriors dont get decimated.  But last year was a real outlier for playoff team injuries, particularly important/star players.  Just off the top of my head:  Clippers: - Kawhi Leonard (best player on team) out injured  Lakers - LeBron and AD out or dealing with injuries   Nuggets - Jamal Murray, Will Barton, PJ Dozier  Nets - Crippled Harden playing on one leg, Kyrie out.  Hawks - Trae Young tweaks ankle in game three against Bucks  Jazz - Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out or dealing with injuries.  All the serious contenders suffered injuries to one or more of their most important players.  The Bucks did great and earned that ring. But to suggest that injuries played no part is dishonest rubbish."
Kawhi Leonard wishes he was as much of a fun guy as Giannis.
"You sure Kawhi over DeRozan had nothing to do with it? DeRozan shot 47% TS on 16.8 points (8 turnovers on 11 assists), which is embarrassing compared to the historically efficient playoff performances by Leonard (and the defense). Also Gasol, improved Siakam/ FVV, and Danny Green played huge roles for the Raptors as well.   Curry has gone 10-0 against Blazers whenever he played, with ridiculous averages (we're talking near 40 points on 70% TS). His record high of 62 points is against the Blazers. The blazers sub literally has Curry PTSD. LeBron is famous for sonning the Raptors with Kobe post moves but he only went 58% TS on 34 points that series."
You‚Äôre literally using a defensive metric that says Kyle Kuzma and Seth Curry are better defensive players than Kawhi Leonard. If that doesn‚Äôt tell you defensive metrics aren‚Äôt shit I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I‚Äôm 90% sure you‚Äôre trolling here though.

"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
They had legit like 9 40% shooters plus Kawhi Leonard on that team. They had an absurd amount of shooting
"That‚Äôs an embarrassing haul for a generational talent of Kawhi Leonard lmaoooo.  Both can be true. You got lowballed, and it was an embarrassing haul"
"Your logic makes no sense at all though. If the Clippers began to think Kawhi could become available then surely they'd have started making moves to put together a trade offer. That's what teams do. Instead the Clippers put themselves in a position where they wouldn't have anything to offer, and in fact never even engaged in trade talks. The idea that they *knew* in January of 2018 that Kawhi would sign with them as a free agent in July of 2019 is just ridiculous. The Spurs themselves didn't know Kawhi wanted out until June of 2018. I don't know how you can read [an article like this one](https://www.expressnews.com/spurs-nation/article/Players-not-counting-on-Leonard-returning-12771179.php#photo-15194190) from March of 2018 after Kawhi was around the team for the annual team photo with quotes from the players about him and think ""at this point the Clippers have known for two months that Kawhi will eventually sign with them in free agency over a year from now."" No offense, but your whole theory is just ludicrous."
"Poor Pop had to make do with Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Kawhi Leonard, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. Too bad they never got him any talent."
"Wtf? That‚Äôs not even remotely close to what I‚Äôm saying.  My argument is that he didn‚Äôt have Michael Jordan AND Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal AND Kobe Bryant. When Michael got old, he got Shaq. When Shaq left, he still had Kobe.  When Tim Duncan got old, Pop had who? In 2014, Pop coached a team with a 37 year old Tim Duncan and only 22 year old Kawhi Leonard to a chip. That team had NO PLAYER average 17 ppg or 30 min per game.  That team had less star power ANY of Phil‚Äôs championship teams. They won the championship against one of the best teams ever assembled, the prime Lebron James Heatles. And they won with a great system built by Gregg Popovich. They didn‚Äôt rely on a triangle offense with MJ or Kobe or Shaq. They won with a perfectly built motion offense, a selfless team culture, and as Magic Johnson described it ‚Äúsmart fundamental basketball.‚Äù  That‚Äôs my argument. Hope that was easier to understand"
You‚Äôre talking about the guy that had 3 different MVPs. One of those guys was Michael Jordan who is widely believed to be the GOAT.  Pop had 5 rings in 3 different decades with only 1 team. 1 of those rings (2014) was with a team that had no player average more than 17 ppg or 30 min. Tim Duncan was 37. Kawhi Leonard was 22. That team beat the Lebron James (also arguably the GOAT) Heat.  It‚Äôs not in dispute. Gregg Popovich is the GOAT

"Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶  Ok nevermind, sixers still might have looked better on paper lol."
"Do you think the Suns weren't dealing with injuries all year also?  Booker had an injury to his shooting hand during the season that hampered him all year, Dario saric had a major injury that kept him out for a large part of the year and then we lost him permanently in the finals, cam Johnson probably our best shooter injured his shooting hand during the season and it affected him tremendously until he was healthy in the playoffs, DeAndre Aiden injured his ankle last year and we aggravated it this year and was hampered by it during the regular season all year and he injured his shoulder during the season which bothered him all season and reinjured it during the playoffs.  Campaign got hurt during the playoffs and Missed time.  Why were those teams dealing with injuries, oh I don't know maybe because Anthony Davis has been injury prone his entire career, maybe because kawhi Leonard has been injury prone his entire career maybe because LeBron passed his prime and is a giant human being who plays an ultra athletic play style.    Not only did they all get a huge break in the middle of the season to allow their bodies to repair, but they were all load managing to help keep them fresh for the playoffs.  One could argue that this year teams had the most preparation for the playoffs than any team previously.  Players wanting time off to help prevent injuries used to be taboo, now it's the norm."

"No, it isn‚Äôt bias. Luka is just a better player than Trae, as you yourself even just admitted. Sure, Luka isn‚Äôt a good defender but by being 6-7 he is able to eliminate a good number of mismatches that Trae isn‚Äôt privy to.  Luka works in a significantly different offense and style of offense than Trae. This is a significantly more heliocentric team and because of that he faced defenses that played against him using box and ones. In addition to that, he faced the defense of Patrick Beverly, kawhi Leonard, and Paul George. If you put Trae on the Mavs, it‚Äôs not going seven and you know it. You‚Äôre making it seem like i said Trae is a bad player, he isnt, he‚Äôs spectacular, but Luka is better. What makes you think you‚Äôre absolved from bias, do you consider yourself omniscient? Because you‚Äôre sure coming off like it."

"If his jumpshot was a dynamite as Jordan's, it's odd that his percentages don't remotely suggest that they were.  He averaged 38.5 FG% between 10 and 22 feet.  Compared that to elite mid-ranger Kawhi Leonard, who's hitting 46.1 FG% from that same distance.    Iverson's averages are only slightly ahead of LeBron's, who's been known as a mediocre mid-range threat for nearly his entire career."
Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson. Why is the prevailing assumption these guys will be good and consistently available when they next play?
And you will be missing the gravity of one Kawhi Leonard over the course of the season meaning your other players on the floor alongside PG will be guarded and watched more intensely.

"I was at a Raptors game vs the Charlotte Hornets the year the Raptors won the title. I took a good look at Kawhi Leonard as he was walking at Scotiabank Arena. Tried to say hi, but he ignored us.   Kemba Walker was also at the arena that same night. I knew about his impending free agency and I shouted him out for carrying the Hornets while he was waiting at the elevator to rejoin his team. He thanked me and I wished him well afterwards. He was such a chill guy"
More people watch NBA games then WNBA games. Again nothing to do with personal lives.   Kawhi Leonard makes millions and people don‚Äôt even know he has kids. So he can‚Äôt be getting paid because he takes pictures out in public.
"&gt; Which opposing stars do you think Rudy Gobert is slowing down?  I'm going to reverse this question and spin it back to you.   With the injuries to Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard taking the Nuggets and Clippers out of play, who exactly do you think is taking advantage of Gobert in the Western Conference with a 5-out offense that is as proficient as either the Nuggets or Clippers offenses were?   Please list me the teams in the West that you think can play Gobert off the floor, I'm all ears."
"I‚Äôm calling you out for saying he was soft spoken.   That‚Äôs something you doubled down on.   You might as well say Kawhi Leonard is a loudmouth with a take like that.

Hilarious that you keep responding to everyone, at this point shouldn‚Äôt you just downvote and move on instead of reply to everyone disagreeing with you while complaining about it?"
"Kawhi Leonard.   Dude went from being a projected role player to a 2 time finals MVP capable of turning any team with him on it into a contender.   He went from a guy that needed to learn how to shoot, to one of the most prolific mid-range shooters in the league today."

"If you want to stop/contain the other team‚Äôs best player, then you want Kawhi‚Äôs style. So against s team with 1 superstar and not much depth, you should def take Kawhi‚Äôs style.  If you need to disrupt multiple players on a deep, then you go with Giannis‚Äôs style.  But that‚Äôs their styles. In terms of the player, you obviously choose Kawhi Leonard. Giannis is a great defender, but Kawhi Leonard is DIFFERENT. The way opposing teams deal with Kawhi‚Äôs defense is by making the players guarding stay FAR away from any action and take him out of the play entirely and try playing 4 on 4 instead."
Can someone p/s Simmons head on John Collins  baptism of Embid?   Then have the gif of him falling away after Kawhi ‚ÄòBen Simmons‚Äô Leonard hits the jumper in his eye.
"I think he just hates the media, you don't go running around making commercials and movies if you hate the spotlight.  He posts frequently on his social media platforms, he goes on multiple podcasts... Kawhi Leonard on the other hand makes more sense in avoiding the spotlight.   A person doesn't go around saying the earth is flat, anti-vax rants, if they don't want the attention."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard"
No Kawhi Leonard - rest of the list is void
They *tampered to get Kawhi Leonard and are now a free agent hot spot.
Kawhi had a lot of growth transition to a primary scoring option but he was always Kawhi and most of the league (and Spurs fans) knew he was great. It was the non Spurs fans on this subreddit that resisted the thought of him being that guy.   All the pundits were gushing over Leonard by the end of 2014 while this sub was convinced his ceiling was Shawn Marion. SI had Kawhi as 10th on their top 100 list and everyone here freaked out. The narrative pushed here was that Kawhi was some regular 3nD guy and because the Spurs system was so awesome it only made him look like a star.
They were literally gifted Kawhi Leonard and are now a free agent hot spot. I don‚Äôt understand your thinking here.
Kawhi Leonard ([projected growth based on trend](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/944/071/0a0.jpg)).
"Yes. OG Anunoby is already one of the best wing defenders in the league, and arguably the best as Zach Lowe aka NBA Reddit God among others have argued. I don't think comparing OG who is arguably the best wing defender in the league right now to Ron Artest who was arguably the best wing defender in the league during his prime is very far-fetched. The jump that would be required to reach that ceiling would be on the offensive end, not on defense where he is already one of the best of not best wing defenders in the league. OG is already there on D.  I also don't think putting his realistic ceiling as prime Ron Artest offensively is far-fetched either. Ron Artest was not some offensive dynamo with crazy handles and was NBA Jam on fire. Ron Artest was a secondary/tertiary level scorer who struggled with efficiency from three and in general, had a rudimentary handle that was kinda shaky but allowed him to take advantage of his size and strength (billed at 6'6 244lb at the draft, 6'7 260lb during his nba career) to score and play off of another scorer for a spot up, cut or secondary action like a side PnR. Being a more efficiency Ron Artest who during his prime was an 18.5PPG scorer on low efficiency isn't exactly high praise. It's not like I'm saying his ceiling is Kawhi Leonard or something. OG is similar, in that he also has a rudimentary, shaky handle that has limited him offensively but has shown flashes last season and so far in pre-season of it developing enough to let him take advantage of his size and strength to score (did you not watch the Celtics Raptors preseason game?) in a similar mannor to Artest while also being a high efficiency player (for his career, 37.5% from three including one season of 39.0% on 3.3 attempts and 39.8% on 6.1%, career 58.7% with the last two seasons being at 60.0% and 60.5%). Clearly he isn't at that point yet (that's why its a ceiling) but last season he was at 15.9PPG for the season and after the All Star break where he got a bump in touches due to Northman Powell being traded bumped that up to 18.3PPG vs his 13.8PPG before the All Star break. That was also with basically no change in efficiency, going from 47.9/39.5/75.5 on 60.7%TS to 48.0/40.1/81.6 on 60.3%TS. Even if he were to just stay at his post All Star averages of 18.3/5.2/2.8/1.5/0.8 on 48.0/40.1/81.6 with 60.3%TS, that lines up with my realistic ceiling of more efficient prime Ron Artest offensively. Remember, for his six season prime, Ron Artest was at 18.5/5.6/3.5/2.0/0.6 on 42.6/35.6/73.0 with a 52.0%TS. Similar slash numbers to Prime Ron Artest but with better higher efficiency."
Kawhi Leonard with less drama. Im kidding but Raps fan sees him like that. People can dream. Maybe 65% Kawhi or 85% Jaylen Brown
Kawhi Leonard?
"Dude, if Wiggins can at least somewhat handle Kawhi Leonard and LeBron fucking James, OG is not gonna be too much to handle. He‚Äôs both worse and less strong than them."
[According to Woj that's exactly what happened.](https://news4sanantonio.com/sports/spurs-zone/spurs-reportedly-would-not-trade-kawhi-leonard-to-lakers-no-matter-what)
Nah the player known as Kawhi Leonard who happened to play in Canada. But hated it so much he didn't want to defend his title. Couldn't be my franchise GOAT.
"Kawhi Leonard sir, he can part time you to a championship"
They really rated Draymond Green above Kawhi Leonard...what?
"Dwight Howard at 47 over Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnet, and Dwayne Wade at 52, 54, and 62 respectively is underrated.   Dennis Rodman at 18 stands out as maybe the most egregious thing on the list. Jason Kidd at 29 is pretty close though."
"&gt; Crazy stat: Kawhi Leonard won more playoff games in his first two years in the NBA than Carmelo has won in his entire career.  That's what happens when you play for a Spurs dynasty led by Pop, Timmy, Manu and TP. It's not like Kawhi was the reason they won those playoff games. He wasn't even good until his 3rd/4th year."
Crazy stat: Kawhi Leonard won more playoff games in his first two years in the NBA than Carmelo has won in his entire career.   Obviously this doesn‚Äôt really mean much in terms of who had the better career but it shows how important who drafts you matters. If the Pistons drafted Melo he could easily have double his current playoff win total.
"Yes, thanks to Kawhi Leonard."
&gt; He had KP and Trae went further in the playoffs   Luka very close to alone nearly beat the duo of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard in a game series. Trae is a great talent but there's very few players you could replace luka with and get as close to beating the clippers as mavs did
Kawhi Leonard gave away tens of millions by not signing a supermax with the spurs. Same with KD and OKC. He has a point.
1. Kobe Bryant  2. Allen Iverson  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Tracy McGrady 5. Nikola Jokic
"1. LeBron James  2. Penny Hardaway  3. Russell Westbrook  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Tayshaun Prince  HM: Tmac, Rip Hamilton, Zeke, Steph"
1. Derrick Rose 2. Kyrie Irving 3. LeBron James 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Kawhi Leonard
"Mine would be:   1. David Robinson 2. Manu Ginobili 3. Tim Duncan 4. Tony Parker 5. Kawhi Leonard   But to make it interesting, I‚Äôm gonna leave the obvious Spurs greats off, so it would be:   1. Steve Nash 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Allen Iverson 4. Dwayne Wade 5. Scottie Pippen"
The same team Clippers team had Kawhi Leonard putting up 41 points on 81% TS in Game 2 and still lost.
"You gave the Raptors a 10/10 cause of a Klay injury even though we were outplaying them even with Klay and a KD injury in which he should have never played a single minute of that series. But you then forget the Suns played a Lakers with an injured Anthony Davis, Nuggets with an out Jamal Murray and the Clippers with an out Kawhi Leonard. If you care so much about Klay and KD being injured, be consistent when it comes to the Suns who were at best the 4th best team in the West. Either injuries matter, or they don't."
"Yeah, people acting like AD is the most injury prone star in the league are not being realistic. Look at AD compared to these other top 10 players with how many regular season games they've all missed over the last 5 seasons.  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old"
and Kawhi Leonard as strength and conditioning coach
"If you were completely and utterly ignorant about the fact that Kawhi Leonard himself had one of the greatest series performances ever, maybe"
"I saw Kawhi Leonard at an IHOP in Atlanta one time. I‚Äôm about 6‚Äô5‚Äù and he was a couple inches taller than me, but what surprised me about him most was how sleight his frame is. Like I‚Äôm barrel cheated and my body is long, but his body looked small and his arms and legs were long.   I made eye contact with him and nodded and he just turned away lol"

"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"The last 2 champions won mainly because of defense.  You are greatly underestimating AD on offense. AD has more 40 pt games than any active player in the NBA lmao.  Lets use another example. Kawhi Leonard.  Technically, jokic is better than kawhi offensively. But anybody rather have Kawhi on their team. Cause he is a better 2 way player.  Offense is not more important than defense. They are both equally important.   Basketball is half offense, half defense.  AD and kawhi are pretty much on the same tier of production with what they offer except kawhi can space the floor more. But AD also has better handles so sort of evens out.  Anyway my point is, yes, on paper jokic is better. But in an actual game, when the game counts, you can rely on AD and kawhi type players to play amazing defense while also putting up great offense. Where as jokic is more 1 dimensional. Obviously his defense is above average but its no where near AD and kawhi. And out of all 3 , ad is easily the best defender. Finished top 2 for DPOY in 2020.   Anyway have a good day. At the end of the day jokic gotta play defense"
"Not just an elite offensive player, Boban has been the single best player per minute in the NBA. Boban is the per 36 god monster.

"There's a handful of teams in the league that should never be trading multiple future first round picks, and the Timberwolves would be one of those teams. They've been in the top 10 for over a decade - they're going to start trading a bunch of future picks for friggin Ben Simmons like they just got kawhi Leonard in free agency?  It didn't even work out for the clippers, what chance do the wolves have?  Sounds like a really terrible idea to me."
"Yep, just trade the guy already...  **10 NBA Superstars Who Forced A Trade**   NBA players switch teams all the time, whether through free agency or a trade. Sometimes a player is traded because another team wants them to improve their roster, or because of salary cap constraints. But other times, players get traded because they request the trade themselves, and then end up at a destination that they prefer.    NBA superstars‚Äô trade requests carry a lot of weight. These players are the face of the franchise, and are usually the highest paid players on a roster. If they request a trade, then their franchise usually trades them to avoid dealing with a disgruntled superstar, and in hopes gaining value for the future in return, such as high draft picks. If the franchise holds out, then the player forces a trade using the leverage that they have. Here are 10 superstars throughout NBA history that have forced trades to other franchises:      1. Anthony Davis   2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Wilt Chamberlain   5. Chris Paul   6. James Harden   7. Kyrie Irving   8. Vince Carter   9. Carmelo Anthony   10. Paul George"
"Don't you know it's his fault Kawhi Leonard was injured in the previous round? It's also his fault that Kawhi Leonard stepped on then-Spur David Lee's foot and hit the floor in severe pain before the incident with Zaza, which of course is the only time anyone has ever been undercut in the history of the NBA and wasn't a thing that happened all the fucking time at that point and still happens to Steph Curry with no call.  Zaza is an evil malicious piece of shit who also did everything fully intentionally, including all the times he injured *Warriors* players while a Warrior because he just wants to hurt people, he's not just kind of uncoordinated a lot."
I didn't say I didn't like Kawhi Leonard or Tim Duncan. I just said they aren't alphas. And Draymond is definitely the alpha compared to Curry. Curry taking the most shots doesn't change that
"The loudest guys are so often the beta.  Dominance is a state of being, not something that can be manufactured. You can chirp away all you want but what happens when its time to throw hands?   You dont think players like Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan are alpha personalities? You dont think Draymond is Currys bitch?"
"That statement does not reflect what happened.  [""Leonard was cleared by the Spurs' medical team, but opts to remain out.""](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/04/19/kawhi-leonard-injury-timeline-news-spurs)"
"*Got removed for being a low effort post, so I will put it in the discussion thread.*  **It is ok not to max Ayton NOW, probably even the correct move. Same with all rookie contract players except superstars.**  The important thing is that this does not mean that Ayton will not play for the Suns on a max contract. It just means they aren't giving it to him a year early.      He has 1 more season before becoming an RFA. That means that in the 2022 offseason, the Suns have the ability to offer him more money than any other team, and the ability to match any other team's offer. His only way to get off the Suns, if he wants to, will be to take an immense financial risk by playing on the QO. Even if he does that, he still has to play with them in 2022-23.      So the incentive is really not there to offer him the max now.      **An example of why not to do it:** Andrew Wiggins signed a 5-year max extension after 3 seasons, but had a down 4th year and overall did not improve like the Wolves hoped.      **An example of a team not offering the max:** Kawhi Leonard won the 2014 Finals MVP in his 3rd season, but the Spurs did not extend him. The following offseason, he signed a 5-year max contract and stayed a Spur.      **An example of a team offering less and the player accepting it:** Giannis Antetokounmpo signed a 4-year extension at slightly below the max after his 3rd season."
"He has a point. Look at what getting drafted to a winning team did to.. Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, Kawhi Leonard‚Ä¶  Oh wait."
"You are just wrong here. He might have been injured earlier in the season but he definitely melt it for much longer. Spurs wanted him to play. Even Tony Parker held a players-only meeting and he declined stating his injury. As a loyal Spurs fan, f*** Kawhi Leonard"
"&gt; Why are people here struggling to understand that trade leverage can change over time.  Because it's not based in reality.   Every single instance of teams ""waiting for a better offer"" on a malcontent player has resulted in those teams either getting the exact same offer or worse.  On one side you have case studies such as:  * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * James Harden * Anthony Davis * Paul George * etc etc.  And on the other side of the debate we have case studies such as:  * N/A   ***  &gt; they have to wait until a team gets desperate.   There's also very little reality going on here too.  Historically, the market actually gets worse for sellers as the season progresses. [There's no real history of stars being sold at the deadline](https://ca.nba.com/news/revisiting-some-of-the-most-impactful-deals-at-the-nba-trade-deadline-since-the-year-2000/rk8sg9udnjt416rhzcbyald04) because the market is so grim that most teams looking to sell end up bailing early.  The trade deadline is a buyer's market and it's specifically a market for teams looking for cheap expiring contracts.    It's a terrible market to be selling a max player on a 4-year deal, because most of the league won't even be in a position to facilitate the trade.   One of the main reasons big trades happen in the offseason is because teams giving up big trade packages need all 3 of the draft, FA and buyout periods to restock their roster.    No, the Minnesota Timberwolves are not going to bring in 8 G-Leaguers to pad out their 7-man roster at the trade deadline, especially not if they're ""desperate"" to make the playoffs.     ***  The issue isn't everyone else not understanding. The issue is people mistaking desire for reality.   Just because you want something to happen doesn't mean it will.   &gt; put them in a better spot to win a championship  That ship has sailed.   Dame isn't available, and even if he was, there are other teams with better packages available."
"Just looked up who's the winningest player of all time, it's none other than Kawhi Leonard with 74.5% win percentage.  He's been part of some wicked good teams."
*Kawhi Leonard likes this.*
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
The next kawhi Leonard is on the raptors
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do think Wiggins is a good defender. He has all the physical tools length wise and he‚Äôs a good size. Simmons just does it better. Simmons can guard 1-4 easily. Wiggins isn‚Äôt as capable defending 1‚Äôs (too quick generally) and 4‚Äôs (too strong). You can see this as players like Doncic, Westbrook and Lillard were extremely effective all shooting 50%+ from the field when he was the primary defender. Who he was most effective against was Kawhi Leonard, Middleton and Tatum which displays the limit to his game compared to Simmons. Simmons shut down guys like Mitchell, Westbrook and Lillard, but still shut down Giannis, Zion and Siakam. That shows depth to his defensive game and it‚Äôs a rare commodity in the league."
Bigger Bradley Beal who's a defensive force...so an elite two-way player who can score on all levels and has the size to guard multiple positions. That's goddamn Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard.

"No you're just revising history.  &gt;‚ÄúThe day of the trade at 12 noon the deal was off,‚Äù Rivers said. ‚ÄúI was at home in Malibu and Lawrence called me and told me, ‚ÄòIt looks like he‚Äôs either going to Toronto or the Lakers.‚Äô The Lakers part just threw me over. **I told him that can‚Äôt happen. ‚Ä¶ I remember I kept telling him, ‚ÄòWe cannot allow that to happen!‚Äô**  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2019-09-18/doc-rivers-hero-clippers-signed-kawhi-leonard-paul-george"
Lmao a few years ago the Spurs were worse defensively with Kawhi Leonard on the court. That alone should tell you defensive stats are trash. It‚Äôs well known that defensive stats suck to evaluate players defensively.   I can‚Äôt believe someone is actually saying Curry was an ‚Äúaverage defender (or better)‚Äù in 2015-2016 lmao. How the fuck you going to see tema hunt for him in the clutch and think ‚Äúdamn this dude is an average defender (or better)!‚Äù That‚Äôs delusional.
"How is it bashing Rudy in any way. Randle is balling out against everyone this year, and it is just more impressive he did it against such a big and tough defender.   &amp;#x200B;  If a hypothetical post said something like ""LaMelo Ball scores 25 points mostly guarded by Kawhi Leonard"" would you read that as bashing Kawhi, or impressed by LaMelo's scoring against such a tough defender?"

Rivers &gt; Paul George and Kawhi Leonard.  Doc shoulda had his son clutch the Nuggets for him.
"I feel like his link proves himself wrong. Beverley ranks above Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Damian Lilliard in career 3 point shooting."
The Toronto Raptors should‚Äôve tanked when Kawhi Leonard left that sorry franchise. They would‚Äôve had a chance at LaGOAT Ball. Fans of that sorry franchise cheer when Kevin Durant gets injured. Shameful. Good luck winning a championship the next 10 years Toronto Raptors fans.
" If you are wondering, the last back-to-back in which Kawhi Leonard played both games was April 4-5, 2017"
"Is KaWhI lEoNaRd mIsSinG thE cLutCh GeNe ?  With all due respect, do you know how fucking stupid that sounds?  Ps: your link goes to google images buddy"
"I think the comparison isn't to the current Kawhi Leonard (who is a great offensive player), but rather to early-career Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi was really raw as an offensive player during his first few years in the league."
"Well since i dont want to say the same names that are already said here i think that Luka is one of the best guards in the post.   In his first six games this season, Donƒçiƒá is posting up on 9.2% of his possessions, generating an absurd 1.33 points per possession. It‚Äôs a small sample size (only 15 possessions), but for comparison, the Mavericks are generating 1.14 points per possession in transition. Even more, Donƒçiƒá leads the league by generating free throws on 46.7% of his post-ups. It seems like Donƒçiƒá either scores, gets fouled, or both when he is in the post this season.

"Pop thought nothing of his daily ritual until one morning, several weeks into the bubble, when he got a text from another former player of his: ‚ÄúMorning boss, you good up there?‚Äù The text was from Kawhi Leonard‚ÄîFinals MVP with the Spurs, now a star on the Clippers‚Äîwho was staying in room 850, directly below his old boss. Pop had been waking Kawhi up with his noisy workouts for days, but Kawhi was reluctant to say anything. Pop told Kawhi that he would stop for the time being and joked that he would continue again when the Spurs met the Clippers in the Conference Finals, messing with Kawhi‚Äôs sleep. Kawhi responded with the kind of trash talk that‚Äôs best read aloud in Kawhi‚Äôs dry monotone: ‚ÄúHaha, you know the saying ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt poke the bear‚Äô? I‚Äôm gonna call the NBA on you...ha...ha....ha‚Äù"
Anthony Davis is currently playing better than Kawhi Leonard and has been since last season including the postseason  Not that crazy of a take
Kawhi Leonard
Ask Kawhi Leonard
"George Paul. Kawhi Leonard is doing horribly right now (49% TS?, 20 points) and GP is really carrying the load."
"NBA Finals games and playoff games impress me more than regular season games.  Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the NBA Finals and there are better regular season players than him in the league.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving are better than Wardell Stephen Curry II. Two regular season games against the Blazers and Kings doesn‚Äôt change anything."
Raptors fans told me that OG anonoby was the next kawhi leonard
"The Clippers really need to work on improving their shot selection. So far they've been almost exclusively a jump shooting team with very little actually going to the rim. Currently they are 28th in the league in % of shots taken in the restricted area, and only 20th in the league in % of 2-pt shots being dunk attempts. They're near the top of the league in mid-range shots though, which is probably not ideal, given the low efficiency of such shots. The Clippers have looked good because they've been shooting well, but when their shots haven't fallen, well, just look at that Dallas game. They're gonna have to figure out how to get more scoring inside as a weapon they can go to.  [John Schumann of NBA.com had this to say about the Clippers and missing Trez this year:](https://www.nba.com/news/powerrankings-2020-21-week-3)  &gt; The Clippers scored 112 points on 93 possessions in Phoenix despite scoring just eight points in the restricted area, fewest for any team in any game this season. It was speculated in this space two weeks ago that they might miss Montrezl Harrell‚Äôs rim attacks, and they indeed rank 28th in the percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted area (23%). George and Kawhi Leonard are some jump-shootin‚Äô superstars, having combined to take just 30 (14%) of their 215 shots in the restricted area. In their loss in Utah on Friday, it was just five of 41 total attempts from the pair, and they were 4-for-19 on non-restricted-area 2-point shots."
"Bro you are getting mad at me for calling Harden a top 5 player in the world lmao. I‚Äôm on this sub all the time telling how good of a player I think Harden is. It‚Äôs all subjective but is it wrong from me to think you might be a little biaised being a Rockets fan? At the end of the day, KD and Kawhi both were the first option on a championship team, something Harden couldn‚Äôt do. I hope you guys figure it out in Houston and he‚Äôs able to win a ring there but right now I don‚Äôt see a valid argument that would justify saying Harden is a better player than Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard"
"I thought this was interesting regarding the Clippers:  &gt; The Clippers scored 112 points on 93 possessions in Phoenix despite scoring just eight points in the restricted area, fewest for any team in any game this season. It was speculated in this space two weeks ago that they might miss Montrezl Harrell‚Äôs rim attacks, and they indeed rank 28th in the percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted area (23%). George and Kawhi Leonard are some jump-shootin‚Äô superstars, having combined to take just 30 (14%) of their 215 shots in the restricted area. In their loss in Utah on Friday, it was just five of 41 total attempts from the pair, and they were 4-for-19 on non-restricted-area 2-point shots.  I had heard somewhere on a broadcast or podcast (I think it was maybe on last night's Dunc'd On pod?) that neither Kawhi nor PG has dunked a ball this year, in reference to the lack of scoring the Clippers have had on the interior so far this year, so I found this to be telling.   Looking at bball-ref it looks like the Clippers currently rank 28th in the league in % of shots that are taken within 3 feet of the rim and they're 20th in % of 2-pt shots that are dunk attempts. The Clippers are currently 13th in % of shots which are 3-pt attempts, but are near the top of the league in mid-range attempt %, so they probably will need to work on shot selection as the season goes on.  On that same podcast they were talking about how bad the Clippers rebounding has been, and checking bball-ref it looks like they're below average in both offensive and defensive rebounding rate. That podcast also pointed out how the Clippers were below average in all 4 defense four factors so far this year, so I think they've got some areas to work on, but getting Marcus Morris back might help with some of the rebounding issues at least."
"‚ÄúChris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, and Lou Will never scored 35 points while making 7+ 3‚Äôs while playing for the clippers‚Äù  That‚Äôs basically what this stat says."
"Lol the history of that pick is hilarious. Looks like Masai fleeced that pick from the Knicks twice from 2 different franchises:  - In the Melo trade, while Masai was on the Nuggets, he got the Knicks to throw in a 2016 pick swap. Probably didn't seem like much, the Knicks would surely be good in 2016 with Melo. The Knicks ended up with the #7 pick, and that pick swap moved the Nuggets from #9 to #7 - landing them **Jamal Murray** - In the Bargnani trade, while Masai was on the Raptors, he got the Knicks to throw in the remaining 2016 pick. Probably didn't seem like much, because it was the worse of the 2016 Nuggets and Knicks picks. But it ended up as the #9 pick, which later became a centerpiece for **Kawhi Leonard**"
Kawhi Leonard wasn't the best player of the 2014 Spurs
"This game was basically swung on a 19-0 run to start the second without Devin Booker, Suns made sure [to do a tribute to vintage old school Suns basketball during that stretch](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq9z6l/against_the_clippers_last_night_devin_booker_was/gi2kfs9/)  That Phoenix opponent 3 point shooting luck regresses kinda hard last night   Heat check Paul George game [lot of it was just him flexing like this](https://go.nba.com/21z4) not much you can do. This isn‚Äôt a good matchup for Phoenix because they lack too many wings you are comfortable putting on Paul George and kawhi beyond crowder and Bridges. The guy who honestly did the best job on PG last night was maybe Chris Paul which isn‚Äôt ideal. Bookers defense has been better this year [but he isn‚Äôt ready for this responsibility chasing guys through screens isn‚Äôt his strength](https://go.nba.com/14n8) neither is reacting quickly in space [and rotating](https://go.nba.com/n19p)  This was interesting there was atretch in the 4th last quarter last night you look up and you see......small ball center Kawhi Leonard as the Clippers lineup [taking away that rim from Cameron Payne](https://go.nba.com/troi). Something you‚Äôll see in the playoffs maybe   Response was pretty cool from Phoenix Saric helped lead the comeback at the end of the 3rd. Bridges and Crowder did what you want vs Kawhi Leonard he wasn‚Äôt getting to the basket a ton. Suns didn‚Äôt get great offensive looks in the half court last 5 min when it wasn‚Äôt Booker pushing off misses that helped seal it."
Yeah. These were the odds   Luka Doncic +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo +425 Stephen Curry +500 LeBron James +700 Anthony Davis +700 James Harden +800 Kawhi Leonard +900 Kevin Durant +1000
Is it time to be concerned about Kawhi Leonard?
"Steph Curry. As great of a defender as Kawhi Leonard used to be, he's only been a real MVP level player for three seasons (four if you're being generous and wanna count 2015-16). Repeating as MVP is also way more impressive than repeating as DPOY."
So now you know Curry now has a higher career high than:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Damian Lillard  James Harden  Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal  Anthony Davis
"Despite the efforts of Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers win"
I know you're Kawhi Leonard... but you gotta let PG shoot there
I think it's safe to say that the clippers go as PG goes which is crazy since he plays with Kawhi Leonard
When the opponent 3 point shooting regresses back to the mean(if your Phoenix)  This also isn‚Äôt a great matchup for Phoenix because outside of Bridges and crowder aren‚Äôt many great matchups to put on both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard
It‚Äôs not just 6 games. I think Brown is Kawhi Leonard 2.0 I‚Äôve always been high on him
Guard - Kyle Lowry  Guard - Tracy McGrady Wing - Vince Carter  Wing - Kawhi Leonard  Center - Marc Gasol  That‚Äôs my uneducated guess.
"Yup..    1. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  2. Luka Donƒçiƒá, Dallas Mavericks  3. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  6. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  7. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  8. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  9. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers  10. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat  11. Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics  12. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets  13. Russell Westbrook, Houston Rockets  14. Nikola Jokiƒá, Denver Nuggets  15. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies"
"Imagine a lineup of Kawhi Leonard, Siakam, Lowry, with a guy like FVV off the bench. Maybe we could trade Baynes/Len for Gasol too. That would be a squad."
"I think a lot of basketball fans in general take the extremes too far on both sides of the coin lol.     When Pascal Siakam wasn't struggling Raptors fans were comparing dude to Kawhi Leonard and pretty much making it an assumption he'd be that good.     Now he's going through a period of struggle - I point back to his year where he went 1/31 from 3 for a month. When dude slumps, he sluuuumps.      Maybe he comes out of this one, maybe he doesn't - but either way Raptor fans are doing their best to try and run him out of town."
Kawhi Leonard
"Kevin ‚ÄúGOAT Finals performer‚Äù Durant because he actually shows up in the Finals, unlike other superstars (excluding Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard)."
"How many more random players are people gonna be link to us?People literally make these threads just to dump on the Celtics.   Threads made just to dump on Celtics/Danny Tracker:  Should've traded for:  ~~Paul George~~  ~~Jimmy Butler~~  ~~Anthony Davis~~  ~~Kawhi Leonard~~  ~~James Harden~~  Should've drafted:  ~~Collin Sexton~~  Yes, instead of trading an injured IT &amp; the no.8 pick for Kyrie, we should've kept it. Sub would still dump on us for hoarding assets  Or Imagine if we did trade for Kawhi or AD as basically 1 year rentals &amp; didn't win a thing. Sub would absolutely sh*t on Danny Ainge for trading JB   And absolutely no one on here would praise us for going for it"
"He is a top 15 impact player as measured by PIPM, RAPTOR, RAPTOR WAR, Win Shares, RPM, VORP and Total Points Added. Only six other players in the entire league were unamimously top-15 in all of those metrics, and those six guys were all serious MVP candidates: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic  In football terms Spida is like a flashy wide receiver. Gobert is the entire offensive and defensive line.   Remove gobert and we are the 2017-2018 Suns, (Mitchell being our Booker), 15 more losses a season and never cracking the playoffs"
"Wow you‚Äôre smarter than most people on this subreddit.  Kawhi Leonard is top 3 though. In what world are Luka Donƒçiƒá, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Joel Embiid better than Kyrie Irving?  Decent list, but not perfect."

"To not waste more gas with you since you are quick to dismiss reality, Utah will remain a perennial 6-8 seed whose realistic objective is to get to second round. This is the squad that you will call ""full of difference makers"".  Jrue Holiday (a reserve all star just like Donovan ""Kobe"" Mitchell) Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis as well as Paul George and Chris Paul were all traded for Role players and that's just in the last two years.  I would've gone for Chris Paul, or Jimmy rather than the corpse of Mike Conley when they had the chance.  If going to the second round to lose 8/9 games is what you call doing more, I'm intrigued to see what you call doing less.  I take it that this year ""since they have Bogi"" they'll win two games in the conference semi finals and pat one another in back ."
"I don‚Äôt know, but that Denver ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù isn‚Äôt winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokiƒá is a very overrated player. I‚Äôd rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, or Joel Embiid than Nikola Jokiƒá. It‚Äôs close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."

"&gt; But the rebuild is gonna take longer than Steph has to wait.   There is no reason to trade Steph, or Klay, or Draymond.  None.  You rebuild with them on your team.  Why?  Look at the phoenix suns.  How did they go from a good, young nucleus of talent to translating that into wins?  There are other teams, like the Timberwolves, the Bulls, the Pelicans, and etc. that have good, young nucleuses that have not been able to translate that talent into wins and losses.  Why?    The biggest difference I see on the Suns is Chris Paul.  The Suns were a good story in the bubble, but they are a good team right now.  Bringing in Chris Paul, a guy who knows what to do and where to be to win close games, and who has played in and won many close games in his career, is having a big effect on the suns.    Young players need mentors, and not from coaches all the time.  Locker room leadership is a real thing.  The wolves have tons of talent, and they can't win.  Why?  The Bulls do, why?  There's no adult in the locker room.  The Bulls starting lineup is younger than the University of Wisconsin's starting lineup.  That doesn't work.    These young players keep going down this path, they will pick up bad habits that they will not be able to break out of even later in their careers.  At a point, a player's career hardens, and you are what you are.  For most normal people, that switch happens at age 24 (according to behavioral psychology).  It is absolutely crucial that you get good mentorship before the age of 24, or you're sunk.    Now, look at the Spurs.  They never had a plethora of top 10 draft picks.  After Duncan, Genobili and Parker, they had one top prospect for a period of about 20 years: Kawhi Leonard.  One top prospect was enough.  Why?  Because Kawhi had the fortune of starting his career in a place with absolutely the strongest locker room ever, he was surrounded by guys with championship rings.  He was a young rookie who learned to do it the right way.  The reason why the Spurs must rebuild now is because they've lost that locker room.    Having that veteran locker room, of players who have won rings in the past, can massively increase the probability that your draft picks pan out and become stars.    The best argument for NOT trading Curry, Thompson or Green is James Wiseman.  Do you want to give him the BEST chance to harness all of that freakish natural talent he has into becoming a generational talent?    Let him learn the RIGHT habits when he's 19 years old, from Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Kevon Looney.  Let him learn from 4 other players in the same locker room who have 11 championship rings between them.    You want to maximize the chances that those two top 20 overall selections in a loaded draft the warriors will have in the summer of 2021 pan out into terrific, foundational players?  Give them the right MENTORS early in their careers.    Most of us, in this life, never had a mentor when we were young, so our lives become a series of distractions and we spend much of our existence running in place, always trying hard, without ever getting anywhere.  That's due to our habits.  Young players learn by mimicking the habits of their older peers.  If you have a locker room full of young players who care about their social media standing and their brand, guess what those young players will pick up on?  If you have one dedicated to being unselfish and to winning, guess how those young players will grow up?    If the objective is to get the warriors back to contention as quickly as possible, trading Steph, Klay, and Draymond is about the worst thing you could do.    Meyers did the right thing in 2019, he kept the four foundational locker room players, and swapped out everyone else."

Our best player every season is Kawhi Leonard.  Paul George is a regular season player and his style of play does not contribute to a playoff team against playoff defenses with his usage so high.
"If you bring multiple teams to championships, it's fair to say that the rings chased you. Rings chased prime Shaq, Lebron, and even Kawhi Leonard with that Raptors win, IMO."
&gt; [The Lakers are willing to include former No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram and a future first-round pick in a package for Leonard](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks)   At the time I thought it was stupid they didn‚Äôt take this package.

"""Kawhi Leonard in the corner getting the 4th quarter software update"""
It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing to celebrate regular season wins against Kevin Durant. I don‚Äôt even know if the Hawks make the playoffs this year. The Hawks aren‚Äôt going to continue shooting like this and their opponents won‚Äôt miss open shots every game.  LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard probably have a winning record in the regular season against Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant destroys them in the playoffs tho.   Stay delusional Atlanta Hawks fans. You might be worse than Warriors and Lakers fans.
Kevin Durant doesn‚Äôt lose to Kawhi Leonard. Kyrie Irving doesn‚Äôt lose to Kyle Lowry.  Nets in 4.
"I‚Äôve Decided the Clippers everyone! Love Kawhi Leonard, would live in LA and love the colours and jerseys of the clippers so I‚Äôm a clippers people"
Kawhi Leonard is better than Anthony Davis.

"The best way to judge how good players are defensively is to look at their ability to stay in front of their man and regain ground on a shot if they are beaten. The leagues best defenders get beaten, but the best way to judge a defensive possession is individually watching the matchups, the ability to contest without contact, foul at the right time and create turnovers are all accurate measures of a great defender. Some of my favourite defenders to watch are Jrue Holiday, Jae Crowder, Bam Adebayo &amp; Kawhi Leonard, they all defend differently, but they are the best defenders in the league if you ask me."

Randle retires as the all time scoring leader for the Detroit Pistons at age 45.  Lebron james takes multiple years off with league permission at the end of this current contract. But it‚Äôs made clear he‚Äôll come back and sign with whatever team draft‚Äôs his son. Ends up retiring at 47 but bronny jr never could beat Julius.    Kawhi Leonard doesn‚Äôt retire but instead just sorta will show up randomly on random teams for the next 50 years.   Durant? Durant got really into the 60s and no one ever saw him again.
Trae Young  Kawhi Leonard  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Jayson Tatum  Bam Adebayo  LaMelo Ball  Are the only current players winning an MVP in their careers
"&gt;Mine has to be that Tim Duncan made a record 15(!) All-Defensive teams in his 20 year career, but never won a single DPOY.   This shouldn't be very surprising, since Duncan was never a DPOY-level defender.  When you look at the Spurs' history, you find that they were consistently excellent and even the top-rated defense:   * with David Robinson before Duncan was drafted,  * with both Robinson and Duncan,  * with Duncan and Bruce Bowen,  * with Duncan and Kawhi Leonard * and with just Leonard, after Duncan retired  However, with just Duncan alone, and none of those other excellent defenders, the Spurs were mediocre defensively for those three seasons -- 8th, 10th, and 11th in the league.  It's pretty clear that Duncan was riding the coattails of his teammates when it comes to defense.  Duncan alone, without at least one All-Defensive teammate, resulted in very unremarkable defense."
"Kwame Leonard, great grandson of Kawhi, will be an all-star in 2077"
Kawhi Leonard.
"All time?  Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan  *(I started watching basketball in the 2000s)*  Current: Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid"
"**TEAM PACERS (with a twist)**  Billionaire Bruce Wayne sells his corporation and buys an expansion team, complete with an alternate timeline version of the Indiana Pacers.  Current teammates Paul George and Kawhi Leonard prove that -- while social media may hate them right now -- they can fit like a glove on virtually any roster in the league. They provide some excellent perimeter defense that, coupled with Myles Turner, leads these new Pacers to one of the best defensive ratings in the league (finishing # 2 overall.)  Offensively, the team can get caught up in some ""iso ball"" at times, but they manage to get bailed out by Kawhi Leonard's ability to win in those situations. The Pacers end the league year with the # 1 seed out East. The question from here is: will they step up when it counts? Or will PG+Kawhi fold once again?  Round 1 is easy, with the team sweeping the Knicks. In round 2, Boston doesn't provide much more resistance, with another 4-1 win for the Pacers.  The Eastern Conference Finals appear to be more of a challenge, as KD, James Harden, and Kyrie arrive in town ready to test that top-tier defense. Kawhi and Paul George gamely step up their games, but James Harden manages to create some foul trouble for them that limits their minutes. The Nets go up 2-1. Game 4 is even worse, as Kawhi Leonard runs cold and Paul George goes 3-13.  Now down 3-1, it appears as though these Pacers may be folding. However, they do have some aces in the hole: PG Malcolm Brogdon has emerged behind the scenes as a key leader for them, encouraging them to stiffen up and fight their way back into the series. Brogdon even steps up his share of the offense, bullying smaller Kyrie Irving and going for 19-7-8 in a Game 5 win. Kawhi and PG find their rhythm again in Game 6, leading to another win! The team has officially tied it up, 3-3!  Going into a pivotal game 7, everyone looks tight. The offense is slow -- stagnant at times -- and perhaps relying too much on one-on-one play. T.J. Warren tries to do a little too much of that, coughing up 3 turnovers in a game where he should probably be in a background role. In turn, the Nets get hot beyond the arc with Joe Harris hitting 4-7 threes. The Nets end up pulling away and winning this one 115-107.   Afterwards, the Pacers are disappointed, and wonder how much could have changed if they had the full effect of homecourt advantage. Alas, COVID had other plans in mind this particular season."
Why does Kawhi Leonard playing for the raptors feel like it happened 10 years ago already lmao

"Charles Barkley asks Kawhi Leonard if he's seen anything different between Charles and Shaq.  Kawhi's response: ""Ringz Erneh."""
Can you not help off of Kawhi fucking Leonard in the corner? Holy shit the IQ is nonexistent.
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don‚Äôt think Chris really belongs here, but I think he‚Äôll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he‚Äôs my pick to make it."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
"You mean the guy that was considered the 2 times finals mvp. was seen as the better player on the same team and was ranked higher by kerr himself while on the same team is not the better player. Kd has also been elite for way longer and is not a defensive liability.  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.

"An idea I had that gained some traction yesterday was this. It assumes the Clippers flame out in the playoffs and Kawhi doesn't want to re-sign.   Warriors get:   * Kawhi Leonard  * Ivika Zubac  Clippers get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman  * Minnesota 2021 1st  * Warriors 2023, 2025 1sts  * Warriors 2022, 2024 pick swaps  Clippers could trade PG and other pieces for loads of pick and jump start a rebuild overnight.   Meanwhile the Warriors run Curry/Klay/Kawhi/Draymond/Zubac with Lee, Oubre, Paschall, JTA, and Looney off the bench. That's a great 10 man rotation and an easy finals contender  I don't have the 2027 1st or a 2026 pick swap in the Warriors offer since it would be a situation where Kawhi/Warriors have leverage over the Clippers, so I don't know if giving that extra value would be needed. But they could be included if need be"
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"Ah shit I understand now. You're one of those plastics who joined the GS train AFTER they started winning.  So here's an exercise for you. Go back before 2015 and read upon the FS record and the atrocity that was Monta Ellis (don't know if you even recognise the name). At the same time, watch the Spurs records and how we're one of the most successful franchises of all time. Delusional fan calling us mediocre lol.  As for the sweep, only you GS fans adore Zaza 'I suck as as a player and can't do shit' Pachulia for the crap he pulled on Leonard. Your ass was getting busted by Kawhi before Zaza pulled that shit."
#FUCK KAWHI LEONARD
He made total sense for a team planning on keeping Kawhi. Spurs would have been deadly if Leonard stayed.
"Players on different teams can talk all they want directly to each other. Lebron could walk up to Kawhi Leonard, tell him he should leave the Clippers and join the Lakers next year and it would be completely fine.  The only player I remember getting fined for tampering lately is Draymond Green talking about Devin Booker. But that was a tricky situation, he was fined moreso because he did it in his capacity as a TNT analyst."
"Danny ‚Äúalmost traded for prime Westbrook, prime Blake, PG-13, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden‚Äù Ainge"
"[https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/12/watch-kawhi-leonard-buzzer-beater-takes-4-bounces-eliminates-76ers/](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/12/watch-kawhi-leonard-buzzer-beater-takes-4-bounces-eliminates-76ers/)  Take a look at that photo. LOOK AT IT. Joel BARELY leaves his feet to defend that shot. Of those final 4 seconds, Ben Simmons, who had enough vert and height to block the shot, was on him for 3.5 seconds, but Embiid stepped in last second, botched the defense, and pretty much is the reason why the sixers lost.  Not to mention the whole team let Kawhi walk all over them all series, with that being the nail in the coffin. Thanks for the lazy defense Joel, and thanks for the shit coaching, Brett Clown. I hope you never coach an NBA game again."
It was his long lost twin brother Kawhi Leonard.
"Also Heat: Now that we're on the topic of Kawhi Leonard, how is that man not yet playing for our team?!?!"
Heat: You mean Kawhi Leonard? There are no Leonards on the roster
i think something about kawhi leonard playing videogames?
"If we get Kawhi Leonard, we're sweeping through the playoffs."
"Purely on ball: Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Tony Allen, Kawhi Leonard, Alvin Robertson"
"ben wallace, tony allen, jrue holiday, kawhi leonard"
Only they didn‚Äôt.  I can‚Äôt find full stats for series but Ben was primary on him after game 1.    https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-ben-simmons-76ers-slow-down-kawhi-leonard-raptors/m1ls8ye30eu41hxmedoe2ftbu  found this after game 2.
Jokic is a funny human.  Kawhi Leonard is funny as a human.
"Man I just read Leonard at the end and thought it was Kawhi and just like : wait hold up, kawhi said something? On a livestream?. And then read the title again lmao"
Honestly kawhi Leonard makes me laugh alllllll the time and he‚Äôll be doing something regular as hell. That‚Äôs a funny human
"Not to discredit Ben's defence, but I don't get how being a hyper versatile defender is even a relevant counter to what Kawhi dealt with?  The [Kawhisolation style defence](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/) wasn't built on taking advantage of some idea that Kawhi was limited in his matchups.  So how would Ben's versatility be an answer to that style of defence?  Lowe comparing Kawhi being kept away from the ball handler and Simmons being a versatile defender is pretty much two entirely separate conversations.   Being a 1-3 defender or a 1-5 defender doesn't change whether you'll be dragged out to the corner while a secondary star does all the work.   And that's before we discuss prime Kawhi being about as versatile as Ben currently is.  &gt;He held his own against LeBron. How many 6' 10'' guy can shut down Dame?  I'd be very comfortable with Prime Kawhi on either LeBron or Dame."
"Kawhi Leonard. Kind of hard to hate that guy, unintentionally funny."
Did this guy really put Ben Simmons in the same sentence as Kawhi Leonard ?
"What actually happened (according to ""supposed"" sources) is that during the LA Clippers pitch to Kawhi, Doc was going over a list of players that he and the FO thought would be a good fit next to Kawhi. Kawhi (mistakenly or misled by Doc's presentation) thought that this was a list of players they could for sure get. Then he basically went ooh I like PG, and then Doc and FO was like damn okay we gotta go get PG. This is also why OKC was able to drive a high price, even though they had planned to break up PG Westbrook  &gt; That led to the Clippers presenting Leonard with a list of potential trade targets, but Rivers said there was only one player he wanted to join forces with: ""We just showed him guys that we thought would match him and when he saw Paul George's name he said, 'I want to play with him.' We showed him everybody else and he didn't want to hear it. He just stayed on Paul George.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2854416-doc-rivers-talks-clippers-recruitment-of-kawhi-leonard-trade-for-paul-george"
Not one GOAT James. Not Kawhi Leonard.
Kawhi Leonard is officially a Brooklyn Net.
"No idea what endorsements he has, but it's not like shoe deals are exclusive to Los Angeles. What's funny is you can go to New Balance and see the Kawhi Leonard ""Neo Flame"" and it screams Miami to me, not Los Angeles.  That's generally beside the point, though. The difference in cost of living and taxes in CA balances out some large chunks of money that he might be getting in endorsements. He could probably have gotten quite a few anywhere he went. Staying with Toronto, he was basically getting all of Canada as a marketing opportunity."
"Nah, you just don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. You‚Äôre a fool if you think Anthony Davis is on the same level as Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant as a scorer."
that is allegedly Kawhi Leonard.  we don't know for sure because no one has ever seen him.
Imagine thinking Kawhi Leonard is more valuable to a Clippers team that has Paul George than Stephen Curry is to his Warriors team.
"I guess Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, and Kawhi Leonard are just scrubs huh?"
  Nobody is trying to pay $400 for some shit seats when the Clippers come to town and then just get to watch Kawhi Leonard sit in the bench.   this is why nobody cares if these guys are taking HGH or roided up.
"Being a lifelong Spurs fan, I‚Äôll always love the guy. When Kawhi gave up on us, LA dragged us to the playoffs while Leonard was missing from the bench. Couldn‚Äôt appreciate all he did for us any more."
What IS Kawhi Leonard?
"I don't know if there are underrated so much as the spotlight just isn't on them, last year they had all the hype as soon as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George signed, Kawhi Leonard had the New Balance commercial calling it his city, and had a good co-star with him and they did a lot of talking to where we all were looking forward to the ""Battle of LA in the Conference Finals"".......oooops            Long story short I don't think it's so much that they're underrated, it's just that you nobody's going to put that money to believe in them like they did last year nor have they earned it"
Kawhi Leonard will be a DNP - Coach‚Äôs Decision for next game. We all know his humor matrix needs calibration
"When all is said and done, Kawhi Anthony Leonard will have a better career than Dirk Werner Nowitzki."
After Toronto won the Championship with Kawhi Leonard taking a 1/3 of the regular season games off for load management.  Teams are gonna have players rest in the regular season in the hopes it gives them an edge in the playoffs.  The season is too damn long.
"Fuck it, Kawhi Anthony Leonard is winning it."
I have a feeling Clippers might fuck around and win a ring this year. Kawhi Leonard is hard to beat come playoff time
I think Kawhi Leonard has something like 3 tweets ever haha
Teams aren't even lying about injuries anymore or using 'load management' language. The Clippers for example have been listing PG and Kawhi out for 'rest'.  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/kawhi-leonard-is-out-against-detroit-pistons  https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1380636885953867776  The Nets listed Kyrie out for 'personal reasons' last game: https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1381346934909194241
Best league ever  1 - Anthony Davis + LeBron James  2 - Giannis Antetokounmpo + Luka Doncic  3 - Joel Embiid + James Harden  4 - Nikola Jokic + Kawhi Leonard  5 - Kevin Durant + Steph Curry  6 - Rudy Gobert + Jimmy Butler + Damian Lilard  7 - Bam Adebayo + Paul George + Kyrie Irving  8 - Karl Anthony Towns + Jayson Tatum + Ben Simmons  9 - Draymond Green + Devin Booker + Chris Paul  10 - Kristaps Porzingis + Zion Williamson + Donovan Mitchell  11 - Clint Capela + Jaylen Brown + Bradley Beal
"Idk if you noticed but Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green were not on the Spurs for most of Duncan's career lol.  And even though the 2017 Spurs were elite on D, they got ~2 points worse on D from 2016 despite almost no roster changes besides losing old man Duncan."
"Harden has played 34 games for the Nets.  James harden is not in MVP discussions due to anything he did in Houston (which is 8 games) where he was out of shape and was making a scene to get out of town.    Kawhi Leonard has played 45 games for the Clippers this year, which is even more then harden even if you do count those 8 pre season Rocket games, and substantially more when compared to his Brooklyn time"
Also Kawhi Leonard does this almost every time he get the ball in the post but never gets called for it.   I remember last year in the playoffs against Mavs he shoved Maxi in the chest with his elbow and faded away and it was so blatant and didn't get called.
"A 2 minute internet search is all you need to forever condemn the evil in the above mentioned areas of the world. Many conflicts are hard to understand. Those aren't hard to understand. The problem with the masses is the lack of willingness to ask questions and look for answers. Anyone playing in the NBA has a social media account, except maybe Kawhi Leonard, but I promise you they have heard and know about it but say nothing or are heavily influenced to only talk about BLM. Race is irrelevant, white players also talk about BLM and aren't black. Your ability to comprehend right and wrong does not have anything to do with skin color."
"PG - Chris Paul (my pass-first point god, JKidd-like) - era 2000s  SG - Kobe Bryant (i'd go with Kob, rather than Mj the goat) - era 90s  SF - Kawhi Leonard (good matchup with Bron) \*my next go-to-guy behind Kobe - era 2010s  PF - Tim Duncan (can use his bankshot to stretch the floor) - era 90s  C - Dwight Howard (prime monster at Rebounds &amp; Blocks) - era 2000s  6th Man - Klay Thompson (off ball, perimeter defender) - era 2010s  &amp;#x200B;  Coach: Larry Brown (DET &amp; PHI tenure)  System: Defense-oriented, Free-flowing offense  underrated at all cost,"

Kawhi Leonard getting ready to exercise that player option and go to NYK.
"The thought of private, quiet Kawhi ""Load Management"" Leonard going to the New York Knicks to play for Thibs is pretty funny."
a sign and trade can only be for one player and maybe some picks. 100 out of 100 times toy give up Mikal for Kawhi Leonard
"Yeah imagine being the LA franchise that's had a winning record for 10 straight seasons (the longest active streak in the league) and several All-Stars (Blake Griffin x5, Chris Paul x5, DeAndre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard x2, Paul George) and 6MOY winners (Jamal Crawford x2, Lou Williams x2, Montrezl Harrell) ...  Yet has never made it to the conference finals and sadly plays second fiddle to the other LA team that had six straight losing seasons over the same timespan.  Just brutal."
I think he's trying to purport that Leonard is not as much of a leader as he is a player (Seeing as Kawhi was on both of those teams). I have no idea why he's phrased it like that tho.
"I mean luka can cook pretty much any big in the league going downhill or 1 on 1 but Ibaka would provide a lot more flexibility defensively like being able to play up on screens or trap/hedge, as well as give rim protection which they literally have zero of in their closing lineups right now. Both games 1 and 2 theyve given up multiple wide open dunks/layups at crucial points down the stretch. Ibaka is still a very good defensive presence who would be a gigantic upgrade over Marcus morris kawhi Leonard at the 5 lineups they're closing with right now"
"Of course. Any ""trade Paul George"" possibilities are contingent on Kawhi Leonard not re-signing, which I think he will."
They lose in finals and sign Kawhi Leonard.
"They need some elite wing defenders to put on Luka, someone like Kawhi Leonard or Paul George"
Lol they have Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and yet you‚Äôre still right. Insanely good for such a young player
He really went from   Kawhi ‚ÄúFinals MVP‚Äù Leonard to Kawhi ‚ÄúDespite the loss‚Äù Leonard  Oops :)
Future Warrior Kawhi Leonard. Steph and Klay'll take good care of ya
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the game and Beverly is the one defending Luka. Embarrassing lol
Friendly reminder that Kawhi Leonard has run out of gas by the end of the second round the past two playoffs
"Kawhi Leonard slipping into KD, Kyrie, and Harden's DM's after the game."
Kawhi Leonard is going to Brooklyn.
Nobody yoyos in and out of the top 5 more than Kawhi Leonard and if they win this I'm assuming we're putting him back in
Did you just say that Booker is arguably better than Kawhi fucking Leonard? Lmao what
"Kawhi Leonard scoring 60 points every game in the first round, bold strategy, we shall see if it works."

""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."" also he once said ‚ÄúI would say Kevin (Durant) is ... when you factor in everything, size, speed, athleticism, I think he‚Äôs the most talented basketball player I‚Äôve ever seen in my life,‚Äù Kerr said.  ‚ÄúIt was more just a level of basketball that I‚Äôm not sure had ever been reached before.‚Äù"
That's already Kawhi Leonard
PG: ‚Äò17 Kyle Lowry  SG: ‚Äò01 Vince Carter  SF: ‚Äò19 Kawhi Leonard  PF: ‚Äò20 Pascal Siakam  C: ‚Äò10 Chris Bosh
Lol SAS always makes up the dumbest stuff about Kawhi.  Just like when his ‚Äúclose sources‚Äù said allegedly Kawhi Leonard said Lebron James can‚Äôt guard me
"clippers were switching everything. they ran picks for luka so he'd get favorable matchups. zubac, beverley, anyone not named leonard or george... lue said kawhi will guard luka more this game, so we'll see I guess. But it won't matter if they're going to keep switching everything anyway."
"So, to start, I agree with you that a lot of this is that Luka's great at forcing switches, and is a sufficiently dangerous shooter (and is surrounded by enough dangerous shooters) that it's difficult to just look at minutes guarded 1:1 as a metric.  That said: LeBron's notorious for doing that in the regular season to conserve energy and avoid injury. In the postseason, especially when he was younger, he frequently took the most difficult defensive assignments while also carrying his usual massive share of the offense. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask stars, especially guys like George and Leonard, where defense is part of the calling card, to take the heaviest load on both sides of the ball in the postseason. That's why they make the big bucks.  Watching the game, it didn't appear that the Clips were throwing PG and Kawhi at him nearly enough. They were letting switches take them away from him, and there didn't seem to be a concerted game plan or effort to have one of them on him at all times, which did seem weird. I think it's reasonable to ask what the thought process was, because I don't know what the point of having those two guys on your team is if it's not ""find the best offensive player on the other team and lock him down""."
"https://quayhealth.com.au/kawhi-leonard-quadriceps-tendinopathy/  I'm diagnosed with the same condition that this MD believes Kawhi has, jumper's knee. Got it from a combo of vertical jump training a couple of years ago + reduced mobility in my ankles due to high-ankle sprains on both sides with no PT (reduced mobility, makes knees absorb more shock). (FWIW, coincidentally I'm about the same height as Kawhi with the same vert, not that relevant but a bit more context on this N=1 case study lol.)  In my experience, it doesn't have that much of an affect on performance. It's an absolute fucking *bitch* when you're *not* competing, as odd as it sounds. I still have it and feel like I could hoop right now at 100%, but every morning the knees hurt like a MFer, if you sit for 5 minutes then go up the stairs they hurt, hell even driving (unable to extend the knees) makes your knees start hurting like a MFer.   But if he can deal with the off-court stuff, I don't see him being really hampered by it for quite a while. The chronic pain takes an obscenely long time to truly go away, so his long-term recovery can't begin until retirement, but again, it doesn't have much of an effect on performance."
Kawhi Leonard 2: electric boogaloo
Paul George Vs Kawhi Leonard
do they have 2019 kawhi leonard?
"hasn't commented in two weeks period, and hasn't commented on r/nba in nine months  come on here and says shit like:  &gt;watching him straight give up in various games throughout his career because coming back, while feasible, was going to be hard  led the greatest comeback in nba history so that doesnt even make sense  &gt;being too scared to take the final shot in many game deciding situations  scared? you mean.. making the right basketball play??  &gt;LeBron is the Trump of basketball  lol  &gt;Give me Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, or Kevin Durant over LeBron any day of the week  lol  this sub is brigaded on any popular lebron post with ridiculous takes like this"
"I watch a pretty decent amount of basketball. And I get what you mean.  However..... Kawhi Leonard doesn't flop.  In fact, he probably should show a little more that he is getting fouled. He has little if any reaction to getting fouled."
Kawhi Leonard 2.0 just waiting for the trade of Mitchell and Clarkson to a team that instantly wins a chip the next year
Kawhi Leonard 2.0
Kawhi Leonard 2.0
"Danny Green carried Kawhi Leonard to multiple championships, I think he deserves some respect"
You don't think Kawhi Leonard will be playing when he's Lou Will's age? Lmao
"See that's kind of missing the whole point of the 04 team tho. Like all due respect to the 19 team, they were underdogs who overachieved like the 04 Pistons but bringing up defensive stats, hell stats in general is missing the point of what made the 04 Pistons special.   In fact y'all had a superstar in Kawhi Leonard which is opposite of what Detroit had. Plus, even with Kawhi staying, I don't know if they could dominate the east the way that Detroit did."
Pacers legend kawhi leonard
You're right of course. But let's compare him to Kawhi Leonard anyway LMAO
"Harden is just about tied with Luka, while Dame rounds out my Top Ten.  Book is right around that range, too.  1. LeBron James 1. Stephen Curry 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1. Kevin Durant 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Luka Donƒçiƒá 1. James Harden 1. Nikola Jokiƒá 1. Joel Embiid 1. Damian Lillard"
"That is absolutely not the definition of forcing a trade. It's the definition of an expiring contract. It's how expiring contracts work. You have the option to either keep the guy, or trade him and get whatever assets you can for him. Melo just gave them the benefit of having complete information. How would they be better off if he pretended he was considering staying?  Did Kawhi Leonard force a trade from the Raptors when he made it pretty clear all along that he was planning on signing with an LA team after the season? No, they decided it was worth it to keep him for a year and let his contract expire, and won a championship that year. You're not forced to trade a guy whose contract is expiring.  Carson Palmer retiring rather than playing for his team is forcing a trade. James Harden being as toxic of a teammate as possible is forcing a trade. Telling a team you don't plan on re-signing is simply giving them the ability to make an informed decision and get themselves the best outcome possible. They can do what they want with that information."
"You think that because you‚Äôre a Lakers fan, and Lakers fans thought they would get Kawhi for cheap.      &gt; With LeBron officially agreeing to sign with the Lakers, it‚Äôll be fascinating to monitor what type of leverage the Spurs can create for Kawhi Leonard, who still desires to play for the Lakers, according to multiple league sources‚Äîall of whom say offers to the Spurs have been underwhelming.  &gt;One executive said the proposed packages have gotten worse with each round of negotiations, while another said they‚Äôre flat-out unacceptable.       The Spurs didn‚Äôt get an amazing package, but three of their starters in the play-in game were acquired in that trade: Derozan, Poeltl, and Keldon Johnson."

paul george and kawhi leonard both were not at training camp last year
"Pg is nothing to doncic.  Kawhi is the only one who can make him uncomfortable.  Not Morris, George, of course Jackson.  Maybe rondo can but haven't seen it.   Same as kleber, finney Smith cant make Leonard uncomfortable at all.   Way I see it is kawhi has to guard him especially in 3rd and 4th"

"As much as I loved seeing the 2016 Warriors be dismantled, The 2020 clippers choke  I‚Äôm really hoping this clipper team is eliminated. I can‚Äôt wait to hear the Kawhi Leonard and or Paul George have demanded a trade  You clipper fans will pay for the bullshit that was lob city"
"[The Raps W/L without kawhi was good, but it should be taken with a grain of salt.](https://raptorsrapture.com/2019/07/29/toronto-raptors-17-5-record-without-kawhi-leonard-misleading/)  And if i‚Äôm picking a player to build around, I take Kawhi ten times out of ten. Kawhi isn‚Äôt a ball dominant guard that‚Äôs going to drop 50 point triple doubles, but he‚Äôs can put up 25+ ppg while also playing some of the best defense in the league.  If you need to win one possession on either side of the floor, Kawhi can get it done.  Harden has better defense than 4 years ago, but he‚Äôs still not a plus defender.  And when he‚Äôs hot, he‚Äôs unstoppable, but when he‚Äôs not, well, he‚Äôll shoot you out of the game. Kawhi, otoh, is just so goddamn efficient."

Was that Kawhi Leonard asking why quicksand work so slowly in a Hyundai commercial?
Kawhi Leonard makes Tim Duncan look like Dave Chapelle. Dude is flat out devoid of personality or likeability.
But everybody loves watching Kawhi Leonard posterising.
"Because Zaza took out prime kawhi Leonard and the warriors blew them out for the rest of the series, Whether you agree or not that‚Äôs the reason."
"Couldn't have traded for Anthony Davis with Kyrie Irving on the team and he wasn't interested in playing for the Celtics, a team with Anthony Davis and essentially nobody else (because Brown/Tatum+Smart would be gone) would get nowhere.   Kawhi Leonard is the only one that I think is maybe possible, but that's just hindsight bias. It took a lot of things lining up just right for the Raptors to win - KD getting injured, Klay getting injured, etc. Also he left anyways and if just one of KD/Klay weren't injured things would be different. Also they didn't really have to give up anything for Kawhi, just Derozan and a first round pick. Spurs wanted Brown and Smart from us and if things went differently that would look like one of the dumbest trades of all time (losing Brown/Smart for nothing and having Kawhi leave afterwards with no championship to show for it.)"
Anthony Davis and kawhi Leonard. I‚Äôd of much rather had one year of championship contention than the potential of jaylen brown. Franchises are way too worried about potential than winning right now.
"On a team that has both Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, their best match up to Luka is.... Pat Bev?"
"The run was amazing I‚Äôll give you that, but I feel it was hyped up so much by emotion. After he hit the miracle shot it started becoming irrational. People were so caught up in that moment, and that Disney like narrative that he started getting credit he didn‚Äôt really deserve. It felt like destiny. He became a household name basically overnight. Teenage girls were tweeting about Kawhi Leonard lol. I feel like the rest of the Raptors got no credit and it all went to Kawhi like he was 90% of the team, when in reality he was like 30% of the team."
"Kawhi leonard: 1/4 from the field in the 4th, 0/2 from three. 4/12 fg in the 2nd half"
"True but he maybe could have picked a better ""star"" to play alongside. LBJ's throwing lobs to Anthony fucking Davis while Kawhi Leonard has Paul George to defer to."
Where is everyone crying that kawhi vs Luka is not real and Leonard is just so superior?
"No, it‚Äôs not something as trivial as mental. They‚Äôre not optimizing Kawhi‚Äôs strengths; Kawhi Leonard is an iso monster with great defence, not an all-around star like Harden, Luka, LeBron, etc. The Clippers need to pair Kawhi with a star playmaker (e.g., Lowry, TP). That‚Äôs the proven formula to build a championship roster around Kawhi Leonard."
"Because the Clippers expect Kawhi Leonard to facilitate and dictate the offence when that isn‚Äôt his game. He‚Äôs in the KD mold, players like him need a playmaking co-star. It‚Äôs really not that hard to grasp."
Best player on the planet Kawhi Leonard down the stretch ladies and gentlemen. Man that one year of hype sure went by faster than a fart.
Kawhi Leonard is overrated and riding on his reputation
"Can't wait to start the ""Kawhi Leonard is overrated and riding on his reputation"" narrative after this series."
I have to ask permission from Kawhi Leonard first.
"Kawhi Leonard shoulda never recruited Pandemic P, he needs a star playmaker. Imagine Kawhi x Luka üëÄ"
‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs all ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù till Kawhi Leonard murders a man on national television‚Äù

Kawhi Leonard got the most casual but savage posters lmao
KAWHI LEONARD
"Yeah, I'd say Luka is definitely better than 2x DPOY and 2x finals MVP Kawhi Leonard because he has more points than him in the first half of game one."
"Kawhi ""I'm not going to LA without PG"" Leonard."
"LeBron: ""Congratulations to Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers for making history by making the Western Conference Finals for the first time ever.  Now we will make history by having a Los Angeles vs. Los Angeles Western Conference Finals for the first time ever.  Then I will make history by emerging victorious in this historical matchup and ending your historic run.  And Kawhi, you will know your place as a footnote in MY history, the history of the greatest of all time."""
"Ah yes, NBA Superstar Caris LeVert who has been competing for the title of best player in the league against the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard."
You know who barely gets criticized? Kawhi Leonard. That dude gets to choke away a 3-1 lead and everyone just shits on Paul George. It's kind of sad tbh
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
"Even if they wanted to trade Kawhi they're not fuckin trading Kawhi Leonard for that worthless sack heap of a trade package, lmaoo"

Yeah it also helps when you trade for kawhi leonard in his prime and he turns into michael jordan during your playoff run  We'll never know the answer for sure but IMO dwayne casey could have won the championship with the same roster that nick nurse did
Literally Kawhi Leonard lol
No.   (Unless the player in question is Kawhi Leonard. And it's not like the Clippers would do that trade straight up so it's not even worth discussing)
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"Just Marcus Morris, Montrezl Harrell, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George."
"This is the correct take. Both teams got better but at the end of the day, the clippers are the more talented team and won last year so of course they should be favored against the Mavs. That doesn't mean the Mavs suck or couldn't beat any of the top 4 teams in the west, it's just really hard to beat a team with Kawhi Leonard and PG, especially considering they addressed the issues from last year."

Kawhi Leonard     \&gt;Walks In  \&gt;Saves his team from elimination   \&gt;Doesn't even smile  \&gt;KING
I think most people want him to stop crying and complaining. Kawhi Leonard just went out there and dominated and didn‚Äôt need to talk at all to do it. I‚Äôd much prefer Doncic take after Dirk and cut the unnecessary theatrics out of his game instead of acting like a child and having some very ugly losses.
"Yes. LeBron is washed king now. Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Nikola Jokic are clearly better than him right now."
Oddly this makes me like Luka and Leonard more. The game they just played--and this comment. It's sort of surreal how Kawhi will just start taking over a game and somehow it still feels subtle and quiet. Like you're getting stabbed in the ribs from different directions and can't feel it because you're in shock.
"I can confirm, my analysis tells me Kawhi Leonard is still quite good at basketball."
Been a fun/stressful duel between Kawhi ‚Äúwhy tf won‚Äôt you miss‚Äù Leonard and Luka ‚Äúhow tf did you make that‚Äù Doncic
So what do you have to do on Sunday? We have to get a Win-Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Paul George, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Reggie Jackson."
"Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving"
Sound familiar. Now you just need a Nick Nurse and Kawhi Leonard for the championship.

"The Sunday Afternoon Delight: Afternoon of Determination  The swift Los Angeles Clippers have cut through the Pacific seas look to attempt the impossible: make it rain in LA.

"However it ends, this series has been fantastic, and i can't wait for it to be over, my blood pressure can only take so much.   Luka is obviously a star, but god damn do i love THJ, bit gutted he's showing out against us but i love his game.  Also, Kawhi. God. Damn. Leonard. I'd watch his midrange game 7 days a week and twice on sunday. Role players need to step up if we go any further. GG mavs"
A top 3 player you mean? Oh that‚Äôs right he has KAWHI LEONARD.
"As a neutral fan, this series has been phenomenal. Kawhi Leonard heard everyone talking shit and is putting up some GOAT-tier numbers this series"
Kawhi Leonard is Lukas bad boy Pistons
"I think they would have gotten him at a discount once they lost at getting Kawhi Leonard. Remember the Lakers were retaining cap space for him that was used to sign.  Your point even emphasizes why Magic Johnson letting him walk was so dumb, because they would have birds rights on Zubac and wouldn't need to use the MLE to fill a center spot."
Every time Kawhi Leonard begins his shooting motion I literally breathe a sigh of relief.  The man is absolutely automatic.
Kawhi Leonard is good at basketball

Cant believe this sub had the nerve to say Luka was better than 2 TIME FMVP Kawhi Leonard. This sub embarrasses itself daily.
"I just said it was low for his standards. No one is acting like Porzi≈Üƒ£is has been incredible. All we see are the same recycled takes that he's garbage, and he's actually been pretty average this series. Just a horrible matchup for him and he's been doing whatever is needed for the team. Also him being a max player is not the point. All I said was he's having an average series and not been atrocious like some folks who only read the boxscore are saying. He's looked great tonight fwiw.   If you've watched the games, you'd see that Ty Lue is putting Paul George and/or Kawhi Leonard on him every possession. Their goal the entire series has been to shut out KP and allow Luka and THJ to beat them. Luka and THJ decided to go nuclear from 3 though and it's led to us up 3-2."
"If I‚Äôm Kawhi Leonard, I‚Äôm making Paul George walk back to Los Angeles. Then I‚Äôm breaking off the same leg that he broke a few years ago and then beating him to death with it."
I am convinced Kawhi Leonard is a basketball deity
"""Fine, I'll do it myself"". Kawhi ""Thanos"" Leonard"
If they lose this kawhi leonard is going to strangle Paul George in the locker room while balmer holds playoff p down.

Kawhi paused for a 2nd then remembered he is Kawhi Leonard then drilled that mid range.

"for real. He's completely taken Kawhi Leonard out of the game with his gravity. Our entire gameplan is use Porzi≈Üƒ£is as a decoy to draw PG/Kawhi out and let Luka score. As a Porzi≈Üƒ£is fan, it's frustrating to watch, but we are winning and we are doing better when Porzi≈Üƒ£is is on the court.   So just because he's not averaging 25 ppg, folks think he's been atrocious."
"Who's beating the All-Cancer team.  PG: Dame Lillard SG: Brad Beal SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Zion Williamson C: Rudy Gobert   With a bench of: Ben Simmons, SGA, Tobias Harris, MPJ, Steven Adams, Bam Adebayo"
But does he have kawhi Leonard have?
Well he‚Äôs not Kawhi Leonard
"Well, I have to say... playoffs have been fun af this year.  Truly what sports fans needed.  How can the feeling be exacerbated you ask?!  ELIMINATION OF PLAYOFF P AND KAWHINE LEONARD  (idek if kawhi whines, it just seems right. ty)"
"Kawhi Leonard receives far too much undeserved praise. His handling of the whole situation in San Antonio was slimy as fuck, and the PG trade is shady as well. He gets lauded for things that people would hate Lebron or KD for"
Is that why him and [the clippers](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2020-08-15/healthy-kawhi-leonard-paul-george-support-clippers-belief-win-nba-title%3f_amp=true) said he was healthy to start the season last year and then only played 60 games? He is the only player allowed to rest mid season and come back fresh for the playoffs. Also he‚Äôs just a shady dude. Fuck him
"If the Clippers lose this series, it will be because nobody beyond Kawhi Leonard and Reggie Jackson can hit a three. In general they're not as good of a shooting team as the Jazz, but man have their shots been wide open more often than not."
"This play was hype as hell and all the announcers had to say was ""Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard..."" Come on."
Clippers superstars Kawhi Leonard and Reggie Jackson
I‚Äôve been in a Thai Prison for 10 years.  Is Reggie Jackson and Kawhi Leonard the superstar duo for the Clippers ?
He yelled at kawhi when he put up that ugly ass 3 to close game 5 against the mavs and Leonard had him benched.

Hi not to sound like a narc but who‚Äôs kawhi leonard?
"A lot of things could have transpired but we have to go with what we have.  Leonard could have hit 5 bounces and spin out and we lose in OT against Philly. Every single player that has gone to the Finals or has come close said you often need a bit of luck.  People downplay how we won but GSW **swept** Portland that year. GSW beat Houston without KD for 1.5 games.   I can tell you how it we had the most line up changes in the NBA in 2019 (also in 2020). We had a huge overhaul roster change mid-season, balancing load management where we wouldn't know when Kawhi would play or not.  Like it's unfortunate KD and Klay went down but we beat them two times in their court, the same team that wiped the floor against Houston and Portland. It's not like we had a cakewalk, 76ers went down to the wire and we were down 0-2 against Milwaukee. Lowry had a banged up thumb the entire series and Leonard had knee problems throughout the series, only time will tell when they release the full story of our championship run. It was not pretty, watch the Rachel Nichols interview and you could sense there's a lot of shit we went through."
"Lol you know you‚Äôre wrong when you have to misrepresent shit this badly. Nobody is saying that he was trash, just that he wasn‚Äôt this all-time great monstrous postseason performer until he joined the core of a 73-9 team. If you put LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard on those Warriors teams they‚Äôd look just as incredible, if not more."
"&gt;‚ÄúWhen Kawhi [Leonard] left Toronto‚Äîother than Chicago, that‚Äôs my favorite city in the world, [but] I‚Äôm never going there again,‚Äù  It's okay we'll just make the playoffs for a couple years and then trade for a mercenary to win another championship"
"Own team bias aside, Philly/Clippers would be a great finals. It's what I want more than any other. Kawhi Leonard, two years after the world-famous...well, thing, and Doc Rivers in the Finals in his first year with a new team against the team that fired him.   For real though, the fact that these playoffs have been wide open so far (well, these eight) is a very welcome change, especially since at least one team will have a shot at their first title because nobody still alive in the West has one."
"Logan's All-NBA Second Team ballot from last year:  * Leonard, Kawhi  * Ingram, Brandon (only 2nd team vote) * Drummond, Andre  (only vote)  * Westbrook Russell (one of 9 2nd team votes) * Young, Trae (only second team vote)  He had Booker and Beal on his Third Team, leaving Lillard and CP3 entirely off his ballot. He also gave LaVine his only vote, leaving off Tatum and Butler."
"Super interested in how PG and Leonard respond to their game 1 performances, and how the clippers role players play as well. Clips role players were playing incredible, I expect a drop off from that. PG and/or kawhi gotta have a big game of that happens.  On the other end, I‚Äôm hoping Joe jingles tonight, and Royce keeps up the energy and aggression. We need them in the same form."
"I‚Äôm perfectly fine at math.  I‚Äôm gonna say the coaches with analytical departments and more knowledge on how the game works just might be smarter than you. I don‚Äôt know. Might be a hot take.  As far as my math goes, I know that say, Kawhi Leonard, being on the bench for 5-6 minutes in foul trouble will be worse than 3 points. And that being said, future challenges also could be 2 point, or 3 points, or a 4 point play. So you have NO CLUE. Just clueless."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
this guy really imagining kawhi leonard going to splash mountain on the weekends
Oh now Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry aren‚Äôt stars at all? Next are you going to tell me that Siakam was actually paraplegic the whole time?
I have been more critical of royce than most but im not sure anyone guards kawhi leonard better than he does
"Bingo, making it your primary objective to target Kawhi instead of getting a good shot will fuck up the offense mightily, the benefits of better shots heavily outweigh the benefit of a more tired out Leonard."
Kawhi Leonard is an idiot üíØ
It all depends. I'm sure a guy like Kawhi Leonard has a larger than average schlong. But that doesn't mean a guy like Meyers Leonard has a massive schlong cause he is 7ft. I think it's more 50/50 than anything.
I highly doubt a Kawhi Leonard led team will get blown out in an important playoff game.
"TBH we sneaked that one in, kept calling everyone constantly trying to trade him, eventually Miami picked up and when we asked if they wanted to trade for Leonard they went ‚ÄúKawhi??‚Äù And we mumbled something unintelligible and forced the trade through before they realized the hoodwink."
"We see this all the time though. Raptors lost game 2 against the Bucks by 25 enroute to a similar 0-2 deficit only to rattle off 4 straight wins. Everyone was counting out the Clippers after they lost both games at home only for them to win 4 of the next 5.   Now I'm not saying the Bucks are going to come back, it definitely doesn't look good, and both of the aforementioned teams had Kawhi Leonard which helps a little. But counting them out because they are down 0-2 is definitely jumping the gun. Yeah being down 49 was embarrassing, but as a wise drawf once said, it still only counts as one."
"It's not so cute and dry though. The jazz really missed that challenge in the second half. There was the Kawhi Leonard up and down where Rudy never touched the ball, or the ball called out on Royce Oneale when last touch was on Paul George. Both plays had a lot of momentum and really hurt that we couldn't challenge"
"&gt;makes it easy for your defenders  that's my point. they, at any given time, can have multiple players on the floor who don't *need* it to b made easy for them; in a playoff game, i don't understand why u would consistently give up 35+ points to elite ball-handlers when u could just glue **literally kawhi leonard** to them at least half the time"
There‚Äôs a disgruntled star every year these days. But not often on the same tier as Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi was exhausted. The dude needed his running mate.   PG needs to step up to the plate.   PG since Indy hasn't been that guy who has demanded the ball.   Westbrook was 1A in OKC  Leonard is 1A in LAC.   He is a damn good two that any team would love to have especially since he is a great defender.   I feel like last night, he could get into the paint at will. However, with Gobert in the paint it is a difficult task.   I think he should be like Ja Morant and attack the paint relentlessly and hope to get Bojan/Ingles/ O'Neill or Gobert in foul trouble.   This being said, as a Jazz fan I hope he sticks with 3's."
"""just go out and get Kawhi Leonard"" would probably fix a lot of teams' problems"
"I mean, Giannis at least played well in Game 1 of the Semifinals. Paul George, on the other hand...  Should also be noted that Paul George has better teammates than Giannis does (I'd take Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Lou Williams in a heartbeat over Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Brook Lopez)."
Kawhi leonard with the nice -12. Maybe he needs more help?
"Yeah bro, the Jazz have figured out the secret formula to stopping Kawhi Leonard that the Sixers, Bucks, and other teams just couldn't figure out or adapt. You got it."
Best Defense: Kawhi Leonard Worst Offense: Rest of the Clippers

Personally after one game I'm counting out the team with kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard scored 3 more pts than PG on 2 more shots
Utah is by far the best defensive team in the league and they have the best defensive player possibly ever.  I don't think people understand what that means or what the full impact of that is. We're watching it right now.   Paul George and Kawhi Leonard under 25.  This is not a coincidence.
Kawhi Leonard never tries to get over screens and stay on his mind. He just automatically switches. Kennard should be our but if you want to keep him in kawhis got to fight to stay on Mitchell

"The Clippers have won 4 of their last 5 playoff games with their best playmaker being Rajon Rondo. If you throw a playmaker on that roster, with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard being on such a roll, I can‚Äôt see how the Jazz would be able to compete.   The Jazz have an electric backcourt in Ja, Mitchell, Conley, and Clarkson, but none of those players are exceptional defenders and none of them are very big either."
"Until another player has a great game, like Kawhi, then it will be ""is Kawhi Leonard actually the best player in the world"" ?  Rankings are dumb"
"&gt; A trio of Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George on the Los Angeles Clippers would be absolutely insane  While true, we don't have much in terms of assets. Portland would get Paul George in the deal. But our exact team right now with Dame instead of PG is still something to salivate over."
"The blazers are not trading Dame or CJ for anybody on the clippers roster not named Paul George or Kawhi Leonard, so the comment about them being a trio is pointless and not happening."
Google Kawhi Leonard
It‚Äôs clearly Kawhi Leonard
"&gt; I‚Äôve never seen a player so confidently put up 20+ shots a game while legitimately looking like a great value version of Kevin Knox. This man is butchering ball movement, is taking early shot clock contested iso shots, and can‚Äôt hit the broad side of the barn. Khris Middleton in this series is averaging more attempts per game than Kawhi Leonard, Devin Booker, Kyrie, and PG... while shooting over 20% less TS%. This man is getting paid a max contract.  Middleton scored 22 PPG on 64% TS in the first round. He's scored 21 PPG on 60% TS over the past two seasons.  Chill out over 2 games."
"Quite the opposite, if he truly gave no fucks he would be kawhi Leonard. KD gives the most fks"
"When the Clippers went down 0-2 against the Mavericks, they  made an adjustment for game 3 where Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were super aggressive driving to the basket every posession.  Lets see if Mike Budenholzer can make an adjustment like that."
"   Mavericks vs Clippers in 7 gms:      \- when Luka Donƒçiƒá and both Kawhi Leonard &amp; Paul George were on the floor in this series: DAL 537 points, LAC 532 points      \- when Luka Donƒçiƒá and one of Kawhi Leonard or Paul George were on the floor in this series: DAL 106 points, LAC 100 points      In non-Luka minutes in this series DAL scored 88 points, LAC scored 131"
That fella Kawhi Leonard has a knack for making comebacks after being down 0-2.
I gotta go with my boy kawhi leonard aka kiwi Lenny aka bounce bounce bounce bounce aka embiid bully aka simmons bully aka ring ring.
"I'm not writing off the Bucks yet, but it seems like you need a Kawhi Leonard to come back from 0-2."
"How much Harden and Kyrie working is because it is Harden, Kyrie and KD. I am sure Luka and Booker will work if they have someone like Kawhi Leonard as well for example."
One team had Kawhi Leonard who is a top 5 player . Giannis is not.
Mikal Bridges is who Kawhi Leonard thinks he is.
&gt; Kawhi Leonard is a better playoff performer than Kevin Durant (when not surrounded by absurd superteams). I don't have the numbers with me right now but Leonard's last 70ish playoff games over five postseasons are better than Durant's OKC postseason tenure and it's not really close.  Kawhi may not have played on absurd superteams but his supporting casts have always been absurd. There is a reason he has the highest winning % in the history of the NBA - its not because hes surrounded by scrubs. You're insane if you don't think KD would put up absurd numbers playing in the Spurs system.
kawhi leonard actually should have won the 2017 mvp as westbrook was the 7th seed and harden had the record for turnovers in a season
Cuz Luka just averaged 36/8/10 and pushed a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to 7 games while having a role player Tim Hardaway Jr as his 2nd best player

What do those two teams have in common though? Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard has entered the chat...
"Of course you‚Äôll get another franchise player for the post Dame era. The Kawhi Leonard to your Tim Duncan. Keep in mind that once the torch is passed, he will punch your head coach right in his small market nuts, and bolt for a super team in NY or LA. Don‚Äôt let it surprise you. It‚Äôs gonna hurt...  Luckily for you, it is still very much Dame time. Sharpshooters age well, so you still have a ton of time to appreciate what a heroic franchise player Dame is for your city. I doubt the league will see many more like him."

I got Kawhi Leonard over Luka for some reason
"Ahh yes the super team roster of Rodney McGruder, Joahkim Noah, JayMychal Green, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George(who was injured mostly), Lou Will, Trezz and Bev Is equivalent to having KD/Kyrie/Harden and Blake fucking griffin. Before that we had zero stars."
The one came back got an all time playoff performer in Kawhi Leonard. The bucks got known playoff underperformer in Giannis
"Tony Parker averaged the most points on the Spurs, at 18.0 ppg. Kawhi Leonard was second on the team at 17.8ppg, and did it while shooting 60% from the field and guarding lebron the entire series.   He was the best player on the Spurs in that series."
"He's had an all-time historic playoff debut, the fact it's 2 first round exists at his age is kind of irrelevant. He went against fucking Kawhi Leonard both times.  I think he's unlucky if anything and this kind of adversity early in his career could spell major trouble for western conference if they can even put a reasonable amount of help around him."
"Kawhi Leonard is a good playmaker at this pt. Gotta respect how he always found the open man or the pass before the assist this game.  Marcus Morris good job hitting the shots, RJax + Mann were on fire too"
Idk how anyone can be down on the mavs or think they need drastic change. They went 7 games against Kawhi Leonard and Paul George with a 22 year old as their best player. The future is bright.
&gt;Dame and CJ ain't dogs defensively like Lowry.  What does this have to do with anything? Lol. You said he‚Äôs small by nba standards. There are several guards his height or smaller. Lowry being a ‚Äúdog‚Äù defensively has gotten him as far as Dame has went in his career without Kawhi Leonard so stop right there
"Luka didn't make any mistakes outside of game 6 imo, but ya it doesnt make sense to say Luka can beat Kawhi at his best if his teammates show up when the times Luka won is when Kawhi's teammates didn't show up. Leonard shot 67% or better in 5 of 7 games. Unfathomably good."
"Yeah.  Iirc, [Kawhi said he'd do it](https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/03/07/kawhi-leonard-olympics-gregg-popovich/)."
"&gt; The Jazz are easily the more ""talented team""  That is highly arguable (for example, JVG called the Clippers the most talented team in the West prior to their Game 7 win), and even if the Jazz were more talented it's not ""easily.""   You're also completely ignoring the fact that the Clippers are an all around great team as well (historic 3pt shooting team, very versatile rotations, can mix it up their defensive scheme, etc. - all things the Jazz can do as well), but they have the advantage of having a Kawhi Leonard and to a lesser extent, Paul George (despite all the memes, he'll be an x-factor in the series).  Look, both teams are great but to act like the Clippers are only Kawhi is ignorant. Kawhi elevates the Clippers from a great team to a legitimate contender capable of defeating Brooklyn (not that I think it'll happen, but still). We can agree to disagree, but that's my take."
"you don't have to apologize for ""going at me"" but you are making a semantic argument that is based on just misstating what I said, no matter if you quoted it or not. I said that Luka is looking like a generational, **potential** top 15 all time **type of guy**. If you want to read that and take from that that I said ""it is likely"", or ""he is going to end up there"", that's totally fine. But that's just a reading comprehension issue.   Thinking somebody is a certain type of player, or will be, is almost completely subjective, and showing stats doesn't disprove or prove any argument, especially because the majority of your top 15 list (which I think is mostly correct) probably have worse stats than some other guys who played in their time frames. Trae could certainly end up in that same group of guys, or even end up being better than Luka. But winning one series against the Knicks isn't objectively ""better"" than losing two to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, especially considering the teams around them."
"That's too bad.  This year's USA team could've been one of best one they had:    PG Steph Curry (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Dame Lillard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Chris Paul (has shoulder injury, might skip if Suns plays deep in the playoffs)    SG James Harden (has hamstring injury, prbly want to rest it)   SG Paul George (might skip if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)    SF Kawhi Leonard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet, but might want to rest his legs if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)   SF Kevin Durant (would prbly skip to prevent overworking so soon after his achilles injury)    PF LeBron James (prbly skip to promote his movie and heal up)   PF Anthony Davis (injured)   C Bam Adebayo (would likely play)      C Myles Turner (still injured?)"
"i‚Äôm assuming the point is kawhi leonard is a bonafide superstar that‚Äôs proven he can lead a team to a chip. the jazz are a great team, but their players haven‚Äôt proven anything in the postseason that would make many people bet on them. they do have a great chance to win the series though"
They've got Kawhi Leonard
Does it matter? mavs lost the series. obviously leonard is the better defender and he was ridiculously efficient even for his standards because mavs had no one either quick enough or strong enough.   kawhi wouldn't have been able to take the clippers to seven games if he and luka swapped. That's because he and luka are two different players. luka on the clippers probably close out the series in 6.
"Luka was gassed in the 2nd half from carrying the load in the first half. Remember Game 3 first quarter????? Mavs were up by 19 then Luka goes to the bench and boom. 19 point lead gone in the matter of minutes. That‚Äôs how reliant the offense is on Luka so obviously he will get gassed. If he doesn‚Äôt go full effort at the start then it would have been a blow hour every game. Every time luka had gone to the bench, the team forgot what to do. Hell the on/off rating was +29!!! Against the knicks, Luka wouldn‚Äôt even need to put in that much effort cause there is no Kawhi Leonard on offense to compete with. If you wanna say Trae&gt;Luka u can‚Äôt use playoff wins to support that. Cause it‚Äôs a team game not individual lmao. Also, Game 5 of mavs clippers was Luka  and THJ 2v5ing  the clippers."
"Bruh they took the clippers to 7. No doubt in my mind they can take on the knicks and finish em off lmao. If Luka scored 35 ppg against Kawhi Leonard, he is for sure scoring more against Rj Barrett.  Plus Julius Randle is not about to put up Kawhi Leonard type stats lmao. Kawhi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Randle and the mavs almost beat the clippers."
Kawhi Leonard
I disagree but it‚Äôs close. Luka is putting up better stats and led his team to a game 7 against Kawhi mf Leonard. Trae is a beast as well as he put up ridiculous stats as well. But u have to look at the opponents. Saying Trae is better than Luka since he beat the knicks and Luka couldn‚Äôt beat the clippers is just straight up stupid. This mavs team would have also beat the knicks.
Bucks dont have kawhi leonard
Does anyone not a Hawks fan believe Trae Young would have been able to beat a Kawhi Leonard and Paul George team. I‚Äôll answer. Hell no!
Terance Mann really saved the Clippers franchise. He really turned into Kawhi Leonard that game.
Pop retired when Tim Duncan did outside of the brief moment before he chased Kawhi Leonard away
Kawhi Leonard doesn‚Äôt sleep. He waits.
How bought something more focused on themselves that is not so easily misconstrued as being about another team. I don't know why you can't see how Laker fans didn't like the ads  and interpreted them in a certain way. Even if the intention wasn't to bash the Lakers they were easily misconstrued as that.   For other ways they could have gone I mean you guys just got Paul George and Kawhi Leonard there was probably plenty of angles to go at most teams don't get two superstars in a single offseason.
A perfect teammate for Kawhi Leonard
Bruh 4 years $147M for Simmons? No one fucking wants that lol. That's so laughable.   You can get Kyle Lowry or Kawhi Leonard for that money lol. It's not just about the money it's about the alternative which is signing a top free agent who is actually good at basketball.  No one trying to pay $33-40M a year for the next four years for Simmons.
"""Luke Kennard on Kawhi Leonard"" is like a bizarre tongue-twister"
"&gt; Kawhi Leonard is usually not in the conversation with guys like LeBron James and Chris Paul as these veteran ""leaders"" so this is nice to see.  As a Spurs fan ... uh huh, yeah, okay."
"When did I debate Kawhi‚Äôs intentions lol? Everybody knew that no matter where he was traded he wasn‚Äôt resigning with them unless it was LA. That‚Äôs why the trade was one of the greatest in NBA history. The issue is that the Clippers as an organization acted with such a level of disrespect to the Raptors by having their owner and executives sit court side at our games, I mean you do realize the Clippers were fined $50,000 for tampering with the Raptors right? Or do you just ignore the ugly parts of your franchises history? https://www.tsn.ca/los-angeles-clippers-reportedly-fined-50k-over-doc-rivers-s-comments-on-raptors-kawhi-leonard-1.1314687?tsn-amp"
"Bro what you don‚Äôt understand is that I only root for Kawhi Leonard. I rooted for the Spurs when he was on the Spurs, I rooted for the Raptors when he was on the Raptors and now he‚Äôs on the Clippers. Believe me when I say this. Toronto fans are fucking babies. I also remember when they cheered KD getting hurt."
"Luka can't make the conference finals with Porzingis. A team with Hardaway Jr as your 2nd best player should honestly be contenders for the number 1 pick in the draft. The historic playoff numbers and keeping up with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George while have multiple triples doubles, and scoring 40 points is impressive"
I think people are taking it as I‚Äôm disrespecting the Raptors when I‚Äôm not. That was a perennial playoff team and they swapped Demar Derozan for Kawhi Leonard (Ik they also added Gasol and he was instrumental but he played like shit in the finals) Nurse is a fantastic coach too. Kawhi‚Äôs numbers during that entire run were just fucking astounding. He shot like 65% from the floor or something fucking ridiculous for the entire playoffs.
"Kawhi ""not on the web"" Leonard probably got the landline going 24/7"
I‚Äôd take worse free throw shooting if that means Kawhi Leonard doesn‚Äôt shoot the ball 66 percent or higher 5 out of 7 games in the series
&gt; Ty Lue joked that Kawhi Leonard tried facetiming him 40 minutes ago but Ty doesn't like FaceTime.  üß¢  Kawhi obviously uses Android.
&gt;Ty Lue joked that Kawhi Leonard tried facetiming him 40 minutes ago but Ty doesn't like FaceTime.  Just another example of a stubborn hard-headed coach refusing to adjust his scheme according to his players!
"Mitchell playing great is not evidence that he wasn't injured. He was clearly badly hobbled at the ends of games 4, 5, and 6. Did you watch any of those games?  &gt;even when they had Conley, they lost twice in a row  Conley played 1 game, not 2. Again: did you watch any Jazz-Clippers games?  The Suns are at full strength and only pulled away from that ""Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard"" at home at the very end of the game. Are we going to start claiming the Suns need to blow it up, too, because they're not winning in sufficiently dominant fashion against the Clippers right now?"
"Let‚Äôs not act like Mitchell was really that badly injured. He was playing great. And even when they had Conley, they lost twice in a row to a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard..."
That‚Äôs blantantly false. If I could make my flair just ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard‚Äù I would. I don‚Äôt root for teams I root for him. When he was on Spurs I rooted for him. When he was on the Raptors I rooted for him. And now he‚Äôs on the Clippers. Basically I‚Äôve followed him his entire career. Yes. The Raptors players raved about his leadership. They said they felt like they could win any game with him and how he would calm and steady them through clutch moments. Lowry was A leader. But he was not THE leader.
"Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, made Derozan highly efficient as playmaker, plucked Neal, Forbes, Bertans from undrafted or late 2nd round, Tony Parker developed a semi-reliable 3pt shot, Manu was Manu, made Bowen into a reliable corner 3 shooter (but didnt fix FTs), worked with TD to improve FT form to mixed results.   They are known to not just concentrate on shooting but rather optimize the game from ground up. Thats why we are just starting to see Dejounte Murray improve the three as he needed handling, passing and rehab first. Hes improved his midrange extensively. Other players have improved shooting form (Murray, White, KJ (wip), Walker (more consistent), Luka (was doing great at Austin), Vassel saw slight improvement before falling back.   So there is progress from a lot of players but not all can be attributed to the coaching staff, great majority is player dependent on their effort and hard work, Spurs just provide good coaching to achieve the results.   Simmons seems to be a prime player for Pop and staff to figure out his best role and attack his weaknesses to put him in the best situation to succeed. We reclaimed Boris Diaw and at times he was the best player on both ends for Spurs. Simmons would be a beast in SA, dont care what everyone says about him."
No he couldn't. He averaged 20% and 29% from the college 3 in his two years at San Diego State. He was a rebounder who ate the boards and made his points primarily in transition. Shooter...lol.  https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kawhi-leonard-1.html
I think Kawhi with a decent team would have beaten both those teams. The Raptors outside of Leonard were awful against the sixers and it was Leonard who held that series till Raptors found themselves next round.   Leonard might not be the guy to drive your team all the way through because of his injuries and fatigue but he will absolutely get you a series.
"Not to say I told you so or anything, but...  Been preaching for a few years now. At least as far back as when Kawhi was available: Simmons is what he is. To be fair, I didn't know he'd not only fail to progress, but actually lessen as an impact, but you just can't win with a PG that can't shoot in today's NBA. And it's went from ""he's not good from distance or the FT line"" to ""he's afraid to shoot a wide-open layup."" Would Kawhi have been a one-year rental for Philly? Most likely. Tell me who the best player was on the team that won the Finals in the year Leonard played in the East. Would Philly have had to then revamp their roster for that one title? Yeah. Compared to...them having to revamp their roster after zero titles?   And to further the need to trade Simmons, I used Embiid's injury history. Very unique situation where his ""title or bust"" window is very short. Oft-injured bigs don't get healthier as they age.   And while this has been about Simmons in particular, it's part of the bigger picture of reality as well: The mindset of so many franchises that Player A is younger than Player B - even if Player B is far more talented - so Player A can't be traded is just so stupid."
"Oh come on. GMs definitely put weight into the Doc and Embiid quotes, not because they think it devalues Ben but because they know it‚Äôs forcing Phillys hand even more in trade talks so they can give less to get Simmons.  This sub is fucking idiotic sometimes. Isaiah Thomas for Kyrie Irving? Kawhi Leonard for DeRozan? James Harden for 1st round picks? Those all happened because a team had to make a trade and the teams they were trading with knew they could hold out."
"Kawhi Leonard shot 6 for 22 and Paul George shot 4-16 in Game 7. If the Hawks had lost their last game would it have been Nate McMillan's fault that Trae went 5-23?   Doc made plenty of mistakes, but putting it all on him is definitely scapegoating."
I love Lowry but he didn't have the playoff experience like Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi guided them through. He knew what it takes and what they had to do. He was there before.  Especially when going down 0-2 to the bucks
"I would love to work at a place where I get injured and when I try to get a second opinion my coworkers come out of the blue to throw me under the bus in public.      Lost Dennis Rodman, lost Kawhi Leonard, hmm..."
"As a big of fan of Duncan, that was so painful. Somehow at age 39, he was the only Spur besides Patty Mills to play as good in 2015 as he had in 2014 vs OKC &amp; Miami. Put up 19-11 on 60% shooting for the series against the far younger and more spry Griffin and Jordan and even preserved a win by blocking a Blake Griffin dunk. Then in game 7 on the road he twice ties the game with clutch buckets only to lose to a one-legged Chris Paul after he came about an inch short of getting his finger on the ball.  After that series I can kind of forgive the Clippers falling apart against Houston - those teams shouldn't have met in the first round and whoever was coming out of it was gonna be half-dead for the following series.  (On a side note, it's great to see CP3 *finally* getting his due for being a great playoff performer. Somehow carrying his team to a game-7 win against the defending champs, playing on a *clearly* injured leg while being guarded by Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green with Tim Duncan playing help defense, got quickly forgotten and everyone still talks about his regular season prowess but how he can't bring it in the playoffs in the same way ... smh)."
"Not exactly but something similar like [This one](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2784034-kawhi-leonard-trade-rumors-spurs-asked-76ers-for-3-1st-round-picks-2-players)  ""ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported LeBron James' representatives were with Sixers officials Sunday, and the New York Times' Marc Stein reported the team hoped to use a Leonard trade to entice James.""  Rumor is just rumor, of course"
Losing in the 2nd round to a team without Kawhi Leonard in back to back crucial games*
"&gt;First off I did not say he is a feel good story.   This entire thread is about players who ""redeemed"" themselves, a group in which Carmelo is being erroneously included.   &gt;Your original point is that melo is the biggest problem with the team. This is complete wrong.  You're bending over backwards to find ways to argue that the worst player to get minutes, who does terribly in those minutes night in and night out, isn't the biggest reason the team loses.  Any no-name player who wasn't a 10x all-star or however many it was shows up and gives the low-effort, lazy, inefficient performances Carmelo does and they'd be universally reviled on this sub. But since guys grew up watching him and he used to be good the excuses never end for him.   &gt;You haven‚Äôt even mentioned any other points of mine of how the other players did horrible as well.  The only player to be nearly as bad as Carmelo in the playoffs was Kanter, but unlike Carmelo Kanter was actually productive in the regular seeason and a large part of the reason we were still in the playoff hunt with CJ and Nurkic out for half the year.  &gt;You cant use him as a scape goat for all the other issues.  The team having other things it needs to improve doesn't change the fact that he's the worst player to get minutes on the team and fucks up both our offense and our defense whenever he's on the court.   The #1 change the team needs to make going into next year is improving the bench (yes, even more than trading CJ or whatever other stuff people yell about). We had the worst second unit of any team in the playoffs (well, Western playoffs at least).   The #1 way to improve the bench is by replacing Carmelo with any other marginally productive forward who actually gives a modicum of effort on defense and doesn't jack up terrible shots whenever they get the ball.   Ergo, he's the biggest problem with the team and needs to go. If he's on the team next year taking double digit FGA again, we're a first-round bounce again (if we even make the playoffs), full stop.  &gt;Coaching problems with his mins  Yes, the problem with his minutes is that he has any.  No coach or system could make 2021 Carmelo productive. He's terrible.  &gt; roster construction,  ""Roster construction"" is not a singular problem. If you're going to bring up abstract concepts instead of something tangible, there's no point.  &gt;and CJ being a role player not a star.   Nonsensical complaint. You might as well say ""the biggest problem with the team is that Dame isn't the best player of all time"" or ""the biggest problem with the team is that Derrick Jones Jr. isn't Kawhi Leonard."" CJ is who he is -- a good player who contributes to the team winning basketball games more often than not, despite an underwhelming (not even ""horrible"" like you keep saying) playoff series this year. Sure, it'd be nice if he was a better player, but he isn't the main problem with the team. The guy playing losing basketball every time he touches the court is."

"Just wait til I tell you the Jazz got the #1 seed, best record in the league, only to blow a 25 point lead on the Clippers without Kawhi Leonard."
2009: Steph Curry  2010: Paul George  2011: Kawhi Leonard  2012: NA (no pick apparently so I'll do 13 and 14)  2013: Giannis  2014: Technically we didn't draft Wiggins but we could've gotten Embiid with 1 and Jokic with 13
"Clippers didn‚Äôt have top 5 player Kawhi Leonard and their other All-Star Paul George is playing through a toe injury and Ibaka, their best 5, was out the whole series."
"No I don‚Äôt agree. It is kawhi fucking Leonard but Conley was their floor general and a sniper from 3. It‚Äôs so hard to throw a backup in that role. Terrance Mann took the kawhi role, no one could really take Conleys role for the jazz. It‚Äôs not just as simple as kawhi is better"
"Swear to god this new trend of ""LuKa cAn't eleVate his tEammatess!!!"" is one of the dumbest takes of all time. These people really think that these Mavs role players could have taken the healthy Clips WITH KAWHI FUCKING LEONARD to 7 games without Doncic's presence elevating them?????"
Kawhi Leonard
"Ok I know we all love the PX bandwagon, myself included, but now we‚Äôre being outright silly. You folks are really saying CP3 is more valuable than Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis. Mind blown."
I‚Äôm not saying Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid is Kawhi Leonard and Paul George but yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
"Kawhi Leonard might edge out Donovan, or AD if it's positionless. Jamal Murray and Jerami Grant are solid 2nd team options as well."
SIMMONS GETTIN PAID LIKE KAWHI LEONARD TO PUT 7 POINTS
"Lol Galo looking like Kawhi freaking Leonard, that was a textbook Kawhi like steal."
"This series is on Simmons, you re gettin paid like Kawhi Fucking Leonard you better play like him when it matters"
"We need to freeze time besides Kawhi Leonard for a while, and then not play the series for 2 weeks and boom good to go"
"It‚Äôs almost like the game is so offensively leaning that perimeter defenders and shotmakers have more value than an archaic paint bound defender who is ELITE in the paint but has no ability to blitz or switch or hedge.   The ELITE players cook everyone at the point of attack. Kawhi Leonard, one of the best defenders ever, can‚Äôt lock down drives every single time down. He was roasted by Luka and Donovan. The argument is nonsensical because the players that COULD stay in front and defend elected offensive players simply don‚Äôt exist or rarely exist. THAT‚ÄôS why teams switch.  It‚Äôs an existential question of resource allotment. That‚Äôs why Gobert is polarizing."
"Devin Booker shone brightly for the Suns today. If he can keep on having games like this vs. the Clippers look out! And, if Chris Paul comes back things could get even more  troublesome for the Clippers without Kawhi Leonard."
"that all sounds good but you can't forget about adding a foreign veteran presence at center who can injure kawhi leonard, I think zaza pachulia would be perfect here"
"i don't think conley is an excuse to lose to a clippers team missing kawhi fucking leonard, don't you agree? getting torched by a second round 48th pick player for 39 points is unacceptable"
"Giannis ""Kawhi ""Clipper God"" ""Leonard"" Antetokounpo."
You‚Äôre really telling me a top 5 pg of all time who was still an mvp candidate this year is not close to kawhi Leonard. I mean feel free to disagree but it‚Äôs just objectively wrong
This is where LA needed kawhi Leonard
People in Phoenix definitely support your idea of a Kawhi Leonard for Chris Paul trade. See no issues on that front.
Aaaand here is where you want Kawhi Leonard.
But also this is Kawhi Leonard. Not talking shit but the guy will choose his long-term health a lot of the time.
"Good Q. I'm a Celtics fan, but I really like Kawhi Leonard because he is a superstar who is an amazing two way player. He can defend anyone position which is just awesome to watch"
Without Zaza putting a hit on Kawhi Leonard they never would have made the finals‚Ä¶
How quickly we forget he was the only other player willing to take shots in the 4 quarter versus the raptors. Kawhi Leonard shot over Ben Simmons for the game winner. Your guy's a dud
That flamingo? Kawhi leonard
"While the game was incredible, as a neutral fan I kind of feel sorry overall for the East. This is the first Bucks game I've watched all season. I've heard the complaints about their lack of a refined offense and coaching problems... and jesus christ they were not understated. Long stretches of the game felt like just hero ball from Middleton or Giannis charging the hoop and drawing a foul, then awkwardly shooting FTs.   I can't see this Bucks team winning the finals against Phoenix or LA. Our alternatives are a hobbled Sixers team with all-star guard who can't even reach Shaq's FT%, or an exciting Hawks team that's inexperienced. The other side has Chris Paul or Kawhi Leonard."
[This article could answer your question better than I could](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/clippers-to-implement-triangle-offense-sets-and-use-kawhi-leonard-like-michael-jordan-and-kobe-bryant)
"https://www.sportscasting.com/why-did-kawhi-leonard-hide-from-spurs-staff-members-who-were-looking-for-him-before-requesting-a-trade/?amp  Here's one, there are several others out there, but it would take me too long to find them all. Most of what I said comes from me following the story closely during the season it was happening in, which makes it harder to find because it happened 2-3 years ago."
"Yeah I think you misunderstood everything I just said lol. I never called him a name: I said I don‚Äôt believe Woj *because* Woj was making him out to be a bitch.   As far as you claiming the Spurs misdiagnosed him: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773680-kawhi-leonard-rumors-spurs-stars-camp-disagree-on-injury-diagnosis  The Spurs diagnosed tendinopathy. He played like 9 games that season. The Spurs have always been known to rest players, and bench them rather than have them play through an injury."
Conley and Mitchell(who could still play) combined don‚Äôt equal a Kawhi Leonard so yeah it is minimal compared to most
"If the Suns are without Chris Paul, I don‚Äôt see how they beat the Clippers. Even without Kawhi. Honestly I don‚Äôt think the Suns will win even with Chris Paul. I mean the Clippers just beat the #1 team in the league. Without Kawhi Leonard. I don‚Äôt know if people realize how impressive that is. The Jazz threw some fucking haymakers in those last 2 games and the Clippers withstood it all. I think people are just focusing more on what the Jazz didn‚Äôt do than what the Clippers actually did do, so they‚Äôre writing off the Clippers and thinking ‚ÄúNo way Phoenix let‚Äôs that happen‚Äù."
"Bruh they blew a 25 point lead in an elimination game when the other team was missing **Kawhi leonard.**  No this isn't the way of reddit. That **was** a complete embarrassment.  You can't be the top seed, go 2 up on a team, then lose 4 straight. The last 2 of which that team was missing Kawhi, a top 3 player in the world. This collapse is worse than the Bucks."
"You guys have Leonard and PG, off course he doesnt play much. You can bet he wouldnt be going for 39 if Kawhi was playing."
"What a bitch, you‚Äôre not going to be there for your team??? And I really like kawhi Leonard, but that‚Äôs not cool"
Kawhi Leonard probably.
"It‚Äôs not about that.. the slander got to the point where you‚Äôd think he was a legit scrub. The dude is a 6x All NBA guy and multiple time all star.. he‚Äôs one of the best small forwards of the decade behind Bron, KD, and Kawhi and he‚Äôs even had more longevity than Leonard even after snapping his leg in half..  The man doesn‚Äôt get enough credit for coming back the way he did"
"As someone who has followed the clippers religiously throughout the playoffs, here are my reasons why they will win it all. (Obviously Objective but what I‚Äôve seen over the growth of 13 games this post season)  1. Paul George stepped up as the leader due to the Kawhi injury but also knows when to play reserved.  2. Reggie ‚ÄúMr. June‚Äù Jackson knows when it‚Äôs time to step up, always plays with so much confidence in his game.  3. Ty Lue proved himself twice by being 2-0 in two consecutive series.  4. Terrance Mann is the San Antonio Spurs Kawhi Leonard, I see way too much potential in him. What other second year has the balls to yam it on a 3-year DPOY. 5. Watching Pat Beverley get minutes and play good makes me so happy since people have obviously forgotten about the annoyance of his defense.   Everyone is due to their opinions however these are some of the reasons why I remain confident when talking about the Clippers."
Kawhi Leonard is out lol. That basically guaranteed the Suns a Finals berth.
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
I'm sorry but Terrence Mann played way better than Kawhi Leonard ever could. Give the Mann credit.
Kawhi might not have an extensive bag but his handle is very sharp and he reacts quickly. He uses his strength a lot but I wouldn‚Äôt make the Pierce comparison as Leonard isn‚Äôt really herky jerky
"If you replaced a max player with a supermax player, yes, that team would get better.  I also think replacing Tobias Harris with Paul George or Kawhi Leonard would make the Sixers better.  Brave, I know."
Kawhi Leonard Ewing theory lol
"Yes, you've got something here. Paul George has been volatile for the Clippers, while being valuable even a bad night.  Bad nights look like: heavy turnovers and missed shots, while playing important defense, and playmaking, and gravity. And even while going 1-7 for field goals he goes 8-8 from the stripe... the true answer to the ""save the universe with a free throw"" question is Paul George because this is the guy who can suck but still shoot a free throw.  And the most effective cure is the worst cure: remove Kawhi Leonard. Paul George then gets more touches, and thus more points. And more touches gives him more chances to shake off his demons in a bad game. When Kawhi was out for a stretch this season, Paul George was the player of the month and was good for 30 points every time.  However. I think PG knows what everyone knows: you need at *least* a 2-star system to win a championship nowadays. He also knows he's not quite Kawhi, and that Kawhi has some coattails you can ride pretty far on. And what does he and Ty Lue do with that knowledge? An elite version of the ""glue guy"".  I like it. Hope they stick with it, run it back, make some impressive changes but not blow anything up."
"He's a great coach. Gotta him credit for making the right adjustments and allowing his team to stay within the moment, even as adversity hits.  While its great to have players like Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love on your roster, he was able to put it all together to make it all work out. At least so far in these playoffs."
&gt; All without Kawhi Leonard  I entered this thread thinking about how a healthy Donovan Mitchell would have swung this but completely forgot Kawhi is out! Great performance by the Clippers.
That was Kawhi Leonard playing through Terrence Mann lmao
Pray we get Chris Paul and Kawhi Leonard back this series. I want it to go to 7
Kawhi Gon Leonard using the force on the Clippers.
&gt; Kawhi Leonard being undefeated when down 2-0 remains intact  Are we not counting when the he got Zaza'd and they got swept?
Kawhi ‚ÄúDrew Bledsoe‚Äù Leonard
So the Clippers followed up a 7 game series win with a 6 game series win in which they lost the first two? And they have Kawhi Leonard on their team? Where have I seen that before...
Ridiculous.  The Clippers *lost Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka for the year* and ***TERRANCE MANN*** is the one who shows up to boot the 1 seed from the West.  What the fuck.
"Obviously I'm biased, but why are the top comments all about how Utah lost?  The Clippers lost Kawhi Leonard and gutted out two fantastic wins with incredible performances from a second rounder and two vets on minimum contracts.  Shouldn't that be the lead??"
While the clips are missing kawhi fucking Leonard and their starting center
What‚Äôs up here were the Jazz just really good during the regular season? Did they fizzle out in the playoffs? I thought they had the pieces to beat the Clippers especially after Kawhi Leonard was hurt. I‚Äôm kinda confused here.
"Injured forward Kawhi Leonard yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Terance Mann gave a look of pleasant surprise. Reggie Jackson yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Paul George hit the locker room door, former NBA great Ty Lue hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Not just 2-0 series lead. Lost 4 straight and Kawhi Leonard was out for two of them and they let Terance Mann almost score 40 on them.
"Yeah, but he had Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, and *checks clipboard* Terrence Mann for those series."
You kinda forgot to mention a huge part (that makes it about 10x worse): that Kawhi fucking Leonard was injured for the final two games.
"No Serge Ibaka and no Kawhi Leonard, down by 25, and then here come Paul George, Terance Mann, Pat Bev, Nicolas Kaboom, and Reggie the Big Government Jackson. After 51 playoffs that made Clip fans depressed, they deserve every bit of this conference finals appearance. And so does Mann and PLAYOFF P."
"Bobby Shmurda, Terrance ""Kawhi Leonard"" Mann and Post-Pandemic P all showed up tonight, but damn what a choke from the Utah Jazz."
"1st conference finals in franchise history, came back to win 4 straight after being down 0-2, won the last two games without even having their best player Kawhi Leonard, and were down 25 points tonight just to come back and win. They have a right to celebrate.   But yeah, hope you're right about them getting clapped by the Suns lmao I don't want a tense stress inducing back and fourth series."
The ghost of Kawhi Leonard seems to have possessed Terrance Mann today
"Terance ""Not Kawhi Leonard because he's not a robot, he's the"" Mann"
"Terance ""Grown"" Mann drops a career high 39  Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson drops 27 and 10 assists   Paul George comes up huge in the 4th   And Pat Bev closing with two clutch 3's late and great defense on Spida all series  After being down 25 in the 2nd half  All without Kawhi Leonard. Somebody pinch me because this doesn't feel real. Ty Lue take a fucking bow.   We in uncharted territory now"
"Yeah, but if you think about it an injured Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka had the Jazz exactly where they wanted em. And then injuries struck, I have no doubt in my mind that if the Clippers were fully healthy, [we] would be in our way to the NBA Finals"
Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors.
"Be real, man. Playing with LeBron and AD is a better situation than playing with PG and...I don't know. Reggie Jackson won't be there next year. Zubac can't even play every series. Clippers have a lot of aging role players. That's not the issue. However, like you said, cap space is the issue.   To get Kawhi, the Lakers would have to have Leonard agree to a sign-and-trade and give up AD. On the surface, sure. But, does it really makes the Lakers better? LeBron can still be great, but he's at the point in his career where he needs a #2 that can stay healthy, can get his own basket and who has proven he can perform in the playoffs. AD only checks two of those boxes. But, if we're being honest, so does Kawhi."

"Game 2 and game 4 was their best chance to get this series and they failed both times. Those type of games decide who wins a series or not.  Very difficult to comeback especially since they are beyond gassed at this point because of nr. of games and scheduling.  Suns will go back to Phoenix and play an average game centered around more PnR action with C.Paul and will win. 4-1.  Clippers fought well but in the crucial games it was very clear why you need Kawhi Leonard to finish off games, or in game 4 to get you some vital buckets in the 4th."
Suns in 6 versus bucks. Finals MVP: Chris Paul ‚Äî-Lakers in 5 versus bucks. Finals MVP: Lebron James  Bucks in 7 versus Lakers Finals MVP: Giannis  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Spurs in 7 over Pistons Finals MVP: Kawhi Leonard Mavs in 7 over Pistons Finals MVP: Luka Doncic
"That whole ""every run has some luck"" thing starts to run thin when literally every team they face is injured. Especially when it's the top players injured. Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Will Barton, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris. Probably missing more, but that's all I can remember"
"Kawhi is extremely reserved. My wife was his bartender in La Jolla, CA and he didn't say a word. She sent me a text saying ""Do you know who Kawhi Leonard is? I'm waiting on him."" This was right after the championship. It took every ounce of strength in my body to not drive up there and casually introduce myself."
And although he was finals MVP with the Spurs- he wasn‚Äôt the reason they won that Finals. It was an ensemble. He hadn‚Äôt become ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard‚Äù yet.
"I think commentary is a whole layer to the game that is often underappreciated. Inside jokes for local broadcasts, signature phrases, knowledge of the game, heck I have searched for Ian Eagle highlights so many times but only a few compilations exist. I guess good commentary is commentary that just becomes part of the broadcast and only bad commentary is noticed when people mess up like Marv. When done well it helps with the flow of the game and gives good audio cues as to when something interesting is happening.   I also hate the title, it gives the connotation that Breen made a mistake. A much better title would be:   After an electrifying basket the camera pans to an emotionless Kawhi and Mike Breen exclaims: ""Kawhi Leonard going crazy!"""
"You‚Äôre shocked that Kawhi Leonard, a guy who already gave up on one team, is giving up on this one too?"
What if Tim Duncan went to Orlando?  What if Kawhi Leonard never got hurt while with the Spurs?
"Landing in a player‚Äôs landing space isn‚Äôt a basketball play dude he literally took an extra step towards Kawhi and Leonard landed on his foot, [either Zaza is slow or that was 100% intentional. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/gfycat.com/amp/faithfulchillyhornshark-kawhi-leonard-injured-by-dirty-play-from-zaza-pachulia-gif)"
‚ÄúNew footage revealed that Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs injury was caused by Paul George tying Leonard down on a bed and hitting legs with a sledgehammer.‚Äù
Kawhi ‚ÄúFDR‚Äù Leonard
"CP3 was bricking in the clutch what are you talking about. He‚Äôs also a hall of famer?? Reggie is a good starter. They aren‚Äôt paying him max money?? They need Kawhi leonard lol, they can‚Äôt afford Lowry unless he takes a pay cut"
reggie jackson‚Äôs been great this playoffs but giving up reggie jackson shots for kawhi leonard shots still seems like a great exchange for the clippers. plus reggie was doing this with kawhi playing
"They said this during the last game as well. Something along the lines of ""an excited kawhi leonard"" and it panned to him poker facing lol"
2019 NBA champions: Toronto Raptors* Asterisk reason: Kevin Durant ruptured his Achilles tendon in Game 5 and Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6. Kawhi Leonard rested all season and a timely gust of wind at the end of Game 7 against Philadelphia 76ers nudged the ball just enough to fall in the basket. Unfair.
Mike Breen sure can‚Ä¶‚ÄùKawhi Leonard going crazy‚Äù
"To be fair, that IS Kawhi Leonard going crazy."
"""Kawhi Leonard going crazy""  Kawhi: üòê"
Lebron-Anthony Davis  Jamal Murray  Kawhi Leonard-Serge Ibaka  There‚Äôs the example. It‚Äôs not his fault obviously but it‚Äôs a pretty factual statement that CP3 has benefitted from injuries this year.
"Crazy to think that they‚Äôve outscored the Suns by 3 after 4 games. The 3 games they‚Äôve lost came down to not being able to close in the fourth quarter. The biggest part of that is missing Kawhi fucking Leonard, their best player, their closer, and a top 3-4 playoff performer in the league. Unbelievable honestly."
Well ya when you don‚Äôt follow basketball or really understand the sport it‚Äôs obviously just Chris Paul carrying the team.   At least we hedged our bets on a injury prone player that managed to not aggravate the same injury again.   How‚Äôs kawhi ‚Äúmanages the loads‚Äù Leonard working out for you?   ü§°ü§°ü§°
if kawhi leonard was healthy he would take over this game
Where were you when Reggie Jackson carried Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to the finals

So what‚Äôs the matter with kawhi Leonard? I keep hearing different things.
if wade got hurt in 2012 or kawhi leonard in 2014 he might've won a ring for okc. just shows there is a pretty large luck component. not knocking giannis or the bucks but just saying.
"People fall into this trap of looking at stats or tape of young Leonard that's similar to current young guys and wonder if they're ""the next Kawhi."" Leonard's truly an anomaly and one of the greatest developmental stories ever, he pretty much had no jumper coming into the league, his calling cards were his physical tools, work ethic, defense and rebounding. He obviously came into a great situation with multiple hall of fame teammates and coach but to his credit he worked his ass off to turn himself into one of the greatest playoff scorers ever."
Lol yea man it's cheaper and faster than most internet in the US. Most of y'all got shit speeds for shit prices.   I like the lakers mavs and kawhi Leonard man is there a flair for that?  I just making sure to come back to the hawks fans who got hyped after beating the Knicks and then injured Philly.
"It was to rehab.  I think the NBA actually changed a rule about [resting players having to sit on the bench](https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1335994619364954115?s=21) last year because of kawhi leonard. He'd load manage but be no where in sight. He'd be in the back.   He's rehabbing so he's not flying. I don't think he's coming back, but I hold out for hope, but I think it's a month worth of recovery. I don't know what kinda sprain it is. Clippers medical staff is very secretive. If could be an ACL sprain or an MCL sprain, or LCL, I don't really know. He might have a strain that's quick to recover from or one that's longer.   The acl was what they feared but it hasn't been reported as an ACL sprain, just as a knee sprain"
"Luka was guarded by paul george, kawhi leonard, pat bev, batum, and morris sr. Are you actually that deluded to say the clips have worse defense than seth fucking curry"
"Morris should play, but less minutes.  I think the Clippers have figured out how they want to play without Kawhi Leonard."
"Unjustifiably harsh. For the record, Medvedenko has any many championships as both Kevin Durant &amp; Kawhi Leonard"
"sign the new balance executives to lure kawhi leonard, brilliant"
"its not a 6 player draft when 5 players have respective upsides of magic johnson, kobe bryant, hakeem olajuwon, gary payton, and kawhi leonard, and the 6th player has the upside of draymond green"
2nd round knockout from either the Lakers or a Kawhi Leonard team.
"Lmao oh no you lost cam Payne? Wow that‚Äôs so impactful compared to fucking Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray and Anthony Davis, all of whom have better playoff track records than Booker lol"
I only watch clips when Clippers win because he has an obvious dislike for Kawhi Leonard
And they had this one guy called Kawhi Leonard

"Probably harden. Most ppl seem to hate his playstyle from years ago and because of that, didn‚Äôt really watch his later progressions in Houston where he a) got significantly better at defense (still not above average but serviceable at least) and b) stopped blantantly foul baiting as much (don‚Äôt get me wrong, the flops still happened here and there but not nearly as often as ppl would have you believe).   Then he also gets trashed for not being successful in the postseason even though cumulatively for the last near decade, he‚Äôs been better/more successful than every player besides a) warriors players b) Lebron james or c) Kawhi Leonard."
"KD being on twitter makes me not believe other athletes are not on social media reading up on themselves. They claim they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt read that stuff‚Äù, but I‚Äôm convinced everybody does and that majority of athletes actually have burner accounts (yes I‚Äôm even referring to Kawhi Leonard)"
"Scottie at his best was a 21/8/5 guy, and he was the best perimeter defender. Adjust those stats to present-day pace and scoring, and it's likely a 24/7/7 guy. I'd say like a version of Jimmy Butler that was better on defense, or a Kawhi Leonard type that wasn't as great of a shot creator.   Scottie was a lot better than what this sub gives him credit for"
Good defenders also with Kawhi Leonard

"here's what I will say for Jordan as someone who was alive (albeit a kid, born in 85) when he played.  MJ was a singular force and was by far the best &amp; most popular athlete of that era.  Contrary to what many believe, he did not play against milkmen, there were tons of legends in the 80s &amp; 90s that are all-time players that Jordan went against, and he subjugated them all.  MJ was head &amp; shoulders above the rest of his peers in a way that LeBron hasn't been in his career.  It's up for debate when LeBron passed Kobe, a lot of people say 2012, and for 3 seasons LeBron was the undisputed best player in the world until Curry &amp; KD came along (and then Harden, and Kawhi, and Giannis, and now Luka).  Once MJ passed Bird &amp; Magic there was nobody else even remotely in his stratosphere for an entire decade.  By the 90s, MJ was so far ahead of everyone else and so dominant that he was inevitable in a way that LeBron hasn't been.     As a kid, you KNEW the Bulls were going to win, it was a question of when, not if.  Jordan redefined the sport and is still influencing &amp; impacting the game today.  When you see Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum &amp; others, they're all doing a Kobe impression, and Kobe was doing a Jordan impression.  Jordan was the best offensive player AND the best defensive player in the NBA at his peak, and his statistics are absolutely bananas in a vacuum and doubly so when considering the era he played in.  Regardless of whether you consider stats, career achievements, influence on the game or really anything else, MJ is it.  I recommend that anyone who is able to finds a copy of *Playing For Keeps* by David Halberstam to get the most complete Jordan experience, cannot recommend that book highly enough."
With Chris Paul and without Kawhi Leonard.
"The difference between Giannis' energy and Kawhi's energy was literally yin and yang.  Giannis, on his feet, calling plays and motivating his teammates. First one on the floor during timeouts giving everyone love.  Kawhi, sitting in stands disinterested. Enough said.  I feel bad for Paul George because at least he showed up. That last post game interview where I believe he said, ""real leaders show up"" (paraphrasing) was clearly directed towards Leonard.  Good luck Clips, ya gonna need it in the office season."

"Like I said he makes good enough points, it's just hard having to listen to all the fluff before he gets to the point. Maybe he's changed in the last couple of years but whenever I'd listen to him on Grantland back in the day it felt like he was trying to fill out the word count for a school paper or something.  Jalen: ""The Spurs will be contenders.""  ""Tim Duncan, 15x All-Star, 2x league MVP. 5 rings in 18 years. Never missed the Playoffs or won less than 50 games. One of the NBA's nice guys. Doesn't say much, but he's a competitor. You gotta be to win 5 rings... and play for the same team.""  ""Tony Parker. 4x league champion. One of the best Point Guards of the past 15 years. Driving to the lane, hitting the floater. He can do it all man.""  ""Kawhi Leonard. DPOY. San Diego State alumni. He has a Finals MVP in his trophy case too. The youngest EVER after Magic Johnson, the greatest PG ever who has 5 rings and 9 Finals appearances, with some of the best showdowns ever with the Celtics, always willing to take a picture. Kawhi can do it all man!""  It gets boring after a while lol"
‚Äú‚ÄùI want the Larry OB‚Äù - Kawhi Leonard‚Äù- PJ Tucken
"Almost every star this playoff got injured though, especially on the teams they faced.  You saying almost every team built a team of injury prone players?  Anthony Davis,  Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Jaylen Brown  I mean even Chris Paul got hurt, and Booker broke his nose.  Those are just the guys who would be considered stars."
"Damn, Bucks really did it. Been a few years coming, and it's great to see them get into the finals, even if it's without Giannis.  Obviously disappointing to get 2-0'd by the Bucks without Giannis, but still an unbelievably exciting time for the Hawks. Cam Reddish popped the fuck off tonight, and Reddish+Hunter developing next year is frightening when you see what the Hawks already did this year. Not to mention further development of Okongwu/Huerter.  While players like Bogey/Galo are some of the most skilled offensive players in the world, the defensive athleticism of Hunter/Reddish/Okongwu is scary, combined with Capela as the anchor and Collins who is solid too. The Hawks are going to have so many options, assuming Hunter can stay healthy (he looked amazing before going out again) and Reddish further develops.  I don't believe in ""unofficial asterisks"" when it comes to championships. Unless there's an actual, official reason that changed the way a championship is earned, I think that shit is stupid to even talk about. Last year the bubble, this year injuries, it's still 16 teams playing bo7's after regular seasons longer than the strike season.  With that out of the way, I just want to highlight how insane the blood-soaked path is for the Suns. First round, they play the Lakers and AD gets (re)injured, Lebron not 100%. Second round, Nuggets with no Jamal Murray or Dozier, Barton still working his way back. Conference finals, Clippers without Kawhi or Ibaka, and Zubac out the last two games.  That's not like a few random injuries to decent players. That's AD/Lebron, Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, and Giannis. MVP's and finals MVP's out the ass. Pretty insane.  I'm really happy that my two favorite teams to watch this year (pls come back Sonics) are into the finals. Just hoping Giannis is able to come back at some point, even if it's 3-0 and doomed. Suns have easily been my favorite this year, but I've been rooting hard for the Bucks these last couple years, so I guess I won't know who I want to win until they start playing."
"Yes, who could have predicted the likes of Anthony Day-to-Davis, Kawhi ‚Äúdegenerative knee condition‚Äù Leonard and Kyrie ‚Äúskips the playoffs literally every other year‚Äù Irving missing time.  Shit happens, that‚Äôs not their problem."
"His injury history is pretty wildly exaggerated at this point, he plays way more than Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving did over the last five season and you never see these kinds of comments about them."
They would have signed Kawhi Leonard in free agency in the summer of 2019. What happens after that is anyone's guess.
"Lebron washed friend. Hopefully you guys get Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, and reincarnated prime Michael Jordan to make a run next year."
Yes Kawhi Leonard the guy who left a supermax on the table in San Antonio and left a championship team in Toronto JUST to be in Los Angeles will now want to leave his family in LA to go to Dallas
"Has he really faced adversity? Like yeah he was briefly hurt and got covid so I guess that's personal adversity, but the sun's have really played 0 remotely healthy teams. The healthiest team they've faced is the clippers without kawhi Leonard and banged up Marcus Morris. And how the fuck did he even manage to get covid during the playoffs with vaccines? A chip is a chip but idk if I'd call the sun's road adversity."
I don‚Äôt really care about the Luka/Trae debate but bro...Clippers vs Knicks. I wish we could‚Äôve played Julius Randle averaging 18 points on 35% eFG instead of Kawhi Leonard averaging 32 on 67% eFG lmao
"Thank you, I thought I would be the only one for second.  And might I just add...something something Kawhi Leonard"
"Kawhi destroyed the Sixers, yes, but had a noticeably harder time when Simmons played on him.   Quoting an article from the time re: Ben on Leonard:  ‚ÄúHe has now held Leonard to 12-of-25 shooting (0-of-9 from 3) and two turnovers through two games.‚Äù  ‚Äú For context of just how big an impact Simmons has made, consider Leonard has torched the rest of the Sixers with 17-of-22 shooting (6-of-8 from 3) and only one turnover. Without Simmons, Leonard would have been walking towards another 40- to 50-point game.‚Äù  Scorers gonna score. The key is to make them inefficient at least. Ben doesn‚Äôt give you as much on offense but he can at least slow down  other players."
"This isn't a ""big market"" thing its a ""disproportionate injury"" thing.  &amp;#x200B;  2019 was huge even when KD was out because there were familiar faces in Kawhi/Steph still playing. The WCF was bad because like... and I say this as someone who watched and enjoyed the games, the casual fans don't wanna watch a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard. Sometimes its not about the teams location its about who you beat. If the Clips were healthy even if the suns won I don't think the WCF would have low vierership.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm gonna watch because I like watching basketball but whose really stoked to see Brook Lopez vs Clint Capela to decide whose gonna go to the NBA finals?"
"Kawhi Leonard handles, CP3 from 3-10 ft near GOAT level for a non center, Harden's athleticism at the rim was better than people realized for a long time(kind of dissipated now within the past 2 yrs some), Durant a historic level finisher at the rim, Paul George is one of the best for his size Ive ever seen getting over screens(although has dipped in that with age), Westbrook tends to be a real accurate passer, Tatum has massive career splits on shots &gt;10 ft from the left vs right side of the court which means from the left he's top tier."
He played very solid defense on Leonard in that Raps series. If he doesn‚Äôt take that assignment the Sixers get swept because he was the only guy remotely slowing down Kawhi.
Ahhh the Kawhi Leonard approach...
2021 Clippers.  You take the team with the best player.  Best player - Kawhi Leonard
"It's 100% because of the injury angle, the feet thing wasn't a foul until a few years ago after Kawhi Leonard got injured"
"Kinda sucks.  Clippers are my favorite Western Conference team, but I can't stand the guy.  At least they have Kawhi Leonard."
"If I‚Äôm Atlanta, I‚Äôm going to be one of the teams going hard after Kawhi this summer. Yeah he‚Äôs probably going to stay with the clippers, but a Trae Young Kawhi Leonard pick and roll flanked by Bogonavic, Collins, and Capela would be nicee"
It's the Kawhi Leonard rule from all those years ago
The fact that he's Kawhi Leonard means he's going to be hurt. It's his thing. He's one of the most injury prone stars in the league. Same applies to AD.
"The Clippers were fucked by injuries, that's the point. It should've been another year of Kawhi competing for a title but then he got hurt. I don't give a fuck what franchise he's playing for, it doesn't change the fact that he's Kawhi Leonard. His injury is also what made it a wide open title.  And yes, the Hawks have suffered from injuries with one of their best players being out for the entire postseason and now not having Trae Young for two games. Again, that's bad. Not good. Worsens the product."
"Doc's record should be good, he coached T-mac, KG, Pierce, Rondo, Ray Allen, Chris Paul, Shaq, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, etc.   This doesn't mean he's good, a little bit of smoke and mirrors in those numbers IMO."
"&gt; When he's healthy  Let's look at his health in the playoffs in recent years though, before we just pencil in a fully healthy Kawhi Leonard going forward:  * **2017** - Kawhi sprains his ankle against Houston in Game 5 of the 2nd round and [is forced to miss Game 6](https://youtu.be/y9sgxZfCK-c?t=165), but [the Spurs win anyway without him.](https://youtu.be/DYDHks7b-Ik?t=11) Kawhi returns for Game 1 of the WCF but re-injures that ankle when [Zaza gets underneath him on a jumpshot](https://youtu.be/bouRf8a7L7Q) and Kawhi misses the rest of the playoffs.  * **2018** - Kawhi misses most of the season with quad tendinosis, but the Spurs make the playoffs anyway. Kawhi doesn't join his team during their first round loss to the Warriors, and then demands a trade a couple weeks later.  * **2019** - Kawhi does extensive load managing throughout the season, but [he suffers a knee injury in Game 4 of the ECF,](https://youtu.be/a33_N-Ljd-E?t=101) but his team steps up and he's able to continue playing throughout the rest of the playoffs and the Raptors win the title.  * **2020** - Kawhi again does extensive load managing throughout the season, then gets a 4 month break (along with everyone else) due to the pandemic and stays healthy throughout the bubble, but his team is eliminated in the 2nd round  * **2021** - Kawhi doesn't do much load managing at all throughout the season, and [suffers an ACL injury](https://youtu.be/d2iDnKPyxvw) after 12 playoff games, going down in Game 5 against Utah."
"Don't stop there.  The Suns beat a Lakers team missing Anthony Davis, a Nuggets team missing Jamal Murray and a Clippers team missing Kawhi Leonard.  Flip *any* of those injuries and the Suns would have been the underdog."
Or the second year player was asked something along the lines of ‚Äúdo you think Paul George and kawhi Leonard grew as leaders this year?‚Äù
"Are you serious?  Yes, Kawhi Leonard makes the Clippers a better team. This is a really really bad take  &gt;They went from struggling with the 5 seed to beating the 1 seed and being a few FTs away from a 3-1 lead on the 2 seed.  In large part because of Kawhi they beat that 5 seed, and then won games 3 and 4 against the 1 seed with him. Without him they have also had success, but they haven't been beating the all Star team"
"There are several other QBs that are better statistically and talent wise *right now* but Tom has real intangible value despite being a worse on the field player.  It matters that when he shows up you either get your shit together and believe you‚Äôre going to win the super bowl or you can literally get the fuck off of his team   Kawhi Leonard is *significantly better at basketball* at this point in time but his own value is his statistics (which are very [very] important and very [very] good).  If you only look at Chris Paul‚Äôs statistics (contract aside) then you are not bringing his intangible value into the equation,  He took what was supposed to be an overwhelmingly shitty OKC team to the brink of beating the Rockets and every player gave him the credit.  He‚Äôs taking a team that just missed the bubble last year to the finals this year and [every player is giving him credit](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/deandre-ayton-says-chris-paul-is-the-best-thing-that-happened-to-my-career/).  Yes - I know Chris Paul is not *as good as Kawhi Leonard at the moment at the game of basketball* and yes I know Chris Paul *isn‚Äôt Tom Brady*"
I think the biggest problem for the clippers was Kawhi Leonard
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
"Kawhi Leonard is like getting  case of bananas. Great if used up in a hurry, will draw flies of left on your team too long. He should be a Revis type mercenary only. Don't keep that cancer on your teams."
"I'm a life long laker fan. I have always also been a big fan of Kawhi Leonard. I'm from San Diego and have followed him since his time at SDSU.   I loved Kawhi with the Spurs and of course when he did his thing with The Raptors.    Despite my appreciation for Kawhis awesome talent and overall game, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth to see him on the clippers. It just feels wrong and ugly to my inner basketball soul.   I would actually love to see him team up with Luka in Dallas. That 2 man tandem seems amazing and quite scary. They would likely dominate.   With all that said I have a feeling Kawhi will stay with the clippers, sadly."
&gt;With the elimination of Kawhi Leonard and Rajon Rondo on the LA Clippers  and Ibaka
"‚Ä¶Harden was very much known as an iron man before this season. This year he missed the first playoff games of his career.  He‚Äôs played in 90% of possible games for his career. I have no idea what point you‚Äôre trying to make here.   Besides, you‚Äôre comparing them to Kawhi Leonard lol."
"Probably still far off, soccer‚Äôs overall revenue is in another stratosphere  [538 tried to look at this in 2015](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhi-leonard-like-all-the-best-nba-players-is-vastly-underpaid/) and said he was about 30 million dollars underpaid on an annual basis, based purely on wins added, but I‚Äôm sure he was worth even more from a marketing standpoint."
I suggest they add a healthy Kawhi Leonard!
"I think they're in a very good spot honestly. They'll re-sign Kawhi for the max, so before any other moves they've got almost a full team returning. The early Bird rights on Reggie Jackson should be enough to keep him, and then they still have the MLE, the bi-annual exception, and about 5 million in trade exceptions. Plus a first rounder. They really shouldn't be discouraged at all. A healthy rotation of PatBev, Jackson, PG, Leonard, Mann, Kennard, Morris, Zubac, and Ibaka is really nice before they add anyone. The MLE could easily replace Batum or improve on their backup wing situation."
IKR? Why do team like the Clippers sign All Time Great players coming off a championship and a FMVP like Kawhi Leonard and try to build around him when they can simply try to get out of the West with a team deep team built around Pat Bev and Lou Williams? SMFH
"Went through both LA teams..  one without AD and a hobbled LeBron,  and the other without Kawhi Leonard.    Who woulda thought!"
Kawhi leonard literally didn‚Äôt miss in the fourth quarter for any of the wins we had before the injury.
"Completely ridiculous. They lost to the Clippers in 6 who were a top championship contender with Kawhi, and still great even without him. They also lost Mike Conley, who was an All-Star. That‚Äôs a pretty massive hit for the team to take when trying to take down a team as good as the Clippers with Leonard. Saying they got exposed when they lost to a top team without one of their All-Stars is just dumb."
"Nothing - except for Kawhi's injury, of course. Suns could have still won even with Kawhi, but it would have been a long shot with a healthy Leonard - nobody expected them to even get past the Conley-less Jazz without the Klaw, and they forced a game 6 even with CP3's return. Honestly, a really great run for the Clips all things considered."
Mikal and then he becomes the next Kawhi Leonard
Mikal Bridges gonna win fmvp and starts his Kawhi Leonard transformation trajectory arc.
Yeah bro it's a conspiracy. Kawhi Leonard turned the frogs gay
"The funny thing about this whole exchange here is that of the players we're talking about, [only Kawhi has reportedly been unhappy with his team's medical/training staff.](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/clippers-kawhi-leonard-miss-game-6-knee-injury.amp) It's ok, projection is a common coping mechanism. I get it."
Kawhi Leonard is much better than Chris Paul in 2021. Just saying.
"The fuck? You‚Äôre comparing injuries to Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard all in one run to what the Lakers faced last year? Suns fans have gone off the deep end lmao.  The Lakers probably would‚Äôve beat the full strength Heat anyways. The Suns probably would‚Äôve lost to the Lakers and Clippers."
"LOL yeah bro, Kawhi Leonard and 36 year old Chris Paul getting injured are equal. Good one. The Suns would‚Äôve been a first round exit if the Lakers were healthy. Cope."
No. Look at Kawhi Leonard. Idk how many seasons he‚Äôs played but not many will remember him as a Raptor but more so as a Spur and a Clipper.
How's this for a line up of players with shitty rookie years:  James Harden  Kobe Bryant  Kawhi Leonard  Demar DeRozan  Dirk Nowitzki
he's a dirty dirty player. seriously hate that guy. belongs on that team with wayoff P and Kawhi load management Leonard.
Anthony Davis Jamal Murray  kawhi Leonard and now either giannis or tray
"Kawhi Leonard was averaging 31 on 68TS% this playoffs, that‚Äôs what the Suns didn‚Äôt go against for a whole series so I‚Äôll let you interpret that"
"Right up there with ""Kawhi Leonard going crazy"" Mike Breen is a legend."
I am proud of the Clippers for not forcing Kawhi Leonard back the way the Lakers did with Davis. They just played really hard.  I have always liked the Clippers and would have rooted for them if they beat the Suns.
"Kawhi ""load manage"" leonard happy as hell he get to rest now."
No Anthony Davis No Jamal Murray No Kawhi Leonard and No Giannis or Trae Young Suns ring should come with a pair of crutches
"Kawhi Leonard missing these last couple of games is going to haunt the Clippers, but I‚Äôm positive it won‚Äôt haunt the Suns.  Congratulations Suns."
Now I can dip my monstrous toe into GSW Building and see what's going on over there before making my Cali team selection. - Kawhi Leonard
"Suddenly Steve Ballmer comes from the tunnel and unleashes kawhi leonard, his knee has been replaced with giannis' remaining healthy knee  don't ask what happened to Giannis"
"""*I'm quietly judging all of you.*"" - Kawhi Leonard"
"hypothetically if Lebron James retires today, it would take Kawhi Leonard 22 addition years just equal LeBron James total points"
If Kawhi Leonard showed up with an afro would you be against it?
Does Kawhi Leonard hate his family? He isn‚Äôt watching the game with them.
Kawhi Leonard on the bench tonight GOING CRAZY
"Ty Lue often gets the majority of the spotlight and credit when it comes to coaching, but let‚Äôs not overlook the rest of the coaching staff. They have all played a major role in helping the clippers get to where they are right now without Kawhi Leonard."
"Everything Kawhi Leonard was thinking about from the moment Zaza Pachulia injured him, to when he signed with the Clippers."
&gt; Kawhi Leonard: can‚Äôt depend on him physically or emotionally.  Robots don't have emotions.

"But, who's going to be their Steve Kerr or Nick Nurse? You're talking about two guys who are on a *very* short list of coaches who won a championship in their very first year being a head coach. The only other one I can think of is Pat Riley.  You're really underestimating how much luck and rare skill it takes for that to fall into place. The idea that you can so easily replicate any of what happened at either of those teams is a bit delusional. The Bucks don't have an elite guard or wing like Steph Curry or Kawhi Leonard. Nick Nurse hasn't really sustained any of that success, the Raptors are imploding in his third year already. Not to mention there are already 3 other coaching vacancies that you'll be competing with for talent right now."
"I wouldn't even use Kobe because Kobe modeled his game off Michael so thoroughly that he was basically a C- version of Jordan (which is not a diss on Kobe, Jordan was simply that good).  He was like.... Imagine if you took prime Westbrook's speed, finishing ability, court vision, athleticism, &amp; aggressiveness,  Durant's mid-range stroke, and you gave that all to Kawhi Leonard.  edit: just wanna say, after thinking about this, Kobe arguably had superior post-footwork to Michael.  Kobe might have been a more cerebral player than Michael too, honestly"

"I think in previous years there were good enough reasonings to excuse Paul from failing during the playoffs. This year has to be it imo. People saying he's old don't really have a point as he's playing like a lite version of Bron, so he's still definitely good enough and safe for this series Paul has been the suns best player in the playoffs and also during the regular season. He's their leader, the most experienced player and still immensely skilled. People claiming he's injured - the entire league is injured. No top 10 player is still healthy/in the playoffs. He contracted covid which is still possible if vaccinated but he was asymptomatic as expected once you've received a vax shot. The clippers play without kawhi Leonard while Paul has a really deep and balanced roster at his hands with Booker and Ayton being healthy (Booker may be a bit hindered but many stars played signature games with a broken nose and a face mask), rising stars playing great playoffs in their own right. The Suns are the best team left and this ring is a must for Paul imo. Bad injury luck is one thing but this year will be very hard to live down if he fails against this hobbled Clippers team or the hawks/Giannis-less Bucks."
"Can‚Äôt believe Kawhi Leonard would go to Tokyo just to shoot a few shots, but not join Team USA"
Never knew Kawhi Leonard was Ben Simmons nemesis
"Why don't the US ever put a full strength team forward?? The arrogance of assuming any team we put out will win is astounding.  In 1992 NBA players were fighting for the opportunity to make the olympic team, but now players think it's not worth their time.  How can we call this an olympic level US team with no James Harden, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul or Bradley Beal?????  But instead we got Keldon Johnson, Javalle Mcgee and Draymond Green? Are you kidding me???"

"LeBron James, Steph curry, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant are all ahead of Luka and Giannis."
"&gt;Steph, Lebron, or any other player would also not improve their chances.  Yes, adding LeBron James, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden would not improve their chances."
In 2019 Kawhi Leonard averaged 26 per game on 61% TS and James Harden averaged 36 per game on 62% TS. By your metric Kawhi and Harden wouldn‚Äôt be comparable players in 2019.
"With all due respect to JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, Jrue Holiday (who played well), and even my home team guy Jerami Grant, I wouldn't lose much sleep if I were presented with the opportunity to replace them with healthy versions of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kawhi Leonard."
"This same exact block of text was written in 2004.   &gt;Yeah you can argue they are not as stacked as they could be  Folks seem to gloss over this as though it's an afterthought but this is how it's been for decades now. If Team USA doesn't send the best of the best, things can get variably dicey.   Everyone was convinced the world had not only caught up to the USA, but perhaps even surpassed them in the mid-2000's. Then when USA got their minds right and actually sent the cavalry the next time out (2008), we got original Dream Team types of results.   Circumstances are different this year because so many stars are out with injuries (as opposed to just opting out like they did in the 2000's). But you can't leave these guys at home...  * LeBron James  * Stephen Curry  * Anthony Davis  * Klay Thompson  * Kyrie Irving  * James Harden  * Donovan Mitchell   * Paul George  * Kawhi Leonard  ... and then turn around and casually be like, ""I know we didn't send our best but still."" There's literally a Dream Team sitting home and for a long time now, when those guys aren't in the fold, nothing's a sure thing."
"You literally do not know what the negotiations were. Reports were that the Lakers made an opening offer, then Pop responded with [a counter offer so absurd](https://thespun.com/news/spurs-lakers-kawhi-leonard-trade-package/amp) that it gave the Lakers the impression that [he'd slammed the door in their faces.](https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1009885902435278848?s=19) Reports later came out from Woj that Pop had taken a stance that [he would not have traded Kawhi to the Lakers under any circumstances.](https://news4sanantonio.com/amp/sports/spurs-zone/spurs-reportedly-would-not-trade-kawhi-leonard-to-lakers-no-matter-what)  So if you're wondering why the Lakers never got beyond that initial offer, now you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say all the Spurs got was Brandon Ingram and a pick. Isn't that better than Poeltl and a pick? Ingram is a 23 year old All Star under contract for the next 4 years. Wouldn't you rather have Ingram? DeRozan is likely gone, and you could have drafted Keldon Johnson with the Lakers pick just as easy as you did with the Raptors' 29th pick. Who else is left? I'd rather have Ingram personally."
"yeah i mean you're comparing laimbeer to 3 of GOAT centers... hakeem olajuwon for example, even beyond his position, can be argued to be a top 5 player of all time. if bill laimbeer can make it as a starter in today's USA national team, then that says a lot about today's NBA. like you said, it especially speaks of the drought of US-big men in the NBA. their best big men are international players.  for sure a shortened offseason should be factored in, but the whole world faced complications against the pandemic. a lot of international players also play in the NBA, so it's an even handicap imo.  i watched the USA vs France game in 2019 (check it out if you haven't), and it seems like the common denominator is your last point.. most of them are ""superstars"" on their team and don't know how to really play team-ball as a consequence. their teams are structured in a way where the team revolves around them as a center piece. now all those players come together thinking they're the justice league, when really they're just confused on how to play together.  so yes, these players are individually athletically talented, more than previous generations. their talents, however, are capped- They lack the talent of being able to play on any team. Guys in previous Olympic teams knew how to play with each other, despite not being on the same team... and that talent is more important in team sports, like basketball. This isn't tennis.. sometimes basketball is like tennis, when you're playing 1-on-1. Too bad there isn't a 1-on-1 professional league watched by millions of viewers on television. These guys would excel at it.  the problem is, everyone wants to be ""jordan,"" yet even jordan wasn't the leading scorer of the dream team. he played his ROLE.. and they let charles barkley do most of the scoring because his body/strength/basketball ability was kryptonite for every other team. they all served their roles and no one tried to be a star, most of them never played with each other, but gel'd immediately. maybe it's just the culture that's in the states right now, everybody wants to be ""That guy,"" but the real ""that guy""s knew how to do it all, and that's what US kids aren't seeing. Even watching the Redeem Team.. man they were ferocious on the court and playing beautiful team ball. Kobe wasn't even the leading scorer, but again, like Jordan, he played his role.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm sure if the team consisted of Lebron/Steph/Klay/Durant/Draymond/Myles Turner/Dwight Howard/Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Kawhi Leonard.. they'd be beating everybody. First, 4 of them have played together on the same team. Second, LeBron can fit on any team because his game is like Magic Johnson's, he just fits on any team. Dwight Howard is old but he's tough now, plays bully bull on his limited minutes, and he played on the Redeem Team like LeBron. Myles Turner and Brook Lopez are the only American-born Centers who are better than all the other American Centers who have been in it for 5+ years. Myles Turner is a liability because he would've gotten destroyed by Gobert (see footage of Pacers vs Jazz games). It's sad that team USA would have to have him as a Center because he's young/has more stamina than Brook and Dwight, but doesn't have an aggressive rebounding nature against REAL centers. Rotate minutes. Jrue Holiday knows how to play proper defence and is a team player. Klay is one of the NBA's elite defenders. Kawhi, elite defender. If you had Jrue, Klay, Kawhi, Draymond, and Dwight Howard all on the floor at the same time.. It's gonna be a loooooong day for all the opposing teams.  &amp;#x200B;  finally, no disrespect to popovich, but these lineups have been questionable (even the plays ran in the 2019 game). i don't know if he's the right coach for this team"
(*insert clever Kawhi Leonard robot joke*)
"Turns out Popovich is just a guy that backstabbed another guy to steal the coaching job so he can get all the credit from Tim Duncan.  Is Popovich good, or did he just get to coach David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Kawhi Leonard, special talents carrying him to championships?"
Kawhi Leonard in shambles
&gt;Kawhi Leonard went to Jays game after winning the chip  I mean... that's after winning a championship lol. Much different then about to likely be drafted
"Obviously top ten, borderline top 5.  Most people seem to agree Lebron, KD, Steph, and Giannis are in the top 5.  The debate comes down to Wade vs Kawhi Leonard and James Harden.    I'd take Wade over Harden. I place a lot of value in defense, and there is no question who the better defender is.  Wade was also a better playoff performer.    Wade vs Kawhi is a tough one.  Wade was a better scorer, while Kawhi was a better defender.  Both were screwed by injuries.  As much as I hate to admit it, I'd probably take Kawhi by the closest of margins.  I like his offensive tool kit a little more than Wade's.  This one is pretty much a toss up though."
IDK. I think 1 year of Beal is probably closer to 1 year of Jrue Holiday or Kawhi Leonard than 2 years of James Harden.

"Marcus Smart, Kawhi Leonard, most good stealers   Theres Smart defensive highlights on timi's youtube page. Watch them."
"kawhi leonard literally just came, won a championship, and then left."
I'm sure you could find quotes of them doing similar things. Kawhi Leonard went to Jays game after winning the chip. My guess is top prospects care less about the city they're drafted to as long as it looks like they could be competitive for the better part of 7 years. Worry less that your star likes the city and more that you put a well built team around them.
Spurs drafted Kawhi Leonard after a 60 win season
"&gt; Even guys like George and Kawhi stopped being a shut down defender after they became better scorers.  Funny you mention those two names.

"And then he ended up in LA a year later lol. Here‚Äôs some quotes from an Athletic article about it:  &gt; on July 3, the Clippers received word that George wanted out of Oklahoma City and Leonard had been recruiting George to ask for a trade to team up with him and the Clippers. There are conflicting accounts on Leonard‚Äôs involvement in recruiting George. For the record, it should be stated that a source told Charania that it is ‚Äúnot accurate‚Äù that Leonard recruited George to demand a trade and come to the Clippers. George sensed this was a special opportunity to head back home to Southern California, collaborate with one of the game‚Äôs best players in Leonard, contend for championships and join a like-minded organization in the Clippers.   &gt; When George went to the Thunder and informed them that he wanted to go to the Clippers, it changed everything for Oklahoma City. He was the domino. From there, Westbrook and his agent, Thad Foucher, engaged in discussions with Presti about what it all meant. Eight days later ‚Äî and six days after the report of George being traded to the Clippers ‚Äî Westbrook had been dealt to Houston.  I notice you didn‚Äôt respond to my points about Kawhi and KD either. And the KD situation is probably more similar than others given that a big part of his motivation was playing with his friend."
23 year old Kawhi Leonard couldnt hold 2019-2021 Giannis's jock strap. This isnt recency bias its just hilariously overrating what 2014 Kawhi Leonard was which is a role player who in the 2014 NBA Finals 75% of his shots came off 0 or 1 dribble. Completely different player. 22 year old Giannis in 2017 &gt;&gt; 23 year old 2014 Kawhi Leonard.
"But you aren't accounting for the ""less cosmopolitan"" Kawhi Leonard from Southern California whose been traveling around the country and world for nearly a decade."
 Kawhi Leonard is cooking up a storm
"We gave up Poetl, the 4th best young player, a lottery protected pick, and Demar for Kawhi fucking Leonard not the fourth pick and Siakam for Bradley geez Beal."
I save every one of my (usually terrible) hot takes in case I need to shove them in faces in the future. I learned that when I suggested on a realgm forum back in 2012 that the Pistons should trade Greg Monroe for Kawhi Leonard (https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1222640) and got a lot of shit for it at the time.
he‚Äôs great at team development and the players love him. he‚Äôs part of the reason Jerami Grant signed with detroit. and lets be honest the real block you had in the playoffs was not having kawhi leonard.
"you're all praising this guy for picking giannis - and good for him - but he  he also really picked andrew wiggins and stanley johnson, and said this:  &gt; ***Kawhi Leonard is extremely overrated, a good player, but is gaining success under Popovich and because of the players around him  it's an L overall for sure"
Lebron James and Kawhi Leonard because the dubs can get anyone right!
"What I remember: Luka posting up Kawhi, and scoring. A point guard, posting up Kawhi? You dont see that every day. Also, the Clippers may have had one of the best playoff runs in modern NBA history, and I say that as a Mavs fan. Just beating us after we were up 2-0 is impressive, even though Clips were favored. But to beat Utah without Leonard, and win two games against the Suns without Leonard is one hell of a job I dont think they get enough credit for. I'll never slander PG again...at least until next year."

"1. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both go to the Lakers 2. Chris Paul wants to go to the Lakers only to be turned down because of the salary cap issue and stays with the Suns instead 3. Lillard doesn't stay in Portland, but gets surprisingly traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown 4. Spencer Dinwiddle goes to the Clippers 5. The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the OKC thunder in exchange for Kemba and 2 first round picks and flip Tobias and those picks to the Blazers for CJ McCollum, Simons and Covington 6. Lonzo goes to the Bulls 7. Kawhi Leonard stays with the Clippers"
"yeah man. I wanted to tank but people can't act like tanking has helped anybody but the Suns all that much. I'm sorry Kings and Wolves fans, but I'm pretty content as it is. Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, and Donovan Mitchell were late lottery picks. it's not the worst thing in the world.   all we have to do is let DeMar go and we're gonna go from the 12 pick to top 7 almost unless someone takes a big step which would be what we want anyway. lol"
"ok and again, the mavs didn't have their starting 2guard who averaged 15 ppg, and still beat lebron james. if lebron had won, you would go ""see he's the greatest!"" and you would have no notion that the starting 2 guard of the mavs was not in play.   There are defensive molds that bother lebron james. take his reaction to kawhi leonard coming in.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtlMEC\_HAzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtlMEC_HAzU)  &amp;#x200B;  yes, he fell completely apart because the mavericks played great defense on him. shawn marion is one of the best defenders the game has ever seen (length, foot speed, explosive vertical). jason kidd has the bulk and foot speed to bother him, and not be bullied on drives by lebron's size. deshawn stevenson, great defensive ace as well. tyson chandler, one of the best paint defender centers there has been in the nba.   &amp;#x200B;  the heat did not ever improve that much. the thunder were a lackluster team loaded with talent, but stunted by chemistry issues (the heat were superior and won with both teams full force).  the spurs were the superior team both years. 2013's win is one of the few in nba history where the worse team came out on top."
"If there is any such thing as a safe bet, it's that KL is retiring in LA. Say it with me: *""Kawhi Leonard is retiring in Los Angeles.""* What in the name of god makes anybody think this dude is gonna leave LA? Money? Glory? Rings? Roster?   Money? He took less money to demand a trade from SA to end up in Toronto. And then he took less money to leave Toronto and go to LA. But maybe he wanted to be in LA for more/better sponsorships? Idk, do you see the guy anywhere besides the occasional New Balance spot? Can you list two products that Kawhi is affiliated with besides his shoes?   Glory? You think the guy who turned down the shot to be Tim Duncan's heir apparent is in it for glory? The guy who would have been royalty in SA for the rest of his life, prolonged one of the greatest runs in the history of sports, and featured on our basketball Mount Rushmore of all-time greats? The same guy who could have stayed in Toronto and proclaimed himself the supreme ruler of all of goddamn Canada if he wanted to, with 100% approval?   Rings? Does anybody think KL has a better shot of winning more rings with the goddamn CLIPPERS than he did in TOR or SA ‚Äî you know, where he won two rings?   Maybe he wanted to surround himself with a better roster for the long term? So he went to the Clippers ‚Äî  a team that basically kneecapped themselves for the next decade just to add PG and KL?   Pretty much any way you look at it, on the surface, Kawhi has given up money, glory, rings, and better teammates to go play in LA. Y'all can try to figure out what this man wants, but I really think the guy just wants to play basketball and live in Cali."
"Stein's tweet is based off his own message that he wrote here - which basically says jack shit LOL  &amp;#x200B;  ""The Clippers‚Äô Kawhi Leonard, like Paul, has to decide whether to exercise a pricey player option ($36 million) or head to free agency in August. Unlike Paul, Leonard must do so while facing long-term injury uncertainty after it was announced this week that he underwent surgery on a partially torn ACL in his right knee and is out indefinitely.   The most likely scenario, league sources say, remains Leonard opting out to re-sign with the Clippers ‚Äî or, in Steve Ballmer‚Äôs worst nightmare, to shock the league by signing elsewhere. Leonard‚Äôs well-known affinity for Southern California has led various rival front offices to presume that he would have no interest in switching teams for the third time, but the notion that Leonard is unattainable seems to be waning a bit as the Aug. 2 start of free agency nears.   Dallas, just to name one expected suitor, will not be dissuaded from pursuing Leonard even if he‚Äôs forced to miss all of next season, league sources say. Leonard‚Äôs situation is frequently likened to Kevin Durant‚Äôs free agency in 2019 after Durant had sustained a torn Achilles tendon in the Finals. Brooklyn furnished Durant with a four-year, $164 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with Golden State, with the Nets knowing they would have to play a whole season without him. Even at 30 and with a worrisome injury history, Leonard appears capable of generating similar interest."""
"People always say this, but ""rebuilding"" isn't as easy as it's made out to be.  Even with Tim, Tony, and Manu...the Spurs were a ""pretender"" team from like 2008-2011. Looked like Timmy was declining, Tony and Manu were battling injuries, and the Spurs went out in the first or second round a few times. Lots of San Antonio fans were clamoring for a rebuild at that point.  All of a sudden, the Spurs trade George Hill for the rights to draft Kawhi Leonard at #15, they pluck Boris Diaw off the buyout market, and boom...the window reopened and they went WCF, Finals, Finals (and championship) in three years (and would have challenged for more if not for a miraculous shot by CP3)  It's not always as simple as ""let's just toss everything out the window and start over with a bunch of draft picks""."
Mavs are simps for every big free agent for the last 10 years lmao. It‚Äôs never going to happen and it‚Äôs certainly not going to happen with fucking Kawhi Leonard lmao

Don't bother searching for it on his twitter feed though, he removed it."

"This will be in every single NBA Playoffs/Finals commercial until Liam Antetokounmpo wins his 1st FMVP 22 years from now.  And every single time I see it, I'll be forever grateful to Giannis, Khris, Brook, Portis, and even Bud. This team perfectly encapsulates the personality of MKE, and champions or not, this group resonated with our city and state more than any other WI sports team since at least the '96 Packers.  In winning a championship they won over our hearts in the process.  The 2019 group may have been ""better"" as far as W-L record or ORTG or point differential, but this team perfectly culturally captured the collective soul of the city.   This team will always go down as more than a basketball team for us here, they'll go down as a beacon of hope in a normally hopesick city.   A group of 15 people that meshed harmoniously to unite 600,000.   A team that reminded us if we work together, great things can happen in this city.  We've gotten to grow up, and glow up, with Giannis. 8 years ago the whole city was metaphorically running to work because we couldn't afford a cab since we had just MoneyGrammed the last of our scratch to our family that needed it more than us.   We've all had moments where life pulls a Kawhi Leonard on us and dunks ferociously on our head to end our title hopes.  We've all wondered what greener pastures might be like, but the love we have for our city has kept us here, despite what people on the outside say about it.   Giannis had those thoughts, but he remembered we embraced him when he came here as a culture shocked Greek immigrant that was 6'8"" and 103 lbs.   He's grown to 6'11 and went from 103 lbs to 260, but he never needed to bulk up his heart, and he remembered how this city showed him love when he needed it most, so he returned the favor and signed the extension early to show us that same love back.  He's the perfect Wisconsin athlete. He's not a California OC Drama Queen that we claim we love but really just put up with because he's great at his job. He's a diamond in the rough, that ended up in a rough place that needed a diamond to shine."
Yes Kawhi Leonard was having a better playoff run than Curry ever had before he got injured
&gt; [RDAmbition] Breaking News: Kawhi Leonard to Lakers is officially done. Both sides working on minor details at the moment before announcing deal.
"Does your city have an NBA team that has won a championship that you slept through? Toronto was one big all night party after the win so it would be pretty difficult for someone in the city not to know what happened. 2 million people flooded the streets of our downtown area for the parade a few days later  You got downvoted for saying ""no"" to my experience without countering it with any similar circumstances. My Grandma doesn't watch basketball anymore, but virtually everyone paid attention at the time we won because it dominated conversations and news cycles. There were people jumping on top of street cars, incessant honking/fireworks through ought all boroughs. You couldn't live in Toronto without wondering what the fuck was going on, and you couldn't turn on the news without seeing our city council begging Kawhi Leonard to stay lol"

"(a) KD and Steph (the comparisons in this post) did not get injured either in 2012 and 2015, so no that part is irrelevant  (b) ""others are just too fragile (AD / Durant / Kawhi / etc)"" this is also irrelevant because the fragility of kawhi leonard, for instance, is not something in giannis' control. the fragility of wade/bosh was not something in KD's control. which is my point... *you're judging players by factors out of their control*"
He‚Äôs like Kawhi Leonard except signs with small markets and doesn‚Äôt force out trades and is really outgoing and actually the only similarity they share is that both appear to be good guys to strangers
"Lol. The circle jerk about ""SmALl MArKEt vS suPeRtEAm"" is nauseating.  Where was Giannis realistically going to go that put him in a better situation to win a title?  And, out of pure curiosity, where are all these ""superteams"" located?!? Is he talking about when the Bulls brought in Rodman/Harper/Kukoc to be paired with MJ and Pippen? Cause I really hope that no one is trying to say LeBron teaming with Kevin Love or Kawhi Leonard pairing with Paul George is a god damn superteam.   The only real example is KD joining the Warriors."
"Bro ESPN asked Kawhi Leonard where hes going next year during the trophy presentation after the Raptors won, stop being surprised by them"
"bullshit qualifiers? Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard not playing is ""bullshit""?  you really think under normal circumstances that they get to the finals? really dude?  and how young are they really with 36 year old injury prone CP3 as their engine?"
"I don't know if it really changes anything in regards to superstars/all-stars on small market teams.  The Spurs have won 5 titles but not every fan thinks much of them.  The Cavs won in 2016 with the help of drafting players like Kyrie and TT, getting back Lebron, and trading for Kevin Love.  The Toronto Raptors, even though they may not be considered a small market team, technically, won in 2019 when they took a gamble and traded their loyal franchise player in DeMar Derozan and got Kawhi Leonard.  As a small market, when you have a great talent on your hands, you have to be mindful of their timeline. While not every player is looking to leave, a player that is trying to be in the caliber of the best players in the world may start losing patience. You need a competent front office that is willing to take a risk, if needed, and gauge carefully on the needs of the team surrounding their best player(s). The Bucks have done that and got rewarded with a championship this year. The Spurs are known as a top organization thanks to their front office and the players that established that winning culture (i.e., Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili)."
I mean if you want to give him props sure but don‚Äôt act like Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard existed in this playoff run then
"There‚Äôs a difference between losing Goran dragic and losing ad, Jamal Murray, or kawhi fucking Leonard lmao.   No one thinks Miami would‚Äôve somehow beat us last year if dragic was healthy(we were missing our starting point guard too btw).  Almost everyone thinks lakers and clippers would‚Äôve beat Phoenix if healthy. Tons of people think Denver would‚Äôve beaten them too. People still bring up the raptors in 2019 winning Bc kd and klay went down. Some even bring up 2015 still.   It‚Äôs what happens when you get lucky, people talk about it. People are gonna talk about the bucks only winning because Brooklyn died once the dust settles too. It doesn‚Äôt make the winning team worse, context is just important."
Kawhi Leonard going crazy!
"Kawhi leonard is up there, Steph curry still is"
"You‚Äôre seriously overrating them, they literally beat every team that had major injuries, how can‚Äôt you see it?  -Lakers major injuries  -Nuggets major injury, all star level guard gone..  - kawhi Leonard literally top 5 player injured and still anyone could‚Äôve won that series lol"
Finals Giannis is Kawhi Leonard scary.
Make sure one of them is Kawhi Leonard

"[My first mention of Middleton where I compared him to a combination of Jimmy Butler, Harrison Barnes, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jg3w2/get_to_know_a_new_buck_brandon_knight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  I am a long time believer"
"That fact that you said Terance mann hung 40 on his neck absolutely proves me point, that you do not watch the Jazz play. Again, scheme was to let them shoot 3s and guard the paint, which is exactly how Mann scored 40 lol.   *Gobert defended 1,335 shots this year, 184 more than anyone else. The 267 3-point shots he defended are the fourth most among 67 NBA Centers, and also more than Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart, OG Anunoby, and Kawhi Leonard. He‚Äôs defended the seventh most shots in isolation (78), and the most shots attempted on cuts to the basket (229). It‚Äôs safe to say Gobert puts himself out there in terms of guarding every player on every play more than anyone in the league.*  Here's one of the many articles you can find that show what you are saying is just blatantly wrong.  https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/  Homer or not, my point &gt; yours. lol"
CP3 =\= Kawhi Leonard my guy
"I'm not saying he isn't a top 5 player, he is and has been for a very long time, he just isn't better than Kevin Durant. KD played with an injured squad against a fully loaded Bucks team, his degree of difficulty in that series was way higher and he still had better overrall stats and look better to everyone watching.  Is Giannis's defense better than KD's? Yes, but so is PG13 or Kawhi Leonard and neither are better than Durant. This is insanity, if they flipped situations in that ECSF, KD wins and Giannis loses, KD outplayed him and lost because Harden couldn't move and Kyrie was out while Giannis had both of his All-Stars alongside him.  This isn't hard, they played H2H and KD dropped 35/11/5 on 59% TS with no help, in fact after Kyrie went down, KD averaged 43/12/6 in a three game stretch as his team got eliminated, how is this even a discussion is beyond me.  Giannis is the best two way player in the game today and a Top 5 player in the league, but that doesn't mean that he is better than Kevin Durant or LeBron James. His team was healthy and he won, their teams weren't. Like i said, this is Kawhi in 2019 all over again, if KD was in the Bucks and Giannis on the Nets, KD would be in the Finals right now, injuries decided that series."
Kawhi Leonard for Othello who says no
"Kawhi‚Äôs a very tough argument. If you‚Äôre going by DeRozen‚Äôs words, Ujiri and he had just talked about running it back and improving two days before Ujiri called him to tell him he was trading him for Kawhi.   The team president sacrificed the face of the franchise for a two way cyborg that delivered Toronto, Ontario, and Canada, an NBA Championship. Kawhi Leonard did exactly what Toronto hoped he would do and that does deserve distinction.   On the other hand, he did hightail it back to SoCal the first chance he got in his NBA career at the expense of Toronto‚Äôs championship window. One could make an argument that he and Toronto are somewhat suffering now due to that decision. No doubt in my mind that if Kawhi had stayed in Toronto, Toronto would‚Äôve met LA in the Bubble Finals and they would still have something resembling a championship window.   I guess‚Ä¶ personally, I think number 2 should‚Äôve ran it back with Toronto for one more season before making the jump to the Clippers.  I guess the comparison that i would make to Kawhi‚Äôs accomplishment in Toronto is TB12‚Äôs accomplishment in TB; Tampa is going yo retire number 12 regardless of what Tom does going forward, so maybe out of respect for how gutsy a trade it was, and out of respect for how hard it is to win a championship, and out of respect for greatness and the game of basketball ‚Äî Kawhi‚Äôs number 2 should be retired in Toronto, especially considering how high a chance it is that his Toronto ring is probably the last ring he‚Äôs going to win as the undisputed number one option on the team."
"""My mom made it. OPAAAA!!!"" - Kawhi Leonard"
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
"you really think that jeanie buss and kawhi having a relationship is unrealistic?   I've done extensive research and deployed several spies in the internal camp of Kawhi Leonard, and my sources tell me that they are expecting a child in 3 months. If you don't believe me you're probably a sheep that's been brainwashed by the communist government.   ^(if you still haven't realized this whole post is a joke people are actually taking this seriously I thought i made it obvious enough but i guess not)"
"Mark my words, the Clippers will never win a championship with Kawhi Leonard."
"And Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Paul George, etc."
Assuming health and everyone wanting to participate   Steph curry  James Harden  Lebron Anthony Davis Kawhi Leonard   Are the biggest names missing
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.

Not to sound like a narc but who‚Äôs kawhi leonard?
Fuck Kawhi Leonard.
I'm unable to decide which unhealthy obsession the OP has more off: The Pistons or Kawhi Leonard
"Does it? I don't think it does because the previous story was kawhi was already calling other stars about teaming up in la/on the Clippers and we know he asked Durant as Durant himself said it. So he got turned down by his first few options then asked Paul George, which all lines up just fine as we KNOW he was asking stars to come team up already.  The idea Westbrook asked him first which caused him to ask Paul George seems like an inference on their part or entirely made up. He likely would have asked Paul George whether or not Westbrook asked him.  On top of that, Westbrook was being linked with harden on the Rockets already and they had discussed teaming up. For all we know these convos happen regularly and players bring up the idea of teaming up and talk about it. But the story is framed in a way that Westbrook asking Leonard then made him ask Paul George, which sounds silly and an assumption on the reporter's part as it stirs far more drama."
"Kawhi ""the most dangerous game"" Leonard"
How are you a spurs fan and don‚Äôt know the grudge pop has against the lakers. It‚Äôs well documented. He even tried to get the Pelicans to hold off the trade with AD. Google it. It‚Äôs not hard. It was well known the lakers were throwing the farm for Leonard and pop wanted nothing to do with it.   He didn‚Äôt want to give kawhi what he wanted and he wasn‚Äôt going to help the lakers pair bron and kawhi.   Demar is a known chocker in the playoffs use the word Star lightly. He‚Äôs a great player but definitely not someone who should be your number 1.   Pop could have groomed BI and Zo and had a plethora of picks and had a stable foundation for the future but now what do you guys have? Bunch of random players and no one good from that trade
"Because if you sign him this year you get him for not just this year but all the other years you sign him? He isn‚Äôt some bum that could be outta the league, it‚Äôs Kawhi fucking Leonard lmao."

The lakers absolutely were. The initial reported offer didn‚Äôt have all of the draft picks+ swaps in the AD deal but if Pop and the Spurs actually wanted to do a deal with the lakers they easily could‚Äôve asked for more draft compensation.

Free Agent Kawhi Leonard has signed for * *Cash Register noise* * sources tell The Athletic.
"There are tax treaties in place between the two countries that ensure that people who work cross-border aren't double-taxed.  I couldn't find the exact article I was reading back then, but [I did find one that says basically the same thing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/taxes/article-11-million-reasons-for-kawhi-leonard-to-stay-in-toronto/). It comes down to a provision in the CBA which allows a player to have part of their salary paid as a signing bonus, and with the provisions of the Canadian tax code, that portion of the salary is taxed at a much lower rate than it would be in California. For Kawhi's situation, his take-home pay would have been about $11M higher over 4 years if he played for the Raptors, despite the fact that the Raptors holding his Bird rights only allowed them to offer him $6M more in gross salary over the same term."
"[This isn't the one that I found back then, but it says the same thing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/taxes/article-11-million-reasons-for-kawhi-leonard-to-stay-in-toronto/).  Basically, there is a provision that allows you to have up to 15% of your salary paid as a signing bonus, which is taxed at only a 15% rate in Canada. With the overall math, even though Kawhi could get a larger salary in Toronto (since the Raptors had his Bird rights) with the proper structuring of the contract, the overall tax burden would be lower. The contract difference between the Raptors and Clippers was $6M (ie. the Raps could offer him that much more), but with the tax differential, Kawhi left $11M over 4 years on the table by going to the Clippers."
Ah the Vince Carter strategy to get traded by playing poorly until in the new team.  The Kawhi Leonard Process (tm) uses injury and lies to get you out of a team as well.  Let‚Äôs see what Simmons comes up with.
Because he would then be in line for the biggest contract in nba history next season. They will have his bird rights next year and can sign him to a 5 yr 257 (I think) million dollar contract. The clippers will give it to him regardless of injury history as it‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard
&gt;His last 2 teams showed no interest in retaining him but here come the Bulls running with a briefcase LOL  I mean the Spurs are trying to rebuild and the Raptors literally got Kawhi fucking Leonard from him in a trade
"&gt; I remember Jalen Rose speaking about how he had to pay extra because of playing in Canada, maybe it has changed but definitely our tax rate is higher no question about that.  Yes, no one is making the argument that the tax rate is not high in Canada, its high, but certain US states like New York and California (surprisingly the two I mentioned, get very close)  The thing you said was that players get taxed twice on games in Canada, they do not, any tax paid to the CRA gets deducted from their IRS bill.  &gt; Canadian federal and Ontario provincial tax rates presently sit at 53.5 per cent. U.S. federal tax rates are presently 37 per cent.  You're missing state income tax, California top bracket is 13.3%, which makes the total 50.3%, but there is also the Medicaid tax which is often forgotten which is 2.35%, the total is  52.65% which is very close to the Ontario tax rate.  &gt; Also listen to how Lowry talks about customs, every single time they leave and come back they have to spend a bunch of time going through border security. He said it's by far the most annoying thing he has to come across.  The fact that Lowry talks about customs more than the taxes should tell you how its not as big a deal as the media makes it out to be.  [Here's an article on which references a CPA around how much Kawhi would lose playing for the Raptors due to taxes](https://www.crowe.com/ca/crowesoberman/insights/kawhi-leonard-raptors-saga)  Some Excerpts  &gt; In the U.S., a Medicare tax of 2.35 percent is also added to your paycheque for another $893,000. (Medicare is an often-overlooked factor when it comes to comparing taxes for athletes on Canadian versus U.S. teams.) **Now take another look: the difference is much more palatable ‚Äìapproximately $300,000‚Äîa difference of less than 1 percent!**  &gt; As such, he‚Äôd be taxed there on his entire salary. And yes, he‚Äôd pay the CRA as well‚Äîbut they can only tax employment earnings for days worked in Canada. Using the 2018 calendar year as an example, the Raptors calculated that their players spent 66 percent of their working days in Canada. Thus, only two thirds of his salary would be taxable in Canada. Credits are available in the U.S. for taxes paid in Canada, **meaning effectively that a player pays the higher of either the Canadian tax rate or the U.S. tax rate on his working days in Canada.**   &gt; NBA rules also allow a player to earn up to 15 percent of his salary in the form of a signing bonus. As we‚Äôve noted before, signing bonuses get unique treatment under the Canada-U.S. income tax treaty. Pursuant to the treaty, Canada can only tax signing bonuses for an athlete like Kawhi at a maximum rate of 15 percent--an amount well lower than his U.S. tax rate. Thus, with careful contract structuring, it‚Äôs possible Kawhi could have $27M per year taxed in Canada at an effective rate of 45.3 percent, for a total tax obligation of $12.2M. Much lower than in California! While U.S. foreign tax credit computations are complicated and beyond the scope of this article, **it is not unreasonable to say that with thoughtful tax planning, Kawhi could structure his affairs in Canada so that he‚Äôs no worse off tax-wise playing for the Raptors than for a California team.**"
Toronto had DeRozan for 9 years and it took a trade for Kawhi Leonard to make that trade. The Spurs are obviously going young and rebuilding. Do you ever watch DeRozan play or just read stats. Have a look and appreciate was he does bring to the game rather than simply being a hater.
"What are his antics exactly? Not giving corny interviews or saying shit like being a ""Socialite""? People hate this guy because he doesn't give them any reason to write stories. Even this phone call thing is fucking stupid.  Westbrook: Hey let's fuck Paul George over and team up. Leonard: No I'm good, that's fucked up, I'm gonna let Paul know how you feel though. Westbrook: Pls no George: Thanks for letting me know Kawhi, fuck this backstabbing dude.  Y'all act like this dude manufactured a coup. He just let someone know his teammate was planning on fucking him over."

"Kuminga's ceiling is up there for sure (I think he's already got more tools than young Kawhi Leonard, who seemed super raw but took to the Spurs development program like a fish to water), but I'm still happy with the Giddey pick.  You can't really compare the two when it comes to athleticism--Kuminga blows Giddey out of the water--but Giddey truly does have that natural feel for basketball. Kuminga still has to learn how to read the game and make the right decisions in a flash, whereas you can watch any interview with Giddey and get the feeling that he doesn't just read the game well and react--Giddey knows how to manipulate the court and make things happen.  Kid's barely 18 and there's already interviews of him breaking down his own film and explaining how he made plays by watching the help defender's eyes (he was running a pick-and-roll on the wing and waited until the weakside corner's man took a step into the paint to make his one-handed pass to the split-second open weakside corner shooter) or by purposefully looking away from his target in order to draw the defense elsewhere (as his teammates ran an offball screen on the opposite wing, he stared daggers into the popping screener as if he was going to pass to the shooter, only to no-look-pass the ball into the paint to hit the cutter that was left open because his defender hedged onto the shooter Giddey was staring at).  We've had multiple picks where we chose the athletic prospect and hoped they would learn to feel the game out. I'm excited that we've got a prospect that already reads the game at a genuinely high level, and we just get to watch as he develops his jumpshot, his defense, and how to maximize his athleticism. More of a Luka/Paul Pierce/Middleton type, rather than a high-flyer, but that's totally fine when you have SGA slithering his way into the paint and Dort being a brick shithouse linebacker holding down the fort."

"2014 NBA finals game 5, one win away from ring number 5.   Spurs coming from down 15 and end going on a 39-15 run behind the shooting of Patty Mills, Kawhi Leonard, capped off by all time dunk by Manu on Chris Bosh.    It was the ultimate revenge tour.   https://youtu.be/i1ANov-Ogvg"
"I suspect he just finds the topic interesting and doesn't appreciate when the league office, among other interested parties, are spinning the numbers. It's not like he's a ""hater"" or a doomsayer:  &gt; Here‚Äôs the thing, though. The NBA is sort of back. These playoffs have been gloriously entertaining. That Bucks-Nets Game 7 should run on ESPN Classic. Trae Young might just be the charismatic superstar of the future. Giannis Antetokounmpo could be on his Hero‚Äôs Journey. The Suns are an aesthetically pleasing contender and the Kawhi Leonard-less Clippers are a captivating underdog. It‚Äôs been a good postseason. The NBA is making some positive strides, strides I‚Äôd be happier to discuss if Cuban and company weren‚Äôt spreading false narratives about their sport. The league doesn‚Äôt need to peddle ridiculous BS like implying that this is the most-watched playoffs in two decades. That notion is so divorced from reality that even Scott Foster could rule swiftly on it without the aid of slow-motion cameras."
I blame Kawhi Leonard for this thread.
Kawhi Leonard come to Hornets
Remember Chris Broussard followed and used RDA as a source for Kawhi Leonard?
Just like 2019 Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard are the best free agents remaining lol

"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain ‚Äì¬†including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 ‚Äì¬†all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year ‚Äì¬†and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
"Only someone without a modicum of basketball knowledge would claim market size has no effect on the appeal of a destination. Look at every recent superstar who caused drama to force their way off their team and see where they eventually wound up:  * Kawhi Leonard: Forced his way out of San Antonio, pit stop in Toronto, ended up in Los Angeles * Anthony Davis: Forced his way out of New Orleans, ended up in Los Angeles * Paul George: Forced his way out of Indiana, pit stop in Oklahoma, ended up in Los Angeles * Jimmy Butler: Forced his way out of Minnesota, pit stop in Philly, ended up in Miami * James Harden: Forced his way out of Houston, ended up in Brooklyn, NYC  So you mean to tell me it's a coincidence that every single superstar who demands out ends up in either a huge market or desirable destination (Miami weather)?  The Lakers couldn't get meetings with major free agents when they were dogshit. 80% of NBA teams can't even get meetings with major free agents when they're good. What a horrendous ""argument"".  &gt;iT's nOt AbOuT BeInG a bIg oR sMaLl mArKeT  If your theory is true, why isn't anyone clamoring to head to Utah, Milwaukee or Denver? Why didn't a star join Minnesota or Sacramento to put them over the top against the Lakers in early 2000's? Or join Indiana or Toronto to try to put them over the top against Lebron?  You're clearly a casual yourself, put that Lakers flair back up lol, you're not fooling anyone."
WTF is up with Kawhi Leonard?  Do any teams even have money to pay him now?
"It's funny how similar they are other than the size difference. They both complain, both take bad shots sometimes, both are incredible passers, and both draw a lot of fouls. Ofc, Trae makes his, that might be the biggest difference in his favor. But Trae cant post guys like Kawhi Leonard up either, though."
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
"Really not sure how you guys aren't getting this. The Pacers owned the pick. The pick was traded to San Antonio. Indiana then acts on behalf of San Antonio and selects who San Antonio wants. When it says ""Indiana selects Kawhi Leonard"" it's literally nothing more than a formality because of the leagues weird draft trade rules. If you still can't follow that, just go out and try to find pictures of Kawhi Leonard in a Pacers jersey."
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
"Anti-Nationalist*   Also, the Spurs drafted George Hill and then traded him to draft Kawhi Leonard. Both Americans."
This just in: Lakers and Clippers agree to a S&amp;T including Dennis Schroeder for Kawhi Leonard.
"I won't post the article because I believe in supporting good, non-clickbaity journalism like The Athletic (and because nobody would really read it all anyway), but I'll summarize for you:  1. A lot of what he's referring to with it being a bad deal is not just about the money DeRozan is getting paid, it's about what the Bulls gave up to get him. He makes the point that the Spurs got more from trading DeRozan after his contract ended than they did from trading Kawhi Leonard, which is pretty funny.  2. He does mention the money, saying some advanced metric said he's only worth about $16 million per year, but he takes a bigger issue with who exactly the Bulls were bidding against by offering him so much money. He said he didn't think the Spurs were gonna offer him anywhere near that much, the Thunder probably wouldn't have offered him anything, and nobody else had more than like $13 million in cap space. He felt like they probably could have got him on a significantly cheaper contract.  3. He makes the case that this off-season is basically as all in as the Bulls are capable of going, as they quite literally have no other picks they can trade until draft night of 2022 and 2024, and he feels like it's probably a mistake to be this pot committed to a team that most people feel is like the 6th seed in the East at best. Why fire all the bullets in your gun to top out at such a middle of the road team, guaranteeing you're just gonna be slightly better than average for the foreseeable future?"
Pop to DeRozan: You've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice and all those who have wronged me are on the Clippers. I will begin with Kawhi Leonard.
"2016 Spurs  PG: Tony Parker / Andre Miller / Patty Mills SG: Manu Ginobili / Kevin Martin / Danny Green SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kyle Anderson / Rasual Butler PF: LaMarcus Aldridge / David West / Boris Diaw C: Tim Duncan / Boban Marjanovic / Matt Bonner  That‚Äôs one multi-MVP all-timer (Duncan)  A multi-DPOY and FMVP who can score 27 ppg and is a top-3 player in the playoffs (Kawhi)  Three multi All-NBA players (Ginobili, Parker, LMA)  One two-time all-star (West)  Three borderline all-stars (Andre Miller, Kevin Martin and Boris Diaw all had seasons where they were close to that level)  Two exceptional 3-and-D wings (Anderson and Danny Green)  For my money, this legitimately might be the best one ever. A starting lineup of All-NBA players plus that depth off the bench is just staggering. The weakest position is center but Duncan played nearly 40 MPG back then and LMA and West would be capable of filling in those minutes as well."
"&gt; Yet the Clippers don't get nearly the amount of FAs as the Lakers  yeah they def didnt sign reigning finals mvp kawhi leonard recently, oh yeah and superstar paul george"

"Even if he shoot them efficiently, he's not good enough at it and other aspects of the game to compromise better players on your roster.

Plus nobody has given credit for the Spurs correctly diagnosing his injury and he was pissed as it wasn‚Äôt what he wanted to hear. I‚Äôm good.
"&gt; The Decision   Not talking about him signing with the Lakers. During The Decision, LeBron told the ew York Knicks, Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Clippers, and the Cavaliers that he was considering them for FA. These teams made offseason moves postured around acquiring LeBron. Dude then went on national TV and had an hour long special about how he was taking the Heat.

* PG: LeBron James * SG: Michael Jordan * SF: Kawhi Leonard * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Hakeem Olajuwon  You cannot score on this team. Michael Jordan defends the point of attack like he always did on the biggest stage. 6'6-7ft with DPOY potential on four positions and Durant is an elite defender as well.  KD and Kawhi provide spacing. Jordan is cutting defenses apart. LeBron bulldozers people and orchestrates the offense and Hakeem gets tons of easy baskets.   I don't know how this team loses.

"I understand what you‚Äôre saying but Jordan was actually insanely efficient. It‚Äôs actually kind-blowing he averaged higher than 60TS% while taking a ton of long 2s.  I think if he would have worked on his 3pt shot and used modern shot selection, MJ would be a much better version of Kawhi Leonard. There‚Äôs a lot of players from that era (such as Iverson or the million unathletic 7 footers) that would translate a lot worse."
My point is that Kareem was 38 years old at that time and he was capable of absolutely dominating a young Hakeem.  Now imagine him at his athletic prime.  If you're going off of one playoff run the Kawhi Leonard is better than Kobe lmao.
So by that logic Michael Jordan and Kawhi Leonard are ‚Äú‚Äùlow iq‚Äù players? Curious

You said ‚ÄúONLY trying to get to the free throw line‚Äù. Literal definition of an exaggeration. It‚Äôs also bad faith.   Anytime they shoot a 3 or go for a floater layup or lob they literally prove your generalization wrong.   And why‚Äôre you giving me a player comp fool? What does that prove? Kawhi Leonard watched film on Harden on how to get to the line too. So did Embiid.
What was the shot quality and how much defensive attention was he getting? Citing shot percentages alone paints a very small picture. The truth is that Dame gets much more defensive attention than PG13 and is forced to jack worse shots because he has less reliable teammates.   Put him on a team with Kawhi Leonard and see what happens

"If it helps, the players I've seen described this way are Keldon Johnson, Dillon Brooks, and Kawhi Leonard. Maybe Giannis too."
"In 2019 Kawhi Leonard put up 27 ppg during the regular season and then 30 ppg in the playoffs, while also playing suffocating defense on the other end. Kawhi ascended into a deadly scorer in the mid-range and very efficient from 3, but the latter part is the difference. It's extraordinary to have that much offensive *and* defensive talent in addition to the motor and stamina it takes to impact the game at all times. The only wing who has played that well on both ends of the floor in the regular season and playoffs is MJ. This 2021 playoffs he was shooting even better (30.4 pgg on .573/.393/.880 compared to 30.5 ppg on .490/.379/.884 in 2019 playoffs), while still anchoring a staunch defense. I understand Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the world ‚Äî I have had the pleasure of being alive at the same time that he has played basketball so I've gotten to watch his greatness ‚Äî but Kawhi's scoring efficiency has become rather comparable to KD's since 2019, and KD has never had a comparable impact on defense. I'll also add that Kawhi was super clutch in 2019, too, hitting extremely contested shots at the ends of games. I have no doubt that this year, if both teams were healthy, Clippers-Nets would've been our Finals matchup and it would've been a dogfight with LA's versatility versus BK's firepower."

Giannis is a power forward who often plays center. He is a big.  LeBron is straight up better than those guys. Forwards are inherently more valuable than guards because of their size and versatility. Great help defenders are also generally more valuable and harder to take out of the game than isolation specialists. LeBron is both. You might be able to entertain peak Artest vs. LeBron but his defensive prime was a flash in the pan compared to LeBron's.   Everything I said is reflected in postseason DRAPM which LeBron is #1 in since '98 among perimeter players. Here is what the rest of the list looks like.  Among qualifying players (2000+ MP):      1.

Tayshaun Prince (1.67)      9. Rajon Rondo (1.64)      10. Bruce Bowen (1.53)      11. Danny Green (1.50)      12. Mike Conley (1.40)      13. Dwyane Wade (1.37)      14. Luol Deng (1.25)      15. Metta World Peace (1.23)  Kawhi is basically an upgraded version of Jordan defensively and LeBron is ahead of him while playing with minimal rim protection most of his prime.
"Lots of hard question to answer because all three of those versions of pop had different players. You can't really isolate the coaching variable from the roster variable, having a prime Tim Duncan an emerging kawhi Leonard and then neither of the two leads the different expectations and you can't really compare apples to apples"
Still more than Kawhi Leonard
1. Michael Jordan  2. Gary Payton  3. Scottie Pippen  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Tony Allen

"This subreddit just hates Kawhi Leonard. The man had an all time great playoff run just 2 years ago in 2019 and even this past playoffs the man put up 30/7/4 on 57/39/88 while playing great defense.  Kawhi is an all-time great playoff performer and is definitely comparable to a guy like lebron at his peak. He just lacks the longevity. His 2017, 2019 and 2021 playoff numbers are absolutely bonkers.   People just love to harp on the 3-1 choke over and over. Kawhi has 4 major fanbases that hate him: raptors fans, lebron fans, Spurs fans and laker fans.   It will probably take him winning another ring to shut these people up for good."
"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
"Guys stop downvoting him, this his guy didn‚Äôt hear about Kawhi Leonard until that shot‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt know!"
Kawhi Leonard 0/0/0 on 0/0/0 splits
"Giannis, KD, and LeBron are the clear cut top 3. But when you compare Kawhi to Steph for the 4 spot, it really depends on what niche you need.   Is your team solid on defense but lacking 3 pt scoring (Sixers)? Steph Curry Does your team lack a clutch 2-way forward (Raptors, Knicks, Warriors, Suns)?: Kawhi Leonard Does your team need a playmaking leader and elite scorer (Celtics, Raptors, Knicks)?: James Harden"
Kawhi Leonard is up there too. He‚Äôs a top three postseason performer in the league *at least.*
"Luka nearly beat (arguably) the best team in the nba when healthy on his fucking own, being guarded by Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and you think he isn't top 10"
&gt; the same fans who were against the Kawaii trade that are now against this Simmons trade.   Yes I can see how Ben ‚Äúalmost DPOY‚Äù Simmons is basically exactly like trading for 2014 Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard‚Ä¶
Im going Steven Adams with Kawhi Leonard second because of how sneaky he is
"Regular season games missed in the last five years and respective ages:  * Anthony Davis - 83 games missed, 28 years old  * Kawhi Leonard - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * Steph Curry - 115 games missed, 34 years old  * Joel Embiid - 131 games missed , 27 years old  * Kevin Durant - 147 games missed, 33 years old"
NBA comps have been so lazy for so long lol it‚Äôs really just a body type comp. In the 2019 draft like 14 players were Kawhi Leonard comps lol
"He didn‚Äôt get saved by shit, he wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad of a playoff performer as r/nba thinks. Deroxan was. No one gets saved, so many HOF players have never even made it to the finals, he got owned by Lebron... everyone did. He still made ECF 3 years in a row? He was the most successful eastern conference player besides the cavs? How is that some playoff failure. He lead the team to a first place finish in the east. He‚Äôs a hall of fame player who won a championship once Kawhi came. The Raptors needed Lowry to win second to Kawhi and Lowry helped Leonard be the drone he is to just play while Lowry cultivated the culture of a championship team and was a leader. Hating ass post who knows nothing about the Raptors"
"Easily the worst shit about their dynamic. ESPN transformed from first take to ‚ÄúStephen A &amp; friends harass Max for 2 hours.‚Äù  And my god the hypocrisy. SAS wouldn‚Äôt get off Max‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard take for 2 years, yet SAS was the one that had like what 6 finals in a row where he picked the wrong team lmao that‚Äôs not even going into his other bs like the whole ‚Äúlebron wants to kick kyries ass‚Äù rumor he spread, yet couldnt take accountability for."
"Timmy also had David Robinson who switched off to Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, and Kawhi Leonard for his entire career  Lebron is 4-1 in finals where he had a legitimate chance to win  Tim Duncan didn't end the Kobe and Shaq Lakers lol they imploded on themselves. If anything, the Pistons deserve the credit for ending them considering the very next year after Duncan won the Lakers steamrolled the Spurs to head to the finals  Also Duncan didn't end the Heat dynasty. Wade becoming washed ended them. Duncan wasn't even the best player on the court for the 2014 finals"
"&gt;In the most ideal scenario, Leonard could return to practice around March-April.  Playoffs start in April 16th. Yes he can recover faster than most ideal scenario. But as this tweet says Clippers will need to progress few rounds if we will want to see Kawhi. Maybe in WC finals against Mavs. :)"
"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer‚Äôs newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons‚Äô availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly ‚Äî and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season‚Äôs $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  ¬ª READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons‚Äô absence: It‚Äôs ‚Äòborderline kind of disrespectful‚Äô  The Sixers‚Äô position that they‚Äôre not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They‚Äôre trying to win a championship, and believe they‚Äôre in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who‚Äôs in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren‚Äôt as blindsided by Simmons‚Äô desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons‚Äô trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons‚Äô camp don‚Äôt believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they‚Äôre just determined to do it on their terms. Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta. Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta.YONG KIM / Staff Photographer Destined for a messy divorce  Publicly, the Sixers talk about wanting Simmons to return and be part of a championship team in Philly. The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has ‚Äúrun its course.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThey know that,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been known that. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He‚Äôs going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.‚Äù Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can‚Äôt blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can‚Äôt blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt negate that the relationship is done,‚Äù another source said. ‚ÄúThis is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That‚Äôs what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it‚Äôs not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.‚Äù  ¬ª READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers‚Äô starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers‚Äô tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons‚Äô skills was more lovely, it‚Äôs hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers‚Äô lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly‚Äôs steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn‚Äôt honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  ‚ÄúThis entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It‚Äôs not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs never been smooth at all.‚Äù  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player‚Äôs former team got worse. That‚Äôs something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid‚Äôs squad, not Simmons‚Äô team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team‚Äôs go-to player.  ‚ÄúWhat No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?‚Äù said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just [speaking] facts. But because he‚Äôs Australian, because he‚Äôs a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.‚Äù"
kawhi leonard was me....except i'm not a pro.
"If we are talking about chips , you refuse to take into account level of competition . LeBron had harder competition   San Antonio Spurs with Greg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kawhi Leonard. There's 5 hall of famers right there and LeBron had to face them 3 times. The first year, he had Boobie Gibson as his second best player haha. Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant (for 2 years). LeBron had to face them 4 times. The first year he lost Kyrie and Love for the whole series. The second year, Warriors went 73-9 (all-time record) and was down 3-1 for the biggest comeback in the history of sports. Third and fourth year, that 73-9 team added Kevin Durant. One of those years, he had to face the Thunder that had Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka and then the only team he was favored to beat that he lost to, was Dallas Mavericks, who collectively outperformed the predictions by beating Portland, sweeping past champion Lakers, and beating OKC who had Durant, Westbrook, Harden."

The Kawhi Leonard stealing the ball from Simmons clip that was posted a little while back was some alpha dog shit.
I honestly think PG is a better number one option than the second star guy on a team. But he has no choice on the Clippers. Kawhi Leonard is the better player.
"*Ben Simmons pulls out the Kawhi Leonard card*  ""I'm injured. I don't feel 100%."""
Lol players play with lingering injuries literally every game.  Were you under the impression that Kawhi Leonard is 100% free of a degenerative hamstring injury because he shows up and plays at a high level?  &gt; Myocarditis  You mean the same Myocarditis that you are far more likely to get from COVID?    https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133462-800-myocarditis-is-more-common-after-covid-19-infection-than-vaccination/  But hey glad to see you are an anti vaxxer that makes it much easier to literally dismiss everything else you are about to reply with.
Kawhi Leonard type beat
"We also have no clue how Duncan would've navigated an unstable situation.  He was drafted to the best coach, the best GM, and the best locker room.  Granted, a lot of that is a credit to his leadership, but he didn't make the scouting department find Manu and Parker, or trade George Hill for Kawhi Leonard.  Kobe dealt with a litany of bad leadership for the majority of his career."
"give kobe fuckin Parker, Manu, AND 23  YEAR OLD KAWHI LEONARD in his twilight years &amp;im sure he'd be way more ""impactful"" in your eyes lmao. no shit Duncan was useful he didn't have to do nearly as much. Duncan also wasn't the best player on those 2 finals in 2013 and 2014.   again, Duncan had 3 hall of fame teammates in his last 5 or 6 years. kobe had fuckin who exactly? Chris Kaman? Robert sacre?"
"Is Kawhi Leonard the leader of his teams? I don‚Äôt really see it like that. He‚Äôs always had Tim, Pop, Lowry, and even Pat Bev was probably a more vocal leader than him."
2003 was half luck half genius by management to find diamond in the rough players like Parker and Manu so late in the draft.  2012-2017 was possible as they were already consistently contending off the backs of TD/Parker/Manu were the 1st seed coming into the lockout season and were able to trade George Hill for Indiana's 15th pick which would later become Kawhi Leonard. Not many players like that get picked that late either.
"Man, it's too funny how people act about that series.  The Spurs were spanking the Warriors through 2 and half quarters in game 1 and Kawhi was going off despite *already playing on a bad ankle.*  People seem to forget but Kawhi had already had a really bad ankle sprain just before this series. It was so bad he had to sit game the Spurs/Houston elimination game 6.   https://youtu.be/wCR9ftSe4Js  [This article shows the roll, it's bad.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/spurs-rockets-kawhi-leonard-rolls-ankle-in-game-5-sits-out-final-play-of-regulation-ot/)  They gave Kawhi as much treatment as they could but it was very vulnerable. Another moment a lot of people forget about is when Kawhi rolled that same ankle on his own teammate's foot not too long before the play with Zaza happened.   While I really cannot find footage of this anywhere, it's like it has been scrubbed from the internet, it was Kawhi's own teammate who played a role in re-injuring Kawhi's ankle. Kawhi stepped on David Lee's foot and went down with the ankle buckling.  Finally if you go look at the final play to put Kawhi done for good there is literally at most 1"" of overlap between Kawhi's foot and Zaza's.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/5/14/15638440/kawhi-leonard-injury-ankle-injured-zaza-pachulia-spurs-warriors  Look at the pics, it's the edge of Kawhi's shoe landing on the edge of Zaza's.   I don't know what was going on inside Zaza's head on that play but Kawhi's ankle was already in really bad shape. To try and put it all on Zaza, or to go further and say the Spurs definitely would have won that series if Kawhi didn't go down, is way beyond reasonable."
"I'm replying to this:  &gt;  it has been always an obvious choice to accept a max extension.  As I understand it, the extension rules for non-rookie contracts before the most recent CBA meant that max level players would earn more getting an entirely new contract (in free agency), than by extending on their previous contract. I think the difference is that now max players can get 8% annual raises by sticking with the same team in an extension, which is better than a free agent contract with a new team.  Therefore, it would have been a bad business decision for Durant to extend with the Thunder, even if he wanted to return to the team, because he'd have been leaving money on the table.  A good counter-example to this is what Kawhi Leonard did this off-season: he signed a contract long enough that he'll be able to re-negotiate and extend 2 years before it finishes, and get max money locked in for what would essentially become a 7-year contract. Recent top level player movement has all been via trade, and a big reason for that is that players can earn more by keeping their current contract and extending with the next team."
"That pick turned into Jakob Poeltl, who then became part of the trade for Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard."
"23 minutes into the video, they are talking about teammates you don't vibe with and he names the first initial situation that made him make up his mind about Philly and there were only 4 players in that meeting: Jimmy, JJ, Embiid, Simmons. Jimmy states that the work ethic in the meeting is what made him know he was done with the organization, after only being on the team for only 2-3 weeks. And we all know now who the culprit is when it comes to horrible work ethic. It's pretty obvious when multiple name brand NBA personnel that you definitely know are serious about the game points fingers at somebody then it's not coincidence. He then follows up with him knowing after the Kawhi Leonard shot that he knew that Philly wasn't a workable situation because the only way they could be contenders was if they changed the culture. Ben Simmons was the culture and they definitely weren't going to move on from him.    https://youtu.be/HrGv50kR7A4"
You legit made me LOL. I can imagine this with Kawhi Leonard having no reaction to any of it.
I remember Manu and Tony saying something similar to this about Kawhi (i.e. we are just focused on the players that are here) and /r/nba shit all over them and said they were being disrespectful to Leonard.  Guess we'll see what's changed over the last 2 years.
"Kawhi Leonard hit an all-time backbreaker shot to send our best team in years home and I could give a fuck about him or Toronto, but somehow Raptors fans to this day are in every Sixers thread talking the most shit."
TIL Marcus Morris is Kawhi Leonard.

It would be funny, but it won't happen. It's not even shooting yourself in the foot, it's like shooting both of your legs and arms off because some 20 year old is being moody  **and to add on to that** a contract is for the hope that they will be able to produce, if you're a good enough player you have more leniance for these types of sheningans because you're saught after, just the fact that he's a top3 defender and a 6'11"" gaurd means he will always have a high value.  There's no guarantee for anything, as the President he's got to deal with the situation that he needs to trade a player who is fine with tanking his value.  This issue also isn't all on Ben, Doc Rivers was garbage and publically threw a player under the bus, that essentially never happens. Doc Rivers is a poor playoff coach and always deflects his shortcomings, he shit on PG13 and Ty Lue then they made the Conference finals without him despite Kawhi Leonard being out."

"I think so. People constantly bring up that he was #2 in DPOY voting but what does that matter? I'd rather have Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, or AD on defense instead of him. Ben Simmons is obviously a great defender but he is not a top 5 defender."
"Brandon Knight, Jabari Parker, Kawhi Leonard (I got one right), Trey Burke, Patrick Young (played college ball in Florida), Thomas Robinson... The list could go on."
You guys think my list is valid? 1) serge ibaka  2) kelly oubre  3) paul george  4) jayson tatum  5) gordon hayward  6) Sga  7) Kawhi leonard  8) zach lavine  9) dillon ‚Äúchad‚Äù brooks  10) kyrie irving

"Took me a quick 10 second google search to find a [Kawhi Leonard comp](https://nbadraftroom.com/p/patrick-williams/). I don't know why it's so unbelievable when scouts and ""analysts"" always throw hyperbolic comparisons at the wall and see which one sticks."

"Simple fix,  If a player refuses to to play, due to non-medical reasons and isn't excused from the Team you have 4 phases:  **3 Days AWOL** \- Team begins fining players  **7 Days AWOL** \- Teams can move them to Commissioners Exempt List, which requires a 30 day stay(Date is retroactive from the 1s Day AWOL) minimum.  Players will report directly to the league office regarding their status, location, medical situation, etc at that point. Players agree their reports will be available to ALL league personnel who inquires about their status at that point.  Players are required to report to the league office their status weekly.  Players are required to undergo a physical exam, every 30 days being on the commissioner exempt lists. Players will be paid 65% of the their base salary, plus any fines leveled by the team.  Physical examination, and weekly status reports are requirements to continue to be paid.  Players on the exempt list at the Commissioners discretion will be advised on their availability to media and attendance to NBA Events (so you can't sit attend NBA games while on the list for instance).  The player can be replaced on their roster but their salary still counts against the cap in full at this point. (This allows the league to step in on toxic situations and allows teams to have full status of players).    **30 Days AWOL** \- Teams can move to terminate the player's contract.  Players on the Commissioners Exempt Lists can request arbitration, if termination is sought. Once arbitration starts, a player can't be traded or cut. Players can not move to a new team until arbitration is completed, and ineligible for NBA competition 180 days from original AWOL Date. (This is basically both parties have agreed its best everyone moves on).  Teams can be compensated in the form of cash, trade exemptions, and draft picks (non-lottery). (Zion Williamson Rule, Zion wants out fine, New Orleans gets a $15M trade exemption)  Players signed due to being on Commissioners Exempt Lists can sign with a new team, for league minimum, HOWEVER their salary cap value will be assigned based on the previous played 82 Games Metrics, and league awards earned the previous 3 seasons. Players are ineligible for NBA competition for 180 days from AWOL Date.   The Commissioner can add players to the list at the player's request.  So an example James Harden wanted out of Houston, the next team still pays him $1.3M for the minimum, but his Salary Cap Value is $38M, so the next team still has to gut their roster to get him.  **60 Days+ AWOL** \- Players on Commissioner's list will be paid 50% of base salary, and continue to report to  The League Office. During this time, players can be traded, or waived. If player under contract is on the The List when their contract expires. The player is ineligible for NBA competition for 180 days from the start of their next contract.  Mean signing in July not eligible until after New Years.  Players not on the List will get issued a full release from their contract, and stop being fined.  The player will be ineligible for NBA competition for a full calendar year retroactively. (Kawhi Leonard Rule)  Commissioner can remove a player from The List at their discretion.  So basically, if player wants out of a situation, they have to forgo salary for a year.  Yes, players could collude to end up in their chosen destination, but they would do so with a year lay-off.  If a franchise wants to take that chance, thats on them."
"I think Kawhi Leonard is going to be pretty difficult to rank all-time for some, there's the load management, he's never going to be in the MVP conversation again because of that load management, the defensive players of the year do help a lot though, He's Just Not That regular-season player, then you look at his run in San Antonio where he was primarily a defensive specialist and he gets a finals MVP, although it's one of the least impressive finals MVPs of all times when it comes to statistics, then he spends a year in Toronto win the championship in spectacular fashion even with the Warriors injuries, but then you just have to look at the fact that his time with the Clippers has been a bust so far ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, the injuries have cost him so much time and he'll probably be out all of next year so it's tough to say"
Kawhi Leonard has been a top 5 playoff performer of the last 10 years.
"Kawhi Leonard, Harden tried to, Jimmy?"
"Sure, which is why I couched my comment with ‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to say what the Lakers offered.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not saying one way or another. I was just offering clarification on what the previous poster was saying based off of the rumors being reported at the time.  See:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dslvsk/gregg_popovichs_refusal_to_trade_kawhi_to_the/  https://news4sanantonio.com/sports/spurs-zone/spurs-reportedly-would-not-trade-kawhi-leonard-to-lakers-no-matter-what  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2771868-kawhi-leonard-trade-rumors-gregg-popovich-rule-is-not-to-help-teams-like-lakers  No one knows what the Lakers offered besides the Lakers and Spurs. And no one knows why Pop went with the Toronto offer instead, besides Pop and the Spurs."
It‚Äôs true tho he just can‚Äôt. He‚Äôs a regular season try hard who can‚Äôt actually impact offensive players when it matters. Kawhi leonard and even trae young were totally unbothered by him.
Love Kawhi Leonard regardless of him giving my mavs too many first round exits.
"Blow. It. Up. The Raptors are kind of in a weird spot. I don't see a realistic scenario where they can become a legit contender in the next few years. Lowry is 35 which doesn't making a dinosaur or anything but he's probably got only a few really productive years left. Pascal Siakam and Fred Van Vleet are both 27 years old. So you got one of your core players aging out soon and two that are just about to get into their primes.  You don't win an NBA championship without a Hall of Fame player. Even the Detroit Pistons, a team that gets talked about a lot as a championship team without a real star, has Hall of famer Ben Wallace. Although Dirk Nowitzki was a clear hall of famer by the time he won his championship nobody would have said that that team was loaded.   So how are the raptors going to get this Hall of Fame type player? It's highly unlikely that they're going to find one via trade like they did with Kawhi Leonard. That was a unique circumstance. I don't think anybody expects Siakam, Van Vleet, or OG Ananouby to become that type of player. You still have time to build something around these guys but at best it's a middling playoff team.   I know Masai has no desire to go through a full rebuild but I just don't see how can get around it at this point. He should see we can get for these younger guys except, Ananouby, let Lowry walk, and just tank for the next few years and hope you get lucky in the lottery."
&gt;Success  Kawhi leonard..  and outside of Kawhi what success do Lowry and Vanvleet have?
"I'm not convinced Kawhi is a first option guy himself.  There's an argument to be made that he's a role player, just that his role is to score.  On the Spurs he wasn't the team leader nor was he on Toronto.  The first time he's supposed to be the team leader it was a failure.  It kind of depends on the nuances between team leader and first option, I suppose but it's not cut &amp; dried that Leonard can carry a team as the top guy even if he is the leading scorer."
kawhi leonard also has two first names
Kawhi Leonard? No
both teams had Paul George and Kawhi Leonard at some point too... coincidence???!?!?
"The shots that have completely vanished since the 90s are mostly still jump shots, they're just the inefficient ones.   Nobody spots up inside the 3-point line, nobody runs plays to generate baseline jumpers on the sides of the key, and unless you're Kawhi Leonard or DeMar DeRozan, you probably don't take long 2s off the dribble.   Post-ups are down overall, but they're far from dead. Joel Embiid was automatic facing up in the post for this entire season; teams just aren't (or shouldn't be) wasting touches on post possessions for guys like Drummond, or like when Dwight Howard was in Charlotte and Atlanta."
Put Kawhi Leonard on him from the first game instead of dicking around and putting Marcus Morris on him for long stretches like he‚Äôs done in the past. Don‚Äôt have to put Kawhi on him every play of the series and obviously there‚Äôs Paul George but at some point if you really believe this just put your best defender on him to start to set the tone early. Kawhi‚Äôs offense isn‚Äôt going to fall apart because you put him on Luka Doncic for a game to start the series.   Regardless of whether you put PG or Kawhi on him put your best options on him. So much of Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris vs Doncic last year
Kevin Durant when not surrounded by the core of a team that went 67-15 and 73-9 in back to back seasons was not a better postseason performer than Kawhi Leonard lol.
Maybe but if you‚Äôre facing the clippers for example giving up long 2s to Kawhi Leonard is bad strategy. In the playoffs you‚Äôre facing the 1% of teams that have guys who can make shots that most teams cant
LeBron James- 2016: This put him in the GOAT conversation   Stephen Curry- 2015: Followed up a dominant MVP season and proved himself   Kevin Durant- 2018: Going back-to-back in FMVP put him in a very exclusive category   Kawhi Leonard- 2019: One of the most dominant 2-way championship runs
Dude it's a joke about Kawhi Leonard. Everyone is so fucking serious. I guess the /s is required since everyone on this forum is so dense.

"The MVP is so narrative-based that I really view it as more of a check box on the resume than something where counting them really makes sense.  Historically, every player who has won an MVP is in the Hall of Fame or will be when they are eligible (except for Derrick Rose), so while having one is definitely an important part of a player's legacy, the overall total is less important.  A more personal gripe of mine is that I don't feel that a regular season-only award is really the best way for the NBA to be going about their MVP.  Let's face it:  More than half of the league makes the playoffs, so I can't really think of many situations where you could make a case for an MVP from a non-playoff team.  if you take the playoffs into account, I think you end up with a more representative award of that season.  2019 is a great example.  Giannis won the MVP award that year, but when I (and I'm guessing most NBA fans) think of the best/most impactful/most valuable/whatever your definition of MVP is player from that season, we think of Kawhi Leonard first, and probably rightfully so."

I remember talking about the wiz around New Years and talking about how weird it was that we now have Russ but he...doesn‚Äôt go to the hoop ...at all. Such a clear difference. Also your username man...without hindsight I wanted kawhi Leonard at that pick....
I made one on another topic a few days ago when someone was outraged that Wade is not universally acknowledged as a top20 all-time player.  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Karl Malone * Jerry West * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Charles Barkley * Kawhi Leonard * Scottie Pippen * James Harden * Elgin Baylor * Isiah Thomas * David Robinson * Chris Paul  That's a quick and dirty top30. Who does Westbrook replace?
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron‚Äôs effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie‚Äôs exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron‚Äôs people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA‚Äôs other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn‚Äôt pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
"&gt; Efficiency is not the end all be all.  A good scorer is an efficient scorer at volume. That‚Äôs literally what should be the definition.  You are not wasting needless possessions that could otherwise be given to teammates scoring on higher efficiency. It‚Äôs simple basic mathematics and that is why the league has been trending the way it has been - because Volume scoring at low efficiency loses games, aka bad scoring.  The scoring list is a matter of being first option, longevity and volume, nothing more. Not a single GM doesn‚Äôt pick Kawhi Leonard over Russell Westbrook all time as a first option scorer despite one not sniffing the scoring list because of his efficiency.  I‚Äôm a fan of Westbrook. But he just is not one of the best scorers of all time."
Also TLDR: Kawhi Leonard needs to shoot 46/46 from the free throw line and Stephen Curry needs to shoot 45/45 from the field to get to 50/40/90
Kawhi Leonard.
If we're judging based on the games they've played while actually healthy I think you can even make a strong case that he's been better than Kawhi this year. I won't dismiss anybody who insists on putting Leonard above him but I truly don't think it's outrageous to have Russ as a top 9 player this year
"I think Tim Duncan is a top 10 player of all time but putting him in the Top 5 is overrating him. Some of those All-nba he got towards the end was when the center position was incredibly weak and he wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. Both of his MVPs where extremely close and he probably should only have won one. Best winrate in the NBA probably has more to do with the fact that he was always surrounded with a good team. What happened after duncan retired? the spurs won 61, 47(kawhi missed the first 27 games), 48 (no Dejounte Murray) games right around 50ish games each season, probably has more to do with pop being a great coach then it does with duncan. Duncan is also the only NBA center to fail to win an Olympic Gold medal -- and the 2004 Team USA he captained was a complete embarrassment, somehow getting blown out by Puerto Rico, which is obviously a US territory. I find Duncan to be overrated on the defensive end, often times he wasn't even the best defender on his own team. He only occasionally was the leading vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners, and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"Kawhi Leonard... I don‚Äôt like he handled the situation in San Antonio. I understand that I don‚Äôt have the best perspective on what happened but it still rubs me the wrong way. Plus, he plays in LA"
Fuck Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi had a great finals, but he had a lot of help during the series and leading up to it. Lowry and Siakam in particular both played some amazing basketball, and both posted double doubles while out scoring Leonard in the game clincher. Leonard wasn‚Äôt the only All Star-caliber player on that team, but it seems like you‚Äôre pretending he was. ‚ÄúLed‚Äù a team to a championship? Absolutely. ‚ÄúCarried‚Äù a team to a championship? Nah.   And to answer your question: to me? Yes. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you‚Äôre asking the wrong guy if you thought I was going to say no. üòÇ"
"&gt;I'll grant that the Lakers and Knicks get a lot of attention relative to talent level in any given year, but I'm not sure how relevant that is considering how bad that attention can be if the team isn't good (look at how the Knicks are typically covered).  The fact that fans of small market teams have to hear about the Lakers and Knicks nonstop when they're not even good is a huge part of the problem.   &gt;The Clippers have only had one major free agent signing in franchise history (Kawhi Leonard) and it took all of their draft picks plus two players to make it happen.   Oh so the Clippers were only able to sign *one* of the premier free agents of the last 10 or so years, and it came at the steep cost of acquiring another perennial All-NBA player who specifically wanted to play for the Clippers, and so that means big markets don't have an advantage. Also you can't just pretend that players requesting trades almost solely to big markets isn't a thing. Weird that when CP3 got traded in 2011 it wasn't to the Grizzlies or Hawks or Pacers, it was to the Lakers oops I mean the Clippers  &gt;but if Memphis had KD, Kyrie, and Harden they would too.  Memphis never gets Kyrie, KD, and Harden level players all at once without drafting at least two of them that's the entire point lmao. Going to Memphis or some other small market team never even crossed their mind. It's only ever going to be a handful of teams in consideration when this level of FA hits the market and actually changes teams.  &gt;I think that people overstate the impact of a large market. There are a few exceptions, but the fact that the Bulls don't get much coverage or big free agent signings seems to support the idea that big market teams don't have significant built-in advantages.  My post addressed this. The Bulls are a big market, just not at a Lakers or Knicks level where they'll get FA/disgruntled star attention and media coverage regardless of how well they're doing. They've been very poorly managed since Rose's ACL, but if they were even remotely decent they'd be at least be players for big FA, just like they've always been even if they're not always landing the big fish.  Your logic is like saying ""well I know this guy who grew up in an upper-middle class family but now he's a recovering drug addict working at an Arby's, doesn't really support the idea that growing up with money correlates with success and happiness huh""."
"How are we defining large markets? Everywhere I look consider both the Bay Area and Chicago to be pretty large markets. I'll grant that the Lakers and Knicks get a lot of attention relative to talent level in any given year, but I'm not sure how relevant that is considering how bad that attention can be if the team isn't good (look at how the Knicks are typically covered). The Clippers have only had one major free agent signing in franchise history (Kawhi Leonard) and it took all of their draft picks plus two players to make it happen. It's true that the clippers, nets, &amp; Celtics are getting attention now because of their stars but if Memphis had KD, Kyrie, and Harden they would too. I think that people overstate the impact of a large market. There are a few exceptions, but the fact that the Bulls don't get much coverage or big free agent signings seems to support the idea that big market teams don't have significant built-in advantages."
"People keep saying it would do nothing for his legacy and perception; that his ring would be as meaningless as those championships won by Durant with the warriors. The former is wrong, and the latter has some truth to it. People generally regard the three best players of the last decade to be Lebron, Curry, and Durant. All three have won multiple championships and MVPs. Excluded are players like Harden, who does have an MVP but no championships, and Kawhi Leonard, who has multiple championships but no MVP. Would we still regard KD to be top 3 without those championships? Hell no. He'd have the same reputation as Harden. So Durant's supposedly meaningless championships solidified his place as one of the greatest 3 players of the last decade. I think this championship would do roughly the same thing for Harden. Everyone knows he's good enough to win as the first option, so it doesn't really matter how ""earned"" his ring is. He'll just have to deal with the same hate KD does, but he doesn't seem to be the type to care."
"that's totally unrealistic, how about CJ for Kawhi Leonard, that makes much more sense for both sides... /s"
"I guess you could get a sign-and-trade or pull a 2019 raptors and trade for an expiring superstar with no promise of retaining him.   I don't know if the numbers work but if you leave out point guards that would mean Leonard (lol), Beal, Durant, or Harden. Out of those Beal is the only one that seems at least reasonable. Maaaybe Kawhi if things really go south but I doubt it"
If Kawhi makes it you can sub him in for steph and still have the warriors run covered between Leonard and lebron.  We also don't need Dirk or Shaq on this list between Wade and Kobe fwiw.
Do teams really retire guys after forcing a trade out and quitting on the team like Harden did to Houston? Also where are they retiring Kawhi Leonard?
Kawhi Leonard come on down  Dame + Randle isn't winning anything but... we have the most cap space in the league + a fuck ton of assets + a better supporting cast already than the Blazers do
"ah i guess the first result i got when i searched lillard's contract lied, yep he's not a free agent but kawhi can be, so kawhi leonard it is then"
"Scratch Kawhi Leonard, we have a shot at Lillard, we just need to trade anyone that's not named LeBron James or Anthony Davis"
Trying to make play to triple team Kawhi Leonard in the  paint leaving two open at the perimeter. On a fast break. LeBron stopped at the top when Talen left to help. Both led to an easy point. It's the same thing lmao.  Both avoidable
"Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, and most recent superstars played majority of their careers in the West.    if LeBron didn‚Äôt play in the weak East his whole career, he would not be considered as high as he is."
"Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, and most recent superstars played majority of their careers in the West.    if LeBron didn‚Äôt play in the weak East his whole career, he would not be considered as high as he is."
You‚Äôve never seen a player get this many excuses? Have you heard of Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry?
"There are more to games than points scored. And it's not as simple as more points = better player. He's being used as a decoy for better or worse. He's being pushed to the corner and Kawhi Leonard and/or Paul George are always guarding him. Meaning he's taking one of the league's best defenders completely out of the picture.   Luka now is able to pick out his matchups and not worry about both PG and Kawhi being switched onto him. With KP drawing their two best defenders out to the perimeter, it gives Luka huge lanes to drive, if they collapse, he throws it to KP who is shooting 38% from 3 this series, and 37% on the year on high volume. The Clippers strategy has been to force Luka to score/create and to limit Porzi≈Üƒ£is and THJ's impact, so far it's given them mixed results as Luka's been able to dominate.   I don't love how he's being used, but it's yielding results so far, we are up 3-2 against the team most had predicted to sweep us and win the Western conference. The Mavs have played better with Porzi≈Üƒ£is on the floor than with him off. It would be nice if he was scoring more, but that's not what is being asked of him. He's playing the same role as THJ/DFS/Maxi in that he's creating space for Luka to work. I guess he could force more shots or have more plays drawn up for him, but so far we are winning. Why force more shots for Porzi≈Üƒ£is when his current role has us up 3-2.   He's shooting 47/38/80 in the series, so it's not like he's missing the shots he's getting, he's just not getting as many shots because he's being guarded tightly by a DPOY and/or an all defensive level guy in PG and the Clippers defensive strategy is to switch on Luka and keep a top defender on Porzi≈Üƒ£is at all times. Why would the Mavs force a Porzi≈Üƒ£is shot while he's guarded by Kawhi Leonard, when the Clippers are willingly switching slow-ass Zubac or tiny Reggie/Beverly onto Luka. One is a difficult shot regardless of who is shooting, and one is BBQ chicken."
Odds for Rich Paul's first call after this game:   Damian Lillard - $1.01  Kawhi Leonard - $1.45  Chris Paul - $1.88  Jimmy Butler - $2.22
Love how you conveniently leave out Finals MVP Kawhi fucking Leonard lmao.  Smh
"Always been hated.   I was watching the Dodgers in the 2014 season and when they showed the Clippers being eliminated the entire crowd of 50,000 erupted in cheers.   A few years earlier, they showed Doc, DeAndre and CP on the video board during a game and the entire crowd booed them. That one was extra funny cus they were actually in attendance lol.   https://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles/clippers/post/_/id/6340/cp3-expected-boos-from-dodgers-fans  https://www.google.com/amp/s/losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/09/30/kawhi-leonard-rams-fans-clippers-booed/amp/  They don't belong here. No one likes them, no one wants them. Los Angeles doesn't need nor want two basketball teams."
kawhi Leonard is going to Golden State. You heard it first. Lillard is going to the Lakers.
"West champions since Jordan left the Bulls:  Spurs, Lakers, Lakers, Lakers, Spurs, Lakers, Spurs, Mavericks, Spurs, Lakers, Lakers, Lakers, Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs, Spurs, Warriors, Warriors, Warriors, Warriors, Warriors, Lakers, ???  Notable players for these teams include Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Anthony Davis."
"It‚Äôs the difference between being able to sign Kawhi Leonard while keeping Nunn and Robinson (an attractive situation for Kawhi to go to) and needing to trade everyone on the roster, including Herro, except Bam/Jimmy, to be able to afford Kawhi (a not so attractive situation).  Alternatively it would have let them bring in Kyle Lowry + another role player (Ibaka, re-sign Oladipo, Markannen) instead of just being able to sign Lowry."
"Yeah, it still helps. It‚Äôs the difference between being able to make a full bid for Kawhi Leonard while retaining Robinson and Nunn too, and having to trade everyone except Bam and Jimmy to have the space to sign Kawhi.  It‚Äôs the difference between having the cap space to sign Kyle Lowry and another guy (Oladipo, Ibaka, Markannen) and only being able to sign just Lowry.  Bam not having the patience to wait made it much harder for the Heat to improve their roster this summer."
"What have the Chicago Bulls done in that time frame? James Harden‚Äôs second and third options in 2017 were Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly and they were up against Kawhi Leonard, Manu, TP, and Lamarcus Aldridge. Kawhi missed game 6 but LMA was still an ALL NBA caliber player. There‚Äôs a reason why the Spurs nearly broke the home record.There‚Äôs also a lot more to the 0-27 bs. Chris Paul was out and the refs made questionable calls and no calls that forced HOU to switch to perimiter over rim, of which one of the 3s during the 0-27 wasn‚Äôt counted when Harden drained a 3+1 over Klay but the refs called it as a foul before the shot went off causing the possession to reset. That shit changes momentum.Fuck you want him to do, take down Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Kevin Durant by himself? Don‚Äôt come at me with that bs."
"Lol people always exagerate that stuff. Here's what Manu said:  &gt; ""For me, he's not coming back, because it's not helping (to think that he is)"" Ginobili told reporters in San Antonio when asked about his mindset regarding Leonard's potential return. ""We fell for it a week ago, again. I guess you guys made us fall for it. But as I said maybe a month ago, I don't know when it was, we've got to think that he's not coming back, that we are who we are and that we've got to fight without him. That shouldn't be changing, at least until he's ready for the jump ball.""  Basically he just said that the team had to have the mentality that Kawhi wouldn't come back and save them from falling out of the playoffs.  Here's what Tony said:  &gt; Tony Parker on his return from the career-threatening quad injury he suffered last May:  I‚Äôve been through it. It was a rehab for me for eight months. Same kind of injury (as Kawhi), but mine was a hundred times worse. But the same kind of injury. You just stay positive.""  If you watch the video, he's clearly trying to say that since I got over my worse quad injury, Kawhi will get over his. He later [said](https://www.poundingtherock.com/2019/1/16/18185186/tony-parker-sets-the-record-straight-on-the-kawhi-leonard-debacle) that he was mad people thought he was taking a shot at Kawhi.  Did the spurs handle it 100% perfectly? No but 99% of the blame should go to the dude that stopped communicating with his team during the season and then refused to support his teammates in the playoffs. Then in the offseason forced his way out and purposely killed his trade value."
Kawhi Leonard is a Clipper. He slanders himself.
"Nope. Fuck Kawhi Leonard.  People haven't forgotten the shit he pulled in San Antonio. Nobody will forget the way Kawhi treated Popovich after his wife passed away. Nobody will forget about Kawhi's commercial about LA being ""his city"", a shot at LeBron.  Fuck him."
Yes you also got James Harden and Kawhi Leonard
They‚Äôre talking about Kawhi Leonard wtf are u on
"So what about last night? The only people i see being critical are Skip/Shannon. You can google ""Kawhi Leonard"" and more people are making memes about him than being critical."
"There‚Äôs no argument at all lol. Even if Simmons is a better perimeter defender than Gobert, he still isn‚Äôt close to as impactful because what he does will never be as important as what Gobert does. Unless you‚Äôre like Kawhi Leonard or Scottie Pippen, perimeter defenders should never be mentioned in the same conversation as elite defensive bigs."
"I mean, Kawhi Leonard is literally one of those people. Has said in interviews he didn't like the Lakers growing up, even during the Shaq-Kobe era, he was an AI fan."
"I'm a huge believer that Kawhi Leonard stays (especially because they have the assets like Beverley, Kennard, Morris, Zubac, etc. to make some kind of roster upgrade) but if he were to leave I don't think the Clippers toss Paul George away otherwise they're guaranteed to be in the lottery with OKC getting their entire future."
"Players have bad games lol. On average over the last few years, Kawhi Leonard has been an all-time great playoff performer. He just had a bad game at a terrible time. Not everything is about players choking or getting ‚Äúshut down.‚Äù"
I mean you‚Äôre right but also Rondo had 1 point and isn‚Äôt Kawhi Leonard lol. Know your place
"My sources say the death penalty, for fraud, being considered for Kawhi Leonard. I am pro-life and take no pleasure in reporting this."
Yeah I honestly don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt just go up with it immediately. Sure DFS is a good defender but it would be extremely risky to contest hard enough to actually block a kawhi leonard turnaround fade and if DFS bumps into him or gets into his landing space it‚Äôs 3 free throws. Honestly I think kawhi just made a mistake
I don't know about all that. I just know he's the best player in a playoff series in which Kawhi Leonard is playing right now.
"Right? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. The only one close to him was Rondo and if Rondo passed it, the next person would have an even worse shot. And they're not kawhi Leonard. You had two guys running to the rim and with 4 seconds left you have time to get a rebound and kick it out to try another three. It was definitely the right shot"
"Oh shit, Kawhi Leonard. One of most robotic small forwards in the league. But, I put the team on my back doe."
"Whether you like it or not, nobody cares about Milwaukee or Utah and nobody ever will. LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, and LA will always be more interesting than a team in fucking Wisconsin lmao."
Please delete. Not his fault at all. Spurs had a championship team for 15 years before Kawhi entered the league. You might be too young to remember the Spurs winning a championship in 1999 with Duncan before the Lakers won 3 straight but Pop and San Antonio had won numerous titles before Kawhi helped them continue their championship caliber like run from 2012-2014  And the Raptors had already been to conference finals and had a great team chemistry before Leonard got there   The Clippers on the other hand have NEVER been to a conference finals and put together a team that just hasn‚Äôt had a great team chemistry or leadership  Don‚Äôt forget this is Ty Lue‚Äôs first year coaching the Clippers even if he‚Äôs been there as an assistant for multiple years  They‚Äôre just always injured in the playoffs (CP3 years) and have been plagued by chemistry issues
"I'd much rather watch Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and some of the douchebag Clippers personalities face the Jazz than Luka Doncic and... Tim Hardaway Jr.? Kristaps ""$150 million traffic cone"" Porzingis? Maxi Kleber?"
"Kawhi Leonard in 53 playoff games since 2017 entering tonight:  30/9/4 on 51/39/89 splits, with a ring, a FMVP, and a series (2019 ECSF) as close to Jordan reincarnated that I‚Äôve ever seen.   Again, he was awful tonight, but he is an elite playoff performer."
"Next season: Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis join forces and form a new team in LA"
We won‚Äôt ignore the turnovers but we won‚Äôt ignore Reggie Jackson scoring as many points as Kawhi Leonard..  Also Reggie Jackson was hitting 3s in the clutch while Kawhi air balled the tying shot
dorian finney-smith is who kawhi leonard wants to be
Kawhi Leonard would never make that shot from the corner with the game on the line and a defender in his face
REGGIE JACKSON. MARCUS MORRIS. KAWHI LEONARD
"LOL skip bayless is like ""GET KAWHI LEONARD OUT OF THERE""  what an idiot"
"Shocking stat of the night: Kawhi Leonard with a -7, and it's evident in his play  Also: Porzingis is such a waste of size"
Kawhi Leonard please give the ball to someone else.
Leonard is exhausted. He's barely gotten any rest in the 2nd half. Clippers need to play through PG13 down the stretch and let Kawhi focus on defense and rebounding.
Kawhi Leonard
"""AYYYYYYY!"" - Kawhi Leonard"
"Strugglesville, population 1 for Mr. Kawhi ""the Klaw"" Leonard!"
Kawhi Leonard if the Clippers lose in the first round.
"How is a team with Paul George, Rondo and Kawhi Leonard so bad defensively?"
Kawhi ‚Äúayyyyyyyyyyyyye‚Äù Leonard. Every time man.
I‚Äôve said it before I‚Äôll say it again kawhi Leonard is not programmed to lose to the Dallas mavericks
"I see some kawhi leonard in Rui. He needs more touches or a different coach, who might utilize him better."
"Kawho Leonard, Kawhat Leonard, Kawhere Leonard, Kawhen Leonard, Kawhi Leonard."
i feel like they should probably kick out paul george and kawhi leonard for that idk thats just me
"The point is that saying ‚ÄòPascal averaged 20 PPG on 50% shooting in the finals‚Äô is stupid when he was also playing with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry whom were considered the two stars of the team, and the rest of the team composed of Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, and Fred Vanvleet.   Randle would be an outstanding third option, because that‚Äôs much easier than having to be the #1 and be gameplanned against every game.   There‚Äôs a reason why Pascals efficiency dropped 10% after Kawhi left. It‚Äôs just basic common sense. #1 option= very hard. #3 option= much easier"
vs kawhi leonard too..
They can hype themselves up for kawhi leonard before he chooses to sign with la or miami
I require Kawhi Leonard to make less than 60% of his field goals.  Please.
"Exactly.  Jimmy Butler? Left Minny for Miami after just a couple seasons.  Paul George? Left OKC after just a couple seasons.  Kawhi Leonard? Left Tornoto after just a season.  Anthony Davis? Made it clear he would refuse to re-sign with any team other than the Lakers, which he did.  The Kawhi trade only looks good because the Raptors won a ring against a depleted Warriors. Remove the hindsight bias and we could have lost Jaylen Brown for a ECF or Finals loss before losing Kawhi. No thanks. Respectfully to DeRozen, the Raptors didn't give up much - DeRozen's value is significantly lower than Brown's and their timetable was win-now.  IMO the player we should have made more of an effort for Harden."
"Just like our Finals MVP, top 5 player and career Raptor...Kawhi Leonard"
"they probably would have, when he looks defeated the whole team is gonna feel defeated.   your leaders attitude is gonna spread throughout your whole team  you can look at the clippers this year and see it too, they dont talk too much they dont celebrate too much, they dont go crazy for flashy plays, it's all business for them on the court.   cause look who is leading them, kawhi leonard.  not a flashy player, all business, gets it done quietly and efficiently"
Kawhi Leonard.
"The players are 80% responsible for what happens on the floor.  Nick Nurse was out coached by Brett Brown, but Kawhi Leonard wasn‚Äôt outplayed by anybody in that series, so they won."
"&gt; Kawhi Leonard has averaged 33.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 4 games in the 2021 playoffs on 63/48/88 splits"

"I said this yesterday too but my take would be Kawhi Leonard, I'm a huge fan of his and biased but he's putting up absolutely absurdly efficient numbers offensively and still playing elite level defense. I don't think anyone controls the game quite like him + he's progressed as a playmaker to the point where he can still have a huge impact even when his shots aren't falling. Recent success wide he's also probably the most consistent playoff player in the entire league, legacy wise 2 FMVPs + 2 rings, and a DPOY. This year specifically he's been great AND less injured than multiple other superstars and right now against the Mavs he looks inhuman.  Kawhi playoff stats this year: 33.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 2.3 spg, 1.0 bpg on **63/48/88**.  Regular season stats: 24.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 spg, .4 bpg on **51/40/89**."

There‚Äôs not that many people on Reddit with connections to NBA players and there‚Äôs a very small percentage of people willing to share. When you‚Äôre getting information from the inside it‚Äôs kind of a dick move to go public with it and it can also get you cut off from that relationship if they find out.   Anyways I‚Äôm very well connected in the Lakers front office and Kawhi Leonard plans to sign a 4 year deal any second now
"My take would be Kawhi Leonard, I'm a huge fan of his and biased but he's putting up absolutely absurdly efficient numbers offensively and still playing elite level defense.

"I wonder if it'd be in the Heat's best interest to do a soft reset instead of getting Butler back for that type of money. Even if Oladipo was healthy for that Milwaukee series, I'm not even sure if the Heat win that series. They'd win some games but at the end of the day, that roster wouldn't be good enough for anything more than a possible 4th seed that will likely bow out in the conference semi's.   Instead of giving all that money to Butler, why not just go for a soft reset? Adebayo, Herro, Achiuwa, Nunn and I guess Okpala as well(?) would be a good group going forward.   They'd be better off trying to give Kawhi the supermax instead of Jimmy. Kawhi turns 30 in June, Butler will be 32 in September, that's a full 2 years difference and I'd think Riley would much rather be paying Kawhi $50 million a year at 34 than Butler at 36.  There are a lot of players that could potentially hit the market, but the ones that are 100% likely to test the waters are Leonard, DeRozan, Lowry, Conley, Schroder, Holmes, Fournier, Oubre, Hardaway, Miami's own Oladipo and Robinson, along with Rose, Drummond and Williams.  Feel like nabbing Leonard, letting Dragic and Iguodala walk and then possibly getting Robinson back as well would be the best choice of action, along with looking to get some of the lesser shooters. Or if they want to go full rebuild, trying to pry Collins away from the Hawks and also looking at a player like Ball to develop as well could be a decent start.  I'm not a Heat fan, but I don't think keeping Jimmy does much other than keep them a competitive group. The ceiling is as high as Adebayo can develop new skills, because that is their best player down the line. Lots of their role players are older and or going to become expensive soon (like Robinson) so I just feel like a soft or full reset is in order.  They aren't going to be better than Atlanta next year, even though they were close to nabbing the SE title again this past season. Charlotte is probably 2 years away from being just as good if not better, Orlando is a total mystery right now and Washington will always remain a team competing for a playoff spot, no matter how bad the coach and roster is, they have Beal and Westbrook (albeit, a declining Russell).   But for the competition that Riley wants them to be up against, in Milwaukee, Brooklyn and Philadelphia, they simply lack that 1 guy that can be a total boss. Butler is a great player for team ball, but he isn't the player that is going to be getting a bucket down the stretch of games. They have good shooting everywhere and anyone can be the hero, but until they get that boss motherfucker to combat the likes of Giannis, Harden and Embiid, then they are always going to be at a disadvantage."
Dwight Howard or Kawhi Leonard.

Lebron James. Not his best series, but still putting up 22 ppg and 8.5 assists  10. Giannis. In a sweep, put up 23 ppg and 15 rpg  Bonus. Both Devin Booker and Chris Paul. I didn't even mention Anthony Davis. Ayton is the fifth most impactful player in his own series"
Kawhi Leonard has literally never not been on a contender
Kawhi Leonard
I thought Justise Winslow was going to be the next Kawhi Leonard lol
"Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili"
"Durant vs Kawhi 2020-21 stats.     -| Durant | Leonard -|------|------- 3-10 feet num attempts | 102 | 184 3-10 feet FG% | .461 | .522 10-16 feet num attempts | 178 | 206 10-16 feet FG% | .539 | .471 16 feet-3 point line num attempts | 94 | 127 16 feet-3 point line FG% | .511 | .465  Very interesting... Kawhi takes more of the closer mid rangers and makes them at a higher percentage, however, Durant is much better at the deep mid-rangers  EDIT: you can see full results here. [Durant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01/shooting/2021) and [Kawhi](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonaka01/shooting/2021)"
"The Jazz are without doubt a better team than the Mavs but one thing thats true about a Jazz-Clippers series is that the Clippers will much more comfortably have the best player on the floor, and probably the second best as well. That makes a big difference.  However, I will concede that, based on what the Mavs have been able to accomplish in this series, the Jazz (who should still be focused on the grizzlies) have the right tools to compete with the Clippers. League best 3 point shooting, a great rim protector, and a guy in Donovan Mitchell who can penetrate and distribute (albeit far less effectively than Luka) the ball to shooters. The PnR is going to be absolutely huge for them, and in theory Rudy should help slow some of the bleeding against what appears to be a near unstoppable Kawhi Leonard."
"You forget that Kawhi in his third season was as good defensively as Luka is offensively now while already being a VERY efficient scorer (52/38/80). A majority of the spurs success was due to his defense he played against the best of the best game in and game out.      To think that from that point, Kawhi became one of the top 3 players in the entire league defensively AND offensively is just ridiculous. I see the potential of Doncic but he is limited defensively and always will be.      Luka just needs a bit more experience and he will eventually get his championship ring(s), there is no doubt. As of now, Kawhi Leonard is still the better player."
Immanuel Quickley will be an All Star  Jonathan Isaac DPOY   Kawhi Leonard will go down as a top 10 player of all time
I was legitimately just thinking about this like 10 minutes ago.  It‚Äôs controversial but‚Ä¶  Kawhi Leonard.
The Clips have a Kawhi Leonard that the Jazz don't.
"Feel free to throw your money away. You'd have to start watching the NBA like six months ago if you think the Suns can win the title. I hate to break it to you, but the Suns don't have a player named LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, or Giannis Antetokounmpo."

"*never forget*  Breaking News: Kawhi Leonard to Lakers is officially done. Both sides working on minor details at the moment before announcing deal.   ‚Äî RDAmbition, July 1, 2019"
Drew Bledsoe got hurt and the GOAT Tom Brady was born.  Kawhi Leonard got hurt and the GOAT Terance Mann was born.
"Terance ""Grown"" Mann drops a career high 39  Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson drops 27 and 10 assists   Paul George comes up huge in the 4th   And Pat Bev closing with two clutch 3's late and great defense on Spida all series  After being down 25 in the 2nd half  All without Kawhi Leonard. Somebody pinch me because this doesn't feel real. Ty Lue take a fucking bow.   We in uncharted territory now"
This did all of this without Kawhi Leonard‚Ä¶.unreal what a run by the clippers
Terrance Mann turned into Kawhi Leonard. Great adjustment Coach Lue
And this was WITHOUT Kawhi Leonard. Jazz truly choked.
Kawhi Leonard Ewing Theory anyone?  I swear I‚Äôm kidding
Terrance Mann must be using Sharingan and channeling Kawhi Leonard?
Kawhi Leonard Ewing theory is in full effect.
Terrance ‚ÄòKawhi Leonard‚Äô Mann
This game is the epitome of this postseason. I don‚Äôt even know what the fuck is happening any more. Terrance Mann has turned into Kawhi Leonard and Reggie Jackson looks like AI
so Jazz followed up a 3-1 choke job last year to potentially lose 4 straight 2 without Kawhi Leonard
All of this without kawhi leonard. Damn. The clippers really wouldve won the championship
Utah are really choking to Bobby Shmurda and Dollar Tree Kawhi Leonard
"Jordan ""Jesus Christ"" Clarkson scored 21 points in the 2nd. he scored 17 straight by himself, causing Jazz to go up by 25. Terrence ""Kawhi Leonard"" Mann can't miss and has a career high, bringing the Clippers back into it."
Jazz were willing to leave Mann...  ...except Mann decided that he was Kawhi Leonard and hit everything
Is that Kawhi Leonard??  Oh my bad it's just Mann
Terrence 'Kawhi Leonard' Mann
Is Terrance Mann the next kawhi Leonard?
"Terrance ""Kawhi Leonard"" Mann"
They‚Äôre a lot more likable without kawhi Leonard
"Bro stop lying, that‚Äôs literally Kawhi Leonard, what‚Äôs up with the DNP?"
"Is losing in the first round more impressive than potentially losing in the ECF? No. No, I don't  think so.  &gt;Luka was being guarded by Kawhi Leonard  If Clippers decided to start with this, going to 7 doesn't happen, which ruins the basis of this argument. Kawhi didn't guard Luka every game and definitely not in the beginning.  What's more impressive is that the Mavs had a 2-0 lead, were up 19 AT HOME, and still couldn't win the series."
"They were very good last year, they lost to KAWHI Leonard and the clippers, it‚Äôs not like they were heavy favorites or anything. Just because they lost in the first round doesn‚Äôt mean they underperformed they just played stiff conpetition"
"It‚Äôs just the appeal of the unknown. Every 15th pick COULD be Kawhi Leonard. Every 2nd round pick COULD be Nikola Jokic. But more often than not, those picks just end up being dudes you‚Äôve never heard of."
Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi Leonard, Jason Kidd, Lonzo. Those are 3 I thought of off the top of my head. Did you just start watching the NBA? People add things and improve aspects of their games every season. I don‚Äôt want to hear that the guy can‚Äôt shoot outside of dunk range because it‚Äôs ‚Äúreally really fuckin hard.‚Äù You know what else is hard and statistically bordering on impossible? Making it to the NBA"
"He's not a great passer, he heavily relies on iso play. He's not a playmaker like a Jimmy Butler, or even a Paul George/Kawhi Leonard. He doesn't initiate a lot of plays or pass a ton, he's an iso scorer that needs a playmaking guard. Jaylen is the same way"
"I feel like this says everything that needs to be said about this metric  11 - Nicolas Claxton  12  - Dorian Finney-Smith  13 - Nikola Jokic  tie 17 - Kawhi Leonard, Ben Simmons"
"[Actually that‚Äôs not true, AD did waive is kicker.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2019/7/10/20689540/lakers-news-rich-paul-explains-anthony-davis-waive-trade-kicker-kawhi-leonard-free-agency) I remember a few years ago Kyrie also waived his kicker to go to the C‚Äôs.     I‚Äôm not suggesting that Kemba didn‚Äôt want out of the Celtics, all I‚Äôm saying is that he had the ability to waive his kicker to facilitate a deal. It‚Äôs common for disgruntled players to do so, idk how that‚Äôs ‚Äúwildly inaccurate‚Äù lol"
"The starting SG on the third seeded team in the east. He defends well, average 10/6/3/1 and shoot 38% from 3s. Yes he's no kawhi leonard but he is not a nobody."
"Once the bulls get Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson, and Lonzo Ball this offseason, LaVine will easily"

Tell me why I‚Äôm wrong. What is he doing that is god level defending that doesn‚Äôt show up in the box score? I feel like you cavs fans are just confused because of how terrible the rest of your defenders are. You see one dude being semi competent on D and think you‚Äôre watching prime Kawhi leonard or something.
The reality was that the dude who was claiming all of this stuff was probably the guy manipulating this entire sub. The Clippers play the Lakers and the Lakers lost free agents over the course of those eight days until Kawhi Leonard made his choice

"&gt; Compare him to his peers like Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam to name a few who had weaknesses early in their career but improved to develop their offensive game.  Not peers, but Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler were also two guys you wanted the ball far away from while on offense, and look at them now. Avery Bradley is another..."
"&gt; Look at how much rest Kawhi had during the 2019 season and his condition wouldn't go away  This doesn't mean the spurs handled it correctly. Literally the only facts we have are that Kawhi didn't feel so, and that his doctors in new york disagreed with the spurs evaluation of him. The latter happens all the time, sure, but could also point at them being wrong, and at the very least gives credence to the possibility that Kawhi felt like they wronged him.  &gt; His teammates really didn't talk shit.  I don't think it's a stretch to interpret them saying stuff like that as not being 100% supportive of an injured teammate. They were frustrated sure, but that doesn't fly in any sports league.   &gt; Kawhi's camp had total control over his rehab and he ghosted the team through that period.   Total BS spurs fan narrative.   https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Sources-Leonard-still-not-cleared-by-his-12836007.php he was in constant contact with the spurs and pop in new york, and had team officials with him.  &gt; It was also reported that Kawhi refused to meet with Pop and Duncan in NY when they went to visit him.  He did this in free agency, and it's not like he's obligated to meet them then, especially if bridges were apparently burnt."

"Hopefully a lesson learnt by fans.  People hated on me when I said Philly should trade Simmons for Kawhi. ""But, Leonard would have only played for them for one year!"" OK. Kawhi also won a championship in his one year in the East. One more than an Embiid/Simmons duo will ever win.   To be fair, it's unknown if SA would have wanted Simmons. What is known is that Philly could have had Harden if they were willing to part with Ben.   The issue now with Simmons is that he's approaching untradeable range. Contract/not improving (now five full seasons removed from college)/psyche."
"The #1 seed in a stacked Western conference losing *at home* to a team that just lost *maybe* the best player in the game. This should be easy money. They were 8 point favorites. This is the game Utah had a chance to essentially punch their ticket to the WCF but they came out flat.  Conley + some of playoff Mitchell just isn't the same as losing Kawhi Leonard.  Gobert needs to be more impactful. He just *isn't*. And you were the guy a few days ago telling me this was the best defensive season *ever* lol. And I know it's offense, but would it kill the man to score 20 fucking points in a crucial game 6????"
"See Leonard, Kawhi. Although I guess Kawhi did get another ring in Toronto."
"ah, the mediocre tim duncan, tony parker, manu ginobili, kawhi leonard and david robinson"
"Draymond was (is?) an amazing rim protector. In his peak from 2016-2019 he was by a good margin the best pnr defender in the league, his way of defending both the ball handler and the roll man was phenomenal. He was amazing in all aspects of off-ball defense. Ben Simmons is not even in his league in terms of rim protection and off ball defense.  Simmons is a good perimeter defender but unless you're Kawhi Leonard, you can't really make a huge impact defensively form the perimeter. The opposing team can just screen him out of the way.  Draymond also could finish in traffic and make free throws."
"I'm not denying Donte's impacting is being missed. I'm pointing out that his injury is way less jarring in terms of costing a team a championship than like Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, and Mike Conley"
"[Awkward: Paul George Once Dated And Cheated On His New Coach, Doc River‚Äôs Daughter](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/awkward-paul-george-once-dated-and-cheated-on-his-new-coach-doc-rivers-daughter/)  &gt;In 2014, there were rumors about Paul George getting (then) stripper Daniela Rajic pregnant, trying to then pay her $1 million to not have the baby, and have an abortion. Rajic declined and gave birth to a baby-girl.  &gt;Back then,¬†Paul George was in a relationship with Callie Rivers, Doc Rivers‚Äô daughter. As you know, George was just traded to the Los Angeles Clippers to team up with Kawhi Leonard.

Was Kawhi Leonard holding back Reggie Jackson and the Clippers? Coming up next on Undisputed‚Ä¶
"Kawhi ""CM Punk"" Leonard"
"I think Lebron has a point. Though admittedly, it can be said that the short offseason affected more of the Bubble teams that made at least the second round than either the teams that didn‚Äôt get into the Bubble or had early exits like the Suns (though Chris Paul has had some bad luck this playoffs with the bad shoulder and COVID).  I think we should also keep in mind how apparently taxing these last two seasons have been for the teams that got deep into last year‚Äôs playoffs. Brad Stevens reportedly feeling worn down, especially coming out of the Bubble, and moving into the front office could not be a simple coincidence. Even Pat Riley, one who establish this militaristic attitude in the Heat culture, wanted his players and staff to find time to rest up and focus on health first, after a trouncing in the playoffs by the Bucks.  Then you list all of the significant players who played at least up to the second round of the playoffs in the Bubble who had an injury or COVID throughout the season and in the playoffs, it‚Äôs pretty amazing. AD had three significant injuries on one leg. Murray couldn‚Äôt even make it to the playoffs after suffering an ACL tear. Butler was clearly not the same after his signature playoff run in the Bubble. Lebron appears to finally show his age in the playoffs, not helped while recovering from a high ankle sprain from bad luck when Solomon Hill landed on his ankle in the second half of the season. Harden dealing with his hamstring multiple times. Lebron and Harden have played over 90% of the games played since 2009-10, mind you, along with Russell Westbrook, who also suffered injuries these last two seasons. Kawhi Leonard apparently just suffered an ACL sprain (?).  This year‚Äôs playoffs has had its moments, but it‚Äôs unfortunate that we‚Äôre seeing more All Star injured and either missing time or showing obvious decline in their play. Sure, injuries are a thing in sports. I‚Äôve had my share playing sports. But it‚Äôs something to consider with all that has happened the last year and a half."
"probably the most important section of the piece  &gt;From the looks of things, Leonard received an MRI that was inconclusive, and needs more time for a clearer result. As of right now, Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers are hopeful that it's just an ACL sprain. The MRI can reveal more within the next couple of days"

There is no Kawhi Leonard this series + Suns play smarter than Utah
A lot. Fuck Kawhi Leonard.  People haven't forgotten how he treated Pop after Pop's wife passed away.
"shoutout to this clippers team, man. SO fucking resilient. they lose a top 5 superstar in kawhi leonard, their clear best player ... and they still knock off the one seed and play three competitive games against the two seed in the WCF, only down 2-1.   it's a shame that kawhi is out ... can't help but think they'd be the favorites to win it all.  i also feel so vindicated as someone who's been defending tyronn lue for years. yall memed him and said he was just a ""players coach"" but nah this dude can fucking coach."
Ouch.   Reminder when people acted like Suns without CP3 was akin to the clips being without Kawhi Leonard. Lol.
"if kawhi leonard comes back, this is over"
is this subreddit gonna keep slurpin off the suns for being the most dominant team since Warriors and 01 Lakers when the Clippers have been very competitive every game without their Top 5 superstar in Kawhi Leonard?
[Who asked for the Kawhi laughing gif?](https://laughposter.blogspot.com/2019/04/kawhi-leonard-laugh-gif-with-sound.html?m=1)
Kawhi Leonard. My flair has nothing to do with my reason.
"For all the 1-on-1 defender greatness, it seems a habit with Milwaukee to have superstars go nova.    Last night, Trea Young goes crazy.    2020 Jimmy Butler. reg season ppg: 19.8  Bucks series ppg: 23.5    2019 Kawhi Leonard. reg season ppg: 26.4  Bucks series ppg: 29.8"
Kawhi Leonard was a complete outlier and Duncan+Ginobli+Parker took discounts they weren‚Äôt making nearly the same percentage of the cap that Dray+Steph+Klay make.  If you don‚Äôt want to move Wiseman fine but use 7 and 14 to make actual upgrades to the roster.
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"For entertainment, Undisputed only because Skip pretends to hate Lebron and Shannon stays on Lebrons dick.  But as far as sports analysis, Neither. They offer absolutely NO insight or are even accurate with their takes. Most notable being Undisputed having Chris Broussard give his ""expert reporting"" or ""inside scoop"", that 99% Kawhi Leonard was going to be a Laker."
"Also, the Clippers look like a badass team. They're barely losing to these suns WITHOUT KAWHI LEONARD. The Mavs would've blown these Clippers out.   The Hawks have played well, and I love Trae and what he's dong on the court, but it's so bizarre how a player can play terribly in a game 7, hit 2 shots in a close game that's only close because they're shooting so poorly, and then win because the other team shits the bed, and then have their stock go up."
"I mean - if you want to broaden this argument, if a players peak is in his 30s why is it that only 9 teams in NBA history have won a ring with an average weighted age of over 30 years old (weighted by minutes)? Where are all the teams of prime players in their early 30s?  So I'm curious, lets see how this goes... I'm gonna go team by team, and lets see who leads them in Win Shares by year and the age of that player...  While imperfect - the biggest weirdnesses balanced out (Kobe in his early 30s was clearly more important to the Lakers than Pau in 2009/2010 ... But Isiah in his late 20s was clearly more important to the Pistons than Laimbeer in 1989/1990).  If the prime of players extends well into their 30s... Why are only 12/40 teams led by guys in their 30s? 6 at Dirk-age-or-older (32+). Twice as many players are age 26-29 as are 30+ (24 to 12).  You start getting to Dirk's age at that 2011 championship, and title winning as a top player becomes clearly harder, only 1/4 as many dudes up at that age or older. You've got some great exceptions you can bring up... but the weighted ages of teams aren't in their 30s, and typically the top performer on a championship team isn't in his 30s. Top performer doesn't necessarily mean best player in the playoffs, but if the PRIME was as long as you say - it would make up a MUCH larger portion of this list.  2020 - Anthony Davis, age 26  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29  2017 - Steph Curry, 28  2016 - LeBron James, 31  2015 - Steph Curry, 26  2014 - Tim Duncan, 37  2013 - LeBron James, 28  2012 - LeBron James, 27  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32  2010 - Pau Gasol, 29  2009 - Pau Gasol, 28  2008 - Kevin Garnett, 31  2007 - Tim Duncan, 30  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27  1990 - Bill Laimbeer, 32  1989 - Bill Laimbeer, 31  1988 - Magic Johnson, 28  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27  1986 - Larry Bird, 29  1985 - Magic Johnson, 25  1984 - Larry Bird, 27  1983 - Moses Malone, 27  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22  1981 - Robert Parrish, 27"
"If Bradley Beal demanded a trade to the Kings along with Kawhi Leonard and Zion Williamson they would have the best ‚Äúbig 3‚Äù in the West and would be favourites in the conference‚Ä¶‚Ä¶nobody cares about your whiney ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù. Bron got hurt and that sucks but the whole league is hurt, he‚Äôs the best player on the planet.  Just let some team have their moment without making it about the Lakers"
"Kawhi leonard posterising tf out of favours,Austin rivers thanking god that dame missed a shot,Ayton game winner,middleton game winner in game 1 against the heat,Kd losing cause the shoes he wears are big af."
Kawhi Leonard
"&gt;People are so much more willing to discredit the Suns run because we are beating a team that beat the Jazz  That's a good point, but at the end the Clippers are missing Kawhi Leonard, who people were talking a week ago as maybe the best player in the world or 2nd only to KD. It'd just be disingenious to pretend that's not a huge advantage.  Nuggets had a great record post Jamal but nobody's going to claim they were a better team without a guy who averaged 21 with 59% TS. He was easily their second best player.  Lakers were at worst even with the Suns when AD played. They lost both games without him.  At the end though it doesn't matter. Raptors won a ring in 2019 with KD hurt, and they most likely would've lost if KD played the whole series, but who cares? Ring's a ring and Raptors will forever be champions."
"Maybe that argument flies if the Phoenix Suns weren't a top team in the west the whole season but it's not like the success is coming out of nowhere , they were favored in most of these series because they were the better team not because the other team was hurt.   Denver has been dealing with injuries the last two months, not Phoenix fault that they had to play a hurt team based upon the playoff schedule. Don't act like people actually thought the Clippers would also get this far either, people were definitely ready for an early playoff exit Kawhi Leonard just turned into a superhuman and carried his team until he got hurt doing it. I mean as a Lakers fan you were probably one of the loudest voices in crapping all over the Clippers and how badly they choke  By your own logic it's on those other players and teams for getting hurt you so you shouldn't penalize Phoenix for it. If you penalize Chris Paul for getting hurt  you have to penalize the other people.   No surprise the Lakers fans suddenly has a different opinion of injuries when the shoe's on his foot. You constructed your roster in such a way where the majority of your money is going to really a player with injury issues, an aging Superstar who cannot consistently do everything to keep his team in the game, and a bunch of role players or aging veterans. Denver hadn't had their second best player since the middle of April and they still managed to make the playoffs with a good seed so quit whining"
"You should be enjoying the playoffs right now then. You‚Äôve got guys like Kyrie, KD, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, CP3, Jokic, Embiid, Tobias Harris all making a killing in the mid range this postseason. It may not be in the regular season but this postseason has seen the return of the mid range game. And it‚Äôs awesome."
"Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan"
Dunno about this subs weird hate boner for the Clips. I get half the sub is Lakers fans but still. Also seeing them beat Utah without Kawhi fucking Leonard was dope.
"Kawhi Leonard is better at basketball than Luka Doncic, yes."
"Even the Raptors were a mini super team. Kawhi Leonard jumping ship and joining a playoff caliber team with Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol and Danny Green."
"I mean Luka averaged 36/8/10 in the first round, he just happened to go up against Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers. Still took them to 7"
"Meanwhile, the Clippers' top player, Kawhi Leonard, will remain out for Game 3. Leonard sustained a knee injury in the Utah series, and it's believed to be an anterior cruciate ligament issue. Reports regarding his prognosis range from sidelined for this series to questionable for next season's opener."
Kawhi Leonard = Luka's daddy
How about 46 points and 14 assists on 17/30 shooting in a game 7 where he was hounded by Kawhi Leonard yet still lost because his team sucked ass  Im a huge Trae fan but the only reason Trae is having more success is because the Hawks built around him better
"Yeah and Luka averaged like 35 against Kawhi Leonard and Pail George, with a much worse team around him."
Kevin ‚ÄúKawhi Leonard‚Äù Huerter
"I feel for Clippers fans. Zero success in their entire history, finally break the WCF curse... but they‚Äôre rewarded with a Kawhi Leonard injury. Top 5 player in the league, gone.   And it‚Äôs looking like a wide open chip with the Nets and Lakers out. Coulda been their best shot and they‚Äôre fucked by an injury."
Without AD. Without Jamal Murray. Without Kawhi Leonard.
"Awesome  Hoping this seals the deal and knocks the piece of shit kawhi Leonard out of the playoffs yet again  It‚Äôs all downhill from here for clippers, kawhi and PG are not going to improve at this point and only deal with more and more injuries"
This reminded me of when Kawhi Leonard missed those free throws against Miami a few years back. The series was over.
Do you expect the Clippers to win a championship without Kawhi Leonard? It‚Äôs not an excuse if it‚Äôs justified.
I agree getting to the WCF is good for them but it isn‚Äôt like they got Kawhi and PG just to lose in the WCF. It‚Äôll be disappointing if they never get it done but it was the decision to make when you have the chance to get Kawhi Leonard on your squad
"A WCF is the bare minimum for a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and it‚Äôs only being looked at as an improvement because of how much of a failure and collapse last season was for them.   The expectations for the Clippers is championship or bust just like the Lakers and Nets and if you use the health excuse for the Clippers you have to use it for the Nets, Lakers, Nuggets, etc."
"With Leonard out and a 2-0 lead that shit feels done to me, unless Kawhi is close to returning."
"I'm confident in the Clippers ability to shoot well that I think they'll steal game 3, but they're outmatched in a 7 game series unless Kawhi Leonard can return."
WOJ said that Kawhi is unlikely to return  Edit: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944989-woj-clippers-not-confident-kawhi-leonard-will-return-from-injury-vs-suns
"Ignoring injured players, sure, but your phrasing makes it seem like you forget that the Nuggets and the Clippers are missing some of their superstars too (i.e a 4th/5th string guard [Dozier] being 1st string due to injuries, Jamal Murray out due to ACL, and Kawhi Leonard out currently against Suns)  If Kawhi doesn't return, then yes, I would agree that Lakers would be the best team they've faced, but you can't ignore that the Nuggets and Clippers have more critical injuries than what the Lakers dealt with"
"We missed out on the greatest Olympic Men‚Äôs Basketball team because of the pandemic and injuries. Yes, better than ‚Äò92  LeBron James Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson Steph Curry  Dame Lillard  Draymond Green Bam Adebayo  James Harden Chris Paul  Devin Booker"
"It should be VERY concerning to the Bucks that Jae Crowder and Kawhi Leonard were the players who were the primary perimeter defenders on Giannis when the Bucks lost in the playoffs, and now Kawhi is on one of the teams in the WCF and Crowder is on the other team."
"They've played the best and most consistent against teams missing AD, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard but somehow everyone ignores that aspect unless they're using it to dunk on the Bucks."
"And yet, Jordan was *far and away* the better defensive player.  Like, it's not even close.  Jordan won multiple scoring titles *and* DPOY.  There were seasons in the NBA where he was the best player on *both* sides of the ball.  He was Kawhi Leonard if Kawhi was capable of putting up 50 points on any given night on offense."
"my issue has nothing to do with the teams that are in the finals.  this is a player-driven league, and the fact is this season has had injuries/absences from impactful players way way more than previous seasons.  it is due to the condensed schedule and covid-19, but that doesn't make the product any better.  people want to see Kawhi Leonard much more than they want to see Marcus Morris.  they want to see CP3 more than they want to watch Torrey Craig.  i don't really care what teams are in the Finals, but i want the best players beating the other best players to get there.  the product is definitely diminished this year due to Covid."
They are missing Kawhi Leonard
"I‚Äôm not a doctor, but even doctors don‚Äôt diagnose injuries from a distance. And YouTube doctors are generally chasing algorithms. For instance, as the title to that video suggests, the words ‚Äúkawhi leonard‚Äù and ‚Äúacl tear‚Äùwere the terms to hit to get people to click through that video.   Like I said, if it‚Äôs safe, than yeah. It‚Äôs kawhi Leonard, no one actually knows that much about the situation"
"I don‚Äôt know. With our roster it‚Äôs either too high ‚Äî like I‚Äôm not trading Kawhi Leonard for Cade ‚Äî or too low: Detroit would never take Terrance Mann, Marcus Morris and some 2nds for Cade."
Kawhi Leonard. That is all
"Partially, Suns faced a Lakers team without Anthony Davis, a Denver team without Jamal Murray and now a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard, it's almost identical to the Warriors first title run just with more star power being out. Warriors faced a Pelicans team with a hobbled Eric Gordon.... A Grizzlies team who missed Conley in the first game arguably their second best player after Gasol, fully healthy Rockets squad and then a Cavs team basically without the 2 best players after LeBron.  Overall it's about the same in improbability since those Warriors is obviously a better team than the Suns this season and the level of competition the Suns faced is skewed since the teams they faced so far didn't have their number 2 or even number 1 option in Kawhi. However without CP3 being out I guess it cancels out Kawhi being gone."
"Not really, he‚Äôs got as strong of a playoff resume as literally anyone and you‚Äôre all underrating out actual champion and certain first ballot hall of gamer Kawhi Leonard who way outweighs CP3 who has seen his role filled by Payne for whatever reason‚Ä¶Idk have a feeling of Clips in 6"
"It‚Äôs possible but I think the difference between his play vs Payne and between kawhi Leonard and the next guy up is tremendous, if they have Kawhi he‚Äôs taking those last shots at the FT line and they are winning, if we‚Äôre going to compare Kawhis impact to Paul‚Äôs impact you might be in for a significant shock"
lol looks whos talking. You're an AD hamstring from being a 1st round exit and a Jamal Murray ACL from being a 2nd round exit and a Kawhi Leonard knee from being a 3rd round exit
Clippers: I'll counter with Player Reborn! Kawhi Leonard in Attack Mode!
"no. With Leonard and Paul, it's probably close. But Kawhi is the Clippers' first option, pretty much irreplaceable, and Chris Paul, no matter how great he is (and he is great), is the second or even the third fiddle in Phoenix."
Kawhi Leonard was literally not even in Phoenix tonight
"Plays like Zaza's happened multiple times a game at that point, and *still* happen way too often to some players. Meanwhile Kawhi Leonard trod on his own teammate's foot *before* that happened and hit the floor, because he got injured in the previous round.  The team that still celebrates Bruise Bowen really needs to shut the fuck up about that shit."
Ur acting like the clippers aren't missing kawhi Leonard lmao
Yeah that's crazy ever heard of kawhi Leonard?
Quick reminder than Sixers refused to trade Ben Simmons X Kawhi Leonard on 2018 and Ben Simmons X James Harden on 2020
Nobody is that dumb.  It's a 5 person draft with the 5th person being Kuminga who is the biggest boom or bust guy.  The top 4 are sure things Kuminga is a high upside guy who may be a bust.  He's either gonna be Kawhi Leonard or Josh Jackson.  He has no medium outcome.  We gotta take Davion Mitchell because he's an older rookie with upside.

"I think he formed media relationships as his time as a colour commentator before he took up a coaching job. Plus be always gives the media a soundbyte or a quotable. He keeps getting away with this bs because he's charismatic at least to the media. I do t find him that personable at all. He rarely is annoyed at the media or dresses them down. So they like him.   Even when they show his stats on an infographic I see them prefacing it or just transitioning straight Into Ben Simmons and making doc rivers record look like a circumstance losses rather than doc being a bad coach.  For example it's not docs fault last year, Leonard and George didn't step up. Even though Leonard and George were good in game 5 and 6, doc messed that up with rotations. Shannon Sharpe actually blamed kawhi and Paul George for costing a 'good man' his job lol.   The collapses in Philly. Is it doc fault? I saw after game 5. Tons of media asking   But then game 7 happen and Ben Simmons doesnt dunk an open shot the question now has an answer. It wasn't doc it was Ben! Then doc throws him under the bus.   Pathetic how the media protects this guy."
"I feel Bruce Bowen's journalistic integrity is in question regarding the Spurs since he commentated for the ESPN and LA Clippers but was subsequently fired after making comments about the Kawhi Leonard singing the same year he was hired.  He's never been known for insider information.  So, yes, I probably know just as much as Bruce Bowen which is nada.  The only difference is I'm not posting my opinion as insider information online.  And I certainly know more than you."
Y‚Äôall let wood walk like a bunch of idiots. Also who cares about free agency if our front office can finesse some trades? Ever heard of kawhi Leonard?
"Doc is a terrible coach. He's had so many great players, hof players and he's won once, and made 2 finals appearances, while the celtics made multiple conf finals when he left, only to be really stopped by lebron during doc's clipper tenure.   Brett Brown lost to kawhi leonard on a basket with 04.2 to go. Doc Rivers lost to kevin huerter bulling seth curry in the post in game 7.  Who's really responsible for the collapse? it's doc. Think about it the 26pt lead. Does that happen without hack a ben? How is atlanta going to generate 27 points without fouling a terrible FT shooter to come back in the game. You mean you couldn't keep ben out for that amount of time?  Come on man. I've seen the doc story way too much. He made Kawhi Leonard look like tony snell in game 7 and had him guarding Jokic because he refused to take out montrezl harrell who was a -61 for the entire playoff run. Jokic even said it himself that Zubac is a tough defender after the series.   Doc didn't play zu in second halfs of the game, pretty much all year.   When Ben Simmons gets traded and he will and Doc messes up again, you'll see doc is a bigger issue to worry about then ben simmons. Ben simmons just has a shit contract, that's really all. He's a decent player, just not a max or big contract player."
"He is form was never terrible, it was a flat throwing motion rather than an elevated flick of the wrist. His left hand also pushed the ball instead of guiding it towards the rim. Watch Kawhi college tape and then watch JJ Redick college tape to see what jump shooting is supposedly look like.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to believe there was a time when Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs jump shot was seen as his biggest weakness. But that‚Äôs the situation he found himself in following his sophomore season at San Diego State. Not only did Leonard make a total of 41 3-pointers during his two years in college, he struggled to knock down catch-and-shoot jumpers and pull-ups with any sort of regularity. According to Draft Express, that translated into him averaging a dismal 0.743 points per jump shot ‚Äî think of Andre Roberson on spot-ups ‚Äî which was the second-worst mark in his class.‚Äù  Edit: link   https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2017/05/10/kawhi-leonard-3-point-jump-shot-nba-draft/amp/"
Make that three busts and a Kawhi Leonard laugh as my choice of orgasm sound
"calling simmons an ""all star"" in an attempt to not mention how he actually performs is just BS. he is trash.   basically gives the opposing team an extra defender, and gets paid the same $ as kawhi leonard"
Lmfao are you serious ‚Äúask anyone on the team‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize you were such close personal friends with everyone from the ‚Äò19 team. Why don‚Äôt you shoot them some texts and ask them for me. I‚Äôm a Kawhi Leonard fan. I‚Äôve followed him since his rookie season. Meaning I followed the ‚Äò19 Raptors. Kawhi Leonard [was the leader of that team ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2019/6/8/18657581/kawhi-leonard-raptors-warriors-nba-finals-leadership) and this perceived notion that Kawhi ‚Äúisn‚Äôt a leader‚Äù is a media driven narrative because a.) they think since he doesn‚Äôt talk to the media he doesn‚Äôt talk and b.) Gregg Popovich came out and said he wasn‚Äôt the leader of Spurs teams that were led by Tim Duncan. And Serge Ibaka passed Lowry the trophy because he was the longest tenured Raptor. What‚Äôs sad is that you are a Raptors fan and have no fucking clue what you‚Äôre talking about.
Spurs traded derozan for kawhi Leonard. An all time trash trade. Let‚Äôs not act like there front office post Duncan recently has been very good
"I'm aware of Phoenix's trials and tribulations the past 10 or so years, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I want to see teams play fully healthy. Everyone should. And I was in no way implying this season deserves an asterisk. But OP suggesting that Kawhi Leonard coming back on a hobbled knee is ""bullshit"" after a relatively healthy playoff run (except CP3 who is expected back for Game 3), playing two teams without one of their stars, and having a good amount of rest between scheduled games is... well nonsense.   I'd like to see Phoenix get a good scare in them and actually have to play to their top level cause if they make it to the Finals and it's the Bucks they're gonna have no playoff experience playing 3 good offensive/defensive stars (Jrue, Middleton, and Giannis) if the closest they've come to that has been George, Morris and Batum."
"""The 'last straw' for Kawhi Leonard were Tony Parker's comments about Leonard's injury.""-Woj  ""When the journalist asked me if my injury was worse than Kawhi‚Äôs, I said yes because it was true. But that didn‚Äôt lessen the significance of his injury."" -Tony Parker"
"It‚Äôs wild how all of these old vets are getting huge fucking paydays. Jimmy Butler, Kyler Lowry, Kawhi Leonard (eventually), and CP3. Im not saying they‚Äôre undeserved, but the game has changed. These old heads are still producing and valuable to teams despite being ‚Äúpast their prime‚Äù or injury prone‚Ä¶ or both lol"
"I don't see how you're helping your argument here. The Jazz won without Conley and didn't win with Conley. And that was with Kawhi Leonard missing.  Doesn't matter anyhow, as long as the Jazz have Gobert their ceiling is capped. Conley or no Conley."
Full Given Name:  Kawhi A. Leonard.
"I mean, this is the same Kawhi Leonard that reportedly blew off Spurs security during All Star weekend because he thought they were trying to exert power over him."
"I consider injury-prone to mean someone who picks up small injuries that keep them out a few games at a time or force them to leave midway throughout the game.  in the last 3 seasons Curry has missed time for a groin injury, a hand fracture and a tailbone fracture. 3 major injuries.  AD has missed time for a Groin strain, knee strains, adductor strains, calf strains, achilles strains, quad strains etc etc. [Source](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)  Kawhi has missed time for Knee, Foot, Back, Leg, Rest and Load management. [Source](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/kawhi-leonard-player-injuries)  Clearly not the same, it's like saying Klay is more injury prone than Kawhi/AD because he's missed the last 2 season combined.   Why didn't you put KD on this list? he's only played 113 games in the last 3 seasons combined. the stats you chose to provide are cherrypicked, hope I've helped you understand how"
He didn't tell Kawhi to fuck off but was already set on playing with Kyrie on the Nets so he declined.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-tried-to-recruit-kevin-durant-to-clippers-before-start-of-free-agency-per-report/
Kawhi Leonard= DBS Frost confirmed.
"Obviously Russ‚Äôs team made her aware of the call he placed to Kawhi. The fact that Kawhi called PG isn‚Äôt breaking news.  The story isn‚Äôt untrue, but it‚Äôs the spin she puts on it. Why is Leonard the villain of the story when Russ called him?"
"I don't think the situation went down the way the story suggests it did, painting Kawhi as the only malacious party. Both guys from OKC left. It sounds like they were all exploring their options and Kawhi chose PG and Russ was cool with it. Russ went to Houston. I'm sure both had multiple places they were willing to be traded to if they didn't get their preferred destination.  This story makes it sound like Kawhi Leonard went and devised some diabolical plan to rob OKC of assets and leave Russell Westbrook stranded with no-name players for two years before the Lakers dealt him a trade.  Lazy reporting, imo."
I'm struggling to understand how kawhi is the shitty one here. Russ and PG were tight it looks like. PG re-signed and said they had unfinished business. Meanwhile Russ tried to get to LA with kawhi Leonard   Kawhi preferred the better player.
Kawhi Leonard plans turn into Kyle Lowry plans that turn into Goran Dragic plans but end up ultimately just resulting in Kelly Oubre and Dennis Schroder for a combined $35 mil APY plans.
Lmao where‚Äôs all the people who said he wasn‚Äôt gonna sign a contract extension and ask out because he lost in the first round to fucking kawhi leonard and paul george in 7 games
"Kawhi Leonard reportedly spurned Russell Westbrook in favor of Westbrook's then-Oklahoma City Thunder teammate Paul George before signing with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2019, according to¬†[Ramona Shelburne](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31937985/how-two-phone-calls-two-years-apart-led-los-angeles-lakers-landing-russell-westbrook)¬†of ESPN.  Per Shelburne, Westbrook initiated a conversation with Leonard about teaming up in Los Angeles, but Leonard responded by reaching out to George instead.  The Clippers eventually traded for George and signed Leonard as a free agent to create a top contender in the Western Conference. Westbrook was traded to the Houston Rockets later that offseason and has since moved to the Washington Wizards and¬†[now](https://www.nba.com/news/wizards-russell-westbrook-traded-to-lakers)¬†the Los Angeles Lakers.  ¬†"

Is kawhi leonard ruining the clippers?
Kawhi 'Littlefinger' Leonard
"Yeah, it's missing the first bit. I had to read through to understand   &gt;Teaming up with Leonard would be the fastest way there[winning], so he placed the call, according to multiple sources. But Leonard didn't just take the call as one native son of Los Angeles to another, ponder it and file it away.  &gt;He used it.  &gt;According to multiple sources, Leonard then called Westbrook's teammate in Oklahoma City, Paul George, and told him he'd rather team up with him on a homecoming.  WB called Kawhi.   Kawhi called PG."

"&gt;The Suns had an amazing season but deep down I feel the Clips with a healthy Kawhi would have won that series  I mean the Clippers took them 6 without Kawhi who's at minimum a top 5 player.

"Wtf, no, if anything this series makes them look even worse. They were always expected to win, they had a better roster, more star power. The Mavs were a one-man show, the Clips had KAWHI FUCKING LEONARD and PG. This series should have ended in 5, maximum 6 games, not go down to the wire. The Clips have been disappointing and I hope the Jazz beat them in the next round, even though deep down I know that the Clippers could deginitely win."

"""Indubitably."" -Kawhi Anthony Leonard, best player in the world"
What a freakin series!! Clips down 0-2 loosing home court and came back roaring and thumped the Mavs...you love to see all the people predicting the Mavs sweeping the Clippers...eat their words!  Luka played out of his mind but the guy needed more help. And NO he‚Äôs not better than the two time champion two time finals MVP best two way player in the NBA...Kawhi the üêê Leonard!! He‚Äôs just what people think he is...a great 22 year old offensive player. Hope he‚Äôll come back down to earth from all the hype people created about him and work on his defense. Onto Utah!
"PG Chris Paul - 2018-19 (14th season)   SG Magic Johnson - 1979-80 (rookie season)    SF Kawhi Leonard - 2012-13 (2nd season)   PF Larry Bird - 1980-81 (2nd season)   C   Tim Duncan - 2015-16 (final season)  I used a blend of Box Plus/Minus along with WS/48 as my criteria for choosing this team. I lose the sheer firepower of Michael Jordan or Wilt Chamberlain. However, in a best of seven series, I'd put them against just about any team out there."
"&gt;but with my season on the line, I want Kawhi Leonard.  Kawhi really proved to be the better player by outplaying Jokic in game 7 last year. Oh wait, Jokic crushed his whole team and sent them packing while Kawhi shit the bed."
Kawhi Leonard is good at basketball.
Kawhi Leonard makes me want to go out and practice defense all day. He makes it look so fun to do.
"Raps in 7 because of Kawhi ""the LeBron stopper"" Leonard"
TIER ONE  1. Kawhi Leonard  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. LeBron James  TIER TWO  5. James Harden  6. Luka Doncic  7. Giannis Atentokounmpo  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard
Completely insane. And Kawhi Leonard is still 29 years old!! Unbelievable. He'll be 30 in a few weeks. Every year I'm shocked at how old he is lol
Can't wait for Kawhi Leonard to host a SNL episode after this wonderful display of improv.
"Fuck Kawhi.   Have people forgotten how shitty Kawhi treated Pop and handled that situation? How Kawhi handled the situation after Pop‚Äôs wife passed away? What happened to all my fellow homies who also don‚Äôt like him?  Fuck Kawhi Leonard. He will never, ever be viewed in the same light as LeBron or Curry. Or even Luka Doncic.   Fuck Kawhi and fuck Paul George.   Man, I just feel so bad for Luka :("
Kawhi Leonard is a different beast in the playoffs. He's making an argument for top 20 all time
Steph and Kobe neutralize most of the starting guards except MJ and Magic since he can use a size advantage. KG can hold every 4-5 including Tim while also scoring at the same rate. Kareem is just on another stratosphere offensively and defensively in his prime. And to top it of Kawhi freaking Leonard in his prime.... 2 is the obvious choice to me
"Morris has had numerous off the court controversies and patrick beverly is the biggest all bark no bite player in the NBA. Both also have very well documented attempts at injuring other players.   Wade has had some dirty plays, but outside of the rondo incident, you cant argue he ever tried to hurt anyone, and even with the rondo incident, its pretty clear that Wade just fell onto his arm after trying to pull him down. Unfortunate and probably dirty, but not intentionally injuring someone like Morris with Luka or PatBev with Westbrook.   The fact that you're trying to compare those two to Wade Delly and JR really shows your bias, especially when you're ignoring the fact that Paul George and Kawhi Leonard aren't exactly winning over many fans with the way they both forced their way off their teams mid-contract to chase rings."
which is why paul george and kawhi leonard were 4-0 but donovan mitchell was 4-3 in the first round. wait
"Part of the reason Luka was fatigued is because of the difficulty he had getting good shots in the first half. In no small part due to Kawhi Leonard.  In this game 7, Kawhi‚Äôs defensive ability had more stamina than Luka‚Äôs offensive ability."
"The rosters Lue has coached have consisted of Lebron who literally made 8 straight finals no matter who was coaching and a Clippers team with Kawhi Leonard, PG, and some of the best depth in the league that have been considered a top 3 title favorite since they got together. When you‚Äôre always coaching a top 5 roster in the league it‚Äôs not exceptionally hard to finish as a top 4 seed and win a playoff series.    Not trying to take away from him, but it‚Äôs hard to judge the quality of a coach when they‚Äôve had it as easy as Lue has."

Send Mark Cuban a Kawhi Leonard mixtape!
Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the world... respectfully
"Kawhi was not put on Luka for the first half of this series and when he was Luka feasted. Luka simply became exhausted as the game went on, which is when Lue put Leonard on him; a good decision on the Clippers part."
This was the Kawhi Leonard that many people thought was the best player in the world two years ago. Obviously Luka still got off and got his numbers but that was basically on every defender except Kawhi
"Dude he's 22 and just played his second series ever and both of those series were against a loaded team led by kawhi Leonard. With better seeding Lukas Performance would def have been enough for the semis. He's well within the timeline losing both of those series, Leonard isn't even 30 yet. The clippers are loaded with wing defenders, yet Luka was inevitable every game. I think theres at the very least an argument that he's been the best player this series and there's zero doubt in my mind that he's been the most impactful player for either team. Tonight the role players won the game for the clippers while porzingis was an absolute no show the entire series. This guy can't box out to save his life and yet it went to 7 games and a highly contested last one at that. This sub is very reactionary so don't mind the people claiming the clippers are frauds but this series should have never gone to 7 games to begin with. The mavs are seriously undermanned and had to rely on finney-smith, hardaway or boban to bring the nightly Co-Star performance. This series by Luka was an all-time great all around performance and he's poised to get his eventually."
When you take into account the efficiency on offence and consistently good defence... the ability to score when you absolutely need a bucket  Kawhi Leonard is the best all around player in the nba

Kawhi Leonard and lebron James. I joke he definitely made the adjustments down the stretch. Going with Morris from the start was the right move.

I Really Like Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard is built for the playoffs
"They‚Äôre in a huge market with a very rich owner with one of the highest payrolls in the league. They had Chris Paul, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard all force their way there in the past decade.  I want to see a team like the jazz win. Small market, well run, not built by star players forcing their way there etc."
Clippers..great 3 pt shooting team. Great Defensive team..Kawhi Leonard. Jazz do not stand a chance in my opinion.

"""The gentleman"" Kawhi Leonard"
"A 22 year old took Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to 7 games, I feel great actually. Mavs bench was ass too. He will have his shots at a chip soon."
Kawhi 'Gentleman' Leonard
"Poetl = Top 5 defensive center.   Johnson = Rising sophomore star with excellent defense and 0.36 3-pt shooting   Murray = all-defensive team and playmaker   White-Walker = above 0.36 3 pt shooting.     All this with Kawhi Leonard forcing his way out. For the situation they were put in, the Spurs made an incredible turnaround. Yes, we would have wanted Kawhi to stay and still be in the top 4 standings today, but life isn't fair. The spurs  had to adapt given the circumstances and did well.    Give it 2-3 years, the spurs will be back in the top 3 standings in the west. They'll be as good as the 2021 Jazz, who are #1 this year."

"&gt;So for that fact I'd say Kawhi still carried harder, as he won both the Philly and Bucks series all by himself  Well Duncan won 3 series all by himself, and 1 of those was against the Shaq/Kobe 3peat Lakers. Raptors didn't face anyone as good as the Lakers. Duncan averaged 28/15/5/3 over the last 3 series, including the Finals. Not only was Duncan more important defensively than Kawhi, he also averaged more assists than Kawhi over the whole playoffs. Duncan carried harder for sure.   &gt;19 Kawhi did have better teammates than 03 Duncan, however, Duncan's teammates played above their true skill and Kawhi's didn't.   What are you basing this on? This just isn't true at all.  &gt;That said, fuck Kawhi Leonard as great as he is, and GO MAVS!  Fuck Kawhi Leonard is something we can both agree on."

Above average defense (Portland desperatly needs), and solid off-ball shooting. Just needs to be in the right situation to thrive again. Which is what Portland has."

"&gt; There are probably some, but it's far from a majority like you'd get the impression out of that guy's comment where he acts like he got downvoted to hell, when in reality his comment was at 0 votes when I first checked it.  I agree, its not the majority but its pretty viral impression that a lot of fans have. I'm not saying the majority, but vocal enough that you see it on twitter with thousands of likes and stuff like that.  Here's some   [tweet 1](https://twitter.com/Original_Gio/status/1397421301845749763)  [Tweet 2](https://twitter.com/Derozanxx/status/1400528609048207360)  There are much more viral ones*and older ones) but for some reason, I can't find them on search, but I remember raptor fans being very upset.   It turns into this semantic argument b/t carry and led. I don't know why carry has a negative connotation the way that some fans are taking it. For that reason a lone, some raptor fans want Kawhi to lose(even though he lost last year) to continue proving that he didn't carry and the raptors were actually loaded. It's kinda petty. If Kawhi played for my team and I had no dog in the playoffs and I'm a raptors fan, I would cheer for Kawhi, but that's just me.  &gt;As for the point regarding the hate towards Clippers... I dunno, but I think its pretty obvious that Clippers being pretty underwhelming in the playoffs so far is more on their organization than on Kawhi, so it doesn't really prove anything for those people, unless their point is solely that Raptors are much more competent franchise in which case I might agree regardless of the Clippers' struggles... or you know it's just some random salty dudes that every fanbase has regardless of success.  I can agree on that, but some fans aren't logical. Sports is filled with emotional fans that lead with emotions rather than logic.  One example of this is fans on any team board blaming the refs for a loss and the ref conspired against their team. Refs do fuck up, ref missed calls. I don't believe by some miracle every ref has something against everyone's favorite team in the league and wants to see them lose.  &gt;Kinda off-topic, but hypothetically speaking this Clippers team might look a lot better if they somehow got Kawhi the year Raptors did. Where Raptors already had a pretty solid team from top to bottom and a good combination of youth and vets that Kawhi fit into perfectly, the Clippers would've benefited a lot from having that one year of being able to evaluate their roster/coaching strengths and weakness without the pressure of having to 'win now'.  I do think they got something pretty close to the kawhi from the raptors, even in the bubble. He had a bad game 7 but that run was still  a great run. He averaged 30 against dallas year on high efficiency too.  https://twitter.com/FlyByKnite/status/1301716755761393664  I think the issue clippers have that the raptors or san antonio have is they don't get Kawhi the ball consistently when its game winning time. Lou, Trezz rather take shots away from Leonard, thinking they are equal footing than just give it to kawhi.  Here's trezz he has kawhi wide open and rather challenge jokic. He did that all series pretty much.  https://twitter.com/TheJesseBeer/status/1304645715595898880  This year, its similar but not as bad as last year. They''ll take illadvise threes instead of giving it to Kawhi to make a play. Last night they needed it, and it happened. Kawhi is not exactly vocal about yo, give me the ball and get out of my way. He didn't have to do that for toronto, because toronto begged him to do it. Pop yelled at the team to do the same, give the ball to kawhi. Clippers don't have that presence."
"That was undoubtedly impressive as well, close with Kawhi. 19 Kawhi did have better teammates than 03 Duncan, however, Duncan's teammates played above their true skill and Kawhi's didn't.   So for that fact I'd say Kawhi still carried harder, as he won both the Philly and Bucks series all by himself, though the GS finals series he had more help. But if you wanna say Duncan, I won't argue too hard, and putting yourself in a category with Jordan and Duncan isn't a slight on what Kawhi did at all.   If anything it bolsters his case because it's like once a decade a player goes off like that, and the only times it's happened in 30 years puts him in a class with the GOAT and a top 8 GOAT. Great company to be in.  That said, fuck Kawhi Leonard as great as he is, and GO MAVS!"
"&gt; he‚Äôs playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."

Kawhi Anthony Leonard
Kawhi Leonard exists
"You‚Äôre wrong  He thought about retiring but didn‚Äôt because he wanted to threepeat, it wasn‚Äôt until his dad was murderd until he decided to do so ‚ÄúShaken and disillusioned by the murder of his father and an NBA investigation into allegations of illegal betting (of which he was eventually cleared), Jordan announced his retirement from basketball in 1993.‚Äù   And the ‚Äúyou lose some hunger and some edge‚Äùquote, he is saying that he was so dominant that there wasn‚Äôt really any competition, he went on to play another sport because he wasn‚Äôt afraid of the challenge. Also he came and threepeated a second time( and somehow he‚Äôs not a competitor?). Also also many people believed that the bulls would have won 8 consecutive times had he not retire, so there‚Äôs that.   We all know how great defensively Scottie was and Rodman being a rebound machine... let‚Äôs start off with pippin, he came in after Jordan was establishing himself, Scottie was Jordan‚Äôs sidekick and a pretty great one at that...Lebron was dwayne wades sidekick, wade had already won a ring, bronny boy had to ‚Äúlearn to become a champion‚Äù... Jordan learned by doing it, hence why he was finals MVP for all six finals.... as for Rodman? He came in after Jordan already threepeated.  Do you really want to talk about which guy cried the most when Jordan was in a era where you could clothesline a guy for a block, while queen James cries every damn time he goes to the rim and doesn‚Äôt get a call because someone barely touches him... also do we you need to see a video compilation of all the terrible flops Lebron does?   When did Jordan get swept in the finals? I missed it... also you comparing MJ in the toughest conference for his whole career, making it to the playoffs his first 3 years in which the second year he got hurt and the team that beat him twice went on to win those finals. Yet he still managed to get 6 rings...to Lebron playing in the softest conference almost his entire career, lost to to Washington his fist year and they didn‚Äôt go to the finals, 2nd year got swept his fist time against the Spurs and loses to Boston twice and the Magic‚Äôs, had to leave town because he couldn‚Äôt handle losing and ran to daddy wades arms to save his career..and only managing 3 rings and 6 finals loses?  Again... he joined the lakers in 2019 yes, and the plan was waiting for AD to leave New Orleans, hell he even tried to recruit kawhi leonard, to further stack his team.  You telling me during the 2018-2020 years AD wasn‚Äôt in the talks of being a top 5 player?  Me calling Lebron a bitch, is me calling him out on how he acts... which is like a bitch.  Again questioning MJs mental toughness?  How does that quote make him weak? Because he shared how he felt after criticism about his gambling? (not criticism as a player or his skill or he‚Äôs decision as a player)... even then, any criticism against him he uses it as fuel to become better and to be as great as as he is. So yeah, that‚Äôs being mentally tough. Lebron sees his team losing and he walks out of the game with time still on the board... blames his team when shit hits the fan...plays half ass defense... not shaking hands with the suns after getting knocked out of the playoffs...constantly making excuses to make himself look good.   Yeah you try to control the narrative, and have such a terrible take by saying Jordan isn‚Äôt mentally tough and competitive... even In The Last Dance you see him playing the security guard quarters until he was able to beat him and dominate him. When he couldn‚Äôt beat Detroit, he worked his ass off to become tougher so that he could beat them...which he did. Lebron went against  KD and the warriors and failed and the next time he went against them failed again with his second finals sweep."
"Yesterday I used this: https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kawhi-leonard-playoff-stats-2021  Which isn't really an actual source but yeah I wanted more internet points u got me. Isn't that why anyone posts on this website? I just want people to talk about Kawhi Leonard, dude had one of the greatest elimination performances I've ever seen and it wasn't even that hyped  I deleted it before I posted this lol"
"&gt;	Jordan‚Äôs first retirement was because his father was killed and he went on to pursue baseball because it was his fathers dream that he played baseball  Nope. Jordan made his decision to retire prior to his fathers passing.   He even said this in 1992  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna shock the world.. I‚Äôm gonna quit and go play baseball. I‚Äôd do it now, but magic and bird never 3 peat. If it wasn‚Äôt for that, id be playing this summer‚Äù  Also he told his dad he was gonna retire, he said only him and his dad knew.   &gt;	because he‚Äôs a competitor and loves the game of basketball  Really? Cuz he literally said this after 1993  ‚ÄúPhysically, I was getting exhausted... but, mentally, I was way past exhausted. When you try to do something repetitively, **you lose some of the hunger and some of the edge.**  So wrong again.   &gt;	 as for Lebron maybe established isn‚Äôt the right word, stacked team would be a better term  You need to look up who Scottie pippen and Dennis Rodman are. It seems you are unfamiliar with them since you don‚Äôt really know basketball. You should watch the last dance at least.   &gt;	even in the 2016 finals he cried  Crying is what Jordan did to the league about the bad boys pistons.  &gt;	Got swept out of the buildingby the warriors  Like how Jordan got swept by the Celtics because he couldn‚Äôt handle bird.   &gt;	Don‚Äôt play dumb we talking about the 2020 lakers, not the 2019 lakers  But LeBron joined the lakers in 2019 not 2020.   Don‚Äôt play dumb and try back tracking now. You said he joins stacked super teams, so now the 2019 lakers are a super team?  &gt;	the team that has a top 5 player (AD)  This is why it‚Äôs important to actually watch basketball. Before AD being traded to the lakers, the top players in the league were LeBron, steph, kd, Giannis, harden, and Kawhi Leonard. All these players were ahead of AD. And now just because the lakers traded for him, you want to elevate him to top 5 because he‚Äôs on lebrons team? Lmao that‚Äôs like saying Scottie pippen was top 5. Don‚Äôt play dumb.   &gt;	Yeah I know my history   You literally don‚Äôt have any history, you literally just posted memes. You don‚Äôt follow basketball, you follow basketball memes.   &gt;	and I know my history of Lebron being a bitch who isn‚Äôt mentally tough  Calling LeBron a bitch because of how insecure you are lmao. Mentally tough is what Jordan said:  ‚Äú My fame is... it was good in the beginning. Any time people talk about you in a positive way, yeah, it‚Äôs great to hear those comments, **but how that you are on a pedestal, it‚Äôs not just the positive talking that you hear. You hear some points and some people taking shots at you**, and that really changes the whole idea of being out there for people to see you...‚Äù  So not only was he mentally weak here but he also said:  ‚Äúso I‚Äôm at that stage in my career and my life that I‚Äôd rather get behind closed doors than to be out there in the spotlight to be taking shots from everyone‚Äù   Mentally weak and not competitive.   Like I said, you don‚Äôt follow basketball, you follow basketball memes.   &gt;	which is why he and his fans are always trying to control the narrative like how you are trying to do.  Lmao which is hilarious cuz you as a Jordan stan (the ones who never saw him play and just post memes) created this false narrative right here.   Go do some research and study, and next time come with actual facts."
Kawhi Leonard.  Killing blue and red bball teams sicne birth
"Kawhi ""Micheal Jeffery Jordan"" Leonard."
"Issue was is that he sat but Paul George and Kawhi Leonard didn't, which is why they got the run and came back to down 1 at the end of the first quarter.  Sure it's still game 3 but Rick gotta know the stakes on the CLippers end. It's a must win game.  Give Doncic a rest when at least one of the two sit out."
"Yeah ofc not the same because of his knees, but Kawhi harassed Luka almost the entire game. Luka didn't try shooting against Kawhi until the very end when the game was over. Luka is so insane that Kawhi is the only defender that holds Luka to under 40%. For comparison, Luka is 50% or so against PG. The fact that Luka isn't confident shooting against Leonard speaks volumes but I guess not everyone understands what defense is"
He‚Äôs still Kawhi Leonard
Kawhi Leonard.
Kawhi Leonard but Luka isn't that far off and will surpass him in a year or two.
"&gt;The whole problem with last night is kawhi went god mode and our team mostly didn‚Äôt show up, and it was still close (my homer take is that if a couple more players show up we can win in game 7).  On the other hand, the best three-point shooting team in history went stone cold and shot like 15% -- other than Leonard.  If that doesn't happen, it's not even a close game.  As a neutral observer, Dallas is better than I thought, but the Clippers have helped them out a lot in the series -- both with Lue's ""coaching""* and with some aspects of their play.  *I use this term loosely, since I am not totally sure the Clippers have a coach. Their play does not reflect the presence of one."
"Why does Portland simply not acquire kawhi Leonard, maybe someone should tell the front office thatd make them better."
May be a better way to phrase it would be which draft bust would have been a better/star player if drafted by a better organization.    May be Kawhi Leonard &amp; Tim Duncan are not as good if drafted by the Sacramento kings.    May be Kwame has a better career if he had been drafted by the spurs.
"Yeah, weird to act like that doesn‚Äôt matter while seeing Luka carve up a team with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard."
hes not a kawhi stopper. fin smith is better. kleb is still better than having luka on him. kleb can at least somewhat force Leonard to take a tougher shot. it's just that now kawhi has figured out how to get to his spots with switching
Kawhi Leonard heard Stephen A Smith run his mouth üëÄ

Kawhi Leonard who are you man?
"it‚Äôs hard to defend a team playing 5 40%+ 3pt shooters basically always on the floor and then also kawhi leonard and paul george, I think we would look much better defensively against literally any other team in the west"
Kawhi Leonard
do tim duncan &amp; kawhi leonard actually like basketball?
Kawhi Leonard.
KAWHI FREAKING LEONARD
Kawhi Leonard played his best defensive game all series. And where is Hardaway?
"From my experience these last two playoffs, it is my understanding that Kawhi Leonard does not miss shots."
Kawhi Leonard first half shooting this series  * Game 1 - 5/10 * Game 2 - 10/14 * Game 3 - 8/9 * Game 4 - 8/10  shooting percentage in first halves so far 31/43 = 72%  not too shabby
Kawhi Leonard was at San Diego state and didn‚Äôt know how to shoot when he was RJ‚Äôs age.
They also were shooting lights out the first two games. I think they are somewhere in between the two. Which I don‚Äôt think is enough to beat a Kawhi Leonard team
"**Most recent championship runs**  Kevin Durant averaged 29.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists on 49/34/90 in 21 games in the 2018 playoffs.

He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  -------  **Most recent playoff runs**   Kawhi Leonard averaged 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds and 5.5 assists on 49/33/86 in 13 games in the 2020 playoffs.

He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  --------   Keep in mind here that Kawhi's stats are similar, arguably better (depending on what you value), without being on a superteam or even having a fellow superstar on his team (in my opinion, Paul George is borderline, not a superstar but a star. If you think he's a superstar, that's fine, but he's undeniably worse than Curry/AD. KD and LeBron have had better teams around them than Kawhi has). Kawhi's Raptors/Clippers supporting cast pale in comparison to LeBron's Cavs/Heat/Lakers and KD's Thunder/Warriors/Nets.   Again, everything except the stats are OPINIONS, and I have my own, and you can have your own. Please stop following me around and being weird about this. It's just basketball man"

Future warrior kawhi Leonard :)
Kawhi Leonard
"I was playing 2k and the commentator says ""if I'm coaching Hunter I'm having him do one thing, and that's watching tape of Kawhi Leonard! That's whose build and play style he resembles the most that's the type of player he can be. "" the comparison made me laugh. It also said his handles have been what he's improves the most lol"
"Yes, the Lakers wanting to sign the Toronto Raptors Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard is a perfect example of them being obsessed with the Clippers."
"Great, having a third option that‚Äôs also an allstar opens up the floor for you immensely lol. He was on a team with 2 allstars with no expectations where he could just let them lead the way.   Again, you would‚Äôve never said this 4 games ago, so chances are you shouldn‚Äôt let 4 games completely change your opinion. That‚Äôs why people say this sub is so reactionary, you would‚Äôve been laughed at before the playoffs if you said Siakam was better than Randle.   That championship run is wholly irrelevant in the conversation. Put Julius Randle on a team with Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry, they‚Äôd be just as good lol"
Off season targets: 1. Rim protector 2. Kawhi Leonard
Embiid and Jokic definitely better than Kawhi too  Not sure there‚Äôs a single star who rides reputation and circumstance harder than Mr Leonard
Westbrook as your third best player is much different than being your 1st or 2nd best.  Especially when one of the other guys is Kawhi Leonard.
"Kawhi Leonard averaged 12.5 drives per game during the regular season. Paul George averaged 11.8. They're averaging 17.3 and 15.3, respectively, through three games in the postseason. George is shooting 81% on drives against Dallas."
