I get huge Malcolm Brogdon vibes for him. A guy who‚Äôs just safe and in control. Probably won‚Äôt give you 30 a night but he will never lose you the game with bad shots or turnovers
&gt; looks like they‚Äôre not exerting much effort  This describes Malcolm Brogdon as well.
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS‚ñº|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.
Can't believe no one mentioned Malcolm Brogdon. He's top 5 of this list.
"&gt;ESPN‚Äôs Bobby Marks took a look at the extensions that were and weren‚Äôt handed out on Monday and offered some analysis on Ball‚Äôs situation. Marks cited a pair of recent contracts as barometers for Ball heading into contract negotiations.  &gt;‚ÄúIf Ball stays healthy and plays at a high level this season, a new contract should start in the $16-18 million range next offseason, similar to the Hornets‚Äô Terry Rozier and Spurs‚Äô Dejounte Murray (keep in mind that the $16.8 million salary this season of teammate Eric Bledsoe ranks No. 22 among all point guards). The high end for Ball would be the four-year, $80 million contract that Malcolm Brogdon signed with the Indiana Pacers in 2019.‚Äù  This was written back in November before Giannis resigned with the bucks. A lot of teams were preserving cap space for next summer and now whats left?   Its obvious that a lot of you let your emotion cloud your judgement with contracts. Your opinion on lonzo are irrelevant, if he rediscovers his 3 ball then he will be highly sought after next summer. Someone is going to pay him big money."
Malcolm Brogdon - yes  -   &gt; Especially when there are other players PUTTING UP BETTER STATS WITH WINNING RECORDS.  Gordon Hayward and Julius Randle are both on teams with losing records
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"I don‚Äôt even think he is the favorite üòÇ. J think Haliburton could get a Malcolm Brogdon win. If Wiseman keeps up his recent play he can easily win, same for Edwards, same for Quickley."
"You can have 6 guards, but he's also not making it over Ben Simmons.  #1 seed and defense have to mean something.  EDIT: or Malcolm Brogdon"
"Except in the years where guys like Malcolm Brogdon or MCW won it, you are mostly right.   However I think it‚Äôs very possible Tyrese wins in a similar fashion as the guys I mentioned above, unless Wiseman/Melo/Edwards suddenly start putting up a lot more numbers.  It‚Äôs also still a totally open race tbh, by no means is this me trying to say Tyrese SHOULD win, I‚Äôm just saying he should rightfully be in the conversation."

I‚Äôm on record back during free agency a couple years ago that I would much rather have had Malcolm Brogdon than kemba. The only ‚Äúundersized‚Äù point guard that would work with this starting 5 is steph curry
"Vucevic is a good one, but when everyone says Malcolm Brogdon is underrated and a lot of people argue he should be an allstar, he‚Äôs not underrated anymore. I think the majority of people know how good Boucher is too."
Ok?  and I‚Äôm still taking Victor Oladipo over Malcolm Brogdon.

I don‚Äôt watch hoops because I like Oladipo over Malcolm Brogdon?
Malcolm Brogdon got my vote
"I actually wouldn't be opposed to leaving LaVine off. I'm usually against empty stats guys, but I don't think that accurately describes LaVine this season. I think of ""empty stats"" as guys who just score a ton at below average efficiency. LaVine's shooting numbers are crazy though, and he has improved a good amount on defense. I'm less impressed with LaVine than the average fan though, that's for sure.  -  What about Malcolm Brogdon though? He's who I'd *actually* advocate for as an All-Star in that last slot.  Basic:  * Brogdon: 22.8 pts / 4.3 reb / 7.1 ast / 1.4 stl / 0.2 blk / 2.1 TO on .459/.413/.905 shooting * Harris: 20.1 pts / 6.7 reb / 2.8 ast / 0.9 stl / 0.9 blk / 2.4 TO on .525/.461/.821 shooting  Advanced:  * Brogdon: 2.2 WS (.158 WS/48) / 3.7 BPM / 0.9 VORP / 1.99 RPM * Harris: 1.5 WS (.134 WS/48) / 2.6 BPM / 0.6 VORP / 2.03 RPM  Pacers are only 1.5 games behind Philadelphia and have the same Net Rating. Brogdon has a higher usage than Harris and doesn't have a top MVP candidate next to him. The Sixers roster overall probably has more raw talent than Indiana. Just feels like Brogdon is doing more with less."
Malcolm Brogdon deserves to make it. He's been great.
If your measure of ability is efficiency then DeAndre Jordan is the best player in the NBA...  Trae Young TS%: 57.8%  Malcolm Brogdon TS%: 57.6%  Now please tell me who is more efficient??? You are a casual that doesn‚Äôt understand how the game is played.
I would like to start my campaign by saying that both Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner definitely deserve all-star spots.   Malcolm Brogdon should get consideration. Probably either him or Collin Sexton should be the last guard.
Would a Turner &amp; Brogdon package plus a pick be enough for Kyrie? I think that would solve rim protection and the fit with Malcolm seems pretty good next to Harden/KD. How is Brogdon defensively though? Haven‚Äôt been able to watch him play too much.  Edit: this is a hypothetical before I get roasted
"Is Malcolm Brogdon an all star?That‚Äôs like asking if bald eagles cry freedom, or if the pacers drink soft water. Malcom brogdon is the ideal male form. I already have his picture pinned on my fridge so that every time I pull out a meal I know it is served to me in a smooth and silky fashion. Malcolm brogdon isn‚Äôt so fast, how about you not so fast you filthy casual. Malcolm brogdon is a wizard and a wizard arrives on defense precisely when he means to. Not only did Malcolm brogdon just knock down that free throw, but he also just knocked up my mom and I‚Äôve never been more grateful.

"Someone like a Malcolm Brogdon would be perfect for the Bucks, anyone know how they can get their hands on him??"
"Malcolm Brogdon!! Career levels of production on a winning team, 2 (!) OT game winners this year. I could see him over LaVine, especially looking at the winning aspect."

"Fwiw, Brogdon really didn‚Äôt seem to like Milwaukee all that much, [based off his comments on it](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2824568-malcolm-brogdon-on-milwaukee-ive-never-lived-in-a-city-this-segregated)(the city, not the team).   It could have been that the Bucks wanted to keep him, but didn‚Äôt want to keep a player that didn‚Äôt want to be there."
"In 2017, the only rookie that looked like they had star potential was a Joel Embiid that only played 31 games due to injury.  Malcolm Brogdon won Rookie of the Year averaging 10 points and 4 assists per game."
Malcolm Brogdon won Rory with 10/2/4 averages. Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram failed to score in double digits that same season so that 2017 rookie class comes to mind.

Malcolm Brogdon is all star now
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
Brogdon can play the 2!  PG: Dame / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell  SG: Malcolm Brogdon / Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Justin Holiday / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Doug McDermott / Melo  C: Sabonis / Kanter / Giles   We couldn't anchor the paint to save our lives but hey we can surround Sabonis with shooters.

"if there was a ""hes actually still better than you think he his"" award in the NBA, it would go to malcolm brogdon for sure"
"Guards that come into the NBA at an older age (after their junior or senior seasons in college) adapt quicker, like Donovan Mitchell, Malcolm Brogdon, and Damian Lillard. Most guards that leave after their freshman year in college take a while to hit their stride because they aren't as physically mature, the point guard position is in a golden age in the NBA with a lot of good/great veterans, and they don't know the tricks older players do"
"Malcolm Brogdon, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavine, Zion Williamson - not necessarily role players but none of them have been all stars (yet)."
Malcolm Brogdon  KCP  Joe Harris  PJ Tucker    Brogdon isn‚Äôt really a role player but if he doesn‚Äôt have some decent offensive guard then no Shaq team is winning shit
This makes sense for the Pacers.  Caris LeVert will be able to find her place alongside Malcolm Brogdon.
They'll be very good when they get TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb back. Caris Levert is going to fit in nicely. I think Oladipo had some chemistry issues. He still thought he was the man even though he wasn't. Malcolm Brogdon is officially the leader of this team now.
"You read my post, right? I addressed that.  Bucks got rid of Malcolm Brogdon who's an even better player than Ariza. Does anyone know the Bucks owner's name?"
"Surprised that Malcolm brogdon is higher then lillard, young, and especially harden"
"Vic takes more shots, but I‚Äôd definitely say Brogdon is the better player at this point.  So the Pacers top 2 would obviously be 1. TJ McConnell 2. Malcolm Brogdon."
"Everyone is. Why do people keep doing stuff like this. ‚ÄúWhy is no one talking about how good Gordon Hayward has been‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy is no one talking about how bad the Raptors offense has been, it‚Äôs becoming a problem.‚Äù Literally everyone is talking about this stuff. Malcolm Brogdon gets three posts about him a day."
"&gt;You can't be serious. That was a sign-and-trade.   &gt;   &gt;Malcolm Brogdon   &gt;   &gt;Another sign and trade. You kind of suck at this.  What difference are you proposing that makes?  They were still traded cheaply.  &gt;That was for a massive TPE.  Which you get when you pay a team two second-round picks to take an expensive player off your hands.  &gt;And they weren't trading for one season of AD like the Celtics would have been. He made it clear he wanted to be in LA and didn't want to be in Boston.  No, he didn't make it clear that he wanted to be in Los Angeles, and as recently as a couple weeks ago, was still mulling whether or not to re-sign, and for how long.  If James had played like a typical 36 year-old Hall of Famer -- which is to say not very well -- and the Lakers bowed out of the playoffs early, Davis was quite likely gone.  Boston could've taken that gamble, but chose not to."
"&gt;Butler was traded straight-up for Josh Richardson.  You can't be serious. That was a sign-and-trade.  &gt;Malcolm Brogdon  Another sign and trade. You kind of suck at this.  &gt;the Celtics are paying Charlotte two seconds just to take Hayward off their hands.  That was for a massive TPE.  &gt;you can't whine about the Lakers being willing to trade Ingram ( and four other players, plus picks ) for one season of Davis   I haven't whined about the Lakers. And they weren't trading for one season of AD like the Celtics would have been. He made it clear he wanted to be in LA and didn't want to be in Boston."
"&gt;None of those guys were gettable without at least one of Tatum/Brown.  Butler was traded straight-up for Josh Richardson.  Not on that list, but Malcolm Brogdon was traded for a late-first, and two future seconds.  Meanwhile, the Celtics are paying Charlotte two seconds just to take Hayward off their hands.  Finally, you can't whine about the Lakers being willing to trade Ingram ( and four other players, plus picks ) for one season of Davis if you're not willing to take the same risk."
"&gt; Brogdon didnt even wanna be in Milwaukee  Nah, I know that's the narrative everyone wants to believe but it's not true - what really happened is Bucks ownership decided Brogdon wasn't worth paying, which is insane but it's the truth. I mean, [Brogdon is on record saying he would have stayed but we didn't want him](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/indiana-pacers-malcolm-brogdon-wanted-stay-milwaukee-bucks-team-didnt-want-him-trade-034217867.html)."

Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon have to get a 3rd team consideration with the start to the year they've had.

The guy has been slaying for me in fantasy. Him and Malcolm Brogdon.
"Last season had a lot of players make it for the first time, it seems unlikely to have a bunch more again  But actually projecting, not just based on season so far  West:   Projected: None  Contenders: CJ McCollum, Zion, Murray, Wood  CJ has been playing really well, but I'm not highly confident that at 29 he'll suddenly maintain the kind of shooting he's had so far. Zion has been playing well, but will need to be even better to have a chance, especially with Ingram on his team. Murray has also been playing really well, but guards have a lot of competition and I'm just not sure if it's enough, especially with another better all-star player on his team. Wood has the numbers, and if Harden leaves he has a good chance, but if he's still there I wouldn't bet on it   East:   Projected: Jaylen Brown, Malcolm Brogdon  Jaylen is playing fantastically, and without Kemba I think he'll get a lot of credit. Brogdon is also playing very well on the new Pacers, who are also playing very well. Jaylen is a much more clear pick than Brogdon  Contenders: Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant  I think all three (especially Randle) are playing above their weight at the moment, the Knicks won't maintain anything like the 6th seed, and the Pistons suck. But it is the east and there seem like clear spots to be won, and they all have great 3 number splits so I could easily see at least one of them getting a spot"
"Malcolm Brogdon, the worst ROTY ever, averaged 10/2/4 and started just 28 games for the season when he won."
"Victor Oladipo yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Myles Turner gave a look of pleasant surprise. Domantas Sabonis belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Malcolm Brogdon hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different despite appearing the same.‚Äù"
"They're idiots.  Tony Bennet is one of best scouting coaches in CBB in terms of id'ing talent others overlook and he said Hunter had not even scratched the surface of his potential when he was drafted.  Reminder he recruited Klay Thompson, Joe Harris and Malcolm Brogdon."
"A stellar performance from Malcolm Brogdon, who is playing like an All Star these last few games. Vic didn't have a great shooting night but he was still aggressive and made the effort on offense. Myles Turner continued his epic defensive run to start the season with 8 blocks, including a clutch collab block with Sabonis in the last minute of the game which helped us seal the win.   The Pacers were able to weather the storm each time the Rockets were able to close the gap after the Pacers had built a lead. John Wall was unstoppable, and he got to the rim with ease all night and was getting basically any layup he wanted. This surely would have been a different game if not for Harden's frankly terrible (by Harden standards) performance. There was no aggression from him and he took very few of those stepback threes you expect to see him take, although he did finish with 12 assists. We had 3 or 4 guys defending him all night, so those different defensive looks may have confused him or disrupted his scoring game, but I think he just didn't have it going for whatever reason last night. The Rockets bench also played very poorly.   The Pacers' biggest issue right now is rebounding. They are not a good rebounding team, and they especially give up way too many offensive boards. That is not sustainable for the season and isn't a playoff-winning formula, so they will have to get that sorted out. The Pacers rebounded better against the Rockets, but they played a team which is also a bad rebounding team, and the Rockets also used a small-ball lineup all night which may have had something to do with the Pacers' better rebounding performance.   All in all, things are going really well for the Pacers at the moment. They're winning games, and they're doing it while still missing some key players in TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb. Doug McDermott, who has been really productive at times for us, also went out injured on Wednesday. Despite our injuries, our starters are lighting it up with great performances, bolstered by role players stepping up on any given night, like Justin Holiday, who finished with 20 points last night."

"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
Malcolm Brogdon
"Buddy Hield is the guy we thought who Malcolm Brogdon was.  Scratch that, Hield was born 6 days later than Brogdon."
"Finally someone said it, I remember seeing MB for Mikal Bridges as if there isn‚Äôt multiple people in the league with those initials (Miles Bridges, Malcolm Brogdon, Marvin Bagley, ETC)"
My vote is for Malcolm Brogdon.
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
How do you feel about Malcolm Brogdon being on your corner now?

"&gt;Thinking the Lakers had they not brought in LeBron would be a playoff team in the West is preposterous.  It's not remotely.  They were 12 games out of playoff spot in 2018 -- starting two 20 year-olds, and one each 22, 23, and 24.  Only 1 player over 25 played over 700 minutes for that team -- Brook Lopez.  That was one of the youngest NBA teams in recent history, when weighted by minutes-played.  They were barely older than a college team.  They also had 20 year-old Ivica Zubac and 20 year-old Thomas Bryant.  They traded Zubac to make room for Davis, and he immediately started for the playoff-bound Clippers.  Bryant is starting in Washington -- who are not a playoff team, but he'd certainly be a capable backup.  They also would've had plenty of cap space to re-sign Brook Lopez, who is also capable of starting on a playoff team.  Plus Ingram, Randle, Ball, Caldwell-Pope, Hart, Kuzma, Caruso, Clarkson, and Hunter -- all guys currently playing well for various teams.  Or, they could package some of those assets -- with the 3 firsts and second round picks they used on Davis -- to acquire other players.  For just two examples, they had more disposable assets than Miami needed to trade for Jimmy Butler and still had more than Indiana needed to trade for Malcolm Brogdon.  Just to name two very good players who have recently been on the trade market for much, much less than the Lakers spent on one season of Davis.  They were on their way back to playoffs, even without James -- exactly because of the original topic here, they drafted very well year after year, and that left them with a wealth of young assets."
"&gt;Lebrun + 7 PJ Tuckers is enough to win a ring.   You realize he averages like 7 points a game right? Is Lebron going to average 50?  It needs to be someone who can handle the ball and score on his own a little to take the load off Bron, and also play switchy defense. Malcolm Brogdon perhaps?"
Brogdon played well. Shot lights out and beat Payton off the Dribble all night. The game came down to second unit. Pacers couldn't hang without Malcolm
Malcolm ‚Äúdespite the loss‚Äù Brogdon
"https://www.talkbasket.net/62113-malcolm-brogdon-says-he-would-have-stayed-with-milwaukee-if-they-had-wanted-me      &gt;‚ÄúI would‚Äôve loved to play for this team, if they had wanted me,‚Äù Brogdon told reporters before the Pacers‚Äô 117-89 loss. ‚ÄúIf they had valued me the way the Pacers value me. That‚Äôs all I gotta say.‚Äù"
*Ben Simmons/Malcolm Brogdon didn‚Äôt like that*
I've never heard of this Brog-DAN.  Personally I've always thought that the 2md round draft pick by the bucks Malcolm Brogdon was always underrated.
"They need Mikal Bridges and Malcolm Brogdon, run those guys out there with Doncic, KP &amp; Klieber and they'd be unstoppable"
I really hope he doesn't become our Malcolm Brogdon. We really need to lock him up asap for the long term.
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
And he‚Äôs almost as good as Malcolm Brogdon
"&gt;thinking they win without the 2nd best player in the playoffs is just a bit absurd.   It's not remotely.  Offensively, Ingram alone replaces almost all of Davis' production, and the team would be by-far the deepest in the league.  &gt; You're overestimating current bron's carrying abilities thinking he wins a title with ingram, lonzo, kuzma etc and I'm high on him.  James has won with less, against better competition.  Who beats James, Ingram, Ball, Kuzma, Zubac plus Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner last year?  And that's assuming the Lakers don't use the pile of assets they burned to rent Davis on other upgrades.  They easily could've afforded Jimmy Butler and/or Malcolm Brogdon -- both of whom were traded for peanuts compared to Davis.  James, Butler, Ball, Ingram, Zubac with Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner wins last year easily. No one in the east could beat Butler + Adebayo, so they sure as hell are not beating Butler + James + Ingram. No in the west came close to the Lakers either, and this team is better.   &gt; Also the lakers were in a sizable playoff slump pre AD.   And will be in one again if he only plays 19 lackluster games per season.  Good thing they traded a decade of assets to rent him for one season, eh?"
"If not for the Malcolm Brogdon trade, there wouldn‚Äôt be a 2020 Pacers 1st round pick for the Bucks to trade for Jrue Holiday."
I still can't believe you guys let go of malcolm brogdon wtffff
Malcolm Brogdon Paul Millsap Trae Young Tyrese Haliburton Marc Gasol  Winning type unathletic players
"1. Domantas Sabonis (best, not most valuable) 2. Myles Turner 3. Caris LeVert 4. Malcolm Brogdon 5. T.J. McConnell 6. Justin Holiday 7. Doug McDermott 8. **Edmond Sumner** 9. **Goga Bitadze** 10. Jeremy Lamb 11. Aaron Holiday"
You remember how FVV basically launched his career by cooking us that series? And how terrible Malcolm is at getting over screens when he‚Äôs defending smaller guards?  Those two facts are completely unrelated!  In all seriousness we likely would not have Holiday if we had kept Brogdon so at the end of the day we‚Äôre better off for having let him walk.
Both are Malcolm Brogdon facts
"No, he likely didn't.  The Lakers last year could have been James, Ball, Ingram, Kuzma, Zubac with Green, Hart, Hunter, Howard, Caruso, McGee, Morris, Rondo, Caldwell-Pope, Wagner, or something off the bench.  That team is ridiculously deep, and more than good enough to win.    They also could have traded for, say, Jimmy Butler and/or Malcolm Brogdon without using even half of the assets they blew on renting Davis.  And adding Butler to that team makes them the certain champions.  No one in the East last year could be Butler and Adebayo, so they've no chance against James+Butler+Ingram.  No one in the West threatened the Lakers, either, so they wouldn't beat either of these squads."
"Everyone treats Haliburton like he's an elder rookie, it's bizarre to me. Like he's a low ceiling kind of guy coming out of 4 years at college. He was basically dead average in terms of age of rookies drafted, but the 1st round skews a little younger.  People always bring up Malcolm Brogdon which *kind of* makes sense in play style, but there's always an ""old rookie"" subtext to it. Haliburton at his debut was over 3 years younger than Brodgon at his debut.   Some previous rookies who were treated as young guys with high potential that were actually older than Haliburton when they were drafted: PJ Washington, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Jackson, Robert Williams"
"Bucks gotta be my pick.  - Draft Joel Embiid in 2014 (over Jabari Parker)  - Draft Domantas Sabonis in 2016 (over Thon Maker)  - Draft Norman Powell and OG Anunoby (with the picks they traded for Greivis Vazquez)  - Hold onto Malcolm Brogdon (instead of letting him go to the Pacers)  That's a lineup of: Brogdon / Middleton / Anunoby / Antetokounmpo / Embiid, which Powell &amp; Sabonis off the bench."
"I've seen it frequently commented on this sub where people say ""Haliburton is having the better rookie season and should be ROTY, but I'd take Edwards long-term"" -- why??  I get that Edwards has *fLaShEs* but Haliburton is better at almost everything on the court. He's a better shooter, a better finisher, a better passer, a better defender, a better PnR player, he absolutely demolishes Edwards across the board in basketball IQ. Edwards is (much) more athletic and younger, people are swept on on the tools and potential when Haliburton has some great potential himself. And Edwards isn't eve THAT much younger -- 17 months. It's not like Haliburton is some Malcolm Brogdon 23 year old rookie, he just plays with the polish of an older rookie.  Haliburton plays off-ball more while Edwards has a higher usage, but I don't necessarily see that as a plus for Edwards. Haliburton will be an elite swiss army knife that can play next to anyone in the backcourt, while Edwards projects to be a low efficiency volume scorer who probably will always have to play next to a good defensive guard.  In a redraft I'd absolutely go with LaMelo #1 and Haliburton #2."
Malcolm Brogdon 2.0
"My likely projection for Haliburton is something along the lines of a better version of Malcolm Brogdon. They've similar players, but Tyrese is better at 20 years old than Brogdon was at 25.  Another comp I really like was Mike Conley combined with Doug Christie"
"Sure, but he said Hali would be the ""worst ROTY of the last 30 years"", not that Hali would not win it due to low PPG.  Hali is undoutebly a better rookie than MCW, arguably Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon. Calling him the ""worst ROTY of the past 30 years"" is straight up disrespectful"
"My 5 favorite players are all on the Jazz, so just for fun, I'll compose my team from other franchises:  PG: Raul Neto   SG: Ricky Rubio   SF: Malcolm Brogdon   PF: Giannis Antetokoumpo   C: Steven Adams  Greek Freak carries this team to a playoff position in the East, but there's probably not enough shooting for a playoff run."
Malcolm Brogdon put up 10/3/4 on 56 ts%  Hali is putting up 13/3/5 on 61 ts%
Kind of reminds me of Malcolm Brogdon when he came into the league. I wanted the Bucks to draft Desmond Bane too lol

"Silly argument, you can replace Gobert with Embiid and the Jazz would get better just like how you can replace Mitchell with Harden, Kyrie etc.  Point I‚Äôm trying to make is that Mitchell is still really important to the team, and I don‚Äôt think the Jazz are as good if you replace Mitchell with say Jrue Holliday or Malcolm Brogdon."
Malcolm Brogdon is BUTT CHEEKS
"Why would Edwards efficiency go down with a less demanding role?    Typically increased volume means worse efficiency.   Put Halliburton in the Wolves and he would be struggling with his efficiency. Put Edwards on the Kings and he would be doing better with his efficiency.   At this point it feels like you are just changing the argument since you found out 17 ppg as a rookie is actually impressive.  However using Halliburton (who is considered 2nd in the ROY race) as an example to why Edwards doesn‚Äôt deserve ROY is a weird take to be passionate about, as Malcolm Brogdon realistically could have won this ROY race. It‚Äôs just a week year for top end rookie talent."
Malcolm Brogdon.
"No. At 21 ppg, it‚Äôs entirely possible that he may not be the leading scoring on his team. Jamal Murray is close to 21 ppg, but Jokic is the MVP candidate. Middleton is averaging more ppg, yet Giannis is the MVP candidate . Tobias Harris is around 21 ppg, yet Embiid is the MVP candidate.   The player you described could possibly be DeAngelo Russell. If the T‚Äôwolves were 52-30, KAT would be the MVP candidate.   Or it could be Malcolm Brogdon. If the pacers were 52-30, how many people would say it was because of Sabonis?  When the Raptors were a top seed... Kyle Lowry didn‚Äôt get much consideration as an MVP candidate. They looked toward Derozen/Leonard/Siakim as the MVP candidates.   Your player would need to do more...essentially they would HAVE to win the conference with inferior talent... aka CP3 with the hornets, Derrick Rose with the Bulls, Iverson with the 76ers, etc."
It is crazy when he is only 25 and guys like Malcolm Brogdon and Buddy Hield are both 28
"&gt;Lakers don‚Äôt win without trading for AD last year.  That's a very questionable claim.  Without blowing a decade of assets to rent Davis, the Lakers would've had assets to make many other deals.  For example, based on the trades that actually occurred, they could've obtained both Jimmy Butler and Malcolm Brogdon -- and still had many assets leftover.  So if the 2020 Lakers were: James, Caldwell-Pope, Butler, Ingram, Zubac with Ball, Hunter, Hart, Kuzma, McGee, Howard, Caruso, Wagner, Horton-Tucker off the bench, who beats them?  No one in the East last year could beat Butler and Adebayo, so no one is coming close to beating Butler and James.   No one in the West seriously challenged the Lakers last year either, and this team is miles deeper and at least as-good.  Swap in Brogdon, and other teams might have a chance, but the Lakers still do.  Trading a decade of assets to rent one season of Davis was a mistake.  They could've had that roster above and their chances of a 2020 title were just as good.  Then they could've signed Davis in December anyway, if they wanted to, and they'd have an outrageous surplus of players and picks.  They'd have so many assets they'd have to donate half of them charity."
"Lonzo seems to be still on the table for the offseason, but who knows maybe we can find someone even more of a fit for our starting rotation too.  I've seen Malcolm Brogdon tossed around as someone who could be a more developed Lonzo if we are thinking more ""win-now!"" mentality.  I'm excited to see what you guys do with your draft picks and young players!"
That Malcolm Brogdon guy would be helpful
Malcolm Brogdon would be great

everybody except Malcolm Brogdon on both teams didn‚Äôt have more than their C+ game tonight
Has anybody other than Malcolm Brogdon been better than the C+ version of themselves tonight on either team
&gt; Malcolm Brogdon  NANI?!? I thought Broggy was really good?
"He'll have the ball instead of Malcolm Brogdon or Aaron Holiday, I love him already."
"&gt; It makes me feel old when the guy I remember being drafted as the Spanish boy wonder   just do what i do and pound a metamucil then remind yourself he's [only 2 years older than 2017 NBA Rookie of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon] (https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=10&amp;d1=21&amp;y1=1990&amp;m2=12&amp;d2=11&amp;y2=1992&amp;ti=on)"
"**TEAM PACERS (with a twist)**  Billionaire Bruce Wayne sells his corporation and buys an expansion team, complete with an alternate timeline version of the Indiana Pacers.  Current teammates Paul George and Kawhi Leonard prove that -- while social media may hate them right now -- they can fit like a glove on virtually any roster in the league. They provide some excellent perimeter defense that, coupled with Myles Turner, leads these new Pacers to one of the best defensive ratings in the league (finishing # 2 overall.)  Offensively, the team can get caught up in some ""iso ball"" at times, but they manage to get bailed out by Kawhi Leonard's ability to win in those situations. The Pacers end the league year with the # 1 seed out East. The question from here is: will they step up when it counts? Or will PG+Kawhi fold once again?  Round 1 is easy, with the team sweeping the Knicks. In round 2, Boston doesn't provide much more resistance, with another 4-1 win for the Pacers.  The Eastern Conference Finals appear to be more of a challenge, as KD, James Harden, and Kyrie arrive in town ready to test that top-tier defense. Kawhi and Paul George gamely step up their games, but James Harden manages to create some foul trouble for them that limits their minutes. The Nets go up 2-1. Game 4 is even worse, as Kawhi Leonard runs cold and Paul George goes 3-13.  Now down 3-1, it appears as though these Pacers may be folding. However, they do have some aces in the hole: PG Malcolm Brogdon has emerged behind the scenes as a key leader for them, encouraging them to stiffen up and fight their way back into the series. Brogdon even steps up his share of the offense, bullying smaller Kyrie Irving and going for 19-7-8 in a Game 5 win. Kawhi and PG find their rhythm again in Game 6, leading to another win! The team has officially tied it up, 3-3!  Going into a pivotal game 7, everyone looks tight. The offense is slow -- stagnant at times -- and perhaps relying too much on one-on-one play. T.J. Warren tries to do a little too much of that, coughing up 3 turnovers in a game where he should probably be in a background role. In turn, the Nets get hot beyond the arc with Joe Harris hitting 4-7 threes. The Nets end up pulling away and winning this one 115-107.   Afterwards, the Pacers are disappointed, and wonder how much could have changed if they had the full effect of homecourt advantage. Alas, COVID had other plans in mind this particular season."
"I'm not sure but I think the perfect types of pieces around Ingram and Zion look something like Malcolm Brogdon, Mikal Bridges and Jonathan Isaac. At least two of our starting 5 would need to be pretty great level defensive players but it to work on that end. The reality is we run a pretty legitimate offense even if the roster is a shambles, I just wouldn't be shifting Ingram so soon."
"I wanted Jrue Holiday or Malcolm Brogdon that offseason.  I think Kemba has value and is a great leader, but what we‚Äôd get back in a trade wouldn‚Äôt be a good enough return imo"
Do people still think Porzingis is a good defender?  Also: Malcolm Brogdon and SGA
"I don‚Äôt think they need an *elite* playmaker, but definitely do need someone who is looking to find his teammates open looks consistently.   Which is why it was so disappointing when the Celtics used their max cap space on Kemba. We needed a point guard who was a more natural playmaker, but can still go out there and score 14-18 a night. Not a volume shooter who, rather inconveniently, is also a defensive liability and has an extensive injury history.   We needed someone like Malcolm Brogdon, who was also available that summer and would have cost far less than Kemba too. Or even a guy like Ricky Rubio, who really focuses on finding his teammates quality looks. Maybe someone like Lonzo Ball becomes available, I think his fit is also good with the Celtics."

"Nate McM fit the roster a lot more than Nate Bjorkgren does imo. Brogdon is slow, our frontcourt is slow, Caris isn't exactly a dynamic transition player either.  I think the New Nate has made plenty of mistakes trying to play weird trap happy blitzing defenses with a bunch of slow footed players that are mediocre defenders individually. He's tried to gimmick his way out of it. However, Old Nate was stubborn af in his tenure as a Pacer. This stubbornness allowed the team to have an identity though, which is huge to me.   It was a mix of the three: roster, coaching, and health.  Again, I never called for McMillan being fired, until after watching the Miami series and hearing him say several times that Bam Fcking Adebayo was the switch they were hunting to guard Malcolm Brogdon. After dozens of failed attempts at this, I was ready almost ready for something new. Even then still gave him benefit of the doubt, until reports came out of players also being disgruntled by lack of flexibility.  He's a very good coach, but has his flaws. He's still in the 2nd/3rd tier though. No need for this BS about an org that saw him for years being dead wrong and ignorant. It wasn't a good fit, even if he got more out of them at times than was expected nationally."
"\&gt;  50/40/90 guy  You say that like it's an absolute qualification for MVP or it's super common...there's 8 players in the history of the NBA that are in the 50/40/90 club lol. Bird, Mark Price, Reggie, Nash, Dirk, KD, Curry and ....Malcolm Brogdon. Guess Brogdon got robbed of MVP.  Jokic won't get it but he's not far from it: .566/.402/.863"
Reminds me of the season Malcolm Brogdon had with us before he left.
Malcolm Brogdon. A plus defender with ball handling capabilities and a real good shot.
that'd have to be a rookie class of MCW or Malcolm Brogdon..
Malcolm Brogdon is really good though
Imagine giving up Wiseman and a Lottery pick for Malcolm Brogdon and his bloated salary.
I'm excited. I remember his mke summer league run. He reminded me a little bit of Malcolm Brogdon at the time... Just looks like a natural baller and makes shit look effortless.
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
Malcolm Brogdon. And I love CP3 but if he coached he‚Äôd def lead the league in techs lol
"The Pelicans already have a pretty good offense, they've been top 10 all season. I don't think they need to start a stretch big . Their defense is trash though  If we were giving the Pels lineup a makeover you'd want a better guard to replace Bledsoe (a player like Malcolm Brogdon, lets say.. or maybe NAW turns into that guy) and a more consistent 3&amp;D player to replace Lonzo (think Norman Powell). With Zion developing so quickly they aren't far off, but they can't stand pat with their current set up."
If i had kids I would trust Malcolm Brogdon wholeheartedly to babysit them
"This. I had him on my fantasy team this year so I was happy (at least in the beginning), but when I watched him play, I felt like he heard me yelling ‚Äúshoot it Malcolm!‚Äù. Dude takes a ton of shots and some nights it‚Äôll go in more than others. I think when TJ McConnell played, the offense seemed to run a lot more smoothly, and TJ‚Äôs not even an above average passing point guard. Brogdon was a better fit in Milwaukee imo"
"Hello yes, I would like 1 Malcolm Brogdon please"
Damn ya'll are salty.   Guess Brogdon's 50/40/90 is more impressive than Kyrie's 50/38.5/92.2 this year. Too bad Kyrie can't join the elite club that Malcolm Brogdon is a part of!
Malcolm Brogdon was really so salty about playing shooting guard he chose this over starting on a contender lmao   I‚Äôd say I feel bad for him but dude dug his own grave if Pacers FO is really this bad at their jobs
LeVert doesnt deserve this after that cancer scare.  cant believe this can happen in a team with Malcolm Brogdon. thought he was an S tier leader.  shuffle the roster. i still believe in LeVert-Sabo.  i miss saying Pacers West
Malcolm brogdon is part of the reason pacers can't stop dribble drives for shit. He struggles with any kind of quick guard.
"I got chu fam  Nate Bjorkgren, Indiana Pacers (30-34, 9th Seed in Eastern Confernce)  When the Pacers fired McMillan just weeks after giving him a one-year extension in late August, there were two traits that had clearly led to his exit: His hard-nosed style had caused consternation among players, and his unwillingness to embrace analytics was seen as a problem that simply had to be fixed. Bjorkgren, who had worked under Toronto‚Äôs Nick Nurse and made several G League stops along the way, was supposed to represent a change of direction on these two fronts ‚Äî a new-age coach to take over a talented roster.  While he is indeed far more invested when it comes to coaching in accordance with modern-day NBA thinking, Bjorkgren‚Äôs abrasive style has come as a surprise ‚Äî in interactions with players and his own coaching staff members¬†‚Äî¬†and led to the kind of frustration that has caused significant concern. It hasn‚Äôt been reserved merely for the players, either, as several sources cited instances where Bjorkgren‚Äôs personality and tendency to be controlling with assistant coaches and other staff members caused unnecessary tension.  Players throughout the roster have voiced their dissatisfaction with Bjorkgren and their general unhappiness amid a down season, including key star players in Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon, sources said. Those sources¬†say Bjorkgren has implemented an analytics style of coaching that players privately do not find suitable for the roster, and that there have been issues among the coaching staff at times. Bjorkgren has worked to address matters internally, and one source described him as ‚Äúover-communicative‚Äù to make sure he is sharing and receiving messages from the roster. One coaching source predicted that this would have a similar ending to what took place in Charlotte in 2013, when former St. John‚Äôs assistant Mike Dunlap was fired after just one season amid widespread player frustration.  Indiana‚Äôs front office, led by president Kevin Pritchard and general manager Chad Buchanan, has built a players-first culture. After a loss in early April, Pritchard had an emotional message to players: Sources say the longtime executive tried to assure the players that the season would improve and their fortunes would turn.  As always, the contracts of all the involved parties is an important part of the context. Bjorkgren and Sabonis, in particular, both have multiple seasons left on their deals and, for better or worse, are connected when it comes to their successes and failures. Perhaps all of the principal decision-makers need a sit-down to iron out issues.  Across the roster, players are having career seasons under Bjorkgren ‚Äî including Sabonis and Brogdon. The offense has been run through Sabonis throughout the campaign, and he has responded with an excellent season: 20.2 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. The Pacers, like most of the league, have dealt with injuries to key players throughout the season ‚Äî currently Myles Turner being sidelined with a partially torn plantar plate in his right foot. They had to adapt to a blockbuster trade that sent Victor Oladipo out and brought in Caris LeVert. Oladipo had averaged 20 points per game in his nine games to start the season in Indiana, and while LeVert has posted 20 points per game himself since returning from his two-month absence after a procedure to cure kidney cancer.  In many ways, Pacers officials understood growing pains would come with the first-year head coach.¬†Management had a level of comfort with Bjorkgren prior to his hire partly because of their previous history which dates back decades.¬†What this all means going forward remains to be seen. Pacers owner Herb Simon has historically been reluctant to make coaching changes this early in the process, as every coach since he bought the team in 1983 has been given at least two seasons (Dick Versace had parts of three campaigns from 1989 to 1990, but just one complete season). More recently, former Pacers coaches like McMillan, Frank Vogel, Jim O‚ÄôBrien and Rick Carlisle all had at least four seasons at the helm. Still, the level of early frustration here in the Bjorkgren era means this situation is definitely worth monitoring."
Malcolm Brogdon snubbed.
"3P% is only part of it, there's also release speed and height.  Some good shooters have slow releases so it's easy to run them off the line even if you don't guard them tightly. Examples are JaMychal Green and Malcolm Brogdon a couple years ago (he is better now). Guys like this don't provide great spacing because teams are still fine with helping and recovering off them.  The statistical signature of this kind of guy is high 3P%, but low 3PA / 100 possessions.  A good spacer needs both accuracy _and_ volume"
"I think of a 3&amp;D player as someone who doesn't handle the ball or run the offense very much. In my mind, Malcolm Brogdon and Fred VanVleet are too good to be 3&amp;D players."

Once again its my fault. I said Malcolm jrue and bogdan. Never said bogdan and brogdon in the same sentence. Look in the mirror bro im done with this
A bunch of people earlier today said Bogdan &amp; Brogdon are better than Jrue.   While almost every elite player in the league has said how good Jrue is defensively and especially offensively while talking about how he‚Äôs there toughest matchup in the league.  Yet you have dudes saying Malcolm Brogdon and Bogdan are better.
"https://youtu.be/-CzZZ-ohpFQ  Here‚Äôs a list of a bunch of elite NBA players talking about how good Jrue holiday is especially on the offensive end. Add PG, LeBron, PJ Tucker &amp; Kelly Oubre to that list too.  However, people said Bogdan &amp; Malcolm Brogdon are better than him."
Anyone who think Malcolm fucking Brogdon is better than Jrue is an idiot nephew üòÖ
"For the 2020 playoffs, he repeatedly tried to isolate Malcolm Brogdon on Bam Adebayo when the Heat were switching. Even though Warren was red-hot, he did not run him off of pin-downs or have him in any off ball action, just isolated at the elbow where Jimmy and Bam could contain him. He also did not try to attack Herro or Duncan Robinson through isolation or PnR, even though we had Oladipo, Brogdon, and Warren (decent isolation players). His lack of offensive sets also ensured that the bench was unplayable, since no one could generate their own offense.  On defense, everyone apart from Myles Turner was out of position. Oladipo esp. kept helping off of Duncan Robinson, and Dragic killed the Pacers when Brogdon went under screens on PnR. He made no schematic changes either, where going to a switching defense would've helped when the guards were chasing Robinson and Herro off of multiple screens. Instead, the guards were left chasing and the team paid the price.  After the playoffs, 4 different players went to management asking for him to be fired (Brogdon the chief among them). I can't say anything about his success in Atlanta, but his firing from Indiana was well-deserved and long overdue."
Neither is Malcolm Brogdon.

"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"I see this a lot, but I don‚Äôt agree. I‚Äôm not a big floor/ceiling guy in general, because guys jump out of the mold all the time. Giannis, FVV, Siakim, Grant this season, young Kawhi, etc..  Sure I‚Äôm a Homer 4 Hali, but it always grates on me to see people say so matter-of-factly that a rookie is going to develop one way or another. We thought Tyreke Evans would be a perennial all-star. Cameron Payne was surely out of the league within a few years when he was a rookie. Wiggins has been from expected floor to expected ceiling and everywhere around and in between  I‚Äôm just sayin.. I know it‚Äôs all just our predictions but I see a lot more for Halliburton than efficient role player and it‚Äôs funny to see folks pigeonhole him into Malcolm brogdon when it‚Äôs only been like 50 games (and brogdon is much better than he gets credit for)"
"&gt;Just kidding, Ant is the truth. This draft is already looking much better than it was made out to be. I think there‚Äôll be multiple perennial All Stars in LaMelo/Ant/Haliburton and some really strong starters.  I don't want to sound like I'm negative but I don't see Tyrese Haliburton as some kind of all star. He's that Malcolm Brogdon/FVV type of player (not to say he's bad (he's quite good) but just that's the ceiling for him)."
Would a Kemba for Malcolm Brogdon/Jeremy Lamb work? The Celtics could through in a pick
"youngest player in the 2011 draft, yup he's roughly the same age as Malcolm Brogdon  and yeah Biz scored 21 as a Magic, he's had 15-19 points a whole bunch of times, but that was the only 20+ game he's ever had. Vernon does that his first ever time in the rotation lol"
I know I'm in the minority but I don't think availability should be a big part of ROTY. I just want the award to go to the best rookie. Like it's weird how Malcolm Brogdon won the best rookie award when everyone knew Embiid was significantly better.
Pretty spot on other than the IT and Malcolm Brogdon stuff
"&gt; Kyle Lowry and Trevor Ariza are both 35  Which one did you think was a different age?    &gt; ALSO MALCOLM BROGDON IS OLDER THAN AD WTF  WTF indeed! Damn, I had to check that one to be sure lol"
MKG is younger than Malcolm Brogdon
Malcolm Brogdon is a year older than Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and the same age as Bismack Biyombo  Taj Gibson is older than Dwight Howard

sabonis is a 20/10 24yo all-star  Oladipo was a 23/5/5 before his injury  not signing pg13 to a supermax allowed them to sign malcolm brogdon avg 21/6/5  Pacers have done a fantastic job obtaining value from pg trade and allotting his supermax-money elsewhere. Oladipo injury fcked them up more imo
"&gt; Pretty sure he‚Äôs the 3rd ever second round rookie who has multiple 20 point games  there's no way that's accurate. It can't be that uncommon.  Off the top of my head, Isaiah Thomas, Malcolm Brogdon, Jokic, and that's just the last few years. Hell, Caleb Martin went undrafted and was a point shy of back-to-back 20 point games for us last season before the season ended, he only played like the final quarter of the season, and he sucks ass.  Maybe he's the 3rd 2nd round rookie for the Bucks to do that? Behind Brogdon and Ramon Sessions maybe?"

"I actually think someone like Malcolm Brogdon could have gotten ROTY and MIP. If he jumped from what he was in his 2nd year to what he is now, but in his 3rd year, he definitely would have won MIP."
"Totally agree there, but no one is asking Malcolm Brogdon his opinion rather than LeBron, which should be what they're doing if they're not just looking for headlines. Obviously this isn't on the media for what LeBron said, but this is exactly what they're hoping for."
He is really really good.  A lower end all star. He did get overrated for a bit by a lot of people just because of his amazing start to the year (same with Malcolm Brogdon) but he is pretty similar to what he was last year.   He‚Äôs a guy I see having like five or so all star appearances with a few snubs. He‚Äôs probably in the 20-30 range without actually making a list of best players .

"&gt;You know damn well we don‚Äôt win the chip last year without AD   No, I don't, and neither do you.  James with those seven traded players, plus Zubac, and the best of the rest of the other 2020 Lakers is a formidable team.  James has won titles with far less help, against better opposition.  And again, Davis was not the only player the Lakers could have obtained.  They could've kept Ingram, Hunter, and most of those picks and still obtained, say, Jimmy Butler and Malcolm Brogdon.

Brogdan... a cross between bogdan bogdanovic and Malcolm brogdon
Malcolm Brogdon
"Jason Kidd is dumbest coach I've seen. The Bucks improve 20+ wins simply by replacing him with Bud. Kidd produced some of the most brain dead decisions imaginable. Including but certainly not limited to, instructing Middleton to intentionally foul up 3 because he was worried about a 4pt play. Also once forgetting Malcolm Brogdon was on the team for a half, only subbing him in with 3 minutes left in the 2nd. Then playing him almost the entire 2nd half for him to finish with 25 minutes."
I think it has kinda cooled down but for a minute it was Malcolm Brogdon. He was super underrated then he started to completely suck but people I guess didn‚Äôt pay attention and continued calling him underrated. He‚Äôs starting to pick it up again and the underrated post have pretty much stopped thankfully.
"He is not a candidate, the guys who are candidates who won‚Äôt make it are having miles better seasons than clarkson, look at Malcolm brogdon for example."
"2016. Simmons,Ingram,Brown,Hield,Jamal Murray,Sabonis, Beasley, Levert, Siakam, Dejonte Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, and FVV was an undrafted player from this class"
There‚Äôs a difference between a winning player and a star here. Like the year Malcolm Brogdon won ROY over Embiid
He will most likely be in the Malcolm Brogdon tier of players. I would easily give him up and whatever else for James Harden
Malcolm Brogdon tbh
"Even ignoring the other players, you are trading the better yardie for a worse yardie. Just waiting for a big to come onto the buyout market would be better than trading Powell for Drummond. Reaching out to Dedmon to see if he wants to sign for the rest of season is better than trading a better player for a worse player who plays another position. When Drummond is shooting at the third worst percentage in the league at the rim (minimum 100 attempts) only ahead of Fred VanVleet and Malcolm Brogdon, he is still a bad defender and teams rebound better when he is on the bench, why would I want to trade a positive player like Norman for a negative player. Keeping Norman and just riding with Baynes, playing more OG at C or running more Yuta+Boucher together is far better than trading Norman for a player whose value was SO LOW just last season that they got traded for Brandon Knight John Henson and one 2nd round pick."

"You‚Äôre acting like efficiency is the thing that ends all player debate arguments. Are Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon better than peak Westbrook too? After all, they‚Äôve both been in the 50/40/90 club and Russ hasn‚Äôt. Shit, I guess they‚Äôre better than MJ and LeBron too.   Russ dragged a garbage tier team that wouldn‚Äôt win 10 games without him to the sixth seed in a brutally tough Western conference. They had literally no other playmakers on that team, and for a guy that wasn‚Äôt very good at shooting jumpers, Presti didn‚Äôt surround him with any legit floor spacers either. The team couldn‚Äôt keep a lead against a particularly aggressive group of pylons without Westbrook spoon feeding them easy points.   I‚Äôd be interested to see how Steph would do with no other intelligent players like Draymond on his team, and no other three point threats for that matter. He wouldn‚Äôt be much more efficient than Westbrook was if I had to guess. And that‚Äôs with me not even mentioning that Steve Kerr is a significantly better coach than Billy Donovan was back then."
"Ok, but this is all just a discussion of *scheme*. Rudy could be the most switchable defender in the NBA, but if he doesn't play on a team with a personnel that will facilitate him switching, then he won't switch. And when you look at the Jazz there are *maybe* two players in the rotation who could regularly switch onto Rudy's guy? The problem with Rudy in a switching defense isn't Rudy, it's the fact that *everyone else on his team is so much smaller than him* and can't replace the defensive presence he brings to the paint, where he's regularly asked to defend two or three guys at a time - and does so successfully. The Jazz have a lot of decent-to-great wing defenders (Bogdanovic, Ingles, O'Neale, Niang is a pretty solid rotation defensively), but *none* of those guys are equipped to protect the rim or seriously guard the five. And Conley and Mitchell shouldn't be guarding wing players at their size. Clarkson is a defensive liability.  Rudy *can* switch onto elite guards. He just *doesn't*, because if he switches onto elite guards, the Jazz don't have the defensive personnel to support him switching. Apart from Gobert, the Jazz are a pretty small team; their starting PF is only 6'4"". This is the reason why Gobert's defensive numbers in the clutch are [so fucking astronomical](https://www.ksl.com/article/46705809/rudy-gobert-has-been-the-leagues-best-clutch-player--another-reason-he-should-be-an-all-star); because those are the only time that coach Q says ""Hey Rudy, I'm putting you on their best guy"". Because when crunch time happens and everything is on the line, you'd rather lose to Derrick Jones Jr. or Daniel Theis than Dame or Tatum. [Just look at this play here](https://twitter.com/Chase_Observes/status/1210481904085950464?s=20): Dame has the ball with about 20 seconds left; Gobert is his primary defender, he runs Dame off the line, forces a pass out, and then the ball ends up in Melo's hands, which Gobert swats out of the air. The numbers back this up too - in the last two seasons, [Gobert has averaged 0.73 points per attempt on isolation attempts by guards](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208811329873530880) in switches, and that doesn't even capture the amount of times where a guard attempt an iso against Gobert and then thinks better of it and wisely ditches that idea instead.   But just to throw you a bone, here are a few clips of Rudy guarding players on the perimeter and generally doing a good job, in case the numbers aren't good enough for you.  [Rudy on Malcolm Brogdon](https://twitter.com/dsjenson/status/1219486493518913536?s=20)  [Rudy swatting Trae's iso attempt](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1208051219056300033?s=20).  [This play where he recovers from Austin Rivers' crossover and then fucking sends him to the shadow realm](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1222233799729147904?s=20)  [Rudy Gobert stopping an iso attempt by Devonte Graham](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208810396787695616?s=20)  The problem isn't Rudy. The problem is that when Rudy leaves the paint, the entire defensive scheme collapses because Utah's scheme is built on two things: running guys off the 3pt line, and funneling them towards Rudy in the paint because he's basically the one of the greatest rim protectors that basketball has ever seen. And if he's not in the paint, there's nobody to rebound, there's nobody to box out, there's nobody to contest at the rim, which means that if a guy manages to get past his man (this will happen, sometimes Bogdanovic just gets cooked, or Mitchell has a defensive lapse), it's a free two points. And if Rudy leaves the paint, then the Jazz can't be as aggressive in closing out on 3's, because if they sell out too hard to contest, their guy will just drive to the rim and all of Utah will just have to pray that they blow a wide-open layup.  In essence, if the Jazz switch Rudy onto a perimeter guy, they're giving up a thousand free looks at the basket in order to shut down one guy from scoring. Sometimes, that's the right play to make. But for 99% of the game, it's way better to let Rudy camp in the paint and do the thing he's better at doing than basically anyone else in NBA history. Make people shit their pants when they get past their man, then put up an inefficient floater or fadeaway 2."
"Brogdon and Sabonis seem out of sync to me sometimes. I like them both a lot, so no offense intended. Just seems like Malcolm wants to do his own thing most of the time"

"He's our Malcolm Brogdon, 4 year college PG selected early in the second round who shoots close to 50/40/90"
"Lowry is an obvious great choice but I don't think Clippers have assets to offer, unfortunately. Malcolm Brogdon could be dope if the Clippers could find a way to match salaries, I don't think the Pacers can claim to be trying to contend this year or next. I would love to dish [Lou Williams and Marcus Morris for Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yxdjjcv6), but I don't think that would help the Pacers enough."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"I understand what you‚Äôre saying but my point is that Malcolm Brogdon being upset with McMillan isn‚Äôt something that should lead to firing. Of course he‚Äôs upset, it‚Äôd be bad if you weren‚Äôt upset after getting sweeped. But Brogdon, as good as he is, isn‚Äôt a guy the FO has to bend over backwards to keep happy. This would be like Dillon Brooks saying he was unhappy with Taylor Jenkins after losing. FO‚Äôs just can‚Äôt be firing good coaches over stuff like that. There were reports that Jimmy Butler was upset at the Heat coaching staff after getting swept in the first round this year. And that‚Äôs a guy who really should be kept happy, yet the heat aren‚Äôt even considering a change. I really think the locker room stuff was probably salvageable and if it wasn‚Äôt, the FO probably should have chosen to keep McMillan over Brogdon. I think it was largely about the FO thinking their roster was capable of more in the playoffs than they we‚Äôre getting with McMillan when in actuality it doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs true."
"The only valid criticism is losing the locker room, but even then...usually that refers to star players. If Malcolm Brogdon, who‚Äôs you know, a good player and all, is getting this kind of power and input, it‚Äôs kind of disturbing. On many other teams if Brogdon was unhappy with the coach, it‚Äôs really no big deal. That Brogdon is considered this core piece by the organization is pretty much the epitome of everything that‚Äôs going on in Indiana."
&gt; Malcolm Brogdon was reportedly the most upset with the coaching staff:  Is Brogdon ever happy with his coach?
Malcolm Brogdon Bogdonovic
Lol after all that that‚Äôs what you came up with?.. I‚Äôll take Malcom Brogdon‚Äôs word over yours.  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2824568-malcolm-brogdon-on-milwaukee-ive-never-lived-in-a-city-this-segregated.amp.html  https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/03/05/390723644/why-is-milwaukee-so-bad-for-black-people
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
"Just going to throw out this datapoint.  Secondary ball-handlers in the NBA who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists per game this season: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Domantas Sabonis, TJ McConnell, Malcolm Brogdon \].  That's it.  He was also 23rd in assists, in the entire league.  And he did that playing for a coach with basically no offensive ideas beyond ""Give James the ball and watch"", ""Give Davis the ball and watch"", and ""Give Schroder the ball and watch"".  Actually, a few other stats, while I'm here.  Schroder led the Lakers in assist/turnover ratio.  He also had the 3rd-highest offensive rating, behind only James and Davis.  Sure, it'd be nice if he could shoot better, but the skills he has are not cheaply-obtained in the NBA.  &gt;I think Schroder could end up getting a 4 year, 65 million dollar contract  I will be shocked if he signs for less than $20M/year.  &gt;Do you think he will re-sign with the Lakers, or join some other team and take on a bigger role?  The Lakers cannot replace him, so it makes no sense for them not to match any offer."
Suggs doesn‚Äôt excite me at all. I don‚Äôt see any star power from him. I think he‚Äôll have a Malcolm Brogdon type career.
I don't recall Malcolm Brogdon being an MVP
"i mean he coached Portland up until what 2012 then wasn't a head coach until Indiana in 2016-2017, really you should be considering his record for Indiana only, different timeline, a lot can change in those years.  So 2016-2017 aka the best Cleveland Cavs roster when LeBron was there. No matter who the coach was Indiana wasn't beating Cleveland that year.   2017-2018, Cleveland again and it's a close series with a breakout Oladipo. Considering they just lost Paul George, having LeBron in the first round and almost knocking him out was pretty good. The result was completely overachieving for a rebuilding team.  2018-2019. Oladipo is injured their best scoring players are Bojan Bogdanivch and Tyreke Evans of course they get swept by the Celtics they literally have a shell of a roster, it wouldn't matter who the head coach was they weren't getting past the first round.  2019-2020. Sabonis breaks out, Oladipo comes back as a shell, Malcolm Brogdon brought on, they get swept in the first round by...oh the Miami Heat aka the team in the finals.  So wait a second..literally every year the Pacers had a first round exit to the finals team minus 2019 where they literally had no star player due to catastrophic injury.  What the hell are Pacers fans smoking here man, do they need someone to blame because literally it doesn't matter who the coach was the roster was never good enough to beat the best team in the East."
I‚Äôll take one Malcolm Brogdon please
"Yeah I guess you have a point actually. 55/40/90 is a lot more exclusive than I would have thought. Literally the only members of that club is Kyrie Irving x1 and Stephen Curry x3.  On the flip side, setting it to just 50/40/90, but instead using 2P%, gives us the following:  Larry Bird x2  Mark Price x2  Reggie Miller x1  Chris Mullin x1  Peja Stojakovic x1  Steve Nash x4  Jose Calderon x1  Ray Allen x1 (I forgot to check minimums before saying he'd get like 4, my bad)  Kevin Durant x1  J.J. Redick x1  Stephen Curry x4  CJ McCollum x1  Kyrie Irving x2  Malcolm Brogdon x1  Khris Middleton x1  In retrospect and after remembering what the minimum makes are, I actually agree with you. I think this list covers it pretty well, with it being largely the same except for a couple newcomers, as well as Steph, Price, and Kyrie getting more of these seasons."
What do you think of Malcolm Brogdon? Doesn't that look like a push shot?
"2016 (first GSW ring): Conley, Jrue, Korver, CP3 (probably can throw him on the list every season), Tony Allen (I think), Pau, Wall, Kyrie, and Love  2019 (TOR ring): Boogie, Embiid, Blake, KD, Klay, Malcolm Brogdon  Those are just 2 of the recent seasons I vividly remember with lots of injuries in the playoffs. Embiid is injured in the playoffs a lot so his name would come up a lot of seasons, CP3 as well, be interesting to go back and look at the Kawhi/Spurs injury and the Rose/Bulls injury to see if there were any other key players injured those seasons.  And I‚Äôm  not even counting players who were playing through injuries.   And all of these were just injuries that happened in the playoffs. No doubt there were injuries during the season that affected seeding and caused teams to miss the playoffs. I don‚Äôt think this season is an anomaly, just recency bias."
"&gt;pay Schroder $25m and you'll never sniff the Finals again  Secondary ball-handlers who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists: Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Malcolm Brogdon, and Domantas Sabonis.  Only 25 players of any description averaged more assists, and that despite Schroder playing a good chunk of his minutes with offensive talent like Matthews and Morris.  If they let Schroder walk, they won't win anything.  While I'd rather not pay him $25m, that actually makes no difference except to the Buss Family bank account, since they are over the cap anyway.  They will be better with Schroder -- at any price -- than with whoever they could sign to replace him."
"&gt;This year it was back down to 54% which is quite bad but still above his own average.  League median is only 57%.  Schroder could obviously be more efficient, but managing even 54% in their ""system"" this season was not bad.  Vogel has no offensive ideas beyond ""Isolate James and watch him"", ""Isolate Davis and let him shoot fadeaways"", and pick-and-rolls.  Everything else was just freelancing, like on a playground.  So for a good chunk of the season, Schroder was out with some combination of Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Caldwell-Pope and they were just making up whatever.  They were completely dependent on Schroder's ability to break down a defense and make something good happen, which he often did.  Even surrounded by that largely questionable offense, Schroder averaged 5.8 assists -- which is 26th in the League, and more than all but a couple secondary ball-handlers.  The very impressive company he's in there is: Steph Curry, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
Well there‚Äôs more than just the voice and physical similarity. He has a bachelor degree in history and a master‚Äôs in public policy. Went to private school but his parents moved them to the poorer neighbourhoods to let them mingle with everyone. Add volunteering trips to Ghana. [He has a lot going on off court really.](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/01/malcolm-brogdon-interview-milwaukee-bucks-nba)
"It‚Äôs not really a bad supporting cast, but it is an incomplete one for sure. Guys like Finney-Smith, Hardaway, Brunson, and Kleber are all guys that would be great role players on a contending team.   We just need a Malcolm Brogdon type of player that can put the ball on the floor and generate some offense on his own aside from Luka, we just have too many catch and shoot guys right now.  Center is the one area where I agree we are absolutely atrocious though. We need to dump KP and upgrade at the 5 position ASAP."
* Pacers get CJ McCollum  * Blazers get Marcus Smart  * Celtics get Malcolm Brogdon  Add in whatever draft picks and filler players you need to make everything balanced. Who says no?
I'd expect someone to throw the bag at him. He reminds me a lot of Malcolm brogdon. He's decisive and he plays extremely well next to a ball dominant wing.
Malcolm Brogdon maybe? Brogdon and Levert for Kemba and 3 1sts?
"Yeah people don‚Äôt realize it but Atlanta/GA is one of the hotbeds for basketball talent. Dwight, Jaylen Brown, Lou Will, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick Favors, KCP, WCJ, Jae Crowder all currently in the league...then you have Shareef Abdur-Rahim World B Free, Horace Grant, Josh Smith, just to name a few historically"
"Brogdon, Malcolm"
Whenever I tune in I‚Äôve never seen Malcolm Brogdon make a jumper since he got to the Pacers.
"Interesting point. There wasn't a ton of free agent point guards in 2019 either.  Kyrie left, DLO got S&amp;T'd to a max contract he's not worth (someone mentioned that a potential Kyrie/DLO S&amp;T was possible but that would've saddled Boston with a bad contract) and Kemba.  The other two solid starting guards that were available were Rubio and Malcolm Brogdon. I'm a big Rubio fan; as we saw during 2018-2019 there are consequences to having too many players that want their touches. There's something to be said about having a table-setter point guard that doesn't demand a lot of action. CP3 is an improved version of that for the Suns, but lets not forget that Rubio took the Bubble Suns to 8-0."
"Sure thing. I‚Äôll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
Malcolm Brogdon is literally just 2 Oscars from The Office in a trench coat
Malcolm Brogdon is the new Andre Miller
Malcolm Brogdon is the Walmart Tim Duncan of guards.

"Something that isn‚Äôt talked about enough with this Bucks teams bs the ones from 2019/2020 is the way Giannis is playing offball more. In previous years Giannis seemed to always have the ball at the top of the key and he‚Äôd just try and bull rush the basket and either muscle up a shot or dish it out for a 3 pointer. This year I‚Äôve seen a lot more of Giannis cutting hard without the ball and it seems to make the offense flow much better than in years past. Certainly the addition of Holiday and Tucker help the team, but they also lost Robin Lopez and Malcolm Brogdon, which were pretty big pieces for them in the past. I think we need to acknowledge that coaching and decision making has also improved and it‚Äôs not simply due to personnel changes (though that certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt)."

"But at the same time Nash has also said in interviews how he thinks players today take too many ill advised three point shots. Nash was the first MVP I saw growing up and his game was a lot more inside out then I think takes like these give credit. I don‚Äôt know if Nash would ever hit that high of a three point attempt average just because he was such an adept three level score and he was also one of the smartest players from his era and I think he would certainly hit 5 3PA a game 7 feels a little too high for Nash especially since he had a good feel for the flow of a game and if he went like 0-2 or 3 he would try and attack another way. I actually see a lot of the intellect of Nash‚Äôs game in guys like Malcolm Brogdon or Devin Booker, albeit they aren‚Äôt necessarily at the level of passer that Nash was. They are hardly ever going to disrupt the flow of their offense for a bad outside shot, they get in and attack the paint and will take what you give them they got spots at all 3 levels where those guys are cash.  He also wasn‚Äôt a high-usage guy. In his mvp seasons he had I think 18 and 21% usage rates. I think even if Nash was lacing em up having grown up today he‚Äôs too smart of a guy to just jack 3s up at the rates we see guys like Duncan Robinson or Davis Bertans do. I think we‚Äôd always wring our hands a little bit asking Nash to shoot more"
"Holding him to 9-22 FG, 1-6 3PT is getting cooked?   Last year in the playoffs Kawhi went off but not against Kleber. According to Second Spectrum, there have been 17 different occasions where an opponent has defended Kawhi on at least 100 half-court positions in a playoff series. (Since 2013-14, which is when tracking began.) Kleber in last year's playoffs held Kawhi to his third-lowest effective field goal percentage (41.4) among that group, behind only Malcolm Brogdon in 2019's Eastern Conference Finals (34.5) and Kevin Durant in the 2013-14 Western Conference Finals (39.7).   The other Mav who has spent a bunch of time on Kawhi in that series was Dorian Finney-Smith, and he got torched: Kawhi had 30 points on 66 half-court matchups with DFS, compared with 44 on 115 matchups with Kleber. His eFG% against DFS is 63.2%, which dwarfs the figure he has posted against Kleber as well.  Kawhi is a top 10 player in the league and will obviously find a way to score, but Maxi is making it as hard as anyone else for Kawhi to score."
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there‚Äôs also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you‚Äôre never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami‚Äôs, Indy‚Äôs, or Boston‚Äôs (or even Brooklyn‚Äôs or Philly‚Äôs) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That‚Äôs a lot of important guys from the East‚Äôs playoff picture and that‚Äôs not even mentioning what‚Äôs gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that‚Äôs gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don‚Äôt tear it down (which they 100% shouldn‚Äôt they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he‚Äôs earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don‚Äôt wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying ‚Äúhey, we broke in to the 5 seed‚Äù because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it‚Äôs a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the ‚Äúcontending in the East‚Äù tier"
The Brooklyn Nets before KD and Kyrie showed up were trending towards being an Indiana Pacers level team. Make the playoffs every year but usually lose in round one. Pacers big FA signing last summer was Malcolm Brogdon. Nets? Durant and Kyrie. Being in NYC was significantly more important in getting Durant and Kyrie than having a good front office was because there are plenty of good front offices on small market teams that weren‚Äôt even in consideration for Durant and Kyrie

KYRIE IRVING IS NOW TIED WITH MALCOLM BROGDON
"Sunday night, Irving locked in a rare ‚Äô50-40-90‚Ä≤ season with shooting percentages of 50.6% on field goals overall, 40.2% on 3-pointers and 92.2% from the free-throw line. He becomes the ninth player to do so, notably joining teammate Kevin Durant (51.0/41.6/90.5 in 2012-13 for OKC) as the fifth to manage it while averaging at least 25.0 ppg.  The other seven are: Larry Bird (2x), Mark Price, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash (4x), Dirk Nowitzki, Stephen Curry and Malcolm Brogdon."
"As a Bulls fan looking for a PG to fit alongside Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic I would go with:  1 Malcolm Brogdon  2 Spencer Dinwiddie  3 Fred VanVleet  Brogdon *slightly* edges out the others in some more advanced stats like TS% or PER but it's very slight.  Dinwiddie is the best facilitator of the group, but again it's only a slight edge.  For the Bulls it'd come down to the best on ball defender as that's currently a weakness on the roster in guarding other elite PGs in the NBA."
Embiid got robbed by 32 year old Malcolm Brogdon
"This is extremely rare. Since 1990, only 2 players picked outside the top 10 have won ROY. MCW (11th) and Malcolm Brogdon (36, very weird year, arguably should have been Embiid). Almost all ROYs in the last 30 years were top 5 picks."
"4/84. That puts him at 21 million a year. On par with Malcolm Brogdon and above the likes of Freddie and Rubio. Regardless of my personal opinions on Lonzo, he is a decent guard and is still young."
"There's like a billion examples like this though.    Like, Malcolm Brogdon is older than Anthony Davis despite being drafted 4 years after him."
Malcolm brogdon is 3 years older than giannis  although he's drafted 3 years after giannis were drafted
I forgot he is younger than Malcolm brogdon even thought he's drafted 3 years before Malcolm did.
"I'm sorry, I'm probably just being whooshed. But the Bucks aren't good at drafting? They've drafted 2 first ballot hall of famers in the last 25 years. Also, aside from that, they drafted malcolm brogdon recently, who turned out to be a very good player. Also, as for just functional nba players, they drafted kevin porter jr., norman powell, and donte divincenzo since giannis got drafted. All three were drafted after the 16th pick of the draft. I would say they've done a great job drafting. That said, the trade makes complete sense and I really hope they win the championship."
"I know its all jokes and everything. But Im sure another team wants him. They see some value that us as fans dont see. Obv its not going to be for Dame, Malcolm Brogdon, or even Tobias Harris. But Im sure some teams probably see something in. They most likely dont see him as some kind of all stat. But maybe as a role player or what not."
Is he very similar to Malcolm Brogdon
" Kinda bias but if being an all star isn't a requirement why not Malcolm brogdon? The dude is an above average defender and, ya know, actually plays point guard."
"They should pick a role player who worked with the coaching staff last season so it's an easier transition: Eric Gordon, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, or Malcolm Brogdon."
Defensive anchor and point-center on a dynasty vs a guy the Bucks were debating keeping over Malcolm fucking Brogdon? Hmmmmmmm
"Malcolm Brogdon, Murray Brogdon mpj Gordon Jokic is nasty"
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"Lol. I didn't say anything of the sort.   Every year we get fans who delude themselves into thinking they'll get a great return for an unrestricted free agent in a sign and trade and it almost never happens. The Hornets got cash for Kemba Walker. The Celtics got cash for Gordon Hayward. The Nuggets got cash for Jerami Grant.   Usually when teams get more, it's because a player is a restricted free agent. The Bucks got three picks for Malcolm Brogdon because he was an RFA and they could match. The only UFA I can think of fetching a lot of value in a S&amp;T was prime LeBron James going to Miami. No UFA got a lot of value back for their teams in the last two years. If you can think of one before that, let me know.  I'm not saying Lowry is leaving Toronto. There's a really good chance he stays. I'm just saying if he's leaving Toronto, it's unlikely Toronto gets a lot back in a S&amp;T since that almost never happens."
His trade value currently is someone in the CJ McCollum/Malcolm Brogdon/Buddy Hield/D'Angelo Russell category.  Not sure any of those guys put the Sixers over the top though.
Hot take but Malcolm Brogdon might just be a better player. Not worth as much as Simmons due to injuries/age but the Sixers are in the finals if the two were swapped rn.
Its amazing that Simmons has proved he wins and makes teams better and now we talkin bout hes worth fucking Malcolm Brogdon
Why a Westbrook comp of all things?  Suggs is a lot closer to prime George Hill/Malcolm Brogdon/Marcus Smart athletically than Westbrook.  Idk I just don‚Äôt see Suggs being a top 7-8 player in the league but it‚Äôs not impossible.  Kuminga and Scottie Barnes could also be superstars eventually.
"If we‚Äôre doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We‚Äôre lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can‚Äôt think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I‚Äôm leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
"Considering we've already rejected an offer for Malcolm Brogdon, who is frankly pretty comparable to CJ as it is, I think we'll be fine with getting someone better than him in return for Ben."
"Well judging by this list apparently not to any contenders he doesn‚Äôt  You should be rooting for Indiana, Malcolm Brogdon would fit super well with Embiid. His two man game with Greg Monroe was really really nice."
"Well, here is Giannis ""Checks Under His Bed at Night for Jimmy Butler"" Flop-etokounmpo playoff record for everyone to see that he has never even won a legitimate playoff series before this year either:  Beginning of time to 1994: too scared of Jimmy Butler to be born  1994-2013: too scared of Jimmy Butler to come to the NBA  2014: so bad he didnt even play that much and he still cost his team 23 more games than the previous season  2015: peed his pants at the sight of Jimmy Butler's Bulls, lost in 6  2016: so scarred by his encounter with Jimmy Butler he refuses to make the playoffs  2017: Wins Most Improved Player and plays on a superteam with Rookie of the Year (better player than Joel Embiid for context) Malcolm Brogdon and Pistons legend Khris Middleton, still loses to a lowly Raptors team in 6 that got destroyed by Lebron.   2018: Lets his superteam down again to the Baby Celtics missing Hayward and Kyrie in 7 games  2019: After winning MVP because voters felt bad for him despite being on a superteam, barely squeaked by Pistons with an injured Blake Griffin (doesnt count, poor sportsmanship not to wait until Blake got better, but Giannis was scared again), beat the Baby Celtics (doesnt count because I said so), then lost in 6 to some random Canadian team led by some mute guy who hadn't played in two years. Used Brogdon as a scapegoat and Giannis cried until they let Brogdon walk (my uncle works for the Bucks, I know all the inside info and know all the players and wear all the flyest clothes and call the players by their nicknames, it's not a big deal though)  2020: Barely squeaked by Orlando without any of their good players (Doesnt count because Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tmac, and Dwight Howard all didnt play). Lost to the Miami Jimmy Butlers in 5 after being so scared that Giannis refused to finish the series."
"[Malcolm Brogdon on if he would've liked to stay in Milwaukee: ""I would've loved to play for this team if they had wanted me ‚Äî if they had valued me the way the Pacers value me.""](https://twitter.com/BallySportsIN/status/1208899005037498369)"
I don't know? Somebody like Malcolm Brogdon? I see anybody that's just a catch and shoot guy to be a role player. PJ sits in the corner all game and is there to play defense and hustle.
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
Would Malcolm Brogdon be a good pg for the Celtics?
I don‚Äôt know if he would be a good analyst but I think it would be funny to listen to Malcolm Brogdon because he sounds like President Obama
I don‚Äôt see why it means that by default. Was Malcolm Brogdon not on the team? George Hill was solid for you too.
I thought he meant to say Malcolm Brogdon and had to do a double take
"This overlooks the fact that they traded away Malcolm Brogdon. The lineup today could have had another star or key role players if they didn‚Äôt have to trade assets to get Holliday to make up for their botched Brogdon trade.  Just keep Brogdon, then use your trade assets to stack the roster."
He‚Äôs more like Malcolm Brogdon
Didnt Brogdon leave for Indiana in part because of this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2824568-malcolm-brogdon-on-milwaukee-ive-never-lived-in-a-city-this-segregated.amp.html
Either Rondo and D Rose for veterans that play hard  and have good iq  Or Malcolm Brogdon and Tyus Jones/Joe Ingles for extremely efficient do it all types
"Malcolm Brogdon. The player we are all discussing, who is named in the thread title and has the nickname ""The President"" because of his similarities to Barack Obama."
"Simmons had a terrible 2nd round, he‚Äôs still a 2x all star, ROY, top 3 defender, and is worth a lot more win shares than Malcolm brogdon"
"LMAO!  Ben has fallen off so much that a team legit offered Malcolm Brogdon and a mid-first pick for him?!?   Just want to point out yet again that I was told repeatedly how stupid I was for saying the Sixers should offer Simmons and whatever picks/role players it took to get Kawhi, LeBron, Harden, etc. LBJ seemed set on going to LA for reasons not involving basketball, but the Sixers very realistically could have had either of the other two. But, nope. Don't want to give up a young PG that...can't/won't shoot. Better wait until he makes more money, gets older and still can't/won't shoot."
"the 2016 Draft Class had 2 rookie of the years. One is Malcolm Brogdon, the other is Ben Simmons"
"I‚Äôm just not a fan of DLo like most people are. I think he‚Äôs overrated af. He‚Äôs a below average athlete, weak finisher around the rim, can‚Äôt defend, can‚Äôt cut off ball. His shooting is rather inconsistent for a guy that heavily relies on jumpshot.   He‚Äôs a nice role player that can run PnR, hit some floater and 3 here and there but he‚Äôs not the All Star people think All Star supposed to be  In a vacuum I‚Äôll take Malcolm Brogdon and Fred Vanvleet over him"
"Brogdon and a 1st is a steel for Philly. Malcolm is super disrespected and is posting All Star caliber numbers for 2 years now. Also he is very efficient, educated player and have experience in the PO. Is healthy is the only concern. He would be the right fit for Philly too, imho.   For the Pacers it has no meaning to have Simmons. They already aren't a great offensive team."
"yeah it was  Malcolm Brogdon and a 1st round pick, and a 2nd round pick lol not gonna get too much for ben imo"
Malcolm Brogdon is a much better basketball player than Ben Simmons.
"I'm not gonna say that Rick Carlisle was a questionable hire but I wouldn't be surprised if things get worse before they get better.  It takes a certain personality to be able to play for a guy like Rick, Thibs, Pop...a LOT of guys are not built that way and you can usually figure it out quick but it's gonna take some time to get rid of them (Malcolm Brogdon)."
Malcolm brogdon
"Sexton‚Äôs absolutely been improving as a playmaker. Over the regular season, he averaged as many potential assists per game (9.2) as Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic. Over the last fifteen games, he averaged the same number (11.5) as Ricky Rubio and Malcolm Brogdon did this season."
MPJ was hurt lol and Aaron Gordon was trash   Also Giannis still had Middleton who was an all star and Malcolm Brogdon shot 50/40/90
"Khris Middleton is that number 2, problem is they went from Malcolm Brogdon to George Hill to Teague as their backup guard. They need a playmaker off the bench."
I'm being serious is Jrue Holiday even better than Malcolm Brogdon?
He's basically Malcolm Brogdon with hype.
My b I forgot how restricted free agency works. Although NO can seek compensation from a team who signs him to a max at that time and not lose him for nothing like when the Pacers gave Milwaukee a first round pick for signing Malcolm Brogdon in restricted free agency
"I had Jerami Grant there before, but took him out when because I already had Malcolm Brogdon and Lonzo.   Dragic is a fine point guard imo unless he fell off a cliff and I didn‚Äôt notice.  Caris Levert is a great offensive player and is solid on defense.  Bobby portis was just there for spacing and defense, but I‚Äôd probably have Jerami Grant there instead.   Turner is there for his elite rim protection that would allow the rest of the team to be aggressive on defense. After watching how bad the Pacers were without him, it made me realize how much he elevates a defense.   I think it would make the playoffs, but I understand if you think it couldn‚Äôt. I disagree that BI couldn‚Äôt be the best player on a playoff team though."
Throwing 20m at Malcolm Brogdon instead of pursuing Kemba sure does look good in hindsight.
"I remember Kidd benching Brogdon down the stretch of a tight game and I think Khris or somebody walks over and asks him why he‚Äôs on the bench and Malcolm just rolled his eyes and shrugged, like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look at me‚Äù."
Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon hated his guts fwiw
"Y‚Äôall told me Malcolm Brogdon was better than this man, I ain‚Äôt forget"
wonder what it would take to get malcolm brogdon to LA.
"Jerami Grant, Malcolm Brogdon, Aaron Baynes, Taurean Prince. All those guys fetched protected FRPs in Sign &amp; Trade deals."
"Re-sign Caruso, THT, Schr√∂der, and Morris.  Let Harrell and Drummond walk.  Trade Schr√∂der, THT, 2021 1st, and 2027 1st for Malcolm Brogdon.  Sign Dwight (vet min) and Wayne Ellington (MLE).  Brogdon/KCP/LeBron/AD/Gasol  Caruso/Ellington/Kuzma/Morris/Dwight"
"&gt; He certainly wasn't a great coach but Milwaukee showed vast improvement from his first season there to his last season there.  This is just categorically untrue. Everything was worse by the end. In his 1st season, he employed an aggressive, blitzing defensive scheme that led to us having the second-best defensive efficiency rating in the NBA. But the whole league figured it out by his 2nd year and he never changed it. Our defensive rating went from 2nd to 22nd to 19th to 25th at the time he was fired in his last season.  He never improved schematically as a coach and had zero answers when things went wrong. He would always just blame ""energy and effort"" (get used to that phrase) and took to blaming the team's youth for his shortcomings toward the end of his tenure (the roster overall was fairly young, but the core outside of Giannis really wasn't).  And he continued to make some of his most brain-dead decisions up until the very end. There was a game about a month before he was fired where we were up 3 with 1.4 seconds left against Cleveland. He instructed Khris Middleton to intentionally miss his free throw so we could avoid the possibility of a 4-point play. I'm not kidding, that's 100% real. Not long before that, there was a game where we led by 4 against Detroit with 10 seconds left and intentionally fouled career 86% FT shooter Reggie Jackson, justifying it with this gem:   &gt; They‚Äôre trying to play the game of quick twos to save their timeouts, so we‚Äôll just play the free-throw game with them. I believe that my guys will make the free throws. They miss one and it works. It‚Äôs a free-throw game no matter what, but we wanted to send them to the line  He was a dreadful in-game coach from start to finish in Milwaukee and he didn't make up for it by being some phenomenal players' coach. He reportedly wasn't even on speaking terms with Jabari Parker by the end and Malcolm Brogdon barely hid his disdain for Kidd. Giannis liked him, but that says much more about Giannis than Kidd.  Maybe he's learned a lot since then (mostly in terms of player relations, it's extremely difficult for me to imagine him achieving close to competency as an in-game coach) and won't be as much of a disaster as he was here. He wasn't Jim Boylen levels of bad in player management, but I honestly do think this is closer to hiring Boylen than it is a ""shades of gray"" situation like you're saying."
They need to trade Malcolm Brogdon. It's pretty clear he's the problem.  There's only a handful of guys it could be causing issues.   * TJ Warren - unlikely since he balled out in the bubble and during McMillian's tenure. Sounds like he had issues with Bjorkgren but never played under him.  * Sabonis - unlikely because he's blossomed since being in Indiana and was reportedly trying to smooth things out for Bjorkgren.  * Turner - just doesn't have the makeup to be a coach killer.
"Most likely it's Brogdon. He and Oladipo didn't get along, Brogdon didn't like McMillan and the same criticisms of McMillan came up about Bjorkgren. Malcolm seems like one of those guys who is very nice but supremely stubborn and thinks highly of himself."
"Great points, Trae Young with a pick and roll is way more lethal than Malcolm Brogdon on a pick and roll"
"Brogdon left a couple years ago and Jrue just got there so I don't think they could've kept Brogdon and then traded for Jrue without giving up some more contracts. It'd be one thing if they re-signed Malcolm with Bird rights after trading for Jrue, but that wasn't really on the table at the time."
"4 Teamer &amp; Works on Trade Machine:  Raptors:   - Porzingis - Malcolm Brogdon  Mavs:   - Myles Turner  - Rodney Hood  Pacers:  - Kemba Walker - OG Anunoby  OKC:   - Kyle Lowry - Draft Picks (Presti, duh)  Roast me if this is stupid. Thought of this in 2 min. Go Cers."
Malcolm Brogdon is good??
I really hope we don‚Äôt end up with Suggs he‚Äôs so fucking boring and has Malcolm Brogdon written all over him
"You‚Äôre trying to build around the front court rather than Trae. AD is the better player for Trae, younger, more compatible, and covers his defensive weaknesses while being a streaky yet lethal offensive player. You trade away Collins at that point for a guard or wing whose value is similar, like a Malcolm Brogdon or Mikal Bridges"
"I think potentially you could have found 1 team willing to take BI over him, but I can't think of any other player. At the time it's a two player draft. Turns out you got All-stars and All-NBA players like Sabonis, Jaylen Brown, Pascal, Malcolm Brogdon. Otherwise, you got Jamal Murray, Buddy Hiedl, Dejaunte Murray, and Levert. Not a wonderful class there. In fact only Pascal and Ben have been on an All-NBA team."
White outplayed Fox in direct competition at preparation scrimmages.  Fox is a great #1 gunner for an inferior quality team.  Not what was needed.  Needed smart decision making (when to pass vs. shoot vs. dribble) and defense.  Malcolm Brogdon type glue guys.  Or Kyle Anderson with his newfound 3-point stroke.
"A Ben for Malcolm brogdon swap makes the most sense, he fit like a glove for philly. Pacers also ship Sab for another young piece and build around ben caris Myles and the return for Sab. As for philly a lineup of Maxey Brogdon Green Tobi and Joel sounds like a really nice 2 way team, maybe slap tisse in the starting lineup if he develops his shooting."
Conveniently leaving out the centerpiece of Malcolm Brogdon lol.
"&gt;Nates a great coach but they had plateaued so something had to change.   They were building around Malcolm Brogdon and Damontas Sabonis, that's what had to change. I don't know how it's even a question. You look at the players on that roster and the fact that they were a no-brainer playoff team was already an impressive coaching feat."
Who's going to be creating your offense if you trade Sabonis? Malcolm Brogdon?
"Assuming we're only including players form the last 5 years (So no Curry, Klay, Draymond):  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (2016)  SG: Jordan Poole (2019) (Might be KPJ)  SF: Terance Mann (2019)  PF: Isaiah Stewart (2020)  C: Mitchell Robinson (2018)"
"Malcolm Brogdon and Domantis Sabonis, two of the most arrogant figures in the league. Wait what?"
Who else would you have taken in those draft positions though? Malcolm Brogdon instead of Bembry/Prince? It's not like they whiffed on lottery picks.
"My hot take as a Jazz fan has always been that he'd be best next to a do-everything defensively talented combo guard so they could split ballhandling duties. Someone like Malcolm Brogdon or Jrue Holiday. Then you can hide Mitchell on the worst offensive player or match him up with a smaller guard, which he can do a fine job on. I think Mitchell will eventually evolve into a better pure 1, he's showed flashes of better PnR chops and will oftentimes make insanely accurate and fast baseball passes which make me believe that while I don't think he'll ever be CP3 or LeBron levels of playmaking, he can still elevate his game to ""very very good and borderline elite"". I will say his fit with Gobert isn't amazing though because he seems to prefer lower passes like skip passes and bounce passes in PnR situations which Gobert often struggles to catch, and his game is more of a drive-and-kick type of playmaking than traditional pick and roll playmaking that gets unlocked by his absolutely transcendent athleticism and explosiveness ."
"I desperately want a big guard than can defend and hit open threes in the Josh Hart / Malcolm Brogdon / George Hill mold. Just talking type, not availability.  The next step for both Tatum and Brown is to be the primary initiator so I don't think our PG needs to be that guy necessarily. They do need to be competent as a secondary ball handler though and - good god this is important - make better decisions than Marcus Smart."
"Ya that is pretty good considering he is a guard. Think of how many guards you have being all star snubs every year. Even in the east this year we have Bradley Beal, Malcolm Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine. Guards have always been NBA's deepest position."
"As they should man. LeBron drug far more inferior players to the Finals at 22 man, no way he‚Äôs not making the Finals with Malcolm Brogdon, Eric Bledsoe, Jrue Bledsoe &amp; Khris Middleton next to him. Look at what Trae Young is doing rn, Giannis has no excuses &amp; when he loses this series he should get demoted to as the 15th best player in the league."
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It‚Äôs one of the better drafts we‚Äôve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"Derrick White booming on Paul Millsap, and Malcolm Brogdon killing Bron and Kyrie in the same game is up there for sure üòÇüòÇ"
"The Bucks were offering a much better package to the Cavs and yet these guys took the Celtics offer, still pissed about that.  It was basically anyone but Giannis.  Malcolm Brogdon - highly valued at the time.  Khris Middleton - highly valued too.  Thon Maker - highly valued.  Jabari Parker - highly valued.  Picks - highly valued.  These guys really rejected whatever combination of that for what turned out to be Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill (top 10 pick too).   Collin Sexton makes it worth but still, why not take the Bucks package."
Victor Oladipo was considered a late bloomer and made his leap in his year 25 season. Malcolm Brogdon will be 29 in December.
* Tobias Harris  * Malcolm Brogdon  * Nikola Vucevic  * Robert Covington
"You seriously think in 2-4 years Malcolm Brogdon, DeJounte Murray, and Caris LeVert could be considered better than Ben Simmons? This is ridiculous, sorry.  People are criticizing Ben Simmons bc he can't be the second best guy on a finals team. A Sabonis, Brogdon, and LeVert core couldn't even make the playoffs."
Yes but have you considered.  Malcolm brogdon
Celtics:  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (23rd pick in 2016)  SG: Jaylen Brown (3rd pick in 2016)  SF: Jayson Tatum (3rd pick in 2017)  PF: Pascal Siakam (16th pick in 2016)  C: Mitchell Robinson (27th pick in 2018)

"&gt;Makes you have more of an appreciation for pros who get drafted who actually excelled in school.. or at least cared enough to understand the value of it.  Malcolm Brogdon finished his Master's in Public Policy at UVA the same year in which he won both ACC POTY and DPOY and was a 1st-team All-American.   He's a borderline All-Star and will probably never need to use that degree with the money he'll have made by the time he retires, but he still decided it was worth it"

It‚Äôs pretty close tbf https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statspros.com/lamelo-ball-vs-malcolm-brogdon-stats/amp/ I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd count lamelo as better from those stats given that he didn‚Äôt even start for a lot of the season
"Dude also pissed off Malcolm Brogdon and Jabari Parker, I didn‚Äôt realize this was a shock"
"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"
"I think all Morey knows is that Dame is worth trying to wait for the chance to trade for him over his other options. Like, we know that Malcolm Brogdon and picks instead of Ben is not elevating you to championship levels over the Bucks and Nets. Getting an actual perimeter star next to Embiid is the only real path to winning, so you sit on it and see if you can make it happen."
"Saw that Pacers' Malcolm Brogdon's charity is hosting a fundraiser where you can play fantasy football against NBA and WNBA players. They'll have a live draft event on August 26th. Right now the players are Diamond DeShields, Victoria Vivians, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Malcolm Brogdon. https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"

Doubt. I watched all our games last year and tbh I think he has potential to be better than fox given his age. I‚Äôd say worst case is something similar to malcolm brogdon. Best case his game is closest probably to steve nash. The scoring numbers might always be low because he is more passive but it doesn‚Äôt reflect his impact on the offense. He would have won ROY if he was given the freedom to shoot last year like lamelo and edwards.
"Malcolm Brogdon  Jamal Murray  Jonathan Isaac  Jaren Jackson Jr  Myles Turner   An Isaac, Jackson, Turner lineup is my dream. OG and VanVleet coming off the bench."
"This package was denied by Sixers awhile ago, you were saying?  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/pacers/.amp/news/report-the-pacers-tried-to-trade-malcolm-brogdon-and-a-pick-for-76ers-ben-simmons"
Malcolm Brogdon got his eyes on a bigger prize
"There's no logic to this but I'm going to put in Malcolm Brogdon because he's the Prez and he's constantly managing his charity.  I'm also gonna put Steven Adams. He's just smart about how the world works. I don't know if it's smarts or being savvy about the world.  Jeremy Lin, Draymond, and LeBron are a bit more obvious."

Malcolm Brogdon
Malcolm Brogdon  Deserved to be an all-star
Kyle Anderson   Malcolm Brogdon  DeJounte Murray   Jalen Brunson  TJ McConnell
"Fred Vanvleet, Malcolm Brogdon, Mikal Bridges"
What about Malcolm Brogdon? I'd say he is at least top 7 pick in a re-draft now.
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
**G:** DeJounte Murray   **G:** Trae Young   **F:** LaMelo Ball  **F:** Zach LaVine   **C:** Malcolm Brogdon   **Bench:** TJ McConnell / Jalen Brunson / DAngelo Russell / Jamal Murray / Cam Payne
"I agree. Id take a package of Wiseman, Wiggins and Moody/Kuminga and just build a team around Embiid. Then you flip Wiseman and either rookie to get Malcolm Brogdon from Indiana"
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"Then there's guys like Malcolm Brogdon, Draymond, Dame, Steph, Norm Powell who all were 3-4 year college players that continued to get better once in the league."
"Super young/super old rookies make people confused. Malcolm Brogdon is two years younger than Brandon Jennings, for instance."
"Lonzo reminds me a bit of Malcolm Brogdon. A really solid player, but maybe not a piece that gets you over the top. In the right situation, they‚Äôre both good role players though"
Malcolm Brogdon would make sense
"Yea, I‚Äôm sure Embiid would love it if they dumped him for Malcolm Brogdon üôÑ"
"It's pretty wild that the members of the 50/40/90 club in the last decade are Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Malcolm Brogdon, and Kyrie Irving."
"I think FVV is worth slightly less than Simmons, just my opinion.  Similar value to Malcolm Brogdon probably."
"Lonzo has gotten really overrated this offseason. He's making what Malcolm Brogdon is making - let's be real here, he's not nearly as good a scorer, shooter, or defender as Brogdon. In a $112M cap league, Lonzo is not worth $21M of it."
"Evidence your thesis is true. Nothing. No rumoured offer of any of the ""Plenty of teams"" offering anything like you'd pay for a small ball, non-shooting ""center"" piece to build around. Not even the Wolves ! Or the Kings !  Evidence my thesis is true. Only rumoured offer has been Malcolm Brogdon - and I love my President, but he's a backup PG - and *a* first.  Yeah, so you're in love with Simmons. So is Morey. The rest of the league, on the other hand, seems to believe he will not help their basketball teams, given his current salary.  He's staying in Philly, and he'll keep getting dem checks."
"Suggs more of a combo guard like Jrue Holiday and Malcolm Brogdon are  He‚Äôs gonna be a really good on ball defender, over all help disruptor off ball too. He can operate PnR better than Lonzo because he‚Äôs a better driver and finisher, he can hit some really sick head pass in transition nicely too.   What he lacks is off dribble shooting, handles not tight at all or good enough to be a lead guard like Morant or Fox or Trae Young, and his passing accuracy is not that good to be the primary facilitator either."
More athletic Malcolm Brogdon
Malcolm Brogdon was a 5 year player I think if that counts
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
"&gt; Warriors finished the regular season with the 8th best record in the West and then ended up in the first ever play-in tourney.  Any other season and that's a playoff team.    You‚Äôre right I should have said an 8 seed.  &gt;By that logic Malcolm Brogdon and Sabonis are on a lottery team too? Every argument you make you contradict yourself.  They were both the 1st and 2nd best, not the 3rd.  They made the playoffs when they weren‚Äôt being coached by Nate Bjorkgren as a mid-seed, not even a bottom seed. And they didn‚Äôt play with a literal MVP candidate and a DPOY candidate.   If they were the 2nd and 3rd best players behind Steph, the Warriors would have at least been a mid seed.  I‚Äôm not contradicting myself, I‚Äôm just not ignoring the other variables."
"&gt; Kelly Olynyk did that for Houston,   Glad you mentioned Olynyk.  Because he went off in Houston (a tanking team).  Just like Jerami did in Detroit, another tanking team.    The season before both were on above .500 teams and came nowhere close to those numbers.   &gt; Anyone can pump up volume if you don‚Äôt actually care about results.  Couldn't have said it better myself.  Anyone can pump in volume on a tanking team.  Much harder to do when you're competing to win games.        &gt; Wiggins as a teams 3rd best player was still a lottery team last year  Warriors finished the regular season with the 8th best record in the West and then ended up in the first ever play-in tourney.  Any other season and that's a playoff team.    By that logic Malcolm Brogdon and Sabonis are on a lottery team too? Every argument you make you contradict yourself."
Worst rookie of the year is Malcolm Brogdon from 2017.   He averaged 10/2/4
Malcolm Brogdon
Lol some of the guys wanted to trade Wiseman + 7 (Kuminga) for malcolm brogdon...
"Anthony Gill was Virginia basketball legend, he was on the same squad with Malcolm Brogdon and Joe Harris iirc"
"Not uncommon to draft a decent role player or even an all-star at late 1st to early 2nd round (Jimmy Butler 30th, Draymond Green 35th, Joe Harris 33rd, Malcolm Brogdon 36th, Pascal Siakam 27th ...) Chances are really bad by late 2nd round"
Malcolm Brogdon - POTUS
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jvml8y/charania_the_new_orleans_pelicans_are_trading/  The top comments mostly say the Bucks had to go all in to try to keep Giannis, and in my brief scan through the comments don't see much quite like the first part of my comment (though there's ~1400 comments in there, and I doubt I looked at even 10% of them).  But you can find plenty of laughable takes getting upvoted in there.  The first laughable one I can see without expanding any comment threads:  &gt; The thing that is so galling about this is that they had Malcolm Brogdon on the roster. Brogdon isn't as good yet, and may never get there, but he is the exact same player type in a younger body.  177 upvotes, replies saying he's not even close to being the same type of player not upvoted as highly."
Kevin Love - therapist  Malcolm Brogdon - lawyer  Damian Lillard - entrepreneur  Kyrie Irving - political activist  Jonathan Isaac - pastor
Malcolm Brogdon same thing. 2016 draft. 28 year old
"Man, always a nice read. I guess most thought that the Danny Fortson-Tractor Traylor Unit Guys would lay Dray out like a Pancake, but Dray operates differently and just like eveything the warriors touch, it's perfect specifically to them.   Anyways, of the top of my head recommendations are Donoval Mitchell, Malcolm Brogdon, and Andrew Wiggins."
"He‚Äôs smoking the same crack as Schr√∂der. Malcolm Brogdon is far better than both and he‚Äôs getting $21 million, which is fair value."
Malcolm Brogdon won ROY as a second round pick lol
"2009 - Brandon Jennings led a terrible roster to the 6th seed in his rookie year and nearly upset the Hawks (losing in 7). He then got hurt. Despite that he still lead them to the the playoffs 2 out of his 4 seasons and then got traded for Khris Middleton. At #10 this was a good pick.   2009 - Jodie Meeks. A ten year NBA career for a 41st pick is incredible. The average NBA career lasts 4.5 seasons. The average length for a 41st pick would be like 1 year. This was a great pick.   2010 - Larry Saunders at 15 in 2010 was another great pick. In 2012 he was a Gobert-esque rim protector, essentially a walking double double with 3 blocks per game.    2011- Jimmer Fredette. The Kings made this pick. The Bucks had no intention of keeping Jimmer and traded back for the 19th pick, which they used to take eventual borderline All Star Tobias Harris. An incredible pick.    2012 - John Henson at 14. Wasn't awful considering who was drafted after him. Pretty much everyone passed on Draymond who went 35.   2013 - Giannis. One of the best draft picks in NBA history.   2014 - Jabari Parker was considered a sure-fire star and was voted by his draft class as being the most likely to win ROY and to have the best career. Sports Illustrated had him on the cover calling him the ""best High School player since Lebron James'. No one was mad at this pick. He was averaging 20ppg in his 3rd season but had shocking luck with injuries.   2014 - Johnny O'Bryant. 5 years from a 36th pick isn't terrible.   2015 - Rashad Vaughn at 17 wasn't a disaster considering who was left on the board.   2016 - Thon Maker at 10. This is the first one I feel they properly messed up because Sabonis went 11. However they made up for it with their next pick.   2016 - Malcolm Brogdon at 36 is an incredible pick. Rookie of the year, 50-40-90 club, borderline All Star.    2018 - Donte DiVincenzo at 17 was a good pick. Find a new slant."
"Giannis, Malcolm Brogdon, Normal Powell...how exactly is this terrible drafting? Even Jabari Parker was looking like a solid pick until his injury"
"Small thing I want to add  &gt;2016-pick 36 Malcolm Brogdon. This is actually a good pick,  Having a nice starter caliber player for an early second round pick is wonderful value. What you expect an early second round pick to be is  &gt;2016- Pick 38 Pat Mccaw. Traded on draft night for Cash Considerations, a bottom of the bench guy.  McCaw, that's why second round picks are easy to acquire."
Are Malcolm Brogdon and buddy hield even in the same tier
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
"As they shouldn't.  Beal is better right now but I don't think it's really ludicrous to believe that Juice could be the better player by the end of his current contract.  Beal isn't enough of an upgrade to immediately vault us to top contender status either, especially if Washington were to ask for any additional assets, so moving Brown in a deal for him just kind of feels like making a trade for the sake of making a trade.  Ideally, you bring in Beal to accompany the Jays with some sort of package like Timelord, Smart, a couple of the younger guys, and a fleet of picks, but since quite a few teams can outbid that, I just don't see Beal to Boston being realistic unless he takes a massive steamy player empowerment dump all over the Wizards' chests.  Boston likely doesn't have a path to a championship if Tatum doesn't become a clear top 10 player no matter what, so the best thing to do IMO is bank on the two All Stars and try to build out a strong core around them.  If we could find a way to snag someone in the mold of a Malcolm Brogdon, I think it would go a long way in unlocking both of their games."
"Lakers- if I could guarantee full health, Jamal Murray and Malcolm Brogdon   If health can‚Äôt be confirmed, SGA and Brogdon"
"Malcolm Brogdon, famous playoff contributor"
"Kyrie is 29. Drafted in 2011, and born in the same year as Malcolm Brogdon, drafted in 2016."
If you trade Simmons for some Malcolm Brogdon type you go from losing in the second round to losing in the first round.  There‚Äôs no point.
"Yeah, it struck me how personally hurt he was after Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon left the team in free agency. He viewed those guys as his brothers, even though they probably weren't the missing pieces he needed. He also showed extreme loyalty to Jason Kidd and even Joe Prunty."
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let‚Äôs see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He‚Äôs averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he‚Äôs not super-efficient, his numbers don‚Äôt contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren‚Äôt great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don‚Äôt hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year‚Äôs trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that‚Äôs it. He can‚Äôt pass the ball at a high level and he‚Äôs a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
"I mean, I'm pretty sure all the dirt about Kidd was all out in the open well before Cuban hired him, unless someone somewhere has an NDA we haven't heard about.  I guess the closest thing to unsubstantiated ""dirt"" on him from his time in Milwaukee was that he was definitely not over his alcohol issues, at least according to multitudes of rumors from people who worked in Milwaukee area bars.  And given the way he coached the team, it's not out of the question he might have been inebriated out on the court at some points.  (The game where he forgot to put in Malcolm Brogdon for the entire first half, then played him the entire second half comes to mind.  And of course, the famous ""intentionally miss a free throw while up 3 points with 3 seconds left, because he was more scared of a four point play than a ~half-court three-pointer...."" debacle.)"
That's Malcolm Brogdon
He looks like Malcolm Brogdon
People say he plays like Malcolm Brogdon
"Well, I wouldn't tell a player to intentionally miss a free throw up 3 points with 3 seconds left.  And I wouldn't forget that I had Malcolm Brogdon sitting on my bench for an entire half, for no reason.  And then play him the *entire* second half with no breaks after I'm reminded.  So I've got that going for me, which is nice."
"I‚Äôve been saying he looks like Malcolm Brogdon üòÇ and people wouldn‚Äôt see it, guess I‚Äôm not the only one"
Is that... Malcolm Brogdon? lmao
Malcolm brogdon thanks
Back when Malcolm Brogdon was also in these commercials...
"I think if he was next to a point guard like Derrick White or Malcolm Brogdon that can handle the ball and create for himself and others and can guard bigger guys than most point guards, he could do great. The problem with Sexton though is that the cavs also have Garland who is a good player but defensively it's not ideal to play them both."
"The Nets would be better off trading Kyrie for someone like Malcolm Brogdon. At least he would actually play during the season and wouldn't get hurt in the playoffs like Kyrie does every single year.  I doubt any team would take that trade. Kyrie is a headcase and a massive liability getting paid max dollars. At this point he is a negative, not an asset."
Sixers win the East easily with a point guard who can shoot 3s and FTs.  Embiid will be so much more dominant if he doesn't have a 6'10'' point guard hiding under the basket on offense.  Just give him Derrick White / Malcolm Brogdon type of guards
"And nobody used that rationale cause it leads to the complete prioritization of 3 and D players. For example, I‚Äôm pretty sure 90% of teams would take brook lopez over valancunis, Capela, Vucevic and co. Would you consider him a better player ? Most teams would take a jrue holiday, Malcolm brogdon or Kyle Lowry over Russ. Are they better players ? Just wanna see how consistent your logic is.  And white is a pretty average 3 point shooter."
Chris Paul and Malcolm Brogdon.  Basically the same guy.
"&gt;Interesting that you laugh at the sixers attempting to make the team better yet assume that Malcolm brogdon attending training camp is the difference between championship and bust.  There you go again... lying about what I said. Going all the way back to my first post that you responded to in this thread, I've been saying all along that a deal trading Simmons for Brogdon !AND! the Pacers first round pick (which Philly could've traded for a decent vet) was a deal worth pursuing, not Brogdon alone. The fact that you have to misrepresent what I say to try and make a point speaks to how little faith you have in your own position.  But the main reason I bumped this discussion is to say that here we are two weeks later (a week before training camp) and the situation is getting worse between Ben and the Sixers, not better. Lillard's even declared that he is staying in Portland this season.  My question to you is this: looking back over all that's happened and the uncertainty of the future, are you willing to admit that it would've been better to have taken Brogdon !AND! the first round pick before he was selected to trade for a vet? Maybe even see if the Pacers would throw in another decent piece like Warren? Wouldn't that have been better than the mess going on now, and give the 76ers to chance to laser focus on a championship with nothing else detrimental going on?"
"would love more insight on your comment, and those like it:      1) are we sure Morey is the source on these ""hes asking for the moon"" reports and not other teams?      2) if Morey said ""yeah I just want Malcolm Brogdon but would settle for Caris Levert"" does *that* then drive a bidding war? I personally don't think so      3) the Sixers aren't contenders with a role player replacing Ben Simmons. In fact we just saw a playoff series where Ben's decision making effectively made him not a star but a role player, so idk why people want Morey to just seek a non-star and expect success"
"You boo'd Santa! It was another eagles fan too, and you guys bood him and threw snowballs at him. That's the worst example but let's not pretend like 76ers fans didn't boo Tony Snell for the crime of Malcolm Brogdon not playing and them just being riled up. It goes beyond expecting the best from your players and you know it."
"&gt; Sixers fans don‚Äôt mess around. I remember a bunch of them travelled to Milwaukee to boo Malcolm Brogdon  That seems like the definition of ""messing around"":  **Definition of _mess around_**  **1** : to waste time  [Link](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mess%20around)"
"Teams I got: Bucks, Lakers, Pacers, Heat, Thunder, Nuggets, Raptors.  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (4th) SG: Tyler Herro (5th) SF: Michael Porter jr (3rd) PF: Giannis (1st) C: Anthony Davis (2nd) 6th: Gary Trent Jr (6th) 7th: Poku (7th)  Hopefully I did this right, the decision between Lebron/Giannis/Jokic was tough but I ended up taking Giannis, I understand if you think the other two were better options."
"John wall is making 40 million and is severely washed.hypothetically,  Do you really think sixers would even do that? I rather just take the malcolm brogdon indy trade than trade for john wall"
"Starters: Curry/Paul George/Tatum/Giannis/Capela   Bench: Malcolm Brogdon/Wiggins/RoCo/MPJ/Myles Turner  Monte Morris/Marcus Smart  I tried not to go too crazy with the players. Most of them are decent defenders, and the versatility both on offense and defense is insane. The starting lineup is centered around the gravity of Steph and Giannis, who can create open looks for PG and Tatum. Capela is there mostly for defense, to provide a strong paint protector who‚Äôs still decently switchable. The bench lineup is much of the same, and can function both on its own or mixed in with the starters. I also included two solid backup guards in case Curry hurts his ankle ‚òπÔ∏è."
Assuming everyone is healthy all 82 games like the post mentioned  PG: Jrue Holiday SG: Bradley Beal (all star) SF: Paul George (all star) PF: Kevin Durant (superstar) C: Joel Embiid (superstar)   Bench PG: Jamal Murray SG: Malcolm Brogdon SF: OG Anunoby PF: Christian Wood C: Clint Capela
"Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Malcolm Brogdon and Grayson Allen"
"Imma throw Malcolm Brogdon in the mix as well, obviously not as good as PG but maybe that makes him even more ""default"""
I'll say Malcolm Brogdon for shits and giggles
I can make this team out of Bucks front office decisions of the 2000‚Äôs  PG: Malcolm Brogdon  SG: John Salmons  SF: Jabari Parker  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Tim Thomas  8 seed potential for sure
Cj. A variety of good role players like Beasley bev mcdaniels and co. Collin sexton. Fred VanVleet. Malcolm brogdon.  And Houston is likely a bottom 5 seed this year. Why would they trade their pick unprotected ?
"CJ, .Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, D'Angelo Russell  They could also get Sexton, but that means they will have to take on Love's contract as well."
"Cries in Phoenix Suns.  We took Dragan Bender 4th above Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield.  We took Marquese Chriss 8th above Domontas Sabonis, Paskal Siakam and Caris Lavert.  We took Tyler Ulis 34th above Malcolm Brogdon."
1.	Jaylen Brown 2.	Jamal Murray 3.	Ben Simmons 4.	Pascal Siakam 5.	Brandon Ingram 6.	Domantas Sabonis 7.	Dejounte Murray 8.	Fred VanVleet 9.	Malcolm Brogdon 10. Caris LeVert 11. Jakob Poeltl 12. Buddy Hield
malcolm brogdon.  he woulda been a perfect sixth man for the bucks but wasnt going to accept that role.  i think you go and you do what a team asks and you do it the best you can.  imagine this champs squad with brogdon around.  i think his stock would be way higher rn.   as is he seems like a high volume point guy who is a bit slower than the rest.  there are still alot of people who think brogdon has what it takes to lead.  im just not one. if the bucks thought he could be that they wouldnt have traded him in division
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"Assuming this is ""guards that didn't make the All star team last season but are really good"" (MPJ makes no sense of course), let's put Jrue Holiday in for MPJ.  1. Young 2. Fox 3. Holiday 4. Murray 5. SGA 6. Ja 7. LaMelo  Though LaMelo isn't that far away.  And if you add Colin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White, I still have LaMelo at 7."
Malcolm Brogdon and the 13th pick was a solid offer.
I could see Pacers fans turning on Malcolm Brogdon
"It's always fair to ask for sources, no worries. The one that stands out to me the most is Brogdon and multiple first round picks. The 76ers rejected that one.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10006949-report-ben-simmons-trade-for-pacers-malcolm-brogdon-1st-rounder-rejected-by-76ers"
"As a Malcolm Brogdon fan, I am okay with this trend"
"Your entire comment is about how the sixers are giving up the season. They haven't given up anything yet.  Trying to get the best deal possible is not anyone vs Ben. No one is acting against Ben, there just trying to act in the best interest of the sixers. I understand that this is r/NBA but in real life it's not always a soap opera.  You're heavily overestimating the value of training camp. Interesting that you laugh at the sixers attempting to make the team better yet assume that Malcolm brogdon attending training camp is the difference between championship and bust. I guess we're all getting a good laugh today."
"Are you under the impression that the season has already started? There's a lot of time between the start of free agency and the start of the season.  It's not Morey's pride vs Simmons pride. They're lining up for a run at a player like Dame. Even if the odds aren't great and it ends up not working out, you make that attempt 10 times out of 10 especially if the only drawback is getting Malcolm brogdon a few weeks later if you fall.  Ben is a young talented socialite who will only be a young talented socialite for a few more years. It's silly to think he has more time and leverage than the sixers. And like I said, it's not about screwing Ben, they're just trying to get a better deal.  Sixers fans haven't suffered anything yet. I already said that if we're well into the regular season and the Ben situation is still unresolved then I'll agree the sixers fucked up, but that's a long time from now"
Then people should have zero problem that he's demanding to be traded. If Ben Simmons is an irreparable loser then just 1 for 1 trade him for Malcolm Brogdon and be happy with a great return.
"Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, both bogdanovich‚Äôs"
Like who? Brogdon?  Per 538 he's a negative contract. They have him worth 14 a year and he's currently making 21.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/malcolm-brogdon/
"Zan the man. Never fails. I think Jalen Suggs is a great bet at +650. He might be their best player. If we see a Malcolm Brogdon type winner, I could see it being Duarte or Bones Hyland."
&gt;Rookie of the year doesn‚Äôt mean incredible career  Going over the list it usually does mean that it seems. Guys like Tyreke and Malcolm Brogdon are outliers.
Malcolm Brogdon  Jimmy Butler  Mikal Bridges  LeBron James  Myles Turner  6th man Eric Gordon
"If they didn‚Äôt take Malcolm Brogdon, they definitely not taking that trade"
Y'all people on this reddit are ridiculous. Haliburton will never be as good as Simmons. He is Malcolm Brogdon 2.0.
"It's inaccurate to say that all we know of rookies is their statlines. James Harden had significantly better signs of isolation scoring and three-point creation, was stronger and had much better athleticism, and showed signs of making tough execution passes both in transition and in the halfcourt. He also only played 22 minutes in 0 starts where Haliburton played 30, so tossing his statline out there without adjusting for minutes played is misleading.  Haliburton's stats mostly came off good secondary role execution. Lots of spot-up threes, some good passing to cutters and rollers, some but not a huge amount of playmaking in transition, very few isolation attempts, very little self-creation, and the creation for others was limited in its depth (e.g., does not have the speed to consistently create off a drive/kick). Not a great point of attack defender and sometimes finds himself out of position.  When you view the game film, it's not nonsensical. It's a whole years worth of footage showing what he's good at and what he has potential in. His skillset (i.e. skillset, not potential) is moreso Malcolm Brogdon than James Harden or Luka Doncic. Maybe someone like Mike Conley if he puts it together really well defensively. Again, easily a top 5 player in this class. But if it's not fair to say his upside is limited, it's not fair to assume - as everyone seems to be - that he's already an all-star/all-NBA lock. It's a just a little pre-emptive."
Malcolm Brogdon offer was better
&gt; Yeah I think that's the best trade Philly could hope for now.   Yep. He and Malcolm Brogdon are my two favorite realistic players we could receive in a Ben trade.
"They should have taken that Malcolm Brogdon, filler, and a first offer but ok"
"Barrett, Tyler Herro, Sexton.  Desmond Bane will have an exceptional career.  Isaiah Stewart will help lead Detroit back to the playoffs.   Malcolm Brogdon will finish a season top-10 in mvp voting"
Malcolm Brogdon is related to Queen Latifah
"idk, none of the leadership are repped by him or clutch sports, and malcolm brogdon is a VP and repped by the same crew as CP3 who we know is influential in the union. could be a bad time for rich paul."
I‚Äôll give a hot take one. Malcolm Brogdon
"&gt;  Malcolm Brogdon, DeAaron Fox  Those are two very different types of guards, haha"
"Malcolm Brogdon, The president"
"""The President"" - Malcolm Brogdon"
"But the thing is at this point he seems easily switchable, wether he's at the 1 or the 4, is there any screen action where you're like ""shit can't switch that"" besides maybe super small point guards ?   Like are you even worried about it if say Malcolm Brogdon or Westbrook have to switch onto him ?"
It's the latter. He was extremely convinced guys like Jabari Parker and Malcolm Brogdon would never leave the team. He couldn't fathom it when they wanted out.
Malcolm Brogdon
"The Kings were never going to trade Fox for Simmons, just like the Blazers were never going to trade Dame for him. As the season approaches Morey is going to have to come off of this. After last year‚Äôs playoffs no team is going to pay his desired price for Simmons because he plays well in the regular season.   These reports are going to slowly stop popping up between now and October and he‚Äôll end up taking CJ McCollum or another similarly skilled guard (Malcolm Brogdon?) before the season begins."
11. LaMelo Ball 12. Mike Conley 13. Fred VanVleet 14. Malcolm Brogdon 15. Lonzo Ball 16. Kyle Lowry 17. D'Angelo Russell 18. Spencer Dinwiddie 19. Kemba Walker 20. Terry Rozier 21. Derrick Rose 22. Dejounte Murray  EDIT: I swear I wrote out 11-22 numbers but reddit doesn't like starting lists at 11?
"Malcolm Brogdon, 20-5-5 player who plays good defense and can shoot the 3. If the Pacers decide to blow it up, the Sixers should go hard for Brogdon"
"Actual underrated players, not just hipster shit:  James Harden  Gordon Heyward  Karl-Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons  Clint Capela  RJ Barrett  Anthony Edwards  Terry Rozier  Malcolm Brogdon"
"one of Warren &amp; Brogdon along with Lamb is probably about right, if the Blazers want both they likely need to include picks + Anfernee Simons.  I actually think that LeVert + CJ would be fine together in the back-court. LeVert has good size, both of them can create their own shot and Sabonis still does so much of the play-making for the Pacers it wouldn't hurt too badly to be without a ""traditional"" PG.  Also McCollum is under contract which is something the Pacers value since it's about as hard to draw free-agents to Indiana as it is to get them to come to Portland.  On the flip-side, pairing Dame with TJ Warren would be great, the Blazers have always needed a wing that can get their own shot and a back-court pairing with Brogdon would be a nice fit as well since Malcolm plays good defense and can ease the play-making load for Dame."

"I'll go with an uncommon choice, Malcolm Brogdon.  Really like his game and he's always under the radar with extremely solid performance.  Always makes the right read."
"What's the best (realistic, in terms of contracts/roles/ego) set of complimentary players to pair with Luka, for a team where he is clearly the best player? (E.g., I'm not including lineups where he teams up with other MVP-level players.)  Would you roll out two guards with him, or an extra wing? I feel like a heliocentric Luka team would need to focus on 3&amp;D role players.   We all know Cuban has coveted Klay for a long time and he's obviously the best complimentary piece to just about any star. Who else? Maybe Malcolm Brogdon for 3&amp;D plus secondary playmaking? Then add Robert Covington as a forward and Clint Capela as a defense/PNR dynamo?   Brogdon/Klay/Luka/RoCo/Capela is probably the best ""realistic"" team you could assemble around Luka, where he is the best player/center of the team. Anyone think they have a better one?"
"I would definitely hang my hat on the percentages seeing as how Randle has shot at least 50 percent from the field twice in his career and Sabonis is 53% overall for his career. Similar 3 point percentages and the exact same amount of assists. Also, Randle has played with better teammates. Currently has a better squad in general to relieve him from carrying that entire stress load. Indy is relying on injury prone Malcolm Brogdon, a rookie, 2 wings that are never healthy and a defensive player that is a streaky shooter with no post game. Sabonis HAS to carry that."
"Malcolm ""The President"" Brogdon being VP feels wrong."
"Malcolm Brogdon has the goatee of a man who took an IQ test once and thinks his 105 score makes him the smartest man in every room.  Also Thanasis‚Äô tattoos (and probably a few other people I‚Äôm forgetting), it bothers me when people have their whole forearm done and nothing above the elbow. I don‚Äôt know why."
Just wait until Kidd leaves him on the bench and forgets to play him completely like he did to Malcolm Brogdon in MKE.

Oh man they should have gotten Brogdon when they had the chance. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre really lamenting the missed opportunity of championship player Malcolm Brogdon. All-NBA talent Malcolm Brogdon. Put a guy like THAT next to Embiid and they‚Äôll be right back in contention
"The Sixers‚Äô goal is to maximize their chances of winning a championship, not to get the best average return for Simmons. Maybe the reality is they need a lopsided trade to get there. If you think the way they get there is by locking into a team with Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert, then you‚Äôre just wrong."
"On offense sure, but defense is a thing.   You‚Äôre not replacing an all nba defender, 3x all star all nba player and our best play maker with Malcolm brogdon or CJ.   You would need at least one perennial all star and a top level role player."
Acquiring Malcolm brogdon or CJ McCollum is not maximizing Embiid‚Äôs prime.
[Lavert + Brogdan](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/15/sixers-not-interested-in-pacers-offer-of-malcolm-brogdon-caris-levert/)  There are several articles about the offer. Google is your friend.
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
Malcolm Brogdon
Malcolm Brogdon sounds like Barack Obama
"Bogdanovic trade fuck up, not matching Malcolm Brogdon, fucking up the Pat Connaughton contract, DJ Augustin contract even though that worked out,"
"&gt;‚ÄúThey incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and they incarcerate black people about five times as much as white people in this country,‚Äù says Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon    sigh"
*sign and trading Malcolm Brogdon
"PUTNAMVILLE, Ind. ‚Äî The Indiana Pacers made a trip to the Putnamville Correctional Facility on Thursday. The entire team held conversations with inmates about life on the inside, and racial disparities in the justice system.  ‚ÄúThey incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and they incarcerate black people about five times as much as white people in this country,‚Äù says Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon, ‚ÄúTo be able to come in here, and see the humanity in people, people who have made mistakes, people who haven‚Äôt made mistakes, and are in here innocent, it gives you a sense, or a feeling of sadness. You come in here, and you see so many able, smart, brilliant men and women behind bars when they shouldn‚Äôt be. I think God has put us on this earth to help each other any way you can. Right now, it‚Äôs my job to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen, and to make sure the system changes so that it‚Äôs not targeting black men and women.‚Äù  The players also coached a game between inmates. The sides were led by Pacers stars Myles Turner and Brogdon. It became apparent as the game began that one player rose above the rest literally and figuratively. Travion Qualls is a 25-year-old inmate from Elkhart, Indiana. He gets out in two years after completing a six-year sentence for being an accessory to a robbery. Before his arrest, he spent two years playing college basketball at Manchester University.  ‚ÄúI played college ball, high school ball, but this moment right here, this ranks number one,‚Äù says Qualls, who put on a show in front of the Pacers and other residents at the correctional facility, ‚ÄúFor people to show that they care, that there are still people fighting for me, it means the world to me. I just want to learn from my mistakes, and just because you make a mistake, it doesn‚Äôt define who you are because you‚Äôre in prison. Moments like this make me want to be better. It gives me the drive to wake up every day to be a better son, a better husband.‚Äù  Qualls also looked back on his sentence of six years and added that another white inmate received half of the time for doing a similar crime.  ‚ÄúMade me see the inequality in the justice system,‚Äù says Qualls, ‚ÄúThey wanted me to put myself in a position to tell on somebody to go home, but my pride wouldn‚Äôt let me. When I get out that makes me want to fight for people in my spot.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs athletes, we experience [racial bias] on a very small basis. These people experience this every day,‚Äù says Turner, ‚ÄúHearing these stories, hearing what they are going through, it makes you want to advocate for change. There was a brother in here that got charged with possession of cocaine, and he got 50 years. That‚Äôs excessive. He didn‚Äôt do any harm to others.‚Äù  The players also heard about the Last Mile Program. The California-based organization provides tech classes for inmates. The lessons range from web development to software engineering.  ‚ÄúIf I push myself to achieve then I can accomplish what I want to achieve‚Äù,‚Äù says Brandon Patterson, who is in the program and has been in jail for 17 years for robbery, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my personal ambition to get a degree in computer science.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNow we have graduates that are part of the program coming back inside virtual. Now they see someone they were sitting next to have a successful career,‚Äù explains Chris Redlitz, co-founder of The Last Mile, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had people hired by Zoom and DropBox and Square.‚Äù"
"Yes, a slightly worse Malcolm Brogdon type of numbers. He was good 6th-man of his time , so compare him to the current 6, not stars."
"So instead of maxing your own draft pick, you should trade him on a rookie contract and max out Malcolm Brogdon because he's high-character?   I think you're just high."
"Fred Van Vleet, Malcolm Brogdon, both Bogdanovics, Lonzo, Scary Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes.  All very high character good players who can be on the floor at the highest levels of the playoffs without being a liability who were available on the market as non-max players.  I'd rather overpay them a bit and trade away a questionable guy with better talent and not max Ben Simmons/D-Lo/Wiggins/John Wall."
"Everyone is always worried about ruining a team's relationship with future free agents.    Presumably, free agents want to get paid.  If you are willing to be the top bidder for (non-max) free agents, they will go to you.  You could have a horrible image as a franchise...if you had max cap space and offered Fred Van Vleet, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Malcolm Brogdon a four-year, 25% max contract in free agency with 5% raises, they'd sign with you.  You'd be offering them more than anyone else did.  And you'd get a high-character, highly-skilled good player."
Malcolm Brogdon shot 50/40/90 should he have been maxed too?
"Question from NBA.com‚Äôs GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix ‚Äì 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers ‚Äì 14%  3. T.J. McConnell, Indiana ‚Äì 10%  4. Mike Conley Utah ‚Äì 7% Udonis Haslem, Miami ‚Äì 7% Garrett Temple, New Orleans ‚Äì 7%  &gt; Also receiving votes: Harrison Barnes, Sacramento; Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana; Draymond Green, Golden State; Joe Ingles, Utah; LeBron James, Lakers; Patty Mills, Brooklyn"
"if you compare their stats, malcolm brogdon is probably the most realistic comparison. but obviously that doesn't do it justice does it. probably like harden, just not as prolific of a scorer, albeit just as if not more efficient. i would say around 22 or 23 ppg with 10ast. definately a top 3 pg"
"Because all star teams are popularity contests? And there are plenty of people that make all nba/all star teams because of defense, for example Gobert last year. Or like Ben Simmons, who averages like a 15/7/7. Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green are all guys that have gotten all nba honors based off of their defense.   Guys like Thybulle and Roberson don't get on their because there are players like them that are also better on offense, i.e. Kawhi/PG13/Butler/CP3. Same reason that guys like Rudy Gay or CJ McCollum or Malcolm Brogdon aren't making it despite having 20+ppg scoring. There are players that do what they do better plus other stuff better"
"""Philadelphia has been unmoved by the Pacers' ability to offer Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert"" Ability to offer..? Lmao  what is this shit. I'm guessing the Pacers didn't even make this offer. This is just the media trying to bump Ben's price and keep him relevant."
"Eh  I see the injury concerns with those two, but I also don‚Äôt think Ben Simmons is the most durable player either (missed entire rookie year, significant time last 2 seasons including the 2020 playoffs).  I think for an ability perspective, Malcolm Brogdon is on the same tier as Ben Simmons come playoff time. So swapping those two plus getting a 20+ scorer in Levert would be a easy move for Philly considering the lack of options they have right now. I think surrounding a MVP candidate in Embiid (who I think will benefit from the better spacing the two bring in) with 3 20+ scorers would make a Philly a real contender again"
If you're trying to build a contender I would say Malcolm Brogdon (or any slightly better than average starting PG in the league) &gt; Westbrook.

To me his trade value is now like a Malcolm brogdon and a pick or Cj McCollum To me ideal scenario for the sixers jow is to add assets with ben and get an allstar calibre perimeter creator..Ben and a pick for someone like DeAaron Fox .or if finally Beal or lillard ask lut him and other assets for them..I dont see them getting anywhere close to his own value at this rate..  To me the kings solution or a swap for Diangelo russell is the most exciting.. obviously because of how both teams require a defensive anchor and have shooters to surround him with
"That's not really what he said though.  ""The Blazers and Pacers have lead guards in CJ McCollum and Malcolm Brogdon who could entice the 76ers in a potential package but neither has gained traction for Philadelphia""  \---Video Cuts---  ""The 76ers I'm told asked the Trail Blazers for three 1st round picks and three draft swaps as part of a potential package but Portland reject that proposal""  That's exactly what he said at 1:41, the first comment is more of a general comment while the second is actual news and doesn't mention CJ."

I didn't know Malcolm Brogdon was a superstar
Malcolm Brogdon is a toploftical player in the league and Caris Levert is a top banana.
"Steph Curry, Giannis, KAT, Embiid, Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Mike Conley, Malcolm Brogdon‚Ä¶tons of really intelligent and thoughtful people excel in this league. The Kyrie Irvings of the world are just always louder.  I really wanted to put the Lopez twins in there too but the list can‚Äôt be all Bucks lol"
Lmao Lowry/VanVleet/Anunoby/#4 to Caris LeVert and Malcolm Brogdon.
"I personally don't believe Simmons is the best solution either, but there are other trades that could be made. I don't see the harm in looking at a Malcolm Brogdon trade or something along those lines."

"Whenever the question is ""best-worst player"" or ""worst-best player"" the answer is usually Malcolm Brogdon."
"I think Brogdon would do better than 0/11 in a do-or-die Game 7 though, so points Malcolm."
Malcolm Brogdon
"If they chose the best possible player with the best fit at every pick every year? Probably a lineup of  Ben Simmons  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  With guys like Mikal Bridges, Dejountae Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Thomas Bryant, Robert Williams off the bench."
"Here‚Äôs a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions‚Äô moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell‚Äôs deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn‚Äôt want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they‚Äôd just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You‚Äôd be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren‚Äôt gaining assets for it."
"Malcolm Brogdon is 28 (2016 Draft, 2016 ROTY)  Ben Simmons is 25 (2016 Draft, 2017 ROTY)"
"Malcolm Brogdon, Caris Levert, Tj Warren, Myles Turner"
"A weird one that sticks out to me is that (from oldest to youngest) Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, Anthony Davis, and Bradley Beal are all 28 years old. Beal is the youngest of the four? And even moreso, Michael Kidd Gilchrist is younger than ALL OF THEM üòÇ"
Malcolm Brogdon and Buddy Hield are only a couple months younger than Bismack Biyombo
"I really want everything you say about Butler to be true, but I think calling him a top-5 draft steal of the decade is kind of pushing it when this decade also has players like Rudy Gobert (27), Draymond Green (35), Jimmy Butler (30), Nikola Jokic (41), Malcolm Brogdon (36) and Pascal Siakam (27). That's five all-stars, four of whom are on a trajectory to being in the Hall of Fame, and a *very good* starting PG in Brogdon who is right on the cusp of being like a 15th or 14th all-star in a weaker conference.   I really want Butler to be that good, and I think he definitely *can* be, it's clear he's extremely talented, but I also think that saying he's ""already"" a top 5 draft steal of the decade is **very** premature, especially when you consider that we haven't even seen the first few years of guys who were drafted late in the 1st or mid into the 2nd round in the last couple of years. There might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now, and making a comparison with Butler to those guys who haven't had much of a chance to emerge is somewhat of a leap imho."
Malcolm Brogdon or CJ do it for you if those got done? I don't think they have Ben potential but what good is potential if you don't live up to it? One of my best friends is a 6ers fan and I like talking to 6ers fans about this stuff cause you obviously have a much better take than the media but they're just aren't that many of you around me.
who says CJ is even available. There's no evidence Malcolm Brogdon was ever even offered. The only legit deal is the scrap that Minnie is offering.
Malcolm Brogdon
"Could have tried to work a sign and trade with Lowry or Lonzo involving CJ. Malcolm Brogdon, Dajaunte Murray, and Marcus Smart could all be available in CJ deals as well. I wouldnt say those players dont exist"
Should just take the package they were offered around malcolm brogdon
"Malcolm Brogdon + a first has been offered and he‚Äôs a better passer, vastly better defender, and has similar shooting splits to CJ, at least in this last season. Not trying to argue just pointing out there has been a player of similar impact that has already been offered - that was before all this training camp stuff tbf"

"[I got down voted](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pjn7tq/comment/hbxstpf/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and went into an extended argument with a Philly fan when I said pre-season that the 76ers GM should've swallowed his pride and traded Ben Simmons to the Pacers for their offer of Malcolm Brogdon and the #13 pick.  Brogdon later signed an extension so he cannot be traded any more this season, and that pick was used to get the outstanding prospect of Chris Duarte. The 76ers could've had two players helping them compete for a championship without the animosity being spewed all around.  Brogdon is a distributing PG that can shoot and plays solid D, and if they didn't want a rookie during their run for a title this season they could've traded the #13 pick pre-draft for a contributing vet."
"&gt;But I've seen Bird tear teams apart with his shooting prowess in was that LeBron never could.  So he‚Äôs a better scorer because he‚Äôs a better shooter? I didn‚Äôt know point from jumpshots mattered more than points at the rim. Somebody better tell shaq and Giannis they‚Äôre not high level scorers. What does it matter how someone tears a team apart? If a player could just dunk their way to 30ppg, what makes that less dominant or makes them an inferior scorer than someone who puts up 35ppg shooting jumpers?   &gt;As demonstrated by his legendary 40/50/90 season.  Also in the 50-40-90 club are Malcolm Brogdon and Kyrie Irving. Do you also think they‚Äôre better scorers than lebron?   &gt;I love them both, but LeBron's per-game average certainly doesn't mean he's a better scorer, it just means he got more shots and was healthy longer. I'm not sure what other case there could be made for LeBron being a better scorer than Bird.  Literally every high level scorer took a lot of shots. Do you think Jordan, kd, Kobe, etc just magically scored all their points without taking a bunch of shots? This is just ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

"His value will continue to plummet. At the beginning of last season, he was the center piece in a potential Harden trade. At the end of last season, you could‚Äôve gotten CJ McCollum and assets. By the middle of the offseason, it became Malcolm Brogdon and a pick. I haven‚Äôt heard any offers recently but I imagine it‚Äôs only gotten worse."
"The narrative you‚Äôre pushing needs to stop. CJ McCollum and Malcolm Brogdon(which were the initial people offered for Ben) are the exact kind of player you specified the Sixers need back yet the team turned their noses up at them and pretty much said ‚Äúif he isn‚Äôt Dame we don‚Äôt want him‚Äù. The Sixers aren‚Äôt gonna get a Dame tier player by holding Ben hostage for the remainder of his contract. Ironically, not trading Ben now causes the same exact issue you claim the Sixers should be avoiding because without Ben Embiid has a bigger work load on offense and defense. The optimum trade package in this situation would be for the Sixers to get back a scoring guard that can facilitate, plus some role players, and a few first round picks too for insurance in case things go left."

There was discussion of Curry winning MVP AND MIP in the same season ‚Äî and it made some sense. Doesn‚Äôt have ROTY though so will never happen. Maybe if Malcolm Brogdon stays healthy and drinks some of Michael‚Äôs Secret Sauce and has an MVP level season to at least win MIP
"They‚Äôd have to have a Malcolm Brogdon style RotY, a thoroughly disappointing sophomore campaign and then break out in their third year as a 6MOtY and MIP. Then develop into an MVP/DPOY caliber player. The 10/3/4 line he won ROTY with is probably the lowest realist line, and leaves just enough space to win 6th man and MIP with something like 22/5/6 off the bench. His career would pretty much have to be if Lou Williams had a great rookie year and then also turned into Gary Payton defensively in his prime."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."

"Pacers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Payton Pritchard  * Bruno Fernando (filler)   * 2021, 2023 Celtics 1sts  Celtics get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Domantas Sabonis  Celtics upgrade with great players in their prime. Brogdon/Smart/Tatum/Horford/Sabonis is really great and solves their ball movement issue.   Pacers retool to get younger and acquire a young star in Brown. Duarte/Brown/Levert/Turner/Williams is pretty great. Maybe move Turner for a PF that fits better. Could probably get KP and a couple picks from the Mavericks for him, for example."

"uhhh malcolm brogdon is scoring 23 a game. if he can do it, so can damian lillard and devin booker lol some guys are just off to slow starts. dame bricking 3s has nothing to do with foul changes."
Malcolm Brogdon
"Its unknown if Brogdon wanted to stay with the Bucks, and we don't know what other types of offers may have been for him out there. I take Jrue over Brogdon at this point too, and there is no way we could have Giannis Khris Jrue and Malcolm. Christian Wood bounced from a lot of teams, and was known to have attitude problems. Would have been nice to keep him but Bud has a hard on for Ilyasova and we have been trying to make DJ Wilson serviceable. Playing alongside Harden also massively plays to Woods strengths. This is hindsight 20/20 by the  Reddit GMs"
Bucks fans get super defensive about their GM's personnel misses. I've gotten attacked by Bucks fans for saying they should have kept Malcolm Brogdon.
"Maybe I'm a bit too high on Fox in the late 30s, but he's an exciting young talent. I like to give young, exciting players that improve on a year-to-year basis the benefit of the doubt that they can get even better.  Realistically he's probably ""only"" top 50. Gordon Hayward, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic &amp; Co. would probably all be players you would rather have in a play-off series if it took place tomorrow."
