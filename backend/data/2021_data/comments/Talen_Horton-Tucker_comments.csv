"The only thing I'd worry about is hitting the tax apron, that's something that's worrying me as a Lakers since we're gonna need to pay Dennis, Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker this offseason and we already have LeBron, AD, KCP and Kuzma on longer term contracts"
talen horton-tucker our long boi
Talen Horton-Tucker. Has a long ass name so ppl call him THT. He's a really promising 2nd year player for the Lakers
Talen Horton-Tucker
He had that one big game and then has vanished since then. It’s been strange but Talen Horton-Tucker will fill the spot without missing a beat.
Pleasant: Talen Horton-Tucker (albeit in very limited minutes)  Unpleasant: Anthony Davis free throws
Oh yeah lol 300lbs Joel Embiid got flattened by Talen Horton Tucker well played
Who the fuck is Talen Horton-Tucker?
"Talen Horton Tucker was WAAAAY overhyped over preseason games, which was pathetic"
"Most definitely is, Talen Horton Tucker is getting the same treatment now as well but if you don’t frequent this sub I could def see people not knowing who THT is."
That's kind of how Talen Horton-Tucker has been for us.. dude is a beast but sometimes he gets ahead of himself and makes rookie mistakes.
Ain't nobody gonna spell out Talen Horton Tucker.  FUck I just did.
Jarret Allen didn't just fetch Mil's first round pick in 2022. It was Jarret and Taurean Prince for Exum and the pick. Taurean is a bad contract and still has two years remaining; it would have probably taken a late first round pick just to dump his contract.   The trade gives Rockets salary flexibility for summer. They can use the cap space to sign a promising young player in the offseason (similar to Christian Wood). Talen Horton-Tucker could be a good target.
"&gt;Have you actually watched any of the laker games?  Almost every one.  &gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but sounds to me like you're simply going off of stats.   You are wrong.  &gt; THT hasn't really been playing his role or playing within the system.   This is contrary to the [public statements](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/12/22/22195892/lakers-frank-vogel-talen-horton-tucker-scoring-playmaking-skills-lebron-james) of Vogel, and several other Lakers.  &gt;I'd say a lot of his missed baskets are akin to TOs because of his very tunnel visioned play.   They are not.  Even a bad shot might go, and if it doesn't, Harrell -- usually on the court with Horton-Tucker -- is one of the best offensive rebounders in the league ( 3rd best ORB% ).  &gt; he needs to actually earn his playing time on this team.   He has."
Talen Horton Tucker and Alex Caruso are miles better than Grant Willams and Peyton Pritchard
Talen Horton Tucker is getting maxed by the Knicks

"True. Lakers recently have done well too with Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma and Talen-Horton Tucker all taken late"

"Report: Klutch Sports Interested in making Lakers think Knicks, Cavs and Mavericks Interested in Pursuing Talen Horton-Tucker"
"&gt; After being traded to the LA Lakers on draft night, Talen Horton-Tucker signed a fully guaranteed two-year deal with the team worth $2.416 million, which was the best deal the team could offer given the fact they were over the salary cap and out of exceptions.   Found that on https://www.sportscasting.com/why-the-la-lakers-are-unable-to-extend-the-contract-of-talen-horton-tucker/"

Is someone really more likely to recognize Talen Horton Tucker than THT? THT is his more common name honestly.
"Okay let me make sure to type out Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Nickeil Alexander Walker, and Talen Horton Tucker in every comment just for you"
Talen-Horton Tucker  Too long so we use THT
"The point of the original post bringing this up is that they are players people don't recognize though, you're comparing him to one of the most famous  coaches in the nba, whos wiki is DOC rivers, not Glenn rivers, i searched tht trying to figure out who this guy was and got NBA on TNT. His  twitter, wiki, bball ref, all use his real name.  Google talen horton tucker, go to news, NONE of them refer to him as THT."
"Well he has had three draft picks. The #4 draft pick was traded to acquire Anthony Davis. He bought a 2nd to get Talen Horton Tucker, and then he attached Danny Green to the 28th pick this year to acquire Dennis Schroeder"
"It makes sense for Talen Horton Tucker.   Abbreviating to THT makes more sense than those examples.   Shake Milton abbreviated to SM isn't the same.  And Russell Westbrook abbreviated isn't either.  Announcers say ""THT"" all of the time, so do talking heads, journalists and everyone in the basketball world that's talking about him, whereas no one calls Russell Westbrook RW when announcing him, or writing about him. ""Yet here we are"" to two totally different things.   If a player is referred to by an abbreviation all of the time, that's what he's known by. Just look it up. Other than that I do agree if someone is abbreviating dudes like Russ, etc. That never makes sense."
I would normally agree with you but writing talen Horton Tucker everytime is annoying haha. I suppose if you're posting something to r/NBA it makes sense
"Alex ""Average Player"" Caruso and Talen ""Scrub"" Horton-Tucker"
"If you see THT a million times and dont know who he was, would you know who is Talen Horton Tucker if you hear the name instead?   They're just letter reference to a person lol"
Talen Horton-Tucker. He has a hyphenated last name so he gets abbreviated
"When they first introduced him it was Talen Horton-Tucker. After that, its been THT. Its not some fan calling him that, its everybody. THT. Remember that. You are going to hate that name for years."
I’ll help you out.   Talen Horton-Tucker
Talen Horton Tucker
"Talen ""Horton hears a who"" Tucker"
Talen Horton-Tucker. Not common knowledge whatsoever for the average NBA fan. Wasn't there *just* a top post on this sub about not using abbreviated nicknames for every single random player? Yet here we are      Edit: [Can we please stop calling players that 90% of people wouldn't recognize by their initials? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kpaw7d/can_we_please_stop_calling_players_that_90_of)

Also is there anyone named with the initials of THT?   Like people who don’t know who you mean by THT would probably not know him if you said Talen Horton Tucker.
Talen Horton-Tucker
Yup. There's a reason this post is about Malachi Flynn and not Talen Horton Tucker or which ever rookie that popped in preseason. Everyone else was memeing about their rookies or at some semblance of self awareness.
There was one for Talen Horton Tucker yesterday lmao
"Talen Horton-tucker so THT, not sure why i thought it was a D lol"
"I think names like his deserve an exception.  Typing out Talen Horton-Tucker is a bit of a pain in the ass.  That hyphen hits different man.  Also he is a total star, did you miss the preseason or something?"
"Agree with you, it's Talen Horton-Tucker, Lakers draft pick from last year who was killing it in preseason this year"
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."

Talen Horton-Tucker from the Lakers.
"Whenever I see THT, I cringe. I don't know if someone is talking about Tim Hardaway Jr or Talen Horton Tucker.. It is a mouthful and just easier/more fluid to say Tucker."
"Those already started this offseason. I also saw one of those bullshit trade articles on ‘nbadraftanalysis.net’ (thank you Google app) titled “This Hawks-Lakers trade includes an intriguing young wing:  Hawks receive: Kyle Kuzma, Talen Horton Tucker   Lakers receive: Cam Reddish and a 2nd round pick”  Like, fuck no, the hawks aren’t trading their highest upside young wing for kuzma amd THT."
Literally anytime someone refers to talen Horton tucker as THT
"Won't help flight stop calling Talen Horton-Tucker ""THC dude"""
"For me it's Talen Horton-Tucker (THT) on the Lakers, I always think ""Tim Hardaway Tunior?"""
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would easily shoot at least 50/50/90 in the NBA Finals against the Lakers, especially with Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and Talen Horton-Tucker on the team.  As a Kevin Durant fan.... I would much rather face the Lakers than the Clippers in the Finals.  Nets in 4 against the Lakers."
Talen Horton-Tucker
who is malachi flynn   is he like Raptors version of talen horton tucker?
Already a bunch of great names in here but I'll add that for us it's Talen Horton Tucker. He went from being at the bottom of our depth chart to being a reliable scorer off the bench and even starting occasionally for injured guys.   He's actually quite a versatile scorer for how he looks. He's got a body like PJ Tucker but when he gets in the paint he's surprisingly acrobatic and the way he moves with the ball is very similar to how Jimmy Butler disrupts defenses. Not bad for a 2nd round pick.
I WANT TALEN HORTON-TUCKER
"Biased take... Rob Pelinka? Kinda obvious if you think about it.   Lost McGee, Dwight, Rondo, Avery Bradley, and Danny Green.   Gained Trez, Gasol, Schröder, Wesley Matthews  Drafted Talen Horton Tucker who has broken out for us   Recently signed Damian Jones who has been doing really well"

Talen Horton-Tucker sounds to me like the name of a slide guitarist in a southern rock band
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."
I saw people calling Talen-Horton Tucker Geodude and I like that one a lot.  I know he's not technically a rookie but yeah. This is his first real taste of actual playing time.
Talen Horton Tucker
Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker (mostly THT) had taken over his minutes
Talen Horton Tucker at 246?   Bruh. I've got him at 217 on my top 300 list. You're crazy.
"facts they be like:  &gt;""Timberwolves would be fucking stupid to turn down Talen Horton-Tucker and the 60th pick for KAT"""
"&gt; Read the article he literally played games from November to March when the g-league season ends, only taking games out to play for first team.  Jesus christ, man. Your only source of info is lakeshowlife? And you talk about people dunking on me...  The fact was that Talen Horton-Tucker was a 19 year old rookie who came into the season injured, overweight, out of shape, and on a team with championship expectations. So obviously he didn’t play much...  What’s your point?"
"“Most of the season” he played 38 of the 50 games in the g league season + 6 games with the lakers, so maybe you ought to learn to read before telling other people to do “research”   The foot fracture was in the preseason.   https://lakeshowlife.com/2020/10/06/lakers-talen-horton-tucker-season-g-league/  Good god man."
and he's nowhere even close to the level of a star player which Laker fans were convinced that he was lmao. Now they're doing the same for talen horton tucker lmfao
"Yes, but only re: Talen Horton Tucker"
"Unfortunately we only have one year of data for both these guys together, and unfortunately we keep moving the goalposts in this discussion. Danny Green was prioritized above Alex Caruso throughout the regular season and the vast majority of the playoffs - is that statement incorrect?   And two more notes: 1.	The playoffs are much more matchup dependent so of course there’s going to be some variance between series. 2.	The sentiment here was very low on Danny Green’s contract just last year, especially his perception by Lakers fans. If you’re going to argue that Talen Horton Tucker deserves 15M a year, there must be better evidence than Danny Green"
Lowry for Talen Horton Tucker and a pick. Who says no?
"AD had nothing to do with recruiting/scouting THT, he barely even knew who he was. It was LeBron who told Rich Paul.  [Anthony Davis Didn’t Know About Talen Horton-Tucker](https://lakersnation.com/lakers-news-anthony-davis-didnt-know-about-talen-horton-tucker-draft/2021/01/14/)  &gt;Though not for James, who alerted agent Rich Paul after watching Horton-Tucker in high school. Paul has gone on to represent the youngster as well.  &gt;Davis, on the other hand, had barely heard of Horton-Tucker, despite also being from Chicago. “I don’t really follow that much basketball, to be honest, so I heard of him but I didn’t really pay attention or anything like that,” Davis revealed.  &gt;“I’m from Chicago, so I hear about a lot of the kids coming out of Chicago, a lot of names. But I never really watched him play. When the Lakers drafted him and he signed with Klutch, Rich and some other people told me about him, so then I went back and watched highlights and stuff like that. I was like, ‘Oh, we got a steal.’"

"Great fundamentals.  The veer should be taught to extremely young players.  It's a great way to introduce initiating contact and to not be afraid of it.  It's also a great way for the kids who aren't the fastest or quickest to be effective while dribbling.  Luka, and Talen Horton-Tucker are two examples off the top of my head who aren't very fast but use the veer so well they get buckets at the rim all the time."

Is Talen Horton-Tucker better than Micheal Jordan already? Personally my top 10 NBA all time is:  Kareem LeBron  Wilt Magic Kobe Shaq Worthy Pau West Lamar Odom   Honorable mentions: Michael Cooper Jeanie Buss Jack Nicholson
"Honestly we’re probably gonna call one of these games the “talen Horton Tucker” game and he’ll just come alive, and we’ll be like “oh shit”. It’s inevitable with stuff like this."
&gt;Talen Horton Tucker  He was just an example of anyone who is not Michael Jordan.
Not as good as Talen Horton Tucker tho
Yeah bro because Oden definitely projected to be a Talen Horton Tucker level talent...
&gt; This is like saying Talen Horton-Tucker could be a more offensively-skilled Michael Jordan   Lmao ????
"&gt;Greg Oden could’ve been a more offensively skilled Dwight Howard  Oden never had the skill or athleticism of Howard.  This is like saying Talen Horton-Tucker could be a more offensively-skilled Michael Jordan... yeah, if he developed both way more skill and athleticism, sure."

"Both pat and thad are playing lauri's position right now. So he's not exactly needed when the dude that the new front office just drafted 4th overall has taken his spot. Also thad is our second best player lol.  Lauri also gets hurt every year, is inconsistent on offense, can't switch on the perimeter on defense, can't protect the rim either, and also doesn't box out well for rebounds. And just in general a 7ft power forward who can't switch and is a negative defender isn't going to be starting for a contending team so...  I used to like lauri but, we should definitely shop him. He shouldn't be in our long term plans. Especially not as a starter if we plan to be good anytime soon. Also I'll give it like a 1% chance anyone would give up a first round pick for lauri lmao. I don't think lauri's value is that much, even if it is a late first.   He's not worth the  20+ mil he wants. I'd rather have derrick jones jr or talen horton tucker for below 15 or 10 mil than lauri since they'll be much cheaper and can actually defend the perimeter. I doubt theres a lot of bulls fans that still view him as a core piece anymore."

"The Tucker brothers, Talen and Horton"
"Talen Horton-Tucker is 20 years old, which everyone knows.  He also grew up in Chicago.  So he was eleven years old when Derrick Rose won the MVP.  A couple years later, Horton-Tucker followed Rose to Simeon Academy in Chicago.  Imagine what going head-to-head with Rose, and then hitting this shot, meant to him.  That kid isn't going to sleep for days.  When he does, he'll need a new dream."

"[\[The Athletic\] The Lakers were willing to trade away Dennis Schröder and KCP for Kyle Lowry. However, **the sticking point in the trade was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/mdbymq/the_athletic_the_lakers_were_willing_to_trade/)  Lowry, Caruso, Wes Matthews, and Mclemore&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Schroder, Caruso, KCP, Mclemore, THT, and Matthews"
"So true, Talen Horton-Tucker and Marc Gasol are also top 10 in defensive rating and even with some credit to Gasol they are not locking anyone up. Single player defensive ratings is useless when the team has been No.1 in defense all year"
"I think the Lakers would do so well from this:  Skill Boost: Talen Horton Tucker - He's already a super athletic, long armed freak. Give him better shooting splits and vision and he would be an amazing contributor off the bench.   Athleticism Boost: Marc Gasol - Holy hell if this man could slide his feet better he'd be back to DPOY level impact. What a scary sight next to AD  3 Inch Size Boost: Dennis Schroeder - Dennis is already a pest on defense, but if he grew 3 inches he'd be bothering PGs so much more, and would be even more switchable."
"yeah thats why actual reputable sources after the deadline continue to report it   &gt; Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.   &gt; The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers in his second season.   &gt; The Lakers’ willingness to include Schröder and Caldwell-Pope is revealing."

"No, they couldn't afford to lose future superstar Talen Horton Tucker"
Talen “better than Lowry” Horton Tucker
Untouchable trade asset talen Horton Tucker in any Lowry trade will go his whole career without dropping 37
Yes they did not want to give up Talen Horton Tucker
"The “should’ve traded for a 6x all-star championship point guard” statement game.  But hey, at least the Lakers still have future superstar Talen Horton-Tucker."
I think Herro was the only unreasonable ask. Is Schroeder + Talen-Horton Tucker really too much for Lowry?   Trading for him now also means you get his bird rights. None of these contenders have the cap space to sign him to anything more than a mid-level exception this summer (unless Miami doesn’t resign Oladipo).

This is one of the hardest teams to try and reconstruct because they weren’t superstars but they fit really well  Chauncey Billups- Kyle Lowry  Rip Hamilton- Joe Ingles  Tayshaun Prince- Talen Horton-Tucker   Rasheed Wallace- Michael Porter Jr.   Ben Wallace- Clint Capela   The team that I built isn’t as good on defense but is better offensively

He's literally the WORST volume scorer in the league EVER. lmao yes he can't do it on KD's (67 TS%) efficiency even in his dreams, in rec league.

"For the Lakers to get another star of any kind it would first and foremost require that star to demand a trade to the Lakers. The Lakers *could* pull together the assets to offer Chicago something for LaVine, but above all else it would require LaVine doing what AD did and saying he'd only want to be traded to the Lakers, as that would scare away any other team looking to trade for him.   If LaVine says he wants to stay with the Bulls, they won't even bother talking to anyone else about trading him. That's a given. But it is possible he doesn't like the direction the team is going in and tells the Bulls he doesn't plan to re-sign next year (this is actually fairly possible, given their lack of success in his time there), in which case the Bulls would most likely move him this summer rather than just lose him in free agency in 2022. But other teams could definitely outbid the Lakers for LaVine, as long as he'd indicate that he'd be willing to re-sign with them for the max in 2022.   But if LaVine said he wanted to be traded to the Lakers, they could definitely make that happen. For one thing, LaVine's current contract is relatively small, at only $19.5 million, so it would be easy to match salaries. The Lakers could even take on one of the Bulls less appealing contracts to make it work (Aminu maybe?). The Lakers have the 22nd pick in this year's draft they can trade, and they have their unprotected 2027 1st round pick they can offer. They also could probably send a signed and traded Talen Horton-Tucker (a Chicago native), as well as KCP and/or Kuzma if the Bulls had any interest (KCP is 28, Kuzma is 26, both have $13 million contracts). It's also possible Trez will opt in to his contract so they could send him out on an expiring 1 year deal for $10 million, and it's also possible Schroder could be open to going to Chicago.   I feel like if LaVine wanted to force his way to the Lakers, they'd figure out a way to make it work. It's just a question if LaVine even wants that (and of course, there hasn't been any report anywhere that he does)."
Coulda had him but y'all didn't wanna give up Talen Horton Tucker
This happened to Talen Horton Tucker in the Bubble last year. He was 19 when the Lakers won.
"Also forgot to mention NBA Champion Jared Dudley, NBA Champion Kyle Kuzma, and NBA Champion Talen Horton Tucker"
Talen horton tucker crowd?
"&gt;they're akin to Westbrooks stats.  You're going to have to sell that garbage elsewhere.  Westbrook took a bad team to the playoffs with those stats.  The Lakers also would not have made the playoffs without Schroder.  &gt;If you watched schroeder play he CANNOT run an offense without Lebron or AD on the floor, our second squad looks LOST out there  Because Vogel's only offensive ideas are to isolate James or Davis, and watch them do something.  No player is going to thrive playing with Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Marc Gasol, and Talen Horton-Tucker, when all are simply freelancing with no plan.  Even Schroder's most frequent teammate Caldwell-Pope routinely lost his confidence and was generally streaky as usual.  &gt;, if they're paying $84 MM they need a 1 who can create offense through any set of players on the floor,  No such player exists.  Harden couldn't do that.  &gt;Schroeder is not staying in LA.  He might, but he absolutely should."
"I don't agree at all. Drummond is awful, they at a minimum need a rim protector who is capable. Gasol is too old. Kuzma doesn't complement anyone on the team and I would trade him for a 3 point shooter. He also has poor defense. Schroeder is an undersized guard who plays undersized, and his defense isn't as great as people claim it is. Montrez doesn't have good defense and is overpaid for what he brings to the team. Matthews is just bad.  The only players who are worth anything, besides James and Davis, are KCP, Caruso, and Talen Horton Tucker. Maybe also Montrez. But everyone else needs to go and they need 3s, defense, and a point guard."

2nd quarter:  Talen Horton-Tucker: 4 points Rest of LAL: 2 points
Talen Horton Tucker definitely still thinks he is the player that /r/Lakers thought he was in February
"Ben Mcclemore, Wesley Matthews, Markief Morris, Talen Horton Tucker. Who the fuck put this roster together"
That's the most he *could* get. I'm not saying he's going to get it. But there have been reports that teams might want to offer him that much this year ([example](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/02/08/lakers-talen-horton-tucker-could-get-poison-pill-offer-sheet-in-free-agency/amp/)). My point is he could be used as additional salary to make a trade work.
"A star player would have to be available via trade for this to even be possible, of course. But if we're going with the hypothetical situation that one such player is available, then the Lakers could package some combination of their 1st round pick this year, their unprotected 1st from 2027 or 28, KCP ($13 million), Kuzma ($13 million), and a signed and traded Schroder, Harrell and/or Talen Horton Tucker. To me the biggest stumbling block isn't whether the Lakers have the pieces to pull it off, it's whether a star player is actually going to be available."
"They actually have a fair amount of flexibility. They have their own 1st round pick this year to trade, as well as a future 1st (either 2027 or 2028 if they want to). On top of that they have KCP's $13 million contract, Kuzma's $13 million contract as well as Marc Gasol's $2.7 million contract and Alfonso McKinnie's $1.9 million contract. In addition they may be able to sign and trade Dennis Schroder, Montrezl Harrell (they could sign him to a 1+1 for $23 million along with early Bird rights), or Talen Horton-Tucker (he could get as much as 4 years and about $83 million).   That's a lot of possible pieces to make salary combinations with if players become available via trade."
"Dennis, KCP, THT, and picks.  &gt;Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker."
Makes sense when you replace the best player in the world with Talen Horton-Tucker
Weird swipe. I don't think about that at all -  I think that most of us were happy to see him stay in Toronto. I do think it's ridiculous that the Lakers apparently wouldn't give up Talen Horton-Tucker.
"I do something similar with Talen Horton Tucker, I read THT as ""Tim Hardaway Tunior"" lmfao"
Players the Los Angeles Lakers have fairly obtained:  AD (Traded assets)  Schroder (Trade)  Kuzma (Draft)  Caruso (Draft)  Talen Horton Tucker (Draft)
"If Talen Horton played in Toronto, do you think they would call him Tim Horton Tucker?"
"Talen *""Kobe Bryant""* Horton-Tucker"
Says the fan base that says THT to refer to Talen Horton Tucker lmao
"Nah, when I tried to connect 40s player Ed Sadowski to Talen Horton Tucker it BSed me. Said ""Willie Jones"" was on both the 63' Pistons and the 83' Clippers. Turns out, it was not the same person."
"Allen's ceiling seems to be Clint Capela and he's not there quite yet so his statement is harsh but accurate. However, in terms of predicting which players will be stars in the future I can think of a handful of other fanbases who are worse. For starters, I'd like to know your original thoughts about Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram and your current thoughts on Talen Horton-Tucker."
"&gt;League executives also mentioned Bruce Brown, Alex Caruso, Talen Horton-Tucker and Nerlens Noel as players who could be in for significant raises averaging above $12 million per season.  Shit! I am afraid to see what Tim Hardaway is going these guys are getting above $12 million."
"Oh, yeah, that is a good point about the cap holds.  Although maybe just let Hart walk then and keep Ball and I think team could have some space if it could trade Adams without taking back money (which is obviously a huge if).  Yeah, actually getting someone good in FA could be tough. DeVonte Graham might be moving in FA.  Malik Monk.  Duncan Robinson.  Talen Horton-Tucker.  Dennis Schroder.  Some slim pickings."

However the Lakers not willing to trade Talen Horton Tucker, and the 76ers being super hot on Maxey, Thybulle, Salary filler and a late 1st was bad.

Talen Horton-Tucker has a championship ring. Talen Horton-Tucker is not better than Charles Barkley.
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"

"It’s in the linked article in the original post:   &gt;	Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, **the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker**.  &gt;	The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that **he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker**, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers in his second season.  You’re right it’s all rumors but the rumors were the Lakers didn’t want to include THT."

"Thank you so much. I work overnights and needed that hearty laugh in the middle of my shift.   “The Jazz could use someone like SM!”  That got me rolling. Shake Milton.   I know some are more insider, like Lakers fans call Talen Horton-Tucker, THT. I get that, because who wants to even start with a hyphenated name, but has he earned that? Not many Charlotte fans are going to recognize what the hell a THT is.   Some guys have really cool acronyms, so I also get the AK47s of the world. Andrei Kirilenko was better still, though, than SM and THT."

"Lol, Talen Horton-Tucker"
Talen Horton Tucker. Show when he got minutes he is capable. Almost caused an upset against maybe Boston down by double digits
"Talen Horton-Tucker. I know people talked about him during the pre-season last year, but if he develops a reliable jump shot and can get rid of tunnel vision on drives, he’s got all the tools."
Talen Horton-Tucker   Ik he already gets a lot of hype but I just think his potential is limitless
Talen Horton Tucker
Most people don't want to take the time to actually write out Talen Horton-Tucker lmao
"How is Jonas Valanciunas not on here?   Talen Horton-Tucker is nice, too."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
your the one saying lonzo is the center piece of a team with 3 all stars.    Talen Horton tucker is Kendal marshall.  Look at these select games where I put up big numbers on bench players oooh.  Oh where Have I seen this before?  Zubac only got those minutes because boogie cant play minutes and Ibaka was out.  Thomas Bryant is on the fucking wizards averaging 11 points a game. What the hell is your level of greatness? sheesh lol
"ingram, yes, randle yes... the rest hell no, you dont get props for serviceable... add talen horton tucker to that overhype list too."
"Because he's on the Lakers, and pretending to know shit about the Lakers is every casual NBA fan's favorite pastime.    Imagine having the whole sub confidently talking about about the 7-10 guys on, say, the Magic. Ridiculous. Yet somehow everyone and their mother has passionate and super-well-informed opinions on Talen Horton Tucker? Lol fuck outta here."
"6'6"" with a 7'2"" wingspan apparently was a good passer at Baylor. Played football and had 2 TD's. Kind of looks like Talen Horton-Tucker IMO. Low risk maybe surprises fans down for this."
"&gt;SG- Wayne Ellington, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker  that's definitely an all time great list of shooting guards"
"Guard Talen Horton-Tucker yelled out, “We got an [expletive] congregation now.”"

"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here.

"Dw you'll get to enjoy Dennis ""That's Tuff 🔥💯"" Schroder instead because also in that article:  &gt; The Knicks are mentioned by league sources as a team that has expressed interest in Fournier, while New York has also been linked to Lakers guards Dennis Schroder and Talen Horton-Tucker."
Happens literally all the time. People need to stop being fooled. Talen Horton Tucker is the next big bust that Lakers fans and their dumbass media will try to hype up
"The money being committed to those three players doesn't matter though, the Lakers were going to be over the cap anyway, adding Westbrook didn't change that. They'll have to fill up their roster, of course, but they already should be the favorites to re-sign Wes Matthews, Markieff Morris, Alex Caruso, and Talen Horton-Tucker. They will probably get something for Dennis Schroder in a sign and trade, and then after that they'll have the MLE and vet minimums to use for the remaining 3-5 roster spots."
Like Talen Horton-Tucker I suppose?? Though that's the only Talen I can think of
"To be fair the Lakers team has scouted well in the 2nd round. Svi, Thomas Bryant, Bonga, Zubac, Talen Horton Tucker."
"We need to keep in mind that because of Kuzma's poison pill status this trade can't be executed until August 6. On top of that, the Lakers and everyone else are prohibited from even talking to Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker until free agency opens (see the Bucks-Kings disaster from last year). Given all that I think it's a good bet that this is not the final form of this trade (we already saw Washington move that pick, that will probably just be included in this trade). We could see Buddy Hield still get traded to the Lakers with any of those free agents the Lakers have being signed and traded elsewhere, or we could see something else. We shouldn't be thinking about it like this deal is done and now what are they going to do. Westbrook is gonna be on the Lakers, but the other stuff could very much still be in flux."
"Wes Matthews and Markieff Morris will probably be back as well, along with Talen Horton-Tucker."
"I want to point out what the absolute max the Lakers can pay some of these guys would be:  * Wes Matthews - $4,347,600 (using non Bird rights)  * Markieff Morris - $10 million (using early Bird rights)  * Andre Drummond - $5.9 million (using MLE)  * Ben McLemore - vet minimum  * Dennis Schroder - 5 year max starting at 30% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Alex Caruso - 5 year max starting at 25% of the cap using full Bird rights  * Talen Horton-Tucker - full MLE (Arenas limited restricted free agent using early Bird rights)  These guys won't all get the max the Lakers can pay them, of course, but this is how they can fill out the rest of their roster even if they have LeBron, AD and Westbrook."
"More importantly, give me Talen Horton-Tucker. Fuck all these 27 yr olds Lakers don't want.   We literally have 0 playable guards on the roster rn other than Beal."
"This is still dumb. It's not about ""being desperate"" to get something for Lowry, it's just common sense that something good is better than nothing. It's obvious that the Raptors would like to get something in return for Lowry rather than just have him walk. Do you really need to have this explained to you this many times?  As for the Lakers disussing Kuzma in trade talks, you're again not reading that correctly if you think the Lakers are frantically trying to dump him on anyone they can. They are looking to upgrade their roster using the only players they have under contract that they're allowed to talk about trading are Kuzma and KCP. They haven't been traded yet because these are just early discussions. The Lakers likely will have other pieces to offer once Trez officially opts in and they're no longer prohibited from talking to their upcoming free agents in Schroder, Talen Horton-Tucker and Caruso. That's why no trades have been made, not because there's no interest. It's why we're all just left speculating for now rather than talking about a bunch of actual trades. Get it?"

A lot more than shit podcasts are reporting on it. I know it’s hard to believe lol
"Honestly this is probably the most success Iowa State players have had in the league ever. Monte Morris- one of the best 6th men in the league Tyrese Haliburton- ROY candidate this year, seems to be a key piece for the Kings moving forward  Georges Niang, Abdel Nader, Talen Horton-Tucker- All solid rotation players for playoff teams Plus you have guys like Matt Thomas, Naz Long, Deonte Burton, and Marial Shayok who have all had appearances on rosters for playoff teams.  Ironically, Royce White was one of the highest draft picks and he flamed out, although that obviously wasn't for on-court reasons."
"Odds are if the Lakers are going to get either one of them it would be through a sign and trade, rather than via cap exceptions. Doing any S&amp;T would hard cap the Lakers, but if they're willing to do that again (they were last year), then it's really not unrealistic to think they could get both players via S&amp;T. Realistically what would it take to get either player via S&amp;T? I don't think either one would be that daunting to pull off.   Reports are that Montrezl Harrell is probably going to opt in, which would give the Lakers his $10 million contract, Kuzma's $13 million contract and KCP's $13 million contract as salary ballast/assets in trades. They also have Marc Gasol's $2 million and Alfonzo McKinnie's $2 million to throw in to help. Then they could S&amp;T Talen Horton-Tucker or Dennis Schroder, and they have the 22nd pick along with their 2027 1st rounder they could trade. There's enough there to execute a pair of S&amp;Ts."

"Yes. It would be harder but I was told no team could move Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook with those contracts and it happened. Twice for CP3. Some team will take on your bad salary if you throw in some other pieces or picks. If they want Westbrook, they can make those salaries almost match and give Washington Kuzma and a ton of picks to get it done. They're not getting CP3 or Westbrook without sending a nice chuck of salary in the trade.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-mulling-russell-westbrook-trade-for-kyle-kuzma-dennis-schroder-and-talen-horton-tucker-per-report/"

"No, those guys would obviously be off the table. But if you're the Suns and you have worries about going all in with 36 year old Chris Paul going forward when the rest of your team is so young, then it's possible they might want to move him now while his value is high. Could they get a legit young star for him? I doubt it, given his age. But like, could they get Ben Simmons or CJ McCollum for him? My guess is no, but maybe I'm wrong.   So if you want to cash in on him now and you can't get a star, then getting a group of young role players and picks is probably the way to go. Maybe the Lakers could throw in Kuzma and the 22nd pick in the draft and then also explore sign and trade deals for Talen Horton-Tucker or Dennis Schroder, with them going to other teams and pieces going back to the Suns in return in a 3-way deal.  Like I said, I think the odds are overwhelmingly that the Suns just re-sign CP3, so this is probably just a moot exercise. But if the Suns did want to go in a different direction or if CP3 really wanted to go to the Lakers, there's always ways to make that stuff happen."
"""Talen Horton-Tucker Eyes"""
give me talen horton-tucker over both.  6’4 versatile guard with a 7’1 wingspan who’s only 20 years old.. guys like that are once in a generation
Preparing to be cyber bullied again for mentioning Talen Horton-Tucker but he was like 240lbs as a guard out of college. He trimmed the fat and got way better during the pandemic break.
"He’s just another role player. He’s not bad. But teams tend to over react to their bench talent.   Talen Horton-Tucker really is just a regular bench guy, same way Alex Caruso is, same way that Poole is. They’re not bad players and they’re not busts or anything. But they’re literally 12-15 minute a game guys and nothing more.   It’s okay to like role players but we don’t have to hype them up as way more than they really are.   Food for thought: Poole played last year. He’s probably not better than Klay Thompson and Moses Moody so I don’t know how many minutes he even gets this year on a WINNING warriors team.  Any role player can score 12 a night on a losing team"
Talen Horton Tucker
Talen Horton Tucker
Talen Horton Tucker would be a top 5 pick in a re draft.
No it’s an abbreviation of Talen Horton-Tucker
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"Yeap, Mac McClung and Talen Horton-Tucker"
"If there was an expansion draft before this season, I think Malik Monk or Talen Horton Tucker. The Lakers are in win-now mode so probably can't afford to protect either, but I think both would do well on a team where they had the chance to have a big role (Talen Horton Tucker more so but I think he's likely to get protected first)"
8.Talen Horton-Tucker hell nah
"Talen Horton Tucker, Jaden McDaniels, or Jaren Jackson Jr."
Talen Horton Tucker is the most overrated terrible player I’ve ever seen
This from the fan base praising superstars Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker lmfaoooo
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
"&gt; If he wasn't a Laker, nobody would know who he is   And if he wasn’t on the lakers he’d be touted as an upcoming underrated player that everyone is sleeping on  Russell  Nance   Clarkson   Ingram   Lonzo   Randle  Etc…  All went from trash and overhyped to underrated and likeable on new teams   It would be no different with Talen Horton Tucker"
Talen Horton-Tucker is still like 12 years old or something.
Coby White for Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn (two Chicago boys). Who says no?
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
"Talen Horton Tucker, Rondo, Dwight were on the championship team."
Best i can do is talen horton tucker
"Talen Horton Tucker. Or according to this sub, the most overrated young player."
"Talen Horton Tucker  A lot of laker fans think THT is gonna be an all star just off potential. They’re post in the Lakers sub saying he’s special, Imo every young player has all star potential but most of them won’t be an all star  I don’t see what makes THT a future all star, he has a long wing span but hasn’t shown to use that to his advantage, and he can finish around the rim but he often makes dumb plays and dumb turn overs to the point where I rather him not touch the ball  I wish THT would become an all star, it would only help my team win another championship but I don’t see the hype over him and I don’t see what makes him an all star"
Talen Horton-Tucker
"A year ago, it would have been Simmons, but people have wizened up by now.    These days, it's hard to tell.  People seem cautious/critical of young guys.    I guess maybe Tyler Herro? But things have cooled off since their finals win.    One might say Talen Horton-Tucker, but I think everybody outside of LA knows that he's just getting the typical LA-hype.    People might say Anthony Edwards, but people haven't been overhyped about him.    Ja has proven he isn't just hype.    Booker to.    Ayton as well.    It's hard to find a young guy that gets hyped these days that doesn't get an equal amount of criticism.    If anything, people seem to be extremely harsh of young guys these days. If 19 year olds don't play like All-Stars by their second season, people act like they are a bust.    So this is a hard question."
This is the kind of thread that in like 4 years some guy is gonna link and say “Look at all these morons who thought reigning MVP Talen Horton-Tucker was bad”

Talen Horton Tucker
"If rich Paul truly were screwing over his players, his stream of clients would have ended a long time ago. After all, the nba circle is extremely small.  It may have been a case of him taking on too much responsibility, as after the issue with Noel, he entered a partnership with UTA, and now smaller Klutch guys like talen Horton tucker have their own agents working for them within klutch.  And mino had conflict of interest dealings with his own clients too. He infamously negotiated a 27m payment for himself during the pogba transfer that not even pogba knew about."
Talen Horton-Tucker can’t keep getting away with this
Talen Horton Tucker
Talen Horton-Tucker
Bazemore isn't ancient at only 32 and Malik Monk and Talen Horton-Tucker of course are very young.
"Who were probably the biggest unrestricted free agents this summer? You had guys like Kawhi, Conley, and Chris Paul who just re-signed with their teams (and that could happen with LaVine, of course). But what about guys like Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan? They were unrestricted but ended up getting signed and traded elsewhere. So the same could happen with big unrestricted free agents next summer as well, right?  So of course, the big question is ""why would the Bulls sign and trade LaVine next summer?"" Well first he'd have to make them believe he's going to leave no matter what. He could do that by threatening to go to Orlando, San Antonio or Detroit. That's probably how Kyle Lowry got Toronto to send him to Miami: by making them think if they didn't then he'd go sign with New Orleans and they'd get nothing in return. At least now they have Precious and Dragic, right?  So if LaVine wanted to go to say, the Lakers (this is Klutch, after all), all he'd have to do is convince the Bulls that they're going to lose him either way, and then they'll feel like they'd be better off getting something for him rather than nothing. So then all the Lakers would have to do to offer him a 4 year max at $154 million in a sign and trade is send back matching salary for that first year at $35.7 million. If only the Lakers had a big expiring contract they could send... Oh yeah, Westbrook will only have one year left on his contract next summer, they could send him! They also could send Chicago native Talen Horton-Tucker or their first round pick in 2027, 2028 or 2029 if needed.   So there you go. If you're a conspiracy theorist and you're wondering why LaVine might sign with Klutch, well it could be for the same reason Anthony Davis did. Or maybe he plans to just re-sign with the Bulls and wants Rich Paul to represent him. We'll have to wait and see."
"Let’s keep going down the line Jordan Clarkson, Trey Lyles, Eric Bledsoe, Darius Garland, Talen Horton Tucker, Dion Waiters…a homeless person could have done those right?"

"Sure. But when every other guy not named Talen Horton Tucker is a seasoned vet, there is less need for Dudley on the roster."
Talen Horton-Tucker is 20 years old. He's their youngest signed player.
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."

"I think the challenge is that the drama stuff is way more universal and easier to talk about than game content. As a Thunder fan, I want to read and discuss game content about Thunder games and players but haven't watched enough of Talen Horton-Tucker to be able to discuss his play. As a Lakers fan, you probably want to read and discuss game content about the Lakers but probably don't have much to say about Darius Bazely.  However, when Kyrie Irving says the earth is flat, that's an easy discussion point to all of us because everyone on this forum knows who Kyrie is and is generally familiar with accepted cosmology. There's no barrier to entry to discussion.  We'd all love to *read* other people's analysis of how the Kings' defensive schemes don't properly utilize the talents of Tyrese Haliburton or whatever, but this content takes a significant amount of effort (research, film study, analytics code/spreadsheets, visualizations, etc) to *produce*. Any OC on this forum with the slightest modicum of effort and insight is instantly upvoted to the top, but you can't upvote what isn't there. I tried to write up a film study thing for /r/cfb earlier this season, but my god it takes *so. much. time* to produce something worthwhile.  Commenting ""lmao I bet Jimmy Butler and Rachel Nichols hooked up"" or ""lmao MPJ finally found a shot he won't take"" takes 3 seconds."

"Joining other euro legends Monte Morris, Matt Thomas and Talen Horton Tucker"
Talen Horton Tucker. Time to see if paying him over Caruso was worth it
Jordan Poole and Talen Horton-Tucker will still play in the same time zones after those two retire.
It wouldn't have mattered last year as LeBron never got healthy again and AD got hurt in the playoffs. The Lakers didn't want to give up Talen Horton-Tucker (who isn't yet old enough to drink) for 35 year old Lowry. As a Laker fan I still support that move.

"They tanked and got Alex Caruso? Kyle Kuzma? Talen Horton Tucker? Jordan Clarkson?  Just trying to figure out how those 4 players in particular fit into your bs narrative.   It’s also funny how one comment says you can’t count top picks, if they bust or not, because it’s consensus, and you say you can’t count them because they “tanked”.   Your insecurity is showing."
"Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker, and Kendrick Nunn really bout to go through it this season lmfao"
I'm guessing that he and Talen Horton-Tucker probably have roughly the same standing reach despite Bates being 5 inches taller than THT.
"They couldn't have paid both and not be in the tax, so they had to choose one.  THT being younger and having a higher ceiling played a factor, but I think him being Klutch and not getting any outside offers forced LeBron's hand.  FWIW Caruso has more years but is being paid less than THT.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/chicago-bulls/alex-caruso-21076/  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/talen-horton-tucker-31605/  This is the Klutch Tax at work"
"Dude it’s the opposite. Being on the lakers is what makes them overrated. Kuzma has been talked about more than say Darius Garland the last couple of years even though Garland has star potential. People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   With Kuzma specifically once the Lakers got AD, he became so hyper criticized and got so much shit, everyone now acts like he’s garbage. He received too much attention in both directions because of the Lakers.  The exact same thing will likely happen with Talen Horton Tucker. He is currently in the super overrated stage. Here’s a Twitter account with a million followers saying “hot take that isn’t that hot THT will be a superstar one day.” He also is put in the top 10 in bleacher report’s 2019 re-draft ahead of guys who have shown way more like PJ Washington, Cameron Johnson, and Keldon Johnson.  [tht superstar lol ](https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1440349497096224776?s=21)  [2019 redraft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2948039-2019-nba-re-draft-who-follows-zion-williamson.amp.html)  For fuck’s sake the guy averaged 9 points on bad efficiency. and I’m sure 2-3 years from now when Talen Horton Tucker is a decent back-up guard after being blamed for why the Lakers failed, he will become underrated."
Eric Bledsoe  Donovan Mitchell Anthony Davis Jusuf Nurcic Talen Horton-Tucker  Mitchell and Davis get it done.  THT is underrated.  Bledsoe and Nurcic are gravy.
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."

"My son had the chance to be a ball boy at a Lakers preseason game this year. During a scuffle Lebron lost one of his shoes. When my son tried to return it, Lebron threw a sewing kit in his direction and began singing “High Ho, High Ho, it’s off to work we go” while Talen Horton-Tucker and Rajon Rondo conga line danced my son towards the exit. Last I saw him he was bordered on the Lakers jet on the first flight out to China. When I protested to Lebron, he simply stated “I believe you aren’t educated on the situation and Chinese child labor laws.” I miss my boy dearly."
Alex Caruso didn't have his contract matched so that the Lakers could make room for Talen Horton-Tucker. You love to see it

"It’s really hard to fix this situation, because all but five of their players are on minimum contracts which makes salary matching difficult. LeBron and AD are extremely unlikely to get traded, and Nunn (MLE) has a long-term injury. Russ is on such a big contract that few teams will be interested in getting him. That leaves Talen Horton Tucker as the only player they could easily trade, but they really value his energy, defense &amp; potential and need depth at his position. Not sure what 10mill a year forward they could get to replace him that would make a huge difference. They barely even have picks to package him with, just one 1st in like 2025 and a few 2nds."

"Again, take it with a grain of salt like most trade rumours because we’re not actually there. But according to the reports the opposite of what you’re saying is true.  “Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.  The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers”  They were fine with letting KCP and Dennis go. THT is the one they were intent on holding on to."
literally just in terms of playstyle and its not like harden was what he is now when he was 20 lol. i was very obviously not saying talen horton-tucker is a top 5 player in the league :/
It definitely wasn’t made up out of thin air. It was [well reported](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) that the Lakers didn’t want to include him in a trade. Like most trade rumours you take it with a grain of salt but to say the fans just made it up isn’t true.
"[Lakers were looking at Lowry at last years trade deadline and we’re in serious talks.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) per reports they were looking at making this trade:  &gt; Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker. The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers in his second season  This off season Lowry was a free agent and could sign anywhere with cap space or be S&amp;T. If Lowry wanted to go to the Lakers, the Lakers could have put a package together since teams that have the bird rights FA (Toronto) do not have an insane amount of leverage. Toronto got Dragic from the Heat who isn’t really playing for the Raps right now. Lakers were able to put a package together for Westbrook where they had to off load both Caruso and KCP. If Lakers were reported by Shamas as serious suitors you know they at least had a chat with Lowrys agent and Bobby Webster"
"Could have keep KCP, get Buddy Hield and re-sign Caruso, maybe even trade Talen Horton Tucker for something but nah"
Lakers drafted Talen Horton Tucker who is on the roster sooooooooooooooooooooooooo.............................
"Which invalidated your entire post, as the Lakers still have Talen Horton-Tucker."
"Isn’t it just a pick swap and a first at this point? Also “aging Lakers” is dumb. Everyone in the league ages.   Your remaining Laker picks are tied to a Lakers “team” that is Anthony Davis, Talen Horton Tucker, and $90 million in cap space.   Taking advantage of a pick swap seems unlikely.   Not trying to be hostile."
[Potential trade back in March at the deadline](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) that the Lakers refused because they wanted to keep THT
"Ehh... Choosing a raw kid who MIGHT be good in the future over win-now players like Lowry and Caruso screams LeGM?  What exactly WOULDNT scream LeGM to you then?  Lol this is pretty much the complete opposite of a LeGM move when you refuse to include Talen Horton-Tucker of all people into a trade for another allstar.  LeGM definitely throws THT into that trade without a second thought!   Kidding,  LeBron is definitely known for keeping young players around over an extra star or win-now vets.    Maybe we should get Cavaliers legend Andrew Wiggins throughts on the matter though"
During the reading of this post i was just thinking who is Talen Horton-Tucker? He mostly only played last year and he is injured so he might save the Lakers once he returns.
"The Lakers look like this because they have so many people out right now. I feel like most people forget that Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza are actually part of this team, because they all got hurt in training camp and haven't yet played, but those three will all be major parts of the rotation once they're healthy. They'll be replacing many of the guys who were playing tonight. When you then add AD and LeBron to those guys on the sidelines, the Lakers roster tonight was Westbrook and everyone else is on a vet minimum. Guys who normally won't play at all were getting a lot of minutes tonight.   While all those guys are out injured, people should expect the Lakers to be this bad. They will still be bad even if AD comes back next game. I don't think there's any team in the league who can handle both their best player being out *and* a significant portion of their regular rotation being out. They either need THT and Nunn to come back or LeBron to come back, and until one of those things happens, I fully expect the Lakers to just be really bad. Those three all should be back in a couple weeks though, but the Lakers just need to try to weather the storm as best they can till that happens."
"It's not just LeBron and AD who are out though. The Lakers are also missing their other non-minimum players in Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn, along with Trevor Ariza. People might think those guys aren't great, but without them Melo was the only forward available tonight and Rondo was the only non-Westbrook ball handler for the Lakers. The Lakers desperately need their depth to get healthy along with their stars. With all the guys that are out right now, it really shouldn't be surprising that they're this bad."
"To be fair to the Lakers, Avery Bradley and DeAndre Jordan might very well be out of the rotation entirely when the Lakers get all their injured players back. Bradley was grabbed as a stop gap to tide the Lakers over until Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn are healthy (Bradley's contract isn't guaranteed, so he can just be released if needed). And the Lakers have said they want to play AD more at center, but currently the only forward they had available tonight was Melo, so they kinda have to play Jordan and Dwight.   If you look at the guys the Lakers have who can play forward it's LeBron, AD, Melo, Ariza and THT, and tonight only Melo was available. If you look at who the Lakers have who can handle the ball it's LeBron, Westbrook, Nunn, THT and Rondo, and only Russ and Rondo were available. But they're pretty well set with  bench level shooting guards and centers, so there's that. The Lakers are absolutely decimated in really specific ways and are just scrambling to field even remotely workable lineups. They're gonna be bad until they get some of these players back healthy, there's really no way around that."
"You need to look at who else is out hurt right now, as this is not even close to the Lakers full roster that's playing. Tonight other than Westbrook, every other player who played is on a vet min (except for the 7 minutes AD played with stomach flu). Out of the guys who played, two were two-way players, one is an undrafted rookie, two have non-guaranteed deals, and two were signed to the minimum after being bought out.   The Lakers are scraping the bottom of the barrel right now looking for anyone who can play because 5 of their 7-8 best players are out. So it's not just that the Lakers are missing LeBron and AD, they're also missing Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. There's not many teams that can survive without their best player or two *and* a big chunk of their core rotation. It shouldn't be surprising at all that the Lakers are this bad right now, given all their absences."
"I honestly don't know how anyone can say that for sure yet considering how much of it hasn't even played yet this year. The guys that were playing tonight, sure, that roster is bad, but most of those guys won't be getting minutes once the Lakers are healthy again.   There are 240 available minutes in an NBA game for each team, and right now the Lakers are missing 35 from LeBron, 35 from AD, 25 from Talen Horton-Tucker, 25 from Kendrick Nunn and 20 from Trevor Ariza. That's 140 of 240 total minutes which are out right now (or rather, they got 7 total from those guys tonight because that's all AD played). That's a lot of minutes going to two-way players, undrafted rookies, guys on non-guaranteed contracts, and people on the vet min instead.   So yeah, this lineup we saw tonight that was surrounding Westbrook was definitely bad. No doubt about it. But this isn't the roster the Lakers put in place this summer. This is just all that's left because everyone else is hurt."
"The Lakers definitely don't look good right now, but they have a ton of their core rotation out and have for the entire season. They need to get LeBron and AD back, of course, but they also need Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza to get healthy and finally suit up (none of them have played yet). As a Laker fan I can tell you that the losses or even the way they're playing doesn't bother me, it's the fact that we haven't seen even a close facsimile of what the team will look like once those guys are finally healthy. It's just sucked that they've missed 4-5 core rotation players for literally every game this season."
"Bradley was only picked up because Kendrick Nunn and Talen Horton-Tucker got injured in training camp (along with Trevor Ariza), and because his minimum contract is not guaranteed, so they can release him once the other guys are healthy (if they want to). And I imagine that Jordan will probably fall out of the rotation once the Lakers have Ariza and THT to play forward minutes (in addition to LeBron and Melo, of course), so the Lakers can slide AD back over to center most of the time.   The Lakers are just playing a ton of 9th-15th men on the roster right now because so much of the top 8 are all hurt. That team tonight was Westbrook and all guys on vet minimums. Nobody should expect a roster like that to be any good."
"I don't think the Lakers will cut him, but he very possibly could simply be out of the rotation once LeBron, AD, Ariza and Talen Horton-Tucker are available."
"If someone in the off-season had said ""let me put together a lineup made up exclusively of players on vet minimum contracts and Russell Westbrook"" how good would anyone have expected that team to be? Because other than the 7 minutes AD played tonight, that's exactly what the lineup was.   The Lakers have five players who are making more than the minimum this year, and four of them combined to play 7 minutes tonight. The other one was Russell Westbrook. Everyone else is hurt or had a stomach flu. The Lakers are absolutely decimated by injuries right now, but for whatever reason nobody seems to be aware of it or willing to acknowledge it.   Tonight both of the Lakers two-way players played. They also played their undrafted rookie, Austin Reaves (who only has $100k of his salary guaranteed) 25 minutes tonight. They started a guy on a non-guaranteed minimum contract (Avery Bradley), a guy they claimed off waivers the day before the season started, and he played 23 minutes. Their starting center was salary dumped and bought out this summer, as was their backup point guard (Jordan and Rondo).  They combined to play 33 minutes tonight. Everyone else who played was signed for the vet minimum this summer.   This is not even close to what the Lakers rotation will look like when they are fully healthy, but right now they are missing LeBron, AD, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Ariza will probably only play about 15-20 mpg, but the other guys will probably play 25-40 mpg, and they were all out tonight. If people want to know what is going on with the Lakers, it's quite simple: it's injuries and illness."
"Let's say LeBron is done when his current contract is up (I think that's a long way from certain, but let's just say so for the sake of argument). If that happens then LeBron and Westbrook will both come off the books together after next season, and with only AD and Talen Horton-Tucker on the roster the Lakers will have $70 million in cap space. The Lakers with that kind of space to lure free agents to play next to a 30 year old AD is probably going to be very appealing for free agents. LeBron's window might be closing but that doesn't mean the Lakers' window is.  As for why LeBron would want Westbrook, I think it's mainly that he just wanted someone else to carry a lot of the ball handling and playmaking load so he doesn't have to. LeBron will be the focus in crunch time and in the playoffs, but for most of the regular season I think he loves having someone else to do a lot of the stuff he used to be relied on to run the offense. Westbrook is flawed, but he was available. It's not like they could have got Dame or CP3 instead."
"What will really help the Lakers is if (when) they get Kendrick Nunn and Talen Horton-Tucker back. LeBron too, of course, but it's just brutal for the Lakers to be missing their other two non-Rondo or Westbrook ball handlers when LeBron gets hurt. They also desperately need Ariza to get healthy, but he'll probably be out another month or more. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the only wing the Lakers have left right now is Melo. The Lakers are just really hurting with all these injuries right now. We haven't yet seen at all a close facsimile of what this team is supposed to look like yet, not even in preseason."
"The thing most people are missing is that much of what they replaced those guys with has yet to play a minute this season. The Lakers have yet to see even one second of play from Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn or Trevor Ariza this season, and two of those guys are likely starters with the third being the 6th or 7th man. They replaced KCP, Kuzma and Caruso largely with those guys and Melo and Westbrook, and since most of them haven't yet played, it's not surprising it looks like the Lakers are missing out."
Yes Kendrick Nunn &amp; Talen Horton Tucker are so old
Tatum for future superstar talen horton tucker. Who says no?
As a proud card carrying member of the Talen Horton Tucker future goat candidate bandwagon I will hop on this one too
"Also, the main nuance people are missing in all this piling on with the Lakers is that a huge portion of their lineup is out injured, and has been all year. Maybe that's just people willingly ignoring that fact because it's fun to pile on the Lakers, or maybe they're not even aware of it, I don't know. But the last two games the Lakers have had half their rotation out injured, which obviously puts a huge burden on the guys who are still there, which isn't ideal in a back to back on the road following an overtime game for an older team.   Someone like Melo playing 31 minutes on the second night of a b2b on the road at 37 years of age is definitely not what the Lakers were envisioning this year, but they've been forced into stuff like that (and playing Westbrook and Rondo together, or big minutes for Avery Bradley or unsigned rookie Austin Reaves, etc) simply because they're so thin on bodies right now. Missing LeBron obviously has an impact, but so does missing Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the Lakers only have one wing who's playing (Melo).   It's just a lot for a team that right now is exclusively minimum players outside of AD and Russ. And of course they're also trying to figure out playing together as they don't have any experience doing that. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Lakers are off to a rough start."
"I wouldn't even call it a minority. Most NBA fans are going to watch their team and national games. I can't fault them for that because I'm the same way. My friends swore up and down Talen Horton Tucker was a hot commodity prospect that they were super high on, but they were low on RJ. I asked why, and it really just came down to the fact he was in front of them more and had made some plays that stuck with them. When we compared their body of work it became clear any positive projection you have about him you should have that and more for RJ. But the national conversation does not reflect that for whatever reason."
Just remember that the next time someone talks about how much potential Talen Horton-Tucker has.
"[THT was an RFA, yet there were 0 news about teams giving him an offer sheet.](https://lakersnation.com/lakers-news-restricted-free-agent-talen-horton-tucker-officially-re-signs/2021/08/06/)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;As a restricted free agent, Horton-Tucker could have signed an offer sheet with another team, which the Lakers would have had the ability to match if they wanted. He never even got that far though as he made it clear early on that he wanted to stay in L.A.  Then Lakers gave him that dumbass 2+1 contract. With a Player Option.   This has Klutch written all over it."
