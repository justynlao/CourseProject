I’m actually a Kai Jones fan but I struggle to see him first round never mind top 20.  I actually think he stays another year in school
"Kai Jones has to go first round, right? I’d be shocked if he wasn’t top 20"
would that change anything Kai Jones for Texas did one the other day and he is 6'11 (which this might be a reference to)
He and bledsoe had to have laughed about [Kai Jones](https://twitter.com/LonghornNetwork/status/1364436842829942792) doing it or something.
I think he's memeing after that clip from Kai Jones went viral (6'10 freak athlete pro prospect at UT-Austin)?  &amp;#x200B;  If so that's hilarious
&gt;	24) San Antonio - Kai Jones - PF/C - Texas  Kai was really hoping to finally join a warm-weather team.

"He kinda came out of nowhere. He was a chunky undersized center so he didn't get hype even a year ago but he slimmed down and put out insane efficiency this year in the Turkish league. The Turkish league is arguably the second best national league in Europe after the Spanish one and is full of players where were like 4 year college players that were all-acc, previous draft picks, combine invites etc. He went off and got number 2 in rebounding, number 2 in scoring, number 2 in blocks at 70% TS as an 18 year old which is insane. He also had the most assists and most steals for any PF/C that league as well. It seems strange that Alperen putting up these insane numbers but someone like Kai Jones putting up 8 points a game in NCAA is going to be picked higher."

"My unpopular hot take: Cade is the top prospect now, but I have a feeling that Green can become a better player down the line. That guy is already advanced as a scorer for his age with unreal athleticism  1. Cade 2. Green 3. Mobley 4. Suggs 5. Kuminga 6. Barnes 7. Moody 8. Davion 9. Bouknight 10. Shariffe Cooper/Kai Jones"
"This is pretty wild. I like Barnes, but the top 5 is pretty set. I’d go:  1. Cade  2. Mobley  3. Suggs  4. Green  5. Kuminga   6. Keon Johnson  7. Josh Giddey  8. Scottie Barnes  9. Franz Wagner  10. Kai Jones  I do like BJ Boston though."

"I'm hoping Allen and Okoro can help get their defense up to par.   Maybe they could get a guy like Kuminga, Scottie Barnes, or Kai Jones in the draft to develop into a good defender at the 4 and let SexLand run the offense."
"How low would you have to fall before you consider Sengun or Kai Jones?  VanVleet, Trent Jr, OG, Pascal and Kai/Sengun with Flynn and Boucher off the bench could be intersting."
I really tried this week to incorporate more consensus mock than I have in past weeks - particularly Davion Mitchell going lottery and Keon going over Moody. I still think I may be having Kai Jones go a bit too late. Dosunmu I moved up a bit too based on what a lot of post-MM consensus is coming out with.

As long as we don’t draft another &lt;6”2’ guard I’ll be happy. Kai Jones looks pretty good and I’d be quite happy with him if he ends up as our pick.

Kai Jones
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
"I’m thinking we can snag Isiah Jackson or Kai Jones at 12. It would also be pretty cool if we found a way to trade up for Mobley, but I’m not holding my breath.  But I already know we’re going to lose that coin flip, I’m pretty sure God hates us."

Kai Jones is not a great prospect go head to r/NBA_Draft and you’ll see some scouting reports on him. If Sengun is available at 11 he would fit very well on that roster. And I don’t think bouknight falls below pick 9.
The median between wherever Kuminga and Kai Jones go.
"Pre draft Wiseman  - 5 to 8ish. In a tier with Kuminga, Barnes and maybe a couple of others. Ie. High potential but a heap of question marks. Puts him definitely below the top 4 and well below Mobley as the top big.  After seeing this season. Anywhere from 8 to 20. We saw nothing good really this year and a few red flags. I see him now on par with Sengun and Kai Jones. All 3 have positives and negatives, and all could justifiably go anywhere in that range."
No 1 Detroit Pistons - Cade Cunningham  No 2 Houston Rockets - Jalen Green  No 3 Cleveland Cavaliers - Evan Mobley  No 4 Toronto Raptors - Jalen Suggs  No 5 Orlando Magic - Jonathan Kuminga  No 6 Oklahoma City Thunder - Scottie Barnes  No 7 Golden States Warriors -  Moses Moody  No 8 Orlando Magic - James Bouknight  No 9 Sacramento Kings - Franz Wagner  No 10 New Orlean Pelicans - Cory Kispert  No 11 Charlotte Hornets - Usman Garuba  No 12 San Antonio Spurs - Alperen Sengun  No 13 Indiana Pacers - Josh Giddey  No 14 Golden States Warriors - Jalen Johnson  No 15 Washington Wizards - Ziaire Williams  No 16 Oklahoma Thunder - Kai Jones  No 17 Memphis Grizzlies - Keon Johnson  No 18 Oklahoma Thunder - Jaden Springer  No 19 New York Knicks - Davion Mitchell  No 20 Atlanta Hawks - Jared Butler  No 21 New York Knicks - Chris Duarte  No 22 Los Angeles Lakers - Tre Mann  No 23 Houston Rockets - Trey Murphy III  No 24 Houston Rockets - JT Thor  No 25 Los Angeles Clippers - Sharife Cooper  No 26 Denver Nuggets - Ayo Dosumno  No 27 Brooklyn Nets - Isaiah Jackson  No 28 Philadelphia 76ers - Cam Thomas  No 29 Phoenix Suns - Josh Christopher  No 30 Utah Jazz - Quentin Grimes  Thoughts?
"big fan of Moody. Also dont think Sengun is a reach at that pick, really a big fan of his defense and IQ. Usman Garuba and Franz Wagner are two that I like. Think Jalen Johnson is a good high upside pick but he's a bit of a project.  Not a fan of Kispert or Williams. I like Kai Jones for the right team, but dont think the Kings are it.  Everyone else I like at that pick range is a guard."
"Part of me thinks they need to go with a high upside forward - so any of Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson or Josh Giddey.  Kai Jones also makes sense if they think they're going to be out a big with Richaun Holmes potentially leaving. Also Kai Jones is supposed to be a half-decent 3-point shooter which would be nice against Bagley."
"Kai Jones and Alperen Sengun will both fall outside of the top 15.     Jonathan Kuminga will fall at least to the Warriors at #7.     Rockets/Cavs will take Green/Suggs leaving Mobley to the Raptors, who will win a ROY in Toronto."
"The list of available centers this offseason isn't great; Daniel Theis (plenty of teams will be bidding for him), Nerlens Noel (not bad, but is more of a backup than starter), Richaun Holmes (great offensively, poor defender) and from there it gets worse and worse.  They could also draft a center (I'm high on Kai Jones) but centers take a few years to develop and as I mentioned, the clock is already ticking with LaMelo in today's NBA. Sabonis, for all of his flaws, is an All-Star level talent that Charlotte can immediately surround him with."
"As a rockets fan I'd love this but it still feels like an overpay for Wood given how loaded this draft class is (Who those 7 and 14 picks will translate into could look like Kuminga + Sengun, Kai Jones, etc.). Rockets would likely give up their 23 or 24 pick in this years draft as well, or some other pieces."
Yeah I was just referring to what I thought the Spurs first round was.  I’d take Giddey or Kai Jones with that
I don't trust sengun measurement i think there stat padding it. I want Wagner or moody. Or kai Jones   But ur right for the Murray one  speak of it again I shall kill u myself 😛😜
I agree although obviously the highest upside guy isn’t always the guy you go with. I think 12 would be fair for him tho. Just think there’s safer options in the 7-9 range that’s all.  I’d like some other options a bit better for your spurs tho like Giddey. Or even if a Bouknight/Moody somehow falls there. Kai Jones just seems like a guy the Hornets would jump on
Cavs going to take Kai Jones
I’m all in on Kai Jones and Jalen Johnson then if those 2 are gone I will angrily accept Ziaire or Sengun.   I hate the fact that Giddey is mocked to us so much but that’s a topic I can spend 10 minutes on so I’ll leave that alone lmao
I'd rather play the slots than bet on Kai Jones.
"So...probably not Kai Jones.  Don't get me wrong, I think he definitely has potential and actually hope he is available for the Spurs at #12, but he still looked very raw in his time with Texas."
So they're not picking Kai Jones then
"more from Ford:  What will Golden State do with two lottery picks?  “The Warriors are definitely open to trading out of the draft, and with picks 7 and 14, they may be able to get what they covet in return: a youngish starter who can help the team compete right away.”   Will the Lakers get a draft steal? Looks like a strong possibility.  “Kai Jones won’t help you right away, but he could be a great get this late in the draft.”    The Knicks have four picks in the NBA Draft. Who will they target?  One major clue: “Tom Thibodeau loves players who can defend two positions, make plays and shoot the basketball.”"
See I think they'd actually draft a center. Kai Jones projects to be available.

"Late but the way the roster was constructed last season they DESPERATELY need a stretch 4! Early on Pop decided to glue Trey Lyles to the bench which left Lamarcus, Eubanks and a young player named Luka Samanic who was never going to get decent minutes.   So Lamarcus gets bought out,Luka spends a lot of time in the G league, and Lyles is riding the bench. They signed Gorgui Dieng to mitigate our lack of depth but it was still a glaring hole on our roster.  So now that the Spurs have a lot of cap space to work with I can see why some feel John Collins may be that piece the Spurs need. He spaces the floor and can put up some good numbers and he’s still really young. Add in their semi high draft pick I can see a guy like Kai Jones (hopefully) falling to the Spurs, however another glaring issue for the Spurs is their atrocious 3pt shooting so they just may opt for a pure shooter in the draft"
"Kai Jones and Alperen Sengun would be there. The Raps would likely be all over this deal. I think Philly is the least likely to do it, they'd want some picks or something"
"Calling it now. No one went to Cade's birthday party, so Pistons take Green first. Rockets panic and stick with Evan Mobley. Cavs pull a cavs and take Kai Jones 3rd. Cade gets drafted by Toronto and is able to use his toronto mans voice everyday"

"Give CP3 the bag. You know Sarver will probably cheap out.  Use the rest at Duncan Robinson.  Use the draft capital on a guy like Kai Jones, and Ayo Dosumu"
Pretty sure Kai Jones also voted for himself
"SGA and Dort will be better, but you have to keep in mind who else will get heavy minutes next year.   -	The Thunder currently have 5 draft picks in this draft (likely consolidate to 3 or 4 by draft day). This will probably result in drafting 3 first rounders this year. Rookies VERY rarely play good defense/winning basketball. -	Poku, while hopefully improved, likely won’t contribute to winning basketball for another year or two.  -	Bazley is still a pretty big question mark.  -	There is currently no center on the roster.   So despite Shia and Dort being a little better next year, I think giving Bazley, Poku, Scottie Barnes, Kai Jones, and Ziaire Williams (just throwing out potential draft picks) all significant minutes will bring this team WAY down next year. I really don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility that this team is worse next year than they were this past year (when Shai was healthy) due to all the “developmental” minutes going around. As long as there’s no major shakeups to the roster, I think this team is back around the 5th or 6th worst record next year (even with Shai healthy all year)."
Why is Kai Jones falling so much in many mock drafts
Kai Jones will not fall below 20

"There are plenty of guys in the draft that aren’t projects.  If they needed someone to contribute right away, butler or Duarte would be good picks.  And even some of the younger guys like springer and cooper are pretty polished and not projects.  A few of the bigs like Kai Jones and Greg brown are projects but it’s not like you have to draft them.  I just wonder if the thunder would’ve played ball with a future first instead of the 2021 pick."
"It's not. And I didn't say it's bad. As I said I like Moses.   However, YOUR point is that the 16th pick is essentially useless.   Yet the guy you use went undrafted in 2019.   In 2019 could've taken guys like Thybulle, keldon Johnson, KPJ, Moses, etc    In 2020 could've gotten you the likes of Precious, Saddiq, Isaiah Stewart, Maxey, McDaniels,     2021 mocks could have the 16 potentially land the likes of Kai Jones, Isaiah Jackson, Zaire Williams, Josh Giddey, Garuba    Hardly a pick with no value lol"
Kai Jones probably doesn’t make it to 16. Isaiah Jackson I could see and he has a lot of upside.
Kai Jones future OKC legend
"lol no, but ball stans will eat it up like he is. legit seen some comments calling bouknight and kai jones a ball hogger cause they didnt pass it to him more"
"Obviously biased but the Hornets.

Hornets were a 4th seed until injuries derailed the whole season last year. I don’t think they’ll be a top 4 seed but I think it’s realistic to say that they can grab the 5 or 6 seed at best."
kai jones is on the hornets
"They have the bones of a similar team structure, both Jarrett Allen and Kai Jones are pretty good pieces."
"LaMelo, Rozier, Bouknight, Hayward, Bridges, Washington, Kai Jones are the clear 7 that every Hornets fan should have. Really tough decision between McDaniels, Oubre, and even Plumlee, but I'm going  McDaniels. Oubre becomes a lock to be picked up by the expansion team, and one of Carey, Thor, or Plumlee might also.  Doing an expansion draft after free agency will yield a way better expansion team than doing it at draft time, since we have to burn protected spots rookies and free agent pickups."
He was absolute horse shit in college and only started over Kai Jones cause he was a one and done freshman.
"if Jalen green did this dunk, or even Kai Jones, it'd be a much bigger deal. even in summer league this shit is ridiculous. there's a reason people said brown might be the best pure athlete in the draft even if he generally doesn't know how to play basketball lmao"
"Every big from Texas the last 3 years can jump out of the damn gym  Jax Hayes, Kai Jones, Jericho Sims, Greg Brown    All ridiculous athletes"
"He was #50 in his class and was playing behind first round picks pretty much every year.  Texas has mismanaged a lot of their program, but their development of bigs is not where they struggle.   Past 5 years:  Kai Jones #51 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 19th pick  Jericho Sims #50 prospect in class -&gt; 2nd round, 58th pick  Jaxson Hayes -&gt; #102 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 8th pick  Mo Bamba -&gt; #3 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 6th pick  Jarrett Allen -&gt; #17 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 22nd pick  Myles Turner -&gt; #6 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 11th pick"
"Not a player but the Hornets are gonna be a blast to watch. Melo’s passing surrounded by Oubre, Bridges, &amp; Kai Jones leaping ability. + Bouknight"
"Kai Jones, Kuminga. Love watching young athletic freaks.   For the Bucks, Mamu is interesting. Almost definitely won’t be in the rotation but has a nice offensive skillset especially if the shot translates. High IQ player and pretty mobile for his size."
"Kai Jones, kuminga, THT, Nix, Kispert, reddish, Davion Mitchell, Bagley"
Kai Jones!
I think Kai Jones will develop excellently and end up being one of the best players this decade
"The Spurs either see great things in Primo's future(believeable), saw something they didn't like in Sengun, or both. Because yeah, everyone thought we were gonna take him or Kai Jones. I'm glad we didn't take Kai Jones tho"
"I know he’s just a rookie, but Kai Jones. He was #7 on my draft board because I think his ceiling is absolutely insane. He’s a project that will take some time to develop (and him going to Charlotte made me a little less confident he’ll reach his ceiling), but I think he has the biggest superstar potential of anyone from this draft who didn’t go Top 5."
Kai Jones looks promising
But u do with raw af Keon Johnson and kai Jones  Wtf  Also stop sengun is not going to be that good. Doesn't really push us forward in tryna contender. Someone like chat Paolo and Duran will and could
"Hi! OKC fan here! I love giddey but no way hes better than Kuminga. I love Tre Mann but hes not better than Sengun, kai jones, jalen johnson. We really messed up. now we wait for Zion to request a trade"
"Primo will prove them all wrong.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but he will.      That being said, if Kai Jones ends up being legit then we fucked up."
This is it. And Kai Jones and Bouk.
Kai “The Mortician” Jones. 🤘
"Hornets for sure.  Wait till Eric Collins get to call Kai Jones and Kelly Oubre in addition to LaMelo, Terry, and of course MILESSS BRIDGESSSSS"
It was a fun game even the result didn't go the way I would've liked. Nice showing by Bouknight. Some highlights from Kai Jones.
"Game of the Summer League so far, high scoring back-and-forth affair the whole way down the line. Tre Jones is a legit NBA point guard, super poised and kept hitting big shot after big shot. Excited to see him on the team this year.  Bouknight is the truth and Kai Jones is ridiculous."
So what I'm reading here is you want to give Kai Jones a rim job?
"If you pretend the basketball is a donut hole and the rim is my mouth, I'm a lot like Kai Jones."
This Kai Jones dude is fun to watch
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Damn, sorry Kai Jones"
They took Bouknight.     Not hard to see why they passed actually when he was off the board in every mock.    Got Kai Jones later for cheaper and may not have paid the price for Sengun
"I’m a Texas fan. He was a really late bloomer, came into college really raw and had some trouble carving out minutes early. Doesn’t help that he played behind lottery picks (Bamba and Hayes) his first two years. Put it together really well his senior year, but even then he was more of a utility player that did all the small things, never really took over games.   His ceiling is likely as a rim-running big off the bench who can anchor the paint, and he probably has a place in the league. But compared to Kai Jones (also a Longhorn), the upside just isn’t anywhere close."
Is he realted to Kai Jones? They look exactly the same but I can't find info linking them to each other anywhere
Kai Jones
Yeah he got dunked on by Kai Jones
"Lmao, it's always a good investment!  I really am nervous about Bouk from a prospect perspective. Slightly older , only 15 games or so of good shooting, painfully low assist rate, and gets a bit tunnel visiony. But he had some nice fluid moments last night, and we know he can score. Considering your options as a Hornets team filled with some fun young guys, I'd wait.  Kai jones is an absolute black box. No idea what to make of him yet, besides that he jumps put of the gym."
"Ball Rozier Hayward Bridges Plumlee  Ish Bouk Oubre PJ and then one of Cody Martin, McDaniels, Kai Jones"
"Okay?   So because of that you think he will completely change the way he has played basketball his entire teenage and young adult life and will develop a completely new skill set and will be given the reps to put it all together in NBA games?    Sounds absolutely ridiculous to me. I think it’s more likely they develop his set three point shot so teams have to actually guard him from the three point line and he can provide spacing, teaching him how to utilize his ridiculous athletic gifts so he can dominate defensively, teach him to lead the fast break like draymond does and teach him to maybe get closer to 70% from the line and maybe one day even close to 80% if he can make progress    The raptors do have an amazing development staff but they don’t completely change a player lol.   If Kai Jones was drafted by the raptors do you think they could turn him into a scoring center like Karl Anthony towns?  No of course not because that isn’t how he has ever played basketball at a high level so why do you expect Barnes to completely change his game?"
I have too! That Kai jones had me salivating… if he develops he could be scary
"Barnes does not have a high offensive skill ceiling. He has a very low starting point and his style of play isn’t that of an offensive star, he also won’t be given that kind of role with any team.    That just isn’t how he plays basketball. What’s so hard for you people to understand    I keep going with this comparison because it shows how flawed your logic is. You may as well say Kai Jones has Nikola Jokic potential. Who cares if Jones isn’t close to having that skill set and dosent play that style of basketball   “He’s young and can develop so it’s possible”"
Nice non argument. People always gotta resort to lazy insult like that when they have no point.    You think a dude is gonna drastically change his style of play and gain a whole new skill set to magically fit your ideal version of his potential and you are calling me the moron.    Hilarious    You might as well say Kai Jones has Nikola Jokic potential and Josh Giddey has Larry bird potential
"King Kai seems to be the frontrunner in our sub right now. A lot of people already call Miles Bridges “Sky Miles”, so Sky Jones would unfortunately be a bit duplicative."
"Hornets went from a garbage team nobody wants to watch outside Hornets fans and MJ stans to ""HOLY SHIT LAMELO BALL GONNA LOB IT TO KAI JONES/BRIDGES/BOUK"""
You are going to be getting a lot of “Kai Jones with the huge slam” notifications this season.
"Kai Jones, Jericho Sims, and Greg Brown highlights all today. And Matt Coleman playing well. Surely that Texas team didn’t get upset in the first round of the NCAA tournament!"
This Summer league should just be a non-stop battle between Jericho Sims and Kai Jones over ridiculously athletic dunks.
"Eric Collins is going to have an absolute heart attack with the amount of sauce on this team.  LaMelo, Rozier, Hayward, Bridges, PJ, Bouknight, Kai Jones, Oubre."
Kai Jones next Giannis confirmed. League fucked. GG.
He always scared me more than Kai Jones whenever my school played Texas. Glad we picked him up. Anyone know where I can see a box score?
Kai Jones has that potential
Just fuck PJ Washington and Kai Jones I guess
"In 2024 we'll have choices like Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, Kai Jones (just drafted), Myles Turner, etc.  sorry i think you might be able to find my bias lmao"
"We got rid of Zeller and Biz, and now have Miles Plumlee, two young centers we drafted last year (Vernon Carey Jr and Nick Richards), small ball PJ at the 5, and Kai Jones.   So I'd say it's improved a fair bit, but it's not amazing. I'm expecting bigger things for Richards and VCJ this year. We'll probably be alright."
"Your guard and wing rotation is looking pretty nice now, but I feel like you haven't really improved at PF/C. Hornets not done making moves? Kai Jones getting a lot of minutes as a rookie?"
"Kai Jones is much too raw to be playing reliable minutes of any sort this season, no matter how short the spurt. At least, we can’t make that bet yet.  Lauri is a good shooter but not great at anything else. He plays bad defense and I’m betting that would be greatly emphasized against other centers, especially considering his atrocious post game.  This is why our subreddit was greatly rooting for us to get any center, like Holmes, Noel, or Allen."
"I can’t lie and say I’m not intrigued by LiAngelo. Excited to see Riller, Bouk, Kai Jones and Vern"
"I imagine this is what it would look like. If Bouknight isn't ready for full time backup minutes, Oubre plays more of a swing role and McDaniels takes on more minutes at the 3.  Ball/Ish Smith   Rozier/Bouknight/Martin/Martin   Hayward/Oubre/McDaniels   Bridges/Washington/Thor   Plumlee/Kai Jones/Carey/Richards"
"I don't think they would have let Kuminga into the G league if he was super raw.  He isn't nearly as raw as Kai Jones for instance.  I wasn't watching the G League games, but I believe it was the intentions of the Ignite coaches to have Kuminga be the primary scorer.    Kuminga is a really good athlete and will have some advantage almost every other player depending on the match-up whether that be height, strength, or speed.  Kuminga is young and has the body he does despite that.  There are older players with concerns as to whether they will be able to add muscle or not.    Almost every other player in the draft has been playing longer than Kuminga has.  There is more room to grow for him than possibly every other prospect.  When comparing him to other players at the top of the draft class, Cade and Barnes are expected to be better distributors.  While that certainly matters, I don't expect Barnes to be the primary ball handler at the NBA level and I suspect Cade's best role might not be at point guard either.  So them being better at distributing might not be as significant as it otherwise could be.  Giddey was drafted before Kuminga and Giddey should be a better distributor, but isn't close to being the same level of athlete.  There is a ton to like about the Warriors draft because both Kuminga and Moody could be excellent players and they were steals relative to their draft position."
"I keep thinking they're gonna throw Wiggins, Kuminha, Kai Jones, and wiseman at the Wizards for Beal."
"Not quite sure of some of the Spurs' off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner). They preferred going for Jimmy Butler and some cheaper bigs like Millsap and Bro-Lo. Either that or wait a year for Durant in 2016.  - drafting Primo over Moody, Alperen or Kai Jones  - drafting Vassell over Halliburton   Pop's best bet to secure the future would actually be to play all the young guys hard but try and somehow tank for Victor Wembanyama or Emoni Bates."
"He deserves to go out whichever way he chooses.   Although, not quite sure of some of their off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner).

"Cutting loose Monk, Graham, Zeller, Biz, Wanamaker was supposed to get us approaching 30M prior to Plumlee and the second rookie in Kai Jones. My math might be wrong but I'm not understanding how we got all the way down to $13M, we should be closer to $20M unless I'm way off on something. More if the unguaranteed Martin twins are cut and Richards can be cut and stretched."
Saving this comment and coming back when Kai Jones averages 37/15 and 13
That's because Kai Jones is on the Hornets (traded up with the Knicks to get him on draft night)
Why not just keep Kai Jones? Stretch 5 center
"Hornets probably do that especially since they drafted  Kai Jones, not sure if the Pacers would though."
"My name is Kai Jones and I've been wearing #22 in rec league since before this guy was playing. This is gonna be tough- Although I really like him, so I'll only request half of his contracts."
"Thanks also if you want to include them here are the first round draft pick trades  * Knicks recieve: Hornets future first round, Hornets recieve: Pick 19 (Kai Jones) * Knicks recieve: Pick 25 and future 2nd rounder, Clippers recieve pick 21 (Keon Johnson) * Thunder recieve: 2 future picks, Rockets recieve: Pick 16 (Alperen Sengun)"
"Lamelo really made that team must watch tv. Him, Bridges, Bouknight, and Kai Jones gonna be highlights waiting to happen every game  Although I will say I think we’ll be super fun to watch too when healthy. Shai’s incredible, Giddey gonna be making Lameloesque passes and the nightly Poku experience is unlike anything else in the league"
"well he didn’t go at 8 and sources said Charlotte was pretty dead set on Kai Jones before Bouknight fell, most mocks by pro scouts also had him after 17 and this source just said he’s not who they even traded up to get"
"Horford is going to eat up minutes that would have gone to Sengun/Garuba/Kai Jones instead, and he's unable to play the 4. I'd much rather have a rookie + Robert Williams instead of Horford/Moses + Willaims. Horford is not part of our future and doesn't push us over any sort of hump."
"We were literally 4th in the East and right at .500 until:  Gordon Hayward gets hurt.  LaMelo gets hurt.  Devonte Graham hurts his hip.  Miles Bridges gets Covid.  Cody Zeller gets hurt and misses some time.   We're not nearly as bad as most people want to think we are. Kai Jones is raw, yes, but he could easily be an excellent player down the road. Obviously hard to tell right now, so it's foolish to think--today--that whoever the Knicks *might* get will be better than Kai.   Lot of NY copium in this thread."
"If it conveys next season, it could easily be higher in the draft than the pick the Hornets received, hence probably not a great trade.  I expect Knicks will get a better prospect than Kai Jones with it.  I expect Hornets to make postseason at least a couple times in that timeframe, but tough to predict when.  Hornets aren't only lotto team in East that thinks they will make playoffs next season - Chicago and Indy as well.    Knicks and Wizards each have a good chance to miss postseason, so there definitely is room though."
"Charlotte screwed the pooch last night.  Bad trade with Knicks right there, pick they gave up is more valuable than one they received.    And they draft two bad passing players that don't mesh at all with how their team wants to play.  One of whom, Kai Jones, was a serious reach."
Kai Jones..? Garuba..? There were definitely defensive bigs left when they drafted...
Mitch did a fine job last night but I woulda been more worried if bouknight didn’t fall I think he was actually gonna take Kai Jones at 11
"Why didn’t the spurs draft Sengun, Jalen Johnson or Kai Jones when we don’t have a single power forward on the team?"
kai jones at 19
"GS is going to be an interesting one. We've seen guys like Moody slip many times and sometimes it's for a reason, other times the teams regret overthinking it. They actually could have just added two really great prospects or 2 guys that slipped for a reason. Or 1 of each. Only time will tell.  I love the Charlotte trade. I can see the team they are building. Kai Jones wasn't my favorite player, but he's going to fit well running the floor and catching lobs. Bouknight is also a great player imo.  Then you have the Magic who finally seem to not solely be focused on length and upside (I half expected them to draft Kuminga at 5 lol). I am interested to know why Toronto passed on Suggs. They have a good FO, but everybody in the basketball community seems to love Jalen's attitude and work ethic.  Biggest underwhelmers for me were definitely Memphis and Philly. Memphis is now eating a ton of salary to take a guy that probably would have been there at 17. Philly needs to make some moves and it seems like things are falling apart for Morey quickly.  Celtics and Mavs also had surprisingly quiet nights imo."
"Worst draft pick of the night. The entire Spurs scouting team and management should be forced to donate their salary for the entire 2021-2022 season to a worthy charity. Seriously this guy had 1 team that had him as 1st round pick, they were drafting at the bottom of the draft. The Spurs must have forgotten it's 2021, and thought they were back in 2012 or something picking from the back of the draft order again.  I hope I'm wrong in this kid develops and becomes a star, but there is no way he becomes a star in time to make a difference next season. They need Big Men, they have 2 post players guaranteed on their roster for the 2021-2022 season and Keldon Johnson who's forced to play as a defacto big man. The Spurs actually have a solid young team, but there were two glaring holes. 1st they lacked talented big men. Kai Jones, Alperen Sengun, Usman... they had their pick at 12. They could have had a big that would help at least eat up some minutes next year.   At least at 41 they took a guy who can help with perimeter scoring, but he's another guard not a big. I'm hoping they are able to land some quality free agent biggs that went undrafted and again when NBA free agency started, but barring Kawhi coming back this pick likely means they might not win 25 games next year. What a terrible ending for a legendary coach.  The Spurs draft philosophy is just stupid and out of wack. Trying to be the smartest guys in the room, but actually doing dumb crap. The Spurs are a great organization and once again I hope I'm wrong, but some times doing what is 'expected' is the actual smartest thing you can do."
"No, it’s a bad pick because they already have the back court of the future in Fox and Hali.. there are still better prospects at the wing and forwards like Zhaire Williams, Moses Moody, Chris Duarte and big like Kai Jones or Alperen Sengun on the board..  Davion is not gonna be effective next to Fox and Hali and that is just not gonna help the Kings nor Davion develop anything"
I think the Hornets (Bouknight and Kai Jones) or Magic (Suggs and Wagner) won
"Plumlee/Kai Jones/JT Thor/Vernon Carey/Nick Richards/PJ Washington is the full list of guys who’ll likely play at C. Richards is absolutely ass so I doubt he’s on the roster past next season, PJ is a smallball 5, Plumlee is the vet/likely starter and the rest are projects."
Makes for great clickbait thumbnails years down the road when someone makes a video titled “KAI JoNeS WaS AlMoSt a kNiCk” though.
I like this pick for the Wizards tbh. Dude’s a ball of energy. I don’t really get what separates him from Kai Jones tbh
"We’ve liked Kai Jones throughout the draft process and he was even linked to us at 11, nothing wrong with us getting our guy here if that’s what the FO scouting says. If he turns out to be a bust then it’s obviously a bad move but he’s someone who they wanted prior to the draft"
yeah im actually a fan of tre rn but i feel like garuba or kai jones was kinda better for yall
Do we know the protections on the pick that we (Charlotte) sent  to New York for the Kai Jones pick?
"Honestly I heard Kai Jones and it made me think of Mike Jones, so I was trying to get a response of “KAI JONES”, but looking back I definitely see why nobody picked up on that"
Kai jones seems dope man 🔥
"nice one, hornets Hornets need a center like Kai Jones who can rely on Lamelo's pick and roll play"
Kai Jones right now is more of an athlete than a basketball player.
LeMelo going to throw some sick lobs to this kid Kai Jones.
"Kai ""King Kai"" Jones"
Kai Jones and Bridges on the same team. That's a lot of athleticism
Kai Jones is a wild card.
"Meh, I guess Kai Jones was a bullet we wanted to dodge anyway so we probably aren't risking whoever we want with the other pick.  ... Please don't trade the other pick."
If Kai Jones becomes a star I will jump off the GW bridge
"Ok here’s my hot take of the day, Kai Jones is my dark horse pick for first team all rookie especially getting feeds from LaMelo"
I think you’re confused. He’s off the board and now we can’t take him! Or Kai Jones! Or Tre Mann! This could not be going any better
1. Rubio 2. Duncan Robinson probably 3. Norman Powell is pretty small for a forward  4. Giannis is pretty powerful for a forward  5. Kai Jones is almost dead center of last name in alphabetical order if you look at a list of nba players.
"You’re right, it’s easy enough to work around though. Either Charlotte could send a large salary back (like Plumlee, given they’d then have a young big man rotation of Kai Jones and wiseman), or some assets could be swapped around. Like this  Pacers: Wiggins, Kuminga, moody   Hornets: TJ Warren, James wiseman, Jeremy Lamb  Warriors: Hayward, Myles"
"Charlotte &gt; Washington &gt; Toronto   Idk why this isn't the consensus. Let's just look at the rosters real quick and see who people are over or under rating.  Charlotte: Lamelo, Rozier, Hayward, Bridges, Washington, Ish, Bouknight, Oubre, Plumlee, Jalen McDaniels, JT Thor, Kai Jones  Washington: Dinwiddie, Beal, Kuzma, Hachimura, Bryant, Neto, Aaron Holiday, KCP, Avdija, Kispert, Bertans, Trez, Gafford   Toronto: VanVleet, GTJ, Anunoby, Siakam, Boucher, Dragic, Barnes, Svi, Flynn, Watanabe, Dekker, Birch, Achiuwa  I see the Raptore as CLEARLY the worst of these teams. I think Charlotte is the the best, but tbh Washington is being underrated pretty heavily by most people in this sub."
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
Kai Jones had KD comps in some article this year. Not that I agree with that in any way.
Kai Jones is about to be the new JR Smith imo
"Toronto is in a transitionary period, but the question is whether they got more worse than the Hornets got better?  The Raptors guard rotation is weaker than the Hornets', though I think you are overestimating Ball slightly and underestimating VanVleet slightly.  I think its hard to argue that the Hornets frontcourt is better, Siakam and OG are more versatile options than Washington/Hayward; and I have no confidence that Hayward will stay healthy long enough to revert back to old Hayward and make it a contest between him and Pascal.  Centre is basically a wash between each team.  Last year the Hornets won 6 more games than the Raptors.   The respective factors in their issues were Lamelo's Injury and Hayward's for the Hornets.  COVID absences, Pascal/Kyle injuries and playing ~70 away games for the Raptors.  We lose Kyle over the offseason, gain Scottie Barnes, Dragic and Precious Achiuwa, likely a net negative in win shares.  Hornets get Oubre, Plumlee, Bouknight and Kai Jones, I would score that as neutral, maybe +2 win shares.  My confidence comes from believing that a healthy Raptors team that gets to play out of Toronto increases wins by 8-10. Whether that is enough remains to be seen, any gap in projected wins is made up by homerism.  My greater point is that you refer to teams getting significantly better in the last 2 years, for the Hornets their improvement is Lamelo Ball, Hayward and improvement from Rozier. In the last 4 years they finish 10th, 9th, 10th and 10th in the East. Their success this year depends on Lamelo growth, Rozier maintenance/growth and Hayward health, none of their acquisitions are big needle movers.  I don't think they belong in the conversation about why the Raptors no longer figure into the Playoff picture. And as for the Raptors not being contenders, that's pretty clear, but not because the Hornets are a juggernaut.  My confidence in 100 out of 100 matchups is just me saying if I was putting money on the head to head matchup, I'm taking the Raps."
"If he's replacing graham he needs to be NBA ready in 2 months.   I think gelo was decent, certainly better than most expected and was playing well until his last game. I think he earned g league roster spot as the rest of the hornets summer league outside of Bouk, Kai, and gelo was astonishingly bad. Eventually i expect gelo to make it as the 15th man on that roster cause he's better than thanasis.  Kai Jones was super interesting but he needs to develop a lot. Big potential though"
"5 would be real tight for deep teams  Even Charlotte would have to leave some real solid prospects/players on the table.  LaMelo, Bridges, PJ Washington are the obvious ones, then we'd have to leave two of Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Kai Jones, or James Bouknight unprotected. I'm gonna protect the rookies but only 5 protected players will never happen for an expansion draft. Minimum 7, probably 8."
"I have a hard time believing we got better. We tanked our guard depth which was a major strength. I see us about the same as last year once you factor in Oubre being the beneficiary of minutes when Hayward goes down instead of one of the Martin twins, and Plumlee being healthier than Zeller, not necessarily a better player.   Unless Bouknight or Kai Jones is an immediate contributor or another player completely blows up into a star, .500 is basically a realistic ceiling.  I think we're a play in team but wouldn't be shocked if we finished 11th. Would be more surprised to see us lock in a top 6 than miss the play in entirely."
Kai Jones is raw and will only see g league action for like a year or two. He has severe tunnel vision and doesn’t understand defensive positioning yet. The current backup bigs are pj and nick Richards. Bol bol can easily take Richards minutes.
"Charlotte already has better bigs... Kai Jones is a better C than Bol Bol, If you are being absurd and wanted to play him there"
yeah I really like the idea of getting turner for you guys. Honestly maybe give up Gordon to get him? I just tried the trade machine and Richards and Gordon for Lamb and Turner works. Lamb with 1 year left and a good spot up shooter opens up Cap to keep Bridges and Turner lets you push plumlee to the bench and give Kai Jones some spot minutes. Haywards a great facilitator but isn't the vocal vet presence that really helps this team develop.   I forgot about scary Terry. Really wish we'd kept him over Marcus (despite Marcus's winning plays^tm).   But yeah both our Williams are taking big steps this year and Al is going to help us a lot handle guys like Randle and Bridges (who I see as a similar player to Julius). We just need to stay healthy which since IT has seemingly been impossible.
Kai Jones baby
We already do. Just gotta let Kai Jones develop for a couple years
We have one in the Greensboro machine :Kai Jones
There's no way he can play Oubre significant minutes going forward. Hopefully PJ and Kai Jones can eat up some of those Plumlee minutes too.
Kai Jones will be the next great big man don’t worry
"Of course he isn’t available now, but you could have signed Wood instead of Adams. He was on your roster at one stage. JV might be better than Horford in a vacuum but Horford is 100% a better fit beside Zion and has been available the last two off seasons for peanuts. Finding a stretch 5 to play with Zion would be my priority if I was Griffin and he has so many assets to go out and get him. I guess part of the problem is you guys are rushing and trying to win now with Zion, because otherwise the best move would have been to draft a stretch 5 to develop beside Zion. A guy like Kai Jones who shot 38% from 3 last season."
"He's a solid roleplayer. Also an underrated passer for a big man. He's in the category of great backup but not necessarily a great starter (similar to JaVale McGee).  I wasn't into the NBA when he got overpaid by Denver, but I know he got traded to the Nuggets because the Jokic/Nurkic pairing wasn't working and they had to get off one of them. Was that during the 2016 cap spike?  As far as Charlotte goes, I think even Charlotte fans agree that they need a better center. Apparently they've tried to trade for Myles Turner multiple times and have been shot down. They drafted Kai Jones potentially as their center for the future, but it takes a few years for big men to really find their rhythm in the league. Plumlee was probably one of the best guys available that they could obtain."
"&gt;You want a Shai/Ayton PNR? I would, thats incredible.  It's less incredible when you have both on max contracts. You put Ayton on the Thunder this year and they're the what seed?  &gt;You want to bet on Kai Jones if youre the hornets?  It's not about Kai Jones vs Ayton in a vacuum, it's Kai Jones on a rookie contract vs Ayton on a max when you have to pay LaMelo soon and have Hayward and Rozier on the books, on top of probably re-signing Bridges as an RFA.   &gt;For the knicks Ayton is better at everything that Robinson and Noel do  Once again, not the calculation. Once you pay Barrett, Randle, and Ayton, that's your team, where do you go with that?  &gt;The rockets would pack the bags for every young big on that roster for a chance at Ayton for them  I don't think they would. Sengun has infinitely more offensive promise both as a post scorer and passer than Ayton. The guy just won MVP of one of the best Euro leagues as a teenager. There's a reason the analytics community was frothing at the mouth over him, and a reason the Rockets traded up to get him.   &gt;I really enjoy homes' energy but hes a sieve on defense  Defense is arguably Holmes' best skill. He was the best defender on the Kings last year by a distance.  &gt; A lineup of Lillard, Mccollum, Powell, Nance, and Ayton  Lillard(supermax), McCollum(max), Powell(18mill a year), Nance(10mill a year), Ayton(max).   You would have 2 good defenders in that lineup and be forced to fill the entire rest of the roster out with minimum players. I also literally don't know if the Blazers could do it cap-wise.  &gt;The mavs would throw Porzingis out the front door like Jazz in the fresh price for Ayton.  Once again, not feasible.  &gt;The celtics might be the quickest of them all to move Horford, Williams, or both.   Horford's contract isn't moveable.   &gt;Thats everything that want from Horford and Williams but better.  Except Williams can probably do that for like 12 million a year. I don't need to go from 12 mill/yr to a max for the same skillset."
"I think youre massively underestimating how teams would go after Ayton if he hit the market. SO many of the guys you mentioned teams sticking to would have taxis called for them in an instant to get Ayton in the door The thunder would instantly have a fantastic, young core with all their picks to supplement, they dont have a rim protector or finisher. Ayton fixes both issues instantly. You want a Shai/Ayton PNR? I would, thats incredible.   You want to bet on Kai Jones if youre the hornets? Its lunacy to look at Deandre Ayton and think, nah ill roll the dice on Kai Jones. Do I want to pair my star PG with one of the best Centers in the league or do I want to bet Jones finds a way to play defense and rebound in the NBA like he never did in college? Its not like Jones was even a better 3pt shooter in college than ayton was, but hey i guess hes from the bahamas too so hes got that going for him  For the knicks Ayton is better at everything that Robinson and Noel do, and has more in his bag. theres no reason to think the team that believes those guys are good to pair with their core but someone who is better in every way wouldnt fit. Hed be a perfect core piece  The rockets would pack the bags for every young big on that roster for a chance at Ayton for them, pairing Ayton with a 4 who can stretch the floor in Wood is a perfect combination. You tell the rockets that you can pair Green, Porter, Wood, and Ayton they sign up for it before you finish the sentence.  The kings would send Holmes out of town praying you took Buddy's contract with him faster than Fox can run the fast break. Who is better to pair with Fox and Haliburtan than a big in ayton who can run the floor better than some wings? Its a perfect combination and instantly solves their defensive issues at the rim as well. I really enjoy homes' energy but hes a sieve on defense  The blazers would see stars their heads would snap to attention so fast if they could ditch Nurkic and Covington for Ayton. A lineup of Lillard, Mccollum, Powell, Nance, and Ayton not only competes in the west, it keeps Lillard in town. This is a no brainer and the blazers front office might pray for the opportunity. Ayton solves their defensive issues at the rim instantly, gives them a big who can actually switch into space, and creates so much gravity around the rim Dame would feel like hes shooting in practice he would have so much space to operate. CP3 just spent a whole season doing this.   The mavs would throw Porzingis out the front door like Jazz in the fresh price for Ayton.   The celtics might be the quickest of them all to move Horford, Williams, or both. He would be the perfect big to pair with Brown and Tatum. Low usage, incredibly efficient, fantastic switchable defense. Thats everything that want from Horford and Williams but better.   I really think youre massively underrating Ayton, these teams would jump at the opportunity to get a player like ayton, even on a max"
"Downgraded on 3 solid contributors (Graham, Monk, Zeller) to 3 guys who probably will be bums (Ish Smith, Oubre, Plumlee). Bench will probably struggle hard this year unless we get some solid contributions from at least one unproven youngster like Bouknight, Carey, Kai Jones etc. Even if the starting core is very good or even gets better than last year it's tough to see us lasting with so little depth. Plus the east improved massively this past offseason so competition is harder."
"At one point in the third quarter Dallas had their full starters in against Ish Smith, Plumlee, Mcdaniels, Kai Jones and Bouknight and they were running plays lol"
Who is this Kai Jones guy and how in the hell was the 19th pick? Dude averaged 9/5 and started 4 of 26 games the year he was drafted. Watched last 5 min of the game and I was in shock when the announcers said he was the 19th pick.   Sharife Cooper was drafted 29 picks behind this dude?!
Cuz Kai Jones could be a top garbage time player to watch.
"Kai Jones 0-7 from field, 0-6 from FT.  Is this right??"
"If Hornets play Kai Jones in garbage minutes, he's gonna give some great highlights. Especially if Ish, a point guard, is getting garbage time minutes."
"I'm mildly worried about Vernon Carey not making the roster, he's hardly played in the preseason while bum ass Nick Richards plays.  I think I'd rather have an empty roster spot over Nick Richards or Wes Iwundu... maybe Cody Martin too, but I'm indifferent on him.   As long as our roster includes:   Ball/Smith   Rozier/Bouk   Hayward/Oubre/McDaniels     Miles/PJ/Thor   Plumlee/Kai Jones  I don't really care who the end of the bench guys are."
"charlotte - it’s almost like they are trying to build the most exciting team first, and a winning team second. bouknight is legit, but there were better players available than kai jones and jt thor. the organization said “fuck it” and drafted them based on athleticism and stylistic fit with lamelo, and im here for it. i think it’s easier to build a team that’s exciting every night rather than a team that wins every night."
Kai Jones
They drafted Kai Jones and traded for Plumme who gives them more defense. There wasn’t really a better move out there for them.
"I'd say them and the hornets. The hornets have Oubre, Bridges, Kai Jones, Rozier, and Lamelo who can all catch bodies..."
"I'm always partial to athletic true 7' bigs who can rim run but unfortunately he looked like a really bad player when he got minutes in garbage time. I expect him to be cut after training camp and for another team to give him a shot, since we have Kai Jones for that role now."
"LaMelo and four lob threats. Specifically, Bouknight, Oubre, Bridges, and Kai Jones.  We about to look like the Globetrotters on our way to the 8th seed."
"As a Hornets fan, I’d be willing to give Hayward to Philly if we could get at least one unprotected Minnesota pick + McDaniels + Naz Reid. Hayward played really well last year (best player on our team), but his timeline doesn’t match ours and his contract could age poorly. McDaniels/Reid would give us a great young core and some depth at forward, plus I’m not all that into Kai Jones/Vernon Carey/JT Thor as our Cs of the future.   This take will be more controversial amongst our fanbase, but I’d give Terry to Philly too if it meant getting Malik Beasley, Terry/Beasley occupy a similar niche but Beasley is younger and cheaper."
"we'd have to make a deal with New York to free up any picks before 2027.  We traded a very heavily protected 1st that can convey any time between 2022 and 2025 to draft Kai Jones. If we simply unprotected that pick for them, we'd be able to trade any of our picks from 2024 onwards, as well as the lotto protected 1st from NOLA. That's probably our only avenue to improve the roster now."
Kai Jones
"Highly Predictable L. Vuc could've gone for 40. Some fun crowd shenanigans at the end chanting ""Fire Nagy,"" then Eric Collins with the gem ""fans in Chicago used to be knowledgeable"" when they started chanting Lonzo Better.   Hurry up Kai Jones pls"
Kai Jones is extremely raw but probably deserves a shot at some point this season.
"Gotta be honest. He hasn't been remotely rotation caliber this year. Our center room is him, Nick Richards, Kai Jones, and Vernon Carey and I have no real desire to ever see Plumlee play again."
"My thoughts let's talk!  Timberwolves- No need to overreact coming off of a nice win steak. All of their known problems clearly on display tonight though. Once DLO, Ant, or KAT touch it there's an 80 percent chance that was the last pass. Maybe KAT will throw to a cutter from the post or DLO will get caught in the air, but that's probably it. They have enough offensive talent that this can be hidden (the win streak) but on nights like this it clearly hurts them.  Not many players who are elite on both sides aka 1 dimensional players and showed in their transition and close out defense. Hey maybe there's a reason the Hornets are getting off 40 threes let alone hitting the majority.   KAT continues to be insanely impressive effort wise and scoring but DLO despite some nice plays lack of awareness and defense is gross. Ant when his shot isn't falling doesn't move much and boy tonight he was off. Kinda comes down to Chris Finch to hammer in some basics of effort into his starters.  HORNETSSSSSSS- The most exciting team I keep up with. LaMelo comes out of the gate controlling the game WITHOUT scoring. He is only 20 and already a genius passer!! He punished the slow Wolves by pushing the pace AFTER scores just immediately sprinting the floor and opening up shooters. Not sure what the conesus on the fit is with Rozier but I love it as they both have been plus defenders and a very willing passing and fantastic transition player next to an elite half court scorer is good for me. Oubre continues to impress me on both ends. This isn't the first game he's had a big piece in the win. He has objectively made them better and whoever upvoted that weird post about Warriors and Suns are better without him are weird. PJ great return 5/7 from 3 and did as well as he could on KAT with his frame. Would have liked to see more Kai Jones minutes being how not so good their big man rotation is. Bouknight deserves better but what can you do, he'll get his eventually he is a true talent. The offense is pretty open without Plumlee but you need some sort of interior defense so. When the Hornets are active and locked in defensively it is great. their top offense is no problem and they are a team better than the record shows barring defensively typically. Wolves can make your defense look pretty good."
"In a few years I wouldn’t be surprised to see Kai jones on these lists definitely needs to bulk up but the fluidity and explosiveness he has for his size is rarely seen outside Giannis, not saying he is gonna be like Giannis as that would be asinine, but he’s similar in the sense that a young Giannis was when he came into the league needing to add size to that crazy frame"
Would love to see Kai Jones get some playing time.
Mitch really made some questionable trades on draft night. The first being trading for the 37th pick and receiving plumlee in that scenario which reduced the money left that we had to sign an actual center and the second being trading for kai Jones which doesn’t allow us to trade our first until it converts to the knicks.
MJ probably telling Kai Jones to give him the #23 right now
"&gt;With your team, it'd probably be a combination of PJ Washington and Kelly Oubre.   Agreed, I've brought up this exact package before and added Kai Jones as a replacement for a FRP (young lanky shot blocker from Texas, ring a bell?). PJ would be a nice fit with Sabonis."
"PJ, Mcdaniels, Kai Jones and Bouk. Send it in Mitch"
"Hornets!   LaMelo, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, Jokic would be unstoppable. Got a ton of athletes off the bench in Bouknight and Kai Jones too, and the hope is they’ll be ready in a couple years"
"yep in the gleague i also seen a comment about the coach not knowing how to use him to make him look good / taking him out cause he hot, not because somone like bouknight or kai jones (their first round picks) is coming in. and it went as far as it beocming a conspiracy theory of some sort lol"
Not Kai Jones lol.  I’d do Bouknight but not sure if Hornets do that.  Honestly don’t even want any more guards back
"Mason Plumlee has been hot garbage this year. If we had anybody else at center, he'd certainly be out of the rotation already, but nope, Mitch Kupchak looked at the roster and thought Plumlee, Kai Jones, Nick Richards, and Vernon Carey was good enough."
"Eh disagree, for what this team needs Kai Jones was a better pick"
"It's rare I go to bat for JB, but he's pretty far down the list of things wrong with the team at the moment. No coach is getting this team to the top 6 in the east as long as Mason Plumlee, Nick Richards, Kai Jones, Vernon Carey is our center rotation. We could cut all of them but Kai, replace them with free agents  like Noah Vonleh, John Henson, Harry Giles... And be noticeably better off than we are now, that's the state of our frontcourt. I thought Plumlee would basically be Zeller with less ball skills and more physicality but he hasn't even been replacement level, he's disgustingly bad."
Unfortunately we can't trade any firsts until 2026 because of the Kai Jones trade LMFAO
He didn't. The only team that could afford him was hornets but then they traded everything for Kai Jones and then signed plumlee for like 5 million less. They could've sign Holmes for like 4/57 or something. They were the only ones who had the money.
"I agree, which is why it's so baffling why Nick Richards is getting so few minutes and Kai Jones has yet to see the floor. Idk, maybe they're hoping Vernon Carey Jr. will bloom. He's in the G league rn"
"I wouldn't languish in despair yet. LaMelo is only in Year 2, and if you want to see what happens when a GM jumps into win now mode too fast, just take a look at Dallas.  Bridges looks great this year, and I was really high on Kai Jones in the draft. Big men do take longer to develop though."
I really just want to shit over Borrego because he's so uninspiring and just got comfortably outcoached by Luke Walton but I just can't because Mitch did such a piss poor job building this roster that I don't even think it matters. We drafted four guys this year including trading 5 years of protections for Kai Jones (can't trade our first rounders until 2026 yay!) and none of them are even close to seeing playing time. The bench is a confusing mess and the starters start off every game by putting us in a 12 point hole. We handed Terry Rozier a fat extension that starts next year and he responds by putting up 20% FG shooting nights with shit defense.  It's just so funny that we forced out Cho (previous GM) for going all in on a core that just wasn't that good and then handed the keys to a guy who does the exact same thing but with a team that didn't even make the playoffs. Can't wait to see what happens next
"Terry's had a career resurgence in Charlotte. Fun fact, he never shot above 40% in the regular season during his time in Boston.  Last season with Charlotte - 20.4 / 4.4 / 4.2 on .450 / .389 / .817. He might be an undersized shooting guard, but he fits perfectly as a secondary ballhandler next to LaMelo.  So yeah, I like the fit a lot and at the end of the day there's not a lot of teams that can pair Terry with a bigger playmaker.  Apparently Charlotte tried to offer PJ Washington, Cody Zeller and a 1st for Myles Turner. That's not a bad offer in my opinion, but we didn't take it. Nowadays if we were interested they'd have to include Oubre instead of Zeller for salary match.   We'll have to wait and see, but yeah I don't see Plumlee being the long-term solution. The idea of Kai Jones blossoming is neat, but centers take a long time to develop unfortunately."
We could have been watching Kai Jones but y’all not letting him play.
Shout out to Kai Jones leading with the team high in +/-
Kai Jones?
"No offense at all, but if you watched any Kai Jones last year you would not have expected him to help an NBA team out from day 1. He very well could become a good NBA player, but he was always going to be a project."
"Or we wind up having our wings dig so much on drives that we give up wide open threes (thank god we're not doing that so far this year, but might have to against someone like Embiid)  Point being, it's completely unacceptable to neglect the C position like Kupchak has. Kai Jones might be the answer in like 4 years, but if we're trying to do anything with the Hayward/Rozier timeline, don't do some half measure BS, go out and get a legit starter... plugging that hole with Mason Plumlee barely even qualifies as a half measure.  And the backup situation is rough, at least make it look like you care, by trying out some competent C's that don't have a team at the moment. Dieng, Vonleh... The idea of having Plumlee as a starter and Nick Richards as a backup in a playoff series against Embiid or even Adebayo/Capela is laughable."
"Just out of curiosity, what's the deal with Kai Jones? I was pretty high on him coming out of Texas and figured he'd help you guys out from day 1"
"Myles Turner is still gonna be a trade option especially if Indiana continues to struggle, I don't think our FO will stop making calls for him. Oubre is making himself a useful trade piece and even though we don't really have a 2022 pick to trade we could still throw in Kai Jones and PJ (I would really try to keep him at all costs though)."
"Kai Jones, JT Thor and even Nick Richards all not getting playing time seems rough. Plumlee is good but limited and can get lit up in certain matchups. Those guys can’t be that much worse."
hoping a klutch guy drops to the 2nd rounder so the lakers can buy in. guess it won't be Kai Jones
Fuck I wished the Knicks kept it for Kai Jones
Kai Jones!
Kai Jones looks like Jameis Winston
"I know that the Thunder aren't gonna be competing anytime soon, but if they were going for a developmental upside guy I think I'd have preferred Kai Jones and just grab Mann using other assets."
Kai Jones? Can this guy catch lobs?
Kai Jones is massively underrated dudes gonna be great
"Kai Jones, Keon Johnson, J.T. Thor, Jaden Springer, Sharieff Cooper, Jared Butler, etc… are all still on the board. We have options"
KAI JONES
Kai Jones?
Kai Jones incoming
"One of them will be there for us at 19. Any two of Cam Thomas , jalen Johnson and Kai Jones would be great. Will be so sad if the Knicks pass on all 3"
Kai Jones!!!
Kai Jones is a bust purely base on that suit choice.
Would like maybe Jalen Johnson and Kai Jones to fall to the Knicks.
How bout future picks and Kai Jones 👍
Sengun and Kai Jones would be ideal at 16 and 18.
"Kai Jones is probably going to fall quite a bit, he's got a ton of issues and wasn't even that good at Texas"
If Kai Jones falls to the Rockets……
Warrior fans who do you think is good i like either moody or kai Jones
I want the Spurs to get Kai Jones but they will most likely select Sengun
Charlotte needs to pick Kai Jones
I can already feel the Hornets stealing Kai Jones out of my hands
"Kai Jones is from the Bahamas? For a nation of 400k, it's amazing to have 3 NBA players. That has to be one of the highest foreign countries per capita."
That's Kai Jones  mom?
Kai Jones Drippy
Kai Jones and his dad showed out in those suits 🔥🔥🔥
"Christ, Kai Jones is a lanky guy"
"LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, Mason Plumlee.   Jason Preston, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, PJ Washington, Kai Jones."
No Kai Jones please
"I hope so. I only watched Cade less than a hand full of times, but each time walked away extremely unimpressed. Maybe it was high expectations after hearing how highly he was talked about, but he just seemed to sorta disappear for really long stretches of the game. One of the games I watched was when they played Texas and I remember thinking Kai Jones looked better than Cade.  I have never wanted to be wrong about a sport take more, but it's where I'm at 😔"
"Two low-floor high-ceiling prospects (say, Jonathan Kuminga and Kai Jones), neither of whom pans out"
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
"No clue, so I’m just gonna throw this out. Shoutout to anyone from 2026 if you’re reading this.   1) Jalen Green  2) Cade Cunningham  3) Alperen Sengun  4) Davion Mitchell  5) Kai Jones  6) Scottie Barnes  7) Someone from the 2nd round  8) Late 1st rounder  9) Jalen Suggs  10) Undrafted player  This is super random, so I’ll be intrigued to see how this looks in 5 years."
"I definitely expect Kai Jones to go to No. 11 at Charlotte. And that's a lot higher than people thought he would go about a month ago. Isaiah Jackson continues to be linked to the Knicks.   I think there's a real belief among NBA personnel that Barnes can go #4, but yes, it could certainly be Suggs."
"1) Is there anyone in this draft that you think/have heard rumbling about, that might go a lot higher than they're currently mocked to be picked, or anyone you think could have an unexplainable drop?   -------------------------------  2) Kai Jones and Isaiah Jackson seem to be two of the most polarizing players in this draft, with mock drafts having them anywhere from a borderline top 10 pick to sometimes even the 2nd round (more so regarding Isaiah Jackson). Any thoughts on them as prospects, and where you think they finally end up getting picked?   ---------------------------------  3) Scottie Barnes has seemingly exploded in media hype over the past week, with reports yesterday even saying Toronto could potentially pick him at #4. Is this just typical draft week over sensationalized hype to stir up discussion? Or is there truly something there?"
"Bust - Mobley, Kai Jones, Sengun, Kuminga, Sharife Cooper (o/u 23.5, really?)  Star - Cade, Green, Kispert (GOAT level shooter conversation)  Steal - Murphy (will go top-17ish and still be a steal), Hyland, Petty, Herb Jones, Queta, JT Thor, Wieskamp"
Kai Jones is gonna surprise a lot of people. Motor for days
Seriously I'd much rather take this than Kai Jones or Jalen Johnson
"Would rather get a cheap big in FA if we're just gonna take a big in the draft because we ""need"" one   From /r/CharlotteHornets this was a comment I agree with   &gt; ""feel like a ton of Hornets fans want guys like Kai &amp; Sengun to be the pick not because of what they offer as a prospect, but because they've looked at our dire need for a big man, saw Kai Jones &amp; Sengun exist, and just decided they would solve the problem (which, imo, they most definitely don't). Like, if you really want us to draft a big, we should just trade down and take a guy like Day'Ron Sharpe who has a pretty clear path to hitting a solid ceiling."""
**Kai Jones**
I’d be shocked if Wagner went top 7. I would think Orlando would go for Kai Jones first at 8 and Vlade takes Sengün at 9 so that’s why I say Wagner will be there at 10. We’ll see tomorrow.
"There’s a ton of interesting guards that could work out, for bigger guys, kai Jones or jt Thor are raw but have high ceilings"
"May be drafted higher than expected: Usman Garuba, Josh Giddey, Joshua Primo  May fall: Davion Mitchell, Kai Jones"
Kai Jones
I think Kai Jones is going to fall wayyyyy lower than people think. Also Keon Johnson isn’t going until the mid 20s.
"Kai Jones. Both because of the risk involved with his lack of actual performance and because I know the Spurs and understand he won't see game action for a long, long time as raw as he is."
"Part of it was giving him a shot at a change of scenery. He and Dejounte are friends and despite his contract status, I fully expect the Spurs to give him a strong look. As far as I know, he's been rehabbing and working out with the Spurs staff and he fills a positional need for us - a rim running big that can play some defense and give a different look than Jak off the bench.   I know alot of Spurs fans have their eye on bigger names, particularly with the #12 pick, but Chriss can already do what alot of them truthfully project to. Certainly a guy like Kai Jones has a massive upside but the risk that he doesn't get a sniff of said upside are significant. With Chriss, you know what you're getting."
Kai Jones
"Kai Jones will be last of the green room invites to be drafted, just my prediction.  Also, that Vrenz Bleijenbergh is a Buck by the end of draft night."
"The rumor is that Charlotte wants Kai Jones at a 11. If thats the case, I would much rather have Turner"
"I’d like to see the Spurs have Sengun fall to their lap, but I believe we will end up with Kai Jones."

"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
They may just be better off drafting a big - Kai Jones or Sengun come to mind.  If they think they’ll be available later in the draft they can trade back
no chance kai jones is drafted in the lottery unless david kahn is making the picks lol
"i think kai jones is falling out of the lottery, looking like he will be available at the late teens now"
"Jaxson Hayes exists too - had a decent year and still young.  Could have 3 guys drafted this year too, Kai Jones, Jericho Sims, and Greg Brown"
"&gt; What does Steven Adams bring other   Rebounding and screens.    &gt;than being an overpaid back up to a hopefully healthy JJJ.   JJJ is better at PF right now anyway. As Memphis can afford to overpay vets, we have heaps of players on very cheap deals.  &gt; and get the 10th pick where they can get the Center they need (probably Kai Jones from Texas)  They're giving the 10th pick TO memphis."
If I had to guess their target would be Kai Jones? I want them to take Davion Mitchell though.
Sengun or Kai Jones
"Idk much about their needs but maybe Moses Moody, Franz Wagner or Kai Jones would be a good fit and they’re all slotted around that area in the draft. Maybe Josh Giddey? Guess we’ll see"
Lmao if we draft Kai Jones I’m gonna fuckin shoot myself
"Kai Jones stinks, really hope that's not who they're targeting"
"Kai Jones, we think?"
"This is a bad trade for the Grizzlies. What does Steven Adams bring other than being an overpaid back up to a hopefully healthy JJJ. I don’t see where Bledsoe fits with the grizzlies either.   However Pelicans probably do well with this. They get a solid player in Valuncianas, and get the 10th pick where they can get the Center they need (probably Kai Jones from Texas). However that team still has no shooting.  And they have the cap space to resign Lonzo."
"I think I'd rather bet on Cam's upside at that point unless maybe if some player I/the team was high on dropped to 18.   Like, maybe if Kai Jones or Keon Johnson dropped to 18, but otherwise, I'd rather roll the dice on keeping Cam.  Late lotto is the range that I'd hope for/could see happening."
**Bahamas Starting 5**:  C-Deandre Ayton  PF- Kai Jones  SF-Mychel Thompson  SG-Klay Thompson  PG-Buddy Hield   Would this lineup win a medal?
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"I think you're saying the same thing. he's just also saying we should have tanked so we could get Scottie Barnes instead of Kai Jones, for example. personally I'm happy to take Sengun, he's my favorite guy after Scottie at 5 anyway so I'm not mad about it at this point. I will admit I was mad when we didn't trade DeMar and Rudy, though, because I didn't want to lose them for nothing."
"Kings should demand Simmons + Maxey for Fox + Bagley.  Would completely revamp the Kings defense.    Then sign Olynyk and Holmes in free agency, draft Moody or Kai Jones at 9 and bam that's a solid roster."
"2 years from now Kai Jones will be the player everyone will say ""How did we pass on that guy"""
"Yeah it does. They’re not paying Boucher when he expires, they get a prospect and another pick in the draft. They can use it to draft Sengun /Kai Jones or they can route it to Cleveland alongside #4 to move up and pick Mobley."

Kai Jones becomes giannis 2.0
"- Bouknight will bust  - Sengun will bust unless he’s drafted by the Spurs  - Jared Butler is making an all-rookie team &amp; regarded as the steal of the draft   - Evan Mobley has a disappointing rookie year   - Kai Jones will bust, next Jalen Smith  - Bones Hyland will shoot logo threes   - Cade becomes a top 15 player in the NBA in 4 years   - Jalen Suggs is the second best player in the draft behind Cade  - OKC trades with Cleveland for #3"
"I wonder if there's any play to get Orlando's 5th for FVV (and parts, if needed).  If going on full retool with OG seemingly being your senior-most starter, something like the following is MASSIVELY intriguing :  Raps hold onto their 4th  Raps trade FVV to Orlando for the 5th  Raps trade Siakam to GS for Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th &amp; 14th  Raps draft Suggs with their 4th  Raps draft Barnes with their 5th  Raps draft Bouknight with their 7th  Raps draft Sengun, Kai Jones or Garuba with their 14th (or trade for 14th for assets)  Aim for two of Wieskamp, Vrenz, Queta and/or Kessler Edwards with their 46th &amp; 47th  That is a bold as fuck - and probably very stupid, impossible and misguided - attempt at a rebuild that I honestly wouldn't mind seeing given we just recently won a championship and I don't see FVV or Siakam (as much as I love them) moving us beyond a treadmill team for the next few years.  Let Wiggins slide into the lineup for a year or two while starting Suggs and Barnes alongside OG and develop the hell out of Bouknight, Wiseman and Sengun until they're all ready to compete as one unit.   Total fantasy and probably bad fantasy at that, but I wouldn't hate it."
I mean that's why there intriguing  to look at via drafting. There a speciman  like kai Jones and Keon Johnson. If they meet what we  see of them. There amazing. If they don't well oof
Kai Jones will be the steal of the draft
"Isaiah Jackson ends up going mid-lottery and people will laugh at the pick cause most sites have him projected as a late 1st rounder or even a 2nd rounder depending on when you last looked, while some sites have him as high as like #12.    He goes in the lottery, shows himself to be the 2nd best ""true"" big man in the draft, and establishes himself as a defensive stud in the league.   ------------------------  Kai Jones' stock is gonna keep on plummeting next week and people will act like he might be available at the end of the 1st, before he's drafted in the lottery."
I swear the Hornets sub has been jocking Sengun's nuts over fucking Kai Jones
Great defender who can’t shoot. The presti special. I do think Barnes can improve and shoot like 35-36% from 3 or so. I’m just hoping we can snag one of Kai Jones or gengun with the 16th pick.
Kai Jones😕
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
"Keon Johnson and Kai Jones' stock seems to be falling off a cliff. They're both wildly higher upside picks than most of the guys in the range I've been seeing them mocked at recently, so I don't really get it.   Like, I'm one of the biggest Kai Jones pessimists, but there's no way a guy with his tools should drop to 24."
