‚ÄúFuck out of here.‚Äù - Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony
"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Victor Oladipo"
‚ÄúIs Carmelo Anthony a hall of famer?‚Äù  A post 20 days from now
Cries in Carmelo Anthony.
"It was deliberately named to result in an acronym that spells a word known to NBA fans. Like many acronyms, it chooses to take liberties with exactly which words it includes. The RAPTOR metric is an evolution of fivethirtyeight's CARMELO metric, obviously named for Carmelo Anthony and the full name was *Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization*."

"Hey hey hey, Carmelo Anthony isn‚Äôt trash, he‚Äôs old lmfao also def helped the blazers in some key situations last year. I‚Äôm a big Carmelo fan so lmfao"
Lol  Also stop fucking calling him Melo. Melo is Carmelo Anthony
"Carmelo fantards coming out in full force. Take the hoodie off and hop off my nutts. Carmelo Anthony is WASHED something you probably never do, spending your life on reddit eating cheetos. I can smell a Carmelo fan from miles away just like I can smell Carmelo's nasty beard. EW"
"Carmelo Anthony - Oh wait, I forgot, that bum has never even been a top 50 player in the league."
"Well I wonder why? We‚Äôre missing three starters and the defensive anchor that was Nurkic is injured. Not to mention Dame not being a good defender doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt try. He‚Äôs undersized and opponents bigger than him can get past him. Also, do you really think a starting lineup consisting of Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside and a bench of Hezonja, Gabriel, and Ant would be good on defense?"
"LeBron‚Äôs won the last 6 game 7‚Äôs he‚Äôs played, unless you‚Äôre taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He‚Äôs played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
I‚Äôm still having trouble with people meaning ‚ÄúLaMelo Ball‚Äù not ‚ÄúCarmelo Anthony‚Äù
"I‚Äôm just saying that this idea that having picks gaurentees success isn‚Äôt that true, the picks you guys have belong to really good teams so there‚Äôs no gaurentee you get a superstar like your making it out to be. Also let‚Äôs look at your player history, KD, Harden, Westbrook, Ibaka, Sabonis, Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, lu Dort (baby üêê) I don‚Äôt think your team or many other teams are ever gonna top having that much talent in a decade, I just realistically don‚Äôt think you having a shit ton of Clippers, Rockets picks is as big as a deal as you think it is. You guys had The Who‚Äôs who‚Äôs of 2010 all stars I don‚Äôt think your getting any better than that"
"What he did with triple doubles for what,3 years,was impressive but ultimately he‚Äôs a me,me,me player &amp; he won‚Äôt ever win a title as ‚Äúthe guy.‚Äù Could he win one as an aged player who gets traded to a title contender,sure. But does that really count? Like does Dwight Howard‚Äôs title really count when over a decade prior he was competing with LeBron for the East. Then as a guy who was barely in the league anymore,he joins LeBron and gets a ring. I feel like that‚Äôs Westbrook‚Äôs fate. Or he goes the way of Carmelo Anthony."
"Steph Curry and Carmelo Anthony.   NYK was a pick away, in D‚ÄôAntoni‚Äôs system, Curry would‚Äôve obviously THRIVED and been the PG instead of making Melo run Point-Forward.   This scenario likely adds a year or two to Melo‚Äôs prime. those seasons as the point-forward under Mike D and Woodie really took a toll on his knees and back.  The offensive combination of a prime Melo and Curry in a spread out system would have been unreal. especially with JR and Chandler. Knicks probably contend with the Heatles in the East with that pairing"
carmelo anthony with the 3-15 but team high +9 lol
Guess they never covered a Carmelo Anthony game.
"Who would have guessed that a team with 1 shooter, Paul George, would get demolished in the playoffs. I'm fine to admit that Westbrook's game isn't built for the playoffs where wins are earnt through exploiting your opponents weakness, not through your own strengths. I could make arguments about OKC playing bum ass Carmelo Anthony in the Utah series, or how the Jazz should've had about 10 more technical fouls in that series, or I could even point out the fact that both Russ and PG were playing through serious injuries vs Portland, but the biggest factor to OKC's and in turn Russ's playoff failures was a lack of shooting. As I said the playoffs are about exploiting weakness's in your opponent - having zero shooting is a pretty easy thing to exploit. As good of a GM Presto has shown himself to be, he clearly dosnt like giving up picks to go all in on a team, it was true in the KD era, was true in the Russ era, I hope it's not gonna be the case in the Cafe/SGA/Dort era."
Sounds exactly like Carmelo Anthony in New York type of situation.
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."

"which teams wanted that trade? i recall there being talks of paul george and carmelo anthony being traded to the cavs and it falling apart partly because they couldn‚Äôt find any team that wanted to trade for love, given his huge contract."
"Absolutely he averaged like 20 PPG early on and gave some Carmelo Anthony vibes, the injuries were a killer  Did you guys draft Okafor and Noel before or after Embiid? Wonder how that would have affected everything"
"What I meant was I respect Bens ability to get into the paint and handle himself through contact. People dumb as balls and dont understand thats the aspect I'm in awe of. Giannis has that same ability to finish strong and be athletic. I hate the 76ers and I hate Ben Simmons for being a liability as somebody that can't shoot the ball at all, even Shaq shot mid range and had to be marked there, but to denounce Bens basketball IQ is a travesty. Him being not able to shoot the jumper bc of whatever his left hand right hand issue is has nothing to do with IQ and ability.    Just like Lonzo. I've been a bit Lonzo fan for a long time because of his basketball IQ. He's smart and personally I love defense and transition creativity, which Lonzo finds himself being really good at. Dude sometimes looks like a modern day Dennis Rodman with his ability to create simply and his mindset of hounding for the ball and fishing for turnovers. I'm a defender at heart in soccer and ultimate Frisbee, having played with players that have gone pro that are semi pro played in D1 full ride d2 the entire spectrum of top ball in America and there's a difference in somebody who just knows to defend and somebody who just scores. You literally don't learn elite defense, you need to have been born with that mentality and an off beat timing to follow a play before it happens. As a defender in all sports, if you're on time you're late. I lost track of what I was talking about but defense is great great players see the game different. Comparing somebody like Kanter to any time Shaq is like comparing Thaddeus Young to younger Carmelo Anthony. Thaddeus decent player I like him but he's no Carmelo."
"Chris Paul/Iguodala, JJ Reddick/Carmelo Anthony,  Lebron/Trever Ariza, Paul Milsap/PJ Tucker, Marc Gasol/Haslem. Honestly still a title contender cause of Lebron and CP3. But there bodies would give up on them second roundish due to the insane workload at the old age."
"That's absolutely not true, and the case study is Wilt Chamberlain, Adrian Dantley, and Carmelo Anthony"
Carmelo Anthony in shambles
"loved watching Rockets Legend Clint Capela play alongside Rockets Legend Kyle Lowry, Rockets Legend Carmelo Anthony, and Rockets Legend Goran Dragic"
Can't spell Carmelo Anthony without Cole Anthony üòû
"This supports my theory that it‚Äôs cool to have ‚Äúhighlight real‚Äù players  But if you don‚Äôt have playmakers, and people who don‚Äôt stat pad, you‚Äôll win games  All this team is missing is Carmelo Anthony to drive this point home"
"Every I see their box score, I'm like Carmelo Anthony had a... Oh no, no, no, Cole it is"
"Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant are from/raised in Maryland. Carmelo was here from 8 years old through high school and Kevin was pretty much all his life until college.  Edit I'm dumb. Born != From. Fun fact Micheal Beasley, Jeff Green, Markell Fultz, and Chase Young are from Maryland too, the same county !"
"He might have been born in Brooklyn, but Carmelo Anthony is certainly one of (if not) the best to grow up in Baltimore."
He still lived in the DC area. Also Carmelo Anthony grew up in MD

"Giannis over Melo, I feel like more people know Giannis than Carmelo Anthony"
"Steph Curry  After those 2, it's open for debate.  It's either Durant, Zion, Carmelo Anthony, or Kyrie in my opinion."
"Listen, those were the days after Isiah Thomas completely ruined the Knicks, and they were desperate to put together the ""super team"" because of Miami. I remember vaguely that STAT and Melo were supposed to lure a third piece, might have been KD? Bringing in Stoudemire at the price they did was not a good decision, even worse in retrospect after he physically fell apart. All I'm saying is, let's not act like Carmelo Anthony was robbed, or something bigger than what he was. He had plenty of recognition and accommodations made for him."
Why would anyone talk about Carmelo Anthony in 2021

Are you fucking on crack? Melo is a hall of famer there is only one melo. Ball can go by LMB or something idk but melo will always refer to Carmelo Anthony
"People were so hard in LeBron for leaving in free agency but, when Carmelo Anthony essentially held the nuggets hostage, there was barely any backlash. This kind of behavior is the worst thing that happens in sports. I would say the media owes LeBron an apology but seeing as how he left the Heat and the media is all over his nuts again, I think he will be fine."
"Unless you‚Äôre extremely new to the NBA, Melo only means Carmelo Anthony"

The last block he had on anyone more than 5"" shorter than him was his last block in Golden State on Steph Curry."

"I remember the same thing happening at one of the past all-star games, in the early 2010s/late 2000s. Carmelo Anthony went for a layup instead of a dunk while on a fast break, wide open."
What about carmelo anthony? (I hope you see the pattern by now)
"""we're not waiving Carmelo Anthony"" - guy who waived Carmelo Anthony"
Carmelo Anthony
I think it‚Äôs because Allen Iverson and Carmelo Anthony wore the powder blue and it‚Äôs the last time I paid attention to the Nuggets before Jokic came along
"It's already shifted because newer fans won't have watched Carmelo Anthony. I think LaMelo taking on the nickname is fine because it'll be like passing the torch. Also, he has some star power and he pays homage to Carmelo Anthony when he does his signature three celebration."
"‚ÄúMelo‚Äù is Carmelo Anthony. Always has been, always will be."
I've always believed that Harden is the problem when it comes to chemistry. He's like Carmelo Anthony that way and the opposite of Perkins lol.
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"Idk man... I think that's being really kind to Melo the power forward defender right now if I'm being totally honest. He routinely gets cooked, is really slow getting out on shooters, except weirdly in the Bubble when I think he was in really good shape.   As a defender in space, he's so slow-footed and totally struggles to stay in front of his man. I also think he misses a lot of assignments and rotations during games. There were a number from last night's game, where he seemed to just totally forget OG in the corner and they got basically uncontested open 3's... happened on several occasions.   Frankly though, I think a lot of the blame lies with Stotts. Pairing Melo and Kanter is almost comical, and he continues to trot out that lineup out night after night, for long stretches of action. Its stupefying and so beyond the point of reason, that as a fan of this team you just have to accept it apparently.   The lineup we closed with last night, with RoCo as our smallball 5, and Melo at 4, fared much better. Similarly, pairing Kanter with one of RoCo or Derrick Jones, or even Harry Giles if Terry can find it in his heart to try and give him minutes to see what the hell we have with him, I think insulates Ennis a lot more from being completely exposed defensively. It's still not ever going to be pretty on that end, but that dude is a bucket down low and an incredible rebounder, as we all know. As everyone also has pointed out ad nausium, Nurk is fat as shit right now and is playing like total ass. He's a shadow of the player he was in 18/19, or even the bubble frankly, and while its worrying.. I think he gets himself in shape as the season goes on and will be back to his best. He's like my second favorite Blazer, so definitely pulling for him. Having Collins here as well, would really help us right now navigating our frontcourt challenges.   I just can't believe we're playing Melo 30+ minutes a game. It boggles my mind to be completely honest. I think a portion of it, is missing Collins as mentioned, and hopefully when (if) he ever comes back, we clean that up a bit... but for every game like last night where Melo gives us excellent bench minutes, hits big shots, has some feisty possessions on D... there's going to be like 4 others where he's going to pound the ball  incessantly, remove any limited flow that already barely exists within our offense, and fart up a ton of mid range jumpers while being a traffic cone on D. We love Melo... its a wonderful story and everyone on our team loves him. I just don't think when you're a team with aspirations to at least try and return to the WCF, you should be relying on a 38 year old Carmelo Anthony... but call me crazy."

Who the FUCK is Carmelo Anthony? I expected a LaMelo Ball highlight
"Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Enes Kanter.  That's half their rotation that are limited to seriously awful defenders.  Hard to get stops with those guys at the point of attack &amp; guarding the rim."
"Yeah it's a fair point I had thought that also and it might be what ends up happening. I just think for Hou there is also a level of urgency for this to happen regardless of what lip service is being given in this report, Harden's trade value getting him for 2 playoff runs vs 1 is a big difference. By trading for him you really are trading for him right now it's why the concerns about his next contract are overblown getting him is about now not about the right to give him $53 mil or whatever at age 36. The age thing is also why if you are a team I am trying to do this now the east in particular is wide open this season.   Best player to get traded in season recently was Jimmy Butler. Before that 2011 with Carmelo Anthony and Deron Williams. So yes what you are saying is true usually."
"The value of an NCAA championship and Olympic Gold medals should be absurdly lower than the value of things done in the NBA. Olympic Gold medals are almost won by default by the United States, having three of those means less to me than a Conference Finals appeareance. Unless you are from outside the US, an Olympic Gold Medal shouldn't determine whether you make it or not, Manu's one Medal means 10 times more than Melo's three.  Carmelo Anthony belongs in the Hall of Very Good, but he ain't a HoF if you are using Football/Baseball levels of demands. Imo, in a perfect world Melo is the exact example of a player that is just shy of making it, anything below him has no shot and anything above him makes it 100%."
"Maybe if you completely disregard that Carmelo Anthony won an NCAA championship and has 3* Olympic gold medals?   The basketball hall of fame celebrates a person's achievements throughout their basketball career, it's not a professional hall of fame in the sense that Canton is.   That being said, yes, still vastly more lenient on who gets in, but Carmelo Anthony is a poor example of that."
"The point is that a guy like Carmelo Anthony, for example, who will be a first ballot HoF without a doubt in the NBA, would either struggle for years or NEVER make it in the baseball HoF. The same thing happens in the Pro Football HoF, guys like Shannon Sharpe and T.O who were widely considered Top 3-5 in their positions at the time they retired had to wait multiple years.  You can tell me anything you want, guys like Melo, Lowry and Draymond Green would never make the HoF if the basketball HoF wasn't a joke, they are all very good, but they aren't Hall of Famers if Basketball used Football/Baseball levels of requirements.  As far as steroids go, i have a very similar thinking to Max Kellerman. If you were already a HoF at the moment you started using steroids (Barry  Bonds) you are in, if the cheating took you into a level that qualified you into the Hall, but you weren't before (Mark McGwire) you are out."

Fun fact: Carmelo Anthony was actually really good at basketball at one point in time. I also think you know what exactly what I mean anyway
Yes I‚Äôm sure superstar celebrity Carmelo Anthony has a hard time finding women
Pierce was a great player but it‚Äôs funny now that he‚Äôs considered someone overlooked by the younger generation.  If anything I think his legacy got a pretty lucky boost by the ‚Äò08 team and latter years. The first 10 years of his career he was basically Carmelo Anthony except he didn‚Äôt win anything in a way weaker conference.

"Harden and Lebron are the only ones I think you can definitevely say are better at dragging a team to the playoffs.    Our most common starting lineup last year was Dame, CJ, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan Whiteside, and either Trevor Ariza or Kent Bazemore and we had the 3rd best offense in the league"
"Been saying this. Complain about melo all you want, but when push comes to shove and you need one of your non stars to step up - we have Carmelo Anthony to do that"
"Carmelo Anthony is obviously good. Whether he's the best at his position, well."
"I think he's an over rated ball hog who's numbers were padded because he had to have the ball 90% of the time... And being the second greatest rocket of all time doesn't even say that much in my opinion. I'll admit when it comes to Harden, I'm a hater. I don't like the guys game at all. In my opinion he's a less likable carmelo anthony. No disrespect to his fans though. If you like him that's great. I was a huge Iverson fan and I know not everyone cared for him so"

"He could have a long time left in the league. Seems like the whole point of retiring a guy's uniform is that nobody else will wear that number after them.  Carmelo Anthony wore #15 for 7.5 years for the Denver Nuggets and *should* have had his jersey retired, but they waited and now Nikola Jokic has it.  I'm sure they can find a workaround for that (I'm guessing either Jokic changes numbers or gets grandfathered in), but the Rockets move makes things a lot cleaner."

"Carmelo Anthony is Melo. LaMelo Ball might get called that sometimes, but the nickname is officially occupied in the NBA by a far more accomplished player. Mellow Melo will just be more confusing because it just sounds like you're saying his name twice. Apparently Hornets fans are using Melon, which could work. There's no need to force these nicknames, just call him Lamelo until something actually sticks."
"Well the idea is ""think back to how you felt when Carmelo Anthony was a rookie"". Which is a fair thing to ask. The issue is that 0.2% of this sub was actually old/interested enough to watch the Nuggets play 17 years ago. Let alone to catch enough games to have an informed opinion on rookie Melo. At that point, the question's just going to hardcore Melo fans and hardcore Melo haters."

The disrespect lmao   Denver was a 17 win team and after drafting Carmelo Anthony they won 43 games and made the playoffs in the west. The second best player on that Denver team was Andre Miller. Haliburton is not the go to player on the Kings. LaMelo might win ROY but Charlotte isnt making the playoffs and thats in the East. As for numbers if we‚Äôre rounding.

Don‚Äôt let Carmelo Anthony see this
But four out of the last five postseasons he puts up that 30 points on 55% true shooting. The difference between the regular season number of 30 points on 62% true shooting and 30 points on 55% true shooting is that the first one as MVP level play in the second one is Carmelo Anthony volume scoring. You can make a pretty good statistical case for most of the last 5 years that the hard you get in the playoffs and the hard you get in the regular season are different players. He was very good the playoffs last year.
&gt; Productive in putting up empty stats on trash team fer sure. Dude's the literaly Carmelo Anthony of the football world.   Zlatan won the league almost everywhere he went. He didn't win Champions League though.   &gt; Dude's a cancer teammate too.   95+% of his teammates wouldn't agree with that.

Carmelo Anthony Davis Bertans would like a word
"That's not the argument at all.   &gt;Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  You're using a very generic TS% argument that doesn't actually apply. In the Durant/DJ comparison, both have positive efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a positive addition, therefore you want more of them.   Deandre Jordan = +12  Kevin Durant = +27  +27 &gt; + 12   In the Kyrie/Kemba comparison, both have negative efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a negative subtraction so you actually want less of them.   Kyrie Irving = -21  Kemba Walker = -17  -17 &gt; - 21  It's basic number line math. More negatives is not more good. A guy scoring poorly isn't helping you by scoring even more poorly.   Another example is Carmelo Anthony. Would you rather have Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a star or Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a role player?  At this point in his career, Carmelo Anthony trying to score 20ppg is detrimental to his team, he's better off scoring in a limited capacity and letting other guys take the shots instead.  &gt; so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans.  And for all intents and purposes, when Kyrie was sucking ass through a straw he tried to be the hero and got in everyone's way. When Kemba was sucking ass through a straw he let the Jays take over as the #1 and #2 options."

A large amount of players don‚Äôt take it seriously. Even if they do, then just because a guy plays in the NBA doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs good at analyzing it (look at how many former NBA players make terrible analysts).   Carmelo Anthony was 9th in player voting for the West frontcourt, with only 4 less votes than Rudy Gobert. Kostas Antetokounmpo got 10 player votes."

Like, my favorite player is Carmelo Anthony. No one thinks he's in the top 10 players of all time. If I think he is, I'm entitled to that opinion. But I'd be wrong to say he's critically considered a top 10 player."

"This is gonna get long but the deal would have been perfect if Oladipo was playing like his pre-injury self.  But the problem is that he isn‚Äôt.  So the Simmons deal was higher floor/ lower ceiling, while the Brooklyn deal was higher ceiling/ lower floor.  There are a few ways (most of which involve the Nets becoming bad) that the Brooklyn deal pays off:  1. The Brooklyn Nets‚Äô big three breakup and join new teams which can happen at the end of next season.  2.  Harden, KD, and Kyrie age horribly and cap out the Nets down the road  3. Brooklyn‚Äôs roster bottoms out due to injury   4. Some combination of all the above  5.  Houston uses those picks in future trades for star level players.  If any of those things happen this trade is a success, and whether or not it‚Äôs better than Simmons boils down to how high or low you are on him and who they eventually get in return alternatively.  Now it‚Äôs hard to speculate on these things.  The prevailing attitude seems to be that Harden, KD, and Kyrie will all age like fine wine, get along well and retire together in Brooklyn leaving all those picks to be in the 20s.  However even successful super teams can be short lived, and injuries can tank even the best of franchises-case in point Miami Heat with LeBron and the KD era Warriors.    But even if they get along well and even retire together, they will get older in years 2026 and 2027, Kyrie will be 34-35, Harden will be 36-37, and KD will be 37-38.  It‚Äôs difficult to say how good these players will be at those ages.  Just for perspective Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony are both 36 years old right now, while Dwight Howard and CP3 are both 35 years old.  DWade also retired at age 37 not too long ago.  So it‚Äôs very possible that by then Kyrie and Harden could be both be on bloated contracts and KD could be retired and still have no depth making for a very decent chance at at least two lottery selections there, although it‚Äôs tough to say how much carrying those guys will be capable of at that age.  So the best realistic case scenario for Houston is probably a combination of #2 and #5 where they trade most of those picks (excluding years 2026-2027) for young star caliber players (ie MPJ and or John Collins) while hitting big on their own picks and while still having 2 very valuable lottery selections in years 2026-2027  TLDR: We don‚Äôt know yet, it really depends on what happens with those picks/what Houston does with them. So time will tell"

"I will semi joking with that post. Personally I would go with the Rockets.  Hakeem with James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and TMac if we are going with primes"
"Jason Kidd, Carmelo Anthony and Rasheed Wallace.  Had a great 12-13 season with Knicks. If they were all in their primes this trio would've been fun to watch."
"Did you hear they named a highway after Carmelo Anthony?  It's the one with all the ""no passing"" signs on it.  Of course this works with any non-passing player.  I first heard it told with Dominique Wilkins."
I've been watching Carmelo Anthony since he was in high school. I think Melo is KD on steroids. Not just because of the difference in body type.    We would also have to factor in Kevin Garnett as well. Kd is a product of all of these playing styles.
He's a much better scorer than Carmelo Anthony ever was and also a significantly more complete player. He isn't an elite defender or playmaker but he's way better than Anthony on both fronts.

Ray Allen and Kevin Durant have the best looking jumpers. My personal favorite is Carmelo Anthony jumpshot.
"Tom Brady: lebron Patrick mahomes: trae young Lamar Jackson: Giannis  Aaron Donald: this could be lebron too, but there is no direct comparison Deshuan Watson: James harden, both really good, and both forced their way out of Houston  Aaron Rodgers: Kevin Durant, great but not better than the king Devante adams:idk Raheem mostart: deaaron fox Derrick Henry: Giannis/embiid Drew brees: Carmelo Anthony  Barry sanders:also Carmelo ig Jamarcus Russell: Anthony Bennett"
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"Okay this is easily the dumbest Reddit thread I have read today. You guys know you‚Äôre agreeing with each other right? Dame plays on ball because give him a high screen and some shooters, you got yourself a top 5 offense. Steph plays off ball more because he can shoot like 150% on threes and I‚Äôm pretty sure he releases the ball before it‚Äôs in his hands somehow, that‚Äôs how quick he is. Both would be good in the other‚Äôs role (Lillard would shoot higher than 38% if literally half of his threes weren‚Äôt unassisted step back fadeaways and Curry would average more assists if he handled the ball constantly like Dame does) but I don‚Äôt think either one does as well. Curry hasn‚Äôt played for significant time with Carmelo Anthony as his next best playmaker lol, and Lillard can‚Äôt shoot like Curry."
"Eh he played his whole career in a conference with Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant at the forward spot in the West. Kobe also ended up at SF starting a few times leaving only 1 forward spot.   Also, tbh, even though he is revered now, Dirk was never really a fan favorite outside of Dallas during his prime. Never sold that many Jerseys, also wasn't big on doing marketing for branding. So he was never one to rack up fan votes. Duncan wasn't big on those either but he had the championship pedigree."
"The Blazers roster around Dame for most of this season has been Robert Covington, Gary Trent, Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Jones, Anfernee Simons, Rodney Hood, and Harry Giles..."
"I'll take your example further! The Warriors make it to NBA Championship!!!  Wiggins turns 2013 POTENTIAL into a REALITY and becomes MAPLE JORDAN  Lakers try and sign Jabari ""Carmelo Anthony"" Parker to stop Wiggins but it's no use. They also sign Noah ""Chris Bosh"" Vonleh but he never leaves the bench."
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
"All NBA is for the best players.  All star is for the most popular, which correlates with the best obviously but it‚Äôs not about who‚Äôs best when a guy like Gobert is behind Carmelo anthony in fan ranking."
The Carmelo Anthony of his generation. Great volume scorer but the numbers don't indicate he was ever a really elite player
"Yup, he's actually why I said ""on a NBA roster"" and not ""play in the NBA.""  The other three are JJ Reddick, Andre Iguodala, and Carmelo Anthony."
Udonis Haslem (40)   Andre Iguodala (37)  Carmelo Anthony (36)  JJ Redick (36)  LeBron James (36)
"&gt; What if stars like Allen Iverson or Kobe Bryant played in an era that DID value efficiency?  One of these things is not like the other.  Kobe was consistently above average efficiency on huge volume throughout his career and was on numerous top offenses.  Iverson was consistently below average efficiency throughout his career and played on bottom 10 offenses for 3 out of the first 10 seasons of his career in Philadelphia.  Philadelphia's offenses got slightly better after he left, too.  You can quibble about whether the player or the coaching or the front office is to blame but Iverson provided much less value and impact than top players of generations before and after him.  &gt; We saw glimpses of that later on when Iverson went to Denver. Playing alongside another offensive threat in Carmelo Anthony, he had his most efficient season ever (56.7% true shooting.)  A more reasonable take would be that Iverson's efficiency increased as his usage dropped (his 26.7% USG that year was the lowest of his career to that point and a far cry from his mid-30% usage during his prime years in Philadephia."
If Melo keeps playing like this he could still break the top 10 maybe next season? If he averages like 14-16 until the end of the season he could go as high as 12th this season.   10.

I was thinking how come Lamelo had 0 assist but then realize you mean Carmelo Anthony.
"Closest comparison to more recent players would probably be Carmelo Anthony.   Both pure scorers who liked to operate in the midrange and post. Melo had a better handle, while Worthy was much faster and effective in transition. Neither was gonna make any All-Defense teams, but they could jump passing lanes for steals and were good enough not to be singled out on defense.   As far as fitting into today's league, it's hard to say. Obviously the NBA has moved away from that meta. You could play him like the Clippers do Kawhi, but I think Kawhi's a clearly better passer than Worthy or Melo."
One answer only - Carmelo Anthony.
"Carmelo Anthony, Ray Allen, Marc Gasol, Rajon Rondo."
"Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tony Parker, Manu Gibobili, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, Bob McAdoo, Dennis Rodman"
"This, along with most questions about the NBA/life, can be answered by the simple fact that Carmelo Anthony fans are really really annoying"

"Underrated:  * Royce O‚ÄôNeal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It‚Äôs like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
The last time the rockets and warriors played when both teams were competitive harden had:  * Carmelo Anthony * Clint Capela * Eric Gordon * Chris Paul * PJ Tucker  That's an interest cast of no help...
Carmelo Anthony won rookie of the month every month and didn‚Äôt get roty because LeBron did the same and roty is all nba and rotm is be conference.
"Lakers won 6 titles in 20 years lol. There was only a 5 year period where the Lakers were utter garbage. Then saved for no reason other than that LeBron decided to join an young roster and proceed to trade them all so his good buddy AD could leave his shitty small market team to join him.   As for the Knicks, they haven‚Äôt made the playoffs in 8 years, which is laughable, but they still managed to get Carmelo Anthony for no reason other than that he wanted to be in New York. Melo didn‚Äôt win anything obviously, but at least the Knicks had a marketable superstar for 7 years."
"Road Sixers don't blow teams out. Just please don't unleash Carmelo Anthony on us. I mean, I know he doesn't play for you guys but I just want to be sure."
"No players are hated on the Blazers roster atm, the one getting the worst of it weirdly being Carmelo Anthony.  He isn't allowed to have a bad game without a small number of fans demanding he be cut for being a ball-stopper.  Then, he scores 20+ 5 times in a row and we whip out the apology form in the sub lol"
Carmelo Anthony
"Percentage isn‚Äôt everything. If you take 500 shots and all of them are off balanced fad away 3s, you‚Äôd have a low percentage, but the reason why you take them is because you‚Äôre a good shooter.  Carmelo Anthony is an inefficient shot chucker but are you gonna say he‚Äôs a bad 3 pt shooter? Put him in a corner and ask him to solely take open corner 3s and he would be a GOAT shooter.  LaMelo is a good shooter with crazy range (pointed at logo and drained it when he was a kid), has mad handles since Chino, who has an iso game and scored 92 in a game. Just cause he shot poorly in NBL because he was the star and he tried to do too much, doesn‚Äôt make him a bad shooter. See how well he‚Äôs shooting now in his rookie year against the highest level competition when he just plays within his role?  In fact, the only thing that isn‚Äôt projected is his passing which seems to be on another level in the NBA. At Chino, he was taking alot of shots so his passing wasn‚Äôt on showcase unlike Lonzo. Melo has shown that he‚Äôs actually an even passer than Lonzo which is crazy."
Well Carmelo Anthony never won the rookie of the year so I guess you were wrong.
Dwayne Wade and Carmelo Anthony.
"All Carmelo Anthony shots are good shots, statistics need to find a new slant."
Carmelo Anthony is one now
Pretty disrespectful to Carmelo Anthony to act like Jeremy fucking Lin was the Knicks great hope

I don't like business decisions. I'm not a Carmelo Anthony fan.
"I don't even think it was a humbling. He shouldn't have been coming off the bench then and I don't think he was wrong. He has never been a bad teammate. He won the [Best Teammate award in New York for example](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/carmelo-anthony-best-teammate-knicks-players-article-1.3423741). Other stars like Kristaps loved playing with him. It was just really bad situations in all three places.  Really bad offenses run by selfish players in Houston and OKC and his time on the Knicks was due to a grudge from Phil Jackson and the front office. There's a reason why after he left there were still problems on those teams and CP got forced out, and KP and PG forced their own ways out  And I think he's a starter for some teams still IMO. He's obviously not the #1 scoring option anymore but he's a legitimate starting quality PF on a team where he's like the third best scorer playing. The Blazers are a great team who just always get hampered by injury."
"Oregon legend, Carmelo Anthony."
"Lamelo looks very promising, but there's almost zero chance he has the career Melo had. He just isn't as talented. Melo is, and always will be, Carmelo Anthony."
"&gt; All Defensive Teams First off, Kobe is the most overrated defensive player in NBA history  12 all-defense selections when he deserved maybe 4, in this era, where people arent voting purely off reputation, he doesn't get half of those.  &gt;BPM to say why Curry is at the top, lmao. Only Redditors, particularly Curry fans, would do so  Yes, lets use raw points, where Carmelo Anthony is going to finish ahead of Hakeem and Larry Bird.  You know who the all-time leaders in BPM are? Jordan and Lebron. Magic is third. VoRP isn't a bad way to look at things! Still, there are problems with using a box score metric--it overrates high usage/ball dominant players and underrates off-ball movement--though **these are not things that would make Steph look better than he was in comparison to Kobe**, who was the higher usage player. Steph beats Kobe in box metrics *despite* being less of a stat-padder.  Maybe box score metrics overrate super-heliocentric players like Harden or Westbrook. It's not the full picture, certainly. So, [if we instead look at RAPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm)-- which keeps only keeps track of how well your team performs when you're on the court vs off, adjusting to the average performance of your teammates--maybe Kobe does better vs Curry?   You gotta already know he doesn't, right?  Since RPM has been tracked (1997) there are 4 multiple-time leaders: Shaq lead the league 4 times, Duncan 3, Lebron 5, and Steph 4. Whatever noise exists in this stat, that's clearly a murderer's row. Kobe lead the league zero times. In Kobe's defense, if you limit RPM to only offensive impact, Kobe did lead the league in ORPM in 2006, also his best BPM season, when he scored 35ppg and carried a weak Lakers team.  Of course, *if we're gonna limit it to ORPM*, Steph becomes a god. Steph has lead the league in ORPM every full season he's played since 2014. That's 6 seasons in a row, and he's way ahead again in 2021 (The distance between Steph and #2, Dame, is roughly equal to the distance between Dame and #17, Jaylen Brown).   When we use advanced stats that don't rely purely on box score impact (accounting for off-ball movement) Steph becomes possibly the greatest offensive player of all-time.  I can also use PIPM, whatever you want, and Steph's peak will come out in a different tier than kobe's. **Kobe has incredible longevity, but he was not better than peak steph, and peak steph is still happening.**  &gt;including one (teammate) better than him for a while  Steph and KD are equals. Both around 13-16 ever.  Both have a chance to pass Kobe. Steph beat peak KD in the playoffs on a similar team. Do you think Kobe ever was even close to prime shaq?   Here are BPM comparisons for Steph and Durant since 2014: ||Steph|Durant| :-:|:-:|:-:| |2014|7.4|10.2| |2015|9.9|10.0 (27 games)| |2016|11.9|9.9| |2017|6.9|8.9| |2018|7.7|7.3| |2019|6.6|5.5| |2021|7.6|5.9| |Career|6.4|6.7|  Very even. Certainly the same tier of player. Kobe's career BPM? 4.6. Of course that does account for his decline. On the other hand, Kobe only had a higher BPM than Steph or Durant's *career average* twice in his entire career.  Here's Kobe and Shaq during the 3peat. ||Kobe|Shaq| :-:|:-:|:-:| |2000|5.1|9.3| |2001|4.8|7.7| |2002|4.6|8.0|  This is despite Shaq taking the regular seasons easy. Steph and Durant were equals. Kobe was a sidekick. When Kobe stopped being a sidekick, it was partially because Shaq declined, and the Lakers stopped winning titles.  Kobe still has two titles has the inarguable man to Steph's one, so, like I said: Steph needs 2-3 more MVP quality seasons (7+BPM) and one more title to pass Kobe"
Tobias Harris is like Carmelo Anthony except way worse
"Interesting that you bring up 2011 because I saw a good comparison of Dirk and Carmelo Anthony one time. That Melo at his peak was arguably a top 7 player or so, and the question was could he be the best player on a championship team? And they said similar to Dirk in 2011, he doesn‚Äôt just fit ANY team, but if a team were expertly crafted around Carmelo Anthony, The author said he could be  I think a similar fact about Damian Lillard is true. This current iteration of the blazers isn‚Äôt a title contender, but that isn‚Äôt his fault. He‚Äôs dealt with injuries the last two years to his team, and they‚Äôre still on a 48 win pace over an 82 game season.  If he had an elite defensive center and shooting, basically replace Mitchell on the Jazz with him, then that‚Äôs a title contender. Or if he had a great wing to run with who also was a good passer, someone like Jaylen Brown, then yeah.   I think he definitely could be the best player on a finals team. It‚Äôs just so hard to build that team."
You honestly have to realize /r/nba is just an echo chamber of people that browses more basketball-reference than watches actual games. Most people that grew up watching basketball and knows who Carmelo Anthony is appreciates him.
carmelo anthony is not an above average player anymore. lets be real.

"Where do the following players fit on your top 50 list then:   Dennis Rodman, Carmelo Anthony, James Worthy, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Vince Carter, Tony Parker, Dikembe Mutombo  The list goes on. I think Pierce not making a first team All-NBA is more of a product of him playing in the same era as other all-time greats such as KG, Tim Duncan, Dirk, Lebron, etc. than anything else."
"Man, people who dont watch the Timberwolves play at all and still bother to say these takes is ridiculous. Ant has a massive role which is carrying the offense, he has to take way more shots than the rest of the team due to them simply not being very good enough to score.  Its easy to be Haliburton and be the 3rd or 4th guy and you can average 10pts some dimes and that's it. Some of the most elite scorers in the NBA have been inefficient rookies and some even won ROY. Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, ect."
"Remember when they just came into the league and calling themselves ""Carmelo Anthony but with defense"" ? xD"
If Carmelo Anthony actually cared he could have been like LeBron.
"&gt;beating a stacked team USA with Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Amare Stoudemaire, Shawn Marion, Stephon Marbury, Dwayne Wade, Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Carlos Boozer, and Lamar Odom   Just for the record, Puerto Rico also beat down that team -- which was the worst Team USA in the professional era by a vast margin -- by 19 points.  Puerto Rico isn't even a country!  That PR team was Carlos Arroyo and a dozen guys who, but for their height, would not have looked out of place on your local playground court.  Spain was the only even half-decent team that couldn't beat that American squad.  Duncan's ""stacked"" Team USA was the biggest embarrassment in the country's basketball history."
Carmelo Anthony is top 20 all time
"&gt;Carmelo Anthony has won 21% of his playoff series, or 3 total series, in his career  wow, thanks for sharing, but where am I talking about his career? I said one season, his peak."
"Carmelo Anthony has won 21% of his playoff series, or 3 total series, in his career. That is not a superstar rofl."
"When they were contending with Melo and Melo became a free agent the Knicks were in every fuckin thing. I remember a Sports center opened and the hostesses went ""Carmelo Anthony, there I said it."" Lol"
"Not that difficult. Lillard has has an outstanding season, leading less a than stellar supporting cast to a good record, largely on the strength of clutch heroics. The Blazers have had to play Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, and Anfernee Simons for significant minutes this year. They are known defensive sieves. Lillard is not a great defender himself, so he just makes sure that his team scores more than the other. Now that they are getting more healthy, their defensive rating will go from historically bad to just bad, and their offensive will stay the same. Their net rating will improve, and they will climb slightly in the standings."
"Rookie scorers arent efficient, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Lebron James all were inefficient."
"I'm not really sure how good a defense a coach is realistically expected to generate with Dame, CJ, Robert Covington, Gary Trent Jr. Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter lead the team in minutes so far this season.   Some of that is on the coach for managing rotations, but a lot of that is injuries and personnel."
"Carmelo Anthony, people wanna act like he's still an offensive god but his shot selection is so bad and on nights he's off like tonight 0-7 FG it's painful to watch him post up into a fadeaway midrange"
"It's definitely gonna be enough lmao, Dame has to work through Jrue and Giannis and D while Giannis gets to dunk on Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony"
"He can go by whatever he wants, but Melo is Carmelo Anthony just like ""Kobe"" is Kobe Bryant and not some other guy named Kobe.  If you want to go by a single one name or nickname in Media and conversation, it goes to the more famous person. Yall in Charlotte can call him whatever you want, but for the rest of us Lamelo can maybeeee take that moniker in a few years."

Carmelo Anthony is a racist. Ask me why.
carmelo anthony
Carmelo Anthony is definitely up there. I'm biased but I'd say Jordan Poole is too.
carmelo anthony
"Carmelo Anthony, Kenyon Martin, Marcus Camby, Chris Andersen, 2010 1st round pick &amp; 2012 1st round pick"
Why the fuck is Carmelo Anthony getting 3 more shots than Norman Powell and 3 more minutes than DJJ.
"Breh. Isiah Thomas better be the Celtics one and not Zeke. Harden on here is fucking insane he's actually under rated. Jermaine O'Neal was a complete baller. And, who even rates Kevin Love this highly. The list should involve Carmelo Anthony, but I see your flair lmao."
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2). These 3 teams are considered by most to be in the range of ""fringe contenders"" to ""playoff lock but nothing more"". Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders. Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years:  * LeBron * Kawhi * KD * Kyrie * Blake Griffin * LaMarcus Aldridge * Serge Ibaka"
Knicks   PG: Walt Frazier (also best dressed of all time)  SG: Earl Monroe (nickname is black Jesus you‚Äôre in)  SF: Carmelo Anthony (all time hoodie game)  PF: Willis Reed (technically a C but come on it‚Äôs cap)  C: Patrick Ewing (duh)
So was Carmelo Anthony a superstar too?
I'd say prime Carmelo Anthony
"Reminds me ""hey I know lately a lot of you guys have been throwing shade at carmelo anthony"" -jeremy lin. These new york guys are stirring up some serious trouble"
"Nuggets with Allen Iverson, Chauncey Billups, Carmelo Anthony, Dikembe Mutombo, and Nikola Yokic would be pretty stacked if I remember correctly"
The NBA is not the WWE. From 1999 to now 4 teams have won 17 of those 21 championships. 1980 to  1998 you had 5 teams win 18 out of 19. The NBA has been a top heavy league with 2-4 true contenders for over 40 years.   A much better comparison is L√° Liga (Spain‚Äôs premier soccer league) where basically 2 teams traded championships for the past 20 years. It‚Äôs still thriving. Superteams don‚Äôt hurt ratings.   With that said. The original post was about restructuring buyouts to avoid them all going to the same team. Buyout guys get bought out for a reason. They are washed. Buy out players don‚Äôt win championships. They rarely ever even impact outcomes. Hell one of the best buyout outcomes in recent history is Carmelo Anthony and he didn‚Äôt exactly light Portland on fire.
"Player | Salary ---|--- Blake Griffin | $1,229,676 Duncan Robinson | $1,663,861 Carmelo Anthony | $2,564,753 Demarcus Cousins| $2,331,593 Devonte Graham | $1,663,861 Paul Milsap | $10,000,000"
"ESPN: Carmelo Anthony has rabies, how will this affect LeBron's legacy?"
Considering the alternatives are Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony as a small ball 5 I'd say it's impossible to overrate his importance for their defense \^\^
Imagine running defensive line-ups with Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter.  It's like asking a fat kid to watch the pie.
"That was like two weeks before he signed üòÇ. You know....once he had made up his mind. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.republicworld.com/amp/sports-news/basketball-news/carmelo-anthony-gave-up-basketball-before-trail-blazers-called-him-up.html  Why are you fighting this lol.  Blake and LMA are average to below average players, Drummond is average. These type of guys are bought out almost every year, they just aren‚Äôt as big of names.  Find another way to cope."
Carmelo is better than Anthony Davis because he has more All-Star appearances.
"&gt; We are the only team with a winning record and a negative point differential.   If you told our subreddit in December that Nurk and CJ would miss 55 combined games by the end of March and we'd still be ten games over .500, nobody would have cared what the point differential was. We're on a 50-win pace (for an 82 game season). You think coaching played no part at all in eking out win after win in close games?  &gt;We also have consistently one of if not the worst defense in the league.  We have a very good defensive big and a good defensive backup on the roster and both missed most/all of the season, and have ended up having to play Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony major minutes at the 4 and 5 instead . The last two seasons Nurk was healthy for we ranked 16th and 8th defensively. I don't see how this is on Stotts at all.   &gt; Dame and CJ are spectacular and carry out offense consistently   They don't do that despite Stotts. He knows what their strengths are and puts them in a position to succeed and the result has been an elite offense every year of his tenure here, Dame's rookie year being the sole exception (when the starting lineup was great but we had a historically unproductive bench). That's not some fluke.   Nurk back will hopefully add some more ball movement and consistency to the offense, at any rate."
Is Carmelo Anthony the 2nd best defender on the court right now for Portland
"&gt;How many superstars are gonna stick it out in fucking Charlotte? Or Cleveland. Now how many LA Superstars have left LA (before their careers were virtually over)?  O'Neal left Los Angeles -- not by choice, but had he not, Bryant would've, so that's one either way.  Chris Paul went to and from LA.  Dwight Howard went to and from LA.  Not that many superstars actually change teams before age 30.  Leonard did it twice.  James did it once.  Chris Paul did it once.  Durant did it once.  Davis did it once -- if he's in that class.  Carmelo Anthony did it once.  Dwight Howard did it twice.  O'Neal did it once.  That's about it, going back 20 years, and most of those were trades, and some quite expensive.  Maybe not in Charlotte, but Westbrook, Lilliard, Curry, Thompson, Antetokounmpo, Gobert, Simmons, Embiid, Beal, and others appear to be ""sticking it out"" in non-LA/NY markets.  Gasol stuck it out in Memphis.    &gt; Guys like Horford and Redick are sought after, but they aren't the marquee players that are like ""LA or bust.   No, they aren't, but Erving and Malone were.  Erving even left his hometown for Philly -- the Knicks made an offer, but the 76ers outbid them.  &gt;Any city outside those 3 needs to pray for a generational talent to fall in their laps and try to build up a roster around them.   You don't need a ""generational talent"" to win a ring, and you sure as hell don't need one to be competitive.  Miami doesn't have a generational talent, and went to G6.  Toronto didn't have a generational talent, and won a ring.  San Antonio did not have a generational talent in 2014, and won a ring.    &gt;You're not getting a generational talent if your team can consistently get the 7 or 8 seed.   You have to pick one here.  Either you use ""generational talent"" properly and it refers to LeBron James only, or you mean something else, in which case you have to include players like Antetokounmpo.  And he was precisely available to such a team -- Milwaukee went 38-44 and got swept by the Heat in the first round, and subsequently drafted their 2-time MVP.  Denver went 36-46, then drafted their franchise Serbian."
Tobias has fully embraced his fate as the B- version of Carmelo Anthony
Yea when you bang your teammates wife it‚Äôs def going to effect your team. Or when you air out private info about someone cheating on their girl it‚Äôs gunna effect the team. Yea I mentioned 3 cases where it directly effected team chemistry because it had to do with your team. Did Carmelo Anthony fucking a stripper ruin team chemistry? Paul George cheated on doc rivers daughter and they still seemed okay with each other. Cheating doesn‚Äôt matter for NBA guys unless it effects the team bond
Paul Millsap is not a solid role player this year. Jamychal Green has missed a lot of games. And Will Barton is pretty much putting up the same stats as Carmelo Anthony but we're forced to start him.
Fun Game: Find Carmelo Anthony and try to explain what he was doing there.
reminder that the Blazers were able to get Carmelo Anthony for two strings and a couple of bees.
Carmelo Anthony has this smoothness to his play I think it‚Äôs all just personal style
"Portland never gets brought up when talking about contenders, but we‚Äôre 22-16 with Dame basically going down in a hail of gunfire every night because a washed Carmelo Anthony is our 2nd best player.  (I fucking love Melo, but still)"
Carmelo Anthony üî•
"Carmelo Anthony, the man splashes everything BUT technical free throws"
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
it's worse that this highlight literally has Carmelo Anthony in it
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
It always confuses the hell out of me when people refer to LaMelo Ball as ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù because I always associate that nickname with Carmelo Anthony. And then you had to go and use it on an actual post involving Carmelo. C‚Äômon man! Making me think too much
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
"Win today? Not exactly sure, but I think if it was everyone at the peak of their career, team B. Carmelo Anthony could score buckets. Embiid is dunking on Horford no matter when in his career."
"Bruh Carmelo Anthony was out of the league just year ago and he still be droppin 30s, there is very very small margin of error in the NBA"
"They could've had a better back up plan. I know they were going for Giannis but even that was a long shot. They could have moved players like Powell or Lowry who'll they'll now have to rush to move or get nothing back when they'll walk. Or in Powell's case are going to have to give up a ton of cap space for a sixth man.  At least when the Celtics lost Kyrie, they picked up Kemba immediately. The Pelicans only moved Anthony Davis once they were guaranteed Zion. Even the Thunder got Paul George and Carmelo a season after Durant left. The Raptors have done nothing but lose their championship identity each season with no replacement even for their role players."
"Guy I get you love LaMelo. That's fine. Carmelo is a legend, LaMelo is a baby. When NBA fans think of Melo, they think of Anthony. The next generation of fans may think of LaMelo if he has a great career, but you're comparing a moderately promising rookie to a guy who will be in the top 10 all time in scoring. You have to realize what's happening here"
"&gt; Likewise, if you watched US basketball, they'd likely have lost to Spain one of those years without Melo.  Melo had 28 points on 10/31 FG in US's three straight encounters against Spain from 2008-2016, hardly inreplaceable.  &gt; Basically I think it's silly to say ""you're so good at basketball that your titles don't count.""  They count, but if actually read my original comment you would see that i specifically say that they shouldn't be a difference maker between him making the HoF or not.  My point is simple, if Carmelo Anthony didn't exist the US win all of those games, that shows how much value his Gold Medals should have and for that matter how much value the Gold Medal of any US born player has.  They win by default, it has gotten to the point where talks about sending college kids started after the 2016 Olympics, it's simply completely unfair."
Because Carmelo Anthony said he is cool with it? Or it being his name?
"And that's what [Carmelo himself](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/blazers-carmelo-anthony-says-the-reasons-he-went-unsigned-for-so-long-were-outside-of-basketball/) said was the issue.   GMs didn't know if he was going to be OKC Carmelo, who was a massive headache. And the Houston run was only 10 games, so it's not like teams had a better idea on where his headspace was at."
"The point is that if Carmelo Anthony wasn't born, the US still would've won. Regardless of what you think about Melo, he wasn't the difference between the US winning and losing.  It would be as if Kawhi and Giannis joined the Nets next season and they started Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, KD and Giannis, you would 1000% give 0 value to their rings."
Ohhh Carmelo Anthony!   I thought for a sec it was Lamelo Ball when I read it like damn that was quick

"No they aren't, for an American born player a Gold Medal means less than an All-Star appeareance. Carmelo Anthony could've been a doctor and the US would've won their Golds without him, they have 15 out of 18 Gold Medals in the Olympics.  The United States wins Olympic Golds in Basketball by default and they will always do so, they've done it before Melo and will do it long after Melo is gone."
"He has three and i know they count, but honestly Olympic Golds for American born players should 1000% not be a difference maker between making the Hall and not making it.  The US has won Gold Medals every year since they got NBA players to go to the Olympics, the only exception was the 2004 fiasco. If Carmelo Anthony had decided to be a doctor and not a basketball player, the United States would've still won gold in 2008, 2012 and 2016.  Melo is a HoFer regardless of his Olympic Golds and if he wasn't they shouldn't be a factor."
"Here's a glance of the NBA all-time scoring list:  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387)  Karl Malone (36,928)  LeBron James (34,792)  Kobe Bryant (33,643)  Michael Jordan (32,292)  Dirk Nowitzki (31,560)  Wilt Chamberlain (31,419)  Shaquille O'Neal (28,596)  Moses Malone (27,409)  Elvin Hayes (27,313)  Carmelo Anthony (26,947+)  Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946)  Oscar Robertson (26,710)  Dominique Wilkins (26,668)  Congrats to Melo!"
Agreed.  Carmelo anthony doesn't have a monopoly on it
"‚ÄúThe Banana Boat Team, Banana Boat Squad or Banana Boat Crew is a hypothetical pop culture NBA superteam, consisting of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul.‚Äù  However, looking at the pictures, you‚Äôre right. Melo was on the same vacation though"
" &gt;Literally the most famous man outside of Carmelo Anthony that is heavily associated with your business.  Your business? A random security guard that doesnt exclusively work for MSG suddenly needs to know the famous people for the venue they are working that night? Lmao this dumbass.   ""Oh but his pictures!"" Again, the rando security guard probably doesnt give a shit about basketball or msg to be looking at every decoration and frame around. Guy probably wants to do his job in peace and go home.  There are very few athletes in the world that would get recognized by anyone. Ewing aint one of those."
"A remember reading a column from around 2012, maybe a bit later, about Carmelo Anthony. At one point the writer mentions a YouTube video of Melo, AI, Camby, DerMarr Johnson and some other players being piss drunk outside of some night club in Denver doing stupid things.  To this day I have never managed to find that video."
Why are you reaching so hard to prove that that‚Äôs a reasonable level ignorance to have of the place you work. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs some random bench scrub rolling up. Literally the most famous man outside of Carmelo Anthony that is heavily associated with your business. Not saying they‚Äôre bad people but they obviously fucked up. Imagine if some shmucks tried to accost Kobe in staples? They‚Äôd be chased out.
Point: Russel Westbrook SG: Devin Booker SF: Carmelo Anthony  PF: Domantas Sabonis Center: Nikola Jokic
"The NBA said Booker, at 24 years and 132 days, is the eighth youngest player in history to reach 100 games with 30 or more points. The only younger players were LeBron James - who was day shy of his 22nd birthday when he reached the milestone - along with Kevin Durant, Bob McAdoo, Carmelo Anthony, Oscar Robertson, Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan."
Carmelo Anthony from Ned's Declassified
Can‚Äôt win with those cats.   ~~Kevin Durant~~ Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo ‚Äú[Imhotep](https://www.google.com/search?q=imhotep+cat+gif&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00lcgQyQqjOMwZ32PTdQdMGEC2K0Q:1615495498633&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh1dPajanvAhXMKM0KHXroBhQQ_AUoAXoECA4QAQ&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=715#imgrc=MzRr9Ww_bGZZmM)‚Äù Anthony
Carmelo Anthony is a 2-time All-NBA 2nd Team performer and a 4-time All-NBA 3rd Team performer. 10 time All-Star. Won a scoring title.  Reggie Miller was a 3-Time All-NBA 3rd Team performer and 5 time All-Star.  I would venture to guess there are many in this thread who somehow think Reggie ranks above Melo.
&gt; 20. Carmelo Anthony is afraid of cats.  Is this a fact or just an archived KD tweet?
 20. Carmelo Anthony is afraid of cats.   And still he proceeded to score his career high against the Bobcats in 2014: 62 PTS.
Damian Lillard? Carmelo Anthony?
"I became a Nuggets/ Carmelo Anthony fan because of Ned‚Äôs declassified lmao. That episode that Ned finds Melo‚Äôs shoes in the lost and found.  So I started watching more basketball because of that, and the Nuggets. Melo was already my fav player. However a defining moment that sold me on Melo was when he was going head to head against Lebron in 2010 and he hit a game winner over him in OT"
&gt; Carmelo Anthony (3--why not 2?!?!)      Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
"The only issue I have with this is it focuses too narrowly on an individual. When the team is what really matters.  Perfect example: Kyrie. Maybe Kyrie makes this list on his own. But we‚Äôll never know because LeBron came back. And it‚Äôs like...maybe that counts, as Kyrie was a talented enough player to lure LeBron back. But without LeBron the odds of those Cavs teams doing anything was pretty slim.  Then look at Carmelo. In 04-05, he was the top scorer, but had the lowest Win Share of the starters and worst Vorp. He was at .5 compared to 2.6 (Camby), 2.0 (Miller), 1.8 (Martin), and 1.7 (Boykins). Even 34 year old Byron Russell had a higher Vorp (.7)  Obviously Melo being there let the other guys thrive. I doubt if you take him out the team is suddenly stronger. But it wasn‚Äôt just drafting Melo that made the difference.   I think that‚Äôs the case with most of these guys. The odds of a lottery pick = playoffs has more to do with the rest of the team than the pick. There‚Äôs probably a world where Brandon Ingram ends up with Embiid in Philly and is on this list while Simmons gets Luke Walton‚Äôd then traded for Anthony Davis.   I think circumstances matter more than this analysis allows for."
"Ur fucking stupid if u think James Harden is even comparable to Carmelo Anthony lmao. Also I see u are still pedaling the braindead ""Harden is a selfish ball hog"" narrative so I can only assume ur a casual that only watches Harden highlights but still completely ignore the fact that he played like that because he had to. Look at what he's doing in Brooklyn"
"Me too, then I think about Carmelo Anthony calling him ‚ÄúJimmy‚Äù and laugh even more  https://nypost.com/2016/02/21/carmelo-doesnt-seem-jacked-about-jimmer-fredette/"
"I never liked Dwight Howard.    I never liked Carmelo Anthony.   I already respected Chris Paul.     I wasn't too familiar with John Wall, but he seems dedicated."
Old Russ was historically great though . Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not just normal great now . A good player is like Carmelo Anthony or something imo
"Oh yes 36 year old Carmelo Anthony or Gary Trent is better than Dame, or are u referring to the ones that played 13 games?"
"LeBron James: No years at college.   Kevin Durant: One and done.   Anthony Davis: One and done.   Carmelo Anthony: One and done.   &amp;#x200B;  Works both ways, really."
Would a combination of LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony be better than the total package that is Lebron James
"Do OKC fans regret drafting Harden over Steph? Or Clippers fans regret drafting Blake over two top 25 all time players? I don't think so. In the end, there's only so much you can do when scouting talent and developing players. Had Lebron never left the Cavs and Denver somehow got into their streak of drafting amazing players with mid 1st round and 2nd round picks a few years earlier, we could be discussing how letting *""3 time MVP, 5 time finals MVP Carmelo Anthony""* fall to 3rd was a huge mistake for Detroit, but Cleveland wouldn't exactly be laughed at hysterically for picking a multiple time MVP in James themselves."

Love to see MVP Carmelo Anthony
2013 Carmelo Anthony üò≠üò≠üò≠
"2013	Carmelo Anthony   2014	Blake Griffin  That would be, in retrospect, a pretty sad run of MVPs. It would certainly vastly change the narrative of either player if they had won one, though. Blake especially, I think."
Carmelo Anthony winning MVP puts a smile on my face.
"I was with you until Carmelo won in 2013.  He had 1 first place vote. Durant already won, Chris Paul already won, Tony Parker already won, Tim Duncan already won.  I'd give the nod to James Harden that year, bumping Melo out.  Then 2018 becomes Anthony Davis."
Carmelo Anthony is a member of a racist Nation of Islam offshoot group called the 5 percent Nation...just fyi
Sometimes I am watching and just smile at how dope it is that Carmelo Anthony is a Blazer
Chris Bosh adds way more to a team than Carmelo Anthony ever did. Bosh  playing center with his skill set was much more valuable than anything Carmelo did.
Ben ‚ÄúCarmelo Anthony‚Äù Simmon
"""Carmelo Anthony has a fun late career run with the Trailblazers"" is not something I, or I suspect anyone else, would have predicted a few years ago."
"LaMelo  Ball does not get to have the Melo nickname, yet. Melo belongs to Carmelo Anthony."
"Our GM straight up said that. Lol  &gt;Neil Olshey on Carmelo Anthony: ""We've kind of become the custodians of his legacy. He's going to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer ... the longer he stays in Portland, the more we're associated with his legacy."""
Rockets legend Carmelo Anthony
"I think that's overstating it a bit for the Eastern Conference. Definitely more true in the West at that time though.  -  Eastern Conference centers in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Joakim Noah * Miami: Joel Anthony * Boston: Jermaine O'Neal * Orlando: Dwight Howard * Atlanta: Al Horford * New York: Amare Stoudemire * Philadelphia: Elton Brand * Indiana: Roy Hibbert  -  Eastern Conference small forward in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Luol Deng  * Miami: LeBron James * Boston: Paul Pierce * Orlando: Hedo Turkoglu * Atlanta: Josh Smith * New York: Carmelo Anthony * Philadelphia: Andre Iguodala * Indiana: Danny Granger  -  The centers are hit-or-miss, but the SFs are absolutely stacked."
"Oh for sure  This is all why I don‚Äôt find the ‚Äúif x player played in y era‚Äù (it‚Äôs usually LeBron in the 90s, these days) arguments very compelling.  If we‚Äôre gonna boil things down to ‚Äúbut this player is the GOAT cause he played in a more advanced world‚Äù then we might as well not crown a GOAT cause no one who we‚Äôve seen on the court could ever compare to Carmelo Anthony VII, who will play against 8‚Äô cyborg shooting guards who can dunk from half court"
Bosh was never worth a max-contract. It‚Äôs primarily one of the reasons why Colangelo decided to let him walk in free-agency. He isn‚Äôt in the same tier as a LeBron or Carmelo Anthony.
"I was a Knicks fan as a child, however I barely followed the NBA, so you could say I was a fan just because I lived there. I did know however, that the Knicks weren't great. They had spurts during my life(born in 1994 during the first finals run and remember the 1999 run too), but even then I knew they were flukes. My first Knicks game with family (David Lee years) reinforced this, as I remember it being a blowout and leaving early.  Fast forward to 2010; this was the first year I chose on my own to start following basketball and what a year that was. LeBron joins the Heat and basketball is much more popular in our area. The Knicks also seemed to bolster their roster and *seem* like they're making good decisions. From what I remember the top 3 talked about teams on the East were the Heat, Chicago, and Boston (more on them later), but the Knicks were a feel good story. Everything was looking up until mid season.  The Carmelo Anthony trade was what initially put me off from the Knicks. Not because of *him*, but the timing was awful. The amount the Knicks gave up for him was ridiculous. This season, while a success, is a result from the ripple effects of that trade.   I barely knew the NBA but knew that was a shit trade just by the player count. Him and Chauncey Billups for almost their entire core. *They could have literally signed him outright had they waited until the end of the season.*  During the season, while following the Knicks and the Heat because the media won't shut up about them, I was also looking at the Celtics. They were also trying to bounce back from their finals run and always liked how they presented themselves. Yeah they can come off as stuck up but that comes from the rich history. As a Knick fan that year losing to the C's felt more impactful and powerful than losing to the Heat. They would end up playing in the first round that year and the Celtics generously swept them. I followed them ever since.  Sorry Knick fans you can ridicule me as much as you want I've gone through it for years. But I'm happy to see they're playing well this year and hope they continue to improve."
Carmelo Anthony.
"Carmelo Anthony  Future: Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Bradley Beal üëÄ"
"**Carmelo Anthony**  Denver isn‚Äôt going to retire his jersey, Jokic already has it   If the Knicks find success in the coming years, then Melo‚Äôs time in NY won‚Äôt look as good and they won‚Äôt retire it   OKC, Houston and Portland aren‚Äôt going to retire it  Warriors already said they‚Äôre retiring KD‚Äôs jersey. Kawhi‚Äôs going to get his retired too, he just won‚Äôt be the first one."
Right but Westbrook lost in the first round with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony against a rookie in Donovan Mitchell who was sitting classes 10 months in school 10 months earlier
"50% of LeBron coming to the Lakers probably does have to do with LA but the other 50% has to do with Magic and Rob convincing him. There is no way LeBron comes to the Lakers if Jim Dumbass Buss and Mitch Kupchak were still running shit. From 2013-2016 they struck out on every big name free agent (Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron who they were going after in 2014, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and Kevin Durant didn't even wanna give them a meeting in 2016). Magic and Rob changed the FO culture and just in time too or else we wouldn't have LeBron and AD"
Nah he's talking about noted defensive stopper Carmelo Anthony.
"Says you. OKC until this season was consistently a playoff team and overachieved expectations from the beginning. And has a relationship with their city that not many teams have. Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Derek Fisher, Victor Oladipo are just some of the names that have complimented the atmosphere with the team and how professional Presti is with them."
"The Thunders would be really good.   Ep 1: Okla-Home-A: the Thunder is born and the team comes to OKC for the first time with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in tow. Shows some background on what happened with Seattle  Ep. 2: The Thunder Rolls: Drafting Harden, and covers the challenge to LA in 2010, taking Dallas to the WCF, and going to the Finals in 2012.   Ep 3: When it Rains, it Pours: Covers the Harden trade post 2012 Finals, the Westbrook injury in 2013, and the tough 2015 season.   Ep 4: You the Real MVP: Covers Durant‚Äôs 2014 MVP season and his impact on the city.   Ep 5: New Beginnings: Covers the hire of Billy Donovan and the departure of Kevin Durant in 2016  Ep 6: The Brodie: Episode goes in-depth on Russell Westbrook‚Äôs relationship with the city and organization. Also covers his 2017 MVP Year  Ep 7: OK3: Covers the trades for Paul George and Carmelo Anthony and their season together in OKC  Ep 8: Shockwaves: Covers the Paul George extension, the failed 2019 season, and the trades of Westbrook/George to begin the new era.   Ep: 9: Restructuring: Covers the return of Chris Paul to OKC and his impact. Also covers to arrival of Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Lu Dort, Darius Bazley, and the teams new direction.   Ep 10: A New Storm: Mark Daigneault is hired as the new coach, the team begins its process of tanking to draft in the lottery, and begin their race back to where they once were, trying to bring the organization back full circle where they were a decade ago. Could possibly feature: Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley, or Jonathan Kuminga"
Clearly they are the favorites and scoring every time no question. My only thought is that Harden would only try on offense‚Äî and a good two way team (like Carmelo Anthony Davis) might be able to put up a good fight. Or Bill Russell Westbrook.
‚ÄúHow would you improve the team if you were the GM‚Äù im sorry carmelo anthony isnt good anymore. Dont hate me bc youre in denial about your team.
\*  here a bunch of great players with a negative playoffs record:  Carmelo Anthony: 3-12  T-Mac: 3-9  Dominique Wilkins: 3-10  Vince Carter: 6-11  Allen Iverson: 6-8  Charles Barkley: 12-13  Dirk Nowitzki: 13-14 (and yet that 2011 title worth more than many of the titles in NBA history)
"Important?? Important if they want to loose! Man did you watch basketball? Russ is statpadding more than ever, with all of his TOs you can pile up the mount Everest, and his shooting, oh boy his shooting is so shitty that if you let an AVERAGE NBA player take the same ammount of shots Russ take he will score +130 points for the Wizards with respect of what Russ did, that's the definition of UNPLAYABLE. If you have Russell Westbrook you know that you will give up a shit tons of points, how can you win like that? Not considering all defensive metrics, impact metricrics, +/-, Net plus/minus, On/off Stats, it all says that Russell Westbrook nowadays is a rather mediocre player that just pile up empty stats at best, playing shitty defense and bad offense forcing your team to feed him.  Not considering Russ historically plays even worst in the playoff, he had 32 going for 33, he had one of the biggest contract of the NBA still. If Beal turns the back to him (which I highly expect, if not I will expect the Wizards will rather let this shitty team explode rather to play their way into mediocrity) it will be the 4th star to do so in 5 years. You won't see him playing the 6th man role because he has such a big ego he couldn't even accept to be the 3rd wheel in a team. He can't play off the ball and he never had 1 single improvement in his games in 10 years now. That are all sings to me that he will be our of the league soon.   He is playing the reminiscent of NY Carmelo Anthony or last year Denver/Detroit Allen Iverson. Melo had a way bigger bag of basketball knowledge and could actually reinvent himself, with all his flaws, as a role player, I hardly imagine Russ did so."
Rookie Carmelo Anthony was worth more than that for the Nuggets all those years ago
Carmelo Anthony up there on list with him
"&gt;but apparently we have to temper that by specifically mentioning ""for his time"" or some shit.  Yes, you do. Unless you're suggesting that Bradley Beal (31.1 ppg) is a better scorer than prime Shaq (29.7 ppg), Carmelo Anthony (28.9 ppg) and Vince Carter (27.6 ppg), and is on the same level as prime Allen Iverson (31.4 ppg), LeBron James (31.4 ppg), and Karl Malone (31.0 ppg).  This isn't randomly taking away stats from old players, this is noting the irrefutable fact that the game has changed throughout the years and that changes in pace and rules can inflate or deflate stats. Old numbers that look impossible to replicate in the modern game are probably the result of the game being much different back then more than they are the result of basketball demigods descending upon the earth to play basketball at a level so far above even the greatest modern players that the comparison is laughable."
"Stars leave to join with other stars. If they were leaving one bad team for another, it wouldn't be worth moving in the first place. Somehow Carmelo Anthony and Paul George didn't go to the finals after joining up with Westbrook, CP3 didn't go to the finals after joining up with Harden, PG13 didn't go to the finals after joining up with Kawhi and every single one of the Timberwolves defectors did."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
Carmelo Anthony at the Blazers.

Like the Knicks with Carmelo Anthony
"Type of dude to drive right and put it up with his left hand. Or attempt outlet passes deep underneath the hoop time and time and again when the passing lane is nowhere to be found. I mean, I don‚Äôt necessary find all of these things too troubling with him in the sense that, I‚Äôve never perceived him to round out much more than a 2b or six man so to speak caliber player... a lazy comparison would be Andre Iguodala (though I‚Äôm not really altogether comparing their games, just that sort of potential utility to a championship caliber team type player. Which, may be a bit too flattering for him if I‚Äôm to be honest, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt read the tea leaves altogether for him, though my suspicion is that he simply doesn‚Äôt have all the cards in the deck to put things together all that much beyond what we‚Äôve seen of his skills thus far. But he‚Äôs young, and he‚Äôs got an incredible build, and most importantly, the kid is super humble and won‚Äôt let his ego get in the way of team contribution. I don‚Äôt get the feeling for instance, that say were Randle to have not exerted his clear top dawg position within the team this year, he would be making it a point to make sure he did so himself. Not even sure where I‚Äôm going with all this tbh, just that the kid‚Äôs honestly grown on me and he‚Äôll always catch daps for that ‚Äúyooo I‚Äôm a knick‚Äù shit alone. Shit, I would have been like, ‚Äúfuck I‚Äôm a knick...‚Äù. In the end, like I said, I won‚Äôt profess to read the teas with his future, but if he can in any small way become even a shade of that Iguodala eschelon + added caliber player, that‚Äôs a big win. League can always do with more or them folk - less of the Carmelo Anthony types. One type of player contributes to something bigger, the other don‚Äôt."
Team USA should reserve a roster spot for Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony has won 3 playoff series in his career
"For a long time agents and players from the CAA ran and continue to run the Knicks organization &amp; roster  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/03/10/report-knicks-player-says-teams-caa-clients-get-preferential-treatment/  then finally dolan formally hired one of the leading CAA agents ([not coincidentally the agent that represented Carmelo Anthony](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2875592-im-still-in-shock-nobody-knows-knicks-new-boss-like-carmelo-anthony) and completely fleeced the Knicks) to officially run the team  [they got a CAA coach, and even made Woodson fire his agent to get a CAA agent](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2013/12/12/tom-thibodeau-to-the-knicks-well/)  Leon's been working out so far but the complete takeover of a franchise from within by a sports agency is one of the most baffling things I've heard of in this sport, and it basically went completely swept under the rug"
&gt; KD is like the ultimate version of Carmelo Anthony.   Hot take but you make a fair point. He has yet to prove himself without a historically stacked team at his back
"Ahhh good point, that really does elevate Melo's case well above Ben's, as he also has the NCAA chip.   I think both should absolutely make the hall. I guess a better post would be ""Ben Wallace had just as good of an NBA career as Carmelo Anthony."" Which I still think is true, the gap in impact between Ben's defense and Melo's offense is much larger than the gap between Ben's offense and Melo's defense."
Why do they all say Carmelo Anthony 2016 in bold instead of player and year? Lol
"Yeah he's only played with KD, Harden, Paul George, Bradley Beal, Carmelo Anthony, Oladipo, Sabonis, Ibaka, Derek Fisher and who knows however many other all time greats"
"&gt; still playing the position.  Again, this even further the point. He's a passing SF who controls the ball, I'm not denying that, but he's not a Point Guard, he was not playing the position and he especially wasn't viewed that way.   2016 for example, here were the East Starters:   - Dwayne Wade - Kyle Lowry  - Lebron James - Paul George  - Carmelo Anthony   There are two people on that list far more qualified to be labelled a Point Guard then Lebron. And it's ridiculous to act like that's not obvious.   Just because Lebron passes, does not mean he's a point guard in comparison to the leagues *actual point guards*. He's a Small Forward whose a great passer."

Has LaMelo Ball taken the title of ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù from Carmelo Anthony this quickly??
"He‚Äôs at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He‚Äôs at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He‚Äôs at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn‚Äôt worth anything close to what he‚Äôs making. He‚Äôs turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don‚Äôt make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."

"Good lord this guy is the most overrated player since Carmelo Anthony. I‚Äôve never seen a dude averaging 5 turnovers a game on 50% TS get this much praise on a 10 seed in this pathetic East. Outplayed by rookie Donovan Mitchell, outplayed by Dame, then shits the bed against the Lakers and nearly lost the series for the Rockets against OKC. Only one season after being traded away for one of the greatest PGs of all time + 2 FRP+ 2 pick swaps, he gets traded for a washed Wall with a horrible contract and 1 2023 lottery protected pick. When it‚Äôs all said and done he won‚Äôt even be top 10"

Idk why I‚Äôm surprised that Deandre can‚Äôt box out 36 year old Carmelo Anthony
White chocolate  Allen iverson   Carmelo Anthony  Steve Nash   Vince carter
Are you seriously calling 06 Carmelo Anthony prime Melo? Lol
No I don't think so   Look at 06 just for instance   Kobe  Lebron   Duncan   KG   Tmac   Steve nash   Jason Kidd   Dwyane wade   Allen Iverson   Dirk   Ray Allen   Vince Carter   Yao ming   Amare Stoudemire   Carmelo Anthony   Chris bosh     Thats 16 guys who all will or are in the hall of fame thats not counting guys like gilbert arenas who put up 29/6/5 or Paul Pierce   7 of those guys were mvps all with in 4 years of 06
Jeremy Lin by Carmelo Anthony. The media spotlight and SAS pitting up Melo vs Lin.
"I am amazed by how stupid you can be to think that because someone isn't on the NBA, when they clearly should, that must mean that every GM saw something that nobody else sees.  As i said, you probably were one of the absolute IDIOTS that thought Carmelo Anthony didn't deserve a job two years ago, right? GMs didn't want to have him and you agree with everything the GMs do, GTFOH."
"Even then, Thanasis is 28, barely plays and offers absolutely nothing on offense (putting you in a situation where is 4v5 on offense), on the other hand, Kostas has played a grand total of 84 minutes in three seasons, so he isn't even a factor.  It's the Carmelo Anthony thing all over again, players that are seem as ""difficult"" struggle to get a chance despite being miles better than ""good guys"" with roster spots. Isaiah Thomas could give you 10 ppg in 20ish minutes with ease, Jared Dudley and Kostas give the Lakers absolutely nothing, they are glorified cheerleaders."
"Anyone that actually thinks Isaiah Thomas can't contribute and be in an NBA roster right now is absolutely clueless and probably are the same people that thought Jared Dudley deserved a roster spot before Carmelo Anthony.  Is he a starter? Fuck no, but can he be a scorer off the bench that comes in and contributes for 15-20 minutes? Yes. Isaiah Thomas can give you 10-15 points in 20ish minutes easily, the fact that actual scrubs like Dudley, Giannis's brother and Jeff Teague (at this point atleast) have roster spots and Isaiah doesn't, is laughable."
"They didn't do shit and lost every year no matter what team you look at. His coaching style is fundamentally bad. You have a certain amount of time to huck up a shot early in the shot clock, otherwise settle for actually running a play in the halfcourt. He runs his players into the fucking ground and has always been bailed out by overplaying his star player. Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, James Harden. There's a reason James Harden led the league in minutes multiple years. Dude is one of the most overrated coaches of all time"
MELO WATCH:  Carmelo Anthony is now just 38 points away from taking the #10 spot in NBA all-time scoring.
Does carmelo anthony not exist?
Carmelo Anthony because he's gone from hated to loved in 18 months.
I think they are. Maybe a bit of bias but we absolutely  maximized what we could get with the Carmelo Anthony trade and also with the Doug McDermott trade
"&gt;The only real issue I see is his 2011 performance. Cool he froze. Couldn‚Äôt decide if he wanted it to be his team or D Wade team. Ok I got it. But since then he‚Äôs been nothing but incredible.  I think game 5 against the celtics doesn't exist. And the thing is MJ never had a series as bad as LeBron. So that stuff matters a lot.  &gt;He should have been unanimous MVP but one guy voted for Carmelo Anthony.  True but MJ should have been unanimous in 1996.  &gt;He should have also been DPOY while winning MVP and FMVP but they gave it Gasol who didn‚Äôt even make the first team all defense.   Marc Gasol deserved DPOY. Although LeBron was close.  &gt;He also went to 8 straight finals and has been to 10. Only one of his finals losses is cause of him and not his team being average.  Very impressive feat, but MJ three peating twice is more impressive.  &gt;Everytime the media wants to declare him the GOAT he has to do some ridiculous thing like beat warriors with KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond. Or beat the Nets with KD, Harden, Kyrie, Blake.  Why is the media relevant in this? The media is stupid.  &gt; But MJ has NEVER beaten a team as good as the 2007 Spurs. Or the 2013 Spurs. Or the 2014 Spurs.   1996 sonics exist you know. And I'm a spurs fan. Also you didn't bring up the pathetic east LeBron destroyed for many years.  &gt;Or the 2016 warriors  The 2016 warriors in the playoffs weren't the same as the 2016 warriors in the regular season.  &gt;Or the 2017 warriors. Or the 2018 warriors.  LeBron never beat those teams  &gt;I don‚Äôt even think he beat a team better than the 2012 thunder.  Such a lie.  &gt;His best competition was maybe the Jazz with Malone and Stockton.  1996 sonics.  &gt;And the whole time he was the favorite.  The Jazz were favorites in 1998 fyi.  &gt;Not just cause he‚Äôs MJ but he had the better team.   LeBron's had more help so idk what you're talking about.  &gt;Playing with 2 of the greatest defenders of all time.  Rodman was only on the team in the 2nd three peat. And Rodman wasn't in his prime  &gt;So no disrespect but people really need to wake up man.  Wow having LeBron has the 2nd best player of all time is so disrespectful."
&gt;his midrange game would make Kobe and Jordan proud.  Seeing him play makes me think like he's been playing 25 seasons ago. That midrange game is sick AF only Carmelo Anthony can rival.
Carmelo? Bro I haven't forgiven them for the Oakley and X-man and Anthony Mason and John Starks hacks and attempted murders.
"2012 Knicks in 2008:   PG: Skinny Ray Felton (14p/7a), Pablo Prigioni (All Euroleague 2nd Team)  SG: Jason Kidd (10p/10a, 38% from 3, All Star), JR Smith (13p, 60% TS, 18 PER)  SF: Carmelo Anthony (26p/7r, 57% TS, All Star)  PF: Amare Stoudemire (25p/9r/2b, 60% FG, All Star, 2nd Team All NBA), Marcus Camby (9p/13r/4b, 1st Team All Defense)  C: Rasheed Wallace (13p/7r/2b, All Star), Tyson Chandler (12p/12r)"
"Oh man I‚Äôve got a few of these.   Tracy McGrady. This dude never made it past the second round and yet is a hall of famer. He was inefficient, an ok passer, a bad defender. He was fun to watch but his game didn‚Äôt translate to winning.   Carmelo Anthony. Almost always inefficient, Melo was never a team player, took horrific shots, couldn‚Äôt play a lick of defence. He only made it out of the first round twice in his entire career. Ridiculous that he was ever in the conversation for MVP, he was literally just a scorer &amp; nothing else.   Shawn Kemp. He was athletic for sure, but people fail to remember he was a coke addict &amp; alcoholic, which noticeably ruined his career. But he‚Äôs seen as some elite PF which is insane.   Amare Stoudamire. He‚Äôs also regarded as an elite PF but, truth is, he was just a mediocre big man that only excelled when he played with 2 time MVP Nash. He was mediocre before Nash &amp; mediocre after him.    Jerry Stackhouse - people see his elite season for us, averaging 30ppg, but fail to realize he was the *definition* of a shot chucker. Awful efficiency, awful defence, awful playmaking. He kept trying to carry entire teams on his own but that never translated to winning."
"Exactly.   Even Kevin Durant, hell Carmelo Anthony too, would choose to get paid 1 million a year and come off the bench on a competing team than to stay with the SUCKramento Kings for 25 million a year."

"Chris ""Paul ""Carmelo Anthony"" Clifton Anthony George"" Paul"
Jayson how influential were players such as Carmelo Anthony and Paul George to you. I know the were some of your favourite players growing up but how does it feel to play against them? What were some of the favourite things the may have said to you when the play against you?
"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"
LeBron taking heat for passing to wide-open teammates for shots in the crunch.  Kawhi Leonard for missing the 2017-2018 season with the Spurs due to an injury.  I‚Äôve also heard some people say that James Harden comes up short in the playoffs because he ‚Äúgoes too hard‚Äù during the regular season.  Carmelo Anthony took extra tens of millions of dollars to re-sign with the Knicks rather than signing with the Bulls or Heat.
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).  KD."
I like Carmelo Anthony.
Lol they will vote for Carmelo anthony or Lou will. If Crawford was still in the league they will vote for him aswell.
Kevin Garnett and Carmelo Anthony eat Honey Nut Cheerios.
That‚Äôs like saying Lillard played with another All-Star because the Ghost of Carmelo Anthony was chucking up shots in a scoring role. I think Porzingis is washed. Guys with that frame and game tend to wear down rather then get back to an All-Star level. He could be out of the league in 4 years.
"&gt; Would have been a great co-ROY, I wish they were more open to doing that with these awards.  I was alive the past 2 times it happened (Grant Hill and Jason Kidd, Elton Brand and Steve Francis), but I have no idea how it happened. Was it not based on a vote tally back then? Or did those pairs somehow end up with the exact same vote tally?   I would've been perfectly fine with this year having co-ROY given the special circumstances of the season. Another year I would've been fine with co-ROY would've been Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony. There's probably more examples that I'm not thinking of right now."
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
"Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, and Hawks legends Carmelo Anthony."
"CJ McCollum, Anfernee Simons, and Carmelo Anthony all hit over 40% from 3 and 80% from the line.  Portland can also throw in a 2037 2nd round pick.  Who says no?"

"People shit on midrange when they're missing them- regardless of user.  They shit on them the most when the offensive person is deemed to ""settle"" for it or especially in ISO situations.      When you get cut off to the basket and feel lazy and just settle for a turn around mid range shot and miss- that's a bad mid range shot.     Manipulating defense off a pick and roll with a mid range jumper while actually running action and TRYING to get good shots is a better use of the shot.  You chose that shot because that's what the defense gave you.  So whether you made it or missed it- you'd rather have Chris Paul shoot that 12 footer in rythym because jokic sagged to stay with Ayton, than Chris Paul back his defender down with no ball movement and shoot a fading turnaround with 14 seconds left on the shot clock.     One was a mid range in the pursuit of creating the best possible shot you can get that offensive possession, where the other is saying ""trust me- I'm better than this defender and I'll make it"" and doesn't get teamates involved etc... Carmelo Anthony style.     Plus they can't tell when to offensive rebound or engage because he does a million fakes and lulls his teamates to sleep (Carmelo).  So I think that's what people shit on the most- is ISO mid range that's just make or miss and doesn't really have multiple path's forward of generating easy buckets (cutters, pick and roll, give and go, a move that makes the midrange they're about to take easier... )  It's boring inefficient basketball."
Carmelo Anthony
I've already told you dude. Read the comments and ingest the information instead of just waiting for your chance to word vomit inaccurate negativity.  Kanter's minutes would've been replaced by Zach Collins. This is neither a Terry or Neil (roster construction) problem since he re-broke his ankle during preseason training camp. It was on Terry to play Kanter over Rondae Hollis Jefferson and Harry Giles at the 5.   Melo's minutes could've been replaced by Derrick Jones Jr and/or Nassir Little. DJJ was our max MLE free agent signing and Nassir Little was a promising 2nd year 1st round pick.  Dame sits for a whole 8-10 minutes a game. During that period we played Anfernee Simons at guard who's a deadly scorer (way more efficient than Carmelo fucking Anthony).  You're just speaking straight nonsense right now. Go away.
"That doesn't make any sense. You're gonna sit here and tell me that Terry playing Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony 20+ minutes a night each didn't negatively affect our defense? That's not a roster issue, that's a coaching issue. You don't need a scheme to ""fix"" it, you just need a coach that isn't a fucking moron who chooses to play offense only players who don't try on defense. The eye test and the statistics prove that Enes Kanter and Melo are two of the worst defensive players in the entire league."
"Weirdly enough, I'm from the Bay Area so I have a soft spot for the Warriors because I enjoyed how low Oracle arena attendance was when I grew up but at the time they were boring and Carmelo Anthony appealed to me most with the Nuggets. The Suns are a great team to watch but this friend of mine has too much hubris for him to realize.  &gt; Wish Murray didn‚Äôt hurt himself cause this would‚Äôve been a hell of a series.  True, he would've bolstered that starting lineup better. I'm also ticked off how Bol Bol barely got used this playoffs but I think his lack of experience (and pure strength) makes Mike Malone hesitant to use him more"
"Nikola Jokic is currently 26, playing for a Denver Nuggets team, who, while playoff bound, can't quite get over the hump. How old was Carmelo Anthony when he was traded from a Denver Nuggets team that was playoff bound but could never get over the hump?   26.  What I'm saying is, get ready for 10 more years of misery Knicks fans"

"Same feeling watching Melo in Portland. He hasn't been great, but it's like, holy shit, that's *Carmelo Anthony* out there."
"You‚Äôre actually so pathetic dude. You just sit here getting downvoted all day for shitty takes that obviously people are going to reject. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm the only person telling you that you‚Äôre exaggerating hardens playoff choking. I‚Äôm not even the first person in this thread that told you that. Nobody agrees with you besides actual brainless morons on twitter that need attention.   There are definitely other top 10 players with playoff resumes comparable to harden. Giannis comes to mind. Embiid and also even durant to an extent. Durant has a bit better resume but I don‚Äôt really care about his rings. On the thunder he had multiple bad series he could have won and ultimately never got it done, even though he got close. Similar to harden. And he had a second star the whole time. Post lakers Dwight had his moments on the rockets, but overall was pretty mediocre and only made the all star team his first year there.  Edit: oh you said average top 10 player. So like throughout history. What about carmelo Anthony? Or cp3? There‚Äôs tons of other dudes that have bad playoff success for a variety of reasons. Tmac was definitely top 10 at some point"
"You should go back and watch some Al Jefferson or early Carmelo Anthony or James Harden highlights.   I remember a play from Harden, when he was on defense and his guy made a backdoor cut. Harden did not notice and was guarding air before the guy finally got the ball.   Carmelo Anthony was all offense and played defense like France in WW2 early in his career.   Al Jefferson literally could not guard anyone. He seemed like a nice guy, but he would give up just as many points as he would score."
Dame could absolutely be the best player on a championship team. If he had another allstar or two on his team like most of these other contenders and not Carmelo Anthony out there.
Carmelo Anthony wasn‚Äôt a stat padder and Mitchell isn‚Äôt either
"No, he is like carmelo anthony - stat padder."
Utah was a better developed team with better team chemistry than the OKC thunder that was struggling between the personalities a Paul George Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony.
Lmao Gallo could‚Äôve only avoided that contact by staying on the floor until a time out a la Carmelo Anthony
Definitely Carmelo Anthony
"Carmelo Anthony, amazing player obviously but he never found sustainable success and both his times in Denver/New York failed  Steve Nash too"
Damian Lillard  Carmelo Anthony  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook   James Harden  Mike Conley  J.J. Redick  Derrick Rose  Paul George  Lou Williams   Paul Milsap  Demarcus Cousins
yeh but like exactly zero of yall currently have carmelo anthony soooooo suck it
"Listen, I'm not going to argue about this anymore lol. This shit is pointless and meaningless debate. But I'll say this...  If Carmelo Anthony can buy into the Olympics and fit alongside other stars, there's no reason why Randle cannot do the same."
i bet you mike d'antoni is loving being back in the east  and instead of carmelo anthony this time he brought harden with him and also gets KD
The ole Carmelo Anthony classic.
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is. His production is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical advanced analytics most of his contributions will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kristaps' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his style of play - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Carmelo Anthony, for instance. The Porzingis stans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his plays, to realise that it's not just bricking 3's - they say something deep about LIFE.  Someone finish this for me."

You mean selfish star player tendencies. Carmelo Anthony isn‚Äôt the first athlete to care more about his stats than winning..
"It‚Äôs weird to think I started watching almost 15 years ago now lol   1. Lebron or Kobe  2. Wade, Chris Paul, Carmelo (banana boat crew), Dwight Howard, Dirk  3. Underappreciated in hindsight is probably Dwight howard and overlooked is probably Chris bosh, especially after he joined the big 3. Bosh was kind of born too early as he would be the perfect big in today‚Äôs NBA.  4. Giannis, Luka, Embiid (if he can stay healthy)  5. Luka, Zion. My hottest take is probably that Anthony edwards has the potential to be in this group with his otherworldly athleticism"
"Luka has 5 40-point playoff games. That‚Äôs more than:      Damian Lillard   Carmelo Anthony   Tracy McGrady   Kyrie Irving   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Vince Carter   Tim Duncan   Karl Malone         **Doncic has played only 13 career playoff games. The players above have played at least 50.**"
"The Mavs for years have been a win now team. They fell ass backwards into a great player with Luka. They generally don't draft talent because they trade all their picks for high cost stars, they are always looking for what they can do to win now. I think them surrounding Luka with talent in his first 2 years and making him have to carry the team to the playoffs is the worst thing that they could have done for him. As a team, they go as far as Luka takes them, and they don't have a method for getting high quality players anymore since every pick that they get is going to be in the late teens, and they would need to develop them while their superstar gets older every year. And if they do choose to trade, the draft capital they would have to give up to outbid a team like the Thunder is going to be immense.   &amp;#x200B;  I think what the Hawks did was executed one of the best tank jobs. Basically take as many bites at the apple as you can in a two year stretch, weaponize your cap space (Hawks legend Carmelo Anthony, and Hawks Legend Chandler Parsons). They took two years to find talent that they felt confident that they could build around. Once they were happy with that, they went and found free agents and spent freely and willingly. If the players that we have become as good as they are supposed to be, some of those free agents can be removed from our cap situation (Gallo, Dunn, and even that Rondo contract)."
He probably has an outstanding arrest warrant there for beating up a woman or something. Also: Carmelo Anthony.
"And people also seem to forget how much more rudimentary defenses were 20 years ago.  Such that iso from 15, pump fake, jab step jab step, pump fake, fade away was considered a good play. Carmelo Anthony still trying to bring that back."
"The Nets have a few second round picks, and I definitely expect them to draft some size. Dinwiddie will be an unrestricted free agent and realistically the Nets will look for a sign and trade somewhere. No matter what they get, it will definitely be somebody that is defensive minded. Also the good thing about contenders is they get players who want to win a championship on a cheaper salary example being Carmelo Anthony and players like that. Also, it'll be interesting to see what Drummond is worth. He practically tanked his value since joining the Lakers so he might only get a one-year mle deal.  Also the Nets are realistically going to try to find someone to take DeAndre Jordan."
The return of Hawks legend Carmelo Anthony
Of course they have a roster problem..the best bench options  they had this year were 400 year old Carmelo Anthony and a second year rookie lmaoo
"doncic is lazy and needs to take his conditioning and fundamentals seriously. if doncic got with a shooting coach and took his form and technique seriously he could become a mid 80% FT shooter and a 40% shooter from 3. if he took his body seriously and got in elite athlete shape instead of carmelo anthony shape he would be so much better as well.   it's insane how naturally skilled Luka Doncic with those problems. he would easily be the best player in the NBA, possibly of all time if he had a better work ethic, or maybe he does have a great work ethic but for some reason is getting bad coaching/development and nobody is telling him to get in better shape or have more consistent fundamentals on his shooting?"
I'll say it... Carmelo Anthony
"Portland is usually just the wrong team for its time. They might have been okay in 2017, but they weren't good enough to beat the Warriors. When Anthony Davis is healthy and in the playoffs, he looks like an all-time great big man. Stotts had to coach against LeBron *and* Davis in the same series in 2020, while the third best player on the Trail Blazers is a gracefully-aging Carmelo Anthony. They really shouldn't have won two series in 2019, but Lillard went off in that first series, faced a young Nuggets squad in the second round then got swept by the Brother Dubs in the WCF.  The Portland Trail Blazers were never winning a title, and they'll probably lose in the first round until Lillard's last season. They exist as an institution in a league that spurns institutions, and they'll never give Dame the sidekick he needs unless Carmelo turns back the clock."
Doncic is the next Carmelo Anthony. Regular season star üòÇ
Carmelo Anthony will never be able to escape D‚ÄôAntoni lmao
"Jokic is the favorite to win it because of injuries/load management and Jokic is undoubtedly a top 10 player right now if not top 5 (I have him at 7).   The only people on that list that were for sure better than Carmelo Anthony in 2012-2013 were LeBron and KD. KG, Tmac, Yao, Nash, Duncan, Dirk didn't even have an argument at this point in their careers. Kobe and CP3, and maybe Westbrook did but I would take 2012-2013 Melo over all of them, both statistically and just based on the eye test.    DRose was injured for the entirety of the 2012-2013 season.   Stoudemire was not better than Melo LMFAO"
All that means is that both Terry Porter and Carmelo Anthony were good enough to play for perennial play-off contenders for one and a half decades in the NBA.  That's extremely impressive.
Still better than Carmelo Anthony
"Fine.  &amp;#x200B;  Let me respond to your ""37 year old Carmelo is better than a 34 year old T-Mac.""  &amp;#x200B;  Well T-Mac wasn't playing, and Carmelo is literally a negative asset on the court, so Tracy not playing puts him above Anthony in terms of helping his team."
Is Kyle Cruisema the new Carmelo Anthony?
"I'm not saying Dame is better than Curry, chief. You can use that argument if you ignore literally all context which you seem intent on doing  Curry had Klay, Iggy, Draymond, Kevin Durant, and an owner that goes over the luxury tax every year to win championships  Dame had CJ and late stage Carmelo Anthony, the fact that he even made a WCF is a miracle at this point"
"Damian Lilard is the new Carmelo Anthony. He could score, hit the big shot, a scoring title and to top it off he has gone to the WCF where the superstar guard of the generation lit him up"
With the random WCF series sprinkled in this is exactly like the Carmelo Anthony Nuggets
And the Portland Playins with their captain Carmelo ‚Äòregular season‚Äô Anthony are eliminated
"Come on Dame and the reanimated corpse of Carmelo Anthony, you can do this!"
"Patrick Ewing, Devin Booker, Carmelo Anthony"
"Props on the Carmelo Anthony bit. Nuggets fans following the team post Melo don't understand why some of us dislike him. He helped turn around the franchise but was an ass on the way out. And he did launch a superstars-can-force-a-trade movement. It was around before that but he launched a new, uglier era of it.   Hopefully the new generation including Mitchell don't do that. That's why Jokic is refreshing, he seems perfectly content in Denver, with no itch to go to NY or LA or Boston."
"compared to luka? meeeeeeh.   almost like getting carmelo anthony instead of lebron james, except yall drafted carmelo first and let lebron call to 3"
The fact that Steph fans consider Andrew Wiggins a scrub that doesn't help with spacing. While also saying CJ McCollum and the corpse of Carmelo Anthony are world beaters giving Dame tons of help is more delusional but you do you.  I don't think Dames better I just put them in the same tier btw.
Damn Carmelo Anthony in 2005 playoffs prevented the sweep in the first round for the Wolves

He‚Äôs an inefficient volume scorer with a nice jumper and excellent footwork and a lot of players give him a lot of respect, despite him being a bad defender and nonexistent playmaker.  Kobe is rated highly by players (especially those that played against him) because he was a menace to compete against on both ends of the floor and made so many crazy shots. While I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs top 2 or even top 5, I can see how playing against him would have players rate him so highly.

Forward Slots were a lot harder to attain than Guard slots in the 00s. 10s not so much, but 2000s was the era of PFs. The 5 greatest PFs of all time (Duncan, Dirk, KG, Malone, Barkley) all played at the same time, and Dirk, Duncan and KG played for nearly 15 seasons side by side.   Kobe played 2 seasons alongside peak MJ, most of his career with Wade, and missed out on almost all of Harden's prime and wasn't playing when Jerry West was active. Kobe receiving more All NBA first teams isn't so much a matter of him being better but rather his position being less stacked during his prime."

As a Celtics fan I can confidently say that Carmelo Anthony deserved to be in the league far more than say Greg Monroe, a player who's playstyle was far outdated for today's game and was on the Celtics, and thus in the NBA, during the year Melo got cut from Houston. The original take revolved around Carmelo playing in China or not deserving to be in the NBA.

Like people mention his dunking but they don't otherwise dwell on his prime, they bring up mostly how he lasted so long as a role player.     But Melo is heavily romanticized by players and fans alike. He's quite likely to make the Hall but definitely is overrated. His inability to be a team player has been papered over by his fanboys and even at his peak he did not contribute much to winning both from an ""eye test"" perspective and on the stat sheet."
The last half-decade happened to Carmelo Anthony.
Bro what happened to Carmelo Anthony?
I guess Carmelo Anthony would be a similar scenario to that one.
Their starting lineup next season will be   PG - Ben Simmons   SG - CJ McCollum    SF - Carmelo Anthony   PF - Rondae Hollis Jefferson   C - Jusuf Nurkic
They enter the nuclear codes and Carmelo Anthony will come out of the silo in a team USA jersey.
Steph Curry is not walking through that door. LeBron James is not walking through that door. Carmelo Anthony is not walking through that door...
"I‚Äôm sorry. I gave Pietrus some serious consideration.  But I currently have him behind LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Ron Artest, Elton Brand, Tyson Chandler, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, and JJ Barrera for the 2000‚Äôs. Maybe if I have time, I‚Äôll do a deep dive on his film and see if he has a case for moving ahead of those guys."
"&gt;Nah‚Ä¶that‚Äôs you when you used the Olympics to indicate the ‚Äúbest NBA players‚Äù so by your logic Carmelo Anthony was the best player in the world at one point.  Good god you're dumb. Please stay away from matches and adult scissors. I don't have the time to try and help you acquire the cognitive skills necessary to understand my post. It's not much, but you are seriously lacking. Get help. It'll make the lives of those that are burdened by having to care for you much easier."
Nah‚Ä¶that‚Äôs you when you used the Olympics to indicate the ‚Äúbest NBA players‚Äù so by your logic Carmelo Anthony was the best player in the world at one point. Lmao
"You edited it dude.   And continue to downvote me even though I haven‚Äôt even said anything remotely outrageous as you have, especially with the Olympics comments. Seriously, this is the first time I‚Äôve seen anybody used the Olympics to evaluate ‚Äúbest NBA players‚Äù‚Ä¶with this logic I suppose Carmelo Anthony was the best player in the world at one point in his career."
"Why not have two? Especially when the player they left off is the best current player signed with Jordan brand. Jordan brand active signature shoe athletes are Zion, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, and Russel Westbrook. Luka is better and more popular than all of them.  I am sure Jordan brand will at some point, but that they have not already is disrespectful to Luka and why I think he should leave."
"I saw Kobe, in a postgame presser in the early 2010s, pay respect to Carmelo by saying, with that Kobe wry smile, ""Carmelo Anthony is a *bad boy.*"" Seemed like the ultimate compliment. I had that feeling watching Giannis these past two games - Giannis is a *bad boy*"

They‚Äôre not supposed to just have ‚Äògood plus minus‚Äô they‚Äôre supposed to be capable of blowing out the competition just as much as the starters (and if the starters can‚Äôt). Draymond Green and Jerami grant? Lol. In years past that would be Chris Bosh and Dwayne wade, or Carmelo Anthony and Paul George."
Carmelo Anthony is rolling over in his ~~grave~~ bed.
Somebody get Carmelo Anthony
"Definitely Larry Brown. That run is a colossal black mark on his resume that remains in a way that it simply doesn‚Äôt for the players. A lot of that is of course that it barely took hindsight to know that Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony needed more minutes. That isn‚Äôt helped by subsequent interviews from players where they place the blame on Brown for failing to adapt to his talent. A failure like that just won‚Äôt go away for Brown."
Carmelo Anthony has 3 gold medals aaaaand 1 bronze medal. Not even Durant can surpass the legacy of Olympic Melo!
Yes. He said so explicitly and sought Lebron‚Äôs help.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/12/4/20995908/nba-free-agency-news-lakers-carmelo-anthony-lebron-james-trail-blazers-houston-rockets-agent  It‚Äôs not like Melo had a ton of suitors. He was willing to go to almost any team. Melo didn‚Äôt throw Lebron under the bus. He said it wasn‚Äôt under his power but I think Lebron has been pretty good track record to get something done when he really wants to.
That gave me LeBron calling out teams for not signing Carmelo Anthony but not telling the Lakers to sign Melo vibes
Demarcus Cousins &amp; Carmelo Anthony
"If Carmelo Anthony teamed up with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen while they were still near their primes, he‚Äôd have a ring too"
"I mean, it's changed a bit since he was in OKC:  &gt;""I'm not sacrificing no bench role,"" Anthony told reporters Saturday after the Oklahoma City Thunder were eliminated from the postseason, according to ESPN.com's Royce Young. ""So that's out of the question."" [Source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773219-carmelo-anthony-shoots-down-idea-he-would-come-off-bench-out-of-the-question)  But yes, he could fine tune his shot selection even more. Maybe playing with Lebron is the best way to do that."

"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who‚Äôs good and how the different titles were won.

"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2d1zx1/question\_how\_did\_the\_pistons\_go\_from\_having\_the  If only they could have fallen to #3... Most GMs had Darko as the clear #2... it was really looked as a draft of...  Tier 1: Bron  Tier 2:  Darko  Tier 3:  Melo, Bosh  Tier 4: Hinrich, Kaman, Wade, Ford  If the Pistons fall to #3 they almost certainly take Carmelo Anthony. The question is... do they pull other moves along with it that would have impacted their ability to acquire Rasheed Wallace? Would they have the bit pieces they would have spread around the league, or made other deals to solidify the roster earlier? Hard to say."
"&gt;Kobe to the Spurs was really on the table?   Honestly there were no trades with anyone that were at all close to happening, so no, not really. Kobe having a No Trade Clause basically was an obstacle that made trading Kobe impossible. The reason is because any trade the Lakers would have been OK with would have left Kobe's new team so drained of assets that Kobe would have vetoed it, and any trade Kobe would have approved wouldn't have given the Lakers enough value back in the trade, so they wouldn't have done it. That's why even though Kobe did everything he could to get the Lakers to trade him, and they explored many different trade scenarios, nothing ever materialized.   It's the same reason why it took the Knicks forever to trade Carmelo Anthony, and it's the same reason why no player in the NBA currently has a No Trade Clause. When a player has a NTC, it makes it basically impossible to move them, even if both the player and the team are willing to move on from each other. The odds that the team trading him and the player being traded will both be happy with the results are very slim."
Carmelo Anthony for the Hawks
"Jermaine O'Neal, Paul George, Blake Griffin, and Carmelo Anthony have all also come 3rd (or 2nd) in MVP voting.  Like PG did just a couple years ago."

"Make up all the excuses you want, and downplay it all you like. A team that has Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul, and Dwight Howard, should never lose the gold. Funny to think that same Miami super team trio would then lose to underdog Dallas in 2011. Really kinda says something."
"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."

"The problem is our good players skew heavily towards guards that play a similar style. We have a lot of good players, but a lot of good players all with similar strengths and weaknesses.

"&gt; Lol the Warriors have Steph and haven‚Äôt won zit since one of their best defenders Klay went down.   Cool ignore that he's one of the best shooters and low maintenance stars ever by being able to score without the ball in his hands to try and prove a point. The point that you missed for all of the other players mentioned is that without their capabilities on the offensive end (keep the defense) they wouldn't be close to being a championship team.  &gt; The Pistons keep coming up because out of 21 Champions that were won with both a superstar and solid defense, the Pistons did it without the superstar, showing just how valuable great defensive players can be.   Because a great way of proving a point is to bring up something that happened 9% of the time .  &gt; You actually think Carmelo Anthony won an NBA championship? Yeah you‚Äôre definitely a casual.   You were talk about pre draft and the Pistons (making a mistake) and drafting Darko over him you dope. I never said an NBA championship for that example. He was a key part of the Syracuse championship team.  &gt; The point about IT still stands.  No shit. Picking an extreme example by bringing up one of the smallest players ever drafted as a senior and now on the wrong side of 30 with an injury history. No shit there were concerns with his defense he's fucking 5'8"""
"Lol the Warriors have Steph and haven‚Äôt won zit since one of their best defenders Klay went down. Lebron is a DPOY runner up, Giannis is a tenacious rim protector to where he gets dunked on at times , KD has 0 wings without the Warriors who were a solid defensive team and the Dirk Mavs were good enough defensively to  hold one of the most talented players of all time below 10.   The Pistons keep coming up because out of 21 Champions that were won with both a superstar and solid defense, the Pistons did it without the superstar, showing just how valuable great defensive players can be. Common basketball knowledge.  The point about IT still stands. You actually think Carmelo Anthony won an NBA championship? Yeah you‚Äôre definitely a casual. Alright never mind this just about explains your point."

If pat bev is dirty, then KG is for fucking sure dirty, being a 'defensive anchor' doesnt give you carte blanch morally bro."
"Dwyane Wade is cool and all, but if you're building an all time offense team, he's not getting picked before Tracy McGrady. Also, Larry Bird and Carmelo Anthony are currently firing their publicists."

Carmelo Anthony - FUCKOUTTAHEREIGOTTHISSHIT
Carmelo Anthony. Weirdly enough he was also the first player I knew
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
"From all I've heard, read, and seen, Larry preferred Carmelo Anthony. But the fact that Brown joined the team *after* so much of the staff had become smitten with Darko Milicic probably put him in a funny spot.   From what I gathered from Brown's comments on that 2019 podcast:  * Brown came aboard thinking Melo would be the pick  * Worked Darko out twice and Darko got winded (Brown not a fan). Melo did not work out for him.   * Director of International Scouting Tony Ronzone told Brown that prior to Brown's arrival Darko had a better workout than Kevin Garnett (this would have been the one at John Jay College in the ECF).   * Brown wanted to get Melo, Wade or Bosh to come in and workout against Darko but agents wouldn't go for that.   * He thought Darko looked like a Greek god and was very skilled but wasn't ready.   It's hard to tell how late in the game Larry still thought they were going with Carmelo, because he seems to readily acknowledge there were a number of folks who were in favor of Darko in the lead-up (""the people around me were convinced"" then the piece about Darko's better-than-KG workout).   If I had to guess, GM Joe Dumars, Director of International Scouting Tony Ronzone, and long-time coach and scout Will Robinson were all likely pro-Darko based upon their statements at the time (Robinson is the one who compared Darko favorably to Wilt's skill set at the same age).   Ronzone, in particular, was held in high esteem on account of being at the forefront of international scouting. He had inroads everywhere and had worked previously with the Mavericks (who, uncoincidentally, were also at the forefront of the international scouting game).   In Detroit, he paid dividends almost immediately. The Pistons were going to grab Jarron Collins in the second round (Jarron, not brother Jason) but Tony told them about Mehmet Okur. Then he was also responsible for Zeljko Rebraca, who had a moment in the sun in Detroit during that first Goin' to Work year then essentially had his career ended by an irregular heartbeat. Carlos Delfino was another Ronzone find.   So it was with that Dumars recounted in 2004, ""This was two years ago that we drafted Mehmet Okur and it was two years ago that he told me that there were some great young kids coming out of Europe. He said there's a kid over there 16 and I'd draft him right now. He said Darko Milicic. He said remember that name.   ""He said, 'Joe, we won't have a chance to get this kid because he'll be a top five pick.' I said we might have a chance, we've got that Memphis pick sitting out there, if we ever got lucky. He said, 'If we ever got that lucky we'd be on cloud nine.' Lo and behold two years later what happens? The ball pops up with the second pick and we get Darko.""   My guess is that Joe, Tony, and company thought it was fate. That everything had perfectly aligned and with a sort of a free shot (since they didn't need an immediate contributor, as much as Brown would have wanted one), Darko was going to be their guy."
"At the time, there was a consensus top 3: Carmelo Anthony, Darko Milicic, and LeBron James.  Those guys were definitely, in some order, going 1-2-3.    There was as much chance of Detroit taking Bosh, Bonner, or Wade as there was of Portland picking Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Sam Perkins, Alvin Robertson or Kevin Willis in 1984 (holy shit though, was that a stacked draft)."
Hawks legend Carmelo Anthony
**Carmelo Anthony** in 2003-04  - The Denver Nuggets were a playoff team with him as the leading scorer. They were a 17 win team the year before   - He had a better record than LeBron‚Äôs Cavaliers   - He had averaged more points and rebounds than LeBron   He could have won if LeBron wasn‚Äôt so popular
"Carmelo Anthony. Nuggets improved by more games than Cavs did, Melo had better stats than LeBron, Melo actually made playoffs in a tougher conference, Melo was more efficient than LeBron and still lost"
Carmelo Anthony - yelling for a rebound
"based on your comment I started building my 1-82 fantasy team around drummond. I would surround him with JR smith, Lance Stephenson, Carmelo Anthony, and Isaiah Thomas as a player coach"
Ben Simmons  Andre Roberson  Cedi Osman  Carmelo Anthony  Enes Kanter   Coach: Doc Rivers   Good luck.
"*Not a Pistons fan but‚Ä¶one of the ultimate moves that sticks out to me, and would change the trajectory of the Franchise and the Future HOFer involved‚Ä¶The Pistons should have drafted Carmelo Anthony instead of Darko Milicic in the 2003 draft.   The Pistons went on to win the 2004 NBA championship with little contribution from Darko. In the following years the team aged and was never to be heard from again. Melo would have gained valuable leadership/championship experience, and help usher in a new era for Detroit."
Bulls - Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony: hawks
so basically jrue holiday and carmelo anthony are mental eskimo brothers
"I'd say the former because of guy like Ben Wallace, Dennis Rodman and Draymond Green who all got rings unlike guy who just care about scoring like James Harden and Carmelo Anthony."
Or you could be Carmelo Anthony
Or when Carmelo Anthony was a Chicago Bull
"Hawks Legend, Carmelo Anthony"
Melo also achieved jackshit without Billups. Amazing how that's forgotten. One player made it to *7* straight Conference Finals. The other player is Carmelo Anthony.
"When your name is LaMelo Ball, the only thing you can do is ball. His name is a combination of LaMarcus Aldridge and Carmelo Anthony, and his last name is ball."
"I was just thinking about this last night. There's usually a couple of immediate tells when it comes to discussing the Detroit Pistons - suggesting one either doesn't know as much as they're projecting or simply weren't around for the era they insist they totally were (watching the Pistons every night, no doubt).   1. Believing that Rasheed Wallace played the entire 2003-04 championship season with the Pistons.   2. Referring to Isiah Thomas as IT instead of Zeke. It technically works because initials, but it's akin to the next generation trumpeting their love for Carmelo Anthony by making posts like, ""Aw man, CA was a legend!""   3. The belief that Bill Laimbeer was only a goon with no discernable basketball talent. Believing his goonery overshadows his known skills is one thing, being completely unaware of his skills are another (four-time all-star, rebounding champ, one time record holder for 3-pointers in a single finals game).   4. The insistence that Isiah Thomas wasn't the leader of those two Pistons championship teams. At times I've even heard some insist that Dennis Rodman was the leader and best player on those squads. In fact, there are a number of Isiah Thomas-as-a-player misconceptions that seem to serve as a tell that someone has just come back from a quick BBall Reference run.   It's super possible for very knowledgeable folks to have these misconceptions; none of us know everything. But those are a few that usually give me pause and make me consider for a moment whether the person speaking actually knows what they claim."
So Carmelo Anthony. Gotcha
And his Carmelo Anthony Hawks jersey
the disrespect to Hawks LEGEND Carmelo Kyam Anthony
"For the fun of it, I tried to make the worst reasonable super team under that definition, 2016: Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond"
"Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook."
"Carmelo Anthony. He's a player that only knows how to score, a player that's too lazy to spend any energy defending. I could say that he doesn't play winning basketball, but instead I'm going to say he plays losing basketball.  Said by Billups:  &gt;It meant too much. Because he could have games where he had 20, 22 [points], we‚Äôd win and he‚Äôs mad. He might have 36, and he‚Äôs in there, you know‚Äîwe lose the game, and he‚Äôs in there picking everybody up. Scoring 30 meant too much.  I will never understand how people saw him as a good player. A good scorer? Absolutely. A good player? Hell no. Not only you can't build a winning team around him, for years he didn't even accept being part of a winning team built around someone else. Now that he's sort of willing to do it, he's almost unplayable because he's the best at putting up empty stats and being a negative on defense. Melo is Kevin Martin with better publicity."
Carmelo Anthony. What has he done besides get paid for not winning anything?

"People in a recent thread were saying, Carmelo Anthony, is a better scorer than Kawhi, if that doesn't scream overrated to you then... Kawhi scoring elevates in the Playoffs, Melo's does not."
Carmelo Anthony once went 1/16 for 2 points in an elimination game and was -14 in a 2 point loss
"Kevin Garnett and Carmelo Anthony in the infamous honey nut cheerios situation was pretty wild lol, but legends like kobe, bird and mj also had countless stories"

"&gt;Carmelo Anthony- He‚Äôll be remembered like Adrian Dantley, great scorer but never 1st Team All-NBA  Melo kind of deserves it as he chose the money over competing for a title twice in his career when he had a chance to make a move, so I won't feel sorry for him if he never wins a ring and fades in to obscurity."
&gt;Carmelo Anthony   Nephew alert
"I feel like this question really depends on the timeframe. 10 years from now, few major current stars will be totally forgotten. Very few people will forget Harden, CP, Carmelo Anthony, etc. Few serious fans will even forget Beal, KAT, Derozan, etc. Most people on this sub ‚Äì¬†even ones who didn't necessarily watch the NBA in the early 2000s ‚Äì¬†still could probably name a fair number of all-star level players from that era.  20, 30, 40 years from now the story is different. Think of how many players most people could name from the '80s. It's pretty much HAJ, Bird, Magic, Kareem, and Jordan (the latter two being more prominent in the '90s anyways). If you go back to '70s, most people could probably only name two or three players.  Given that, pretty much everyone named in this thread will be forgotten. The only current players who people in 2050 are likely to remember as things stand now are Lebron, Steph, and KD. If Kawhi or Giannis win more championships, then potentially they could join the list as well."
Carmelo Anthony.
"Feel like he‚Äôs had this opinion for quite some time.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18331035/george-karl-criticizes-carmelo-anthony-together-denver-nuggets  Yes he‚Äôs drumming up book sales because he‚Äôs doing press for the book, and being asked these questions. But his thoughts on Melo are not new.  For the record I think Karl seems like an asshole, which is what drove him out of the league."
Do you want to see Jamal Crawford and Carmelo Anthony in the top 10?   Because that‚Äôs how you see Jamal Crawford and Carmelo Anthony in the top 10
"Lebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on."
"Carmelo Anthony is also an open racist, so there's that."
Have you heard of this other guy called Carmelo Anthony?   Washed up stars humbling themselves and taking on a diminished role isn't unheard of.
"Bruh you really googled ""Lebron vs Carmelo"" and posted a link without even opening the article. That article literally talks about how *LeBron* had a slight edge during their rookie years and then the gap massively widened after that. The article's point is literally that Melo was never at LeBron's level, and the only time it was even close was when they were brand new in the league.   Here are some quotes from the article you would have seen if you had read it:  * *In the end, James ran away with the \[Rookie of the Year\] award. ESPN.com's Marc Stein explained the choice thus: ""'Melo had a fabulous rookie season, but he doesn't have the multi-faceted game yet to overcome everything Cleveland was missing.""* * *In the second year of their respective careers (2004-05), LeBron blew Carmelo out of the water...If any voters had lingering doubts about the 2004 Rookie of the Year race, James' second season should have silenced those. From that point on, Carmelo would never come close to dethroning LeBron as the league's best small forward.* * *Over the next two seasons, Anthony asserted himself as one of the league's preeminent scorers, averaging 26.5 points per game in 2005-06 and 28.9 points per game in 2006-07. There was only one problem: James exploded for 31.4 points per game in 2005-06, eliminating Carmelo's one major advantage over him. In both seasons, LeBron continued to outpace Carmelo in terms of rebounds, assists, PER and win shares.* * *By the fifth year of their respective careers, the LeBron-Carmelo debate had been rendered largely moot. If your life depended upon a player creating a 25-foot jumper for himself and draining it, you might pick Anthony; otherwise, James had clearly established himself as the superior player.* * *During his final two years with Cleveland, LeBron put even more distance between himself and Carmelo. He posted back-to-back PERs above 30 while accruing more than 38 total win shares, leading the league in both categories each year. For his efforts, he earned two consecutive regular-season MVP awards.* * *In 2008-09, Anthony finished with a PER of 19.0 (tied for 31st in the league) and 5.0 win shares (tied for 93rd). He improved upon both the following season, ending up with a PER of 22.2 (13th) and 7.9 win shares (tied for 30th) but still came nowhere close to even equaling James‚Äîmuch less surpassing him.*  Read articles before you link them."

"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"

"I had never heard of this before, but looking at their page, they're at least well-funded and aren't a fly-by-night operation.  Some familiar names I see are Carmelo Anthony and Jay Williams on the Board of Directors, Kevin Ollie as a coach, and Avery Johnson:  https://www.overtimeelite.com/leadership   And:  &gt; ""Overtime [the parent company] recently announced it raised $80 million in Series C funding from top VC firms, industry leaders and athletes including Jeff Bezos, Drake and 25+ NBA stars including Trae Young, Devin Booker and Pau Gasol.""  But yeah, it's pretty risky for the players at this point when it's all just getting started, and they're figuring out how to operate.   But if the kid gets a decent salary plus some amount of equity and the league becomes valuable later, it possibly could turn out to be a good decision (or quite good, depending on the equity)... as long as it doesn't significantly hamper his development as a player right now.  There's also a lot more info here:  https://www.overtimeelite.com/facts"
"I doubt that will happen. I had never heard of them before, but they have some pretty established people involved, including Carmelo Anthony and Jay Williams on the Board of Directors.  And apparently like 30 NBA players have invested in the parent company, including Kevin Durant."

"What‚Äôs funny is when Carmelo was still a Knick a lot of fans ripped him and all of a sudden he‚Äôs been  romanticized since he was almost forced out of the league and signed with Portland. I‚Äôm a Knicks fan, I like Carmelo but don‚Äôt worship him like some Knicks fans do. Anyone who says Carmelo is better than Kawhi Leonard has no idea what they are talking about. Anthony has won three playoff series in his almost 20 year career and the last one was 2013. You don‚Äôt even need to bring out the numbers, anyone who watched both guys play at their peak can easily see its Leonard who is the far superior player. His play in the 2017 and 2019 seasons prove that and if he doesn‚Äôt get hurt by a dirty player in 2017 he could very well have led an upset to a super team (that he eventually beat a few years later). Kawhi has faced and beaten iconic and historic teams. Carmelo‚Äôs biggest playoff series win was against, at the time, the fraud Dallas Mavericks and the old men Celtics."
"&gt; Also Carmelo Anthony has 3 gold medals, 25000 points, a collegiate title, a 10x all star and I still hear from morons saying he shouldn't be in the hall of fame.  Yeah, they're morons. Reggie is HoF and deserves it. Melo will be HoF and deserves it."
"teams today shoot 15 more threes than they did in 2012-2013. that's a significant boost for efficiency/scoring, not even including spacing  When those guys played in 2012-2013... Melo outscored them both. With less minutes than both on a much worse team.   Here is Melo's starting lineup with the Knicks in 2012-2013:  Carmelo Anthony  Raymond Felton  Tyson Chandler  Iman Shumpert  Jason Kidd (39 yrs old)   with a mix of ELITE PLAYERS starting games sometimes as well, like:   Ronnie Brewer - 34 GS  Pablo Prigioni (35 yrs old) - 18 GS  Kurt Thomas (40 yrs old) - 17 GS  James White (not the patriots RB) - 16 GS  Chris Copeland - 13 GS  Kenyon Martin - 11 GS"
"As I remember, he was mostly guarded by the opposing team's small forward, shooting guard or athletic bigs like:   Peja, Turkoglu, Al Harrington, Marion, Rashard Lewis, Rasheed Wallace, Artest, Keon Clark, Horry, Bonzi Wells,  Kenyon Martin, Stephen Jackson, James Posey, etc.   Most centers can't guard him (Shaq, Divac, Brad Miller, Jermaine O'Neal, Ben Wallace, Ilgauskas, Mutombo, etc.) as he always beat them off the dribble.   And surprisingly, Duncan never guarded him that much. It's mostly Matt Bonner, Bruce Bowen, Horry, Ginobili, or some other capable wing.   During the Nash/Fin/Dirk era, I mostly remembered teams sticking just one guy on him.    They don't double-team him as he's not really the primary option back then -- it was either Finley or Nash.    He's also an intelligent passer so, you can't really double him on the perimeter. And he's constantly in motion.  But when Nash and Finley left, teams started doubling him with an athletic wing/forward (see: 2006 finals and 2007 first-round).   To counter this, they usually put him on the nail -- just above the free-throw line where he has an option to either drive, pull up, or pass.   His post-game is already developed, but it's not as good as around 2008 onwards.    If you want to see how his post-game developed go back to the 2009 playoffs vs the Nuggets. He's cooking Kenyon Martin, Carmelo Anthony, and Nene during that series. Sadly they didn't win."
"2000 - 2007 Dirk is much more athletic than KP. But not only that, Dirk has better footwork, tighter handles, lower body strength, and a quick first step to get past most guards/wings/big men at that time -- something KP won't be able to do. Dirk in his first 7 years is more like a Giannis/Durant/Klay Thompson hybrid.  2008 - 2019 Dirk is more of a low-post, mid-range, stretch 5 kind of player like Anthony Davis/Carmelo Anthony/LaMarcus Aldridge. I think old-man Dirk is the best comparison to KP given how many injury and mobility issues he already suffered these past few years."
- Chris Paul - Devin Booker - James Harden - Carmelo Anthony - Ben Simmons
"1. James Harden carries the ball - like all the time. Some borderline traveling too. He's not a legitimate MVP.  2. The NBA doesn't really call carries anymore in general, probably because they don't want to put a damper on the scoring.  3. Carmelo Anthony is a cancer. You couldn't pay me to take him.  4. Paul George is overrated."
"I literally got into debates with other users that he's top 20 of all time and they cited a lot of advanced stats and Ben Taylor from Thinking Basketball.   Like, I know the Iverson and Carmelo Anthony aren't the most loved guys here but a lot of dudes here rank Miller over them"

Sorry I meant Carmelo Anthony not LaMelo Ball
"I agree Gobert could be better individually against a switching defense. But I also think even at his current skill level the team could do a better job of supporting him and getting him the ball in positions where he can score even with his limited skill set. I'm not sure he's ever played with someone who's actually good at throwing lobs. This might just be a homer opinion because he's my favorite player though.  Another big problem the Jazz had against the Clippers was that the Clippers guards were getting past the non-Gobert defenders with ease on pretty much every play. If the other Jazz defenders did a better job staying in front of their man Gobert wouldn't have to leave a shooter to prevent an uncontested layup so often. I would like to give Donovan Mitchell a pass on this since he was clearly limited by his ankle injury but he's not very good on defense when he's uninjured either. Bogdanovic was another major culprit. He had some surprisingly good defensive possessions against Kawhi at the beginning of the series, but in the games the Jazz were losing he made Marcus Morris look like prime Carmelo Anthony on face-up jabstep midrange jumpers. I don't know if the data is publicly available to tell for sure but I swear Morris shot like 80% when guarded by Bogdanovic."
A good friend of mine swears up and down that Carmelo Anthony is not worthy of a first ballot Hall of Fame vote. I wholeheartedly disagree. Thoughts?
Carmelo Anthony is the most overrated player in NBA history.

Definitely solid.   Carmelo Anthony / Anthony Tolliver / Big Baby Davis
"&gt; The Lin thing has been objectively debunked.  Whether or not the team wanted him back has no bearing on whether or not Melo was unhappy with the way Lin's prominence impacted the team's offense. Calling Lin's contract ""ridiculous"", in the context of the obvious tension between the two, is not so easy to explain away. There's plenty of stories written on this with quotes from players, including one where Stoudemire essentially confirms that there was some unhappiness with Lin's success.  - https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/2/29/11133088/amare-stoudemire-carmelo-anthony-jeremy-lin-knicks  Ultimately you can explain Melo's career through whatever lens you like, but you can't avoid his teams' underwhelming achievement given in spite of his considerable offensive talent. I don't have a dog in this fight, I neither liked nor disliked Melo, he was just one of the many great players that has come through the NBA that I've seen. Now that his career is nearly over, I do find attempts to scrub his past disappointing. The guy did it his way, and if he wins with the Lakers, that'll also be because he grew as a player. No one is static, there's no need to revise history."

"&gt; Karl obviously is incapable of being civil and polite. What are we supposed to do, just let these shitty toxic people attack everyone and then nobody can say anything in response? People that think like you are why the average person is so toxic.  Let me get this straight.  So, because I think it's shitty to tell people to ""go die"", *I'm* the reason people are toxic?  DBAA.  Exactly.  And you know what, telling someone to ""go die"" is......  that's right.  Being an asshole.  If you respond to someone being an asshole by being an asshole, you're still being an asshole.  That's some weird ass logic.   It's absolutely petty for George Karl to harping on Melo.  But you know what?  Carmelo Anthony is a grown ass man.  He can handle his own shit, he doesn't need people telling Geroge Karl to ""rot in hell"" on his behalf.    Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying or you misunderstood what I'm saying.  But just because a guy said your favorite player was a ball hog and didn't play defense, however petty that may be, does not mean ""go die"" is an appropriate, reasonable, or emotionally healthy response to said guy."
"Carmelo Anthony Davis  Yes, those are 3 players. And yes, that's a solid lineup."

I was going to say Carmelo Anthony. Their personalities are rather similar.
"Rose also had no off-court issues like that, Rose is still universally appreciated as a guts-n-glory type of player and has a signature shoe and all that cause fans around the world respect him. I'd say if Carmelo Anthony hadnt come back, he would fit the best as a comparison."

"&gt;I need to get the fact check but I think Carmelo Anthony is the only player to win ROTM every month of his rookie year but not get ROTY because LeBron had the same in the East  To be fair, it also helps that he was the only rookie drafted in the top 5 to play in the West."
"Fight between Knicks and Nuggets.  This was only 2 years  after a couple notable things.  Malice in the Palace &amp; Carmelo Anthony stupidly making an appearance in a gang DVD called *Stop Snitchin*.  Carmelo's DVD explanation? Basically... *it's a prank bro*.  Like many players, they already knew he had gang connections, but all of it together was just too much."
Carmelo anthony comes to mind.
"It‚Äôs Carmelo Anthony   College title, mvp level seasons on good teams that could never get the title in the pros, washed out of the league trying to play like they always have   Cams reinvention role player (backup/gadget) tour is next up on the path"
Carmelo Anthony for sure
"Carmelo Anthony, both him and Cam early on thought to be one of the best in the league. Neither won championships despite the talent, got a knock against them cut and both out of jobs later in their careers despite both thinking they are still great."
"Carmelo anthony, huge hype coming out of college. MVP caliber player that never had a great team around him. And then fizzled out and now should be playing but nobody picked him up because he‚Äôs past his prime, just as melo during his years off."
"The Lakers can‚Äôt be at peace without signing Carmelo Anthony to a one-year, $2.5M deal, league source tells ESPN."
I need to get the fact check but I think Carmelo Anthony is the only player to win ROTM every month of his rookie year but not get ROTY because LeBron had the same in the East
"Yeah, I watched English, but to me, he reminds me more of like a Carmelo Anthony. He scored more finessely, but I just viewed him as a great regular season scorer and not much else.   I agree it‚Äôs hard comparing across eras, but I did the best I can do in order to control for differences in defense.  Thanks for the comment. Will post Hakeem/Shaq when I get around to it doing the analysis."
"I always thought it was bullshit that John Starks was considered a hard nosed 3 and D player (one of the first, tbh), except he wasn't actually that good on defense and also just a slightly above average 3 point shooter.  I mean, he *tried* really hard on defense and was slightly above average, and he was never shy about shooting the ball (despite the fact that he shot 34% from 3 over his career), and his rise from being an undrafted player makes for a great story but that doesn't really excuse his play.  &gt; Carmelo Anthony is considered one of the greatest scorer but has 1 scoring title.   Ehh, he's definitely not known as one of the greatest scorers of all time.  He's known as a superstar who is a scorer and not much else."
"Carmelo Anthony, DNP (Went to a better place)"
"Lol at making it sound like Durant had the better supporting case that year  That's like saying ""the Lakers have LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, if they don't win it's the biggest choke in NBA history"""
"Carmelo Anthony is going to be the Laker's new Jared Dudley in that his media contributions are going to far, far exceed his on-court contributions."
If Carmelo Anthony can average 15 points a game at 36/37 years old coming off the bench then i expect KD to be better for longer. As he is more skilled and has more physical tools. He will probably be scoring an efficient 21+ points for a very long time.
"Okay you're really not understanding what either of us are saying and thus this conversation has become useless  Let me reiterate the most important piece of context to this situation, **melo stated 2-3 consistently before and during the season he wouldn't come off the bench**. I already gave you one source for that, I found 2 more in the 5 minutes of googling I did if you're interested  Your entire comment is based on misunderstanding what I'm trying to explain so I'm not going to put in the effort for the first 90% of it, but  &gt;This is: &gt; &gt;1. Speculation on your part &gt; &gt;2. Makes absolutely no sense. Carmelo was coming off an all-star year and the GM and coach all discussed them being a big 3. Your take of this is completely anachronistic.  Yes it's speculation, that's why I said it's what most likely happened lol. And it makes sense, I have no idea what world you're living in where you just ignore the entire context of that time (including **saying he won't come off the bench**) and like you say, just coming off an all star season, so ""why would you ask him?"" to come off the bench  **In conclusion, this isn't some big make Carmelo Anthony look bad conspiracy by the media. He said himself he's not coming off the bench. Sometimes the simplest answer is correct, he didn't want to come off the bench and he's trying to save face in a podcast, and all the evidence and what he's saying points to that**.   But for some reason you think this is some big media conspiracy and keep conveniently ignoring the fact that I keep bringing up his own quotes of not coming off the bench. So, like I said, this conversation has become useless lol"

"Fuck Dwayne Wade no shot he's more likeable than LeBron or CP3. I don't even like LeBron as a person and CP3 is dirty as hell but Dwayne Wade is unbelievably hateable  Here's what they could all potentially be hateable for:  Carmelo Anthony - ego, ""me? come off the bench?"", pushing Jeremy Lin out of New York, forcing D'Antoni out of New York.   Chris Paul - Dirty player, flopper, shit talker  Dwayne Wade - Dunk contest nonsense, mocking Dirk for being sick, flopper, defending Nick Cannon. Any Mavericks fan can list like 1000 more probably  LeBron - Mocking Dirk for being sick, China stuff, Klutch Sports, some people think he's full of himself"
"Dwayne Wade would‚Äôve been the obvious choice because once you‚Äôre retired people don‚Äôt give you as much crap, but since the dunk contest incident, I‚Äôm gonna go with Carmelo Anthony, because of his comeback story."
Awesome Interview of Carmelo Anthony with Big Cat and PFTCommenter from Barstool Sports.
"Carmelo Anthony, WHO WAS ON CRACK!"
"Yep, 2003-04 was KG's MVP year and the only year the Wolves ever won a playoff series, beating the Nuggets (rookie Carmelo Anthony appearance) in the first round, and then the Kings in the next round, before Cassell got hurt and they lost to the Lakers. Best year in Timberwolves history!"
Carmelo Anthony. Man completely transformed New York basketball. You couldn't go to a court without someone putting a three to the dome. I don't think any player will ever overshadow the first player that truly made you fall in love with a team or a sport and that was Melo for every Knicks fan my age
"We were the number 3 offense in the nba starting Hassan whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and Trevor Ariza. Tell me dame isn‚Äôt a good playmaker. We are a top 3 offense every year"
"Or for more pain for Portland, Carmelo ‚ÄúClyde Drexler‚Äù Anthony"
"Carmelo ""Gary Payton"" Anthony"
"Yes, because it‚Äôs very clear that players who demand trades lose respect in the NBA player circle.   That‚Äôs why guys like:  James Harden, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Kawhii Leonard, Jimmy Butler, etc.  get no respect around the league. Oh wait, that‚Äôs not true at all? Weird."
Jeremy Lin &gt;  CarMelo Anthony (as in the Knicks shoulda kept Lin over Melo)
Paul Pierce &gt; Carmelo Anthony. I won't live or die on this but its a strong take.
"Uhhhh this comment is wild.   Kawhi is 100% on this list. He‚Äôs a 2x FMVP and won a DPOY.   Dwight Howard won three DPOYs and was the consensus best center in the game for half a decade. He will be on this list.   And you don‚Äôt think Russell Westbrook is even ‚Äúin the conversation‚Äù? He‚Äôs widely viewed as a top 10 point guard of all time, some say top 5. Russ is on this list for sure.   I think Carmelo Anthony makes it, but it‚Äôs fair to say he‚Äôs questionable. Davis I agree with you, could go either way."
"Allen Iverson   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Chris Paul   Damian Lillard   Dennis Rodman   Dirk Nowitzki   Dominique Wilkins   Dwayne Wade   Dwight Howard   Gary Payton   Giannis Antetokounmpo   James Harden   Jason Kidd   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Kevin Garnett   Klay Thompson   Kobe Bryant   Kyrie Irving   LeBron James   Manu Ginobili   Pau Gasol   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Reggie Miller   Russell Westbrook   Stephen Curry   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Tony Parker   Tracy McGrady   Vince Carter"

"Carmelo Anthony.  Anthony had most of the tools LeBron did when they both started out (LeBron was more athletic but Melo was definitely more skilled offensively initially, both were roughly the same height/weight, both completely dominated their peers on their way to the NBA).  But over the years LeBron kept pushing himself to get better in the NBA, and he did keep getting better, while Anthony... just didn't.    Now one guy is an all-timer while the other guy is sort of a ""what-if'er."""
"You're saying that Bernard King, Dominque Wilkins, and Carmelo Anthony provide about as much value as, for example, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson?"
Derrick rose Carmelo Anthony. No chance Middleton over melo
"I was high on DSJ and Markelle Fultz before..you know.   There was Jabari Parker who I predicted would be the next Carmelo Anthony. I also had Kidd Gilchrist, who I personally thought was gonna be a star.   Mario Hezonja is another...the hype was real back then."
"Lonzo, Drummond, Westbrook, Derozan, Zach Randolph, Joakim Noah, Josh Smith, Paul Millsap, Stoudemire, Bynum, Wiggins, Carmelo Anthony  And finally:  *Chris Paul*"
"Not that old but I found quite good ""Melodrama"" and ""Dwightmare"" for Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard when they request a trade from their team (the Nuggets and Magic respectively)."
"I mean I could say Carmelo Anthony is better than Jordan and it‚Äôs a totally valid opinion, but that ain‚Äôt gonna make it any less dumb   There‚Äôs literally no reason to say Wilt is better than Jordan unless you wanted to purposefully be ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô than everyone else. There‚Äôs literally no other reason."
How many does Carmelo Anthony have?  Because I feel like he had like 3-4 in one season as a Nugget about a decade back but they could've just been game winners and I'm misremembering.  I feel like he'd be up there though.
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
"This is an actual debate with the Pistons and Darko.   If the Pistons select Carmelo Anthony, do they trade for Rasheed Wallace?   Maybe not, which alters their entire trajectory."
"Yeah, people acting pretty weird about Beasley.    When Schroeder got to OKC he went for albatross contract of Carmelo Anthony and a protected first because he had problems with the law."
"Charles Barkley would easily be considered as being better than Malone, if he'd shot 35% on the obscene amount of 3's he attempted  Ben Simmons - Shooting  Trae Young - Defense (Trae's doing well for himself, but the dude would be the frontrunner for both MVP and MIP, if he magically became an average defender)  Young Rondo - Shooting (he'd be seen in the same light as CP3)  Roy Hibbert - Shooting  Carmelo Anthony - Defense  Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams and all the other microwave guards throughout NBA history - Defense  Blake Griffin, Amar'e and all the other athletic forwards that never became true superstars - Defense and/or Shooting"

"Our team's focus on winning a championship has no bearing on Darko's attitude from the day he was drafted.   &gt; Guy played less than 5 mins per game.. that‚Äôs straight garbage mins. They shit canned him immediately.  What do you not understand about the fact that he was drunk in practices while not trying whenever he actually got minutes. Name a single player who wouldn't be canned given the circumstances?   &gt; It‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre a pistons fan which is why you feel emotional and sleighed by the guy but show a bit of humility here.  Whatever you wanna think, I just think it's hilarious how you're making so many excuses for a player I'm 90% sure you never even watched or followed while trying to tell me, someone who watched nearly every single game the guy played for us, what the actual issue was. Believe me, if Carmelo Anthony played for the Pistons he would have gotten plenty of ""development and minutes"" we didn't just not play Darko because he was a foreign rookie. We didn't play Darko because he was garbage and put in zero effort towards improving."
Carmelo Anthony is an open member of the 5 percent Nation which believes that white people were invented in a cave in Africa by an evil scientist and are the natural evil in the world meant to oppose the natural good which are black people. Just fyi.
"Carmelo Anthony  Besides scoring titles and All Stars, what awards has gotten during his prime. 1 conference finals appearance all other runs were 1st or 2nd round exists. Short prime where he was cursed with injuries and has been bounced around the league getting worse every year. Chance to bounce back but he‚Äôs only got 1-2 seasons left imo"

"You‚Äôre not wrong that other wise deserving guys get left off bcz of limited roster spots but the issue is that KG was arguably the best PF in the league that year. You‚Äôre really telling me Elton Brand, Shawn Marion, and Carmelo Anthony were more deserving for an all nba spot than KG?"
Westbrook MVP statement game w/ triple double record and buzzer beater against the Denver Nuggets  Carmelo Anthony Easter 2012  Bulls-Hornets 2019 ridiculous comeback by LaVine  Paul George's Pacers MVP stint is already getting forgotten about sadly
"Can name a few   LeBron James, I hated all the hype he got in his early career. Was an avid Carmelo Anthony fan and thought he would be better. I definitely grew to love watching LeBron play.   Kobe Bryant. Allen Iverson is my favorite all time player, so that was a big influence in me disliking kobe. I did grow to love watching him play, and grew to love him as a person. RIP  Jimmy Butler. For a while I thought he was an asshole but he definitely is just committed to winning. Have to respect someone who gives their all trying to win with whatever team he is on."
"Opposite: Carmelo Anthony. I started loving him, and now I dislike him. If you told me that he‚Äôs never sniff a championship around ‚Äò07 I would have told you you‚Äôre insane. Now as an old I understand why he never came close and it bums me out"
Carmelo Anthony. I hated the Blazers signing him. I miss him so much now üò≠
"Tracy McGrady (01-08) - 26 ppg, 6 reb, 6 ast; 44% FG, 34% 3pt, 75% FT; 52% TS  Carmelo Anthony (09-14) - 26 ppg, 7 reb, 3 ast; 45% FG, 37% 3pt, 83% FT; 55% TS  So over that respect prime for TMac, Melo is scoring the same but more efficiently (both have similar roles on offense) and is just overall shooting better. TMac gets you two assists more and Melo gets you an extra rebound. Then obviously the added bonus is Melo's longevity (you could expand this window of play longer for Melo)."
"Carmelo Anthony. I used to mock him for his style of play never leading to a championship ring...but, you know, he loves basketball and so do I...so...shrug. We're cool."
"Carmelo Anthony  When he played with the Blazers he got the respect from many people who used to hate him and considered him an empty stats washed player, including myself"
Oh that makes more sense. I don‚Äôt agree tho. We were getting Carmelo Anthony and I have no doubt the could have attracted another star to New York like a Chris Paul or even Dwayne Wade. Much easier to convince someone to join Bron and Melo in MSG than Bron then just Bron in Cleveland of all places. At the end of the day I think he made the right choice because he got two rings out of it but I do definitely think he could‚Äôve done what he did in Miami in New York
I just remember a bunch of reports like this:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1375878-carmelo-anthony-reportedly-jealous-of-linsanity-ran-jeremy-lin-out-of-new-york
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."
"Lebron, Carmelo, Westbrook, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Trevor Ariza, DeAndre Jordan, Wayne Ellington. That's a very deep playoff team and it's not losing to anyone. Miles better than that Heat team."
"Don‚Äôt forget the Carmelo Anthony trade for Denver - he got a veritable haul for a disgruntled expiring contract star who had made it clear which team he wanted to go to.  And then he fleeced the Knicks again with the Bargnani trade. We got the pick that became the 9th overall pick for him, which became Poeltl, which became Kawhi, which became championship.  And then he fleeced the Knicks AGAIN by not even doing anything, as Dolan was so scared of being fleeced by Masai that he declined an offer to get Lowry in a trade"

Carmelo Anthony has a wine podcast. That‚Äôs the real news story here.
"He's as much a star at this point as Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap... Aja he used to be one but now isn't"
"If Carmelo Anthony, Monta Ellis and Jamal Crawford. aren‚Äôt your favourite players then you are a defective human being."
dont forget the last phase where they are past their prime when everyone likes them again  (Carmelo Anthony effect)
Steven Adams. Also Carmelo Anthony made a joke about Russ stealing rebounds when they were teammates in OKC
"Jeremy Lin stans are also pretty die-hard. I've always found it odd that an established veteran bucket getter, in Carmelo Anthony, was framed as an *evil* selfish dude because he didn't take a back seat to a dude on a hot shooting streak."
"‚ÄúThere he goes.‚Äù Carmelo Anthony gave a look of absolute disinterest. Dwight Howard yelled ‚ÄúIs it still the preseason?‚Äù And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Laker star Russell Westbrook put on skinny jeans and Urkel suspenders &amp; said, ‚ÄúDid I do that?.‚Äù"
Carmelo Anthony shot worst than Russell Westbrook from 3. Think about that.
Ahh the team of misfits:  Mr.Anthony ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find me hobbling on the floor‚Äù Davis  Mr. Russel ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just jacking it‚Äù Westbrook  Mr. Carmelo ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me overrated‚Äù Anthony  Mr. Rajon ‚Äúthey call me tough‚Äù Rondo  Mr. Deandre ‚ÄúI just wanna be in LA eating veggies‚Äù Jordan  Mr. Dwight ‚ÄúI call myself Superman‚Äù Howard
" [Spears] LeBron James yelled, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù Carmelo Anthony gave a look of expected disappointment. Russell Westbrook belted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got an [expletive] ejection now.‚Äù And before Anthony Davis hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star and living human being Kobe Bryant hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall disrespect my franchise.‚Äù"
"Carmelo ""Colin Robinson"" Anthony just sucking the life outta every other forward on his roster and taking all their mins haha"
replace Caruso with Westbrook and things happen. Also Carmelo Anthony is a toddler on defense.
"Well, welcome to reality nitwits, the 38 years old just played 32 minutes, went 1-8 from 3pt range against OKC (airball as a bonus). What did I just said in other comments, it's pointless to give so much playing time to a washed up Carmelo Anthony, the guy is a huge liability in a scenario like this. If Vogel plays him for 10, 12 minutes at best, ok.. why not. But to go over 20 minutes, lol that's literally a gunshot at their own feet, it's completely idiotic"
"Carmelo Anthony to the Knicks was an awful trade for both sides. The Nuggets were left with a sub-par set of players and had to go into rebuild mode, and the Knicks had to gut a ton of their best assets just to acquire Melo, all because he didn't want to wait until free agency."
"KNICKS GET: expiring Carmelo Anthony contract (he was going to sign with them in the offseason anyway since he telegraphed that they were the only team he wanted to go to... but he wanted to play for them immediately and New York catered to his wishes)  NUGGETS GET: Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, Raymond Felton, draft picks (including Jamal Murray)."
OKC legend Carmelo Anthony is gonna have to carry I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"In 1997, the Vancouver Grizzlies traded a future first round pick with shrinking lottery protections over time for journeyman power forward Otis Thorpe, who was 35 years old. Thorpe played 47 games for the Grizzlies before being traded with Chris Robinson to Sacramento for Bobby Hurley and Michael Smith, neither of whom made an impact with the Grizz.  The Grizz sucked and kept getting lottery picks, and in 2003 the protection dropped to only the first pick. The ping pong balls fell the Grizzlies way; for the Detroit Pistons, for one of the greatest drafts in NBA history. The Grizz could have draft Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh.   The only happy thing about this is the Pistons drafted a bust in Darko Milicic.   The Grizzlies won 14 games in 1996-97, and I have no idea why they thought trading a first round pick for Otis Thorpe would make any sense."
[s‚Äôcuse me?](https://tenor.com/view/carmelo-anthony-nba-gif-7829782)
"So as you can see, the title of the post is ‚ÄúMistaken Identity‚Äù, implying you mistake someone‚Äôs first initial and last name for someone else.   OP sees ‚ÄúC. Anthony - ORL‚Äù and thinks ‚ÄúCarmelo Anthony? He plays for the Magic?‚Äù before realizing it‚Äôs Cole Anthony.   I hope this helps."
I called Giannis a ‚ÄúRobin‚Äù at one point implying he needed a bigger star to win a title. When the Blazers signed Carmelo Anthony I called him ‚Äúwashed‚Äù and said he would last with the team for a month at best before he would be released. But the all timer has to be when I said Lebron James would never live up to the hype when drafted and playing for the Cavs would ruin him.
WTF was carmelo anthony was thinking there ?
Since I was just on his bball reference page for a different comment‚Ä¶ Carmelo Anthony averaged 28 points 3 different times including as a 22 year old. You are right though Lamelo really looks good on paper and when you watch him but I‚Äôm still taking some of Carmelos elite seasons over sophomore Lamelo
"is there any version of Carmelo Anthony that somebody is taking ahead of current LaMelo? He's scored a lot of points and had some great yrs, but I doubt he could lead a team to wins as well as LaMelo can. Not even a big dig at Melo, LaMelo is just a beast and fits the modern game so well."
"yeah or even the other day when they went down by 20 or 30 to the suns  youd think they would want to play hard to beat the suns to avoid going 0-2 and to prove they can beat the suns cause of last years playoffs  but as soon as the suns started pulling away late in the 2nd and in the 3rd lebron became super passive and that bad effort and body language reappeared.   like he was just deciding the game is over, why bother trying anymore.  only game 2, on to the next one  it was actually carmelo anthony who said fuck that and kept playing hard and inspired the team to at least try a comeback and ended up making it only a 10 point loss.   and then the next game melo balls out and gets the lakers their first win  I kept saying the team should rally around melo cause even if he isn't nearly as good a player as lebron, he's bringing a positive attitude that they desperately need"
"Carmelo Anthony is the most over rated player in the NBA, and possibly in league history"
Paul pierce is better than ray allen and carmelo anthony i have this argument all the time with my friends

Carmelo Anthony should not be on that list

"Just to highlight how long ago 5 years is, 5 years ago, the following players played in the All Star Game: Isaiah Thomas, John Wall, Kevin Love, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan.  Those guys have had varying degrees of success since then, and contribute to winning, but when was the last time anyone thought of any of those guys as stars?"

"Carmelo is an open racist. It doesn't take that much digging, he doest try to hide it.  Google ""5 percent nation Carmelo Anthony"""
"TFW you check the box score and Carmelo Anthony was the most efficient scorer in the game, just as expected"
"What? lol His hero shooting in the mid 00s lead to nowhere. Like I said, it was pointless, taking 27 shots per game (which is pure insanity), scoring 35pts and then gets killed in the first round (losing a 3-1 by the way). When Kobe had the best big in the game at his side sharing the load, that's when he won multiple championships. Not even Jordan was able to win by playing hero ball, imagine freaking Carmelo Anthony, lol or Lillard, you name it, for how long casuals will be mesmerized by something pointless as this? It was not enough to see Durant playing hero ball last playoffs and failing in the process? How many examples you people need to wake the fuck up and stop praising inefficiency? Durant tried so hard he literally had no stamina left to finish the job, hero ball is not a valid strategy"

If only Carmelo Anthony had this attitude during Linsanity.
"I can. Melo wanted to start. He chafed at the idea of being on the bench. His attitude in OKC was toxic and his production in Houston was horrible.  Carmelo Anthony needed four years to learn how to be a role player. I‚Äôm not kidding. Yes he has scored a lot, yes I like him, but let‚Äôs not distort the truth about what actually happened that led him to sitting for an entire season."
"Wow, the more you look at the Lakers' boxscore, the less you like their chances.  DeAndre Jordan and Kent Bazemore starting? Austin Reeves with 18 minutes and Rondo with the DNP? Carmelo Anthony the 6th man? Anxiously awaiting Kendrick Nunn's return from injury?"

Sucks that for a couple of weeks people are gonna pretend that Carmelo Anthony is still good
"First time **ever** that LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Austin Reaves, and Anthony Davis have won a game together. We've all been waiting years for this moment"
"Imagine having trouble with your starters, so you just call Carmelo Anthony to shoot 75% from 3 and 67% in total to drop 28. Insane"
CARMELO ANTHONY
Literally the ghost of Carmelo Anthony fighting to keep the Lakers away from 0-3.
"In a game with Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony  Ja Morant is the best player on the floor by far."
LMAO everyone was so hung up about Westbrook they forgot about the real third star Carmelo Anthony
laker legend carmelo anthony
I have never said a bad thing about Carmelo Anthony ever
The real third star this whole time was Carmelo Anthony
austin reaves must be thinking he's going to wake up any second lmao... literally in the game with teammates lebron james russell westbrook dwight howard and carmelo anthony
"I mean you can argue tit for tat all day about intangibles and other parts of the game all you want. When you ask the question: ‚ÄúIs Carmelo Anthony a top 75 player in the history of the NBA?‚Äù The answer is yes without a doubt 100/100 times, and that‚Äôs all this list is."
"A few years ago, Carmelo Anthony was headed to the CBA"
Carmelo Anthony with Denver
Carmelo Anthony?
Carmelo Anthony. No further questions.
Considering LeBron wanted Andre Drummond and Carmelo Anthony on his team I'm not sure LeBron knows what's best for LeBron
"Luka, Blake griffin, Carmelo Anthony"
Carmelo Anthony.
"Yeah, came here to say this. Westbrook just looks entirely out of place and he‚Äôs getting targeted on defense on top of that now. I‚Äôve heard people talk about how maybe the answer is to play him with the 2nd team mostly but I think that‚Äôs flawed because‚Ä¶  - Westbrook has to buy into that and aside from the reality that that situation will be the only way he‚Äôd be able to have a lockdown grip on the offense, he‚Äôs also been a first team guy all his career.  - Who are you closing out games with? If it‚Äôs Westbrook I don‚Äôt see how he just magically becomes a fit with AD and LeBron in the last 8 minutes of a game.  - They‚Äôre giving Carmelo Anthony a lot of second team minutes and even a squad of backups playing against a team with both Westbrook and Anthony on the court at the same time will feast on the offensive end.  They‚Äôll figure something over the next 80 games I‚Äôm sure but‚Ä¶ what? It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs going to suddenly start shooting well from 3 or being an effective roll man on picks after never ever doing that before in his career. And in the half court offense, who would you really rather run the offense through, LeBron or Russell? Even when they were both in their primes the answer was clearly James."
"No good reason - carmelo Anthony, why? His fans are the most annoying bunch. Loyal to the core. But annoying.  Good reasons- harden (flopper), and blake griffin (dirty player)"
Carmelo Anthony simply by being drafted by the Nuggets. Could you imagine him in that Pistons squad instead?
So how about Carmelo Anthony?
"I think Carmelo Anthony. I know a lot of people don‚Äôt like him. His run with the Nuggets was underwhelming, could Lebrun James have done more with those teams, yes. But look at every playoff series he lost, how many times was he the favorite? The Knicks run was just as bad. Everybody wants to say well if he didn‚Äôt demand a trade the Knicks could have signed him in the offseason and used those draft picks to build around him. With the evidence we have their management at the time would have not have used those picks wisely. The Knicks never used their cap space wisely and their development of players just flat out sucked."
"Outside of CP3 and Patrick Ewing:   Carmelo Anthony, Dominique Wilkins, and lowkey Dame Lillard, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler"
Especially when you have Anthony Davis and Carmelo Anthony. The announcers used Anthony for each at separate times.
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
Team cancer Carmelo Anthony planted the seeds though. It‚Äôs obvious when you consider he‚Äôs pretty much the only Laker who doesn‚Äôt come into frame to break up the fight.
PLAYER	TEAM	AGE  Andre Iguodala	GSW	37  Carmelo Anthony	LAL	37  Chris Paul	PHX	36  LaMarcus Aldridge	BKN	36  LeBron James	LAL	36  P.J. Tucker	MIA	36  Paul Millsap	BKN	36  Al Horford	BOS	35
"I love the way you put this, I feel it is relevant to many aging players that were dominant for an extended period. Carmelo Anthony fell into that category a few years back before his stint with Portland. I feel he became much more self aware at that point about the reality of current skill level and I was happy to see that sort of personal growth in him."
"They certainly haven't done anything to make their offseason look any better. I don't understand why Carmelo Anthony, Deandre Jordon, and Rajon Rondo are on this team?"
Carmelo Anthony Vs Suns
"My dream scenario- LeBron gets injured or banned or something where he can‚Äôt play rest of the season. Lakers don‚Äôt have their star. Carmelo Anthony balls out like it‚Äôs 2007 again. He gets lakers all the way to the finals. Carmelo gets his ring, LeBron technically does but he does nothing to contribute. It‚Äôs perfect"
There was no need to lob that to Dwight wide open. And throwing a lob to 68 year old Carmelo Anthony can't be a wise decision.
"I can't help but wonder how much of this ""first option"" stuff is just situational though. Klay has never had the chance to be a first option because he's always been on Steph's team. Is that a legit knock against him? I feel like that kind of criticism is what makes some players feel like they need to go be ""the man"" somewhere. Like just being a great team player doesn't really do it for a lot of fans, so they feel like they need to go prove they can be the best player on a team somewhere.   Ray Allen was the number one option for a bunch of years, but it's not like those were championship winning teams. If Klay had been traded for Kevin Love way back, could he have led the Wolves to the playoffs as the team's best player? Maybe. I can't say for sure that he couldn't have done that.   Some players are best suited to be the second best player on a team rather than the best. Some players are best suited to be that number one option, but that doesn't automatically mean that team will be great with them in that role. There's a lot of guys who are alphas on teams that don't win. Should we give them more credit than the second best players on teams that *do* win?   To wit, are guys like Allen Iverson or Carmelo Anthony better than someone like Scottie Pippen or Anthony Davis just because the former guys were best suited as #1 options and the second group were best suited as #2 guys? Or to bring it back to Ray Allen, was he better as the #1 option or when he was the #2, #3 or even #4 option?   Some guys get drafted into situations where they don't have the chance to be the team's best player just because there's already someone there who's better. Is that a knock against them? Should someone like Klay have demanded a trade to go be the #1 option on some other team? Is his legacy being penalized for not having done so?"
Nothing is ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù until you retire. PJ Tucker got a ring before Harden and CP3.   How much money would you have put on that happening say...back in 2018 or 2019.   Hell Jeremy Lin got a ring before Carmelo Anthony...if you really want to get specific.
"Wow amazing comment. However, I watched all the Spurs playoff games from 2002 till now and in the eye test Manu was irreplaceable. I don't think any of the statistics you mentioned can truly capture the player that Manu was. Obviously, I'm a fan and I'm biased, but he was an integral part of a team that dominated the 2000's and stayed relevant for half a decade afterwards, IMO his importance as a player in the NBA is greater than other great players who played in his era and were included in the list (Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook)."
Elite defender Carmelo Anthony and lockdown defender Damian Lillard
He's really committed to being B- Carmelo Anthony
"It has a bit to do with inflation but mostly with the NBA vastly expanding.    A lot has changed with salary cap and salary negotiating over the past 30 years, but to keep it simple, I'll just compare his contracts with similar recent contracts and how it would change with inflation.  In 96, the salary cap was 24.3M. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 42.13M. The salary cap for this season is set at 112.414M.   AI was the first pick in 1996 and signed a 3 years/8.9M contract. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 15.4M. Anthony Edwards was the first pick last year and signed a 4 years/44M contract.   He signed his rookie extension for 6 years/70.88M in 1999 set to kick in in 2001. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 116M. Luka just signed his super max 5 years/207M set to kick in in 2022  He then signed a 4 years/73.5M extention in 2004. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 105M. Last year, Giannis just signed his 5 years/228M super max.  After being bought out by the Grizzlies,AI finished his career with a 1year/1.03M vet min in 09. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 1.3M. Carmelo just signed a vet min for 2.5M."
"Lol, Harden, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Paul George, Vince Carter, Kobe, Garnet, Carmelo Anthony‚Ä¶.  All with various amounts of time left on their deals but they all got paid in full.  No NBA player with a guaranteed contract has ever lost significant amounts of money besides Larry Sanders who retired."
"He was **slightly** better than Carmelo Anthony as a player, even if he didn‚Äôt have as many accolades or public perception on his side.   Loved watching him as a kid"
"first of all, finishing 4th or 5th in MVP voting isn't really anything noteworthy. It's good and all, but isn't something that really ""adds"" to how a player was. I'd argue that overall the league was just worse when Dwight Howard was getting those votes. Dwight had one year where he finished second in voting behind DRose. That is pretty impressive, I'd argue Dame probably has that in him just as much. Once again though, look at the guys that Dwight is beating out on the voting. Dame is losing out to a much stiffer competition, once again. Dwight is the last ranked great guy before a slew of ""very good season"" type of guys who never won an MVP sit. Yes in 09 Tim Duncan was below him..a Tim Duncan not really in his prime anymore. Otherwise Dwight is ranking above guys like..Chauncey Billups and Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony.   Meanwhile Dame finishes 4th in 2018 behind...Harden, LeBron, AD and he's beating out Westbrook, Giannis, KD. 2019 he finishes 6th ahead of guys like..KD, Embiid, Kawhi, Westbrook, behind Jokic, Harden, Giannis.   I'd argue from an objective PoV, Dame plays in a much more competitive era than Dwight did. The late 00s were infamous for being one of the least competitive eras. Dwight only makes the finals in 09 because KG is injured, otherwise the Celtics were probably the best team in the league. Otherwise what other teams were really competitive in the late 00s? LeBron and the Cavs? It takes a bit of context to sort understand that today there are more all time great players playing compared to back then."
AD over Carmelo Anthony?????? Come on man Melo is the 10th highest scorer of all time stop this nonsense

SG - Kobe Bryant (somehow has like 15 all-defensive teams but isn't in the top 500 in defensive rating and is underneath Kevin Love in defensive win shares/48, shot about 40% in NBA finals matchups and about 30% in the clutch over his career)  PG - Magic Johnson (regularly see him in top 5s, but was absolute garbage on defense and shooting the ball)"

Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don‚Äôt result in superstars is flat out wrong."
I have a problem with Carmelo Anthony being on this list too‚Ä¶..mostly hype!
Carmelo Anthony made the list........

"Carmelo kawhi, Anthony davis"
How is Carmelo Anthony on this list?
"Correct. Bob McAdoo and Dominique Wilkins.  3 guys made it in, but weren't on the original list and were mid career. Dennis Rodman, Reggie Miller and Gary Payton.  There were other guys in the league / rookies but obviously didn't have enough resume, since it was 1996/97. That gets Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.  Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce were another year or two away and Dwayne Wade was a few more years.  The rest of the new list is all active. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook.  No real issues maybe other than Davis and Lillard, how do they stack up against full career Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Vince Carter and especially nearly full career Dwight Howard who seems a glaring omission. Does Grant Hill get any leeway for what he should've become and proved he could be (although for not long enough)?  Anyone likely a lock for this in 25 years when they do 100 years? Doncic? Jokic? Embiid? T. Young? Tatum?"
"Bullshit. Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, and Rajon Rondo are all on the active roster.  That right there is more star power than the entire Kings team, meanwhile we're missing Harrison Barnes and (much less importantly) Marvin Bagley."
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"Carmelo Anthony is a better 3-point shooter this season(42,7%) than Steph Curry(42,3%)  /s"
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
What's your favorite team? It would be fun for me as a Knicks fan to watch Carmelo Anthony to play for your team and put up 25 shots a game.
I would love to see Carmelo Anthony in the three point contest
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
"Because you say you ""have never seen what what he can do without having an all star team around him."" Your own words. No player wins it all without any All-Stars on their team. It's to point out how dumb your statement is. That and Curry last year played pretty freaking amazing if you asked anyone who watched. How many teams had way more help than him last year? What numbers was he putting up on what efficiency?  I mention LeBron because he couldn't do it on his own, and he's a bigger, stronger, and more athletic player than Curry. He wouldn't win any rings without All-Stars on his team. Heat with Wade and Bosh, and then Ray Allen, Cleveland with Love and Irving. Now Lakers with Anthony Davis, Westbrook, and Carmelo (a maybe).  Even Nowitzki had Jason Kidd, Tyson Chandler, Shawn Marion, and Peja, but most were past their prime.  No one player is great enough to win it all without any All-Star support. Finals teams are just too good + all the champs have 2-3 solid offensive options. Stop being stupid with the ""we haven't seen what X can do without all-stars"" lmaos."
"Terry Rozier, Carmelo Anthony, LaMelo Ball all had worse 2FG seasons recently. As I said it's bad but not catastrophic"
"You're taking it the wrong way, nobody is against the Rockets on this side of the issue (well, except maybe John Wall lol). The problem is the league moving goalposts all the time while saying it's under the guise of ""preservation of the integrity of the game"". Even if they're right (in principle), the way they're handling it is more consistent with the reasons of loss of revenue/ fan attendance  From [NBA Denies Threatening Pelicans with Fines for Benching Anthony Davis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/sports/nba-anthony-davis-fines.html)      This season, though, several players with smaller profiles than Davis have been shelved by their teams in anticipation of a trade without any public pushback from the N.B.A.          Like Davis, Chandler Parsons of Memphis and Carmelo Anthony, the former Houston Rocket, wanted to play but were benched for months.

Freaking Carmelo Anthony played 40+ minutes lmfao
"Carmelo Anthony never had the chance to shoot a game winner, game-tying, go-ahead shot since becoming a Laker. Never. Russ missed vs OKC. AD missed vs CHA. Lebron missed a lot tonight.  Just leaving this here: https://www.nba.com/blazers/forwardcenter/carmelo-strengthens-case-best-closer-his-generation-game-winner-toronto"
58 year old Carmelo Anthony also played 43
Malik Monk and Carmelo Anthony anchoring the Lakers' offense in 2021 is a sentence I never expected to type.
I saw a guy wear a lance stephenson Hornets jersey at pinks hot dog once  Also saw some dude actually wear a Carmelo Anthony Hawks jersey lol
Carmelo Anthony. Us Knicks fans never had any bad will towards him and the trade was something both sides needed as management continuously failed him.
"The only 1 and done NCAA champs in recent history are Carmelo Anthony, Greg Oden, and Anthony Davis. At least of the top picks.  It's pretty rare for a freshman to the best player on their college team and they go on to win the title."
Are you Carmelo Anthony?  Joking aside you're completely right. Iverson was a straight up icon both on and off the court
"Muggsy Bogues, in 1994, averaged more RPG than PJ Tucker and Carmelo Anthony did last year.   Muggsy Bogues is shorter than Betty White."
"Second-oldest player in the league, behind only fellow Laker Carmelo Anthony."
"Oh cool I didn‚Äôt see it initially, alright just read through it. So I see what you‚Äôre saying about diminishing returns, but honestly I‚Äôd still just keep things simple and go with a better player lol.   If you‚Äôre worried about a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù player who is ok with being a role player, I‚Äôd submit for your consideration 2021 Carmelo Anthony... much more scoring pop than Horry and pretty comfortable being a 3rd - 5th option at this point in his career."
"&gt;Man, Carmelo Anthony wasn't even hot shit in his prime.  https://imgur.com/qpmDOsQ"
Carmelo Anthony ia their best acquisition everyone else has been awful
"Oh yeah but it's totally worth it to have a bunch of old assholes trying to ride their one last year's chance to get a ride.   Man, Carmelo Anthony wasn't even hot shit in his prime."

"DAJ? I didn't know if that was weird comment on the center position like Dwight Anthony and Jordan. He was known by just DJ in his clipper days but he can't be the whole reason the lakers defense is bad he doesn't play that many minutes.  We have so many minimum players, Carmelo never plays D, avery bradley was cut this year. I keep hoping Lebron with fix this but this is a bad team we may lose so much it doesn't matter. Last year i was hoping we could repeat cause we had the Suns lined up but injuries and age finished that and we got older. Vogel is trying, who do you want to coach Fizdale?"

Carmelo Anthony form tonight can be credited to Russell Westbrook working with him on his shooting mechanics.
New York Knicks legend Carmelo Anthony leading the Knicks to another win with his shooting
"I can‚Äôt stand Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Carmelo Anthony and I hope none of them ever wins a ring."
Carmelo Anthony is the Lakers only hope right now with Westbrook floundering
Complete list of players who can play power forward on the Lakers roster:  Trevor Ariza (injured)  LeBron James (suspended)  Carmelo Anthony (doesn't play defense)  Anthony Davis  ---  I'd keep him at the 4 for the time being.
tatum honestly seems like the next mid carmelo anthony to me
But Carmelo Anthony led a bunch of trash to the playoffs every single year in the stacked 2000s west starting as a 20 year old?   I can‚Äôt have this conversation again
"I refuse to acknowledge anything good the Warriors do and will continue spreading Curry, Klay and Draymond slander until the day I die.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful basketball‚Äù don‚Äôt care, didn‚Äôt watch, Nets better and I hope they fail.  I have love for every former Rocket except Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony. They didn‚Äôt do anything particularly wrong other than be old I just associate them with the downfall of our championship window. It‚Äôs not even a Lakers thing, I love Dwight."
"I don‚Äôt think building around his skill set necessarily would have been the biggest issue. It would have been more building around his personality. Skill wise I imagine it would be similar to building around Carmelo Anthony. But do you really want Beasley as your best player and team leader, the guy you have to depend on to be at his best EVERY night?"
"As a first generation Asian-American who spends plenty of time in circles with native born Asians, plenty of them only know Jeremy Lin for his ethnicity. The fact of the matter is that yes, Jeremy Lin, was born in California, but he's more prominent in the public eye of most Asians because he's Taiwanese-American. My Korea-born dad who doesn't know who James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, or Dwight Howard are knows who Jeremy Lin is."
I hope Carmelo Anthony never wins a ring. He's a cocky player and I feel like he was directly responsible for Jeremy Lin bouncing around the league after his tenure on the Knicks.
Carmelo Anthony...?
Reminds me one of the 2k games where Carmelo Anthony would call himself me7o in texts to your myplayer.
The Knicks traded Carmelo Anthony for Carmelo Anthony?
i always remember the clip of a beat writer for OKC asking him what he thought about coming off the bench. he was like.... are you serious... im carmelo anthony...
So Carmelo Anthony failed in what Jeremy Lin could have made possible? Thanks for your insight.  This Lin talk in this sub is so annoying. We all no how mediocre that player his.
"Alright guys, let's run this through an AI text generator and see what else Gilbert has to say...  ""üèÜüèÜüèÜ #1NOBODY2BALL #2WASNBBALL  In the back and forth, Cousins did not hold back on trash talk, bringing up the Kobe vs. Shaq and Carmelo Anthony vs. Kevin Garnett confrontations.  ""I'm a young buck in this league. I feel like me going up there, kicking the king's a\*\* a little bit, or going at somebody in the organization like, 'Yo, c'mon, just let it go. Don't come and get me like you're Kobe. Don't try and come at me. Don't get in my face. I'm gonna let you come at me, you know. You let these cats come at me,'"" Cousins said. ""I might take a few shots. I might even take a couple. But I'm gonna step away from the king's a\*\*. I'm gonna step away from the Kobe ass, too. I'm a grown a\*\* man. I'm here to defend myself when it comes to me getting dirty in the streets. You just do that and you're gone. But in the arena, that's a different deal. A lot of people are scared to get dirty in the arena. People aren't scared to get dirty on TV and social media. So, I'm going to defend myself.""  Cousins also says ""Team Charles"" doesn't mean anything.  ""I'm Team Boogie. It's on and off the court. It's who I am,"" Cousins said. ""A lot of people say 'Team Boogie' or 'Team Cousins.' That don't mean nothing to me. I ain't got no Twitter or Facebook or nothing like that. So, don't look up and down my mentions. It's just hype.

While Warriors fans and NBA Twitter won't have to worry about Cousins in the Bay Area, the forward will still have to get through the Kings.  ""I just want to play basketball,"" Cousins said.

"To be fair, it's not George Karl's fault. He'd have done better if Carmelo Anthony hadn't decided to play basketball in high school."
"Russell, Anthony, and Carmelo were amazing in the 4th. About time we show some fight!"
All I'm saying is 20% into the season and Carmelo Anthony has contributed more to winning games than LeBron James.
"A week ago, after our win against the Spurs I wrote that this team ain't winning shit and was downvoted to oblivion. (shoutout /u/ihateeuge)  **It took supernatural effort to get the win vs a rebuilding Detroit team, who shot 12% in the 4th quater, and we still end up giving 110+ points.**   But seriously, the Lakers, as they are right now, are horrible. This team simply is constructed in way that there is no possible solution to what is going on now.   Westbrook has been detrimental on both sides of the floor. No defense what so ever, doesn't box out, has no lateral quickness to switch when covering, doesn't go above screens, and simply doesn't hustle enough at any time to cover where he is short.  On offense sloppy turnovers, and all around bad shooting. Even his attacking in the paint has been underwhelming.   DeAndre Jordan shouldn't be on the floor more than 7-10 minutes per game. Nothing more to say there.   Anthony Davis has been great, but it won't be enough for this team to overcome all other deficiencies. LeBron James has been more injured than playing, and even when playing you could see him simply not engaged enough on defense to work. Elington, Howard, Carmelo, Monk - none of them solve what we lost this season. Solid lengthy defenders that could cover a lot of ground and chase around switches all night long. No matter what your offense is, if you can't at least provide some kind of hustle in trying to disrupt opponents schemes, you literally have to shoot perfectly all night long to negate your (non)existence in defence. **In other words - THIS TEAM CAN'T BUY A STOP!**   I seriously don't blame Vogel for this. He has proven his system can work when given personnel that suit his ideology of basketball. But because Pelinka is a bitch hiding behind his atroucious management decision this offseason, and Jeannie all supporting this, he'll be the first victim to fall in a line of this sad, miserable season that will, at best, finish with a 1st round exit. That is, if we secure playoffs."

"Just blocked Grant too  They got Carmelo and Wesbtrook out there, maybe don't target Anthony Davis idk"
Carmelo Anthony needs to stfu. Lebron did the wrong thing
"I imagine him coming back disguised as Carmelo Anthony, scoring a bucket, then high-tailing it out of the arena"
&gt;THT on the lakers is a bigger defensive liability than Carmelo Anthony  You cannot possibly believe this.
"&gt;Anthony, who dropped Mardy Collins with a punch, said Sunday he was sorry his emotions got the best of him.  &gt;Just as things appeared to be calming down, Anthony threw a hard punch that floored Collins  &gt;Anthony was suspended 15 games for punching Knicks guard Mardy Collins during the Nuggets' 123-100 blowout victory in New York on Dec. 16, 2006.  https://abc13.com/sports/rockets-carmelo-anthony-remembers-2006-nba-fight/4528529/  &gt;Mr. Anthony, the Nuggets‚Äô forward who punched Mardy Collins of the Knicks, received a 15-game suspension and will be sitting out until late January.  https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/business/25anthony.html  You keep posting the video and somehow every major report remembers it differently.    https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2700761  &gt;then later said Collins chased him.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOAEz9uK6GY&amp;t=317s  Put on subtitles since apparently your eyes aren't working for you.  Mardy Collins, Jared Jeffries, and Nate Robinson.  You've been wrong about just every aspect of this."
"He later wrote an [article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/05/05/yes-voted-carmelo-anthony-for-mvp-and-for-good-reason/Yo08ZgzGaxzlt9KF0JDfqM/story.html) to justify his vote.      Ultimately it comes down to:      &gt; My vote had more to do with Anthony and less to do with the dominance of LeBron. If you were to take Anthony off the Knicks, they are a lottery team. James plays with two other All-Stars, the league's all-time 3-point leader, a defensive stalwart, and a fearless point guard.      -       &gt; This isn't the Best Player in the Game award, it's the Most Valuable Player award. I thought Anthony was the most valuable player to his team this season, not the best player in the league.    -      &gt; Anthony led the league in scoring average and basically carried an old Knicks team to the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Amar'e Stoudemire missed most of the season with knee issues, Raymond Felton missed six weeks, and Tyson Chandler dealt with nagging injuries, leaving Anthony, J.R. Smith, and a bunch of lottery picks from the mid-1990s to win 54 games and beat the Miami Heat three times."
What could go wrong when you replace 3 of your top 6 defenders with *checks notes* Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony
"I absolutely hate this kind of take.  You people sometimes make these presumptions that a player can in no way adapt and play a role that is within their skill set and  fits the team better.  Russell Westbrook can in no way play a spot up shooter or any shooter for that matter, that's not within his skill set, his shot was always bad and no one trusts that he's going to improve it at this age. However Derozan can shoot and players don't lose their ability to shoot once their role changes in a certain lineup. Players don't lose their ability to shoot the ball if they don't dribble it beforehand. The ones that do lose it, lose it because of their ego or laziness. Case in point - Carmelo Anthony.  As the matter of fact I don't understand how can people still have this take after witnessing the past 5 years of Melo's career. Dude never lost the ability to shoot the ball, the only thing that needed adjusting was his own ego.  So no, Buddy Hield is not a better fit than Derozan because they are both human basketball players, not some one dimensional video game characters, and one is just simply better than the other at almost everything."
"I still religiously play NBA Live 2005, it's not even the best of that era I just like how two year Carmelo Anthony is the goat in that game because he's on the cover"
"And that's bad. Their team has  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russel Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony. Then they have great centers like  DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard.   Unless it is a known fact they're all washed up, that team is supposed to be scary, at least offensively."
"I mentioned Book and Kobe because they were the highest point totals, but you're right they were the least likely to get to 100. Now that I've had some time, I looked up the 60 point games in the least minutes played (note this is total minutes played in the game, not fastest to 60) and those I think show that it is breakable:    * Klay 60 - 29 min  * Harden 60 - 31 min  * Gervin 63 - 33 min  * Kobe 62 - 33 min  * Steph 62 - 36 min  * Kobe 61 - 36 min  * Harden 61 - 37 min  * Carmelo 62 - 38 min  * Bradley Beal 61 - 38 min  * Add in Lillard x2, Kobe x2, Iverson, LeBron all with 60 in just over 40 min.   From the above, none were trying to break the record. They sat out a lot of time because the game was won and they didn't want an injury. We also have so many 20 point quarters these days, it's ridiculous:   * Klay, Iverson, Zach Lavine each have 10 20 point quarters  * Westbrook and McGrady have have 12  * Booker and Anthony have 14  * Lillard has 19  * LeBron has 20  * Harden has 25  * Steph has 34   * Kobe has 36  Fuck man, Klay got 37 in just one quarter. I'm not saying it's easy or a shoe-in, but it is not unbreakable. You just need someone like these guys to string a few quarters together and WANT it badly enough. Get 60 in the first half and don't sit. Three pointers have helped tremendously in the accessibility of this record.   Imagine Curry goes absolutely bonkers beyond bonkers. He has like 10 games with 11 3s made and again, sits out the 4th in a number of those. What's to really stop him from making 22 one day, then driving for 10 layups as the try to stop the 3, and foul him enough to get 14 FTs."
Everyone forgets that the NBA announced HGH was either banned or going to be tested for in like 2014 and a lot of the top level guys had articles floating around about how much they slimmed down and people were like hmmmmmm  These are the two examples I remember  LeBron said he lost 20 lbs by doing a 67 day paleo diet: https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/lebron-james-67-day-diet-helped-him-weight-loss  Carmelo said he started eating better and working out harder: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-carmelo-anthony-lost-weight-2014-8
"I'm not saying that holding onto Ben is a wonderful alternative.. I'm not saying his trade value will be boosted or that a team will definitely have a distressed asset and be willing to trade.. it's a bad option but every other option is bad too. Heck I don't hate a McCollum trade either but if I were to rank I would  prefer just holding Simmons.  I'm glad you brought up the other instances of players trying to force their way out. Why don't you tell me what happened to the teams that traded the star? It was either disastrous half the time like Vince Carter or in a best case scenario like Carmelo Anthony they got wonderful roleplayers... that eventually never helped win anything of note.  No team has benefitted from trying to wait out the situation but no team has benefitted, in terms of contention, from making the trade either. And unlike all of those past scenarios, Simmons is under contract for 4 years."
Do this again but for carmelo anthony on the knicks
Mark Jones just randomly decided it was Carmelo Anthony during the game tonight.
Carmelo Anthony  Probably the only time the Nuggets were considered ‚Äúcool‚Äù and mainstream
Carmelo Anthony will be forgotten except as a trivia question a few years after he retires.
"Well, that‚Äôs the point. AD‚Äôs career *isnt* ending right now. Whereas for all intents and purposes‚Äî-legacy wise‚Äî-Dwight‚Äôs career had ended by now. He fell off a fucking cliff by year 10. AD and Dwight both have equal all star appearances. So just think about that. AD could project to having a Duncan/kg amount of all star appearances.  Imagine how insane a drop off it would take for AD to never make another all star appearance, which is what it would take for him to stay on par with Dwight.   And Dwight fell off with no major injury! I‚Äôm not hearing the back as an excuse for Dwight bc he still had athleticism to spare. He lost a little explosion and quickly got exposed for his lack of game. That matters when talking legacy.   His lack of game, that brings me to the main issue I have with this Dwight revisionist history thats going on ever since he wasn‚Äôt added on the 75th: Dwight was closer to Ben Wallace, Alonzo morning than he was Shaq, Hakeem, wilt, etc . Let alone David Robinson, Moses Malone. Like let‚Äôs calm tf down. He was never on the pantheon of great centers. Career high was 22ppg. Averaged 20+ only 4 times in his career. So let‚Äôs get that out the way, bc the way younger cats talk about him as if they think he was one of the classic 27+ ppg  dominant 2-way centers. **He was not**  The next part is the rewritten history of how good the magic were. They had four 50 win seasons in his 10 years there. The finals we all know, and an ECF trip. That‚Äôs it. And yes, AD never took a team that far, but let‚Äôs not act like Dwight was out here doing carry jobs left n right. He had the same type of fringe success as a #1 option as‚Ä¶Alonzo mourning. Reggie Miller‚Ä¶dame Lillard‚Ä¶Carmelo Anthony. These are all guys who are at the back end of the list. All guys who did not get rings in their prime. No MVPs. That sets your level.    AD? Got a ring in his prime. We can be mad all we want that he got it by way of joining with Lebron, but that‚Äôs a moot point . He got it, so he has higher cache. He and Dwight are not on the same level.   Anyone can be an all star and/or make a finals. It‚Äôs the next level accolades that sets you apart. AD has a ring. Russ has the MVP. Harden has the MVP. All of these guys are on a higher echelon than Dwight for that reason."
"It‚Äôs pretty sad that a lot of us absolutely casual fans realized this roster was bad before the season started. How on earth did Pelinka think an injury prone 36 year old LBJ, old bad Westbrook, Anthony Day to Davis, old vets like Carmelo, Dwight, and Rondo‚Ä¶would make a title contender? Was he just hoping all these guys would stay healthy? It sucks because LBJ was never injury prone until he hit around 34. But at this point, he‚Äôs missed significant time due to injury. They have no perimeter defense and they‚Äôre one of the oldest teams in the league.   Again, just not sure what Pelinka thought. I get LBJ might‚Äôve convinced him but at some point you gotta override a 36 year old who‚Äôs missed the majority of the last season and relies on other to take his minutes due to his age and previous injury history."
"Basing it off the people who were voting on this list it's a pretty fair thing to say. Just like how in the original list there was super heavy NYK bias, which is how guys like DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas, and Earl ended up on there over some significantly better choices.   There's just a wild amount of conflict of interest with the voters in this, including some guys who were on the damn list. Not so much a decree of Magic Johnson and the ghost of Dr. Buss appearing at Adam Silver's bedside and singing I Love LA until he made AD get in.  to be fair: I think AD probably deserves to be on that list more than Carmelo Anthony, Dame Lillard, and Paul Pierce. But I don't think that's a common belief among fans or players or coaches."
"If Carmelo Anthony wasn't balling tf out, they'd be like 3 games under .500 right now lol"
Queue Carmelo Anthony lying in the floor as his teammates continue playing around him.
"I agree with him and I'll try explaining it how I think of it. Anthony Davis is a top 5 talent in the league, maybe provides top 5 value in the league when he's on the court, but he isn't a top 5 player in the league. It's somewhat hard to distinguish those from each other.  When he's on the court his numbers don't ever not look good. He has an unbelievable midrange game, he can run the floor, catch lobs from anywhere, and then on defense clamp any 4 in the game, play great defense on most 5s not named Jokic or Embiid, and play elite help defense.   But there is something that is critically lacking in his game and it's hard to pinpoint. It's too clich√© to say killer instinct, or heart, or silly sports platitudes like that. But AD is very evidently a player who can just will you to wins night in and night out. At times it seems like he doesn't even want to do that.   It's not normal for a player who is putting up 28/12/2/1.5/2 on 50% from the floor to miss the playoffs. It isn't normal for someone to put up those numbers and only get to 34 wins in a season, and especially because AD is clearly not a ""great stats, bad team"" guy. He's not an empty stats guy which is very much what KAT feels like right now. He can get those stats on a championship level team all the same, and give you valuable possessions on both sides.  A team with Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, sniper years Ryan Anderson, some ok but not very good guard/wing back ups like Toney Douglas, Tyreke Evans, Tim Frazier, James Ennis, and then some solid back up bigs in Ajinca and Asik shouldn't be 12-26 at the All-Sat break if you're the best player at your position in the league.   James Harden as a 23 year old pulled a starting 5 of him, Chandler Parsons, Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, and Dontas Montejunas to 45 wins and took OKC to 6 games; and that was with Kevin McHale as coach. Then half that damn Pels team ended up going to Houston eventually too.  KG's running mates were Terrell Brandon, Wally World, Anthony Peeler, and Rasho Neserovic and he pulled into the playoffs in an even more competitive West.  Hakeem didn't have a single All-Star with him as he kept making it to the playoffs each year in the West.   Dirk the same thing, he took a team to the finals and lost in 6 (refs willing) that was starting Jason Terry, Josh Howard, old Jerry Stackhouse, and Erick Dampier.  Jokic won a playoff series last year against a high-powered Portland team with his top 4 guards out, one other guy who could score but not defend, and then a mix between 5'9"" rookies, just signed players, two way guys, and the reanimated corpse of Paul Milsap. This year without MPJ and Murray, and now Barton, Jokic is leading the Nuggets while putting up even better numbers and a top 10 defense...and they will sail into the playoffs.   But with Jrue Holiday and a bunch of 3pt marksman, Anthony Davis had years where he didn't even sniff the playoffs.   That just isn't normal. If you put any of these other guys on that team they're going to find a way into the playoffs, even if it's the 8 seed, even if they get swept. They're certainly going to win more than 30 games.   I think it speaks to Anthony Davis at his core is just a right hand man type of player. He may very well be the best ""2nd option"" of all time. He's this generation's Scottie Pippen who people sometimes even have as a top 5 player in the 90s. But AD just doesn't have that drive in him, or the specific skill, or desire, or whatever it is, to pull teams to wins. Pull them into the playoffs. Just find ways to get it done and get there. He isn't that guy...even though he obviously has all the talent in the world to do that, and has always put up numbers that SHOULD do that.   I mean damn even Carmelo took a team with a guard rotation of Pablo Prigioni, Ronnie Brewer, Raymond Felton, and a 39 year old Jason Kidd, 7ppg Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith, the decayed husk of Kenyon Martin, Steve Novak, and Tyson Chandler to round 2 of the playoffs. And Carmelo is not a better player than AD, whatsoever, in any way. But he is the kind of guy who is a bonified #1 option, who has the drive and will to just find wins and go for broke trying to get them in a way AD doesn't.  AD kind of always seems like he's holding back a little bit. The other night vs. I forget who, but AD was red hot the entire game and WB was...not, and to take the game winning shot what happened? They ran 1-4 flat with Westbrook who took a contested 30ft 3 and bricked it. AD was standing in the corner just watching it.   Now you could say that has something to do with coaching, and maybe it does, but not even Vogel is that bad. It's not like this was some misdirection play or a match up thing either. Also if you're that guy, if you're an All-NBA 1st team player, if you're this HOF two way incredible 30ppg dude...you should be demanding that shot. Especially when you are just draining jumpers all night. But he didn't, and that isn't the first time he's seemed to shy away from pivotal moments like that.   So in that sense AD is a ""very good"" player, but not a great player. He's an absolute incredible talent, incredible scorer, incredible defender, easy choice for the HOF. but as a ""player"" there is something that is critically missing from him. Something that you can find in almost all of his All-NBA 1st team peers from LeBron, to Jokic, to Embiid, CP, Dame, Curry, Doncic, Harden, KD, Butler, Trae, Morant, Mitchell there are so many of these guys who have that extra part of them. Even guys who haven't been All-Stars like Jamal Murray, Fox, Ant, Bogdanavich(s), grab hold of that moment more willingly and firmly than AD.  I mean good lord it's in Russ--that's half the reason he's so good at basketball--but AD should be the person taking that situation every single time. Not just over Russ but maybe over LeBron most of the time too. That's how good he is. Not just a single shot but just down the stretch in general.   AD is going to be one of the 5 greatest talents of this generation, and he's gonna pick up a lot of hardware, but there is just such a distinct generation between him and these other HOF peers of his when it comes to drive and will to win. Maybe AD is just apathetic, maybe he doesn't care that much and is just insanely good at basketball, I mean he is notoriously lazy about his workouts in the offseason which also isn't normal. I don't know. But there is absolutely something to it."

"I see the spurs as halfway trying to rebuild and it's clearly not working. Just blow it up. What does that mean exactly?  \- Tank and get a top 3 pick. This season and next.  \- Weaponize your cap space to accept contracts to get picks. Remember when Melo was on the hawks? That's because the hawks used that exact strategy and it worked for them, obviously. https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/8/9/17671374/carmelo-anthony-hawks-jersey  \- Collect assets. FRPs. Don't go full Presti, but get something. You might even be able to trade for an all-star 3 years from now with those assets.  Right now, your talent level is too low. You're basically shuffling deck chairs on the titanic. You need better young talent to build around, players who are projected to be more than role players."
Carmelo Anthony Davis.
Don‚Äôt forget Carmelo Anthony
How Lebron the best from the bench? Carmelo Anthony more valuable to the Lakers rn lol
"He's a stat player same with Carmelo Anthony.  He'll give you good numbers and be one of the best scores in the NBA. But he'll never get you over the hump and win titles. They've had good supporting casts and it's not an excuse to say he didn't have a superteam. If you can't even get out of the 2nd round consistently let alone a title what makes you an all-time great.  Iguodala saying Kyrie is a top 3 PG ever because of his ""talent"" is ridiculous. Vince Carter has a better highlight reel maybe more than anyone and is a top 25 scorer ever(highest scorer all-time to not make the NBA Top 75). But that's like saying he's a top 5 player in his position because nobody could jump over dudes like he could."
When asked who he modeled his game after growing up he answered Carmelo Anthony. For real...  Hes even following him on the winning Olympics path
Atlanta Hawks Carmelo Anthony  Roll out of bed 20 and 10 Jah Okafor
"The former DPOY is the one many call an offensive liability and doesnt deserve to be all star. Hes not longer the same offensive player he once was. The former #1 pick is called a bust by many. Who's the other top 10 picks? I swear if you say Iggy and OPJ youre clueless. Iggy is freaking 37 years old and OPJ is no longer the same player he was.  If youre talking about the past Lakers have a former MVP, a top 10 player in the league few years back, Carmelo anthony was a top 5-10 player last time as well. Not to mention Deandre Jordan and Howard, who were both all stars. Realise how dumb that sounds?"
Carmelo Anthony called overrated.  Dude is a human highlight reel.  9th on the all time scoring list.  One of the most respected amongst fellow players.
Carmelo Anthony is Melo.
fair point but who do you want in March and April?  Jason Tatum or Carmelo Anthony?
Well if that's not a top 75 accolade then Carmelo Anthony doesn't belong on the list either
"Darko  millic is a floor raiser. Drafted and his team wins the next year. What a legend.   Kyrie obvious reasons. Karl Anthony towns. Looking like Zion as well   Carmelo Anthony prime caused a lot of friction.   Russell westbrook.  The 2000s top of my head Kenyon Martin, Tracy McGrady could of been bad luck as well,"
"do you hear yourself?? Fuck no I wouldn‚Äôt give two shits if someone with the initials KD was called KD, it‚Äôs their name. Lamelo‚Äôs Instagram is literally Melo and he‚Äôs one of the most followed young athletes. This new generation of kids and fans knows him as Melo. Carmelo Anthony even gave him his blessing to be called Melo. So if CARMELO is okay with it why does a troll on the internet care so much"
"I would recommend finding a specific thing (team, city, player, history, personal thing) that you really gravitate towards to help create fandom. For example, before I loved the NBA and was playing basketball, I was a big fan of Carmelo Anthony and what he accomplished at Syracuse. So when he was drafted *boom* I was a Denver Nuggets fan.     So think to yourself, what city do you live in? Do you have a favorite player? Is basketball big among your family/ friends? If you're from outside of the US does your country have a star player (ex. Giannis with Greece, Jokic with Serbia)? Find a connection and build a fandom around one franchise from that.  To get into stats and general knowledge the biggest two things I recommend genuinely is fantasy basketball and the 2k games. Fantasy basketball gets you (almost to an unhealthy extent) obsessed and knowledgeable about all the players stats. You can join leagues of random people through Yahoo or ESPN, and it's generally a fun experience. As far as 2K same idea but this way by playing with lots of different teams through the various gameplay modes you will build a knowledge of current rosters.    Once you build on these (for enjoyment, these are fun and shouldn't feel like work) you should find some way to become knowledgeable about the game and the current conversations. ESPN, BleacherReport, Hashtag Basketball, FiveThirtyEight, The Ringer, The Athletic, and The Players Tribune are some good examples. I would recommend reading books like Eleven Rings or The Book of Basketball.    Then finally of course there is reddit. Read through r/NBA on the daily, join your teams subreddit, and then just engage in the comments. You'll quickly learn after all of this, and in the most fun way possible, no one actually knows what they're talking about."
Not that I know of. Right now highlighting Carmelo Anthony from his Lakers debut. Love this.
"Surely you don‚Äôt mean CARmelo Anthony? Because that‚Äôs also just his name, not a nickname. Shit I guess you gotta ban all league use of mike, Larry, wilt (nickname for Wilton), Ben, Rick, bill, Tim, and many others.   Or just stop being an absolute moron.  Cant use your own short version of your name if there‚Äôs ever been a player better than you. In fact, you have to be better than them as a rookie or you‚Äôre forever banned from using short versions of your own name."
Can we save Melo for Carmelo Anthony?   Just call him LaMelo. That's literally his name.
&gt; You can't form a conclusion on who is better right now based on current sample size and there's no reason to suggest that either player's difference vs career is due to an actual improvement vs variance.  Allow me to reiterate:  &gt; Let me just ask you this: Why? What statistical analysis suggests that the most recent ~1 season of data isn't as reliable of a sample as the entirety of a player's career for predicting performance in the near future? This is a massive claim you're making that I'm not sure you quite understand the ramifications of. Like you need papers to support this.  One thing we can say though is that Carmelo Anthony has factually been a better offensive player for the past year. Which is pretty definitive.
"As much as I like Knicks legends Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter, having them on the court together is just begging the other team to run absolutely wild on your team's defense."
In what fucking world does 36 year old Carmelo Anthony play 28 minutes and Gary Trent Jr plays 18.  What the fuck.
"If you ask New Yorkers why they've watched any Knicks basketball at all in the last 20 years, some may say Carmelo Anthony, others may say Allan Houston. A true trooper would say Mindaugas Kuzminskas. But the real answer is Mike Breen and Clyde Frazier. They're the reason Knicks basketball have even remotely been watchable, and I hope our franchise can win this pair of legendary announcers a championship before they pass away."

I found nyk carmelo Anthony handsome
"Honestly i would you agree with you if it weren‚Äôt for this simple point: some star names belong to players already. Like the nickname ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù already belongs to Carmelo Anthony but we‚Äôve somehow given it to LaMelo ball for no reason, and to top it off he‚Äôs only a rookie compared to Anthony‚Äôs decades of experience!  just my opinion though"
I remember last season a ton of Carmelo Anthony stans were brigading the comment sections of YouTube videos and Twitter posts complaining about how he wasn't getting enough touches and that Dame and CJ were hogging the ball which was causing the team's struggles. We were 3rd in offensive rating btw.
Just like Melo is Carmelo Anthony!  The disrespect is unreal
Thank you. This gets to me the most. Melo is and always will be Carmelo Anthony and I will never accept any different.
"PG: Westbrook, SG: Kobe Bryant, SF: Carmelo Anthony; PF: Blake Griffin; C: Nene  I think they will dunk a lot"
"LaMelo Anthony, Carmelo Ball"
"Yeah and if you ask me, the nickname ""Melo"" belongs to Carmelo Anthony. To your point, he's been in the league much longer than LaMelo Ball."
Yeah I wish people would stop calling LaMelo Melo because I feel like that nickname already belongs to Carmelo Anthony.
I‚Äôm used to 2020 headlines so I swear it was gonna read ‚ÄúCarmelo Anthony has passed away‚Äù lmao glad I‚Äôm wrong
"AD is more of a graceful gliding player, he makes everything looks smooth, like Carmelo Anthony. LeBron has always been about that burst, powering through the lane, leading a fast break, etc. LeBron has to conserve energy all the time because when he uses it he's going 100 mph. AD never seems to be at 100, so he doesn't have peaks and valleys like LeBron does."
Carmelo Anthony is cringe

"Dwight Howard. The only argument for Carmelo Anthony is ""muh 25 PPG!!!"" Howard was better at his peak, led more successful teams, and racked up better accolades."
"It would be very much like the trade for Carmelo Anthony and the trade for Stephon marbury. You take a team that isn't ready to compete and trade upside assets for a depreciating asset. The Knicks got lucky with Carmelo and had one interesting season.  And just to head off the responses I anticipate... Yeah, the Knicks have some interesting young players. Robinson, Barrett. They have a couple of picks from Dallas. They still don't have any top 50 players unless you want to ignore the rest of Randle's career and judge him solely on this season with no expectation of regression. You don't trade for a second-tier star unless the move puts you up into the upper echelon of teams. The Knicks would still be lacking two or three starters, and that's without considering what they have to give up to acquire this player."
"Well, mostly because the 1 idiot Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe voted for Carmelo Anthony in 2013 when literally every single other vote was for Lebron. Bum just wanted some attention. Someone else correctly also said that Shaq was robbed of it earlier on as well"

No because ‚ÄúMelo‚Äù is and always will be Carmelo Anthony  &gt;why don‚Äôt either one of these players change their name to avoid confusion?  Why should Carmelo Anthony change his fucking nickname of the last 18 years for a guy who has played 25 games and started 5 of them? Delete this
why would you get confused? Melo is Carmelo Anthony and Lamelo is Lamelo Ball
Nope. Melo is Carmelo Anthony
Type A: Carmelo Anthony
"So at worst they've been dealing with similar missed time problems, but one guy is 13-10 and one guy is 11-14.    &gt; CJ and Nurkic each played 13 games so there isn't much difference in time missed.  Nurkic played 12, and Zach Collins literally hasn't played and plays the same spot.  So our center rotation is Enes Kanter and Harry Giles.    &gt; on-off numbers don't tell you much, because you don't know who else is sitting in that time, if they are playing their entire bench line-up or like to stagger. If their bench unit is better than the opposing bench unit etc.  They tell you a lot.  Our 2nd best player has been either Enes Kanter or Gary Trent Jr for the majority of the season.  We have to play carmelo anthony next to Enes Kanter for significant portions of every game."
"people forget that carmelo anthony was legitimately a great defender. dude had length, athleticism, and motor on defense that gets overlooked by the ""lolknicks"" narrative. its honestly annoying watching people who have never watched melo get blocks and steals like a fiend talk about how bad his defense is and im completely kidding hes trash on defense but hes still the greatest iso scorer ever and needs more respect on his name"
Well at least Carmelo Anthony has played basketball in the last 2 years
"Nah, he's probably still being outvoted by Carmelo Anthony."
"Not Carmelo Anthony to Kristaps Porzingis.  Apparently Melo got his number quickly after KP was drafted saying ""Hi it's Me7o.""  Yes, according KP Melo did have the 7 included."

"It'll be interesting to see what your organization does with that team.  I feel like it may be time to trade KAT and start a rebuild around Anthony Edwards.  Hopefully you guys keep this years draft pick.  I don't think anyone wants to see the warriors with another top pick.    Yeah Randle has been incredible.  I'm not used to expecting to win games, it's been so long since we've been good.  Feels completely different that the Carmelo years too, we can keep building.  Amazing how quick things can change."

&gt; Tmac was a pure scorer more like a Carmelo Anthony  That's a complete myth. TMac was a very good playmaker (he even basically played point in Houston) and a good defender outside a couple seasons in Orlando when his usage was historic.
grant hill could do more and was a better defender. Tmac was a pure scorer more like a Carmelo Anthony type while Hill was a skinnier Lebron. Hill to both.
"Last year the Blazers were so desperate for bigs that they brought in ‚Äúlocker room cancer‚Äù Carmelo Anthony. We started Anthony Tolliver at Center.

The fact that you said AI confirms you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, he had Chauncey, KMart and Camby and other good role players during his Nuggets run.   The reason those teams couldn‚Äôt succeed was because their main go to guy provided average efficiency at best, no defense and no playmaking, he was a black hole on offense. Gasols, Aldridge, Bosh all played winning basketball, played defense and did not suffocate their teams offense whenever they were on the floor."

"People choose not to get to the line IN THAT WAY. Heard player interviews? Heard of Carmelo Anthony? Kobe Bryant? TMac? Everyone on Inside the NBA? People choose not to flop or exaggerate contact and people choose to play in a specific way.  YOU guys are the ones that are laughably naive. Buying into narratives that everyone is a competitor and will do anything it takes to win. Toxic masculinity is a thing OUTSIDE of the top athletic leagues in the world, and is definitely something INSIDE as well. Any of you play D1 college ball? No. You‚Äôre lying through your teeth if you say yes while not believing peer pressure and a certain perspective on how the game should be played are things."

Carmelo Anthony nailing two insanely clutch shots on Easter 2012 against the Bulls
"Maybe we are spoiled, brother! Consummate Pro Mike Gorman and Scal has had his bumps this year but he's still very pro behind the mic. I appreciate the enthusiasm of the Hornets guy, but it sounds like the fucking X Games to me. There is no reason to scream for 20 seconds like that when the highlight of the play was Carmelo Anthony doing the ""Ol√©!"" dance 26 feet from the hoop. I'm pretty sure Tremont Waters could have dunked with that clear of a lane to sprint."

"Carmelo Anthony. Kind of a weird comp, but their stats are very similar, except Barry was an all time ft% guy, and a more willing passer."
"Sacramento and Minnesota? They have literally wasted years and years of draft picks! Sacramento is finally starting to have a semblance of something with Fox and Haliburton, but even Minnasota missed on Lamelo and that was last draft! They are not even in the same ball park as OKC in terms of talent development and super star status. Which teams has had James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George come through in the past decade?   The whole argument of most picks will be mid to late firsts isn't even a thing! They literally could get the 5th overall pick this year! Heck the heat aren't doing too hot right now and could be in the lottery. You think the clippers pick will be in the playoffs next year if Kawhi ditched them this summer? What about in 2026 when Kahwi and PG will be in the latter years of their contracts? Not to mention the fact that Houston's picks for the Westbrook trade don't just end this year. Sure you have the Phionex, Philly and Nuggets protected picks in there, but guess what those picks can be used to leverage trades, get role players, etc. OKC has more flexibility than any team in the league, and they don't have to mortage their future on the present like the nets and clipper have done.   Sure they will have stars come and go and want out at some points, maybe even SGA (he did play in LA afterall) but if that's the case Sam Presti learned his lesson with KD walking for nothing. They either sign the extension or get traded. Presti has proven more than capable of retooling on the fly and drafting well.   Also, OKC was close to making the play in until SGA and Horford went out of the line ups and we started losing a lot, so I'm sure if you add a top 10 pick in there next year they can be right back in the midst of the battle.   Haters just hate because they haven't had as much success as OKC has had since they have been a franchise. I get it they never won a title, but hey 2013, 14 and 15 they were one of the top teams, but they had injuries and 16 they had bad luck. Had everything gone perfect they would've won in 2014."
"Carmelo, not even that close if you remove recency bias...  You gotta understand how perpetually terrible Denver was before Melo arrived. No one gave a fuck about them really, they had that brief playoff run in the early 90's with Dikembe but otherwise going to play there was like a death sentence for players' careers. He had the same effect as Lebron did in Cleveland, but played in the West which was so much more difficult in the 2000s than the East  I like Jokic too, but Carmelo Anthony helped change the culture for the Nuggets and brought them back to the playoffs. Yes, he had a mess of an exit and his lil fight against the Knicks was embarrassing, but he also helped lead them (Along with Billups/AI and role players) within 2 games of the NBA Finals. Denver got to the WCF last year too, but the bubble does not compare to a real playoff series"
Carmelo Anthony for being on the team
"Carmelo Anthony was much better than Paul Pierce, he just didn‚Äôt get to team up with tail-end of prime KG and Ray Allen."
It's funny because Kobe also said Carmelo Anthony was the hardest player to guard.
"His hype was totally real. He was pretty good at offense, while needing to upgrade his defense. I remember him being compared to Carmelo Anthony, and he showed promise during the beginning of his career, but it was derailed by injuries pretty fast and he never fully came back. Blew up his ACL twice, I guess"
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
Carmelo Anthony
"Lol calm down dude you don‚Äôt need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
Carmelo Anthony Davis
&gt;He's a glorified Carmelo Anthony  So you woke up today and chose violence lol  I'll let you have the rest of your day
"Kobe, statistically isn't better than any of the players I just listed. Not even close really. He's a glorified Carmelo Anthony - immensely talented, inefficient scorer for most of his career - except he has rings. And Duncan? Anthony Davis and Jokic are bother better. Duncan doesn't even scratch the top 10."
"While that's true, this same point applies to players like Carmelo Anthony and Anfernee Simons on the blazers, THJ on the Mavericks, Maxey and (to a lesser extent)Dwight on the 76ers, etc. all of them have horrible +/- numbers which hurt the MVP candidates like Luka, Dame, and Embiid when they play."
It won't happen. If OKC didn't buy Carmelo Anthony out or Kendrick Perkins out I would bet that Al Horford will not get bought out either (unless he gives back a significant amount of money). I would rather him sit the bench all season next year than buy him out and let a contender like Brooklyn get him for free. If you want him that bad trade for him.
Interesting coincidence is that Kevin Durant was the all-star with the least games played that year (broken foot I believe). He might end up being the all-star with the least games played this year as well.  Off the top of my head other major injuries that year to stars were Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony.
probably not sign Carmelo Anthony
Russell Westbrook  Kobe Bryant  Carmelo Anthony   Derrick Rose  Michael Jordan  Tracy McGrady  Tim Duncan  Dirk Nowitzki  Manu Ginobili  Shaq

"I mean, the fact that you post this in response to a 36 year old Carmelo Anthony having a good game pretty much sums it up. But go off, plz"
He's been in trade talks since at least 2016 and it's all blurring together. I remember when the cavs were close to trading him for Carmelo Anthony
At no point was Carmelo Anthony a superstar
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
Agreed but by that definition Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony are still superstars
What has he won?  Nothing.  He has gone from team to team and save for Miami (and any team can get lucky) did nothing noteworthy.  He is like a poor man's Carmelo Anthony.  Who cares if you can score points?  Like Herm Edwards says - YOU PLAY TO WIN THE GAME.
Carmelo Anthony
The Carmelo Anthony traded ended up being the pick that led to Jamal Murray
"The Pistons traded Otis Thorpe in 1997 for an unprotected 1st rounder 6 years in the future, that turned out to be the 2nd overall pick in the 2003 draft, which could have been Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh, but instead turned into Darko."
"Sorry Portland, but if you task 6'7"" 200 lb. Robert Covington and legendary ol√© defender Carmelo Anthony to grab a rebound over one of the best rebounders in the league in a must-have situation, then you deserve to lose."
"All good, I'm just joshing you on the 'literally' thing. The actual point you and the other Nuggets fan were making just caught me off guard because your team is still obviously good, and I was surprised to see Nuggets fans coming off a big playoff win on the road by comparing their roster to a G-League team. Your players are good. They're not as good as the guys they replaced, but I know a lot of teams would take those guys any day -- take it from a guy whose team has been playing Carmelo Anthony at the 5 for some major stretches in playoff games."
"""I got it, fuck outta here"" - ~~Carmelo Anthony~~ Kyle Kuzma 2021"
"All good, gotta get your eyes checked though.  Its also Alex English with 18, not Melo.    Also it was displayed as a list like this  1. Alex English 2. Carmelo Anthony 3. Nikola Jokic  How did you mix that up lol."
"This game really was the ultimate 2021 Portland Trailblazers experience.     \- Damian Lillard splitting the defense to hit wide open wings who proceed to throw up bricks     \- Jusuf Nurkic, knowing his team's only chance of staying in the game is with him on the floor, removing himself from the game by committing a pointless boneheaded foul with five minutes left      \- Terry Stotts deciding the best way to handle Jokic over the final five minutes is by bodying him up with Carmelo Anthony and Robert Covington (!)     \- CJ repeatedly sagging off of Austin Rivers as he drills open three after open three"
Give me 4 more 4th quarters of Austin Rivers vs Carmelo Anthony.
"Exactly what we all came to see, Austin Rivers vs Carmelo Anthony head to head in the clutch"
The Austin Rivers vs Carmelo Anthony duel we all expected
I'm up at 7AM watching Austin Rivers vs Carmelo Anthony and I don't regret it whatsoever
As we all knew this game would come down to a duel between Austin Rivers and Carmelo Anthony
I agree. Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony are such negatives as defenders and even sometimes on offense it's not even funny
"As much as I've loved the energy from the Knicks crowd, Trae's poise and response to them has made me appreciate him a lot as a player.  Meanwhile, Carmelo Anthony is crying to the media about Denver being kinda mean to him, like, come on."
"Context is key here. The 3 players picked after Bennett were Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter, and Cody Zeller. The 3 guys after Darko were Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwayne Wade."
you're the good luck charm! seriously this is the first year the knicks have been in the playoffs since back when they had carmelo anthony in like 2012
"Carmelo Anthony, the phantom spitter!"
"People who just think if you have a rich owner who's willing to spend then that's all you need would be well advised to look at everything the Knicks did from about 2002 up until about three years ago. They regularly had the highest payroll in the league and were no good at all, and it's all because Dolan refused to ever just rebuild, and was insistent if he just kept spending money then he could ""reload"" instead.   What it took him almost 20 years to realize however, is that the truth is the only big name players who are available via trade when you have limited assets to deal are ones who are on questionable contracts. So a rich owner can keep collecting a bunch of high priced guys who are past their prime with big name recognition and even bigger price tags, but that's not how you build a winner. If anything that's more like a great recipe to stay mired in mediocrity, and how you end up with [""super teams""](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17124633/derrick-rose-says-new-york-knicks-being-put-same-super-team-class-golden-state-warriors) like the Knicks one that featured Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, rather than an actual contender."
You better watch out - we might bring ATL Hawks legend Carmelo Anthony back!
"Well just yesterday hundreds of commenters were shitting on a Nuggets fan yelling ""How was New York? You fucking suck!"" to Carmelo Anthony and the Blazers so I'm trying to understand if people agree with this or disagree with this."
"I've also seen plenty of historically great iso players completely ruin any offensive rhythm around them and shoot their teams out of games.  Kobe isos lost the Lakers a championship in '04.  Carmelo Anthony isos stopped Denver from ever having a decent run. Will this happen to the Nets? I highly doubt it . But at the end of the day, last season doesn't mean shit.  What Harden or KD or Kyrie did 5 years ago doesn't mean shit.  This is a new team, they have different roles to fill now precisely *because* there are other superstars on the team. This Nets offense looks formidable, but until they actually play some meaningful games against the top competition, there's no way to judge how the stack up against history."
"I don‚Äôt this doesn‚Äôt directly answer your question, but honestly I don‚Äôt think trae will/could ever reach the ability of Luka. In terms of potential, I see trae reaching Carmelo. Anthony heights and Luka Lebron james heights"
Its kinda funny how when Jabari Parker was drafted he was supposed to be the next Carmelo Anthony and now 6 years later he's arguably worth less than 36 year old Carmelo Anthony

"Bro, what the fuck did Carmelo Anthony do to Denver? üòÇ I know he asked for a trade but I don‚Äôt recall him talking shit about the team or sitting out/playing bad until he got traded."
[Here you go](https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2019-07-12-chauncey-billups-says-carmelo-anthony-cares-more-about-scoring-than-winning/)
"hey, he could have walked in FA, instead they got some assets. people just love to be upset. they still made playoffs as 6 seed after they traded him, and take with a grain of [salt](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2021/2/21/22294042/the-carmelo-anthony-trade-denver-nuggets-new-york-knicks-masai-ujiri-danilo-gallinari):  One can argue that the Melo trade actually set Denver up for even more success than they experienced with Anthony. Two years after the trade, largely behind the play of Danilo Gallinari, the biggest piece they got in return for Anthony, the Nuggets set a franchise record for regular season season wins with 57. They looked as dangerous as any team in the NBA going into April, but disaster struck when Gallo tore his ACL mere weeks before the playoffs. That ended up being the catalyst for the whole thing falling apart. The inevitable rebuild that truly started with the Melo trade came full force the year following Gallinari‚Äôs injury."
"omg, you might be right. I remembering seeing this when it came out and for some reason my mind remembered Carmelo Anthony and I hadn't seen the commercial ever since, so i've always thought it was melo. But yes, this is the one, i think.   Murphy's law for you, right? Post something wrong, and someone will prove you wrong and give you the right answer"
"Jokic has worn 15 his entire professional career, it had nothing to do with Carmelo, who hadn‚Äôt been on the team in years.  Anthony Randolph wore 15 as well."
"‚ÄúFollowing the 2010-11 season, Kenyon Martin, J.R. Smith, Marcus Camby and possibly Chauncey Billups were going to be free agents that were likely to go elsewhere. With Denver planning to go younger, Anthony decided that he did not want to be a part of a rebuilding process.‚Äù  Here‚Äôs an article which tries to see how Denver would have fared if he stayed: https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/4/29/21240429/what-if-carmelo-anthony-doesnt-leave-denver-nuggets-2011-nba-offseason-nikola-jokic-masai-ujiri  So, no, they wouldn‚Äôt have had the personnel to go deep into the playoffs. Specially in the West.  So boo him all you want but boo the rest of the Blazers just as much as you do him..or at least all the other previous Nuggets in the team."
Defensive specialist Carmelo Anthony
i think rivers is a little like carmelo anthony in that you want to use him in short bursts then take him off the floor before he starts chucking bad shots and hurting you
Knicks fans boo'd Melo while he was on the team  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18570450/new-york-knicks-fans-boo-carmelo-anthony-calls-last-week-mentally-draining
"Knicks fans boo'd him when he was on their team. National media could care less about Nuggs after he left, why are they trying to care now  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18570450/new-york-knicks-fans-boo-carmelo-anthony-calls-last-week-mentally-draining"
Carmelo Anthony has stated that the Nuggets were attempting to trade him during the season. He just made certain he was going somewhere that he wanted to play.
"You don't understand the difference between shooting, and being the best scorer. Ppg alone, efficiency alone, don't make the best scorer.  What makes Kobe and Melo better scorers than Durant is their ability to score in every facet. You can force Durant into certain situations.   When players who had to guard these guys say that Kobe and Melo were the toughest players they had to guard, that translates more into how great they were.  *""Kobe (Bryant) and Carmelo (Anthony),"" Durant revealed as his most difficult covers during an¬†ESPN Radio¬†appearance (h/t¬†Royce Young of DailyThunder.com¬†for the transcript). ""They just have an array of moves that can get me off balance. They‚Äôre strong on defense as well, but Kobe is just the ultimate one-on-one player. It would be fun playing against him but it would be tough to beat him.""*    *IF I HAD TO SINGLE ONE GUY OUT WHO IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PLAYER TO GUARD IN THE LEAGUE, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CARMELO. HE‚ÄôS A UNIQUE BLEND OF BEING BIG, STRONG, AND ATHLETIC WHILE ALSO HAVING A WORLD-CLASS SHOOTING TOUCH AND A NATURAL ABILITY TO GET TO THE RIM. THAT‚ÄôS WHAT SETS HIM APART ‚Äî EVERY FACET OF HIS GAME IS ELITE. SOME GREAT PLAYERS WILL HAVE ONE OR TWO PARTICULAR SKILLS THAT MAKE THEM SPECIAL. BUT CARMELO CAN DO EVERYTHING, WHICH PUTS YOU IN A BAAAD SITUATION AS A DEFENDER. A LOT OF GUYS MIGHT SHOOT BETTER FROM CERTAIN AREAS, SO YOU TRY TO FORCE THEM ELSEWHERE ON THE FLOOR. CARMELO DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE A SPOT ON THE FLOOR WHERE HE CAN‚ÄôT CONSISTENTLY HIT SHOTS. IN MY OPINION, HIS COMBINATION OF PHYSICALITY AND SHOOTING TOUCH IS UNMATCHED IN THE NBA. YOU CAN‚ÄôT TAKE ONE SECOND OFF WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE MATCHED UP AGAINST HIM.* - Paul Pierce."
"Jokic is going to be the first Nugget to win MVP. He is going to make 1st team all nba for the 2nd time. Carmelo has 0 1st team all-nba appearances in his career. Jokic also has already had more playoff success as a Nugget than Carmelo Anthony did in his 8 seasons as a Nugget. If you ask Nuggets fans Melo or Jokic, I am sure 95% of them will pick Jokic.  So yeah, Jokic is well on his way to becoming an all timer. And in the eyes of Nuggets fan, he is already ahead of Carmelo"
"Its the same with 80% of the scorers.  Steph Curry is BY far one of the worst defenders.  It's not just Booker and Young.  Its also, Kanter, Glen Robinson 3rd, Bagley 3rd, DeRozen, etc. There are plenty of players who are horrible on defense.  Oh yeah, no worst defender list would be complete without Carmelo Anthony at the top of the list."
"&gt;Reminds me of an old Carmelo Anthony commercial lol.  Takes off his super-tight spandex shooting sleeve to reveal 80lbs of fat?  (Sorry this is about the old ""Melo is fat"" (compared to LBJ) trope)."
"Portland had a lot more issues. Nurkic alone missed 66 games, let alone Rodney Hood tearing his Achilles (and missing half the season), Trevor Ariza missing half the season, Zach Collins missed nearly the entire season, etc  I mean their starting frontcourt for most of the season was Kent Bazemore, Carmelo Anthony, and Hassan Whiteside and they still managed to make the playoffs."
Game 7 in the finals and he takes off his shirt to reveal he has been wearing an 80lb weighted vest this entire time. Reminds me of an old Carmelo Anthony commercial lol.

"If Melo had Kobe's competitive drive and supporting cast he would be considered one of the greatest players ever.   He was undeniably the most clutch player of his generation. https://www.82games.com/gamewinningshots.htm  https://sports.yahoo.com/game-winners-carmelo-anthony-more-042017684.html  At his prime, his size, speed, and wide array shots made him ungaurdable. Despite playing on largely garbage teams where he was practically the only offensive option he was able to shoot relatively efficiently.  (For reference his eFG and TS are effectively equal to Kobe's. Yes I know Kobe was not exactly a paradigm of efficiency but not everyone can be Jordan.)   People like to criticize his defense, which is justified, and his passing, which is not justified.  It simply a matter of fact that for the majority of his career he did not have anyone to pass to.  If you look at his career highs for assists they are 15-16  when he had KP, and 06-07 when he had AI.  His career low (in his prime) was 12-13 where his number 2 option was JR Smith.  Like yeah no shit he didn't want to give up the rock so JR could chuck up a 3.  His defense on the other hand was never consistent.  I place this mostly on motivation, when he tried his size and speed made him quite effective.  Maybe he was gassed from being a one man show on offense but it really seemed like a motivational problem. He always played better D in the post season and against other super stars.  Tl;dr Melo is undoubtedly going to be a HOFer because he was an incredible weapon on offense. He is unfairly criticize for not passing to the shit teams he played on.  His inconsistent effort on D is the reason he will never be considered one of the greatest."
"Carmelo Anthony was the turning point for our franchise, I still remember when we drafted him and how we started competing for the playoffs immediately, it also coincided with the switch to the powder blue colors, we owe a lot to the current position of our team to Melo."

"I have to say, Melo made me change my opinion of him the way he balled out for us after he signed. He shook off the negative perceptions about him being washed and a locker room cancer and changed them. So much so, in fact, that the first year with the Trail Blazers that [he won the team's Maurice Lucas Award](https://www.nba.com/blazers/carmelo-anthony-named-recipient-2019-20-maurice-lucas-award), with this quote from GM Neil Olshey:  &gt; ‚ÄúCarmelo‚Äôs selfless attitude and leadership on and off the court make him an ideal recipient of this year‚Äôs Maurice Lucas Award,‚Äù said Olshey.  I would bet you $1,000 that if I told /r/nba during the 2018-19 season that Melo would not only be back in the league, but he'd thrive and be considered a *selfless leader* I would get clowned out of the sub. I think a big part of why it worked was because at the time we needed him as much as he needed us, so we built that trust and team atmosphere because both parties needed things to work out.  I'm proud that he's on the squad. He may not show up in every game, but not for lack of effort, and when he's on he's fucking *on*. He's a big part of our recent success (Dame can't do it alone) and I hope he finishes he career here, maybe even with a ring."
"&gt;You people expect players in their prime to just wait it out and HOPE an organization gets it together.  [I think it's weird that you think its' weird that fans expect the top 5 draft picks their franchise selects will help them win a title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1iV24hL8Rk&amp;t=9s)  I *also* think it's weird that you think New York did a better job of surrounding Melo with talent than the Denver did and while I don't blame you for not watching Knicks games, it definitely betrays that you did not watch Knicks games when Melo was there.  &gt;Loyalty is irrelevant in a capitalist world.  That's perfectly fair, but then let's not pretend that Carmelo Anthony is a winner when he's not.  He chose the money, twice, and as a result has had a *very* lackluster career which is why he has to come off the bench in Portland at this stage while guys in his class like CP3 and Lebron are still starting for championship contenders.  This Melo revisionist history to make him some kind of player he's not needs to stop right now.  He was a good scoerer and that was it. Full stop."
Jamal Murray is not better than Carmelo Anthony
According to this article he requested a trade [article ](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2013/3/13/4098522/carmelo-anthony-return-denver-knicks-nuggets) to add to that his want to go to New York served as a sort of no-trade clause the same way Anthony Davis wanting to go the Lakers did the same.
But like... For real... Carmelo Anthony is a top 10 scorer in NBA history. It doesn't get a lot bigger than that.
Dude you're the one not getting it. You can say that to someone who hasn't decided yet on what to do like Zach lavine has an option to stay to Chicago or go somewhere else. But Carmelo Anthony has decided at that time to go to New York. Going back to sign with Denver is not an option for him. Okay?
"I think of wings as forwards, especially the SF position. Although they are fairly solid with the PF position right now, with Robert Covington and Carmelo Anthony, the SF position is pretty much vacant in the 8-man rotation they are running-- they have kept a three-guard line-up (Powell, Lillard, McCollum) with McCollum taking the point when Lillard sits and bringing in Simons, yet another guard."
The way he went about it was less reasonable than the mere fact that he made the request.  -I take my hat off to myself for dealing with all this stuff that's going on and still be able to go out and play at the high level.    Carmelo Anthony

#CARMELO ANTHONY IS A BAD MAN
Remember when Carmelo Anthony played for the Nuggets
let's go Denver  Can't wait for Carmelo Anthony to blame the Portland organization for having no gameplan for him on a 0-4 first round exit
"Said in an interview that the world hasn‚Äôt seen Playoff P yet as a joke, then went on to underperform in the playoffs and lose in the first round alongside Russel Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony.   Next year he had an MVP type year but once again underperformed in the playoffs and lost in the first round. This time it was a little different because he was battling shoulder injuries.  Then last year he was very inconsistent and was the main reason the series against Dallas went 6 games (aside from Luka playing amazing). When they went up 3-1 vs Denver it seemed he had begun to hit his stride but they ended up blowing a 3-1 lead and he and Kawhi played terribly in game 7 (even hit the side of the backboard).   Again it‚Äôs debatable why he played so bad, he claims poor mental health reasons due to being isolated by family and the beef that has sprouted between his sister and Damian Lillards sister."
"2004 9th seed blazers vs 8th seed nuggets. Carmelo Anthony was a rookie that year. And blazers made the playoffs 21 straight seasons prior. Also if the blazers got the 8th seed that year, they would play the Timberwolves who were number one, and the blazers own the season series against them 3-1 that season. Being they only team that season to beat the wolves 3 times. And in the second round, blazers would play the Sacramento kings, which the blazers also own the season series 3-1. Again being the only NBA team that season to beat the kings 3 times. Then in the wcf, they would play the Lakers who has Shaq, Kobe, Payton and Malone. The blazers tired the season series 2-2 that season and Lakers haven't won in Portland in the past 4 seasons prior to that."

So I'd say the difference is a superstar can be the best player on a championship team. Now there are examples in history of superstars not pulling through but that is where the line of subjectivity lies.

"the cavs and particularly Anthony Bennett is a huge gold star for my idea to guarantee every year that a lower lottery pick (8-11th in their conference) is getting the first or second pick every year because if Anthony Bennett goes to a team that isnt going to die without him, like Darko to the Pistons, then maybe there isnt as much pressure around his name. i dont think Darko had a #2 overall career, certainly not better than Carmelo, DWade Bosh etc who came after him but  i dunno; i mean if you took Darko 28th, like where the Pistons should have been picking maybe, then youre happy with what you got? and when Bennett went number one, correct me if im wrong, but Bennett was the year before Wiggins? and the Cavs losing 20 in a row at that time was not shocking? so they needed to hit on that pick, but unfortunately it was the 2013 class. but then, the cavs could have sent him to the gleague to get some reps or traded him sooner or just traded down and took fucking anyone else. i wont say they ruined Bennett bc i dont think he's that good or had that much potential. it might have been cool if they traded the pick to the spurs or something, let him play behind Duncan, take some pressure off the kid."

Pretty sure Amare had no issues with Lin. It was JR Smith and Carmelo Anthony.
Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony agrees he's my GOAT
Pierce has nearly twice the career VORP of Carmelo.  He has 13 seasons with 3+ VORP and Anthony has 4.  He was absolutely better than Anthony statistically.
Carmelo Anthony does not deserve to be in the hall of fame at all. Sure great scorer but poor defender. Never played in a finals and the year his Nuggets teams made the WCF he was the 2nd best player on the team. I will admit he should have won ROY over lebron but he is not HoF worthy.    Also Tim Duncan is better than Kobe.
"Lowry currently has an ~85% chance of making the HoF according to bball-ref. Which would give him the 11th highest chance of active players.  Lebron, KD, Chris Paul, Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis and Carmelo are basically locks. (All higher than 98%)  Then Dame is next at 90%  Then Lowry. And he will still add to his legacy and stats, so I'm assuming it's going to be a lock.  (Paul George, Kyrie, and Kawhi are the next 3, all above 77%)"
"Love his game, clearly one of the most versatile scorers we've ever seen. To be fair, I haven't watched enough tape on him (as in tons of games from every phase of his career) to give a super in-depth deep dive like I can with the other guys I talked about.  The one knock that I always hear from other people that watched him play live was that his defense was non-existent and I know that what I've seen personally, as well as the advanced stats back that up.  I think maybe a good comparison would be someone like Carmelo Anthony? A multi-faceted scorer that goes down in the top ""points total"" players of all time but had glaring weaknesses and a lack of playoff success throughout their career - I know the farthest he got was the conference finals one time.  I would say that he would slot into a teams composition as a scoring machine better than say someone like Adrian Dantley though who put up the numbers but was a complete ball stopper. So if I had to put him somewhere (I've only ever really sat down and hashed out my top 50), it would probably be in the 50-60 range (definitely closer to 50) with guys like Parish, Moncrief, Lanier, probably Worthy would go there as well."
Carmelo Anthony 50 point game only using jumpers with a 65 FG%
"Have injuries not messed up his career though? He‚Äôs one of the most fluid, dynamic players in the league and he‚Äôs old man. Most of his contemporaries have gotten a ring, but he still hasn‚Äôt. Carmelo Anthony should have gotten one too. It‚Äôs just brutal imo."
"&gt;how come that hasn't happened every other time we've had players throw fits, demand to be traded, and refuse to play or say they were injured?  Generally players in recent years who have requested trades have been pretty polite about it. Mostly they don't throw fits or say they were injured  AD asked for a trade but wanted to keep playing for the Pelicans, they were the ones that wanted to keep him.   Harden asked for a trade but was happy to keep playing (at least at first), and then while he started getting annoyed on the court he kept playing. That was also because the Rockets were trying to convince him to stay  PG asked for a trade in the off-season, but the Thunder seemed happy with that  Butler did throw a fit and demanded out with the TWolves, and apparently did refuse to play once. But I'm pretty sure he kept playing even as things got pretty openly hostile, the Wolves also spent a lot of time trying to convince him to stick around  Carmelo Anthony with the Nuggets he wanted out but he kept playing. It partially just took a minute to get a deal together  Dwight Howard with the Magic was just weird. He kept changing his mind, but I don't think he ever refused to play, and if I remember it right he was basically publicly on the fence about wanting out. He did eventually ask to go, and so they moved him  The only one I think that really fits the profile is Kawhi. And that was about injury which no one really knew what was going on, turns out he was hurt but also didn't want to play. They could have  fined him, but then that would just be doctors arguing with each other"
"I never said he was some great facilitator, now you‚Äôre just putting words in my mouth. You must be out of your mind if you think Carmelo Anthony doesn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúSKILL‚Äù to facilitate. Like you said before, i don‚Äôt need compare numbers to know if someone is good or not. He didn‚Äôt facilitate because he couldn‚Äôt , it‚Äôs because he shouldn‚Äôt. He has the most game winners out of any nba player since he joined the league. He is the one of the most clutch players in history. Who is he going to pass to??? I honestly want to hear a good answer. Amare Staudemire isn‚Äôt going to hit a game tying three, Carmelo Anthony will. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù in comparing his scoring skill. You have to be delusional if you think wade is a better scorer. That‚Äôs straight up crazy. LeBron you could argue. Melos game was made to score, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so great about him. His other skills are bad or lackluster. They fit his game. Who do you think, in the league, could guard a prime melo in the post. Nobody. Not a single person. And if you say anybody then tbh this conversation isn‚Äôt even worth it anymore. Carmelo Anthony does not have to be a great ball handler to be great. He does not have to be a great playmaker to be great. He is already great as he is. He does not have to fit whatever you qualify as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù because everyone knows that he is unguardable. Just because he can‚Äôt dribble like Iverson means that he is a one tricked pony."
"Why make Carmelo Anthony a facilitator when he is a scorer? Why pass the ball to Pablo Prigoni when you can create for yourself and get a good shot that will most likely go in? Its honestly a simple answer. Let Carmelo be Carmelo. He doesn‚Äôt have to pass the ball to be great, he already is. I want you to take the same questions I asked you and replace Carmelo with Kobe. Why make Kobe Bryant a facilitator when he is a scorer? Why pass the ball to Kwame Brown when you can create for yourself and get a good shot that will most likely go in? It‚Äôs honestly the same thing. They both get hate for not passing the ball. But they both are top 5 scorers of all time. We all know Kobe and Melo can both facilitate if they want to. But why facilitate a team that‚Äôs better off letting you be you and score the ball ?"

"Well, I'm someone who thinks Stotts gets waaaaaay too much blame, even if it was time to move on and try something else.  He's got a team with two short guards who aren't good at defense, only one big who isn't unplayable in the playoffs (who seems to be quite injury prone, even though they're freak injuries), and an old Carmelo Anthony as one of the ""better"" wing defenders on the team.  It would take a whole lot of moves to make that team a decent defense.  And with their cap situation, that probably wouldn't happen quickly enough for Hammon to not get massive amounts of shit for not magically improving it immediately."
"The bar for first option on a championship team is incredibly high (you essentially have to be a top 5 overall player in the league). Incredible offensive players (like Paul George, Dame Lillard, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Carmelo, etc.) haven‚Äôt even come that close to winning as a #1 option. SGA‚Äôs shown exponential improvement, but unless he continues ascending to literally top 5 levels, saying he‚Äôs best served as a second-banana isn‚Äôt an insult."

Carmelo Anthony?
"At the time, there was a general consensus that the No. 2 pick was going to be either Darko Milicic or Carmelo Anthony, and folks were quite split between the two. Similar to many, many prospects who've come through over the years (foreign or otherwise), there was the pretty solid belief and expectation that Darko was a gem and monster pivot in the making.   The debate mostly centered around whether you wanted someone who'd proven they could already perform on the big stage (Anthony) or the swift-moving center with A+ potential who may need some time to grow (Milicic was still 17 a week prior to the draft).   To give a feel for how certain of a top pick Darko was, [here's an ESPN The Magazine cover from *before* the draft](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ksezwy34L._SR600%2C315_PIWhiteStrip%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C35_SCLZZZZZZZ_FMpng_BG255%2C255%2C255.jpg).  It's hard to think of a modern parallel because so much has changed in the way we scout international prospects (largely because of failures like Milicic and Nikoloz Tskitishvili). But the Darko hype was somewhat similar to the Luka Doncic draft hype and perhaps the Kristaps Porzingis hype prior. The difference being, teams have since learned to delve much deeper into international scouting, beyond ""this dude's individual workout for us was amazing and he has the body of a Greek god"". Now we often have a better idea of who's *really* going to translate well from overseas when it comes to picking that high (though busts still remain).   [Here's a fun piece on all the pre-draft Darko hype.](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2014/9/24/6841293/rip-hamilton-reaction-darko-milicic-2003-nba-draft)  One way or another, guys like Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were universally slotted outside of the top-3. It was always going to be LeBron James, then Carmelo Anthony and Darko Milicic in some form or fashion.   And for what it's worth, as a Pistons fan, I can say they've received plenty of mockery and criticism for their selection over the years, though it may have been blunted by the fact they won an NBA championship against long odds Darko's rookie year."
"It's the ultimate basketball Butterfly Effect question. The Pistons' offense was oftentimes a mess those first 40 games or so that year. It culminated in a six-game losing streak just prior to the 2004 trade deadline.   Those struggles made their mid-season deal for Rasheed Wallace a little easier to pull the trigger on. *Something* had to change, and fast. I do there there's a timeline where Carmelo Anthony provides just enough of a spark to steer the Pistons away from struggling offensively as mightily as they did. And perhaps, in that event, Joe Dumars doesn't deem Rasheed Wallace worth the risk. I believe there's a lot of ways that Sheed deal doesn't get done.   Without Sheed, the Pistons aren't winning that ring in 2004, with Melo or not. I'm old so I'm not going to hold this against anyone who wasn't around, but I'm not sure folks know just how huge of an impact Rasheed was on the defensive end when he arrived in 2004. It took a couple games but soon that Pistons starting five gelled into this singular, cohesive, defensive whole. Without Sheed, that's not happening.  But even if the Sheed trade *did* still happen, there's still many questions. Tayshaun Prince wasn't just critical for that chasedown block on Reggie Miller. He was critical for his defense on Ron Artest all series, and Kobe in the Finals, and his length against New Jersey. The Pistons' identity was so defensively slanted, I think there's a question or wonder of what they'd be giving up by feeding Carmelo more playing time.   Larry Brown also didn't really care about who you were. Future all-star Mehmet Okur spent a lot of time in his dog house that year because he liked shooting jumpers too much. Corliss Williamson was largely phased out shortly after his Sixth Man of the Year season. It's not hard for me to imagine Larry being completely impatient with Carmelo Anthony's steep defensive learning curve. In which case, I could see him sitting way more than we might expect him to.   I think there's a chance the Pistons still win that 2004 ring with Carmelo. But I also think that'd open up a lot of doors for potential failure. It seems just about everything fell into place just right for that team to win that year, as it currently stands, and I'd be weary of messing anything up.   Then again, maybe he accepts his role super well and everything goes great. Tayshaun still somehow plays all the defense they need and Melo somehow provides the offensive punch they need. It could have swung that way too, I just don't think it would have been quite as neat and tidy as we like to imagine."
"At the time, the discussion at the No. 2 selection almost exclusively revolved around Darko Milicic or Carmelo Anthony. Those two, along with LeBron James, were the consensus top three. Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were both highly regarded, just not considered at the No. 2 slot at the time."
"yep i think they do. if not 3 straight they would‚Äôve got more than 1. and you cannot tell me larry brown wouldn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt played melo, carmelo anthony was too good not to play."
You mean the same team that chose Darko over Carmelo Anthony? Lmfao
Great News! Carmelo Anthony is signing a multi-year extension üòä
Yeah. I had to listen to the fantasy world of people believing everyone on the Knicks ever loved playing with Carmelo jab step Anthony forever cus he wore ironic hats and shit in post game interview. Fans on that kardashians pin up poster shit in the bedroom far too much. Wut can u do
Windhorst insinuated on his podcast that D‚ÄôAntoni really impressed Lillard in the meeting. And why wouldn‚Äôt they get along? D‚ÄôAntoni has coached some of the best offenses in NBA history with two MVP players. The only player I can think that hates D‚ÄôAntoni is Carmelo Anthony and it was because the style of basketball they want to run is completely different. I can easily see Dame pulling off what Harden did in the D‚ÄôAntoni offense.
Blake Griffin/Chris Paul/DeAndre Jordan  and  James Harden/Chris Paul/Carmelo Anthony  &amp;#x200B;  ??  Okay bud
Idk about worst ever.   But I thought lamelo would be trash  I thought Trae was way overrated  I thought the Celtics would be real title contenders in 18? The year after they went to the ECF with Tatum as a rookie   The Knicks would have a chance vs Atlanta this year  Carmelo Anthony was better than Paul George
I am a hawks fan and these constant discussions cause immense pain. This is as bad as somebody trashing hawks legends Omari Spellman or Carmelo Anthony. Don‚Äôt bash one time hawks-hat-wearing Luka and leave our team alone
"The lottery that gave us Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh is way better then 18"

Carmelo Anthony  He‚Äôs the Olympics GOAT. I want him to get one more gold and put his record out of reach for anyone else
Underrated: Chris Childs  Overrated: Carmelo Anthony
"Widely? No way. Melo was the pick there, that‚Äôs all I heard back then. Darko was in the convo but it wasn‚Äôt a consensus pick, it was a complete surprise. We literally had Pistons Melo jerseys printed and worn on draft night lmao.   Rip Hamilton even said: ‚ÄúWhen you got Carmelo Anthony out there, it was hard to pass up on him. I had the same reaction everybody else had."" https://youtu.be/07xEVLEhOsg"
"They also lost Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George."
"We were all very unimpressed with the pick when it happened. We were all expecting to get either LeBron James or Carmelo Anthony and somehow, with the second pick, got neither."
"Hey man, you've got your fair share of franchise legends too!  Guys like Carmelo Anthony and John Wall come to mind"
Olympic basketball without Carmelo Anthony is certainly something. Weird that KLove randomly makes the team but they don't have a spot for an Olympics legend.
I used to call Gallinari our Carmelo Anthony (over the hill 1v1 guy that could get a bucket but shot a litttttle too much for my liking). I now realize I was dramatically underrating Gallinari. Dude has been amazing.
Hawks Legend Carmelo Anthony would like a word with you
"&gt;Of course it does.  Lol no it doesn't. It's not a current list then. It's a career list for active players and so Carmelo Anthony &gt; Luka Doncic  &gt;Right but Jokic will be higher still because he's reigning mvp. These things matter.  That's complete nonsense. The better player is the better player. If it's Jokic, fine. But it's not because he won an MVP. If the voters decided to give it to Embiid then he's better than Luka? No"
&gt;Any team that completely whiffs on a #1 pick (and gets Ben Simmons with another) is going to go through a rough stretch  Unrelated...  but this is why the Detroit Pistons are struggling now.  They picked Darko Milicic without even seeing him play in person over Carmelo Anthony who had just led a team to the NCAA championship.  That one mistake didn't start showing up until 2008-2009.  They passed on Melo because they had Tayshaun Prince at SF already.  That decision cost them possibly multiple championships instead of 1...  and a block buster trade vs the rebuild they entered 2008-2009
"We‚Äôve seen some big market franchises suck pretty bad. The Lakers from ‚Äò14 to signing LeBron were bad (the worst that particular franchise has ever been), the Raptors were perpetually bad until Ujiri got there, the Rockets have stunk it up this year, the Knicks went and sucked for 2 separate 8 season stretches with like a 3 year break in the middle for Carmelo Anthony. But they at least made coherent roster moves and you can see the logic in how their rosters were *supposed* to work. They just didn‚Äôt.  No GM made a slate of selections over a 3 year period that were as incoherent as Hinkie‚Äôs and still kept their job. There was never a world where Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahlil Okafor all were supposed to coexist together on a winning roster. Hinkie was terrific at gathering draft capital, horrible at spending it at the actual draft."
The disrespect to Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony hot off of the bench
"I went to one of those games and sat behind the basket. When Carmelo was shooting FTs a dude kept screaming ""Anthony, crack is wack"". Carmelo actually heard him and cracked a smile at one point"
"You're forgetting [what he traded to get Schroder,](https://www.nba.com/news/carmelo-anthony-trade-hawks-dennis-schroeder-trade-thunder-official?amp=1) you need to go back a step. Presti traded a lottery protected pick and Melo on a one year $25.5 million contract (who was promptly bought out by Atlanta) for Schroder and TLC."
"That's Atlanta Hawks legend, Carmelo Anthony, to you"
The Knicks that were garbage for like a decade before prime Carmelo Anthony forced a trade there? Those Knicks? You see any top 10 players forcing their way to the Kings lately?
I think Carmelo Anthony had a no-trade-clause that he had to waive in order to be traded to the PG / Russ Thunder.
Unless they‚Äôre Carmelo Anthony.
"KG was known for his nasty trash talking, stuff that apparently went over the line.  For example, he apparently wished Tim Duncan ""Happy Mother's Day"" at the foul line, knowing that Duncan lost his mother to breast cancer when he was 14.  Few of the incidents can be corroborated because the people involved don't like to talk about it.  But it's clear that opposing players did not like Duncan at all. Carmelo Anthony once waited to confront KG outside the team bus after the game, until staff and security intervened."
"What do you mean,   Trae had the contract of Carmelo Anthony to play with. Not sure how many HOF players contracts Trae needs to win   /s"
"Carmelo Anthony, unlikeable on the court and not particularly likeable off the court.     Say what you want about KD and his FA choices but at least you can respect him for not being afraid to speak his mind and being an extremely talented player who is a big asset to team success"
Carmelo Anthony died

"If 13 PPG on 54% TS = complete inability to score, then Carmelo Anthony and Rui Hachimura can't score either  He's not a model of efficiency/consistency but him being completely incapable as a scorer hasn't been true since his rookie contract"
Can we have Carmelo Anthony to Team USA please?
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
Because his name is Carmelo Anthony   Jabari Parker wouldn‚Äôt be given the same treatment
"It will be really interesting to see how the Lakers fill out the team. They already have above average 3-point players in Wes Matthews, Alex Caruso, and Marc Gasol, all of whom could potentially start depending on who else they pick up. Here are some of the players I'm guessing they try for:  Buddy Hield (3-team deal, sending out Schroder as a sign and trade)  Laurrie Markannen, (sign and trade Schroder)  Danny Green (MMLE or vet min)  Carmelo Anthony (MMLE or vet min)  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, this is a bit of a replication of the LeBron Heat team. You have two athletic wings who thrive on driving to the basket, and a big who can pop and shoot. Of course LeBron is not the same player he was back then, and Westbrook is no Dwyane Wade --- but AD is much better than Bosh on both offense and defense, but the style of play may be similar, with the Lakers having two wings who can relentlessly attack whether they are both on the floor at the same time, or individually.  I was not a fan of bringing Westbrook to the Lakers, but LeBron and AD were obviously in favor of it, and I assume they know what they are doing. If the Lakers can still add a couple of shooters, as I expect they well, this is on paper the best team in the Western Conference (pending further moves by Golden State)."
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
Bulls Legend Carmelo Anthony
NEWSFLASH: Lakers just picked up All-Star Carmelo Anthony- LETS GO!!
"If you're honestly confusing LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony, that's a you problem lmao"
"Who the hell agreed to using ""Melo"" and not meaning Carmelo Anthony while he's still in the league?"
I‚Äôve actually thought about this before. Worthy players to add IMO  LeBron James Kobe Bryant Tim Duncan Kevin Durant Kevin Garnett Dirk Nowitzki Dwyane Wade Stephen Curry Steve Nash Jason Kidd Allen Iverson Gary Payton Ray Allen Reggie Miller Dominique Wilkins (snubbed last time) Kawhi Leonard Chris Paul Vince Carter Paul Pierce Dwight Howard Carmelo Anthony Jason Kidd Tracy McGrady Chris Webber Yao Ming Bob McAdoo Tony Parker James Harden Giannis Antetokounmpo Russel Westbrook Alonzo Mourning Grant Hill
Definitely more of a legend than Hawks Legend Carmelo Anthony or Lakers Legend Chris Paul
Tell OKC to trade Perkins instead of Harden.  And avoid Carmelo Anthony at all cost.
"But they ""already had"" Tayshaun Prince when they did not take Carmelo Anthony and went with Darko.  It haunts them.  But I say that hoping they keep the #1 and take Cade."
Shout out to Carmelo Anthony who literally drops a percentage if you leave him wide open.
"The Nuggets shot 14/42 and committed 7 turnovers when guarded by Carmelo Anthony  Melo was the best guy on our team guarding Jokic  Melo is still a good interior defender, and has active hands. Off ball he is slow to rotations, but he grinds and ain‚Äôt afraid of contact"
"Carmelo Anthony is on the downside stretch of his career, way past his prime."
**Close to leaving their primes:**  1. CP3 2. Carmelo Anthony  LMFAO

NBA teams stay at The Nines hotel in downtown Portland. It‚Äôs also where Carmelo Anthony stayed for a while when he first joined the team. On my walk to work for the past few years I used to take a different route during basketball season to pass The Nines and catch away teams busses and sometimes see the players. Was pretty cool.
"Cleveland's intern meetings are still revolving around three players for the No. 1 pick in Thursday night -- LeBron James, Darko Milicic, and Carmelo Anthony, sources tell ESPN. Cleveland isn't fully there yet on committing to James with their first overall choice."
"Also in the Carmelo Anthony trade to the Knicks 3 draft picks involved in the trade are recognizable players today. The picks used to select Dario Saric, Jamal Murray, and Jakob Poeltl we‚Äôre all traded in that one transaction."
What‚Äôs the record? Carmelo Anthony never got 48 did he?
"Masai Ujiri has never had a fire sale. When he was forced to trade Carmelo Anthony when he was with the Nuggets, he got a huge trade package. Then two years later they had their best season ever.  When he started with the Raptors, he traded the best player at the time, Rudy Gay, and then proceeded to have the best season ever shortly after.  Masai is always looking to compete immediately. It's not in his philosophy to tank."
Two words: Carmelo Anthony.
Carmelo Anthony
We need to call him...he‚Äôs a hero we need but don‚Äôt deserve....we need international Carmelo Anthony
The Redeem Team was also full of iso hoopers. They turned Carmelo Anthony into a spot up 3&amp;D player and guys made sacrifices to make it work. Wade was a defensive juggernaut while the offense ran through Kobe &amp; Lebron and everyone else checked their egos.   Nobody wants to sacrifice on this squad.
"fun fact: Last time the USA team played in this stadium in 2006, was the only time in history that a super talented USA team lost to more than 100 pts! from an NBA-less Greece team.

"one of the themes that The Wire was going to explore was the prep &amp; AAU basketball circuit to signing w/an agent/endorsements to college/pros and supposedly Carmelo Anthony was considered to act for that script, but it never happened ... probably could be a miniseries now (w/other actors/athletes) anyway"
Don‚Äôt forget hawks legend Carmelo Anthony
"Are you seriously disputing that people were shocked that Detroit selected Darko?? Were you even alive back then?  And to reiterate what I said, yeah, while there were articles on the internet projecting Darko as a lotto pick you gotta keep in mind that majority of people weren't even regularly online yet in 2003. Also, let's not forget Pistons FO [told Larry Brown they were drafting Melo](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/larry-brown-pistons-said-they-were-drafting-carmelo-anthony-in-2003/) and backtracked on it due to one good workout."
"Carmelo Anthony. When I was like 11 or 12, Carmelo dropped 62 in a game and it was the first NBA game I ever really watched. I didn‚Äôt care about the Knicks but it made me love Melo to this day."
Boston is definitely not winning with Carmelo Anthony 2.0 leading the charge ..
What if that player is Carmelo Anthony or Anthony Davis?
Antonio McDyess - 30 points against Portland (2000)    Carmelo Anthony - 40 points and game winner against Cavs (2010)    Nikola Jokic - Perfect Triple Double 35/12/11 against the Suns (2018)
That‚Äôs like the best possible individual season one can have. So somewhere in between Carmelo Anthony and Jonas Valanciunas imo.
"Ive done more of both than most of the pastey suburban kids who populate this sub and can only shoot flat arch 3s at 28%. That's not the point, enjoy your poverty franchise and keep rooting for new age Carmelo Anthony with worse defense and more playoff collapses"
"The author of the article believes that:  &gt; The emphasis on retaining Powell comes from data that shows the starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Powell, Covington and Jusuf Nurkic last season had the NBA‚Äôs fourth-best net rating among starters, behind Brooklyn, the Clippers and Philadelphia.  So they think the starting lineup is fine, but:  &gt; Although Olshey has never publicly admitted it, he knows he failed last season in not recognizing a bench centered around Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter was fatally flawed from a defensive standpoint.   So essentially, they want to keep the starters and rebuild the bench from scratch and hope that's enough."
Marv Albert: Wait now they're saying it's Carmelo Anthony who took Kevin Durant's ball.
Carmelo Anthony Davis Bertans
"Sometimes I feel like we've gotten past the times where Dame was underrated then I see shit like this. I really don't know how you can watch the guy and still feel like this.  Maybe that's it, maybe you don't watch him.  You just watched a team led by Chris Paul/Devin Booker make the finals and you think somehow Dame Lillard isn't good enough to be that lol.  People have a really hard time separating how good a player is from how good their team is. You stick him next to Lebron for a year and people would think he was a god.    &gt; and average playmaker at best.  This is just hilariously wrong.  He was 7th in assists last year.  He was 16th in turnovers. He averaged 10 assists a game on TWO turnovers a game this year in the playoffs. In 2020 he lead a team starting Hassan Whiteside and Carmelo Anthony(with Mario Hezonja 2nd off the bench) to the 3rd best offense in the league.  He's statistically the best pnr guard in the league, and actually set the highest recorded ppp for PnRs in league history.   &gt;  but he is also a high volume shooter.  ...in the last two years he's averaged just under 30ppg on 62.5% TS.  He's one of the most efficient players in the league."

"Saying ‚Äòwell Durant didn‚Äôt get the chance to play the favorites with their third and second best players injured!‚Äô is just a pathetic strawman argument.  If Carmelo Anthony got to play an injured Lakers in 2008 then he might be a champion right now lol. We could do dumb hypotheticals like that all day, it‚Äôs meaningless when talking about all time accolades"
"Is this top 10 active players in their prime or top 10 active players currently?  Cause Carmelo Anthony definitely isn't better than Dame now, but Russ prime isn't better than Melo's"
"*He* didn't lose, his pathetic team did.   &gt; That team around him is underrated  You mean the team that plays Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony, 2 of the worst defensive players in the league, real minutes?   &gt; He hasn‚Äôt got close to the resume and playoff runs those guys you lumped him in with have. Tbh he hasn‚Äôt even had *one iconic run yet.  Not his fault. Are we blaming Luka for not having won a playoff series yet? There's a limit to how much one man can do, basketball is a team game for a reason.   &gt; Tons of players have had games with god-like efficiency and volume. It doesn‚Äôt put you up with the greats.  Dame has been doing what he's been doing for years man, he's gotten better every year. Statistically, he's one of the most clutch players the NBA has ever seen and the only player in the league who is better than him over the last few years, is the guy he lost to this year, Jokic."

"you'll never fuckin' believe this, but carmelo anthony is the most clutch shooter of all time and it's not even close.  every time some journalism outlet does a giant article about clutch scoring, they come to the same bizarre conclusion:  carmelo anthony is the most clutch motherfucker who ever lived. it's crazy. he never really won anything, yet basically every time he's in a position to win, he scores."
Carmelo Anthony. Tristan for his tabloid drama.
"I know this post is a few days old but when I say build around Dame what I mean is stuff like:  A) Wasting time and money on old bums like Carmelo Anthony to ""win now"" instead of developing.. anyone else.  B) Signing CJ to a long, big contract extension shortly after Damian Lillard signed his supermax.  This one is very damaging.  This extension is just now kicking in, despite being signed shortly after Dame signed his supermax.  If Dame forces his way out this summer, they will be left with CJ's extension kicking in and they'll have to find a way to unload him now, possibly giving up assets just to do it because moving contracts like that isn't easy, despite him being a good player.  So not only will it be work to get rid of him they were also robbed of actually getting assets for him a year or so ago.  C) In a ""win now"" move, traded 22 year old rookie contract Gary Trent Jr for Norman Powell who just opted out and is now a FA.  What happens if Dame leaves?  Worst case they just RIP'd an asset, best they sign Norman to a big new deal and try to move him in the future.   We could rattle off examples for days, like how they don't have a 2021 draft pick because they traded it for Robert Covington.  So to respond to your initial statement, which offers a valid point but imo comes to the wrong conclusion.  They indeed did build around Dame, they just didn't do it very well.  It's also worth noting, given CJ's extension following shortly after Dame's that Dame himself very well may have been a vocal factor in this move.  As he was in wasting time on washed up Melo.  It's not something we haven't seen before, if franchises completely give in and essentially make their star the GM of the team it can backfire in the future (ie lebron with cleveland, and I see you with that lakers icon, if they aren't careful them too).  At least with LeBron he might leave your franchise desolate but you get a ring out of it so can't complain too much."
"2020-21: Steph Curry (I'd say KD, but he only played 35 games)  2019-20: Carmelo Anthony  2018-19: Blake Griffin  2017-18: Khris Middleton  2016-17: Joel Embiid (does that count?)  2015-16: Paul George"

"I'd make it NFL level hard. There's a good chance that Philip Rivers doesn't make the NFL hall of fame, whereas his NBA counterpart Carmelo Anthony is most likely going to be a first ballot HOFer."
"You did miss the joke so I‚Äôll explain it. Westbrook, Durant, and harden were already on a team together that lost in the finals to a lebron led team with another top 5 pick from his draft class (in that case it was dwyane wade, in this years case Carmelo Anthony)."
Melo's basketball skill was absolutely being questioned:  https://www.theonion.com/carmelo-thinking-he-would-be-good-fit-on-team-with-gm-w-1828159065  https://www.theonion.com/carmelo-anthony-confident-he-can-still-help-contender-f-1819579948
"LaMelo is a good pick. I'm an old head so I also tune in to see Carmelo Anthony do some jabstep hesi midrange jumpers from the bench. Idk it's just cool to watch I'll never get tired of Carmelo having a hot streak.  Another one would be Marcus Smart, he's fun to watch with some sequences of brilliance in-between. MPJ is fun chaos as well."
"George Karl is the most bitter coach in nba history I don't know why anyone is surprised when he pipes up so that he can get people to buy his book. In this case he's certainly not wrong though, Carmelo had 0 commitment to play winning basketball outside. Everybody that was a young guy on that 2008 Olympic team talked about how important an experience it was in their careers seeing how Kobe worked and yet Anthony remained stagnant for the rest of his career. He never became more than a high usage scorer that would grab some rebounds. He had no passing and no defense. At what point was Anthony an MVP caliber player? Personally I'd say never but that's too harsh, you could certainly point to the two years he averaged 28 PPG but apart from that he's always been below the elite level players"
"https://thespun.com/nba/denver-nuggets/george-karl-has-brutally-honest-comment-about-carmelo-anthony  I mean George Karl is a dickhead, but he's not wrong and this is same sentiment his first coach had that was pretty much removed because of Carmelo.  Remember the defensive coach for the Rockets that had them as one of the top defenses with Mike D'Antoni ahead of the helm? Jeff Bzdelik.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cl74gh/carmelo_anthony_and_jeff_bzdelik_relationship_is/  https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-01-11-0401110204-story.html  So Melo had a poor coach-player relationship with Bzdelik, George Karl, and Mike D'Antoni to start his career. Karl is a known shithead, the other two are well liked and Mike D'Antoni is especially well liked by players and Melo essentially caused him to resign.   The lockout impacted trade deals how? That same trade could have still been offered after the lockout was over, it affected sign and trades not straight up signings."
Carmelo Anthony is unquestionably a first ballot hall of famer and you‚Äôre out here saying ‚Äúwell IF he makes the hall of fame‚Äù
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
[Carmelo ‚Äú Fuck Outta Here‚Äù Anthony](https://youtu.be/Ph_g9esnQdA)
Because Carmelo Anthony is the most wasted potential of any player ever.
"Carmelo Anthony was just so New York. He was an institution, stuck in his ways, stubborn and thought he was the best. He was also mesmerising, special and no other player was quite like him. He also had that quiet assuredness that is so New York. He was New York City, everything about him.  I also think Kevin McHale was very Boston Celtics and in modern times, no player embodied grit n grind quite like Zach Randolph"
"people forget about how difficult Carmelo Anthony was as a player. He refused to play power forward for the longest time to the teams detriment. He also destroyed Jeremy Lin‚Äòs momentum because he couldn‚Äôt stand another player having such a high usage rate. Carmelo never had winning DNA and if he wins with the Lakers, I hope The viewing public never forgets the type of player he was"
"I'm not that high on Barnes. I think that Toronto just made the mistake that Orlando's been making for years becoming enamored with the long athletic tweener forward (fluctuating between the 3 and the 4) types because in theory they do so much. In practice who fits that description and is an all star level guy? Kawhi and Tatum, there's a tier difference between those 2 and then Pascal Siakam, and then theres another drop off in that archetype of player down to Tobias Harris, maybe a time ago Carmelo Anthony and Paul Millsap? I leave LeBron and KD off here (and I really dont feel comfortable with Tatum being in this category either) because they were uber skilled players before they were switchable defensive pieces. They're just so talented and uniquely built that you put them on the floor and build a lineup around them and if they end up the 4 instead of the 3 then youre not mad about it because they're the best player on the floor 90% of the time anyways.  Whereas I feel like over the last 20 years the high energy and high IQ  point guard has been a consistent floor raising guy that you always see on playoff teams. Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Jrue had some bad teams in New Orleans but him too. Go back a decade or more and throw guys like Tony Parker and prime Kidd on there too.  Idk i felt this since draft night I feel like Toronto outsmarted themselves with Barnes. He may end up being a good player and long switchable wings definitely don't grow on trees. I also may end up entirely wrong but I feel like we've talked ourselves into the archetype of Barnes in the mid/high lottery before and it ended up being a stinker pick."
"1) Sure and he was a national champion at Syracuse.  But none of it really matters in the discussion of ""What Carmelo Anthony really achieved as a Knick""  I was under the impression of that being the convo  2) go fuck yourself with that reply"
"It might be more of a guaranteed 10th seed and Kidd/Billups is pestering you in January to trade him or he'll retire  Melo made 2nd round once as a Knick. That year they had an emphasis on him not playing like Carmelo Anthony. He was passing the ball instead of holding it for hours, rebounding and defending. He did great. Even ruined LeBron's unanimous MVP. Dude was fantastic. Really showed a glimpse of what co...Next season came along all that was in the trash and Melo was back to jab-stepping.   Even after they showed him, this extra shit works, all he cared about was his numbers. That's who Melo is. Not the other guy.   That guaranteed 2nd dude is not real. It's who Melo could've been, if he gave a fuck."
"This is a much better argument. But this still seems like an irrational grudge from a bad series with your favourite team.  He can shoot, but since you are discounting that evidence, we'll assume he can't. He was one of the top 10 point of attack defenders in the NBA last season. So while yes, he is bad at team defense, it's usually the case in clutch situations that teams revert to heavy iso-ball play. And in heavy iso-ball play, strong point of attack defense becomes incredibly valuable. See: end of wizards vs spurs second game, where Westbrook defends DeMar DeRozan, a top 5 isolation scorer, on the final possession.  Second, he can playmake. I'm not sure where the idea that scoring is the *only* indicator of offense came from, but it's weird. An assist gets your team points too, and Westbrook is a 3x NBA assist leader. And since late game NBA focuses a lot on iso ball and stopping drives, and Westbrook is 1) one of the best drivers and 2) likely the best passer out of drives, his passing becomes incredibly valuable in the clutch as teams are virtually forced to help and sag off their man to stop him, after which he gets his teammates open shots. And if AD and LeBron are the clutch shooters you think they are, having a guy who can consistently get them good looks in the clutch is *immensely* valuable.  Despite being good on offense, neither LeBron nor AD are strong isolation players, and who's the next best iso player after that - the ghost of Carmelo Anthony? A closing lineup *needs* someone who can create off the dribble, regardless of whether they're the one taking the shot or passing out of it."
"It's more that people just star gaze when they remember the knicks teams and ignore what Phil Jackson was doing to that team.  Like Phil's first year, the knicks starting line up was: Shane Larkin - Iman Shumpert - Carmelo Anthony - Amar'e Stoudemire - Samuel Dalembert  The next season: Jose Calderon - Sasha Vujacic - Carmelo Anthony - Kristaps Porzingis - Robin Lopez  Like when these bad rosters lost games, starting games with guys that would be out of the league in a year, it's easy to blame the guy you remember, because no one remembers Cole Aldrich, Quincy Acy, or Lou Amundson starting and getting significant minutes on a team fans expected to make the playoffs."
"From Karl's [book](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/01/10/george-karl-book-excerpt-furious-george-carmelo-anthony-jr-smith):  &gt; Carmelo was a true conundrum for me in the six years I had him. He was the best offensive player I ever coached. He was also a user of people, addicted to the spotlight, and very unhappy when he had to share it. &gt;  &gt; Wait. There‚Äôs more. &gt;  &gt; He really lit my fuse with his low demand of himself on defense. He had no commitment to the hard, dirty work of stopping the other guy. My ideal‚Äîprobably every coach‚Äôs ideal‚Äîis when your best player is also your leader. But since Carmelo only played hard on one side of the ball, he made it plain he couldn‚Äôt lead the Nuggets, even though he said he wanted to."
It doesn‚Äôt matter dude. Out of 4374 players to ever play in the NBA Carmelo Anthony is number 10 in scoring ALL TIME. 60 is not high on the list. Neither is 30. It‚Äôs just crazy to say otherwise lmao. He doesn‚Äôt have to be an elite defender AND an elite scorer to make top 75 lmao‚Ä¶.
Letting go of hawks legend Carmelo Anthony for sure.
Carmelo ‚ÄúI am 12‚Äù Anthony
"Carmelo ""Age is just a number"" Anthony."
"Aside from what others said regarding bonuses and incentives, there are a few other things.  Morals clause:  I was a sports reporter and the Denver Nuggets gave a try out to Dennis Rodman in 2003/2004.  He could have played with Carmelo Anthony during his rookie season.  But Rodman walked because the Nuggets wanted an out in case Rodman became a headache.    This isn‚Äôt going to appear in a max contract, but it is something that teams might consider.  For example, penalties if a player misses meetings or has conduct ‚Äúdetrimental to the team.‚Äù  Travel lodging:  Lots of players don‚Äôt live in their host city.  They can arrange for the team to take care of housing.  Alternatively, teams might be asked to cover their flights to wherever they need to go that isn‚Äôt part of the team travel itinerary.  This can include everything from charter flights to hotels to cars.  This can add up, especially if a player travels with an entourage.  Physical condition:  This is probably more of a thing in Miami, but they demand players to be in shape.  This can mean a player is expected to be able to perform certain tasks under a certain time.  For example, the Heat require players to do 10 baseline sprints in under a minute.  Players who don‚Äôt meet that requirement can be fined.  How you workout:  Depending on the player, teams might demand you not so certain things for exercise.  This might include riding motorcycles, skiing, or extreme sports.  If you get hurt doing stuff banned on the contract, teams can usually get money back or simply not pay you because it was your fault.  This happens more in the NFL.  What doctors you see:  You can always see other doctors, but this can cause issues.  Teams generally want their doctors saying when you can come back.  See Kawhi Leonard and everything that happened in San Antonio for reference.  Who has final say on a player‚Äôs return is a big deal.  Players generally want guys they trust to have the final say.    This has become an increasingly important issue over the years.  Teams have sometimes too friendly relationships with doctors and that might mean getting a surgery you don‚Äôt need, but will allow a faster return.    This can also lead to players delaying return to heal naturally, realizing they‚Äôre not healing properly, need a surgery, and missing parts of the season.  Illegal substances:  This one is self explanatory.  But in general teams don‚Äôt want you taking shit they didn‚Äôt authorize.  That said, Real Sports on HBO had an awesome story in July 2021 about how roughly 50% of the NBA was on the substance abuse list.  Over 200 players were on the list because of weed in the early 2000s.  Media events:  Players get paid what they do because of media contracts.    They are required to do promotional events.  Sometimes, this means showing up to a children‚Äôs hospital.  Sometimes, that‚Äôs doing media Q&amp;As.    I worked media relations at one point for an MLS team.  We had on player be a dick about signing a ball for a charity action.  We had to remind him it was in his contract and to just sign the ball."
"well it's going to be a new list of 75, rather than adding 25 to the 50 list. But even so, I took a stab at it. Top 25 of last 25 years.    16 Locks (not in order): LeBron, Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, Durant, Nowitzki, CP3, Wade, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Kidd, Nash, Dwight Howard, Iverson and Giannis     7 in the next tier (not in order): Gary Payton, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Pierce and Tony Parker  That means 2 spots left out of: Tracy McGrady, Draymond Green, Paul George, Ray Allen and Grant Hill. I would personally lean towards McGrady and Allen."
"I mean if they do have a ceremony they‚Äôll probably presented as part of their most linked team like they did at the 50th Anniversary:  ‚ÄúRepresenting the New York Knicks, at Forward, Carmelo Anthony‚Äù  ‚ÄúRepresenting the Orlando Magic, Center, Dwight Howard‚Äù  ‚ÄúRepresenting the Cleveland Cavaliers, Forward, LeBron James‚Äù  Sadly, Kobe would be honored posthumously."

"I'd still vote 2004. That roster looks way better in hindsight because you can look at see some heavy hitters on that roster. However, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Amar'e Stoudemire all got the fewest minutes on the team (them and Emeka Okafor, in fact), so the 2004 Team *mostly* felt like it was being run by:  * Allen Iverson  * Stephon Marbury  * Tim Duncan  * Shawn Marion  * Lamar Odom  * Richard Jefferson  * Carlos Boozer  * Rookie Dwyane Wade  *Moreover*, it may be difficult to find another NBA MVP who struggled more to adjust to international competition than Tim Duncan did (the trapezoidal lane, constant foul trouble).   *On top of that*, I think one would be hard-pressed to find an all-star backcourt less conducive to adequately sharing the rock and facilitating an offense than Iverson &amp; Marbury (who combined to average 5.9 assists and 2.8 turnovers while shooting 37.8 and 42.3 percent from the field, respectively (they were also No. 1 and No. 2 on the team in field goal attempts)."
"21 is by far the worst team.  2 top ten players (dame/durant)  2 top 20 players (tatum/booker)  4 top 30 players (bam/jrue/khris/lavine)  and then there is Draymond, Javale, Grant, and Johnson  for reference 16 still had Lowry/Butler/George/Thompson/Irving/Durant/Draymond/Demar/Cousins as all top 30 players, and most of those are top 20.  And Harrison Barnes Carmelo Anthony and Deandre Jordan are better than Grant/Johnson/McGee."
I believe it. As long as you keep Carmelo Anthony away from him
I‚Äôm getting a big Carmelo Anthony vibe from this thread.
Carmelo Anthony
"I think this is mostly true but KD just broke the record for most points scored in Team USA history and the previous record holder, Carmelo Anthony, was indeed widely known and revered for stepping up in the Olympics.  However, that may be because Melo hasn‚Äôt found that kind of success on the NBA with a team and so perhaps his Olympic accomplishments weigh more heavily for his career without an NBA championship."

You think everyone would've figured it out the year we lost 4/5 starters and Dame still carried us to the playoffs.  Or maybe the year we started Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside and still made it.
Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony on the left side of the court
Learned from the best; Carmelo Anthony
"Damm yo, sometimes when you hear stories like this, you start to see the age gap between players. dude said his favorite player is Kevin Durant. reminds when when they asked Kahwi who his favorite player growing up was, and he said Carmelo Anthony, and they still playing in the league together."
"I dunno, it might be easier to believe that Carmelo Anthony dropped 20 pounds in a summer because he wanted to be better able to chase Patty Mills around in their 2 games the coming season, having always taken his defensive responsibilities very seriously. I haven‚Äôt tried."
"Okay... it's harder to win a championship in the NCAA because the format is a ridiculous single elimination bracket where you have to go 6-0 against colleges where most players on the court are at a similar talent level. In the NBA, it's harder to win against superstars because you have to scheme around them, but you are able to scheme for your own superstars too. In the NCAA, the entire name of the game is team basketball. Even superstars like Carmelo Anthony at Syracuse, Steph Curry at Davidson had to keep the ball moving and couldn't just iso ball the entire time.   In the NBA I would say it's harder to keep a team's ego in check though, but in the NCAA it's harder to be able to coach truly amateur players to get minutes on the court. Everyone in the NBA understands basketball, not all NCAA players understand it fully yet and coaches have to teach as well as make those teachings fit into their system  I'm not arguing he's a better coach necessarily, I'm saying that there is an argument for it. I think that Jordan is better than LeBron but there's obv an argument for LeBron to be better than Jordan"
"After four-time Olympic medalist Carmelo Anthony, obviously."
Bruh imagine being Carmelo Anthony period lmao
"Skip: Are you kidding me? LeBron James, who is competing against a New York Knicks rival in Carmelo Anthony, jumped out to the water and saved his good friend Melo? Never have I seen a weaker moment than that right there. And trust me, how many times have I said that LeBron James is the best passer in basketball even to this day? But are you kidding me? You know, could you imagine if Michael Jeffrey Jordan, the real GOAT, jumped into the water to save Patrick Ewing? NO! He would have left him there drowning like he did to them in the 92 Playoffs. LeBron, you are no Michael Jordan. I'm sorry."
"&gt; Deng is getting more money than Melo and Dwight combined.  This bit is NOT true.  &gt;  the Lakers will pay Luol Deng more than Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard combined  True.  The reason is that the league picks up the checque for players on a 1 year vet minimum contract,.   $2,641,691   Waived and stretched players - the cap hit is stretched.

Are we referring to Lamelo as Melo now? Am I getting old? For me Melo will always be reserved for Carmelo Anthony.
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
His value was down in Atlanta. He was traded to OKC as salary filler in a Carmelo Anthony contract dump. Playing alongside CP3 and winning 6MOY increased his stock back up.
"Players who are better per 100 possessions than Evan Fournier out of the min players on the Lakers roster. Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kendrick Nunn, Dwight Howard (arguably), and Wayne Ellington. Like his raw stats are better, but he isn't actually more efficient with the possessions he gets than pretty much any of them. He just has a larger role than any of them."
"&gt; personally, I believe Carmelo anthony had a glimpse of the future and saw his entire knicks career  lmao"
"Are we really under the notion that Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Carmelo Anthony is going to be some superstar combo in comparison to KCP Kuzma and the 22nd pick? Seems like a wash at best imo"
"Pacers vs Knicks @ Madison Square Garden  Eastern Conference Semi-Finals May 6, 2013  We tied the series (1-1) at home in which Carmelo Anthony (my favorite player at the time) scored 32 points on 50% from the field in a 26-point blow out win. I decided to go to the game by myself and got GREAT seats for a great deal at the last second hours before tip-off somehow. I took the train from Trenton, NJ and my car was filled with Knicks fans. We pulled off a massive win, the first in the second round of a playoff series since the '99-00 season, and there were plenty of memorable [highlights](https://youtu.be/nR5yluxvvmk) and [moments](https://youtu.be/zxfwyQV3eWc) I‚Äôm glad I got to witness. Really fun team. At the end of the game we celebrated down the tunnel for MSG and they chanted ""SHUMP! SHUMP!"" at me as I had a flat-top at the time."
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  ‚Äú The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.‚Äù"

"You think that‚Äôs better than Carmelo Anthony, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard where have you been dude"
"We all know he's considering the Lakers. Imagine telling someone in 2015 that you could have a starting lineup of Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and LaMarcus Aldridge on the same team. Fuck I hate super teams lmao"
"I liked this thing the OP said about Westbrook:  &gt; Figure out a way to point his aggressiveness in the right direction and good things can happen  I'm *really* hoping that is true. I think Westbrook would be an incredibly helpful player if he focused on moving without the ball (namely on cuts to the basket), and funneled his energy most into defense and rebounds rather than scoring. Now he's shown absolutely zero interest in doing that so far in his career, but I'm really hoping that the Lakers can get him to move in that direction.   I think the Lakers could have a couple things going for them in their quest to get Westbrook to play smarter basketball by being a role player, beyond just Vogel and LeBron telling him to. I think that having both Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard there are two guys who once were players who have successfully changed their games to become productive role players once they were no longer stars, and I'm hopeful that maybe they can talk Westbrook into making the changes needed to play championship basketball. On top of that, this is the first time in his career where he'll clearly be the third best player on a team.  Of course, Westbrook strikes me as the most stubborn player the league has seen since Kobe retired (which can be both good and bad for a player), so maybe I'm just being hopelessly naive. Guess we'll see."
"As opposed to getting the corpse of Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Trevor ariza...."
"Laker fans act like this but they hype up their guys more than anyone. Ive never seen as many pro-Carmelo Anthony comments in the last couple years as ive seen in the last 24 hours.  Seriously go back and look at last year‚Äôs Dennis Schroeder post and then compare it to the words on guys who either haven‚Äôt played in a year or were like the 8th man on a lottery team. Kendrick Nunn and Malik were solid gets for a bench backcourt esp at their cost, but no have no idea if they will perform to par in the playoffs, and I‚Äôm already seeing Pelinka won the offseason posts.  Also, I have no idea who is actually going to replace KCP as the 3&amp;D shooting guard for this time. All I know is, you have to be doing mental gymnastics to think Wayne Ellington or Kent Bazemore are upgrades there.   You think they‚Äôve been bad with the Bron stans + Laker fans together, now they got the Westbrook stans, and the Melo stans now. It‚Äôs gonna reach a zenith we haven‚Äôt seen yet"
"Many people here probably forget, but Carmelo Anthony became very bad around the middle of the 2011-2012 Linsanity season."
Carmelo Anthony over a LeBron stepback I guess?
"I dont think thats the notion that he cant win.     The notion is he cant win a title. Hes like Allen Iverson, Carmelo Anthony, etc. He is one of these guys who is a great great player but he doesnt make his teammates around him better enough to help get him over the hump.    The issue with Russ more so than AI and Melo is that with Russ he will LITERALLY shoot you out of big games by taking bad shots and trying to be a 3 pt shooter. With AI and Melo it was more like these two can just score at will and they will do so but it isnt going to translate to a win.     James Harden is in the same boat as AI and Melo. Hes great. He can win you a series. But he will also shoot you completely out of games too. He could go 5-25 from three in a playoff game and you lose it cuz he plays hero ball.     Westbrook, Harden, AI, Melo, etc.     Wilt Chamberlain was kind of the same way. Great player but his best teams were when he decided he was going to be a distributor and not just score 50 points per game. All of a sudden Wilt let the NBA in assists and they were drastically better as a team overall. Which is part of what makes Bill Russell so great. He couldve done what Wilt did but he didnt because it was better for the team for him to play the way he played.     Hero ball usually doesnt end up in guys winning titles. In fact I cant think of any time in the last 30-40 years where its worked, if ever. Even the Jordan and Kobe teams all had a top tier coach with other all stars."
"""Carmelo Anthony becomes beloved bench scorer on the Trailblazers"" sounds like NBA mad-libs."

Was that playoff stats? Lol. We started noted center Anthony Tolliver and Carmelo Anthony when Whiteside went down for a few games. Whiteside soaked up a lot of minutes for Portland.
"Sports training and recovery is different in this era and they can extend their careers a bit farther.  But on top of that, Russ is 32yo and GP was 35yo when he joined the Lakers.  Malone was a 40yo starter in a much more physically demanding and tougher era and his backup was 42yo Horace Grant.   Carmelo will be a 37yo floor spacer off the bench behind Anthony Davis in his prime.   Marc Gasol is 36yo and Dwight Howard is 35yo.  It would be more comparable if that GP+Karl Malone team had been a thing when they still had a last leg of their athleticism left."
"https://heatnation.com/media/carmelo-anthony-explains-he-never-joined-lebron-james-dwyane-wade-miami-heat/   &gt; Smith then inquired further, asking about the conversations he had had with James and Wade leading up to the 2010 offseason.  &gt; ‚ÄúIt was, ‚ÄòTake the three-year deal. Take the three-year deal and let‚Äôs see what happens.‚Äô At that point in time, I was so naive to any of that. I didn‚Äôt know the business of basketball back then. I didn‚Äôt know what it meant to take a three-year deal opposed to a five-year deal. I‚Äôm not looking at, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not leaving two year‚Äôs worth of this money on the table.'‚Äù  &gt; Anthony signed a five-year contract extension with the Denver Nuggets in 2006, and unlike many other NBA stars‚Äô contracts, his didn‚Äôt have an opt-out clause at any point. If it had been structured with an opt-out clause, Anthony could have had the option to opt out and become a free agent in 2010"
As is Carmelo Anthony lol.  DeRozan was essentially 2010's Carmelo except with far less star power.
"&gt;Caruso is not a willing shooter he has averaged 2.1 three point attempts in the last 3 years.  He's averaged 20 minutes per game the last three years. He took 5.5 attempts per 100 possessions, which is below average but fine, and in-line with the volume of guys like Tobias Harris, Harrison Barnes, and Chris Paul. He was also more comfortable this year taking shots even when he wasn't wide open, which is important.  &gt;Of course Curry is going to be heavily guarded from three and he‚Äôs the best shooter ever so naturally he will make more difficult shots than 37 year old Carmelo Anthony.  This is a total non-sequitur. Nobody disagrees with this.  &gt;It‚Äôs not Carmelo‚Äôs fault that he has the luxury of more open shots.  My point is that if your best shooter is just above average and can't even play more than 20 minutes per game, and if your second best shooter is LeBron (while sharing the floor with AD and Westbrook), that team is a very very bad shooting team. Not sure how anyone can disagree with this.  &gt;Why are you downplaying other peoples percentages who happen to get more open threes?  Because if you're open, you should have higher percentages. That's the entire point. 38% from three is good on its face. However, league average when you're wide open is 39-40%. If you only take wide open shots but you shoot worse than 39%, that makes you below league average.   If you have a team of 37% shooters, but they only take wide open shots, that would be a team of terrible shooters. A team of shooters that shoots 35% on a mix of attempts on higher volume is more valuable and are better shooters than the first group."

"Caruso is not a willing shooter he has averaged 2.1 three point attempts in the last 3 years.   Also the point about difficulty of shot doesn‚Äôt play into this at all. Of course Curry is going to be heavily guarded from three and he‚Äôs the best shooter ever so naturally he will make more difficult shots than 37 year old Carmelo Anthony.   Why are you downplaying other peoples percentages who happen to get more open threes? Just because Curry makes harder threes doesn‚Äôt mean his percentage is on a different value scale than someone else, that‚Äôs just a consequence of being a great shooter.   It‚Äôs not Carmelo‚Äôs fault that he has the luxury of more open shots.  I also don‚Äôt really care about this because I‚Äôm not a Lakers fan. I just thought it was interesting comparing some of the players percentages. Was not intending it to go this far"
I don't understand the salt. Who did we sign that is changing things?   Is Carmelo 27 again? Is Dwight 26? Is Marc Gasol going to decide to show up before the playoffs this year? Carmelo Anthony is like 40.   Kendrick Nunn? Malik Monk? Kent Bazemore?   I'm confused.
"&gt;I am not considering shot difficulty or volume in this scenario at all.  Right, that's an issue. You obviously need to take that into account. Acknowledging that you're not taking it into consideration doesn't fix the fact that you don't consider it.  &gt; I‚Äôm just noting that in the threes that they take, those 4 make about 40% of them  Single season 3 point shooting has huge variance, it's better to use 3 year sample sizes where that group only makes about 36%.   &gt;Therefore they are not a total walking brickfest  The Lakers were 21st in 3P% the last two years and they just got worse by getting rid of capable and willing shooters (and defenders) like KCP and Caruso and replacing them with one of the worst volume shooters of all time in Westbrook and a guy who is probably not going to be able to crack more than 20 minutes a game because of his defensive issues in Carmelo Anthony.  Sure, they're not ALL awful from three, but you're being pedantic. The point is obviously that the Lakers were already bad from 3 and they managed to get worse.  Most teams in the league (and certainly the best teams,) have at least 2 very good shooters. When your best shooter is Carmelo Anthony and your second best shooter is LeBron James, that is a problem."
Kent Bazemore and Carmelo Anthony are not good basketball players.
"- Trevor Ariza - 36  - Dwight Howard - 36  - Wayne Ellington - 34  - Carmelo Anthony - 37  Clearly age of the player isn't a big consideration for the Lakers, and Caruso is only 27."
"These crybabies are the worst and I swear they‚Äôre growing more and more vocal as time goes on.   Oh no, Kent Bazemore and the corpse of Carmelo Anthony who‚Äôll be an active liability after the first round signed for the minimum, the league is ruined!!!"

"I see what you mean, I think the point was less that it was something Phil Jackson did *all the time*, and more about the fact that he literally did on occasion say things in press conferences that were critical of his players.

But also, Phil Jackson as the Knicks' team president [was way, way shittier](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19159149/carmelo-anthony-better-somewhere-else-phil-jackson-says) to Melo than anything Doc said about Ben Simmons :  &gt;""We've not been able to win with \[Anthony\] on the court at this time,"" Jackson said.

"Seriously, it's still Westbook, Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kyrie, Harden and Durant along with Carmelo, Dwight, Rondo, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus and Paul Millsap, all in one series.   Even with a bunch of these guys as old as they are it's still a crazy matchup."
"? People forget how long his career was and how many great players he guarded in their prime. Tracy Mc Grady, Paul Pierce, Clyde Drexler, Carmelo Anthony, Vince carter, Lebron and played heaps against KD, he always played point and always defended the best player."
"But this isn't great offense.   C: 2021 DeMarcus Cousins was statistically average offensively.   PF: 2021 Carmelo Anthony was a below average scorer and inefficient  SF: Jabari Parker in his prime was a solid 20 ppg guy, but not elite at any one thing  SG: Lou Williams in his prime was a great scorer, that was about it though, not a ton of facilitating. I think Simmons and Thybulle would be able to contain him in the halfcourt.   PG: 2020 Isaiah Thomas was garbage. He's averaged 11 ppg on 39% from the field over the last 3 seasons.   These are just offensive players that are atrocious on defense. Prime Lou and Jabari are really the only good offensive players here and neither were elite."
pretty sure its Carmelo Anthony

He's the Carmelo Anthony of the 80's and early 90's.  Great offensive talent who didn't make any noise in the playoffs and will be overlooked when people look at their primes in favor of other guys who won titles.
"&gt; An older example of this is a NYTimes profile of Shane Battier as a ""No Stats All-Star""  That article was excellent.  Manu is a guy who, not bad stats, but his NBA career averages *really* underrate him. 13-3-3 doesn't look too impressive - but he agreed to play the 6th man role for the betterment of the team, played for Pop who was ahead of the curve on load management which hurt everyone's stats, and was 25 years old as a rookie and retired at 40 so played most of his NBA career past his prime. Plus the 13-3-3 numbers don't take into account his international accomplishments. Granted most of these guys were young too and not in their primes yet, but in the 2004 Olympics Manu looked like a better player than LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Stephon Marbury, Richard Jefferson, Shawn Marion, and Lamar Odom."
"He‚Äôs just the modern day Carmelo Anthony.

It's that he now wants to be viewed (remembered) as a player with some grit and loyalty etched in his fabric, the kind of player with the will to compete and win championships. Unfortunately, there are just a few players with the drive to make that happen. The others merely want to appear to be that way. Carmelo fits the profile."
"First if Melo comes as a free agent we have a different team. I'm not sure we still get Tyson Chandler or J.R smith.

The draft comparisons for Parker back in the day included Carmelo Anthony so that shouldn't be too surprising.
"Somewhere in the US, Carmelo Anthony just sneezed"
"Interesting. There is a significant amount of variance in the numbers on that page vs. the numbers I got from bball reference. For example, I only found Carmelo Anthony to have been blocked 1006 times. That source has Melo being blocked 1379 times. I am surprised by the large discrepancy. I wonder where they source their data from."
"Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge (maybe) will be split among 2 teams."
"My favorite one ever:  Quote from the interview:  ""It's gonna be completely nuts, but it's also gonna be awesome,"" Anthony said. ""The whole city's gonna be behind me. I'm gonna be on SportsCenter every night. If we lose, I'm gonna get paid. If we win, I'm gonna get paid. But no matter what, I'm still a starter.""  And so, Carmelo went outside and sat by the pool while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  ""I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, the Rockets signed Carmelo Anthony,'"" he said. ""'The best player in the world is a Rocket.'"""
Carmelo Anthony
"I hear you but Alex English must be top of the list of snubs, before those three names. 8 seasons in a row with more than 2000 points scored, top scorer of his decade (80s). Carmelo Anthony is in there because he was a great scorer. English was undoubtedly a better scorer than Melo."
"List of players Paul Pierce was competing with for All NBA Forward position:   - LeBron James  - Tim Duncan  - Dirk Nowitzki   - Kevin Garnett  - Tracy McGrady  - Chris Webber   - Carmelo Anthony    List of players Anthony Davis is competing with for All NBA Center positions:    - Joel Embiid  - Nikola Jokic      That pretty much sums up the difference in All NBA selections right there for ya   Everything besides that is pretty self evident. More All Star appearances, FMVP, could actually consistently carry a team to the playoffs etc"
Yeah and his name is Carmelo Anthony.
Carmelo Anthony.
"&gt; The more I think about it I cant believe Tony Parker didnt make it  The second- (or third-) fiddle on great teams is the place where the list seems really inconsistent. James Worthy, yes. Robert Parish, yes (maybe we're at fourth fiddles at that point). Pippen and Rodman, yes. Ray Allen, yes. Anthony Davis, yes.  Klay, no. Dray, no. Parker, no. Manu, no.   Also, #1 guy on not great teams (Pete Maravich, Carmelo, Dominique - combined one conference finals appearance as the best guy) over elite #2 or #3 guy on a dynasty seems wrong. At least Nash has four conference finals appearances (3 as at least co-best guy)."
Carmelo Anthony being in there over Dwight is insanely disrespectful. Are the voters on this list old geezers who can only recognize isolation scoring?
Carmelo Anthony made top 75 no finals appearance
"For me, it‚Äôs like this:  **OUT**  Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard  **IN**  Dwight Howard   Grant Hill  I accept Carmelo Anthony‚Äôs inclusion on this list, he is one of the great scorers of his generation, but if he has to be replaced, I would replace him with Tracy McGrady.   And honourable mention to Vern Mikkelsen."
"&gt;Reggie Miller, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Carmelo Anthony, Dennis Rodman, and Westbrook  Yes, these players have all had better careers than Lillard. Don't cry now."
"Instead it‚Äôs people hating on adding AD and Dame when they have better cases than Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Carmelo Anthony, and Dennis Rodman"
"Especially Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Carmelo Anthony, and Anthony Davis"
"I think he deserved it over Carmelo Anthony too, that‚Äôs no disrespect to Melo btw I just think Dwight was better"
"Okay now do Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman, and Anthony Davis, and Carmelo Anthony"
"This list undervalued rim protection and shot blocking. That's why Dwight Howard was left off, Mutombo wasn't seriously considered, was Yao Ming wasn't even on the ""missed list"".  Possible hot take: I'd take McGrady, Vince Carter, or Grant Hill over Carmelo Anthony."
"Carmelo Anthony is a Top 75 player of all time and nothing you guys say will change that, so go ahead and post your daily ""would you rather have paul george or carmelo anthony?"" threads"
I think a better comparison for someone who Dwight should have got in over is Carmelo Anthony. I like Melo but there‚Äôs no way that Melo is better than Dwight
List:   - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Ray Allen - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Carmelo Anthony - Nate Archibald - Paul Arizin - Charles Barkley - Rick Barry - Elgin Baylor - Dave Bing - Larry Bird - Kobe Bryant - Wilt Chamberlain - Bob Cousy - Dave Cowens - Billy Cunningham - Stephen Curry - Anthony Davis - Dave DeBusschere - Clyde Drexler - Damian Lillard - Tim Duncan - Jerry Lucas - Kevin Durant - Karl Malone - Julius Erving - Moses Malone - Patrick Ewing - Pete Maravich - Walt Frazier - Bob McAdoo - Kevin Garnett - Kevin McHale - George Gervin - George Mikan - Hal Greer - Reggie Miller - James Harden - Earl Monroe - John Havlicek - Steve Nash - Elvin Hayes - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - Hakeem Olajuwon - LeBron James - Shaquille O'Neal - Magic Johnson - Robert Parish - Sam Jones - Chris Paul - Michael Jordan - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Bob Pettit - Kawhi Leonard - Paul Pierce - Scottie Pippen - Willis Reed - Oscar Robertson - David Robinson - Dennis Rodman - Bill Russell - Dolph Schayes - Bill Sharman - John Stockton - Isiah Thomas - Nate Thurmond - Wes Unseld - Dwyane Wade - Bill Walton - Jerry West - Russell Westbrook - Lenny Wilkens - Dominique Wilkins - James Worthy
Daryl Morey: There‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre trading Carmelo Anthony There‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre trading Chris Paul There‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre trading Russel Westbrook There‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre trading James Harden There‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre trading Ben Simmons Yea ok.
"Jusuf Nurkic was never considered a top 20-30 player in his era which are usually the most marketable, famous, and skilled players for their own respective era. Obviously there‚Äôs role players in this era better than most players in the 50s but there‚Äôs a difference between keeping George Milan in the top 75 all time over Nurkic than leaving out Carmelo Anthony for Dave DeBusschere"
"People take away from all these players way too much.   Prime Steph Curry, not Steph Curry that dropped a triple double opening night, but 2016 MVP Steph, was legendary and had the best shooting of anyone that we‚Äôve seen period.   John Stockton, who nobody will probably ever touch his steal and assist record was the greatest role player of all time. He did the dirty work that nobody wanted and had legendary court vision.   Tracy McGrady in his prime, scored 13 points in less than 45 seconds, legendary and clutch.  Carmelo Anthony in his prime was elite. He‚Äôs dropped off in recent years but everyone can appreciate his time in Denver and New York as amazing.   Rudy Gobert is in his prime. He‚Äôs won 3 of the 4 past DPOY awards and every team is forced to adjust their offensive plan to keep his impact as minimal as possible. Only 4 players have won 3 DPOYs, people won‚Äôt appreciate him until he‚Äôs gone.   Ayton hasn‚Äôt even tapped his prime yet. Still very young, very elite and underused for his shooting abilities in Phoenix. Will easily become a top 25 player in the league within the next 5 years."
"Damian Lillard, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Webber, Ewing.   Bench:   Westbrook, Oscar Roberston, Vince Carter, Ben Wallace, Dominique Wilkins, Gobert, Karl ‚ÄúKid diddler‚Äù Malone (Since I just hate his sorry self)"
"Gonna get killed by everyone for this but:  John Stockton, Steph Curry, McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gobert  6man: Ayton  This would actually be an amazing team, I just don't think these guys are/were as good as most think. I'm also mainly talking playoffs."
PG - Rajon Rondo  SG - Demar Derozan  SF - Vince Carter  PF - Carmelo Anthony  C - Domantas Sabonis
Maybe they wanted a source lol.   https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/02/carmelo-anthony-lamelo-ball-3-point-celebration/
"nice strawman lmao. the argument here is that when you just say ""melo"" with barely any context, don't get pissed when everyone assumes you're talking about Carmelo Anthony and not Lamelo Ball"
"I believe the final 25 will be:      11 Locks: Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Kawhi Leonard, Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Dolph Schayes, Dwyane Wade, Dominique Wilkins  6 Probables: Carmelo Anthony, Billy Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Robert Parish, Russell Westbrook  2 Likely but on the bubble: Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman  5 Squeaking in: Ray Allen, Dave Debusschere, Grant Hill, Bob McAdoo, Tracy McGrady  10 Biggest new omissions: Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Dikembe Mutombo, Tony Parker, Ben Wallace   4 Omissions from top 50: Dave Bing, Pete Maravich, Earl Monroe, Lenny Wilkens"
Everyone knows that RJ Barrett and Carmelo Anthony are elite defenders. Now we have the data to prove it.  https://go.nba.com/qgdv
"locks...   Giannis, Durant, Kobe, Wade, Nowitzki, Nash, Lebron, Kidd, Curry, Duncan, KG, AI, CP3, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Bob McAdoo, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard  decent chance but might not make it  Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony, Klay Thompson, Adrien Dantley, Tmac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kyle Lowry, Amare Stoudemire, Dominique Wilkins, Draymond Green   No shot but should get considered  Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Yao Ming, Ron Artest, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Joe Dumars, Shawn Kemp, Alonzo Mourning, Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, Derrick Rose  Should just fall off the list  Pete Maravich, Dave Bing, Lenny Wilkens, Hal Greer, George Gervin, Jerry Lucas, Robert Parrish, Nate Thurmond, Tiny Archibald"
"&gt;Carmelo Anthony and Malik Monk, who were the Lakers‚Äô two most harmful defenders in the preseason,   You don't say."
So who are the new 16 then if we assume those 9 are in.  Thinking the locks are:  LeBron Steph Kobe D Wade Westbrook Kawhi Dominique  Bob McAdoo Kidd Gary Payton  Then 6 spots left for:  Carmelo Dwight Howard Vince Carter Alex English Adrian Dantley Pau Gasol Bernard King Tracy McGrady Reggie Miller Luka Doncic Damian Lillard Anthony Davis
"All fair points.    The Nation of Islam is a funny comparison to bring up considering I was mainly thinking of Kanter's devotion to essentially a religious cult that aims to turn Turkey into a Theocracy. If Carmelo Anthony was currently lobbying to turn the American Government into some sort of NOI Theocracy while making statements like this on Tibet, people would rightly take it with a grain of salt.   I wouldn't say the context of his politics is completely unrelated. Most NBA fans who know Kanter have no idea about the Gulen side of his story. He has ulterior motives and I think it is fair to post as a reminder before the thread turns into a complete slop fest."
"This applies to a lot of ""heroes"".    Up until the 90s Muhammad Ali believed that black people were the original inhabitants of earth. Then Yakub (a scientist) went to a lab and created white people. He made them to be pure evil and violent. As a result, all black people are divine and all white people are inherently evil and demonic. That's what drove his activism.   (By the way, a lot of NBA players believe this right now. Carmelo Anthony, for example.)   Kanter's personal beliefs don't make his point less relevant. He's bringing up a good point and most of this thread is about his unrelated politics. Almost to distract from his message."
"Pretty much a battle of team chemistry. Warriors did a better job getting everyone involved and everyone contributed, they moved the ball better, they made their shots, they spaced and complemented each other's defense. Lakers didn't. It's a meme at this point that this Lakers team is a retirement home or whatever but that is also basically how they played as a team, too. Flashes of brilliance and moments where you go 'damn that's *Carmelo Anthony* coming off the bench or whatever, but not really putting that work in for the full 48.  Westbrook is the obvious scapegoat and it is hard to see how he fits in this roster, really, even where he can (and did) make some excellent passes, he also seemed to be getting in the way or not really having the room he normally needs to operate, too. But in the moments where it all worked out, you can see a lot of potential in this roster, quirks and all."
Imagine starting Carmelo Anthony in the playoffs.
Carmelo Anthony definitely has old school vibes. Very physical and doesn‚Äôt flop (minus the tough defense tho)
"#You have LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook.  Don‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs the early 2000s or the early 2020s  #And you‚Äôre fucking losing."
GET LEBRON BACK IN. WESTBROOK AND RONDO AND ANTHONY DAVIS AND CARMELO ANTHONY CAN'T HANDLE TOSCANO

"No trade request generally are asked for by the player, not the team.  And there have been no trade requests written into contracts previously, ie Carmelo Anthony and the New York Knicks."
lmao carmelo anthony is really on this team.

PG: Steve Nash. SG: James Harden. SF: Carmelo Anthony. PF: Antawn Jamison. C: Amare Stoudemire. This is probably the Best I could think of.
"Correct. Carmelo Anthony is not a generational talent but he had a great career. Not everyone in the hall of fame is a generational talent. Melo was top 5 in mvp voting one time. One time at #3. Not sure you can be a generational talent if you weren‚Äôt even viewed as the most important player in the league for one year , and it‚Äôs not like every mvp is a generational talent. Lebron, KD, Curry, Giannis are the only generational talents since Lebron entered the league. The point of a generational talent is that they are few and far between."
"If every player was in their prime. MJ, Shaq, Wilt, Bill Russell, Larry Bird, Hakeem, Kobe, lebron, Magic Johnson, Kareem would all be taken extremely high.  So say we start with a star and slowly work our way down the All time list. My team if I had the second pick in an all time fantasy draft.  Round 1 Bill Russell center  2. Pick 32 Allen Iverson if he's still available if not then Dwayne Wade sg  3 pick 62 Carmelo Anthony sf  4 pick 92 Larry Nance pf  5 pick 122 Rondo pg"
OP could have used Point per shot and made it more clear. Now you can see how KD is way  ahead the curve.

"I‚Äôm sorry our 4th best player was either Carmelo Anthony or Trevor Ariza and youre laughing at Oubre? Ooookayy bud, whatever you say   Not to mention our 3rd best was Hassan whiteside compared to Andrew Wiggins."
Give me a break.

"&gt; The model does not like this version of the team. L.A. has the ninth-best projected record in the conference, which would have the Lakers once again competing in the play-in tournament. The reason behind that: RAPTOR views LeBron James and Anthony Davis as the only net-positive players on the roster during the regular season.4 The model is particularly low on Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony, who are projected to play sizable roles. It‚Äôs notable that L.A. is given a better chance of postseason success than its projected win-loss record and point differential would suggest ‚Äî and that‚Äôs largely due to the presence of James and Davis."
"ur right in ur assessment of ben on offense, but black hole is more of a term used to sht on the carmelo anthony type iso players."
"He's not gonna stop whatever this is until people start treating him like Carmelo Anthony or something and blow him off because he's not worth the trouble.  Someone needs to drill it into Kyrie's head that being good at basketball isn't worth shit if you cause too many headaches for your team for them to be successful. He's not a good basketball player from the perspective of a GM, he's an expensive nuisance and a parasite."
"Just go and report in the trainings and games. Put a low effort, toxic behaviour. Take injury breaks as much as you can. After all when you say you have a sore back, there is no medical technology or doctor to prove this wrong.  And I think he should play like shit if he ever gets playing time. It‚Äôll lower his trade value greatly.  One of the worst decision for Carmelo Anthony was asking for trade after emerging as top 5 star player in the league. Knicks send tons of assets to get him so Melo fucked his NY career with his trade value. If Simmons gets traded for too much assets then he‚Äôll fail in his next destination as well.  -Imagine a Lillard-Simmons trade. It‚Äôd be fucking too tough to not disappoint Blazer fans.  -However if you‚Äôre traded for Mccollum then you‚Äôd have better chance to succeed with Lillardnd prove your worth.  Simmons should continue to tank his value. Kawhi did that and traded for only Derozan who was proven underperformer in playoffs. If Kawhi traded for FVV+Derozan+Siakam then Kawhi‚Äôs Raptors stint would be forgettable 2nd round exit"
"&gt; Does Russell Westbrook steal rebounds from his teammates? &gt;  &gt; According to Carmelo Anthony, the answer is a resounding yes. &gt;  &gt; En route to averaging a triple-double last season, the league‚Äôs reigning MVP drew criticism and praise alike. Some saw his amassing mind-numbing numbers as the result of an obvious pursuit to accumulate stats, while others credited him for having tremendous game impact. &gt;  &gt; Along the way, onlookers began to notice that Westbrook‚Äôs teammates would often box opposing players out and essentially clear the way for him to get an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù rebound, while others openly opined that he would ‚Äústeal‚Äù boards whenever he got the chance. &gt;  &gt; Lightheartedly, Anthony confirmed what many have said about Westbrook‚Äîhe‚Äôs a tiny bit of a kleptomaniac on the glass. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúHe steals,‚Äù Anthony said with a smile on Tuesday. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúSometimes, I wanna fight him a little bit and push him out the way.‚Äù  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2769810-carmelo-anthony-russell-westbrook-steals-rebounds-from-thunder-teammates"

"&gt;	Lakers didn't have 4 40% shooters last year  Technically you‚Äôre wrong, but yeah McKinne shouldn‚Äôt really count. So ‚Äújust‚Äù KCP, Caruso, and Gasol. KCP and Caruso are better than any of the ‚Äúshooters‚Äù you added  &gt;	And those guys you mentioned, Kuz, Matthews, McLemore, were all genuinely more negatives than they were positives   If Kuzma was more negative than positive wait till you watch Wayne Ellington and Carmelo Anthony lol"
"&gt;And you lost 4  Only ones that played any significant time were Caruso and KCP. The other guys you mentioned production is replaced with Nunn and Ariza.   &gt;Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol  Are we acting like Wayne Ellington and Melo aren't shooters now?"
"And you lost 4. Plus McLemore and Wesley Matthews who can both shoot.   Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol"
"Exactly. Guys like Iverson, Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony were really good at"
"He talked shit about the maturity of players during his Nuggets tenure with Melo, implying players lacked discipline because they grew up without fathers.  https://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/22/14059470/george-karl-carmelo-anthony-relationship-book-nuggets-knicks"

"Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, Carmelo Anthony, And LeBron James had a genuine plan to join forces on the Knicks, Chris Paul just ruined it by going to LA"
"He is too 10 &amp; def a all-time great.  Arguably the Melo trade didn't allow us to truly build a great contender around him - arguably.  Sure we gave up the pick that became Jamal Murray, Gallo &amp; some 1st Rd picks but the fact we were 2nd in the east, kicked the Heatles ass in the regular season &amp; only got stopped by Hibbert to reach the ECF, imo that knick team is underrated &amp; with that;  Carmelo Anthony has become underrated. We had a old ass squad featuring J.Kidd, Felton, JR, hobbled Amar'e with off the bench guys who carved a role like Steve Novak, Chris Copeland. Throw in Tyson Chandler, that knicks team was old &amp; injured but Melo deadass carried us through.  Shame we couldn't piece together another run with Melo but man he was indeed top 10."
I met Carmelo Anthony at some event in NYC years ago with my grandmother and brother
"The Solution to both problems? Carmelo ""Jab Step"" Anthony"
"You got absolutely none of that information right. [Amar‚Äôe himself said he wasn‚Äôt talking about Melo with those comments](https://www.espn.com/blog/new-york-knicks/post/_/id/64270/amare-stoudemire-i-wasnt-talking-about-carmelo-anthony), and Lin was never traded - he signed as an RFA. Houston gave him a poison pill contract that the Knicks couldn‚Äôt match even though they wanted to keep him"
How‚Äôs no one said Carmelo Anthony yet? I feel like that‚Äôs something he‚Äôll do after retirement.
I was listening to pardon my take and Carmelo Anthony said he only wears a large.
Yes bro please just use your brain and look at Carmelo Anthony vs Havlicek.
"I disagree,  Chris Paul being traded from Rockets -&gt; Thunder -&gt; Pheonix is a prime example of a players value changing drastically in a short period. Carmelo Anthony is another....recency bias is real in the NBA.   Sure, the league knows what Ben is...but as he is  increasingly becoming a public pain in the ass to the 76ers his value will only move in one direction - down.   Non-shooting guards are not what championship teams are looking for at the deadline."
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Can√ßar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."

Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
"2001-07 Paul Pierce      24.8 PPG/ 6.7 RPG/ 4.1 APG/ 1.7 SPG/ 0.7 BPG on 55.8% TS (+r3.3 TS%)      2008- 14 Carmelo Anthony      26.0 PPG/ 7.1 RPG/ 3.1 APG/ 1.1 SPG/ 0.5 BPG on 55.2% TS (+r1.3 TS%)  Pierce's ability to get free throws made him a more efficient scorer. What you're missing is that Pierce played alot of his career in a significantly less efficient and more defensive league- compared to their respective times, Pierce is more efficient."
"I think Paul Pierce is VERY slightly, but still definitively, better than Carmelo Anthony. Are we alone on this take?"

Lebron was hyped as the next goat in like 10th grade tho so you knew back then he was gonna be good  He went above NCAA champ Carmelo Anthony and Wade and Bosh also had incredible runs in the tournament  Even though Darko was a bust Pistons management legitimately thought he had better than Dirk potential and maybe he would have been decent or maybe all star caliber if the Pistons had prioritized his development
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, KP, KG, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, CP3"
"Better question, how is Kyrie over FREAKIN CARMELO ANTHONY on the first guy‚Äôs list???"
"Carmelo Anthony - past, present, and future"
"Any flashy/smooth volume scorer (ironically contrary to your op, but not on purpose).  Carmelo Anthony is literally literally (not figuratively literally) the most overrated player ever. Like that dude contributes zero to the holistic of winning games, which is the point of basketball. He actually might be the most valuable he‚Äôs ever been now, which is insane.  Similarly, players like kyrie and ESPECIALLY D‚ÄôLo are great examples. Wonderful offensive talents‚Ä¶ zero aptitude for anything else, and mental voids (albeit in their own different ways). I do understand that Kyrie made a game seven all-time game winner, just so we‚Äôre clear. I still wouldn‚Äôt take him for free on any team in the NBA trying to win a ring. That was a beautiful blip in what he is, but holy shit he‚Äôs atrocious for a team.  Kuzma used to fit this characterization but least people figured that one out."
"&gt;but not many talented bigs.  Yeah I guess Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwight Howard aren't good enough."
"‚ÄúHe steals sometimes, he steals rebounds.‚Äù ‚Äù‚Ä¶As long as we get the rebound‚Ä¶‚Äù - Carmelo Anthony   Honestly it‚Äôs not that big of a deal, it‚Äôs just a funny thing to bring up. Obviously him being an inefficient player is a more legitimate criticism. God even when you‚Äôre defending the guy you get called a casual, can‚Äôt win."
"Why am I thrown off his name is Anthony. Can we call Melo, Carmelo Tony now?"
"Yep, just trade the guy already...  **10 NBA Superstars Who Forced A Trade**   NBA players switch teams all the time, whether through free agency or a trade. Sometimes a player is traded because another team wants them to improve their roster, or because of salary cap constraints. But other times, players get traded because they request the trade themselves, and then end up at a destination that they prefer.    NBA superstars‚Äô trade requests carry a lot of weight. These players are the face of the franchise, and are usually the highest paid players on a roster. If they request a trade, then their franchise usually trades them to avoid dealing with a disgruntled superstar, and in hopes gaining value for the future in return, such as high draft picks. If the franchise holds out, then the player forces a trade using the leverage that they have. Here are 10 superstars throughout NBA history that have forced trades to other franchises:      1. Anthony Davis   2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Wilt Chamberlain   5. Chris Paul   6. James Harden   7. Kyrie Irving   8. Vince Carter   9. Carmelo Anthony   10. Paul George"
"Carmelo Anthony, man was literally banished from the league when he can still start on most teams"
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
I for one will absolutely continue to cheer my team on to lose as many games as possible and continue to shit on Portland while they stress about how to replace geriatric Carmelo Anthony in the rotation. Zero hesitation.
"Counterpoint: Carmelo Anthony, averaging 13 points off the bench for the Blazers, would have been an All-Star last season if the players decided the All-Stars.  12 players make the roster, and Carmelo was 12th in player voting.  The player vote is FAR worse than the fan vote and the media vote."
"the year is 2009.   The Warriors do what they had talked about and select Jordan Hill at 7.   Curry falls to the Knicks and Mike D‚ÄôAntoni at 8. the pair are a match made in Heaven. Carmelo doesn‚Äôt hurt his back running the primary ball handler position in the new offense.   the Knicks of Curry, Melo, Chandler improve to such a degree, they fall to the late 20‚Äôs in the 2011 draft. Shumpert is off the board, so they take the next best 2 guard left - Jimmy Butler.   A lineup of Curry, Butler, Anthony, STAT and Chandler now run the East."
"And AD was measured 6' 10"". We are supposed to believe that they are only 1.5 inch apart. My answer? No way. And anybody who has eyes' answer is ""what the f they were smoking when measuring Lebron?  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/anthony-davis-lebron-james-carmelo-anthony-and-russell-westbrook-of-picture-id1235580943?s=2048x2048"

Carmelo Anthony really gonna end up the best Lakers acquisition this offseason

CARMELO ANTHONY!!!!!
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr.

Yes. Or maybe we've been that bad. Did you know CARMELO ANTHONY PLAYED FOR US FOR A WHILE?!
"Didn't Garnett make a comment to Duncan about his dead mother?

Dwight is still one of my 2 all time favourite players. Him and Carmelo Anthony. The 2011 Magic and 2012 Knicks were something. I miss those days.
"The thing is that the Lakers have plenty of three point and midrange options. Unexpectedly Carmelo is playing some of his best basketball in years and is a proven spot up shooter. Lebron has evolved into a great spot up shooter, Anthony Davis has range etc.   What is killing the Lakers right now is turnovers and bad decisions which are out of sync with the team. One of Simmons biggest strengths is being a pass-first guy isn't necessarily a bad thing on a team where he is surrounded by willing shooters and scorers.  Again, its unlikely to happen because I am sure the way things have played out with Ben  that Lebron likely isn't wanting to bring the drama train to LA despite being tight with Klutch Sports and Simmons."
"Jokic doing [exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMdmIOfNfu8) what Morris did. Elbow to chest, hip to hip. I suppose you defended Carmelo Anthony here?"

Ngl I wish Jokic just clocked the motherfucker Carmelo Anthony style but actually powerful.  I'm with my boy Gortat they should allow fighting in NBA like they do in Hockey a lot of this dirty shit would self resolve.
It's wild to me that out of all the players they added it's old as hell Carmelo Anthony who's bailing them out next to AD.
"Like i said, watching a 37 year old carmelo anthony carry Lebrons team is more fun to watch than a guy running around screens all game. If i wanted to suffer watching that id just play 2k."
"Yes but they didnt just lose kuzma, harrel and KCP. They lost Schroeder and Caruso. I'm guessing Jeannie wouldve been willing to pay Caruso. Schroeder wouldve come back on a smaller deal with how bad he played in the playoffs. So we lost two of our most versatile defenders (KCP and kuzma) and one of the best guard defenders in the league and an average defender. Harrell, say what you will, we could use him right now. The icing on the cake is the FRP (lord knows we are short on those) that we lost. If Westbrook doesnt change we are probably looking at one of our worst trades and worst offseason changes in the past 20 years. For what? Carmelo Anthony who we could've signed on the min?"
"Man if players are allowed to get mad, refs are too lmao. How often does this shit happen. They get attacked every play for the entire 48 minutes and every free throw in between. I don‚Äôt doubt Carmelo Anthony, Westbrook and whoever the fuck else got T‚Äôd up weren‚Äôt all the way innocent"

""small college hero"", ""off the court class act"" lmao wtf does that have to do with the GOAT conversation?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Steph‚Äôs Accolade‚Äôs over 12 years:      3x champion 2nd all time 3-pointers 2x MVP (unanimous) 7x all star 7x all NBA All rookie first team 6-time all NBA 3-point field goal leader      Regular season career stats:      34.3 career mins per game 24.2 ppg 4.6 reb 5.9 ast 47.6 fg%  Some of the GOATS worth discussion (Lebron, MJ) both have 4 or more rings, in which they won Finals MVPs for all of them, have averaged 27 and 30 points in their careers, and are #3 and #5 in all time points respectively. Lebron and MJ both have 17 all star appearances, both were ROY, and both on all-defensive teams. In short, both players have more accolades and success with better career ppg, rpg, apg (not mj), spg, bpg, and fg%. What does steph have again...?  Right now he's ranked #71/#67 all time in points behind Bob McAdoo, is behind Ray Allen in 3 pointers, is tied with Giannis and Steve Nash with 2 mvps, is tied with the likes of Javale Mcgee, Patrick McCaw, and James Jones with 3 rings, has less all star appearances than Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, less all NBA appearances than Moses Malone, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Garnett, and less ROYs than Ben Simmons and Michael Carter Williams. In regards to defensive teams and finals mvps, he has the same as you and I do, 0.  Forget Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, and Duncan, curry is only discussed with and might be below Kareem, Big O, Jerry West, and even KD.  If you want to go off the fact that he is only 33, then I can literally point to Giannis only being 26 and Luka being 22 as better contenders for the GOAT case in the future.  Let's just say that if his game ages gracefully and he plays another 5 years with the best case scenario (another MVP, 2 Finals MVP+rings, 5x all star appearances, 30 ppg average), then he STILL doesn't beat any GOAT candidate. If you add 30 ppg for the rest of his 5 year career, he still only has 31000 points, which makes him 8th all time. If you add 5 more all star appearances he would still only would have 12. If you add another MVP he still only has 3, and if you add 2 more rings and finals mvps he would still only have 2 finals mvps and 5 rings, same as Kobe, who realistically also isn't even in the GOAT conversation.  Just to contextualize, Curry would have to have at least 2 more mvps, at least 2-3 more rings all with finals mvp, at least 5-6 defensive all nba first or second team selections, at least 6 more first team all nba selections, and at least 7 more all star selections to even have similar accolades to **compare** with GOAT tier players.   To have similar **career** stats, steph would have to literally average 43.7 points per game while playing every single game for the next 5 seasons, average 9.8 rebounds, and lord knows how many blocks/steals just to have a similar stat to the lowest of either GOAT player (27 ppg, 6.4 rpg).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: fuck no"
You would really make the argument that Carmelo Anthony has been more impactful on defense than Anthony Davis...
Carmelo Anthony is the greatest player in NBA history
[Can‚Äôt forget Dad Melo] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.postingandtoasting.com/platform/amp/2016/1/11/10748588/the-rise-of-dad-melo-the-very-best-version-of-carmelo-anthony)
"On current form, he should be getting all star buzz. It'll help him massively that he's Carmelo Anthony and on the Lakers."
"I can't believe I'm excited to see Carmelo Anthony check in for the Lakers. I know he has to play like prime Melo on offense to break even with his terrible defense, but if you're gonna play him, it's just insane not to give him those scoring opportunities."
Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony Davis.
"This is my admission of guilt for thinking that Carmelo Anthony was ever washed post OKC when he got traded around/cut/bought out a few times.  Also though, what the fuck was the end of that game lmao Russel Westbrook‚Äôs brain farts per 36 stats are absolutely outrageous"
"This is my admission of guilt for thinking that Carmelo Anthony was ever washed post OKC when he got traded around/cut/bought out a few times.  Also though, what the fuck was the end of that game lmao Russel Westbrook‚Äôs brain farts per 36 stats are absolutely outrageous"
If you told me coming into this season that Carmelo Anthony would be the Lakers' third best player...
"You mean Bulls GOAT, Carmelo Anthony?"

laker legend carmelo anthony
CARMELO MOTHERFUCKING ANTHONY
Is Carmelo Anthony the greatest spot up shooter of all time?
I was told Carmelo Anthony didn't play defense
"As a knick fan, I always felt brown was the more exciting prospect because he was advertised as athletic wing defender with mystery offensive upside that could be limitless, Tatum was advertised as Carmelo Anthony but actually this time and not jabari parker 2.0.  So far I feel like that‚Äôs held true, but brown is also hella streaky sometimes so I‚Äôm not sure which one I‚Äôd rather have.  Both obviously need to figure some things out this season"
When I was in high school (02-06) one of my friends was convinced that Carmelo Anthony‚Äôs real name was actually Anthony Carmelo. So I‚Äôll go with that.
"LeBron isn't coming back unless he can force the Lakers to trade him for Kevin Love.  We don't have the cap space to sign him.  He could always play a vet min season with us but I feel like that championship would always have a massive shameful asterisk next to it.  That's as blatantly cheating as you can get in the NBA.  Furthermore, do we want LeGM back?  Do we want him to force us to trade Isaac Okoro for Carmelo Anthony?  This team is built to be good for the next decade, we shouldn't be blowing that up just to get a championship run in now.  But you know LeBron doesn't care how the team's gonna look when he's 45.  I think he'll sign on a ten day and retire a Cav to end his career, and that'll be the last we see of him."
Carmelo Anthony knew it was Jeremy Lin's solo but instead he butts in with his baritone voice and steals the show.
Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony
zero surprise.  Lakes fans consistently have downvoted me for this opinion.  primary thing i have been wrong about is the vet-mins have performed a little better than expected due to Carmelo Anthony.
Leading scorers are Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony. Is this 2009 again?
"The third quarter is nearly done, and only Carmelo Anthony is in double figures (12 PTS)."
"**Los Angeles Lakers: 27% FG, 20% 3PT, 71% FT**  No Laker is in double figures in points, top scorers: Carmelo Anthony (8), Dwight Howard (7), 3 players (4).  No team can win a game with those numbers. The only reason why it‚Äôs not yet a blowout is because Portland was bricking shots in the second quarter, scoring only 15 points.  Also, we need to BOX OUT!!!!!!!! Damnit, they teach kids about boxing out"
"Sorry to break up the circle jerk but,, Carmelo Anthony is an open memeber of a racist Nation of Islam offshoot group. He believes that white people were invented by an evil scientist in a cave and that they are inherently evil while black people are Gods on earth. He probably shouldn't be anyone's role model."
Let‚Äôs put it this way. Prime Steph curry is obviously much better than a college freshmen Carmelo Anthony. A college freshmen Carmelo Anthony - an absolute beast of a scorer and really all-around player - won the whole damn thing himself. I‚Äôd have to say Prime Steph (who we might be seeing right now) would do the same thing with ease
"Melo is Carmelo anthony, and that will never change"
"There's a difference when Carmelo Anthony does his 10-20 pump fakes and catches you with one of these, he's creating space. But this is literally harden getting jammed up and trying to get bailed out by the refs, this was happening way to often, he was definitely one of the guys I feel like was abusing it and real blatant."

"Pelinka definitely also did a bad job building this roster.    It is very short sighted.  Good luck developing any talent for the future when the roster is loaded with deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony and Russ Westbrook.  They also no longer have any pieces for trades or to deal.   They are built to win now but I think they will struggle with winning anything meaningful. I absolutely would not be surprised with a first round playoff exit.  But the bad part of all that is if that happens, Lebron will not be accountable because he is a pseudo gm...he has all the influence but no actual accountability when it comes to these bad decisions."
"Historically speaking though, Carmelo Anthony has been pretty clutch overall. Sure he misses shots, but he has also made a lot of clutch shots in his career."
"Lakers are currently 26th in DReb%, idk how they achieved that with AD,Dwight and DJ playing their center minutes even with terrible boxing out. Is it because of Carmelo 'Fuck outta here' Anthony?"
When Carmelo Anthony is your answer this is what happens lol üòÇ
"Carmelo ""Marshawn Lynch"" Anthony with that final play"
"Imagine telling people, that in the year 2021, the Lakers are leaning on Carmelo Anthony in crunch time because Lebron James is out"
Carmelo Anthony??
Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony if you can ignore the 2 seasons after he left the Knicks
"Alternative title: Carmelo Anthony since Lebron has returned to play  Actually, both of his bad 3pt shooting games were when Lebron sat out"
"That's a loooong way to go...   **1984:** Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, John Stockton is 4 HOFers and probably top 30 all-time players.   **1996:** Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Ben Wallace is 5 HOFers and then you've got Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Antoine Walker, Peja Stojakovic, Jermaine O'Neal and Big Z who were all All Stars.   **2003:** LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh are all already or will be HOFers, then there's not masses after that in all fairness."
"I feel like everyone who says DeMarcus Cousins ""can't help a team, he lost his athleticism, he doesn't fit the modern NBA, he's a liability dwfensively, etc"" are the same people that wrote off Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwight Howard. The notion that it's over for DeMarcus Cousins is just media hype that people buy into. He's still a very talented player that could help a team. Denver is one of them"
"Carmelo, Lebron and Westbrook are like the most durable players in the league. The one to be concerned about the injury is Anthony Davis. Age does not have to do with being healthy."
"Yao Ming, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash and Carlos Boozer were all injured.    Carmelo Anthony, Ray Allen, Josh Howard and Mehmet Okur were chosen as replacements."
carmelo anthony is a game changer for the lakers. he is the 4th best player and the best shooter for the lakers. all for a vet min contract
"I mean Cam Payne (before his rookie contract was up) was traded for Taj Gibson, Doug mcbuckets and a 2nd round pick (I believe it became Mitchell Robinson). OKC then traded Kanter, Mcbuckets, and the 2nd pick for Carmelo Anthony. They then traded Anthony and a top 14 2022 protected pick for Dennis Schroeder. Dennis then got shipped to the Lakers for Danny Green, a first that became Jaden McDaniels I believe. OKC then packaged that pick to Minasota for pick 16 of the 2020 NBA draft to pick none other than Aleksej Pokusevski. So in the end I think the Thunder got their guy!  Also, at least Cameron Payne figured it out and is a role player in the NBA.  A D.  On your report carddoesn't bring your GPA down to a 1.0 if you have all A's."
What if Durant stayed in OKC?   What if OKC never traded James Harden?  What if Pistons Selected Carmelo Anthony?
"No dude wtf are you talking about, he came off the bench for the blazers last year and he's coming off the bench for the Lakers.  This ""Melo doesn't want to come off the bench"" shit is old. You're just spewing nonsense when you clearly don't even watch the games or done a slick of research.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32524499/carmelo-anthony-already-fitting-los-angeles-lakers-clears-misconception-reputation-easily-adaptable  &gt;Eventually, the¬†Portland Trail Blazers¬†resuscitated his career, and Anthony played his first season with Portland as a starter before transitioning to a bench role last season. He has been an elite substitute in L.A., averaging 16.7 points on 50% shooting (52.2% from 3) in coming off the bench in all seven games,"
"When i did a simple draft summary after watching some tape of that draft class, i was pretty low on the draft class in general, and the comparison and feel i got from tatum was that he has carmelo anthony tendencies in terms of high usage/low efficiency tendencies.   His first year in the league, i thought i was dead wrong due to how much better his shot selection was and how his defense went much beyond what carmelo ever did commit to. Am rather surprised that now in his shot selection went back to a more inefficient style of play. Maybe it's a low usage vs high usage sort of thing where he couldn't create additionals shots well from beyond the arc."
is Cole Anthony the love child of Carmelo Anthony from Syracuse days? has anyone looked into this??
"Man I always loved sitting down after a hard day of work and watching the Celtics, been watching them for 15 years now since I was a kid.   Now it‚Äôs just fucking shit and I have to turn the games off. For fucks sake, I like the KNICKS more than the celtics year. I used to swear at Carmelo Anthony and make fun of fucking Aaron Afflalo and now I wish my team had the guts that randle and Derrick rose show on the court every fucking night.   This celtics team is an embarrassment to all past Celtics teams and what the team is supposed to stand for."

"I agree but I don't think it really has anything to do with those guys.      For sure they have less of a ceiling because they don't have the size and athleticism of those big swings like Durant, Lebron, etc., but they mostly just didn't have anybody good on that roster.   Like there should never be a situation where Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter and Robet Covington are fighting out for the second-best player on the team, even with injuries.  The Portland FO has been absolute ass for most of the last ten years, which is also one of the reasons they have so many injuries.   That's what happened with Lob City, they had the best starting five in the league but they only had one player on the bench worth playing.    At some point injuries are inevitable when you have to play every one of your starters 40+ minutes a game in the playoffs.    That's the unspoken fact when everybody talks about that Clippers collapse against the Rockets, they could barely run up and down the court those last few games."
You think the team that let Rajon Rondo point a finger gun at a fan without penalty is censoring Carmelo Anthony?

I love how it‚Äôs becoming a basketball trend to shit on Carmelo Anthony even if the stuff isn‚Äôt even true
Well when you‚Äôre making Carmelo Anthony look like the DPOY then you know you‚Äôre not very good
"Carmelo Anthony. He is definitely not one of the 75 greatest players in history. He was a one dimensional scorer who never learned how to play defense or playmake for others. His brand of iso scoring was never efficient, scaled with other good players and never translated in the playoffs."
"Having 4 different players who can score 20 on any given night is a huge advantage, and Carmelo Anthony has been delivering in terms of scoring. LAL will definitely need someone from the bench who can pick up the scoring if LeBron, AD, and Westbrook are having tough shooting nights (like tonight)."
Carmelo Anthony

"I didn't particularly like the idea of adding KP in the first place because it looked to me like the FO was ignoring all the small ball stuff that happened in the playoffs throughout the 2010s. There's a question of defensive versatility that seemed to me like it was ignored at the time -- they were seemingly hoping he'd pop up back to full health and be able to run around the perimeter on D like AD. To my mind, the greatest benefit you get from a 6'7"" primary ball handler/playmaker is that it allows you to field a fully switchable lineup because you don't need a 6'1"" guy on the floor to close games -- not that that's how teams should always play, no, but if the situation calls for it playing only players between 6'6"" and 6'10"" (very roughly speaking, you get the idea) who can all switch, is a good option to have. When you're paying someone 30M/yr, well, you're definitely closing with him and that's also less cap you can allocate to players that can never be put into a position where they're played off the floor.  Also, the offensive impact he provided was always hugely overblown. He was never sufficiently good at shot creation and topped out at a hair over 40% on non-rim 2s. I don't care how good [LARPing 2012 Carmelo](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kristaps-porzingis-is-doing-his-best-carmelo-anthony-impression/) looks like or how good it makes him feel, those bullshit 16ft turnaround fadeaways were and and are crap offence because he's simply not good enough at them. Sometimes standing at the 3pt arc actually is the best thing to do for team success.  tl;dr: they made a bet I thought likely unwise at the time, bet didn't pan out, it sucks"
Carmelo Anthony vs OKC when he laid on the ground for 2 possessions was amazing
Enes Kanter -&gt; Cody Zeller  Carmelo Anthony -&gt; Larry Nance Jr  Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking bad and not playing -&gt; Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking like passable NBA players and playing  Dame needing to score 60 to win -&gt; Dame can have bad nights and the team still has other scorers and playmakers contributing
"Last year we started enes Kanter for 30 games and when we didn‚Äôt we had Carmelo Anthony and Kanter off the bench. We were average defensively in the games Nurkic played.   This year it‚Äôs Larry nance, Cody Zeller, and nassir little(who is turning into a contributor this year). That plus the new defense and guys are trying really hard is making a big difference"
Carmelo Anthony Davis
did you just compare carmelo anthony and montrez harrel
"One problem no one mentions is that Portland is the most isolated city geographically-- it's not near any other NBA city, so travel is always bad. It's also more likely to be far, far away from a player's hometown.  Portland is at least reasonably close to Lillard's home city in the Bay Area and about the same distance to where he went to college.  Carmelo Anthony refused to look at Portland despite his friendship with Dame and CJ until he (and the Blazers) were desperate because of the isolation. Of course, once there he stayed two seasons."
"Top Google result for ""postseason Melo"" is an article called  &gt; The Disappointing Career of Carmelo Anthony"
"It wasn't a stretch in 2013. LeBron was just that good that year. [Here is an article about why the one reporter voted Melo as MVP](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/05/06/lebron-james-nba-mvp-unanimous-carmelo-anthony). It wasn't to make sure he wasn't unanimous like is so often quoted. It was because he interpreted MVP as most valuable and not best player in the league, and he thought Carmelo was more valuable to the Knicks than LeBron was to the Heat. And he was right. You can disagree with his method, but Anthony deserved to be in the conversation that year."
Damn a sad end to a career that should have shined much brighter. I'm pretty sure racism has to do with why he wasn't given the chances he should have. Obligatory fuck Carmelo Anthony.
Carmelo Anthony-esque! lmao

"Honestly, it took me a while to figure out what you were saying and not because of poor phrasing on your part.  I believe that you're saying that Danilo Gallinari, De'Andre Hunter, Clint Capela should be listed along with Carmelo Anthony and the rest of that group, but the ""third best on their team"" would be either John Collins or Bogdan Bogdanovic."

Not including the bubble I think I read that Carmelo Anthony hasn't won an away game in Denver since he was traded to the Knicks. Even without this ongoing curse I have the Nuggets beating the Blazers in 5

"The point is Westbrook didn‚Äôt do anything in the postseason after KD left. Three first round bounces. One was the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù season, the next was with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony, and then another with Paul George. You can‚Äôt talk about what Russ *did* do and not talk about what he *didn‚Äôt* do. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an argument to say Paul George is/was better than Blake Griffin, especially since the former is a 2-way player."
"I don't need to watch him to know he has neither the tools, desire, or reputation.   For what its worth I went looking on a few metrics for him and my finger got tired from scrolling.  Hes 234th out of 250 in defensive raptor, for example. In the same area as Demar Derozan, Carmelo Anthony, DeAngelo Russell, Damian Lillard and Trae Young. Tell me defensive Raptor isn't on to something."
Westbrook is not KG. He‚Äôs on the Carmelo Anthony/Allen Iverson tier
"A decade too late, Carmelo Anthony should have joined the Miami Heat in 2010-11 season when the 2003 Draft elite was on their peak. He chose money first in his younger years, then suddenly opted to chase rings when on the downslide. Reverse psychology."

Carmelo Anthony... if your name is Anthony
Carmelo Anthony and Lou Williams: COME ON DOWN!
"KD, Curry, and LeBron are all over 33. Pair them up with old times like Horford or Millsap, and I'm sure they'd be odds on favs.  It's about talent, not age.   LBJ, Anthony Davis, and Westbrook are obviously an amazing core. Questions about chemistry sure, but you throw in Dwight, Gasol, Ariza, and maybe Carmelo and Rudy Gay... old or not, that is some fire power.   The back-up point guard is what I'd be most concerned about. Wish they still had Rondo."
Plus there are the [Carmelo Anthony rumors](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/07/31/nba-rumors-lakers-interested-carmelo-anthony) as well. Might as well go full old school!
"Lakers are not done obviously.   People don't see it.   They didn't signed THT yet. Schroder still unsigned as well.   DeRozan is likely the one Lakers-Clippers-Spurs are fighting over.   But Kawhi too hasn't signed with the Clips.   I sense a bigger wave coming. Especially with these contenders role players in Danny Green, Reggie Jackson, Andre Igoudala, Carmelo Anthony, etc are still staying put. Oubre hasn't signed as well.   Something is up for sure."
"LeBron, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Carmelo and Russ were all in the 2012 All Star game, as was Luol Deng who is also still technically on their roster. Recent Laker Rajon Rondo was also in that game, as were buyout candidate Kevin Love and current Lakers target Andre Iguodala. AD made the 2014 game:  Westbrook, James, Anthony, Davis, Howard.   Rondo, Iguodala, Deng, Love, Gasol.   TL;DR: Finalise Melo and Iguodala, bring Rondo back, wait for a Love buyout and get the decrepit corpse of Luol Deng back on the court, boys. We're winding back the clock."
"Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gay, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard  Early 2010's cheat code, and then AD came not long after, with Ariza and Marc Gasol off the bench too."

Carmelo Anthony soon
That's insane spacing for what this roster is.   Russell/Mils/Hield/LeBron/Anthony  They're going to stagger LeBron and Russell significantly to make up for their weak bench. Not sure Carmelo can hold down 6th man all the way to the finals.

Agreed. But you also can't argue that it's a known. I woke up this morning and heard that teams are fighting to get Carmelo Anthony. Players sometimes do adjust to a role.

"Brandon Roy is part of the reason that Portland has re-embraced the Blazers after the ""Jail Blazers"" period, and the reason that Carmelo Anthony couldn't wear #7 here. He's getting his jersey retired."
Man it‚Äôs the off-season and we‚Äôre talking about starting Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony on the Lakers.   Obviously they are HOFers.
It‚Äôs been real sad going from the earlier Reddit days of seeing people argue about Carmelo Anthony to arguing about Frank Ntilikina smh. I liked Frank though. Pour one out
"People are going to down vote because it's fun to shit on Pierce, but Paul Pierce had to develop that old man game early on, after he got stabbed 11 times and was close to death.  Paul Pierce is built a lot like Carmelo Anthony, where, at first blush, they both kinda look a bit pudgy and out of shape, but in reality, they're both stronk af brick shithouses.  Pierce made plenty of players look like fools with his sneaky slow motion moves."
Sorry to say it. Carmelo Anthony. Dudes due for a big drop off.
There is absolutely 0 chance AD is above Carmelo Anthony if this is an all time list. Thats just grade A foolishness. I actually pity anyone that thinks otherwise
"Report: Lakers also have ‚Äòstrong interest‚Äô in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, and the Statue of Liberty."
That's my point... we can do exactly that if we actually add back some good defenders. That is the opposite of signing people like Demar Derozan and Carmelo Anthony who are objectively bad defenders. You can't continue to add subpar defenders when we already did that with Russ too.
"lmao defensive monster playing against Tiago Splitter, Roy Hibbert, and Grandpa KG  Duncan gave him the business in 2013 and then the entire Heat team got demolished in 2014  Bosh averaged 13/7 in the playoffs.   Carmelo was getting MVP votes at this time and he was finally playing PF in New York where he was at his best.   to think Carmelo Anthony would be getting guarded by Lance Stephenson, Manu Ginobilli/Boris Diaw, and Carlos Boozer is just insane to think of  not to mention Dwayne Wade is getting the 3rd most attention   somebody is going for 30 every single night.    Carmelo was winning scoring titles and going deep into the West in Denver. Bosh was campaigning to make the all-star game   Carmelo easily makes the Heat so much better. they could just run Birdman at the 5 and be completely fine. they made the finals with Joel Anthony"

"so a whole squad of aging guys with tons of miles on their bodies? Rudy Gay is 34 (will be 35 in 3 weeks), cant really play d and has historically been an inconsistent 3 point shooter.  Carmelo Anthony is....Carmelo Anthony, a 37 year old that isnt known for his defense, with a ton of miles on his body, that has been an average 3 point shooter.   Derozan is going to be the young guy out of this bunch at 31 (32 in a week or so), who has tons of miles on his body, and has never been known as a defender or 3 point shooter.   But Im sure it'll work out. Especially with a 37 year old Lebron, a historically injury prone PF, and a 36 year old Marc Gasol as your starting center. Westbrook will be able to corral these guys together at pg with his great 3 point shooting, right?  Im not trolling when I say this, are Lakers even going to make the playoffs? Jesus"
Carmelo Anthony &amp; Lebron James. That's a pairing made in heaven.
"Ben is gonna end up like Post-OKC Carmelo Anthony, probably for a year. Then signs up with a playoff caliber team.   Really not sure with that tho since Melo can shoot."
"The only players capable of doing this are max level players, see Schroder for examples of mid level guys boning themselves going big brain- in this case Simmons has leverage.  I know people see this as a shitshow, but it‚Äôs actually being pumped in the news so much because it‚Äôs keeping NBA news alive in a lull moment in the dead of the offseason, and owners only care about their bottom line- max level players causing drama and investing multiple fanbases in an ongoing storyline that gets clicks across the board?  End of the day, this isn‚Äôt the first or last time a player flexes on a franchise, Vince Carter, Andrew Bynum, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony, you could just keep listing names and situations.  Again, this does not hurt any of the owners profits, while owners care about their ability to steer their teams, they recognize that stars are holding more leverage in this era."
"&gt;	‚Äúall the previous years their defense without him was way worse [than] last season‚Äù  This line kind of negates your argument about the defense *just* being good because the other teams stars were on the bench, since that should happen every year.   My personal theory is that last years defense was comparatively better on defense because players knew they had to put a ton of effort into defense, since they didn‚Äôt have the top end offensive talent to compete. Fringe NBA players that can‚Äôt score a ton, like Juan Toscano-Anderson, don‚Äôt have privilege of sandbagging on defense, like Carmelo Anthony.   **Personal Anecdote:** It‚Äôs like when I play pick up games at the Y. I usually play in pickup games in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù Court, where all the not great, but not terrible people play, and on that court I get to do dribble moves, create my own shot, and play some PG. In those games, I don‚Äôt can‚Äôt try my hardest at defense, cause then I‚Äôll be too tired to run the offense. However, occasionally when the Y is a little empty, I‚Äôll get called on to play on the ‚Äúgood‚Äù court, and in those games I‚Äôm not as good at creating my own shot as other guys on my team. As a result, I basically just convert into a 3 and D player, and focus almost all my energy into being a pest on defense."
I thought they were called ball stoppers like Carmelo Anthony used to be called a ball stopper because he would get the ball on the wing and do exactly how you described a black hole
"On the most recent Only Fans podcast(NBA/Comedy) the guys NPR intro the show and talk about Ben Simmons current situation, Carmelo Anthony, Mike the Situation calling the police, Kim K on SNL, Josh drinks too much and more!! [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/MEBF1cLugHc)"
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he‚Äôs technically a SG but I couldn‚Äôt find any other PG‚Äôs besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren‚Äôt from NY and since it‚Äôd be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
&gt;  if Paul George played with LeBron for a decade  No one in NBA history has had better teammates than lebron and he's still only 4-6 in the finals  HALL-OF-FAME TEAMMATES  LeBron:  * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Russell Westbrook * Carmelo Anthony * Derrick Rose * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal  Jordan:  * Pippen * Rodman * Kukoc * Parish
&gt; KD would be nothing but a Carmelo Anthony of his age without his teammates  KD is much better than melo so I'm not sure I get this comparison. Are you saying he would be viewed in a negative light if he never had good enough teammates to win it all? Because you can say that about anyone.
I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs even an arguable question. Kobe hands down.  KD would be nothing but a Carmelo Anthony of his age without his teammates. Accolades aside Kobe would still be Kobe. 81 points.  Two years robbed of the MVP award.  Influence of a whole generation of players.
Fav. Miles Bridges  Least. Carmelo Anthony
Carmelo Anthony is better than Paul Pierce.
"Guys. Chill.   Kyrie still has a pending question to Brad Stevens about what government is.   Once Brad answers that question, Kyrie will understand that the government really does get to say he can't play home games if he isn't vaccinated.   Then, because he wants to win a championship with KD in Brooklyn, Kyrie will get the jabs.   He will first seek the jabs from famous Jan stepper Carmelo Anthony. But after Carmelo explains to Kyrie that jab steps are different than vaccinations, Kyrie will go to his local CVS pharmacy and get a couple doses of the Pfizer.   Just give this time to play out. Brooklyn understands Kyrie's unique basketball genius will eventually lead him to a COVID-19 vaccine, so of course they're not gonna trade him to Philly."
"No, they know what he‚Äôs worth and they want that back. I find it funny Daryl Morey has an issue with Ben Simmons not reporting to the team when he‚Äôs the same guy who sat Carmelo Anthony for 30+ games until he found a suitable trade for him. When Melo wanted to play."
"not gonna lie, when it said ""James and Anthony"" my mind filled in Davis, not Carmelo, and I was like ""the author knows they've played 2 seasons and won a title, right?""  either way, of course Melo and LBJ will complement each other well...it's LeBron!!"

"We were 17th in defense in the games Nurkic played(29th overall when starting kanter). We replaced Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony with Nance, Zeller, and Snell.   Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to believe we can be a top 10 defense again(were 6th in 2018 starting dame, CJ, aminu, harkless, Nurk)"
"- LeBrOptimus 6th Prime James,  - Carmelo Anthony,  - Wayne Ellington,  - Kent Bazemore, - Trevor Ariza,  - Malik Monk,  - Talen Horton-Tucker,   Lakers wing depth those wondering."
That doesn't mean much though. Carmelo Anthony is an open believer of some seriously f'd up racist stuff and people still love that dude.
I thought he should've been an all-star instead of Carmelo Anthony back in 2017
"Carmelo may not be the player he once was. He might be bad on defense. He might not be an offensive juggernaut anymore, where you can dump him the ball and expect points no matter what.  But Carmelo Anthony will win you ball games. Them's the facts."
" After an ugly and shameful, turnover-filled first quarter, LAL completely turned this game around, and never looked back. LeBron and Carmelo were our two best players, solid contributions from Russell Westbrook, Avery Bradley, and Anthony Davis. Dwight Howard and DJ were so important in gaining those second chances buckets to help us keep the lead.  **Positives**: focus and effort for the last 3 quarters, very strong defensively in the fourth. Carmelo Anthony and LeBron. Dwight Howard hit a three.  **Negatives**: We still need to defend the pick and roll better. We need to start the game sharper, and relax on our turnovers."
"Carmelo Anthony is a joy to watch when he's on. Fucking swished most of his shots tonight.  LeBron looked rusty shooting but every time he goes to the rim it's money in the bank.  Russ had his good moments tonight and was important when LeBron went to the bench in the third, he had some stupid passes that were saved by his teammates in the 1st but he improved from there.  AB was great on defense, Reeves had some solid minutes.   AD might be averaging 28/12 but at times it just feels like he's not that guy, I guess injuries have affected him and it might take a while for him to trust himself again.   Vogel should never ever play AD and DJ together, the Lakers looked like a high school team with those two and actually good simply with AD."
 Carmelo Anthony has caught fire.
Hell no lol I‚Äôm a sixers fan. Carmelo Anthony has been my fav player since I was a kid so I follow him as a player. Hate the lakers though
Oh the Carmelo Anthony.
Carmelo Anthony - Hawks
"The most asinine part of it for me is that it's not like anyone needs help figuring out what kind of players to put around LeBron at this point; the formula of shooters + LeBron has been established for over a decade.  Instead the Lakers are relying on Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, and when healthy Wayne Ellington, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor ariza to space the floor because they brought in two non-shooting guards in Russ and Rondo."
Giannis  Carmelo  Charles Barkley  Larry Bird  Billy Cunningham  Anthony Davis  Dave Debusschere  Tim Duncan  Kevin Garnett  Elvin Hayes  Lebron James  Jerry Lucas  Karl Malone  Bob McAdoo  Kevin McHale  Dirk Nowitzki  Bob Pettit  Dennis Rodman  Dolph Schayes  Nate Thurmond  There's maybe 3 or 4 people I'd put below Kevin Love.  JJ Reddick is just ignorant.

"But it is to predict the Timberwolves blowing the Lakers out by 30 in a 4-0 sweep sending Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard into an early retirement."
