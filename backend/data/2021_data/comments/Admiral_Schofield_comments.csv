"I’m just a fan of girthy thicc muscular jacked chad like Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Semi Ojeleye, Admiral Schofield"
i was sure Admiral Schofield will have success in NBA  especially being drafted by Wizards who had no depth at SG/SF last year
"Nathan Knight sounds metal af.   Not Admiral Schofield tier, but not too far behind."
Admiral Schofield is from London too
Doesn’t that come from when he and Admiral Schofield were playing together at Tennessee?
I think you are overating Admiral Schofield just a bit.
I don't think drafting players like Admiral Schofield or Cassius Winston ... is much better than trading away 2nds
I think Patrick Patterson and Admiral Schofield are two other recent waivees by OKC.
"UT has a randomly great strength coach for the basketball team. Look at Grant Williams and Admiral Schofield, they're jacked too"
"Number 2 recruiting class in the country is coming in this year. Last year was a bit disappointing but produced 2 first round picks. The couple of years before that produced Grant Williams, Admiral Schofield, Jordan Bone, and a couple other drafted players. Rick Barnes has the program running as well as it really could at what is at least nominally a football school. Nows a good time to get started  I lived in Knoxville for about 20 years and went to school there. The only other time in my life that the basketball has been this good was peak Bruce Pearl, but those teams never really made NBA talent, if you care about that"
&gt;Admiral Schofield.  He's only a couple of months younger than Ben Simmons. Soon to be entering his prime. Gotta buy now
It’s Admiral Schofield.
He used to be teammates with Thunder legend Admiral Schofield when they both played on the Wizards and the Wizards' g-league team.
He's worth drafting just for his name. Admiral Schofield but good
I really thought Admiral Schofield would be good
Severe lack of Admiral Schofield appreciation ITT
Admiral Schofield
Do not forget Sindarius Thornwell and Admiral Schofield.
Admiral Schofield
Second best NBA name behind only Admiral Schofield.
No we picked Admiral Schofield over Terrance Mann.. we deserve this..
"Duncan Robinson was undrafted and Admiral Schofield was good in college but went 42nd definitely not a sure thing - some 12 year old, probably"
