"PER is just a stat that seeks to combine box score stats into one number. When most people talk about efficiency, they're talking about how well a player scores. Westbrook is below 50 TS% this season and shooting 43% on 2 point shots. Even Dejounte Murray scores more efficiently than Westbrook and he's not known for his offense."
"Right now? I‚Äôd put him behind Beverley, Jrue, Simmons, Brogdon, Rozier, Lowry, Wall, Fultz (healthy), Schr√∂der, Dejounte Murray, Ball/Bledsoe, Smart, Brogdon, Fox, Conley, CP3. So in the 17-20 range. Below average defensively"
"&gt;ESPN‚Äôs Bobby Marks took a look at the extensions that were and weren‚Äôt handed out on Monday and offered some analysis on Ball‚Äôs situation. Marks cited a pair of recent contracts as barometers for Ball heading into contract negotiations.  &gt;‚ÄúIf Ball stays healthy and plays at a high level this season, a new contract should start in the $16-18 million range next offseason, similar to the Hornets‚Äô Terry Rozier and Spurs‚Äô Dejounte Murray (keep in mind that the $16.8 million salary this season of teammate Eric Bledsoe ranks No. 22 among all point guards). The high end for Ball would be the four-year, $80 million contract that Malcolm Brogdon signed with the Indiana Pacers in 2019.‚Äù  This was written back in November before Giannis resigned with the bucks. A lot of teams were preserving cap space for next summer and now whats left?   Its obvious that a lot of you let your emotion cloud your judgement with contracts. Your opinion on lonzo are irrelevant, if he rediscovers his 3 ball then he will be highly sought after next summer. Someone is going to pay him big money."

"Dejounte Murray made a significant improvement this season. Most disappointing has been Derrick being hurt. Not counting injuries, it has been Aldridge. His defense is complete garbage now and I'm always surprised when teams don't involve him in as many pick and rolls as they can."
"2016 class lowkey stacked.  Jamal Murray, buddy hield, and sabonis also in lottery, other role players throughout the draft, and guys like siakam, levert, dejounte murray, Brogdon went super late, not to mention a few good undrafted guys too"

Love dejounte Murray
"I mean instead of getting a Cory Joseph at 29 two years in a row. I would love to miss out on two 29th picks straight and then 3rd year finding Dejounte Murray or Derrick White at 29.  What I mean is if you find a Murray/White every third year, that's great, but there's not much great about finding Cory Joseph. It doesn't elevate your team at all."
"What the fuck are you even saying when one Murray just closed the nuggets out?   Jamal is clutch, so is dejounte. That‚Äôs not exactly quantifiable or a huge factor to be honest with you. Defense is something dejounte is objectively elite at his position at."
Bruh y'all second best player is dejounte MurrayüíÄ fym
We simp for Dejounte Murray!
"I just learned that New Balance has both Dejounte Murray and Jamal Murray, maybe they're trying to collect all the Murrays in the league, are there any other Murrays that they need to get?"
"Demar's been in all star form in each season with Spurs, its jus now the players around him are better, he doesn't have to over exert himself tryna carry, gets more assists.  Aldridge is still an incredible shooter, has done good to hit more 3s, but is atrocious on d. Poetle is exceptional on d but terrible at shooting. Centre is our weakest position and typically we lose to teams with good big men.  Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray have both been incredible, could both be in the convo for MIP. Vassell looks great but still gets less minutes being a rookie. That said wouldn' be surprised if he takes more minutes from Lonnie Walker once our star pg Derrick White is healthy.  Patty FIBA Mills. Patty fucking Mills. Is a solid candidate for 6th man of the year. Been playing out his skin this year.  So yeah peeps might stop sleepin on us soon. There's weaknesses to the team, youth can be inconsistent, but they play with so much heart. So much fun to watch."
The real Murray.  Tbf Jamal playing injured but dejounte still outplayed him
"Denard is still playing at an Allstar level LA has slowed down but can still get hot.just doesnt fit the fast pace system the spurs have   the big difference is that the youngers are developing. Murray is averaging 15pt, 6 rebs and 5 ast while playing solid defense  Keldon is looking like an Allstar! Vassal has been solid for us Jakob has helped the over defense is now in the closing lineup.   the biggest thing for us will be Consistency on both ends.  Demar is going to give us 20, now if Dejounte/ LA,Keldon can give us 20, and a 3rd stater gives us around 15, we will win!  this team reminds me of the 2014 spurs, no real superstar, but have one guy (dd) that plays like an all start, and a bunch of other guys that are playing great. plus we have star developing (keldon) similar to Kawhi. than we have Murray who's showing his potential and could he another Allstar.   the wildcard so far has been Walker, he raw and has been inconsistent, but he shown flashes of taking over. it's a bright future in SA."
"Already taken him, he now goes by Dejounte Murray"
Jamal had a great game as well. Yes Dejounte is playing great right now and he's a great player but say this when Dejounte puts up a performance like Murray did in the playoffs.
"Dejounte Murray is having a breakout season, DeMar playing at an All Star level, Keldon Johnson looks like the steal of his draft class as a sophomore, Vasell and Poeltl provide the defense we need and LMA and Rudy, tho inconsistent, have been important for us too"

Maybe counts as young-ish (24) but I've been valuing Dejounte Murray pretty high this year
"There's no way you can compare the spurs to the wizards lol. The spurs have dejounte Murray, derozan, Aldridge, keldon johnson, two good veterans in patty mills and rudy gay, as well as promising young talent in Lonnie walker and derrick white. The spurs roster is WAY better than the wizards."
Dejounte Murray Bam
"I'd add smart as well. Although he acts like he's curry even though he's an inconsistent shooter. he's still great at everything else.  Lu Dort also needs a mention, dude is incredible on defense.  Dejounte Murray could make a case for this list too, great defense and good playmaking, really great rebounding for a guard, too."
"&gt; murray is a way better defender than mills  Understatement of the century. On defense, Dejounte is a huge plus and Patty is a massive minus."
"that's one reason I like when DeJounte Murray goes for the triple double. he isn't getting crazy usage to rack up assists and he is getting a lot of contested boards to get there. don't get me wrong, there are some of those Russ rebounds, like free throw misses and shit, but most of them are legit. That's not to say Russ isn't one of the best rebounding guards of all time, I just think his numbers are a bit inflated."

I'd love to get one of Dragic, Rubio or McConnell to fill that role. My dream would be Dejounte Murray but it makes no sense whatsoever."
"I‚Äôve had such a tough week but i‚Äôm up 20 entering tomorrow. Getting Porter, Sexton and Garland back in the latter half of the week has helped. Hunter missed a game. Dejounte Murray hurt. Christian Wood hurt. CJ and Caris now out for a month +. It‚Äôs been a rough week for me lol. Best of luck pulling out the W tomorrow"
"Borrego is Pop tree, they all do this to their rookies  Keldon Johnson barely played last season for the Spurs and now he starts and gets over 30 mins, same with for example Bud doing it to DiVincenzo in his rookie year and now he is a starter, DeJounte Murray, Lonnie Walker all had to go through this as well  It's questionable i guess but that's how they operate, they want rookies to be eased in rather than fully play all the minutes even when bad"

Brogdon &amp; Siakam are in the same tier as Simmons right now (I would put Simmons ahead of them in that tier), and below that is the Caris Levert, Buddy Hield, Dejounte Murray tier.  Simmons is closer to these guys than he is to the top of this class, and if he doesn't figure out a way to impact the game in the half-court I could see more players leap-frogging him."

"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."
"Murray (I'm assuming he means Jamal and not Dejounte, even though the latter doesn't get enough respect) is such a wild card.  Like, obviously he's played worse than 3-4 of these guys, but two years in a row he's shown incredible things in the playoffs  How do you rate a dude who hasn't earned the right to coast, but seemingly turns it up  For what it's worth, I'm low on him since the Nuggets record isn't great rn and he hasn't played well.  If they were a healthy 2 seed or something, I'd excuse his play more."
"this is a really nice article detailing why were so high on our young guys. Keldon Johnson number one in blowby %, plus 2.5 minutes of KJ assaulting the rim embedded in the article. lonnie walker shooting his ass off. DeJounte Murray being an actual efficient point guard. i love it."
"They‚Äôve fallen off a bit but I still think the Spurs are up there with those other teams when it comes to player development. Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White developing like they have as the 29th picks of their respective drafts is nice."

I love DeJounte Murray
"up until this last game, Jakob Poetl was a nightmare. good enough defensively but worse than he was, while being arguably the worst offensive player in the league.  worst FT shooter in the league, terrified of getting fouled so instead of dunking he throws up hideous push shots and layups. he's had a couple good games in a row now so here's hoping it's turning around. on the positive end, I'm glad DeJounte Murray has improved as a passer.   I felt like he was officially a good distributing 2, at this point but he's honestly controlled the ball really well. he gets more possessions than DeRozan does and while he's less efficient, I'll take 5.4/2 ast/to from him in addition to his improved fourth quarter scoring. he leads the team in 4th quarter points do far."
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
Probably Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson. Aldridge's defense has gotten so bad I'm not even sure he's a top 4 player on our team anymore.
KJ and Dort are probably ineligible due to being 2nd year players.  Dejounte Murray has taken strides offensively l
"kennard is making more than DeJounte Murray and I still see dudes in our sub talking shit about DJs contract. people in general have no idea what a good contract is. and to be fair, Luke has been quite good when he's played but with the injuries and troubles getting back I would think he wouldn't get any MORE expensive if you waited until the off-season."

"He was mocked regularly in the teens, he was a big draft day fall similar to Dejounte Murray."
"May I introduce you to: Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and Lonnie Walker."
Dejounte Murray tore his ACL and was okay last season and looks much improved this season. Rudy Gay tore his ACL too and has been good in San Antonio off the bench and is in his 15th year now. ACL injuries aren't what they used to be.
"I think either Keldon Johnson or DeJounte Murray (so far).  Keldon seems like a for sure 10+ year player. His on-ball defense, his rebounding, his driving, his motor, it‚Äôs all already reeeally good. His 3pt flashes also seem like he can be a consistent 3pt threat too down the line. This is also essentially still his rookie year, as he only started playing in those 8 Bubble games the Spurs had. If he can learn how to create his own shot and draw more fouls, he will be a PROBLEM.  DeJounte Murray seems close but not over the hill of being a fringe All-Star. He‚Äôs good at drives, midrange shooting, on AND off ball defense, rebounding, and assisting. His problem is more his consistency. Some nights he‚Äôs brought it all and looks good, some nights he looks shook and awkward and lost. His motor and instincts need some work, and while he is a capable shooter and driver, it‚Äôs not reliable day in and day out. I believe he‚Äôll get there soon, maybe even later this season.  Lonnie has major potential, but I‚Äôm not the most optimistic of Spurs fans about him. His speed and athleticism are amazing, and the tools to be an elite shooter and scorer in the paint ARE THERE, however, I‚Äôm feeling less confident it‚Äôll all come to fruition. His BBIQ is low and his instincts are bad. So many times he second guesses himself, tries to do too much, and loses confidence in games. Pop always needs a ballhandler on the court with him because he (rightfully) doesn‚Äôt trust Lonnie to do things on his own. And while he‚Äôs still young and can improve on these, there doesn‚Äôt seem to have been any, so I‚Äôm not betting on it.  Devin Vassell looks great so far. He‚Äôs a prototypical long defensive wing with good instincts that can shoot from three. He reminds me a lot of Jerami Grant. He seems like a guarantee future starter in this league. Not much else to say about his ceiling yet since he hasn‚Äôt had that many minutes on the court, but almost all Spurs fans like him so far.  TLDR; Keldon or DeJounte."
"Not a Spurs fan, but I'm gonna say Dejounte Murray. He does everything."

"A couple of misses in the top 10, but the top 3 are pretty much spot on? Plus Jamal Murray in the top 10, Sabonis at 11, Malik Beasly at 19, Levert at 20, Siakam at 27, Dejounte Murray at 29, Brogdon at 36. It's not the deepest draft but it's not as bad as you're making it out to be I think."
"He has a very similar guarding profile to Dame - ideally the weakest perimeter player on the other team. But more flexible to taller players if that's the least dangerous matchup. I had a look at their top-15 respective matchups (based on [NBA tracking data](https://go.nba.com/bo3c)) by minutes played last season.  I can give you a more detailed breakdown if you want one, but to avoid an even longer wall of text, here's a summary (these are sums over the top-15 defensive assignments for each, positions from wikipedia):  * Luka spent 34:29 on PGs, 40:55 on PG/SG, 11:53 on SGs, 27:43 on SG/SF, and 52:36 on forwards who aren't even part-time guards. That is far more time on only-guards at 86:17 minutes compared to 52:36 on only-forwards, or about 64% more time on only-guards than only-forwards. * Dame spent 55:38 on PGs, 43:33 on PG/SG, 31:46 on SGs, 10:56 on SG/SF, and 36:21 across three different forwards who aren't even part-time guards. More time on players who are never-PGs than only-PGs. * Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both top-15 lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. * Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens. The only difference is that one is taller so the coach maybe has more flexibility in picking the more suitable guy to guard.  Also, this ""you are what you guard"" concept is a mess of a circular argument. But even if that is applied, Luka is certainly more of a guard than a forward. And since he's a guard, he's also clearly playing at on-ball/point rather than off-ball/shooting guard."
"Not quite... you generally change the last name to another player (usually a superstar) their playstyle is similar to. A quick google showed me that coming out of the draft, his closest comp was Dejounte Murray, a solid defensive guard.  Yet he nicknamed players might not sniff the skill level of the person they are named after (who knows if applicable to Olynyk?) So if you wanted to extrapolate that from Murray to a more accomplished/HoF player, you could say Maple Payton or whatever last name sounds cooler/makes sense. Maple Thomas, Maple Kidd, idk."
"People always been on about the free throw differential but its not the point this game  Watch the game over again and tell me that Dejounte Murray, Lamarcus Aldridge and Patty Mills weren't fouled more often then what they got? A combined 2 FTs between the 3. The refs refused to give it both ways this game."
Good game or not I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray
Dejounte isn't an elite defender. He's a little above average. Jamal Murray is clearly far better than him.

ladies love dejounte murray
It's probably going to have to require giving up at least 2 of the following:  Devin Vassell  Keldon Johnson   Derrick White  DeJounte Murray   This years pick. Whether it would require more draft capital would depend on which of these players   The fit is pristine though.
Zach Collins and Dejounte Murray got some good bone structure. Zach Lavine could steal my girl too
"Wanted to throw in DeJounte Murray into the conversation, hes been playing DPOY type defense and improved exponentially on offense. Not as flashy stats as Wood or Grant, but in terms of impact hes a huge reason for our success this year."
"They probably cast a vote and people chose him when they saw Murray thinking it was dejounte, and then they were confused but they‚Äôre like ‚Äúok if that‚Äôs what they want then we need an explanation‚Äù and that was what they came up with."
"For Collins, some possible packages:  Covington + GTJ  Aaron Gordon  MPJ  Dejounte Murray"
"If Zion's that much better then why does his team have such a worse record? Ingram is a better player than Dejounte Murray, DeMar's best teammate. The biggest problem with New Orleans is defense and Zion is a big part of the problem there."
Dejounte Murray for sure
He does. He also plays with Chris Paul. The Spurs second best player is dejounte Murray... This isn't to take any shots at DJ. He's an up-and-coming point guard for sure. The whole point he's making is DeMar DeRozan is by far the best player on the team with the ninth best record in the NBA and in some cases he's not even showing up on snublists let alone getting the All-Star recognition he rightfully deserved this year. I personally think Booker deserves it You guys have been great this year. I just don't personally think you guys should get two all-stars while the Spurs get zero based off expectations performance and roster construction.
"Dejounte Murray had 8 earlier in the season.   How do I know, because I own both in my fantasy team lol!"
"Draymond, Simmons, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac"
"A lot of good answers here, but I could see Dejounte Murray doing it"
"not the closest, but Dejounte Murray had 27/10/4/8 against the Warriors a few weeks ago  he could've easily had 10+ assists (instead of just 4) since he was dishing it to teammates throughout the 3rd and 4th but they weren't hitting their shots (i think Patty missed like three straight 3s off passes from DJ)  he also had 7 steals by the start of the 3rd quarter and got close to stealing it on numerous other ocassions but only deflected the ball out of bounds. i was really hoping that the ball was gonna get inbounded to Curry on the last possession because DJ looked ready to pick the pass off but then it got thrown to Draymond who threw up one of the worst shots i've ever seen"
Dejounte Murray had 7 a few weeks ago :)
"You left out Jason Terry &amp; Dejounte Murray.  Joe Harris, and Stockton born close enough.  Marvin Williams broke the mold though."
Just purely assuming considering Dejounte Murray is near the top of the league in defensive advanced stats.
"Bro, you're tied with the Spurs! LOL! Aldridge has missed a 3rd of the season and they're staring Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker! You're tied with a team that has a NEGATIVE SRS. LOL!  The Nuggets have a +5 SRS, and are underperforming their point differential by THREE GAMES! Don't be mad at me, be mad at your favorite team. LOL! TWO of your last 3 losses are to the Washington Wizards, LOL!"
It was meant to be dejounte Murray lol
Dejounte Murray

"Apparently it was a mistake, and they meant to list Dejounte Murray."
They stay disrespecting my man Blokab  Poeltl! Are we sure they didn't mean Dejounte Murray?
Is #8 on all nba ceiling referring to Jamal Murray or dejounte Murray? They‚Äôre both 24 and have the same last name. I‚Äôm assuming ur referring to Jamal but dejounte has been the real deal as of late so I‚Äôm not sure.
"He beat Dejounte Murray several times going to the rim and scored despite Poeltl , our best big defender, on the floor.  Idk if having our other starters on the floor could've changed the outcome.  Maybe."
I think Christian Wood or Dejounte Murray can take that MIP award then
"Yeah but he can‚Äôt really guard wings. There‚Äôs a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn‚Äôt move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I‚Äôm not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He‚Äôs been a lockdown defender in past season."
"Literally couldnt play any guards last week lol  Lost Jrue and Dejounte Murray to covid protocols, Simmons was a GTD to OUT for a bunch of games, picked up TJ McConnell and the Pacers immediately were PPD'd along w me losing Sabonis.   I had less than a handful of games from Powell and late week acquisition starts from Jingles and Josh Hart against the guy in 1st (im 2nd)"
DeJounte Murray made all-defense at...20? 21?
"I don't even mean this as an insult cause he's already nice but I think if you dropped Dejounte Murray into the 80s he'd be a nightmare to go against.  The league not focusing on the 3 ball back then would be great for him so he would just be locking dudes up, grabbing boards so he could run even more in transition and continue to use his great mid range shot in the half court."
"Why are people saying Spurs? Their past 5 picks have been good, not great. Vassell, Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, who else am I missing? None of these guys are really *great*. The answer here is quite easily Denver."
Yeah I'll back you up on this. We call Dejounte Murray DJ all the damn time in our subreddit.   Surprised a Spurs fan on reddit isn't aware of this. Even teammates call him DJ in interviews.

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.   Why didn‚Äôt they give him the last possession -_-
Dejounte Murray and the Austin Spurs almost pulled out the W. :(
Some of the cases people were making for Derozan allstar completely undermines how fcking good Dejounte Murray is this season.
Dejounte Murray is a literal God
"We are one, we are legion, we are Dejounte Murray simps"
Nothing is impossible with Dejounte Murray
"I just don't see how you could ever say he would *clearly* be the best player on the team when there's not much special about his game.   Especially when we have DeMar DeRozan that's still a walking bucket and should've been an All Star, Dejounte Murray whose still lockup on defense and finally a consistent offensive option, Keldon Johnson who is just an absolute monster, Derrick White, another extremely solid player on both ends and our best passer. Devin Vassell is a rookie and I think he has a bigger impact on both ends than Poetl.   Like yeah these advanced stats make him seem like he's top tier defensively but the eye test of watching him for the past 3 seasons doesn't really impress me."
Getting Tobias would've meant giving him that massive contract or letting him walk. That Smart contract would've had to have been 5M+ more than the celtics ended up paying him and the spurs already had Derrick White and Dejounte Murray as defensive minded guards. The difference between these trades is not much even if you think those trades are better. The lakers trade offer was Ingram and one pick. Possibly having the spurs having to take on Deng's contract. Kawhi tanked his trade value crazy hard.
"DeRozan averages 19.8/6.9/1.6 TOV on 60.3 TS%. Booker averages 24.7/4.3/3.5 TOV on 60.7 TS%. He definitely has an argument, especially considering Booker has CP3 setting him up while DeMar's best teammate this season has been Dejounte Murray."
Is he? DeMar averages 2.6 more assists and 1.5 less turnovers than Booker. They score at the same efficiency. Booker has CP3 setting him up while DeMar's best teammate has been Dejounte Murray.
Their efficiency is basically the same 60.7 vs 60.3 TS%. Booker is also averaging 1.5 more turnovers per game even though he averages 2.6 less assists per game. And Booker's best teammate has been Chris Paul while DeRozan's best teammate has been Dejounte Murray.
"I am not. We had that sort of player (only probably *better* defensively) back in 2018. Dejounte Murray. And his offense was problematic. To the point that even three years later, his offensive limitations are...limiting and frustrating.   Dort has been the same disappointing shooter for three years straight. He *isn't* showing development as a shooter."
Where is DeJounte Murray?
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
"I heard a lot of bad things about Dejounte Murray from people around the city that met him in the past, I hope that he's kinda grown up in that sense"
"Dejounte Murray made it in 17-18' only playing 20 minutes a game. For reference, Boogie tore his achilles that year 48 games in and played 6 fewer minutes.  edit: 2nd team"
Dejounte Murray is one of the most overlooked players in today‚Äôs game  I presume you‚Äôre referencing Jamal
"I cannot understand WHY does defense get overlooked so much when it is HALF the game lol.  How can Brooklyn even compete with Lakers when it's ""Big 3 vs Big 2"" BUT the 2 best defenders are on the Lakers side. So really it's Big 3 vs Big 4, and then the Lakers are much deeper bench wise. So I can't see the Nets winning maybe give them 20 percent chance but it's doubtful that series even goes 7 games.  Now who COULD be the team to upset Lakers???  In the Finals you could see Miami Heat upset the Lakers if Butler is Butler, Bam is Bam, and the supporting cast all shoots 40+ percent from 3 plus they keep up their ELITE DEF in the playoffs like last season. BAM with experience is scary he could match AD possibly, Jimmy can maybe even match an aging LeBron, so it might be cast vs cast and the Heat could have the slight edge if healthy with Precious Achiuwa the difference maker the X factor.  The SPURS??? Yes with Pop coaching and Tim Duncan experience beating the Lakers they can school the young Spurs how to beat the Lakers. Duncan knows how to get inside LeBron head he almost beat him 3 times in the finals. So yes they know LeBron secrets....and then you have the Big 3 of Dejounte, Derozan and LMA who are all very complimentary players. Murray is a DEF beast, Derozan is a leader, and LMA is a Vet. Not to mention the depth of guys like Gay, and Poetl and PATTY MILLS  The Sixers are the BEST team in the NBA this year. They have the MOST depth and the best players. The problem is coaching. Doc Rivers is a choke artist with the Clippers and Celtics. The 2008 win was in spite of him. Awful coach the guy doesn;t have a clue what he's doing out there.  So will the Lakers beat them?? Yes easily only because Doc Stinks. If Phil Jackson was coaching this Sixers team they EASILY win the chip. Embiid &gt; AD, and the Combo of Simmons/Tobias is good enough to match LeBron. Simmons on DEF and transition offense and Tobias with the clutch shooting like his game winner to beat Lakers this year."
Maybe Dejounte Murray in that group too
"Yeah but compare their other players' stats. LMA is def washed, way more than last season, but the rest of the Spurs' young core has stepped up massively (I especially fw Dejounte Murray). DeMar has become a way better playmaker though and hes actually a solid defender now? I still think the spurs would be an 8/9 seed if you replaced DeRozan with an average 2-way guard. Although he is playing great"
"Yeah the team that got keldon Johnson, Derrick white, and Dejounte Murray with 3 different 29th picks declining has to do with the front office, not a star player deciding to fuck us over lol  Being a GM in new York with a good owner is easy mode"
Dejounte Murray is better than any player Marks has drafted and so is Keldon Johnson.
"Since I haven't seen it here, Dejounte Murray could over the course of his career.    He recently had a game with 27 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 steals.  He has hit double-digits on assists in a few games this year and is improving as a playmaker.  I bet he comes close in the next 2-3 seasons."
Darkhorse for a quadruple double is Dejounte Murray imo
"Let's see:   * One or both of Kyrie/Harden * Dame * Steph  * Luka * Conley  * CP3 * Simmons  * Fox * Jrue * Trae  Then you have SGA/FVV (debate between being a SG or PG), Brogdon (probably better than Wall to start the season but dropped off lately), Dejounte Murray (probably not better than Wall but has a case because his defensive impact is greater), Ja (roughly around/slightly better than Wall, but has missed a lot of games), Jimmy (missed a lot of games and isn't a full-time PG), and Lowry (started slow but recently heated up.) So I think Wall is realistically in the 10-15 range."
Well this hurts Dejounte Murray fantasy owners... AKA me.
who is the dejounte murray simp?
Clippers chubby dude vs Dejounte Murray simp who wins?
"My centers are on point this year. Actually, if I can brag, I think my whole team is on point  Wall (pg)  Dejounte murray (pg/sg)  Donovan mitchell (pg/sg)  Vanvleet (pg/sg)  Huerter (sg/sf) (holding until levert recovers)  Hayward (sf)  Kyle Anderson (sf/pf)  Tatum (sf/pf)  Bam (pf/c)  Hortford (pf/c)  Drummond (c)"
"Yeah jokic is a monster. Top 3 centers off of average are jokic, embiid, and towns. Drummond was sitting at 3 but his production has obviously taken a hit.  I prefer guys with multiple position tags as it gives me more flexibility in setting up my daily 6 man roster. Having a huge logjam of guard (wall, mitchell, dejounte murray, vanvleet) and a pretty limited lineup of centers (bam and hortford) made sense to use steph as trade bait to balance out the roster.  I'm sitting in 4th place right now, guy I traded steph to is in last place lol. Good luck to you too!"

I assumed he's talking about Dejounte Murray??
"The reasons everyone is shiting on him is because everyone though he was going to be magic, but he is Dejounte Murray."
"Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker IV, Devin Vassel, Keldon Johnson, etc. Look, we ain‚Äôt all casuals. The thing is, it‚Äôs still way too early to tell what the final standings are. Just relax a bit"
"In fairness, he got a huge amount of his scoring in when both Dejounte and Derrick were sitting at the end of the first.  He went 5-6 on FTs, 3-3 on 2 pointers and 1-2 on 3 pointers in the last 6 minutes of the first quarter after Murray and White checked out to score 14 of his 25 on great efficiency. He shot 4-10, 1-5 from 3 and 2-2 from the line for his other 11 points."

Dejounte Murray
Obviously not the best metric.    Sabonis is 212th.  Nicolas Batum is 20th.    Keldon Johnson (who has been great for SA) is 231ist.  Mike Muscala is tied with Dejounte Murray.  Sexton and Siakam are 80 spots behind Cameron Johnson.  Etc.
Homer but man Dejounte Murray has to get at least second team.
Christian Wood is Top 1. Also Dejounte Murray deserves way more recognition than he‚Äôs getting.
"Kawhi, dejounte Murray, poetl, lebron, they're the few tht plays defense so I believe him"
"dejounte has had crazy games and he's playing up this season, but really think he's had a better career than murray so far?"

I‚Äôd be nervous as hell dribbling with Dejounte Murray guarding me. The guy is lanky as hell and quick as a cat. Having him on you seems like a bad time (ask kemba walker)
It‚Äôs Dejounte Murray not Jamal lol
Dejounte ‚ÄúLiAngelo Ball‚Äù Murray
NBA fans know Dejounte Murray! But no one calls him DJ outside of the Spurs organization/fan base which is why people are really confused about your original comment. But he‚Äôs a great young talent maybe he‚Äôll get to the point where people know him by that nickname.

"He‚Äôs on the Spurs; Pop traditionally has rookies on a shorter leash, and they‚Äôre stacked at G/F with Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Demar, Keldon Johnson, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay. He‚Äôs averaging 17 minutes a game, which isn‚Äôt terrible, but it‚Äôs the least of any lottery player besides Okongwu, Toppin, Jalen Smith, Kira Lewis, and Nesmith. Those guys suffer the same problem as Vassell- being stuck in the rotation due to roster depth- but I also think they‚Äôre significantly worse than Vassell."
"For whatever reason that 2018ish roster of Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, Bryan Forbes and Derrick White all seemed like one interchangeable person."
"Pop wanted to move to younger blood in Dejounte Murray and the Hornets offered him more money and minutes, it's not uncommon for Pop to tell his players to go get paid if he knows he won't play them as much"
"Doing more than 10 because I want to:   Jrue, Dort, Ben Simmons, Giannis, Gobert, Marcus Smart, Bam, OG, Draymond, Embiid, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi, Myles Turner, Dejounte Murray"

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.   Consistency: What is it?
"&gt; As it is, you have an aging team who‚Äôs tried to compete for the last four years, and the best they could manage was the 7 seed  This is the youngest roster Pop has ever coached.  We've been rebuilding in place since our franchise player forced his way out, and are plenty happy with how we've drafted and developed players while actually trying to win games.  It's also misleading to ignore how much more difficult it is to advance up the board in the West.  &gt; We drafted an all-star, two very good players, and a number of role players and got to watch them grow.  A little reductive to called Luka Donƒçiƒá an All Star, honestly.  But seriously, I really do enjoy watching Young play and think he's got clear comparisons to Steve Nash.  It's just bizarre to me that Hawks fans insist on pointing out that the guy they essentially drafted 3rd overall is better than the 29th pick we found at a culinary school.  It's not like Pels fans need to remind everyone that Zion is, in fact, better than Luka Samaniƒá.  &gt; So I‚Äôd say Hawks fans are happy w/ the result of the last four years. Can you say the same thing about the Spurs? You enjoy losing those 7 seeds that much?  I can't speak for them, but I somehow doubt the average Hawks fan has enjoyed watching Hawks basketball the past four seasons, if they bother tuning in at all.  Kudos to those who do, but I don't blame anyone for choosing to skip watching a bad team play meaningless games.  As for us, it's great watching our guys develop together and gain real experience in the playoffs.  Watching the steady trajectory of genuinely likable blue-collar guys like Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Luka Samaniƒá, Lonnie Walker IV, Drew Eubanks, and Devin Vassell is a treat.  While I don't think anyone on our current roster can be the centerpiece of a championship roster, they absolutely have the chops to compliment that kind of player."
"I think the reason why Derozan has had the opportunity to showcase and develop his passing ability with the Spurs was because of the massive amount of injuries to their PG rotation during the beginning of the 2018-2019 season.  During that season Dejounte Murray was out with an ACL injury, and Derrick White was out with a foot injury.  That forced the Spurs to start the undrafted Bryn Forbes as their ""point guard"" alongside Derozan.  During that time the Spurs had no legitimate point guard, so Derozan took the PG responsibility and performed admirably.   Even Pop himself stated that he had no idea Derozan was that good of a passer until then.   So overall it's a complex situation of Derozan proving himself able to shoulder the playmaking responsibility and the Spurs starting to use that skill of his."
"Exactly, the looks the Nets got in this video would be taken by 3 point snipers DeMar Derozan and Dejounte Murray. LMA just doesn‚Äôt fit when you have two starters who can‚Äôt shoot from the 3 point line"
I think the majority that said hes washed was because they didnt watch the Spurs  Dude was great offensively but the balance of average/good/great shooters on the Nets squad compared to 3 point snipers DeMar Derozan and Dejounte Murray and its just obvious why LMA wasn't great for the Spurs. His defense will still be bad but dude will score and create opportunities for others.

The Spurs might be about to do it again.  Dejounte Murray - 29th in 2016  Derrick White - 29th in 2017  Lonnie Walker - 18th in 2018  Luka Samanic - 19th in 2019  Keldon Johnson - 29th in 2019  Devin Vassell - 11th in 2020  All of which are really solid pieces. We're just lacking that franchise cornerstone at the moment so I hope one of these guys completely breaks out.

"So, you dislike parity?  There is a lot of basketball tonight and fun games for people that care about more than just primetime matchups:  If you're into playoff positioning, Heat/Knicks match up tonight and are only 2 games apart in the standings.  Miami is reeling while the Knicks have won 3 in a row.  If you want to watch a bunch of all-stars put up numbers, Zion, Tatum, and Ingram is plenty of star power to watch.   We also get to see how Fournier fits.  If you just want a marquee Finals preview, Clips/Bucks is obviously the game of the night.  If you want to see a lowkey great individual matchup, the Kings have won four straight and Fox is red hot.  Now he gets to play against Dejounte Murray, who has been all-world defensively this year.  I'll be watching Warriors/Bulls, because I'm excited to see if the Bulls can make a playoff push with Vuc.  Plus, Curry may come back."
"DeRozan got snubbed, but he is all star caliber. Spurs have a very balanced and talented young team right now and will make the playoffs. People used to say similar things about Kawhi when he was on the spurs. I'm not saying the spurs have another Kawhi, but they do have very promising talent in Keldon johnson, vassell, Lonnie walker, dejounte murray, derrick white... That defense...."

"I'm with you on this one. Don't get me wrong. I think he's a great player, but I don't see how he can be successful in the postseason. Not only do small guys get picked on defensively, but they just get beaten up over a series. The smaller you are, the harder it is to sustain excellence at this level. Look at Kemba. He took a step back at the beginning of the season and was awful. I hope this isn't discredited because of my flair because I really do like Trae Young. He's a great player, but I don't think his game translates to the playoffs.  Having said all that, I don't know that I agree that Dejounte Murray will ever be better. If he is, that's great for him, but I don't see how he could get there."
"DeJounte Murray is a better overall player and will have a more successful. in terms of wins, career than Trae Young although they will never be mentioned in the same tier. The Spurs have a stud."

"Dejounte Murray is **by far** the greatest underachieving, underperforming player in the association. The arguably comical and enigmatic aspect to this is that the dude doesn't lay undisputed and uncontested claim to this title because of character or lack of effort etc...  One day this guy is gonna say ""Imma done with this overthinking and second guessing and playing scared/playing to please Pop and others"".  And all you clowns will find yourself witnessing something so much more than what you ever imagined possible.   One day this dude is gonna say ""fuck this, I'm taking over"" and the league will be forever changed.   Dude is literally performing at I'd estimate around  .1% of his true performance/talent level. He's barely a shell of his future self.  Remember that circus shot he hits every game...that is a realistic DJ ceiling. Not Hyperbole.  Mark my words."

They can be a higher seed if they can land someone like Gary Trent in the offseason but even without major FA additions, they are good enough to make it."
"Having Looney, an average bench player, be your best player in a 5 year stretch is horrible. McCaw and Bell suck and only seemed serviceable playing on the best team ever.  The Spurs had low draft picks on the same years and drafted Dejounte Murray and Derrick White with the 29th pick.  Warriors also passed on Lamelo when all the most respected draft experts had him number 1."
"It doesn't make sense on paper for the spurs at all. We already have Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Patty Mills, and DeMar DeRozan running the offense."
"The real problem is the fool that confused everyone didn't even use initials properly, abbreviating Dejounte Murray as DJ. BG might as well be Andrew Bargnani then."

Dejounte Murray made it a couple years ago averaging 21.5 minutes a game and Thybulle is absolutely a better defender than him.
"""You will rue this day, James Harden!"" - Dejounte Murray probably"
"Watch the video again, his foot only moves after Dejounte Murray made contact with his calf first."
He‚Äôs good enough that it SHOULD be beneath him to play dirty and trip Dejounte Murray.

Harden has always hated Dejounte since the 2017 playoffs game 6. When a rookie Murray made Harden look stupid
Currently: DeJounte Murray  All Time: I‚Äôd say George Gervin. Iceman is one of the greatest scorers in league history.
"Thybulle and Caruso have really good arguments for All-Defense but they each play around 20 minutes per game so they aren't locks. But, Dejounte Murray and Bogut made All-Defense teams recently playing 21.5 and 23.5 minutes per game so it's not unprecedented."

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray   And the rest of the team goddamn
It doesn't necessarily mean those things. This would be our rotation:  Murray / Mills / Jones  White / Vassell  Johnson / Walker  Robinson / Free Agent / Samanic  Poeltl / Free agent or Eubanks  No matter what we're overloaded at the 2 spot if you only want to play Vassell and Walker there because of Dejounte and Derrick. Vassell has to play 3 sometimes for the rotation to work.
Dejounte Murray got voted in averaging only 21.5 MPG a few years ago so you never know
"Skill Boost to DeJounte Murray, make him a mid range god (like cp3 or derozan)  Athleticism to Lonnie Walker, maybe he'll dunk from the 3 point line  3 Inches to Keldon Big Body Johnson, for obvious reasons"
"I think Tim Duncan is a top 10 player of all time but putting him in the GOAT conversation is overrating him. Some of those All-nba he got towards the end was when the center position was incredibly weak and he wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. Both of his MVPs where extremely close and he probably should only have won one. Best winrate in the NBA probably has more to do with the fact that he was always surrounded with a good team. What happened after duncan retired? the spurs won 61, 47(kawhi missed the first 27 games), 48 (no Dejounte Murray) games right around 50ish games each season, probably has more to do with pop being a great coach then it does with duncan. Duncan is also the only NBA center to fail to win an Olympic Gold medal -- and the 2004 Team USA he captained was a complete embarrassment, somehow getting blown out by Puerto Rico, which is obviously a US territory. I find Duncan to be overrated on the defensive end, often times he wasn't even the best defender on his own team. He only occasionally was the leading vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners, and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"Not the first to mention this, but there is precedent with low playing time. Dejounte Murray made second team in 2018 averaging 21.5 min; Thybulle currently averages 20 min."

"A ton. Devin Booker, DeJounte Murray, Jamal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas to name a few."
"All those negative things you just said about him are probably accurate...and yet he still works everybody except Simmons and possibly Mikal Bridges (jury is still out there, but he finally conquered Dejounte Murray by posting him up this year).  I think that either next season or the season after, Luka will get into better shape.  This should help his free throws and transition game especially."

"Ben Simmons, Dejounte Murray, and similar players developing a reliable long range shot."
"He's only playing 20 minutes per game, that's not even half the game, then again Dejounte Murray made it playing 22 minutes per game,it was ridiculous IMO, but it means it's possible"
"Idk how Dejounte Murray fell in the Spurs lap. He was getting mocked twice as high as he ended up going (peaked at 10, averaged about 14, I think he went in the 20's). He wasn't injured to my knowledge.  Edit: I thought you meant in the draft, my bad"
"For context, a couple of players that shoot about 3 3s a game at \~33% are Solomon Hill, Andre Iguodala, and Dejounte Murray."
"Before that was BRoy, Spencer Hawes, Martell Webster (from Seattle and was supposed to go to UW before he went pro), IT, Justin Holiday, Terrence Ross, and Dejounte Murray. Most of them were local guys on top of all that. Guess you can also include players like Lavine, Joe Harris, Kevin Porter Jr., etc.  Crazy how we still don‚Äôt have a team even when we‚Äôre putting out the type of talent that we are here in the PNW."
No Dejounte Murray smh totally unreasonable. ESPN has finally gone too far
I didn't know you were a Spurs fan until you said Dejounte Murray
"Uhhhhhh us? We‚Äôve been too good to get a good draft pick but not good enough to be a playoff team. We‚Äôll most likely lose all of our vets this off-season and our best player is most likely going to be Dejounte Murray whose best case scenario is the 5th best player on a championship team. We have 100 guards who all have the same game and we‚Äôre banking on no name mid level players to be our future(Luka, Tre, Lonnie)"
"I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.   This team is hard to watch. Just taking Ls ever since the team came down with Covid, then LMA getting bought out, then the brutal post ASG schedule. My dad has been telling me since like 2008 that one day the Spurs will be bad and whew lad it‚Äôs now. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me I‚Äôm going to watch The Beautiful Game for the 100th time and eat ice cream.   If any of my Spurs fan homies want to do the same: https://youtu.be/T3y7cWmoBCI"
"It's not like Dejounte was purposely guarding Ingles, it was just what happened in transition or off switches. You would think an older forward like Ingles would use his size to deal with Dejounte's defense, but he was easily getting free lanes to the rim when Dejounte was guarding him.  Murray has definitely been better than White on defense this year but yeah I thought Derrick was better last year and think he will probably be better next year.  The main reason for our defense this year is because of Jakob. I think players will start respecting him more next year though and our defense will take a hit because of it."
"People talk about Dejounte Murray like he's amazing on defense and while he does play amazing defense occasionally, for the most part he's average to slightly above average. Just the last game he played, he was constantly letting Joe Ingles blow by him. Guys like Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday are far better defenders than him."
"The voting process for the All Team selections is pretty garbage. Like l stated, it's a popularity contest. There's no reason a guard like Jrue Holiday only has 2 All Defensive team selections when players all over the league (Damian Lillard, KD, JJ Reddick, Andre Igudola, etc.) say he's the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  Same thing with Jonathan Issac, Tony Allen for some early years, Jimmy Butler, Avery Bradley, AK-47, Robert Covington, and plenty of other players who were shafted in place of bigger names.  An NBA game is 48 minutes star players typically play 75% of that at 36mpg which is also where most of a games production occurs. If he is playing 20+ mpg  during productive stretches on the best team in his conference, which is also a title contender, l don't see how he isn't in the conversation. He plays ~10 minutes less than Ben (DPOY candidate) and Joel (an MVP candidate). That's less than a game's quarter. He has a plus / minus that shows his impact and it's all on the defensive end.  Dejounte Murray played roughly the same amount when he was selected. Tony Allen and PatBev had similar minutes as well in their years.  Don't look at other NBA outlets and analyst, see what the people he guards say about his defense. I presented the stats now go listen to his peers."
I'm referring to most metrics not just raptor. You can play 20 minutes a game and still be good enough for all defense. Pat Bev made 2nd team last year playing only 26. DeJounte Murray made 2nd team in 2018 playing 21 minutes. So a 20 minute threshold is actually a pretty good measure.

"As much as rebounds are devalued in the modern nba with people jacking 3s and no one crashing the offensive glass, it still takes a lot of hustle to chase rebounds night in night out. While as much as I think his rebounding is overrated, it's no small feat to do that night after night.

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray. That rest tho üò§
Dejounte Murray made a team with comparable minutes iirc
"I don't really agree with you, but Dejounte Murray got all D playing similar minutes."
"and secondarily, DeJounte Murray as well. he isn't Chris Paul but for him to even be a league average playmaker on top of his off the bounce jumper looking better, his theoretical ceiling has clearly elevated to another level from before the ACL tears."

Dejounte Murray doesn't do this what are you on?
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray
i really really hope its optimistic like that..everyone was mentioning how  Dejounte Murray took 2 years to recover :&lt; . And ofc when you recover and you are back its question can you keep playing well like you did before
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray   Him getting a triple double: :D  Losing to another undermanned team: D:
"Spurs fans, is Dejounte Murray having a breakout year, and what do you guys think his full potential is?"
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray
"I feel as though in the end, Murray will be just as good as he was and will continue improving. Only thing is, how long will that take? Nuggets don‚Äôt have infinite time to work with, they‚Äôre supposed to be win now, and it‚Äôll take him 10ish months minimum just to get back on the court. And he‚Äôs not gonna immediately return to form. Lavine ended up better than he ever was, but he struggled at first when he came back. Same with Dejounte Murray. There‚Äôs a good chance that Murray comes back towards the end of next season but is a shell of himself for a few months, and by the time he gets back to normal the playoffs will be over."
"   &gt;Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray   &gt;   &gt;If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo.     What is this crap? YOU are the one underrating Dlo, Lonzo is certainly not better than Dlo, Murray isnt, maybe Conley is, and Shai is."
"Yes I'd take Dlo over Lonzo Ball and Dejounte Murray. Maybe even Mike Conley.   Lonzo plays with Zion and B.I so gets goods looks from 3s. He wishes he is even half the offensive player Dlo is, and his half-court offense doesn't even compare to Dlo's. I'll take Zo for the rebounds and defense though."
"&gt; nobody overrates dlo   Anyone who thinks he's good is PG is overrating him. Casual fans still consider him a star.  Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray  If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo."
"I'd have to agree. The number of good/solid players they've been able to draft at the end of the 1st has been insane.  Just the past 7 years they've drafted 5:  Kyle Anderson #30  Dejounte Murray #29  Derrick White #29  Lonnie Walker #18  Keldon Johnson #29  However, the Spurs also have an incredible coaching and development staff, and it would be hard to say how well these guys would have done in other places. Meanwhile, my franchise routinely blows top lottery picks on guys like Dunn and Culver."
"I feel like it‚Äôs more common for young guys to tear their ACL and end up fine (Zach Lavine, Dejounte Murray, etc) but even then they‚Äôre garbage when they return and spend the greater part of a season getting back to where they once were, only then do they start improving again."
Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson gonna be up there soon.
Dejounte Murray is one good offseason away from getting MVP votes
Just like with Dejounte Murray 2 or 3 years ago I find it ridiculous to put a guy who is not even playing half of the game...
"Well, it was the 2016-2017 season, and my graduating class was the class of 2016 so I guess it was my first year of college. Regardless, y'all are mediocre, your HOF coach is about to retire, and your main building block of the future is Dejounte Murray. You can talk shit about other teams when you're good, but talking shit when your team is 6 games under .500, hasn't won a playoff series in 4 years, and is still trending downwards is cringe."
"Who‚Äôs y‚Äôall third team? Dejounte Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Capela is mine I think"
I would take Dejounte Murray over him on defense
Probably thinking of Dejounte Murray not Jamal Murray
"Yeah, for sure it is but two or three of them will have to become borderline all star level. Kinda like the 04 Pistons.  Dejounte is a delight to watch and I think White can be as good of a third/fourth option as you can hope for but even if Murray can reach his potential (current level of Morant and Fox?) there's still other shoes to fill in other positions and you're not winning anything without someone holding their own in the front court."
"&gt; EDIT: Like what do you call Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Goran Dragic, FVV, Dejounte Murray, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela  those are all role players lol, you can make an arbitrary separation between ""role player"" and ""role player who starts and has a bigger role"" if you want, but by all accounts they are still role players. Other than Dragic is there one allstar on that list?  By your definition, someone like Lou Dort stopped being a role player once he started and got the green light to take more than 9-10 shots a game. OG Anunoby isn't a role player because he starts and plays multiple roles on the court? A 3&amp;D player is basically the most sought after role player and that's a guy who can pass decently, drive decently, shoot very good, play defense very good. That's a multi-faceted player (Covington, Beverly, etc.) yet still a role player."
"&gt;There are guys making that much or a couple mil more that you'd easily rather have.  Only one veteran player averaged more assists than Schroder, and made less this past season.  Ballhandling and playmaking is arguably the most in-demand skill in the NBA.  Lots of players can shoot, and lots can rebound.  Only a few can create shots for themselves and others, and those players tend to be handsomely rewarded.  The only veterans who averaged 5+ assists and made under $20m last season were; Schroder, Lonzo Ball, TJ McConnell, Ricky Rubio, and Dejounte Murray.  &gt;I bet he gets something more like Dejounte Murray.  Murray is an even worse shooter than Schroder, and had nothing remotely resembling Schroder's resume when he signed that contract.  Murray is not even a comparable.  At the time Murray signed that deal, his career high was 8.1 ppg.  And he still got 4 x $16m."
"Lol he gets blown by all the time, Murray isnt a good defender, unless you are talking about dejounte"
DeJounte Murray is playing this series?  Who knew!?
If Seattle gets a team I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be able to get guys in free agency that are originally from there like a Dejounte Murray for example
Current: Dejounte Murray  Current Non-Spur: Stephen Curry  All-Time: Tim Duncan  All-Time Non-Spur: Michael Jordan
Current: Dejounte Murray  All-Time: Tim Duncan
"Dejounte Murray (because of age), Malcolm, Bogi, FVV, Terry Rozier."
2016 is a weird draft because it has a lot of talented borderline stars who all feel like they're just not quite there.   - Simmons   - Ingram   - Brown   - Murray   - Sabonis   - Siakam   - Dejounte Murray   - Brogdan   There's a lot of guys who seem like they could be the second or third best player on a champion but not the first.
"Some candidates: Dejounte Murray (4/64 through 23-24), Poeltl (3/26 through 22-23), LaVine (4/78 through 21-22), Clarkson (4/52 through 23-24), Zubac (3/21 through 22-23), Wood (3/41 through 22-23), Dort (4/5 through 22-23)  This isn‚Äôt a comprehensive list, and some are clearly better than others, but those are some of the better ones I can think of."
"I know I‚Äôm forgetting guys from further back, but off the top of my head Bryn Forbes, Bertans, Danny Green, and Cory Joseph come to mind. Jonathan Simmons was a really cool story. I know Spurs were the first to bring Boban to the league from Europe. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray don‚Äôt fit the criteria but as far as development goes they seem to be on a good trajectory so far. And in addition to Manu I do think TP and Kawhi are major scouting and development success stories.  I think the main thing is that they haven‚Äôt had a lottery pick in a long time, but stayed dominant by scouting and forming high-caliber role players and even stars. I‚Äôm not sure that Manu, TP, and Kawhi get to be among the very best players in the league if not for playing with the Spurs."
"I don't think the spurs would trade White or Murray. Pop said like over a year ago that he's the most important player on the team and Dejounte is the leader of the lockerroom and has improved substantially every healthy offseason he's had. They would rather gamble in free agency than give up Derrick or Dejounte to get Kemba imo.  I was imagining more like the spurs would take Kemba's contract for no salary but since the celtics are so far over the cap right now, that doesn't make much sense for them."
Well that means losing either Derrick White or Dejounte Murray depending on who you ask assuming you're not including free agents. I'd say no considering both of them make about half what Porzingis does. Dejounte is the clear leader of the spurs locker room and the front office loves him. Derrick is a very good player who every team would want. His only problem is staying healthy. Porzingis has easily the highest potential of these guys but that contract plus his health is risky.
Dejounte Murray is not good enough to be on this team Pop wouldn‚Äôt have added him.
Dejounte murray
"DoesNot matter, Pop will take dejounte Murray and Derrick white over everyone"
I don't know if anyone else gives a shit how good DeJounte Murray was this year at the moment lol so I think all the non playoff teams are just keeping to themselves waiting for the offseason.
"""I Have Nothing To Do With This And JH Already Cleared Up The Trip Incident In Real Life So I Hope His Injury Isn‚Äôt Nothing Serious So He Can Come Back And Help His Team Compete For A Championship!!!!!"", a novel by best-selling author Dejounte Murray"
Who is Dejounte Murray?
"I mean i think Pop did an amazing job with this years Spurs. The top 5 minutes played on the Spurs were Dejounte Murray, Derozan, Keldon Johnson, Poetl, and Patty Mills.   They still got the 10th seed and for the better part of the season were in the 8th seed ahead of GS until Covid hit them and they lost Derrick White for the season after he only played 30ish games.   1) DJM - elite defensive player with no consistent outside shot  2) Derozan - sucks on defense, has no outside shot   3) Keldon Johnson - effecxtively a rookie with no outside shot   4) Poetl - good on defense, no offensive game outside of rolling to the baskett   5) Mills - career 6th man   He still took this team to a record better than the Pelicans with BI/Zion, Kings with Fox, Hield, Barnes, Haliburton, and was close to the Warriors who had an MVP candidate, Celtics who had Jaylen/Jayson, etc."
"For sure allonzo trier, Zach Lavine, dejounte Murray, MPJ, Matisse thybull, IT, etc etc  Anyone who spent time around  around Seattle is welcome. Even klay going to WSU haha"
Who's ready for 2022 Finals Tyler Herro v. Dejounte Murray
Dejounte Murray is one great offseason away from turning into an MVP candidate
we forgive you. now give us dejounte murray for your sins
"Tyrese Haliburton, OG Anunoby, Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Lu Dort, Dejounte Murray"
"Deandre Hunter, Dejounte Murray, Thybulle, Kyle Anderson, Lauri, Gallo"
"Okay I thought that might‚Äôve been the case, thanks man. That boy dejounte Murray is a PROBLEM"
"Lol completely don‚Äôt mention still prime Aldridge and pre-ACL tear Dejounte Murray, who had just become the youngest player named to an ALL NBA defensive team since Kobe, but sure kid  Edit: Not to mention Tony Parker, a HOFer as backup PG üòÇ"
"As others pointed out, your numbers are wrong - you‚Äôre looking at playoff RPG this season, which is obviously a tiny sample size. So let‚Äôs compare Luka and Westbrook in the regular season.   In the regular season, 23.9% of Luka‚Äôs rebounds are contested compared to 24.5% of Westbrook‚Äôs.  Among players with 6 or more rebounds per game, Dejounte Murray (22.6%), Middleton (20.7%), Harden (20.4%), Paul George (20.3%), LeBron (18.8%) and Tatum (18.4%) all have lower contest % than Luka or Westbrook but it‚Äôs really mostly those two that are accused of stat padding rebounds"
I bought Dejounte Murray stock when he got drafted and have holden ever since.
CJ and a pick for Dejounte Murray?
Dejounte Murray got in playing 21 minutes
"&gt;Compared to the dozens of top FA lining up to sign in Seattle  They cannot lineup with no franchise.  That said, Zach LaVine, Dejounte Murray, and Kevin Porter, Jr are all from Washington.  Any two of those three might be a real decent backcourt.  &gt;They have a better shot of recruiting players in LA than Seattle, this is common sense  In 20 years of Sonics' basketball during the UFA era, their record was not that much worse than the Clippers' record in 32 years.  The Sonics signed Terry Cummings, Vernon Maxwell, and Chuck Person, among others.  And that was without Ballmer's nearly bottomless funds."
"I think Miami actually makes an interesting offer for the Clips. Any number of Bam, Herro, Duncan (S&amp;T), or Dragic could head to LA.   Same with Atlanta. Collins and Hunter would be an interesting trade.  San Antonio could give the Clippers DeMar Derozan and DeJounte Murray for PG"
"It‚Äôs why you should never judge a player by their first few years.. there‚Äôs like 10 good to great players in that draft   Simmons, Brown, Ingram, Siakam, Jamal Murray, Vanvleet, Sabonis, Levert, Dejounte Murray, Brogdon"
From the young up comers Dejounte Murray but prolly cuz no one watches the spurs
I‚Äôm pretty sure Dejounte Murray also got one lol. So they‚Äôre tied unless I‚Äôm forgetting someone else that got one?
Dejounte Murray is a draw b
Dejounte Murray was actually the first

Dejounte Murray with the worst triple-double of all-time.
It‚Äôs Dejounte Murray time üòé
any team with average shooters would love to have this guy  the problem he struggled here is because the paint is consistently flooded and his passes always end up going back to 3 point snipers Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson
"I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray even in the off season. Frustrating season but hey, the lotto isn‚Äôt so bad. Good luck Grizz"
"Dejounte Murray, that was not a good triple double!"
Can someone **PLEASE** do a remake [of this Bootum classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyhY8tt8bcw) but replace Lowry with Dejounte Murray after tonights performance? 5/20 is downright brutal. I feel for DeRozan but woof gotta be the most well-known poor performer in the playoffs amongst stars alongside Eric Bledsoe.
Dejounte Murray has a triple double lol
Lonnie Walker IV and Dejounte Murray

"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Jakob Poeltl, Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Tre Jones. I feel like Eubanks would certainly be taken from us. He is a decent backup 5 on a minimum for two more years."
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Poeltl, Keldon, Lonnie Walker, Vasell, Samanic and because we need an eighth player Drew Eubanks, but that's literally everyone we have under contract for next season  Edit: Swap Drewbanks with Tre Jones, forgot about him"
"Dude point guard the deepest position, schroeder definitely is below median for starting point guards.

They passed on:  Jamal Murray  Buddy Hield  Pascal Siakam  Dejounte Murray  Sabonis
"It‚Äôs not about the scoreboard, it‚Äôs about how they looked in that loss. They had zero answer for Anthony Davis, inside or outside.  It‚Äôs pretty different than Keldon Johnson, Drew Eubanks, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell all going off at the same ."

I have no clue what guys like Derrick White and Dejounte Murray have to do with my comment
"I think Tim Duncan is a top 10 player of all time but putting him in the Top 5 is overrating him. Some of those All-nba he got towards the end was when the center position was incredibly weak and he wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. Both of his MVPs where extremely close and he probably should only have won one. Best winrate in the NBA probably has more to do with the fact that he was always surrounded with a good team. What happened after duncan retired? the spurs won 61, 47(kawhi missed the first 27 games), 48 (no Dejounte Murray) games right around 50ish games each season, probably has more to do with pop being a great coach then it does with duncan. Duncan is also the only NBA center to fail to win an Olympic Gold medal -- and the 2004 Team USA he captained was a complete embarrassment, somehow getting blown out by Puerto Rico, which is obviously a US territory. I find Duncan to be overrated on the defensive end, often times he wasn't even the best defender on his own team. He only occasionally was the leading vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners, and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"I think Siakam and Ben are still in the mix.  I‚Äôd say  Tier 1A: Brown, Siakam, Murray, Simmons, Siakam Tier 1B: Ingram, Sabonis  Tier C: LeVert, Dejounte, Brogdon, Beasley, Zubac"
"I think whatever team ends up paying Schroder what he's looking for is going to come to regret it and be burdened with a bad contract for 4 years. Of the 4 you listed, I'd go after Ball-&gt;Lowry-&gt;Dinwiddie, my dream pairing is Dejounte Murray but other teams would have to be involved for that to work out"
"Terrifying game. Never want to see Patty 'Steph Curry' Mills, Rudy 'Steph Curry' Gay or Dejounte 'Steph Curry' Murray again."
A lot of people in our sub wanted Dejounte Murray with the article that came out last week but now I want KJ lol. Every Spurs game I watched last year either Murray or KJ were doing some incredibly fun things with great ball movement. Those 2 have a bright future.
hopefully a good defender so probably dejounte murray
"Derrick White was definitely the wrong pick. If he picked Dejounte Murray, that's a solid choice instead of Fox."
"Jrue is a good defender, but if I want a one way defender, I won‚Äôt pay 30 million and give up 7 picks for one.  I‚Äôll just trade bledsoe and a pick for Marcus smart or dejounte Murray who are younger, play elite defense, and are also bigger so they can switch onto wings.   We chose jrue because he can run a halfcourt offense well and is a threat off of screens.   If he doesn‚Äôt play like that, we were better off with just getting a good defensive guard and paying him 15 a year,"
Isn't 25 million a huge ass overpay for someone like Lonzo? Isn't his contract closer to someone like Dejounte Murray?
"Every defensive metric certainly doesn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs below average. That‚Äôs just wrong.  He was in the 60th percentile of d-epm. Tatum was in 54th along with Middleton, below average would be like Lowry in the 46th percentile of Dame in the 33rd. Jaylen‚Äôs closer to Mikal Bridges, Steven Adams, and KD among others than he is to being below average.  He‚Äôs above average in d-raptor too for this past regular season. Some guys below him (below average with numbers in the negative) include KD,  RJ Barrett, Siakam, Middleton, Lowry, CP3, and Tatum. The difference between him and Tatum was more than the difference between him and Dejounte Murray, Lebron, Lonzo, Ayton and Adams as well as equal to the difference between him and Mikal Bridges and Jrue. He‚Äôs historically been above average in raptor too.  The stat he generally doesn‚Äôt look good in is regular season dbpm but even that doesn‚Äôt carry over to his postseason numbers. He also generally raises his game in the postseason. While playing less games than the Miami Heat players, he had the 4th highest total defensive win shares last postseason after Tatum, Lebron, and AD."
"Sounds like you need someone in the mould of Jrue Holiday, SGA or even Dejounte Murray more but I guess Lonzo is the closest thing to that available in FA rn.   Would you consider putting a package together for Dame instead? Obvs not the same type of player but that would be a helluva swing and you can focus on putting elite guard/wing defenders in the rotation? With Dame and Zach being your primary ball handlers and scorers"
Yeah this is clearly favoritism. And I mean yeah he provides defense i guess but they need a playmaker too. Even if you gonna pick a Spurs player get Derrick White or Dejounte Murray then
nah but seriously can we get Dejounte Murray instead
was Dejounte Murray not an option üò¢
Dejounte Murray
Dejounte Murray
Fuk Shaw I want dejounte murray
here you gonna see bulls fans absolutely trashing tf out lauri but than come out and say that a S&amp;T for Dejounte Murray is fair lmao
"If you Google Dejounte Murray every article is about trade rumors, not sure why you think he isn‚Äôt being targeted"
"Dejounte Murray breaks out a la Julius Randle this season and gets the Spurs back into the playoffs  Timberwolves make the playoffs  CP3 leaves Phoenix but they're still really good, win ~55 games  The Pelicans are still mediocre and Zion gets increasingly sad  Knicks don't replicate the magic from last season and are bang average going close to .500  Raptors bounce back and get home court advantage in the first round  Lillard starts the season in Portland but things go south quick and they end up being rather bad, winning ~35 games  Kyle Kuzma gets traded and has a borderline AS season, earning him the MIP"
"I‚Äôd go with AD, Tatum, PG, Butler, and Kawhi even if Kawhi can‚Äôt defend at the same level as before in no particular order.  Klay needs to come back before I add him.  KD is just below those guys.  Jaylen is not there yet defensively (he‚Äôs great at 1 on 1 defense though).  I‚Äôd put Pascal Siakam, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jaren Jackson Jr (assuming he comes back to what he was in the 2019-2020 season), and Dejounte Murray over Tobias."
"imo let the old vets walk except for rudy gay, yes the spurs should move on from patty mills as well even if he's a spurs legend. and don't trade either derrick white or dejounte murray nor any of the young guys unless they're getting a star in return."
"He‚Äôs a lower level all star, there‚Äôs not many Allstars from last year I‚Äôd trade for him straight up. Not sure how the salaries line up but I think dejounte Murray and poetl would be a good return for Ben."
"Spurs get:   * 3rd overall pick  * 2023 1st, top-10 protected  * Kevin Love  Cavaliers get:   * Dejounte Murray  * Derrick White  * 12th overall pick   This is the sort of deal that might entice the Cavs to trade their pick. They get a very good young PG, a solid SG, and a low lotto pick for the crown jewel of the trade (3rd overall), another, protected 1st, and a salary dump (Love). Dejounte pairs well with Darius and White would be a great third guard for them. Plus, they can still get someone promising with the 12th pick. A protected 1st isn't much to dump Love and balance the deal, either.  Spurs do it to get a top tier prospect as well as a veteran who pairs well next to Poeltl. They're guaranteed one of Green/Mobley/Suggs with that pick. Probably either Mobley or Suggs, since top two looks to be Cade and Green. They get a prospect who can be their centerpiece for the future. They also get another first to help them down the line.   Use their cap space wisely on a PG this offseason and some vets for the bench, and they'll still be competitive next season. Something like Dinwiddie or Scroeder /Vassell/Keldon/Love/Poeltl with Patty, (Porter Jr?), Mobley as your first guys off the bench. Maybe they are able to sign two starters, so they also get a SG or SF. Maybe Oladipo or Josh Richardson would come for an overpay."
Dejounte Murray for Grant Williams and a signed Tatum Basketball
Lakers:  Russell Westbrook/Klay Thompson/James Harden/Kawhi Leonard/DeMar DeRozan  Clippers:  Dejounte Murray/Kevin Porter Jr./Zach LaVine/Joe Harris/Jaden McDaniels
"Schroeder is not top ten. Not close.  The list.  Luka, CP3, Fox, Ja, Lowry, Curry, Westbrook, Kyrie, Trae Young, Lillard  The actual list of best PG's in the NBA has dropped off a bit cause Westbrook is gonna fall fast off the list soon, and I think Conley and Kemba are done in terms of being top ten guys, but in there place there could be ascendant guys asap, like Suggs, Cunningham, SGA, Dejounte Murray, FVV, Lonzo or Lamelo Ball, etc.  I'm sure I'm missing someone. Edit: That person is not D'lo."
Dejounte Murray then.  From 2016 to present is the longest tenured Spurs lifer at the moment.
You're trippin. Derrick is a better fit along Ben than Dejounte. If we get Ben we give up Murray. Sorry i like him too but if we were to get Ben that's how it goes
"On the one hand yes, but on the other hand some of the trade suggestions even in this thread are absolutely ridiculous.  Dejounte Murray and Demar Derozan sign and trade? Lol yeah right"

So I did a 2k rebuild and this is how I won a championship.  Did a sign and trade with lauri markkanen for Dejounte Murray.  Signed Drose and Doug McDermott to a 1 year deal.  Bulls made 2nd round and lost in 6   The following free agency sign Lavine and KD and won it all lol
"Kemba, 16th and 18th for Dejounte? I suck at making trades but Murray + SGA seems like a great backcourt to build around and San Antonio having three mid-1sts is spooky"
Pop should get one of his Spurs PG's in there. Demar? Dejounte Murray? Derrick White?
Pop just simply happy he doesn‚Äôt have to make a dejounte Murray/ Derozan/ Gay combo somehow win games
Dejounte Murray. Dudes going to be one of the best young guards next year.
"Murray is not better than DWhite. It‚Äôs not even that close. Also‚Ä¶who are the PGs on the roster? It‚Äôs Dejounte, DWhite, and Tre Jones. And Dejounte and DWhite are both multipositional."
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"this is not true. first of all derrick and dejounte can share the floor, they really complement each other in the best way possible, really, what one do not do, the other do it well. off the bench the bench we have lonnie walker who yes has defensive issues but he played alongside demar and often as a wing which he absolutely is not so he wasn't in a really good situation to defend, plus in general he's not that great. patty mills might leave and go to a contender while he fully go youth movement, win-win situation for both us and him. so we would have tre jones in development who showed really positive flashes, and we could sign a pg just in case too. we do not have five point guards, we are in a right situation in terms of guards, just no need to add more espeically considering how weak our frontcourt is.  i'll also add some other things from a post i did like more than a month ago about our situation, you can read it all if you want [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Let's begin by stating the versatily of the players. DJ is a pure PG, same goes with Tre. Derrick White is gonna start at SG, but he would have zero issues to play the PG  alongside Lonnie who on the other hand could slide at 1 for a small amount of time, but he is definitely a Pure 2 and not a 3 AT ALL, this season showed us this. Keldon is a full-time 3 but he can easily slide at 4 in a small-ball situation. About Devin I would say that he definitely need to play the 3 as his preferred position, he has all the tools to do so, and a solid summer in the gym would define it; he can slide at 2 regardless. DJ-DW Backcourt is really deadly. DJ proved this season that he is arguable the best player on the court without DeMar. And guess who is the other dude that is arguable the best player after DeMar? Derrick White. So yeah, a starting backcourt of this two is obvious and worked amazing when they were both fully healthy. I would play DJ and DW around 30+mins, maybe Derrick a couple of minutes more since he's more versatile. Off the bench Lonnie should definitely be our go-to-guy, our 6-Man. uly him more around 20-25m, limayeb slide him at 1 if necessary. Tre ones is also a really good fit with him, he needs a true PG like him that repares the play for him, they complement each other. The point is that Tre is not that ready, but he has to play, for sure, I would play him around 10-15m, but he can easily see his minutes go up if he keeps doing well! Devin at 3, maybe at 2 if needed, would be really good, a 3&amp;D guy like him is really amazing, I would play around just below 20mins. On defense our true liability is Lonnie, but he would find Tre and Devin, both elite defender, on the perimeter helping him so he can focus on his man and Lonnie showed he can be even above average if he focus on 1v1, imagine with an offseason of work.  also a ""small"" review on their season:  DEJOUNTE MURRAY  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  DERRICK WHITE  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  LONNIE WALKER IV  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him? I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  DEVIN VASSELL  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season"
"Dude has the worst trade suggestion I might have every seen, and that‚Äôs not even me being bias lmao   Mf said Derrick White AND Dejounte Murray for   Marcus Smart, Tristian Thompson,  Aaron Nesmtih and Payton Pritchard. I gotta get off this app lmao"
"So the plan is to intentionally trade 2 of our only good players for worse assets than what they‚Äôre worth? What is the logic in that? The ceiling of white and Murray isn‚Äôt what potentially brings a chip. They are supporting pieces. It‚Äôs the  players you add onto that, and  the players you develop with them that vaults you to that position.   ‚ÄúTank for first pick‚Äù   We can literally tank with those 2 on the roster without taking on worse players. And either way tanking doesn‚Äôt guarantee you get the 1st pick.   ‚ÄúAnd absorb bad contracts to get FR so finally found gems like Manu and Parker from late picks‚Äù   I‚Äôm 100% confused on what you meant by that statement so I‚Äôm just going to assume you meant take on bad contracts to get picks so we can get gems like manu and tony. In that terrible deal you suggested we got Tristan Thompson who has absolutely 0 positive value, Marcus Smart who is expiring and 2 players at rookie deals at positions which we literally do not need. On top of that no picks whatsoever. And the Spurs have already found and developed gems with late picks; those being Derrick White and Dejounte Murray both of whom were 29th picks, and both of whom who aren‚Äôt getting traded for scraps to the Celtics."
Dejounte Murray?
Depends on if it's Jamal Murray or Dejounte Murray
"I disagree with you on the down-bench guys as well, but I don‚Äôt know how you can possibly say a team with Zion, Ingram, Lonzo as their best players, or a team with De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Haliburton or even Barnes has less talent than a team with Demar Derozan? Dejounte Murray? The Spurs have NO top level talent right now."
Counterpoint: Dejounte Murray
"based on what? DeMar and Dejounte Murray are your top two players. Minus some good depth, that's a tank roster for a lot of teams. Watch some teams with lower tier coaches and see how disorganized they are, particularly on defense, how rigid the game plans are with minimal in game adjustments... etc. I think Spurs fans are spoiled in that regard. It's gonna be a real shock if Pop retires and someone mediocre takes over.   A coach also plays a big part in helping a young player realize his full potential, which y'all clearly do well."
No I just mean someone like Lonzo Ball or Dejounte Murray. We just can‚Äôt have Coby White as our starter
"Definitely was gonna pick Curry/Murray UNTIL I saw you meant Dejounte and not Jamal.   In that case, Harden/Russ pretty easily"
"We saw Westbrook Harden duo already, it doesnt really work.   Who the fuck is dejounte murray lol? But id still take Curry + whoever that guy is. Since Curry can probably play with anyone. Westbrook style is declining rapidly with age, and shown it doesnt compliment Harden at all at current stages."
"Well I mean Steph and Jamal would be awesome but westbrook and harden are better, wait a minute DEJOUNTE MURRAY. fuck curry just give me Dejounte Murray. He is confirmed to be the goat."
Seth Curry and Dejounte Murray obviously
Dejounte Murray is a three point shot and a little bit more consistency/veteran savvy away from being a top tier all-pro level player.
"I mean being the 10th seed isn't anything to be excited over, and losing your only all star level player is gonna make you a lot worse than the 10th seed. Your best player is gonna be Dejounte Murray or some shit lol, not much to look forward to"
How about Dejounte Murray?
"No, I said team friendly. When Dejounte Murray is getting 4 Years 64 million, 72M for OG is a great deal for the Raptors. Derrick White got 4 Years 70M, Joe Harris for 4 years 72M, then OG for 4 years 72M is below market value and a team friendly deal.  A player doesn't have to be top 30 to not want them to be traded outside of for a star or for a franchise to value them."
"4 Years 72 Million isn't team friendly for a player of OGs caliber to you? When Dejounte Murray is getting 4 Years 64 million, 72M for OG is a great deal for the Raptors. Derrick White got 4 Years 70M, Joe Harris for 4 years 72M. None of them offer equivalent value on the court that OG brings or as an asset so yeah, OG getting locked in at his current extension is team friendly."
"Bro. Derozen is about to get a solid contract because he‚Äôs a positive and everyone shits on him but they know... Deep down inside... That not only does he have the most efficient iso game in the league he has the best footwork in the league. He‚Äôs constantly been a positive, even on mediocre teams like this years spurs. Also, Dejounte Murray isn‚Äôt a bucket getter but the man is a defensive beast that can pass, thats who you build around."
"They have 3 actual contracts left on the team at this point.   Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Jakob Poeltl.   What free agents are looking at that and going ""Yeah this is where we want to spend the next portion of our careers""?  Not to mention Pop is going to be 73 heading into next season.   The only free agent they've ever really gotten was Aldridge, and he went when they had Kawhi, Duncan, the rest of their amazing supporting cast, and fresh off of a 55 win seasons (two seasons removed from a championship).   You can have an infinite amount of cap space but if you're not primed to win then it's not going to get you anywhere."
Dejounte murray
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that‚Äôs also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
"Rudy Gay missed 25 games that year, only started 6, and was 6th on the team in MPG (0.1 ahead of Dejounte Murray).   He was a role player. Not the second best lmao."
"I‚Äôm a Spurs fan and i would give you Dejounte Murray, this year‚Äôs 12th pick, and Lonnie Walker."
Dejounte Murray or Derrick White
"Lonnie walker and DeJounte Murray have both taken heavily after DeMar, for better and for worse. they both improved with footwork, mid range shooting, finishing, and passing. defensively, moreso with Lonnie, he's not good at all. that said, they've both clearly become much more polished and skilled offensive players and I think DD is a big part of that."
"I agree Jackson is arguably the better coach, but the way this worded makes Pop seem carried by Duncan and blames him for Kawhi which is 100% not true. Duncan as good as he was wasn't the reason Tony Parker, Ginobili, Kawhi all developed into good players. This also doesn't take into account the insane amount of player Pop brought the best out of players like Patty Mills, Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, George Hill, Danny Green, Dejuan Blair, and the list goes on. The guy is a minimum Top 5 coach all time minimum and I would go even as far as to say he's probably higher than that. I think the idea that he's overrated is just simply not true."
Here I‚Äôll do it with out including a player being paid more than 20 mil AAV besides Ben and no rookies sound fair?   PG: Dejounte Murray - 16 Mil AAV  SG: Norman Powell - 10.4 AAV  SF: TJ Warren - 11.7 AAV  PF: Christian Wood - 13.6 AAV  C: Ben Simmons  6th Man: Jordan Clarkson - 12.8 AAV  Backup Center for Point Simmons: Serge Ibaka - 9.4 AAV
"Besides the obvious choices here, Dejounte Murray and San Antonio"
Dejounte Murray is Canadian? I thought he was born in Seattle?
"Man I love me some Dejounte Murray, excellent defender, coming into his own as a scorer, I think he can definitely win Most Improved Player next year"
Dejounte Murray for 15 million is pretty good
...So you say it's cause you want a true PG.  Then you list a Dejounte Murray trade and a trade with Toronto that would never happen.    So basically there aren't any realistic trades for you.
"That's true, I think he is worth significantly more than a minimum and that sounds about right. Looking at contracts it does get a little harder justifying paying a premium for such niche situations when at that price you can get quality role players like Marcus Smart, Danny Green, Dejounte Murray, Christian Wood. Granted some of those players are team friendly contracts but still."
"Lol okay buddy, Pop's retiring soon enough, Kawhi already told y'all you ain't shit, and no free agent is coming to San Antonio. Can't wait to see a Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson core hoist up the Larry O'Brien. ü§£"
Sorry I forget about Dejounte. Jamal Murray is who I meant.
"I think the Orlando job is the gig for Hammon honestly. Absolutely 0 pressure in that position because they're bottom-5 talentwise, so you're going to get a longer leash and a more substantial sample size. But they also have some interesting young point guards that could benefit immensely from working under Hammon. Because that's her specialty, point guard development. Dejounte Murray has pointed at Hammon in the past as one of the big contributors to his development of his footwork and ball placement on passes and stuff like that."
They got dejounte Murray I'm pretty sure
"Jamal and Dejounte Murray!  Then like Darius Bazley, Terrance Davis, Taurean Prince, and WCS. Qickley, Maxey, and Patrick Williams as rookies.  So... you can go real young + Kawhi, or very Murray + Kawhi."
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it‚Äôs not the league‚Äôs fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here‚Äôs a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there‚Äôs a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
"Spurs got some really likeable guys like Keldon Johnson and some really entertaining players like Derrick White, DeRozan, and Dejounte Murray. End of the boring era?"
"Interesting, are we counting Harden and LeBron as PGs? I won‚Äôt count them just to see  In no order:  Steph, Kyrie, Dame, CP3, Luka, Lowry, Young, Westbrook,  Ja, Fox, Murray, LaMelo, Conley, Lonzo are all better than him   So MAYBE yeah that 15-20 range is fine.  I still didn‚Äôt even list: Kemba, Simmons, Shroeder, DEjounte, Brogdon, Rose, Sexton and Russell"
The best thing I can come up with off the top of my head is a Simmons for Dejounte Murray swap. It benefits both parties right now and generates a pretty big trade exception for Philly.  The Spurs fans brigading me right now are just being homers
In what world is Dejounte untouchable if Ben Simmons is on the table? Ben was a top-20 guy this season and Dejounte wasn‚Äôt even top-50. They‚Äôre the same age and Ben has been healthy since his second rookie season.   If Morey calls me and offers Ben for Dejounte 1:1 (or even if they offer a pick) I‚Äôm packing Murray‚Äôs bags. And I like Murray.
"Murray averaged more points, same rebounds and steals, an assist and a half less with better ast/tov ratio while playing all nba caliber defense, but granted not as amazing as Ben. As well as being a 1000% better shooter than ben even if he is below average shooter just by the virtue of taking shots and has become a great finisher at the rim. That is all regular season and Ben for sure is a better defender and better playmaker but he became an active detriment to his team who couldn‚Äôt end games. Dejounte could provide 70-80% of Simmons‚Äô benefits while being way less of a liability and wouldn‚Äôt be scared of the moment or to dunk a fucking ball on Trae Young."
"Dejounte Murray for Ben Simmons makes a lot of sense for the 76ers, but I think he's the ONE player I wouldn't trade if I'm the Spurs."
"Their 2 highest paid players next year will be Dejounte Murray and Derrick White at $15M and the Spurs would not want to trade them. If you combine everyone else left on the roster next year, it does not even reach $30M so they don't have enough salary filler to throw into the trade.   The only possible way is if another team does a sign and trade for DeRozan so that they can create a trade exception and get Ben Simmons that way, but that would mean some team is willing to sign him for $33M next year which I don't see happening."
"Who do they even have on their roster at this point?   DM;DR is on the wrong side of 30 and still hasn't developed a 3pt shot himself, nor does he play much defense.   He does have a great mid-range game, so that would be a bit better than what Ben offers offensively, but the Sixers are likely better off with Seth Curry than DM;DR.   Philly would need a point guard in a Simmons trade. I mean.... I supposed DM;DR could play point. That was essentially his role with the Spurs (he did lead them in assists). He could share the backcourt with Seth?   Dejounte Murray is the better defender.  I'm not sure what Pop would even do with Simmons, other than maybe just put him at power forward, which is where he should be."
"&gt;Spurs...would have to include a Derozan SnT  I don't think so, I think the Spurs could put together a package centered in their young guys that would be pretty compelling. Dejounte Murray does a lot of what Simmons does (obviously not as well but still pretty well), but is a lot cheaper and has some semblance of a half court offense for example, then there's wings like Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, or Devin Vassell who would all fit with Embiid really well. Plus the Spurs have the cap space to make salary matching pretty easy.  The only question is if the Spurs are willing to make the trade, they're obviously historically very stingy."
Well I'm not sure what they want but sure they can have Derrick white or Dejounte Murray according to Bowen Pop won't mind trading them.  But if they won't a scoring guard who's also a great passer I would still take proven all star Demar
The spurs have no one/money to trade. Half their roster is FA with the end of the season. No pieces to really entice the sixers. Derrick white or dejounte Murray? Better be ready to throw in a ton of picks.
Why is everybody saying this is a DeRozan deal? If you‚Äôre the Sixers and can have anybody off that roster you‚Äôre picking one year of DeRozan?   I‚Äôll take Dejounte Murray thanks
We have Dejounte Murray and a Derrick white backcourt. Already two defensive prowess guards that aren‚Äôt the best offensively. The last thing we need is to trade our best scorer for a slightly better Dejounte Murray that takes up 30% of our cap space.
I‚Äôm not trading dejounte Murray for Simmons. I‚Äôm also not in a position of power in a basketball organization
"Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, made Derozan highly efficient as playmaker, plucked Neal, Forbes, Bertans from undrafted or late 2nd round, Tony Parker developed a semi-reliable 3pt shot, Manu was Manu, made Bowen into a reliable corner 3 shooter (but didnt fix FTs), worked with TD to improve FT form to mixed results.   They are known to not just concentrate on shooting but rather optimize the game from ground up. Thats why we are just starting to see Dejounte Murray improve the three as he needed handling, passing and rehab first. Hes improved his midrange extensively. Other players have improved shooting form (Murray, White, KJ (wip), Walker (more consistent), Luka (was doing great at Austin), Vassel saw slight improvement before falling back.   So there is progress from a lot of players but not all can be attributed to the coaching staff, great majority is player dependent on their effort and hard work, Spurs just provide good coaching to achieve the results.   Simmons seems to be a prime player for Pop and staff to figure out his best role and attack his weaknesses to put him in the best situation to succeed. We reclaimed Boris Diaw and at times he was the best player on both ends for Spurs. Simmons would be a beast in SA, dont care what everyone says about him."
DeJounte Murray
The Spurs would never trade dejounte Murray for Ben Simmons
"There's some very good pieces on the Spurs, I'd get excited for Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, or Derrick White. Even a Demar sign/trade could be intriguing."
Dejounte Murray &gt; Ben Simmons
Ah yes with superstars Demar Derozan and Dejounte Murray who‚Äôs been injured til this season
"Which is why she would be perfect if she took over for the Spurs. She won G-League title coaching some of these guys, including DeJounte Murray. The young core have had her as an assistant and respect her. She‚Äôd also be coming off of the GOAT coach for a young team, so expectations would not be too high. Plus the city loves her. She would be set for like 2 years at least."
PG- Dejounte Murray  SG-Kobe Sf- Giannis Pf- Chris Webber C- Amar'e Stoudemire
My first thought was San Antonio and Dejounte Murray maybe... but fuck the Spurs I guess lol
"Just peeked at the Spurs roster - remembering they lost DeRozan (their leading scorer), Patty Mills &amp; Rudy Gay (arguably their two best guys off the bench) - and it's looking a little dire. Dejounte Murray &amp; Doug McDermott are probably their top two scorers this season - maybe Derrick White too? Spurs were last in 3pt shots made &amp; attempted per game &amp; 24th in 3pt%. ""McBuckets"" will help with that, but I think at this point the Spurs might be best just to Choke for Chet (Holmgren).  Orlando seems to have a slew of players who aren't really starter material yet but someone's gonna have to do it. Where's their offense coming from, guys who can't stay healthy?"
"this sub has become a parody of itself. Every Simmons trade thread is now ""I wouldn't trade Dejounte Murray/Wiggins for Simmons straight up, let alone with picks""."
"You seriously think in 2-4 years Malcolm Brogdon, DeJounte Murray, and Caris LeVert could be considered better than Ben Simmons? This is ridiculous, sorry.  People are criticizing Ben Simmons bc he can't be the second best guy on a finals team. A Sabonis, Brogdon, and LeVert core couldn't even make the playoffs."
"He is top 5 right now, but that status is getting more precarious by the second.    You could make a strong argument that Brown, Ingram, Sabonis, and Siakam are all better than him right now, and the book isn‚Äôt closed on guys like Brogdon, Murray (both Jamal and Dejounte), and LeVert.    Simmons was by far the most NBA ready player in that class, and he‚Äôs still got the elite playmaking, slashing, and defense that he was drafted for, but it‚Äôs very easy to make the case that he‚Äôs still basically the same player that he was in year 1 while all of the other guys have been steadily improving.  I would not be surprised if Ben Simmons was not seen as a top 5 player in his class in 2-4 years."
"Dejounte Murray is easily San Antonio's best, easily.  and the Magic I'd say is Wendell Carter Jr. I really have to see Fultz continue to stay healthy, same thing with Isaac. and there's no way it's already Suggs he hasn't played a regular season game yet"
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"
"Spurs: Idk, probably Dejounte Murray  Magic: Jonathan Isaac when he‚Äôs healthy. Other than that, I think it‚Äôs Wendell Carter Junior."
"DeJounte Murray for the Spurs, the Magic are a tossup tbh"
Probably Derrick White or Dejounte Murray for the Spurs and either Suggs or Isaac for Orlando
"On the contrary, I‚Äôd love to see the shocked members of r/nba when he goes for more than a package like Dejounte Murray + Lonnie Walker"
"Any superstar would be a great fit next to him. So I‚Äôm going to try to pick a player who isn‚Äôt a superstar.   Middleton isn‚Äôt a superstar who I think would be amazing with Jordan. It gives him a big wing who can do it all, we already saw what that does for him when he got Pippen. Having a lineup with those 2 as the best players would probably make them a favorites to win it all.   PG : Dejounte Murray  SG : Jordan  SF : Middleton   PF : Crowder  C : Capela   I feel like a GM would be able to make this roster happen with the salaries. And those guys as the main guys would be a great starting 5"
"&gt;I think you just have absolutely no idea what you‚Äôre talking about and think that Lonnie fucking Walker helps the 76ers lol.  The centerpiece of this trade is Dejounte Murray, at some point maybe you should address Murry vs Simmons like I did in my original comment?  Lonnie is icing on the cake to balance the scales."
"I think they are. Remember that Ben is making 30M per year, Murray is making around 14M while Lonnie is on a rookie contract. If they didn‚Äôt need to add significant pieces to match salaries, is Ben Simmons really double the value of Dejounte Murray?"
"Dejounte Murray was first team all-D at a younger age, and can actually shoot.  There would have to be slightly more, but Simmons is on a near max contract and is a very weak all star."
"I would take deaaron fox over dejounte Murray, hield over white, Holmes over poeltl, Barnes over....walker? I don't even know who the spurs 3rd/4th/5th best players are. Kings are sneakily deeper than you would think and while I think pop would embarrass Walton when it comes to coaching, the way you win games is with players."
"Not enough fighting, so... Power Rankings:    1. New Orleans Pelicans - Luka Doncic LeBron James    2. Portland Trail Blazers - Kawhi Leonard Stephen Curry    3.

The two best players are clearly Derrick White and Dejounte Murray. No clue why he used Jakob Poeltl.
"&gt; He played 38 mins a game that playoffs.  It was a wrist injury lol. That doesn't affect your cardio or ability to move.  &gt; You keep mentioning how Wall was better than Lowry  Of course he was. Because of the injury.  &gt; Oh no let‚Äôs do like you though and minimize it to just ‚Äú1 ppg and 3 apg‚Äù as if any real objective basketball fan would use an argument so basic. Hey Our New PG Dennis Schr√∂der only averaged 2 ppg and 3 apg less than Lowry last season guess there isn‚Äôt a huge jump in how good they are compared to each other lol.  You're the one minimizing it to just two stats. Lowry beats him by every advanced metric and was a significantly better defender. You're completely right that Lowry scoring just 2ppg and 3apg more than Schroeder doesn't show the whole picture, you have to look at *all* of the stats. Was Colin Sexton better than Chris Paul because he averaged more ppg this year? Oh and Jonas Valanciunas is better than Rudy Gobert. And don't forget that Jordan Clarkson is way better than Dejounte Murray.   Or do we need to look at more than just minimal differences in base box stats to evaluate a player?  Honestly at this point I'm not exactly sure if you understand how efficiency works. 1ppg is, quite literally, meaningless without looking at efficiency. But if that's your reason for Wall being better then you do you.  &gt; Wall was better in the regular season  So... Lowry leads him in every advanced stat and had Curry level efficiency and was one of the best floor spacers in the league... but Wall got 1 more ppg so he was way better lmao. Got it.  &gt; Would love to hear what you think Lowry could‚Äôve been if he hadn‚Äôt been ‚Äúhurt‚Äù throughout his prime though. Maybe a couple of 1st team all nbas? An MVP? Scoring titles? Surely in contention for goat right?  Lol come on now. Let's just have a mature debate about this without strawmanning. Personally I think Lowry had an argument for one more all nba third team in 2016 though, but it's debatable."
Dejounte Murray and Derrick White!
"Dejounte Murray has to be ours now that Patty has moved on. Sucks, I really like watching the same guys over the years. I'm sure Laker fans feel differently about LeBron than they do Kobe, for example....I don't want players feeling stuck in bad situations but I like it when they feel like they can compete and build a home in one spot like we had for so many years."
I see a lot of Superstars/All time greats in the comments so i‚Äôll add a role player: Dejounte Murray
"I don't think it's close at all. I'd much rather have Fox or Murray. Add in salary considerations and I'd probably rather have dejounte, dinwiddie, schroeder, ja, and MAYBE kemba. At russ's best he is better than a lot of these guys during the season, but I'm skeptical of how often he can actually play at that level and if his best is conducive to winning playoff basketball."
"Lonnie Walker is a player that has very high potential but, unfortunately, is being held down by Pop's rotation. Not to mention, the Spurs has a lot of young players that has high potential. Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray seems to be the future of the Spurs. But Lonnie can be a star on his own.. just not on this team."
"Dejounte Murray &gt; Ben Simmons  Everyone thinking the Spurs should give up Murray + other players + picks + pick swaps for Simmons are insane. Simmons is a better defender, though Murray is good, and Murray is already a better offensive player and is actually committed to getting better."
Dejounte Murray but I spit that ish all the time
Dejounte Murray
"This is probably my #1, along with Kevin Porter Jr., Rui Hachimura, Dejounte Murray, and my homeboys, Bey and Stewart."
"Dejounte Murray, if he can get his 3 shot to 36-37%, he will be amazing"
Dejounte Murray can be so great.
"Yeah I mean the nature of these threads is despite what we will say the odds of any of these guys becoming actual stars nonetheless superstars are quite low. So your just looking for what possible path is there to reaching such a level and is it completely implausible. I would say probably so for being like a top 12ish player for DeJounte Murray but if I had to nominate someone for this he's a better candidate than a number of names Ive seen here like Cam Reddish or whatever. And by ""better"" candidate its like a 3% chance vs 1% or whatever.   Someone else nominated Devin Vassell on here which if you made San Antonio pick which guy would you keep the next 5-10 yrs Vassell or DeJounte that's an interesting question. I bet they might say Vassell"
"Dejounte Murray, Brandon Clarke"
dejounte murray
I‚Äôm not sold on Bagley and Dejounte Murray being better than RJ

Dejounte Murray
"Dejounte Murray, 15 a game along with elite defense but it never brought up."
Dejounte Murray
"I'll say it...I'm extremely disappointed with the Primo pick. I really wanted Sengun who is already looking like a stud.  The Spurs already have five young G/Fs in the pipeline with Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, and Tre Jones. We also brought back Bryn Forbes for some dumbass reason.  There is absolutely no reason why we should've used the #12 pick on a 18-year old guard who will probably need two years in GLeague to be NBA ready. He was projected to go late first or early second round. He would've been a great pick at 25...but 12!?  I can only trust that Pop and the front office sees something I don't...obviously they've found diamonds in the rough before. But we left a lot of talent on the board to reach for a player who doesn't really fit right now."
"Definitely.   I must say however that dejounte murray has a similar build, and murray's rebounding and defensive stats are way better, so it comes to effort and fundamentals."
"Ezeli Was drafted in 2012. The peak of Mccaw and Bell was about 10 good games in their rookie seasons, both of them regresssed their second season and are out of the league now.   The Spurs drafted Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Keldon Johnson, all high-level starters picking at end of the first round like the Warriors."

"I doubt it. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and maybe Keldon will all probably score more points per game than him. Lonnie probably won't even start for the spurs"
If anyone on the Spurs will have a breakout season its Dejounte Murray and Primo Pasta.
Caris LeVert. Dejounte Murray. Alperen Sengun. Keon Johnson. Kevin Porter Jr.
Dejounte Murray and KPJ both dropped 40 in this tourney   Couple NBA players played in it. Jamal Crawford too
So basically I should mortgage my house on Dejounte Murray MVP odds?
&gt; In fact you guys have to package additional assets with Simmons if you want dejounte.  This is the insane level of delusion I am talking about.  Murray had the 3rd lowest TS% among NBA starters last year.  That is the definition of inefficient.  I cannot believe how overrated he is on this board
Ofcourse he is not untouchable. But to act like you are doing us a favour by taking Murray plus our upcoming future assets is bull crap. Nor is it a fair trade. In fact you guys have to package additional assets with Simmons if you want dejounte.  He was not known to be a lead ball handler when he was drafted but he was our 1B option after demar derozan and he did a fine job. That tells a lot about his development. And that's after losing a year to acl and another recovering from it.  He was I think around 7th or 8th overall in midrange FG % last season and that's not how you even begin to describe inefficiency.  So please.
You know this sub is in a bad state when statements that Dejounte Murray and Andrew Wiggins are untouchable in a Simmons trade are being upvoted.  It‚Äôs impossible to engage in an honest dialogue around Simmons with the current mob mentality around here.
It's r/nba . Only the last 3 games matter and completely define his career. Dejounte Murray and Andrew Wiggins are better than him now. Get with the program.
"There‚Äôs not liking Simmons, and then there is believing Dejounte Murray is better.  Dude is Fultz level inefficient over his career.  Simmons is a flawed player but he has still played a hand in regular season success, Murray has accomplished nothing at the same age.  But at the state of this sub the Simmons circlejerk is what gets upvotes so people can‚Äôt engage in a good faith conversation about his value."
Crazy that Spurs fans would rather have Dejounte Murray than Ben Simmons
In what world is Dejounte Murray untouchable for Simmons?  He‚Äôs statistically one of the most inefficient guards in the game right now
"Not sure who I'd even want from the Spurs. Dejounte Murray is a worse/shorter PG version of Simmons.  From the Timberwolves, not sure if D'Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley move the needle for their cost. I don't think Russell is a 16 game player."
Dejounte Murray deleted tweet?
"Dejounte Murray also called him out.  Kawhi did our team dirty, but he's far from a bad person and he deserves respect on and off the court."
[Dejounte Murray replied too.](https://twitter.com/DejounteMurray/status/1425190627474612224?s=20)
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
I'm simping for Dejounte Murray
"Yeah, and the Spurs who played more than 10 minutes in that game were LaMarcus Aldridge, Jonathon Simmons, Danny Green, Pau Gasol, Patty Mills, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, and Manu Ginobili. Ginobili was 39, Gasol was 37, and Murray was 20. That may be slightly better than what Houston had, but not by enough that they should have lost by almost 40 points."
"No it‚Äôs not a foul. Some stars get that call though if they exaggerate the contact enough and at least get a half step on them. Davion was in front of him the whole time.  Also multiple guards like Jrue, Marcus Smart, Dejounte Murray, etc. guard up like this. Not every possession but you‚Äôll definitely see it every game they play."
IT Zach Lavine Dejounte Murray Jamal Crawford KPJ  all guards but oh well lol
"Seattle will have the True Hoopers Elite team. IT, Jordan Crawford, Nate Robinson, Zach LaVine, and Dejounte Murray. I‚Äôm sure that there‚Äôs an actual starting 5 with people over 6‚Äô6  you could put together but those are the guys I have off the top of my head and I don‚Äôt feel like doing more research."
Kawhi  PG13  Dame  Donavon Mitchell  Russ  Ja Morant  Kyrie  Derozan  Bradley Beal  Dejounte Murray  Keldon Johnson   Giannis  Patty Mills  Blake Griffin   Reggie Jackson  Oladipo  Sabonis  Bojan Bogdonavich  Mike Conley   Jimmy Butler  Rudy Gay
"&gt; High flying play-maker with good defense awareness  So Dejounte Murray?   It is just that I look at the Spurs roster and sort by height and it basically looks like they are been forced into drafting 6'4""/6'5"" guards. Murray, White, Primo, Vassell, Walker and Johnson all different type players yet all between one inch of each other. Is Johnson ready enough to guard all the big/good SFs? At PF whos the matchup with Giannis, Sabonis, Zion, Jokic, etc? Spurs are too damn small lol"
"Quoting the gentleman and a scholar Dejounte Murray ""FUCK NO!!!!!!! Have A Great Day!!"""
"For his position? Nah. Above average starter means he's in the top 15 PGs in the league.   I have, in no particular order, Steph, CP3, Westbrook, Trae, Luka, Jrue, Dejounte Murray, Jamal Murray, Lowry, Lillard, Kyrie, Simmons, Conley, Fox, Ja, Brogdon, SGA all above him. Might have some I missed too.  Better than Graham though"
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good.

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray and to ask where that Pop slander went
"Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson. I'm not giving up any picks, Spurs have too much history making those work."
KD &gt; CP3 &gt; Kawhi &gt; DeRozan and my underrated contender is DeJounte Murray. His elbow jumper is money.
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
**G:** DeJounte Murray   **G:** Trae Young   **F:** LaMelo Ball  **F:** Zach LaVine   **C:** Malcolm Brogdon   **Bench:** TJ McConnell / Jalen Brunson / DAngelo Russell / Jamal Murray / Cam Payne
You know you're team's future is bleak when Dejounte Murray is your future star.
"I'd say JB &gt; BI in a revisionist history sense. Ben's still above everyone in his draft class except for those two and maybe Murray and Siakam but is probably a solid 3rd. Sabonis, Caris, Dejounte, and Brogdon are next. Only like 12 guys still in the league from this class."
"I know a lot of Spurs fan dont want him but todays team is gearing to be a much better match for Simmon's game type than last years.   We have a ton of shooters to surround him and could send Dejounte Murray, Thad Young, Lonnie Walker and a protected pick.  Dont know if that beats other offers but does give PHI a young PG, a starter level PF and a bench scorer plus a pick.   Simmon's market is not great right now and 3 starter level players for simmons is not a bad return with how horrible that situation is right now."
"""San Antonio is sending Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and the 2022+2024 1st round picks to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons"""
I‚Äôm super high on Myles Bridges and Dejounte Murray  I‚Äôm pretty low on Jamal Murray
"I‚Äôm always annoyed Spurs don‚Äôt get talked about enough in the media, until I actually hear/read when they ARE talked about, and then realize it‚Äôs just because they don‚Äôt watch our games or have a clue.  It‚Äôs obvious. We‚Äôre going youth movement and seeing what happens with Derrick White, DeJounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson leading the team. We either sink (likely) and get a lottery pick, or we swim because at least one of them broke out and made the leap. The other signings are valuable assets that we can trade away when teams want them. Simple.  Also just a terrible take on DeJounte Murray. Other people have said it already but his midrange game is elite and he can create for others. He‚Äôs a good offensive presence, even if he doesn‚Äôt shoot 3‚Äôs."
"The spurs roster if full of guys who will at worst be decent role players. If one of Derrick, Dejounte, or Keldon makes a significant improvement this season and we stay healthy, we'll be about as good as we were last year imo. We just drafted an 18 year old that had a good chance of being a sure lottery pick next year.  If we decide this roster won't get it done, we can easily trade Derrick White and possibly Dejounte Murray for good future assets and build around Primo, Vassell, and Keldon who are 18, 20, and 21."
"MiP: Dejounte Murray, I‚Äôm biased obviously but I think he‚Äôll average 20/8/8 this year and the spurs will be a 7-10th seed again   Most regressed player: I‚Äôm guessing PJ Tucker"
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
Dejounte Murray
There should be a game show where you show an audience Instagram captions and they have to guess whether it came from LeBron James or Dejounte Murray.
so the lakers can continue to add players while they already have 3 max salaries but the spurs with no max salaries have to waive 2 guys in order to add chandler hutchinson.  hell the highest salary on SA's books is dejounte murray at 15m  yea this CBA makes sense
TIL dejounte murray is an object
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
"Primo hasn‚Äôt played a second in the NBA, let‚Äôs give him some time to prove he is a bust/stud. And no I don‚Äôt like the FA the Spurs have signed but, at least now we can go back to Spurs basketball, no more of this iso hero ball bullshit. They will win or lose as a team. Plus, Dejounte Murray can finally be our go to option and breakout into his first All-Star season. I‚Äôm not worried, we barely missed the playoffs last year, probably gonna barely miss them again. So no, I think this roster has nothing but potential, even if it is a little messy right now."
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
"You never know whats gonna happen, and plus I think they dont really need a Luka or Trae . Considering their other young players like Keldon Jackson or Dejounte Murray can be good role players they need a Booker/Mitchell/Lavine level player which is way more realistic than finding a Luka"
"Yeah if Kawhi didn't screw the spurs over, all anyone would be talking about is how the spurs are still good and drafted Derrick White and Dejounte Murray with the 29th picks when they should've gone in the lottery."
Depending on what they gave up I agree with you. I still think of the rumored teams the Spurs and the trailblazers are better fits. In Portland he wouldn't have to really change his game much he could just survive off of gritty second chance fast break scoring and bust his butt to protect Damien on defense and allow him to play off the ball more.   With the Spurs he could slide right into the lead guard role since one of the players that would be shipped out for him is actually a very similar style guard in dejounte Murray. That Spurs team has a lot of pace and athleticism but nobody with the ball handling skills to really unlock it. Plus all of a sudden they signed a ton of shooters to spread the floor and allow Simmons to pretty much run a pace and space offense completely built around his ability to get the rebound and push the ball.   I do like the idea of him on Minnesota though. I've always had a soft spot for them and feel bad for that fan base having to go through such hell with ownership problems and shortsighted decisions. If they could get him on the team without having to give up too much more than Russell draft picks and player filler I could definitely see them fighting for a bottom playoff spot pretty immediately.
I mean he had shooters- but Embiid is a center - so he tends to be down low more.  I am just saying I could see him fulfilling the Draymond type role well.       And I don't think Dejounte Murray and Simmons are close to the same level.
"I don't see the value in the Spurs getting Simmons, when they have Dejounte Murray, a similar position player at less than half the salary for 3 more years, and they cannot play together. Murray has show constant improvement each year, and now has just as much chance to develop into a 2nd/3rd option as Simmons, and doesn't have the salary risk.  White, Young, and 2 protected first wouldn't be enough anyways.  You do realize he had some of the best spacing in the league in philly and couldn't get it done. This narrative that he needs more shooters is ridiculous.  Imagine having Harris, Embiid and Curry, for spacing (all aelite for their position) vs Jakob, keldon, vassel, Murray in San Antonio (all below average). Which situation sounds better for Ben?"
I think it will be for a Dejounte Murray package
Sexton is probably better than Dejounte Murray and picks. I doubt the Spurs would trade Keldon since he seems to be Pop‚Äôs favorite. I don‚Äôt think the T wolves have a good offer unless they put DLo in the trade.   But what if the Raptors offered Fred Van Vleet or Siakam? I‚Äôd probably still take Sexton but those two raptors are interesting names.
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
"PG: Jrue Holiday (All Star)  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovich  SF: Paul George (All Star)  PF: Kawhi Leonard (Superstar)  C: Jokic (Superstar)  Bench Dejounte Murray, G  Jalen Brunson, G  Mikal Bridges, F  Matisse Thybulle, F  Joe Ingles, F  Draymond Green, F/C  Clint Capela, C"
"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."
Dejounte Murray or Derrick White
Wow. So he‚Äôs better than Dejounte Murray?
"Dejounte Murray for Tim Duncan? Yeah, I think I'd do that."
Dejounte Murray‚Ä¶..
Yes. Dejounte Murray for Tim Duncan.
"did they really, when they could have not given him that contract and then tried to use that cap space then to find better help for Beal? of course they didn't expect him to tear his shit up at fuckin home lol   also as bad as the Rockets were last year, I still feel like John Wall has great vision and will be very important to the development of KPJ and Jalen Green. both of those guys are lead guards who are primarily bucket getters. he'll both elevate their shots with his transition passing and I think at this stage of his career he's open to being a good vet for them.   despite what people think of, say DeRozan, he's been really huge for the development of a guy like DeJounte Murray, who went from a zero offense defense first guard to one of the five most efficient mid range iso scorers in the league last year. largely using moves I can clearly see he developed with DeMar. same goes for his passing, because he never looked much good at that before last season either. I think John Wall might be more beneficial to keep around while they're bad than some realize."
"Dejounte Murray, always like drafting him in fantasy basketball."
"Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Malcolm Brogdon and Grayson Allen"
"Derrick is probably a better all around player than Dejounte and in the 2019 playoffs, outplayed Jamal Murray. Injuries and COVID derailed his last season, but he's every solid player....when healthy."
"Gonna have to go with Luka, Russel Westbrook, Ben Simmons in the craziest season turnaround weve ever seen, or Dejounte Murray."
"I think the raw numbers would say it's Dejounte Murray but I think it's one of the cases where someone else is more impactful. Murray's more talented an has more room to grow but Derrick's ability to run the offense, better 3 point shooting and IMO much better team defense makes him more impactful on both ends of the floor than DJ."
"Can't really see where he'd fit...most teams already have a point guard that is better than him or getting paid a lot less.  Only teams that could use an upgrade at the PG spot are the Celtics, Pelicans, Spurs, and Magic. As a Celtics fan I would not want him on that contract, unless he got a buyout. Spurs should probably be giving playing time to Dejounte Murray. Magic should be giving more playing time to their younger guys.   Pelicans could be an ok fit, Wall is definitely an upgrade over Satoransky or whoever they have starting for them at the point guard spot."
"Chris Paul  Smart/Schroder  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons   Kyle Lowry  Harden (or Kyrie)  Lonzo  Conley  Dejounte Murray  Devonte' Graham  Jamal Murray  Patrick Beverley  Brogdon  Rubio  Terry Rozier (or LaMelo)  Lillard  Westbrook  Luka  Sexton  who here is Curry objectively a better defender than?  because if he's not better than at least 4 or 5 of them, he is below average.  that is how average works lol"

"For sure. But I think there's a possibility they make a different trade and flip the guys they got for better assets. The rockets basically traded Harden for 4 firsts and 3 swaps, at least one of which is likely meaningless. The sixers were offering Simmons, probably 2 firsts, and Thybulle. Other teams like the spurs and wolves have expressed interest in acquiring Simmons, just not at the ridiculous price that Morey has been wanting.  The rockets probably could've kept Thybulle and traded Simmons to a team that wants him for a reasonable price. Something like Beasley and a few firsts, Brogdon and a first, or Dejounte Murray, Thad Young, and a first. And if they really want to bottom out, they could've traded those players too for a bad contract and picks.  I don't think their trade was terrible but if the nets never become worse than an okay lottery team, it'll be looked back on pretty poorly."

LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"Dejounte Murray is a mid range shooting finesse player, RJ is a straight line slasher who can play well off ball with his 3pt shooting and cutting. I don‚Äôt really see the comp between the 2"
I feel like he could become more like a better Dejounte Murray
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"Keep sleeping üò¥ doubt he ever makes an allstar team, but with his skillset assuming he stays healthy I think he can be a high level starting combo guard and I love the fit with him next to Suggs despite neither projecting to be true point guards.   Aside from the whole unable to make 3s and weird free throw stuff (that he‚Äôs actually gotten better at) Markelle fultz has a lot of talent especially on offense. When watching him his athleticism, pace he plays at, ability to change speeds, ball handling/control, ability to get to rim, ability to finish at the rim at a very high level, pull up game, in-between game and passing IQ make his offensive game more complete than people seem to think. His few main downsides on that end are his FTr, FT%, 3 pointer (which will all skew his TS% for his career assuming they all stay stagnant) and he also needs to become a better PnR player.   Outside of that I‚Äôm not sure what else to say. I‚Äôm not too worried about the torn ACL I‚Äôve seen young athletic guards like Zach Lavine and Dejounte Murray tear it and come back not only the same player but better and I think the same will happen with Markelle. I don‚Äôt expect him to play amazing this upcoming season just due to the fact that he is coming off an injury but once he‚Äôs 100% in 2022-2023 I think he‚Äôll see the emergence of Markelle Fultz."
"Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, both bogdanovich‚Äôs"
And dejounte is quicker. Don't know which Murray is he talking about
Like Jamal Murray or dejounte Murray? Jamal is so quick so idk
You know who would be really good and wouldn‚Äôt count as enough of a star to reduce the assets attached? Dejounte Murray. Him + Thaddeus Young for Ben is a good trade
"The Spurs are really good. Look outside of Kawhi or their stars. They turned an undrafted Bryn Forbes into a borderline rotation guy. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray were back to back 29th picks who became good rotation players. Going back even further, they basically resurrected Danny Green's career and made Patty Mills the guy he is today. Kawhi is the pinnacle of their development but they've done great work with a lot of players"
"Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker and the picks we got from Chicago.   Tough to part with the guys, but I'd be willing to risk it for a talent like Ben, and we have enough young talent to take their spots."
"If the Spurs beat the Pelicans more than once this year I‚Äôll be shocked, the best player on your team is who, Dejounte Murray? Keldon Johnson?"
"Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, and two top 5 protected firsts probably spread out a bit. Like 2023, 2025."
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
"Dejounte Murray Derrick White, Thadeus Young and maybe a pick or 2."
"&gt;1.	‚Å†KD has declined.   He just had a year as good or arguably better than the ones he had in Golden State.    &gt;He just plays a different  role as a PF now  He‚Äôs literally playing the same exact role he has for the rest of his entire career   &gt;who moves less so it's less noticed  Player movement tracking has him moving at the same rate he was at before injury.   &gt;but you see him unable to have that quick first step anymore as he struggled to blow by slow ass Brook Lopez.  This is just a flat out lie   &gt; He's just the most unique player ever so he can shoot over everyone  So he‚Äôs apparently declined, but still has the ability to shoot over anyone and get a bucket whenever he wants at the highest of levels? Make that make sense   &gt;2.	‚Å†Klay is not KD  He‚Äôs not, but he‚Äôs a perimeter based player whose game is based off skill not brute strength/ athleticism. His leg injuries aren‚Äôt going to hamper his game once he gets back into game shape.  &gt;has had worse injuries.   ACL injures don‚Äôt concern me at all. I‚Äôve recently seen 2 athleticism based guards in Zach Lavine and Dejounte Murray both come back from a torn ACL and not only retain their previous athleticism but become even better basketball players afterwards. The Achilles injury is more worrisome than the ACL injury but just like KD, klay is a skill based player and perimeter player. His body isn‚Äôt going to get beat up like Boogie and Kobe‚Äôs did simply based on playstyle.   &gt;Klay is top 5 in miles traveled and plays a lot of tough defensive assignments  He‚Äôll be load managed his first year so that won‚Äôt be a problem, and when talking about the defensive side this is the main reason they traded Dlo for Wiggins. Wiggins came into his own as a defender last season and more likely than not Dray and Wiggins will be the primary defenders.  &gt;I think GSW will be fine enough tho if they slide him to SF full time; 6'6"" is a good height for a SF and he fits better guarding those type of guys as he gets older nowadays anyway.  I don‚Äôt see them putting him at the 3 or guarding bigger more athletic 3s whatsoever I think doing so would increase his chance for another injury. They spent the last 2 years adding wings and forwards like Wiggins, Porter jr, Iggy, Kuminga and Moody for this very reason."
"Dejounte Murray + Keldon Johnson  Taking into account contracts, I think this is actually really fair. I'm definitely not including any FRPs"
ion watch this. seeing derrick rose and spencer dinwinddie over dejounte murray was astonishing enough for me to not see any od these lists anymore
"&gt;I think that‚Äôs a dangerous playoff team tbh -  that young group will grow tremendously, and actually have the chance to grow in that roster, without a big head ego dominating the ball.  You‚Äôre trolling.    &gt;You seriously overrate DJ, he‚Äôs good on instagram not so good in traffic.  You‚Äôre absolutely trolling.    &gt;Keldon is a leader. Devin is mature beyond his age. Luka should be turning up - we have players needing minutes and the ball. They won‚Äôt get it with DJ trying to pad his stats  Got it, so you‚Äôre a troll who completely bases nba productive based on nonexistent intangibles like; ‚Äúturning up, and mature beyond their age‚Äù and also apparently has a deep imbedded hatred for Dejounte Murray, but somehow is exclusively for Murray and not Simmons who ACTUALLY presents all these traits you‚Äôre trying to label upon Murray.   I‚Äôm not about to go back and fourth with a troll, bye."
dejounte murray and a healthy derrick white are the best defensive backcourt in the league and the baby spurs take the 5 seed
So you're telling me asking for half of the Raptors and the pick that became Scottie Barnes or Dejounte Murray and a ton of picks weren't reasonable?  Shocking.  And Morey told us our FO was in LaLaLand.
"I‚Äôm betting on San Antonio.   I think it‚Äôll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I‚Äôm going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I‚Äôll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I‚Äôd probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it‚Äôs not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they‚Äôd be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I‚Äôll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don‚Äôt see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn‚Äôt take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
&gt;You had multiple sources saying White and Murray where being shopped this off-season  all of them quoting the same guy on twitter (who writes for the Athletic) who was theorizing that Dejounte and White *could* be gettable because the spurs have so many guards.
Beal is an all nba calibre in my books in his last season of his contract given next is a player option..given wizards are looking to rebuild they should be able to get 2 legit  all star potential youngish guys and 2 unprotected picks imo... Levert/Brogdon ( though neither are young) +2 picks.. Dejounte Murray+Keldon Johnson+2 picks +/- lonnie walker/derrick white.
"I want other GMs to flip the offers Morey was making on the 76ers tbh.   ""Okay Daryl, we'll take Simmons, all we need is 4x unprotected first rounders, 3x pick swaps, and another young prospect. In exchange you get Dejounte Murray."""
"sixers: mccollum, derrick white, FRP   spurs: maxey, simmons   blazers: dejounte murray, thad young, FRP"
"For some of the Spurs young core, must include Dejounte Murray"
I'm legit worried that Dejounte Murray is a Klutch client and ALSO buddies with LeBron. Would not at all be surprised if the Lakers try to poach him one day.
"Harden got traded for literally the same package and you cannot tell me that Nets' Picks are as valuable as our since we still kinda suck while the Nets have KD, Kyrie, Harden locked for years to come while we would be bad. And Dejounte Murray is a better player with more potential than Caris LeVert. So basically the Sixers asked for more than what the Nets traded for James Harden. CRAZY"
"I didn't say this at all. I didn't say he should have rushed a trade at the first opportunity, it is definitely a dumb idea. What I am saying is that he undubitabely exagerrated with the asking price. Come on now, how can you ask 4 1st, 3 1st Swap, one young talent (Dejounte Murray) to the Spurs lmao. It's literally what the Nets traded for James Harden, I repeat, JAMES HARDEN. So what I'm saying is that he shouldn't have passed as a clown asking GMs crazy prices for a dude that it was possible didn't want to stay there (he informed the Sixers he wouldn't have trained with them during the summer), underperfmored in the Playoffs, never improved much sicne his entrance in the league. He coudl have explored trade destinations and see what they would have been willing to give up and see...  Let's see."
"Yeah exactly. I won't ever forget what he asked us for him: 4 1st, 3 1st Swap, 1 Young Talent (Possibly Dejounte Murray). This is crazy. This produces literally the opposite of interest. If I was an NBA GM and someone called me and asked me for such a thing I would gently decline but once I hang the phone I would make sure I would never consider that person credible and someone to do affairs. I mean, you reap what you sow."
"Jakob Poetle as the best player on the Spurs isn't even as crazy as having him, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray all above Brandon Ingram. Also Kawhi's comp this year is Paul George from last year, and the 40M less valuable PG's comp this year is Larry Bird from 89... that doesnt make any sense to me.   But hey Nate's a total math nerd so I will just accept this highly intellectual and math based prediction of the future, the best thing about math is the numbers are numbers, they cant lie."
Jamal plays in a completely different system than Murray. Spurs have historically spread their numbers throughout the team rather than a one man show.  Dejounte has way more defensive and play making responsibilities within the team.  Not throwing shade at jamal tho. He's a terrific player. He's a pure scorer and above avg play maker.
I'm simping for Dejounte Murray
"Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.   Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots.

"If they wanted to trade MPJ, they could definitely get a player better than Dejounte Murray"
Hot take : I doubt nugs want to pay MPJ  MPJ for Dejounte Murray + filler
Hopefully the Spurs fans who are Dejounte Murray dickriders see this
Dejounte Murray if he can stay healthy
Dejounte Murray
"the only guys the Paul thing affects are the lower guys, and even then there are still guys like DeJounte Murray who got 4/64. it's not like every non-max guy gets burned for being with Rich."
"idk about that these are just the top 14 behind LeBron  2. Anthony Davis ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers, PF/C  3. Ben Simmons ‚Äì Philadelphia 76ers, PG  4. Trae Young ‚Äì Atlanta Hawks, PG  5. John Wall ‚Äì Washington Wizards, PG  6. Eric Bledsoe ‚Äì Milwaukee Bucks, PG  7. Draymond Green ‚Äì Golden State Warriors, PF  8. Miles Bridges ‚Äì Charlotte Hornets, SF  9.

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers, SG  14. Tristan Thompson ‚Äì Cleveland Cavaliers, PF/C  15. Trey Lyles ‚Äì San Antonio Spurs, SF"
"Their clients are AD, Simmons, Trae Young, wall, Bledsoe, Draymond, Mikal, Kief, dejounte Murray, Jr, Marcus Morris, KCP, Tristan Thompson, Lyles, Harrel, and a whole bunch of other role players   Please tell me which of these have been an enormous win for the Lakers or Cavs"
"I mean sure it would improve but that's like going from a 74% on an exam to a 76% on the exam when you try it again. Yeah you did better, but it's still only a C.   And that's also not s guarantee we get better because say what you want about Simmons, but he's than Dejounte Murray right now."
&gt; Does anyone think that Dejounte Murray + Embiid would be better than what they currently have?  Yes they would definitely be better than what we saw against the Hawks.
"So a couple things I‚Äôve noticed with the bombardment of Simmons news recently.   1) most of the reports of what the Sixers are after are totally rubbish. ‚ÄúMorey asked the Celtics for Tatum‚Äù, ‚ÄúMorey asked Toronto for their entire team and picks!‚Äù Does anyone else see how these reports are completely fake?  2) Most of the packages being floated from Minnesota, Sacramento or San Antonio, does anyone actually think that D-Lo instead of Simmons on this team would actually make them better? Does anyone think that Dejounte Murray + Embiid would be better than what they currently have?  Simmons obviously has his struggles and the Atlanta series was awful, but people also forget his Washington series and how he closed them out without Embiid while putting up a triple double. What he brings to the table far far outweighs what he doesn‚Äôt."
"I expect Dejounte Murray to really make a name for himself this season.    He is a gym rat that places defense above all else. However, it'll be hard for him to be considered for DPOY if the Spurs are not in a spot to be competitive."
Dejounte Murray is the youngest player to ever make an NBA All Defensive Team
Also Derrick White is a natural playmaker who should run point but plays sg because Dejounte Murray

"Ja, Schroder, LeBron(if you count him), Shai(if you count him), Dejounte Murray, Fox, Simmons, Sexton(if you count him)."
"KCP got paid every year though.   Jordan Clarkson got paid.   Tristan got Paid. Gary Trent JR..Paid.  Terrence Ross, Dejounte Murray.  Marcus Morris had a great deal from the Spurs but Marcus turned it down.   Mikes Bridges, Darius Garland‚Ä¶all got paid well.    So where is this narrative that if you‚Äôre not a star e doesn‚Äôt get you paid?"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"What I'm saying, mind you, is based on the play patterns of a group of players with a few hundred, at most, NBA games under their belts. It also relies on Derrick White staying healthy for the majority of the season which is certainly not a safe bet.   Projecting the playing time and rate distribution for a team over the course of an entire season is difficult and the difficultly level grows exponentially with each piece in the rotation that is adjusted.   For example, if you asked me to give you the likelihood of a player leading the Dallas Mavericks in possessions used next season I would break it down something like this:   Luka Doncic - 95%  THJ - 2.5%  Kristaps Porzingis - 1.5%   Other - 1%  If I was answering the question for the Spurs it would look, roughly, like this:   Derrick White - 35%  Dejounte Murray - 30%  Keldon Johnson - 19%   Lonnie Walker - 7%   Tre Jones - 3%  Josh Primo - 2%   Devin Vassell - 1.5%   Other - 2.5%"

"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, D Rose is an elite sixth man and carried the Knicks in the playoffs. But Dejounte Murray is a very good starter who defends much better than Rose and is a decent offensive player."

"The usage and playing time voids created by the departures of DeRozan and Rudy Gay are substantial. However, based on the data from last season, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, and Derrick White are the most likely beneficiaries of that void."
"DeJounte Murray, and my hopeful wildcard is one or all of Lonnie Walker/Devin Vassell/Kelson Johnson."
"Yep, it‚Äôs definitely new territory for us. I‚Äôm 30, Tim was drafted when I was 6. We‚Äôre a totally different team than we were for the majority of my life.   I‚Äôve actually been excited about this new roster tho. It‚Äôs cool having a a fun exciting young squad that‚Äôs figuring it out together and I am expecting they grow as a unit and get better next year. So it feels like a lot less pressure than when we were going to the playoffs every year.   Plus I love dejounte murray."
"Not the absolute worst, but the start of a long line of really poor trades and signings. The last time the Blazers had a bunch of young talent they‚Ä¶  Blazers traded:  - Will Barton and a first round pick that became Malik Beasley (&amp; Thomas Robinson, victor claver)  To Denver for: -Arron Afflalo (&amp; Alonzo gee), to replace injured Wesley Mathews.   Afflalo goes from shooting 50% mid range to 39% and injures his shoulder in 2 months. Leaves blazers a few months later in free agency to the knicks. Out of the league 3 years later.   Matthews after tearing his Achilles leaves blazers in free agency for dallas. Comes back from injury, goes on to be a 3 and D journeyman.   Comparable first round picks (#19 and lower) in 2016 included: - Malik Beasley (Por first round pick to Den) - Caris levert - pascal siakam - dejounte Murray - Malcolm brogdon  Will Barton (who was close with Damian Lillard) while suffering from off and on injuries, has gone on to sign multiple contracts with Denver, whether he has been in the starting lineup or coming off the bench he has averaged approx. 14/3/5 (fg 43%/3fg 36%) with just under a steal a game in his 8 seasons with Denver. While portland has struggled to find a consistent figure to lead a bench unit or fill the sf position."

"If the spurs traded away Dejounte Murray for Ben Simmons it‚Äôd be highway robbery for the 76ers. DJ‚Äôs obviously got a lower ceiling but his floor is way higher, DJ is a leader and a great influence on the spurs which would do more for the 76ers than ben does. Ben is a slightly better defender (although DJ was all defensive 2nd team before his injury in 2019) but DJ would offer so much more offensively. He‚Äôs just understated because he plays in San Antonio post Duncan. They‚Äôre honestly super comparable players they‚Äôre both 25 but DJ is better coached and isn‚Äôt afraid to shoot."
I can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt changed your opinion on Russ. I mean this one game against the legendary Spurs squad led by Poeltl and Dejounte Murray has got me convinced.
Dejounte Murray... Stats holy fuck
"He hasn't been played much in the regular season, but the flashes he's shown in preseason and summer camp have spurs fans *very* excited. When they blew out Orlando, there was legit chants for Primo through most of the fourth quarter. Spurs fans are very excited to see what they have with him. He plays with a swagger and confidence and poise that 18 year olds don't really ever show, and he makes shots that many of the Spurs' veterans (lonnie walker, dejounte murray, derrick white, etc) aren't taking at all.   Overall: So far so good. Hasn't played much. Spurs fans excited. Will probably get stashed in g-league as is spurs tradition once that season starts. Will earn his stripes and then we'll see."

I do love Dejounte Murray
"Not really struggling to get by his man, it's usually when he meets big man that's the issue with him at the rim.  Midrange - I think he just likes the shot honestly. If he's open he'll take it. They aren't like heavily contested, he just hasn't been knocking them down yet.  Handle - it was rough in the preseason and he got tipped/picked a lot, especially against Marcus Smart and Dejounte Murray. It's been much better in the regular season, but it's definitely something he needs to work on. I like having keeping him at the 2 for this season because of that."
Derrick white and Dejounte Murray could probably play on it idk about the rest
"Not be-all, end-all, but Dejounte Murray worth $3m more than BI doesn‚Äôt sit right"
"Herro, Reddish, and I'm hoping to see dejounte Murray breakout (I think he was on the verge to before injury)."
I think Dejounte Murray deserves a mention. Come back in three years and I bet Lonnie Walker is in the mix as well

A player that comes to mind is Dejounte Murray. The combination of his length and knack for the ball is something special.
"My point is that once Ben is off our roster we will have no feasible way of significantly improving our roster for the remainder of Embiids prime. What happens with Ben is it it‚Äôs done after that. We‚Äôre not a big FA destination, we won‚Äôt have any big trade pieces, and no high draft picks. But you‚Äôre delusional to think that Ben + some young players + picks or a three way trade to get Ben to Minnesota or somewhere for more picks/young players wouldn‚Äôt be a very good trade package for a star IF the ask out. Now that‚Äôs a big if granted but that‚Äôs the only way we get another star on our team and I highly doubt we win the championship without one. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre not going to be a playoff team as long as Embiid stays relatively healthy. So unless you think the sixers have a shot to win the championship with Dejounte Murray Lonnie Walker and some picks what opportunity is being burned for Embiid?"
"I don't have a particular team I root for nowadays, but I do like a few teams and follow a ton of players like Steph+Klay on the Warriors, Giannis, Trae, Luka. Former Sonics players like KD+Jeff Green. I also root for alma mater UW players like Thybulle, Dejounte Murray, etc. Fantasy Bball always helps too.   After the Seattle Kraken debut a couple weeks ago, I've been down bad missing my Supersonics."
Hell yea man Dejounte Murray is one of my favorite guards in the league so I always look forward to San Antonio
"Ignoring this saga completely, suppose you did a 2016 redraftables...just based on on-court stuff.   Even then, I don't think he's #1 anymore, is he?   I think you'd still take him over Brogdon, at least due to age. I'm not totally convinced he's a better player than Dejounte Murray. DJ has shown more development, and is nearly the same class of defender. I'm not totally convinced he's a better player than Sabonis. I think he's *clearly* behind Jaylen Brown. What about Ingram? Siakam? Jamal Murray? I think he's better, but not by much. You can talk yourself into ""Ben Simmons is not a top-5 guy from his draft class."""

Acting like future FMVP Dejounte Murray isn‚Äôt dropping 50 on Russ‚Äôs head on Tuesday
"yeah literally no one else on the pelicans has gained weight like that outside of like E'Twuan Moore. lol Ingram still looks the same. this is a Zion problem, not NO.   I've been fat as shit at times in my life, and I can assure you, Zion runs enough for his job there's no excuse to be 300 pounds at 6'6"". this dude is an inch taller than DeJounte Murray and weighs a hundred more pounds. Its unsustainable.   I assure you, he will not play as long as he should if he's heavier than 280, and even that is more than he should play at. he would be losing fat, not muscle, to get to 275. all he loses is weight, and while that can have value, he'd gain so much speed and improve his longevity so much, it's worth."
"538's 5 year value estimates of various players (not be-all, end-all, just a reference point):  - Simmons: $156 - Brown: $129m - Jamal Murray: $143m - Ingram: $100m - Siakam: $72m - Sabonis: $107m - Brogdon: $54m - Levert: $53m - Dejounte Murray: $103m  I'm taking Jamal Murray."

Saying any All Defense level player is way better than the other is hyperbole, Especially with a 30 game sample size to back it up."

"You mean the guy that had a generational talent that they had built a team around quit playing, forced a trade, and tanked his trade value somehow missed a few playoffs afterward? Lets ignore that while Kawhi was nursing his injury, Pop still somehow got a terrible line-up to the playoffs that year, and then the next two years competed until the very last week of the season to fight for a playoff spot.   Seriously, look at the line-up he managed to get into the 2018 playoffs (2nd yr Dejounte Murray/washed up Tony Parker who avg 7ppg, Danny Green, washed up Gasol, Kyle Anderson, and Aldridge). Name me one other coach in the league you think could take that starting lineup to the playoffs."
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
Dejounte Murray
I‚Äôm just a bit biased as a huge Lonnie fan haha. I do think Dejounte Murray can provide ~70% of Simmons‚Äô production with a small bit of shooting.
"ngl I'd love to see a Dejounte Murray / Ben Simmons defensive back court. Talk about negative spacing though  A Simmons/Anunoby/Barnes/Siakam/Boucher positionless lineup would also be cool to see from a basketball standpoint, but no way that happens imo  Who would Detroit move? No way they trade Cunningham, and Grant probably isn't enough (and they probably refuse to move him either)  Indiana makes sense to me but I feel like Ben would refuse to report. Same with Cleveland  Sacramento moving Hield and Davion, Minny moving Malik, Bev, and McDaniels, or Portland moving CJ make the most sense to me"
"&gt;  The Pistons would ‚Äúentertain‚Äù trading Jerami Grant for Simmons, the Sixers don‚Äôt seem interested in a Spurs package including Dejounte Murray and Lonnie Walker IV (which is fair enough), and the Kings aren‚Äôt discussing any deals that include either De‚ÄôAaron Fox or Tyrese Haliburton.  If those are still the deals on the table in December I don't think a trade is likely.  Grant is fine and on a fair deal but i'd rather wait for Ben to come around, at least until closer to the trade deadline."
"I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre the best but the already great Bucks defense with Dejounte Murray now their starting PG, jesus. That defense would be incredible"
Dejounte Murray is one of the better perimeter defenders idk if I‚Äôd give him the nod over tisse or smart though  Kawhi is riding mostly off rep at this point. He doesn‚Äôt bring it every night like he used to
Lamelo seems a bit high  Conley also seems a bit high  Dejounte Murray should be above Lonzo IMO

"Just listing guys (but I've also seen rankings with him like 17th). And it depends who counts as a PG  Curry, Dame, Fox, Shai, Cp3, Ja, Kyrie/Harden, Trae, Lowry, Brogdon, Jrue, Conley, J Murray, Simmons,if he counts are all definitively better. That's 14 guys definitely better than him. 15 if you count luka as a PG.   Then guys like Lamelo, Cade, Russ, Dinwiddie, Dejounte Murray are probably on par. Only one needs to be better than him for him to be a below average starting PG in the nba."
"Yes he is. There are 30 starting point guards. If there are 15 starting point guards better than you then you are below average. 15th best is average. I can easily name 15 better than DLO. (Not in order) 1. Curry 2. Luka 3. Dame 4. Kyrie/harden 5. Westbrook 6. Fox 7. SGA 8. CP3 9. Ja 10. Trae 11. Jrue 12. Brogdon 13. Lowry 14. Jamal Murray 15. Conley. There are others that I‚Äôd debate as well: Simmons (I get the hate but still a great facilitator and defender), Lamelo (he‚Äôs still young but I can def see him being better), Lonzo (good defender and solid shooter/facilitator, I think his defense brings him over DLO), dinwiddie (arguable maybe leaning towards DLO tho), dejounte Murray (DLO is better on offense but his defense is miles ahead of DLO, could outweigh the offense), vanvleet (I think DLO better but vanvleet is up there), Kemba, and Rozier. That‚Äôs 15 better and like 8 debatably better. He‚Äôs def below average"
1. Jaylen Brown 2. KD 3. CP3 4. Dejounte Murray 5. Shai/PG13/Tatum
"So I guess most of spurs fan base has the same mentality and we‚Äôre all casuals   Just look at the numbers anyways, https://www.statspros.com/ben-simmons-vs-dejounte-murray-stats/"
"I think a clear distinction is that Vassell and Murray are both young, yes, but different levels of Young. Murray and Thad will be the biggest contributors the coming season, which IMO isn't really better than Simmons + Picks.  Vassell may turn out to be a stud in the future, and he's a solid contributor already (still needs developing), but you have to consider that your 25 yr all 3x all star will likely (he might not, hopefully won't) age differently by say even his late 20s because of injury concerns. By the time Vassell is great, Thad will probably be retired. Dejounte might be peaking, but Embiid might not be the same. Though they're a young team, Sixers are still ""win now"" mode"

Simmons + Tobi + Picks for Dejounte Murray and filler before the deadline lol
"just for me, and ignoring the cavs, dame/steph, and the rookies (since they haven't played yet)   - for the east; jaylen brown, harden, the rose in the garden, vanvleet, derozan, Middleton, giannis, lamelo   - in the west; edwards, towns, SGA, cj, Mitchell, draymond (yes, watching draymond orchestrate/play D is really enjoyable), klay if he comes back, Westbrook, fox, haliburton, luka, kpj, ja, dejounte Murray   - i omitted a lot of bigs, so after looking back at the roster i'd say I'm also looking forward to watching embiid, sabonis, bam, mafuzzy chef, porzingis and adams"
"Being a good team for a year‚â†good organization and being a bad team for a year‚â†bad organization. Spurs have one of the worst teams this year, does that mean they have one of the worst organizations in the league? No obv not. They‚Äôre coaching staff, development staff, and scouts are all elite. Just look at what they‚Äôve been doing with low draft picks like keldon Johnson and dejounte Murray. Absolute insane organization"
"Teams would have to provide more assets because the asset they‚Äôre offering isn‚Äôt equal in value to Simmons.   The contract can both be an overpay and still desirable, depending on the situation. Teams may deem it an overpay now; but they have faith that Simmons may improve in the future and live up to the contract.   Simmons is overpaid relative to his production - he ranks in the 60th percentile for win shares, whereas max contract players rank above the 80th percentile. The contract was given due to his potential, not current ability, and he‚Äôs clearly not living up to his potential as he‚Äôs regressed offensively from his rookie year.   Simmons‚Äô production last year, including advanced stats, is similar to that of Dejounte Murray and Domontas Sabonis. Both of which are paid under 20m. That means he‚Äôs overpaid both relative to his production and his peers in the league"
"Dejounte murray, draymond green, mason plumlee, lonzo,"
Dejounte Murray isn‚Äôt too bad of a pick later in the draft
"Lamelo, Dejounte Murray, Draymond Green, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis, Ben Simmons üòñ"
"Dejounte Murray, no bias"
KCP got paid though? Corey Joseph? Eric Bledsoe? Dejounte Murray?
"Calm down? You think that was anger because you got owned?  Defensive teams don't matter, it's the worst award  Shane Battier has 0 defensive teams despite being the career 3&amp;D guy, DeJounte Murray playing 24 minutes a game got one"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"I mentioned it in another comment but I watched how Demar thoroughly tanked the spurs defense despite being backed up by Dejounte Murray and Jakob poeltl, two of the best defenders in the league. I think he‚Äôs going to cause huge problems without a rim protector cleaning up for him. But maybe I‚Äôm not giving the bench enough credit for what they‚Äôll be able to do"
"Dejounte Murray. Love his consistent growth, attitude, and all around game. That face tattoo on his right arm is still one of the worst I've seen on a player though lol."
"Dejounte Murray, Primo/White/Vassell/Walker, Emoni Bates, Keldon Johnson, Chet Holmgren/Victor Wembanyama."
DeJounte Murray. 5 years in he has some flashes but thats it
"sure but he's sharing the ball with LaVine, Vucevic, and Ball instead of Dejounte Murray and Rudy Gay... his stats will 100% see a drop this year rather than stay level or go up.  I could see him upping the efficiency as he picks his spots better though."
"In **South East** I'd change Suggs and Hayward for LaMelo and Isaac to have:  Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Bam Adebayo.   In **South West** I'd change Thad Young for Dejounte Murray straight up.  In terms of rankings, I'd go:  1. **Pacific** \- LeBron, Steph and Kawhi is just too much. Especially with a rim-running big man and a lights-out shooter.  2. **North West** \- When the worst player in your lineup is Shai and you have elite shooting throughout, that's scary. 3. **Atlantic** \- my one concern here is that unless FVV develops it, there isn't really an elite playmaker in this lineup.  4. **South East** \- Massive firepower in Trae, LaMelo and Beal, and then you bank on there being enough defense from Isaac and Bam to cover it. Isaac and Beal won't be taking a shot.  5. **Central** \- Lots of talent in the lineup but the lack of versaility made me put them so low. Their 3-5 can't really shoot from the perimeter. 6. **South West** \- Honestly, just the last talent?"
Is that really a hot take?  I mean their best player is who... Dejounte Murray...?  Hotter take: Spurs are actively tanking this season.
Dejounte Murray
Dejounte Murray tore his ACL in preseason
Dejounte Murray blew out his ACL in the preseason a couple years ago. That was a pretty low point for Spurs fans :(

"And Brogdon, LeVert, and Dejounte Murray. Buddy Hield isn‚Äôt even in the discussion for the 5th best player from that draft"
"Absolutely wild that you‚Äôve got Hield in that group from 2016. He‚Äôs worse than Ingram, LeVert, Siakam, Dejounte Murray and Brogdon, he shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near this list"
Dejounte Murray is the longest tenured Spurs player. And he just turned 25
I was excited for DeJounte Murray a few years ago but he had that injury and hasn‚Äôt been the same since‚Ä¶ I thought he‚Äôd be
"DRAPTOR pretty much always favour interior players over perimeter guys. There's a reason that they listed Rudy Gay as almost a top 10 defensive player last year, while Dejounte Murray was a net zero defender - and it is absolutely not that Rudy is the better defender.  There are a few exceptions, but thats basically how it goes.  Do you really think Drummond and Gasol were muchbetter defenders than Lebron last year?"
"I‚Äôm optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
I think if Jon Isaac can stay healthy he can be all defense firs team  I do like Dejounte Murray as well
"Dejounte Murray and Lonnie walker  Also, hate the heat but I like pretty much every player on the roster. Duncan, Jimmy, Kyle, bam, they all seem like good dudes and play hard."
I'm skeptical of these Dejounte Murray claims. He's passing and rebounding a lot but he has a TS% of 49.7
"Dejounte Murray, Tyler hero , Harrison Barnes, Og, DeAndre ayton.   Bench. Jonas, Mikal bridges, lonzo, MO bamba, Cole Anthony."
"Morant, Dejounte Murray, OG, Tobias Harris, Turner.  Bench: Herro, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, John Collins, Ayton.  I don't know if that's a contender but I think that's about as balanced as I can get on offense and defense."

GSW wouldn't be where they are w/o Steph, Suns wouldn't w/o CP3, Bucks don't win until they land Jrue, Raptors w/o Lowry, so on etc."

Dejounte Murray won‚Äôt be an all star
Dejounte Murray and Russell Westbrook maybe
"Smart, Lonzo, Holiday, Simmons (when not socializing), Dejounte Murray,  are the elite starting PG defenders IMO. But some of those guys are more physically imposing than Steph. I'd say he's as good at you can be on defense without being an athletic freak."
Dejounte Murray and Derrick white are quality
"The small markets usually have to over pay a little. Not surprised, but this.   Russell westbrook and dejounte Murray. 19 8 8. Westbrook 20.8.9.   41million westbrook and Murray 18 million.   Another one is pascal siakam. 17 7 3 for 31 million dollars. Kristaps gets cloned but averages better as a second option. Same contract    The raptors rookie is 2 points shy of their star player lol. Everything else better."
Replace Shai with Dejounte Murray and it‚Äôs better. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a ludicrous take to want Murray over Russ due to defense

I'm a big Dejounte Murray fan but Lamelo is a fair bit better than him offensively.
Ben Simmons is a shittier Dejounte Murray.
you really think the kings or the dejounte murray spurs are passing them? i hate the lakers as much as any right-thinking person but even i can't go that far
"Ok bro. Next time there is a Miles Bridges MIP chat you go mention how you think Dejounte should be MIP and see how that goes over. The reality of Reddit is commenting something like I did in a dejounte murray thread will get me shit on because it‚Äôs a bunch of Murray fans reading it, but it‚Äôs 100% factual and any unbiased person knows it.

Dejounte Murray been putting up massive numbers. unfortunately not translating to wins though.
"Dearon Fox &amp; Ja Morant (prior to this year)  Dejounte Murray, Bledsoe and Simmons have been successful, although not scoring wise"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"&gt; Have more pride in your teams and watching the growth of your young players, nerd out about the plays your players are making, and remember that 1 win is 1 win, no matter if its Lebron James or Dejounte Murray you just beat.  There's 82 games. Nobody cares that a team won a game they were supposed to win away on a wednesday night. With so many teams committing to being bad, and other teams accidentally being bad, lots of games just aren't interesting even if you're a big fan."
"Counting stats can hardly enter the conversation to justify a CP3 all-nba team, and I'm really reluctant to lean heavily on things like WS/48 or BPM for a player on a team that is on such a win-streak because then we're looking at a take that says the difference between an all-nba player in Chris Paul (.232 WS/48) and Frank Kaminsky (.241 WS/48) is 9 assists a game (Kaminsky 10ppg on 63.5 TS% and CP3 14ppg on 58 TS%). Advanced stats, this early on don't have a steady connection to a players ability and CP3 has not got the counting stats to compete with players like Dejounte Murray even if we heavily weight them toward assists.  Basically, yes, I get it, you have to find the compromise somewhere but CP3 on the list reeks of advanced stats counting for *some* players, team record counting for *some* players, boxscores counting for *some* players."

Dejounte Murray  Devin Vassell Josh primo Keldon Johnson  Derrick white  Jakob poeltl Tre Jones  Lonnie Walker
Dejounte Murray has been really fun this year. He clearly learned from DeMar with the mid-range game on top of being electric in transition.
"DeJounte Murray is like easily the least talked about member of this group. dude is doing fucking everything for this team and they just shit the bed the entire time he's off the floor. if he was on a premier team like the 76ers, Bucks, or Lakers, he'd be viewed as an all star caliber guy."
"No love in this thread for Dejounte Murray, decent stats and crazy good defense, just the Spurs suck this year and no one pays attention to them"
"so very similar to Dejounte Murray, who isn‚Äôt even in the discussion"
Fred vanvleet and Dejounte Murray
"If Dejounte Murray was in the east he'd be in the conversation. Was 20/8/8 a few games ago, which is better than a lot of the guards in the east the last few years."
"i dont think we need to blow it up and reset. we very easily could but its also very possible to make a trade or two and stay competitive. trading sabonis is the big what if as hes one of the top big men in the league and the only player that can replicate even a fraction of jokic, so he could definitely pull a haul, just a matter of what he can get for the direction the FO would take, if any.  personally i think the team is already a little too late to do anything too drastic after resigning brogdon, who im starting to peg as the source of many of the teams problems. i was really wanting to see a trade involving him for dejounte murray this last offseason. either way i dont think we should waste having a top 5 coach so we should trade (i think) sabonis for someone that can facilitate better than brogdon or caris so they can play more off ball. but it wont happen because the pacers are the definition of stubborn so i will just root for the same shitty team i have the past 3 years"
"Their position affords them so much potential value. Centers can be, and these two are, good rebounders, all world defenders, (in the case of embiid) efficient 28 ppg scorers. Dort just doesn't have the firepower to overcome that. It's like Dejounte Murray right now. Since his first three games he's averaging 21 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists. He's top 5 in assists per game. Nobody else in the top 20 assists per game besides Chris paul is averaging as few turnovers per assists. There's an argument that dejounte is the second best passer in the league stats wise, the best or second best rebounding guard, and he's 8th in steals per game while playing amazing all around defense. Despite all of that, nobody is going to call him a superstar. And they shouldn't. He just doesn't score the ball enough.  To recap: Dejounte Murray has an argument for being top 2-4 for every single base skill you'd want out of a point guard besides scoring. And on top of that he's almost averaging 20 a game on career high efficiency if you just remove the first 3 games he started ice cold. Yet he doesn't get called a superstar. Dort could and some people might say he definitely will be a better player than dejounte, but dejounte give you everything you want out of a guard and it's still not enough. I just don't see it for dort unless he has a complete change in his scoring profile/ability."
DeJounte Murray should be on the west snubs list over Dame
Dejounte Murray
"I read this the other day   Spurs Receive: Russell Westbrook.    Lakers Receive: Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Thaddeus Young"
"Dejounte Murray, Marcus Smart, Lonzo Ball, and Gary Trent Jr. are all guards who are better defenders than curry too.  &gt;Not to mention, through 15 games Stephs D isnt bad and could improve, it has been anyway  His defense has been solid for a few years, he exerts an impressive amount of effort on that side of the ball. It's part of what separates him from players like Lillard. He's still not close to being an all-defense selection though.  &gt;I dont think he will get all defense, but its just stupid to say he cant.  I didn't say he can't. I said it'd be possibility because voters love him (e.g. 3rd place in MVP voting as a non-playoff team last year). I could definitely see him getting the nod over somebody more deserving like Vanvleet or Trent Jr."
"Idgaf about ""rating them for all-defensive team"". Curry isn't sniffing all defensive team. This whole discussion is for you to understand that all-defense players LOOK LIKE GPII on the floor (forget about stats, talking about your eye test), but for more minutes. Bledsoe, Holiday, Dejounte Murray, Simmons. You watch them and you know, this is an all defense caliber guard.  Curry is not even close to that level. He's above average for his position but that's it. Arguing here that Curry deserves all-defense because he tries, he runs around the floor a lot and some extremely inaccurate statistic said so is just a bad look. You make HIM look bad too. I like him and you make me attack him lmao.  I'm out. Stop being a homer."

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray   Oof
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.   Yikes all around
I would love Dejounte Murray on the Sixers
"I think Dejounte Murray could be in, maybe over Barnes"
Sga and lamelo would take Conley and kyrie spots guranteed. Plus trae young would take simmons.   Zion spot going to Kat. Kawhi spot would be draymond or Wiggins. I don't know their numbers if someone wants to tell me.   Dame  spot ;  hoping for fans vote for dejounte Murray who's averaging what Ben simmons should be 18.8.8 2 stls
I would not trade any of those players for Simmons maybe besides Dejounte Murray
"You didn't deserve downvotes (hate that about this sub), but Kemba and Russell are just TURRIBLE analytically.  They suck, they're team killers.    Derrick Rose, VanVleet, and Dejounte Murray are better candidates than those two."
"I would take out damian lillard unless his numbers go up and put in dejounte Murray. Both players teams don't look like playoff teams.   Murray, is dropping a cool 19ppg 8rb 8ast 2.1stls.  Lillard is 20ppg 4rb 5ast 0.7 stls .  Other then that. A perfect list. Oh Booker over lillard as well. All his numbers are better"
"They've done well, but those were some high picks also. Its a lot easier to draft well when you pick at #2 every year.  * Randle at 7 was a good pick, but not the best pick in that draft or anything. Still, I'd say he'd go higher in a redraft so props to them for the pick. * Rusell went #2 in 2015. People have a wide range of opinions, I tend to think he's overrated. Not a bust or anything, but you figure they'd pick up Booker in a redraft, and probably also take Porzingis and Myles Turner ahead of him. The Lakers got Larry Nance late in this draft, which I do think is actually a really good pick. I'd rather have him than Russell, honestly. * Ingram #2 in 2016. Another good, not great pick. Went before Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Brogdon and Dejounte Murray. Not sure how a redraft would go, but probably he isn't the 2nd best player in the draft. * Lonzo went #2 in 2017 right ahead of Tatum. Bam and Donovan Mitchell also went in the lottery that year. I think he goes behind those guys for sure in a redraft, and also maybe Fox, Jarret Allan, OG, and John Collins. Not a bust, but probably not like a great pick either.  Overall I'd say good but not great picks. They didn't get any real busts, so I give them credit, but they also picked super high 3 years in a row. They could have a team with Randle, Booker, Turner, Siakam, and Donovan Mitchell or something and win 70 games."
"all i know is that win or lose, there's dejounte murray simping in every spurs post game thread  if that ain't consistently positive, i don't know what is"
I was about to say that lol. A spiked up derozan who can shoot the 3. The athleticism of Zach lavine. Defense of dejounte Murray or jrue holiday.
"I‚Äôll take 1 Dejounte Murray, hold the Russ thanks"
"Tyrese Maxey is averaging 18 a game on 60% TS, Murray is the better player right now due to his superior defense and passing, but I'd hardly say the Sixers are crestfallen for not getting Dejounte when Maxey is playing as well as he is so far."
"I'll bite on this.  Do you think the 6ers could use a point guard averaging 19/8/8 and 2 steals, that is shooting 33% from 3PG on 4 attempts per game? What about if that player is on a $15M a season team friendly deal for the next 3 seasons?  That's Dejounte Murray right now.  When the Spurs said they were interested in Ben Simmons, who do you think was the likely at the centre of that trade scenario?  Is this one of the role players that won't help the 6ers? They missed that bus. I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of teams just refuse to engage with Morey at all now after his ridiculous  trade requests.  Also, you really think Lillard is looking at how this guy operates, and is saying, yeah, get me out of Portland, I wanna deal with this guy?"
need russ and dejounte murray on the heat
He won't win it but Dejounte Murray is quickly turning into a full blown nightmare for opposing point guards.

"Because I refuse to be talked to like that. By anyone!  ""Saying Dejounte Murray is making a case for MVP is the definition of ignorance.""  I never once said that he is making a case for MVP, did I?  I asked if anyone thought that he MIGHT be making an EARLY CASE for MVP. Huge difference.   What I don't understand is why it's not just better to say, ""No, I in no way think he's making an early case for MVP."" Why is it better to say I'm making a case for the most ignorant NBA fan? Are you trying to get as many laughs from the sub as possible? Does it make you cool to belittle people?  One might say that it is much more ignorant to call someone ignorant for saying something he simply did not say. Unless you're just not very well versed in the English language, in which case, I forgive you. Because, again, me asking if anyone thought he MIGHT be making an EARLY CASE for MVP is in no way me saying that I believe he IS making a case for MVP."
I'm not belittling you. You're doing that yourself. Saying Dejounte Murray is making a case for MVP is the definition of ignorance.  And you're calling me a girl like that's gonna show me. Why did you delete your post?
Dejounte Murray: **MVP OF SAN ANTONIO**
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.   I counted another triple double but the stats disagree. Triple double in my heart üò§
Dejounte Murray is the next breakout all star like Zach lavine  Spurs roster is garbage tho
"Simmons, CP3 ,Lowry ,Lonzo, Jrue, Brogdon,Van Vleet, Smart, Dejounte Murray. Probably forgetting a few but there‚Äôs 10."
"I think Tim Duncan is a top 10 player of all time but putting him in the Top 5 is overrating him. Some of those All-nba he got towards the end was when the center position was incredibly weak and he wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. Both of his MVPs where extremely close and he probably should only have won one. Best winrate in the NBA probably has more to do with the fact that he was always surrounded with a good team. What happened after duncan retired? the spurs won 61, 47(kawhi missed the first 27 games), 48 (no Dejounte Murray) games right around 50ish games each season, probably has more to do with pop being a great coach then it does with duncan. Duncan is also the only NBA center to fail to win an Olympic Gold medal -- and the 2004 Team USA he captained was a complete embarrassment, somehow getting blown out by Puerto Rico, which is obviously a US territory. I find Duncan to be overrated on the defensive end, often times he wasn't even the best defender on his own team. He only occasionally was the leading vote-getter on the Spurs. Duncan was behind Robinson, Bowen, or Leonard way more often than not. 2001, 2003, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2013 were the only seasons that Duncan was the top DPOY vote-getter on his team -- and in 2009-11, he was way down the overall list in the teens, and notably those are the seasons in which he did not have a much better defensive teammate. Duncan was exceedingly lucky with his teammates in general, but particularly so on the defensive side. He's one of very few players to play with two DPOY winners, and the only one to play with 2 winners, plus a 3-time runner-up."
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
jesus christ you guys are obsessed with playoffs as some benchmark for success. tell me when Dejounte Murray shoots 47% TS% over the last 5 playoffs
I‚Äôd take Dejounte murray over Russ.
He went from having Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White being the best players on the roster besides him to Zach Lavine &amp; Lonzo Ball. Defenses were ecstatic when pretty much anybody besides DeMar tried to score in the half court especially in crunch time last year but you can't do that with the Bulls cause they're just far more talented.
Damn Dejounte Murray in top 10 for both and #2 behind Paul for steals  and Russ in there too
- Gary Trent Jr  - LaMelo Ball  - Evan Mobley  - Montrezl Harrell  - Cole Anthony  - Richuan Holmes   - Grayson Allen  - Tyler Herro   - Dejounte Murray  - Jonas Valanciunas
Dejounte Murray as well iirc
"Drafting another generational talent would be a good stepping stone probably  In all seriousness, I could see them going after Colin Sexton. Dejounte Murray would be a good fit next to him as the defensive guard and the main playmaker."

DM  Dejounte Murray  Donovan Mitchell  Dan Majerle  Danny Manning  Dikembe Mutumbo
"well, there's an argument. the problem is he wasn't a lead scorer which is usually a prerequisite for the fringe guys to get in. i do think since he was the main stopper on the showtime Lakers, he should be in there. he was a unique player, his build reminds me of DeJounte Murray but he was obviously not expected to be even a top three offensive player on those teams. i think there a re a lot of guys who could be in. I'm a big walter davis guy, personally."
It was pretty clear he was the 3rd best at Kentucky after Washington and Herro.   He's supposed to be a PF/SF but only at 6'5 so maybe thats why he fell late to 29. Spurs got 2 quality guys in Dejounte Murray and him both at pick 29
that was fucking hilarious  Dejounte Murray is strong enough to knock over LeBron James
"It‚Äôs wood rn, but Garland, Dejounte Murray, Bridges, LW4, brown and MPJ all also look good"
Dejounte Murray should be in the discussion.
DEJOUNTE MURRAY.  REMEMBER THE NAME
Dejounte fucking Murray ladies and gents!

I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray!
I LOVE DEJOUNTE MURRAY
DEJOUNTE MURRAY
I am here to simp for dejounte Murray as well as remind everyone that curry is still absolutely insane
I'm buying a fucking Dejounte Murray jersey.
There's Dejounte Murray! And...uhhh...hmmm.....
That Aldridge is our second best player. It's Dejounte Murray.
"FWIW some of it is totally self inflicted. Trading Kawhi to Toronto just to spite the Lakers really bit y'all in the ass, Spurs could be sitting on a lineup of:   C: Center signed in FA  PF: DƒÅvis BertƒÅns / Rudy Gay  SF: Brandon Ingram / Keldon Johnson  SG: Lonzo Ball / Derrick White  PG: Dejounte Murray   but some of it is out of y'alls control. Letting BertƒÅns walk to sign Morris and then Morris bails last minute wasn't y'alls fault."
"I‚Äôd rather have Dejounte and miss the playoffs every year.   Irrational, yes. But I love Murray."
I definitely can see a Ben Simmons Dejounte Murray trade happening.
"Dejounte Murray just had basically the same season as ben did stats wise (look it up, its actually ridiculously close) and gets paid less than half of what simmons does"
Already have Dejounte Murray there. Simmons contract makes him insanely tough to trade and his trade value is already at its lowest. Morey always tries to pull some shit so any team that tries it might get fleeced
They already have rich man's Ben Simmons in Dejounte Murray. But I guess Simmons can come off the bench when Dejounte is in foul trouble.
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
"i would take Pop over say a Carmelo/Chris Bosh type of player. When I say Pop I mean the whole Spurs FO that was able to scout, develop, coach Tony, Manu, Kawhi,  Derrick White, Tiago, Keldon Johnson, George Hill, DeJuan Blair, Dejounte Murray, Danny Green (cut by the worst team in the league), Aaron Baynes, Boban, Patty Mills (never played meaningful mins in Portland), Jonathan Simmons"
"DeJounte Murray because he's like Ed Reed in passing lanes and Derrick White because he's the best blocking guard since Dwyane Wade, unless you call Thybulle a guard rather than a wing."
"Murray who? Jamal Murray denver hangs up and Dejounte is laughable. And sure, I'm biased, but I don't see DLO or Brogdon being better options/players than CJ McCollum.   Lavine would be a good one though. Not sure how Chicago fans would feel about that, but if I'm Philly I'd trade Ben for Lavine."
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
"Lmao the recency bias here is real. Simmons is still a top 2 defender and an elite passer. OP can you please list 10 players better than him? Siakam, Brown, Ingram and maybe Sabonis have an argument to be selected over Ben. Then it's Murray, Hield, ...Levert? Dejounte Murray? Korkmaz? Malik Beasley? That's 10, and you still have 5 more players you would draft before him?  (I would take him 3rd behind Siakam and Brown)"
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It‚Äôs one of the better drafts we‚Äôve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
I'd swap Dejounte Murray with Brogdon
"7th, behind Ingram, Jalen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Dejounte Murray, and Siakam, only one that debatable is Dejounte imo"
Philly would be better with Dejounte Murray running the PG.
"You definitely know better than I do, I thought Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and to a lesser extent, Lonnie Walker and Dejounte Murray all don‚Äôt seem to have that much creation skills for themselves or for others (Dejounte‚Äôs passing probably being the most impactful of the bunch)"
"Take the western conference last year. How many starting PGs would you take ahead of Schroeder? Conley, Paul, Murray, Reggie Jackson, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, curry, Ball, Fox, dejounte Murray, Russell, John wall, and Maledon.  I see maybe 2 I‚Äôd take after him. That‚Äôs pretty bad lol. He‚Äôs not v good. He‚Äôs a sixth man."
"Dejounte has 3 years left on his deal and the only players that aren't on their rookie or minimum contracts are Poeltl, White, Murray and now Collins and McDermott. It really isn't all that bad"
Dejounte Murray gon be a star
Dejounte Murray grew up in a really bad situation as well.
What's the plan with Dejounte? Poetl/Murray for Turner? It's hard to gauge value on him. I'm honestly not sure if that would even be worth it.  I kind of feel like Indiana and Portland might make good trade partners... But apparently they don't want to move Mccollum now so who knows wtf they are doing.
"&gt;I‚Äôd say anywhere from 15-17 is a good amount for a player of his caliber  That puts him in the exact same range as Dejounte Murray, which is really where he sits."
"They have good talent for where they‚Äôve drafted the past 10 years. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson were all pick 29. You don‚Äôt get starting caliber players that consistently late in the draft unless you‚Äôre good at evaluating and developing talent like the spurs"
Didn‚Äôt Dejounte Murray do that?
"The ability to draw fouls intentionally, consistently. That seems to be the deciding factor for whether or not a player becomes a superstar. Dejounte murray for example if he could draw fouls like butler, harden, or trae young then he genuinely might average 25/7/5 next season. It gives and extra dimension to a players offenee and opens up the ones that already existed."
Dejounte Murray maybe.
I think he and Beal would compliment each other very nicely. That said outside of Rui I have no idea why you‚Äôd be interested in those other pieces for him. And I‚Äôm pretty sure management has no interest in moving Rui as along with being a promising young player he‚Äôs a marketing machine. Much rather see them pursue including Kuzma in a package for someone like Dejounte Murray than waste time with this. Though I would love Siakam here
"I mean.. dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson were both 29. Derrick white too.   You can put quotes around ""contributing players"" but I think you'll have a hard time arguing that those 3 guys don't contribute."
Yes. Kawhi Leonard at 15 - incredible pick. Kyle Anderson at 30 - great pick. Dejounte Murray at 29 - great pick. Derrick White at 29 - great pick. Keldon Johnson at 29 - great pick. We drafted an MVP caliber player and 4 starter level players while having no lottery picks until last year.
"Yeah I really like the Jrue Holiday comparison for him. Hopefully a decent enough shooter but not a flamethrower, smart player who can run an offense if needed but probably works best as a secondary ball-handler, and an absolute terror at both guard spots on defense. Dejounte Murray also comes to mind."
"2019 29th pick Keldon Johnson  2017 29th pick Derrick White  2016 29th pick Dejounte Murray  2014 30th pick Kyle Anderson  These are all picks within the last decade that are solid role players for any team. All picked late first round, which is more than what some teams hope to get at that spot. Maybe I'm wrong and Primo becomes a bust, but their track record has been pretty good imo"
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
Kuzma for dejounte Murray or something..... we have  Aaron holiday as our only pg...
Dejounte Murray doesn't seem to agree :(
Dejounte Murray is so obsessed with himself it‚Äôs to a level where it‚Äôs impressive  The guy looked at a camera and did the Vanessa Hudgens snarl
Dejounte Murray sends tweets like that out regularly and they almost never have anything to do with basketball. He‚Äôs a Twitter diva.
"Yes yes front office  we have Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Patty Mills as our guards so lets take ANOTHER ONE"
Derrick White and Dejounte Murray are dope though
"Dejounte Murray, Derrick white, two firsts"
"i realize Jrue Holiday and getting off Bledsoe warranted five picks, but Daryl's crazy if he thinks any other team is ""one Ben Simmons away"" from resigning a Giannis-esque player and winning a chip lol there is zero chance if the asking price remains SEVEN picks and a DeJounte Murray or Derrick White level player."
I hear you can have Ben for the low low price of all your draft capital and Dejounte Murray!!!!!
"He is a negative contract?    His flaws in the playoffs relegate him to role player status?     I'd also rather take Dejounte Murray, FVV, and Haliburton on my team over Simmons?"

"Ok you're right, I wish my team was building around Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray"
So just Dejounte Murray?
Dejounte Murray burner?
"He‚Äôs a poor man‚Äôs Dejounte Murray. Inefficient scorer who doesn‚Äôt space the floor, ok passer, great defender and hustle guy"
I don't think any trade for him makes sense for both teams. I might consider trading Derrick White but Ben Simmons would be a bad fit next to Murray. I would consider trading Dejounte but he has stepped up as the clear leader of the team and makes significant improvements every offseason. Zero chance I would trade both Dejounte and Derrick for him.  I'd consider trading Keldon and this year's first I guess but there's no trade that makes sense for both teams imo.

"OG is definitely a better all round defender, long overdue for an all defensive selection although there always seems to be something random impacting his selection be it injury or media profile preferring more famous guys. I'm not arguing otherwise. I would say that i'd much prefer Thybulle to guard 1s and 2s over screens when the center is in drop coverage. Yes this is a very specific set of circumstances but its very common to see drop coverage these days and guys who can get over those screens and get back to the the guards are extremely valuable. OG is a very good screen navigator for a guy as big as he is but there are certain limitations to his body type, the same going for guys like Lebron and Kawhi these days. Amazing players for switch all schemes though.  &gt;If you read the second part of that sentence. You‚Äôd see that I said the next 50 is much more skewed to bench players. That‚Äôs around 35  I still don't really get this. Thybulle guarded the primary ball handler most of the time he was on the court, except for very specific matchups (Dame/Luka/Russ/Donovan) where Thybulle was either not playing or Philly had very specific schemes for those players which warranted the use of Ben in those matchups (for what its worth Clarkson was always more of a threat vs the 6ers than Donovan).  The Sixers played plenty of  games without Simmons (14), and those were the games where people really got to see the most out of Thybulle. Conditioning has never been an issue with him, its only his offence that limits his minutes (and foul trouble in his first year), he had plenty of games with +30 minutes played and never struggled with the load.  Joel was really good defensively this year but we also played a scheme that lets guards run wild quite a bit, Phoenix had a huge mix of coverages that were usually a lot more aggressive on ball, be it with or without Aayton. You also may want to check your facts. [Aayton was definitely closing in the majority of games](https://go.nba.com/air3).  I really don't understand what you're trying to prove here. Thybulle played amazing defence vs a whole range of guards, from all stars to bench spark plugs. He was also a wizard in the passing lanes and put had jump shooters fearing him because he can pop out of nowhere and block shots when players least expected it. The success of Philly's drop coverage schemes hinged on Dwight and Embiid not having to hedge high because Simmons/Thybulle both were fanstastic POA defenders.  Defensive teams are weird to pick because there's only 10 spots for 30 teams and realistically most teams have a few people contributing to make them successful on that end, not just 1 guy (sorry Rudy). It's very rare that 2 guards make it from one team, especially since we had multiple contributors, but its not impossible, and Matisse was clearly deserving of consideration. Whether or not he should have made it is open for debate but it wasn't some legacy selection like Kobe used to get, he's a legitimate all defensive caliber guy playing in an era thats made it harder and harder to guard aggressively through screens like he has to do. Dejounte Murray made the team playing 21 minutes a game in 2018 *because he was an outstanding defender* and Matisse just happens to fit that same mould."
Every dude under 24 that puts up stats is a future perennial all nba player. Haliburton is this off seasons future superstar.    Anybody remember when Herro was untradable on his sub 8 months ago? Markannen a year before that? Dejounte Murray before that?
"Pop is still elite. He‚Äôs just playing with a roster whose best players are DeMar Derozan and Dejounte Murray. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good you are as a coach, you just can‚Äôt turn every single roster into a contender."
This would have to coincide with a trade for Dejounte Murray or something but we don't have the assets to do two of these trades
I feel like I see more and more blame going to coaches than ever before. Every single time the Bucks would lose a game it was because Bud was the worst coach in the league and every time they won it was in spite of his shitty coaching.   I‚Äôve seen people say Pop isn‚Äôt good anymore because the Spurs haven‚Äôt played well the past two years as if two of his three best players aren‚Äôt Dejounte Murray and Derrick White. Like a different coach would take the Spurs roster to the 5th seed.
"Jamal Crawford's ProAm league he hosts in Seattle. A lot of Seattle/Washington-based players like to go there like Isaiah Thomas, Zach Lavine, etc which brings in non-Seattle/Washington-based players like Poole. There was even a game between KPJ and Dejounte Murray there yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9hDy7cgAAs"
"30-45 wins purgatory. We have enough talent to not be terrible but not enough to be more than a 7th seed at best. My prediction is 38 wins and the 9th seed in the west but it's really up to how Dejounte Murray, Keldon and co develop"
Dejounte Murray is going to have a breakout season.
"Jarret Allen, Bradley Beal, Middleton, Durant, LaVine, Seth Curry, Kevin Huerter, DeJounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young.   I would be running a ton."
KPJ  De‚Äôandre Hunter  RJ Hampton  JJJ  Dejounte Murray
But do you *simp* for Dejounte Murray?
"With DeRozan leaving, Dejounte Murray will emerge as a two way star"
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don‚Äôt really count it."
Someone who I think everyone is sleeping on is Dejounte Murray.
Dejounte Murray
Rondo did a lot in the past. Dejounte Murray gets a full on steal and breakaway dunk at least once every other game
"Gary harris, thybulle, prime wall, dejounte murray, rondo"
"Dejounte Murray, he‚Äôs actually like really good at it too"
"Getting Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson at the 29th pick is incredible. In a redraft all those guys go in the lottery."
"I really like what I see out of KJ in the Olympics and think he will develop into a very good starting player.  Derrick White is a very solid player.  DeJounte Murray looks like he can become an all star player based on his improvements every year. Will it happen? Who knows for sure but there is reason to believe it can with his talent. His defense is so good.  Lonnie Walker is promising, Poetl is VERY underrated great Rim protector.  The 12th pick is not a spot where you are likely to add a game changer even in this pretty deep draft. The Suns for example added Mikal Bridges around this pick when they were rebuilding and he has helped them improve. Then all it took was CP3 coming \[and Booker/Ayton developing\] to turn them into a huge winner.  Spurs if they drafted Duarte he can be really good then imagine this team:  Murray PG White SG Duarte G/F Keldon F Poetl C  Vassell, Walker, Samanic, Eubanks \[young but solid\]  that team will win 30-35 games in the West and be in lottery. In East would have made play in games and push for 8th seed.  Maybe you get better luck and win lottery? Maybe you package a bunch of good players for 1 great player? Maybe you finally sign a big time free agent in 2022 by paying the most? Spurs will have the most cap room that summer.  I don't think this is the year to go crazy. I say draft Duarte, let the Vets walk, get into the lottery and plan to start signing players in summer 2022. This is probably Pop last season he needs like 25 wins to be most all time so celebrate that and then rebuild next season with a new coach and go looking for a superstar."
"As a Celtics fan, I would prefer Dejounte Murray but if we can swing a deal for Brogdon and not lose out on assets I‚Äôd be happy with that. I think we keep onto the flexibility to try to land a guy like Beal when he becomes available though"
Please no if you can't fit in and be a solid role player next to Steph fucking Curry I have no hope you'll be good next to Dejounte Murray
"Oh yeah great shout, forgot about him. Dejounte Murray too. Might be forgetting someone else but that‚Äôs probably your top 5 along with Simmons who may or may not be a guard in the near future."

"It was after both Tim and Manu had retired, and the Spurs had shifted focus to making Dejounte Murray the de facto  starter.  I was disappointed that Tony didn't stay a Spurs lifer, even if that meant taking a backseat and coming off the bench...but he wanted a bigger role.  The irony is that Charlotte team was awful. Tony only played 56 games and didn't start a single one. If he could do it over again, I imagine he would do things differently."

He has the biggest scoring jump (outside of Bridges) and other than Herro, is the only other candidate who has improve his efficiency while doing so. Considering how hugely different the counting stats are, I still give an edge to Miles Bridges, but Ja is second to me, with Herro and Poole right there."
"I mean why not include Derrick White or Dejounte Murray who were both 1st round picks?  Both barely played as rookie.  You really said, ‚ÄúPop is effectively stunting his rookies out of valuable playing time‚Äù, and your wondering why you come off as biased?"
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.   He‚Äôll bounce back
"Derrick White played 17 games his rookie year dude. Dejounte Murray 38 games. The two of them would have actually dragged the averages down since it dilutes Devin Vassell's contribution to it.  I didn't add them since it makes sense why San Antonio didn't play them, they were contenders or at least a playoff team."
"Ok being a middle tier team still means you don‚Äôt have the opportunity to draft great talent.  Like if we‚Äôre doing a redraft how much do they regret Keldon Johnson at 29?  Vassell just turned 21 and looks good.  Dejounte Murray looks great. The Lonnie Walker pick hasn‚Äôt looked great but I‚Äôm sure Spurs fans aren‚Äôt too down for missing on Huerter or Okogie.  Weird way to frame things, OP, almost seems like you have an agenda ü§î.  Edit: Keldon Johnson autocorrect"
"Very convenient to cut it off just before Derrick White and Dejounte Murray, who have been significant contributors who were picked at 29th.  And idk why you are extrapolating for Primo. The Spurs always send their picks to the G league for a year. He's never going to play much this year."
Dejounte Murray is approaching all star level.
Lonnie walker + Thad Young + Dejounte Murray starting to look a lot better eh?
Best: Dejounte Murray  Worst: Shooting

"Lol. If Dallas offered Luka to Spurs for Dejounte Murray straight up, every sane person on the Spurs organisation would pull the trigger"
Luka is overrated. I‚Äôd rather Dejounte Murray than him tbh. DJM is a much better defender.
I sincerely apologize to all Spurs fans for ever floating a Ben Simmons for Dejounte Murray swap.
Dejounte Murray is the most underrated players in the league?  He‚Äôs more than 1??
"Magic commentators in the entire 2nd quarter be like   ""Hey did you know what picks were used to draft Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray?""  [Twenty Nine](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/ee/New_Student_Starfish_087.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190822081634)"
Dejounte Murray is one of the most underrated players in the league

"We‚Äôre talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
"Yeah, I'm not worried. Yeah losing consecutive close games hurts, but if our games are close each time, it means our talent is there, we just need to learn how to close out.   Dejounte Murray is starting to get into a groove, and I'm hoping the rest of the team can start to find their stride. Our guys were not high tier picks but we've made decent starters out of them. Spurs' scouts and development are top notch."
He was hyped as an elite defensive player so I‚Äôm confused what the backlash is  There‚Äôs a lot of elite defensive guards like Jrue Ben Dejounte Murray etc
"Yea just responded to another guy but I agree, if he‚Äôs considered a guard he‚Äôs better. Like I said in the post GPII is more limited in that he really only excels at guarding ball handlers, where guys like Thybulle, Holiday, and Dejounte Murray to an extent have more defensive versatility (and for Murray and especially Holiday more offensive game). Maybe if Lowe had said best at guarding point guards it would‚Äôve been a more measured take"
Dejounte Murray for players that can actually exist on offense
"Dejounte Murray should be up in the discussion, he's so good"

You want to trade Tatum for Dejounte Murray?? Please consider being a fan of one of the other 29 teams lol
"Is there any universe where this goes through?   Warriors get:  * Dejounte Murray   * Jakob Poeltl   Spurs get:  * Jordan Poole  * James Wiseman  * Jon Kuminga   * Moses Moody  The Warriors get two fantastic players for their youth. Spurs get an injection of young talent. I know the Spurs want to try to compete while Pop is around, but is this a good trade on paper in your opinion?"
Dejounte Murray comes to mind.
I‚Äôm not saying they desperately need to be traded but if they can get a solid 2 way playmaking PG like Ben Simmons or Dejounte Murray and a defensive big that can shoot I‚Äôd take that deal like Tingus Pingus
Dejounte Murray is playing like a star this year
"Fuck that noise. Fuck tanking. I'm looking forward to Dejounte Murray playing out his skin while blaming himself for ever loss.  I'm looking forward to the fans blaming Pops roattions for each close loss while begging he won't retire, that he wins enough to get the record, but we lose enough to get the lottery.  I'm looking forward to Primo.  I'm looking forward to White grtting back to form and showing everyone what a big balled stud he is.  I'm looking forward to Forbes scoring 40 pts one night, and 2 pts the next.  I'm looking forward to each Poetle jam.  I'm looking forward to the day Keldon kills a man jus to watch him die.  I'm looking forward to tomora vs Mavs (gonna smash em).  There's too much to love bout this team, regardless of current potential, to sit and wait for the chance of a draft pick. Nothing good in NBA comes from waiting. Some teams have been waiting for decades. Fuck that. These kids want to win. They believe in themselves, the fans owe it to show them the same."
"The Spurs are who we thought they were. Scrappy athletic team that can‚Äôt really hit outside shots, pressure the ball and force turnovers, and show occasional flashes from young guys. Keldon has cooled off a ton after a hot start, same with Lonnie. Dejounte Murray took another leap like he does every season and looks like he could end up being a top 3 guy on a contender."
"Well Dejounte Murray is very good and our savior, that's our direction I think  Also Chet/Paolo"
If things keep going downhill...is Dejounte Murray on the table for Ben Simmons? I'm just not sure if the Spurs would ever commit to a tank.

DeMar was genuinely all-star level in the western conference last season. Should've made it in over Conley. Elite closer and one of the most efficient playmakers in the league. And that was on a team with Poeltl at center and Dejounte Murray next to him at guard. Now DeMar has all the spacing in the world.

"I don't mean to toot our own horn too much, but this makes what the Spurs have done even more exceptional.   Obviously you have huge success stories like Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili....but even in the last 10-ish years we've pulled guys like George Hill, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Tre Jones, etc...out of the late first to second rounds, or even undrafted.  Our last three lottery picks were Kawhi (15th), Devin Vassell (14th), and Josh Primo (12th).   Kawhi is obviously Kawhi, Vassell is looking great in his 2nd year, and Primo shows all the signs of a young star in the making.   Sure, we've had some whiffs like Luka Samanic, but that is a lot of success stories coming that late in the draft."
"Ah oops, two Murray's.  I meant Dejounte Murray.  Spurs.  Denver's Murray is still on an uncertain timeline"
"They turn into high level starters and all-stars for the Spurs and Raptors. See Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Kelvin Johnson, Siakam, FVV, Norman Powell."
Dejounte Murray is putting up 18/8/8 and 2+ steals a game so far this year and he‚Äôs not even played that well. He could flirt with a 20/10/10 this year.
"if he's 75% for his career that'll probably hold up. He's taken like 400+ free throws. How is that not solid.   Also, I never said his FT% is elite. An offensive possession where Dejounte Murray gets to the free throw line would have an expected value of 1.5 points. That means that him going to the free throw line is a good possession. He doesn't need to stop taking free throws, he needs to get better at them. He's not great at them yet, but he's nowhere near bad enough that he should not try to get to the line more. That's crazy talk.   Also, it's not like FTs are the only value gained from drawing free throws. You also put a foul on the opposing player, which is good. It's unbelievably baffling to say that a 75% free throw shooter should not try to draw fouls more because he's 2% worse than league average at them for his career."
Dejounte Murray close to averaging a Triple Double (17.5/8.5/8.8). Tyler Herro averaging 22z

Dejounte Murray makes me irrationally happy.
holy fuck DeJounte Murray takeover
"In fact Lowry this season as a lot in common with dejounte murray. Dejounte has easily been our mvp. He‚Äôs clamping up opposing guards while being the heart of our offence due to his playmaking and shot creation. He‚Äôs been an impactful and good player.   That doesn‚Äôt mean his scoring doesn‚Äôt matter. His scoring has been a mess like Lowry‚Äôs. And that can‚Äôt just be ignored. It‚Äôs a large part of the game regardless of the other places they‚Äôre impacting, especially when it‚Äôs not just production but efficiency too"
"I love Dejounte‚Äôs game, he‚Äôs one of my favorite players in the league.  This is actually a pretty good observation, OP. It‚Äôs a shame that the whole triple double discussion is so polarizing - I am guilty of being down on it at times myself.    This is because a lot of the narrative has been that getting triple doubles is a skillset that Westbrook simply possesses. It dismisses multiple other stats and fundamental team principles, which were essential for him to average those numbers. I‚Äôd argue there is enough evidence to show that Westbrook set out to TRY and get triple doubles and prioritized it. He ran a stagnant offence where he was definitely able to create opportunities around the rim by driving and dishing, but also sacrificed free ball movement to increase the chance of an assist. The stats show that while in OKC, he was top 1-3 in touches per game and top 1-2 in time spent on ball, while OKC were 30th in passing. Similarly, we know that he spent one season with fewer 3-point close outs that DeAndre Jordan, had low box out rates, and had pretty high uncontested rebound %‚Äôs. I think the triple doubles are impressive and he‚Äôs an amazing talent, but we need to consider the broader context of how he averaged those numbers. You can‚Äôt do that without ‚Äúhating‚Äù unfortunately.    With Dejounte, there are some interesting differences. He‚Äôs averaging almost 9 assists as a point guard in a San Antonio system which is 5th in team passing. Murray is outside the top 10 in terms of time spent on the ball and touches. 85% of his rebounds are currently uncontested though so while 9.2 rebounds is high for a guard, only 1.4 of them are contested.    Anyway, it‚Äôs early in the season - I think this is a good early observation"
"I love Dejounte Murray with a passion. But I‚Äôd say the chances are very low. If Lebron hasn‚Äôt done it, then Murray isn‚Äôt gonna do it.   I think the more interesting question is whether he can ever get a Quadruple Double in a game. He‚Äôs gotten 8 steals before. So it‚Äôs not impossible for him to get a quadruple double.  Other than him, Giannis is the only one I can think of that of that could probably do it. Jokic, Westbrook, Lebron, and Luka don‚Äôt play defense like that. But maybe I‚Äôm missing someone."
"He's boxing out for DeJounte Murray who is averaging 8.2 defensive boards, he's doing what Steven Adams did for Westbrook  Anyway they get useless rebounds mostly to pad the stats for star the point guard"
