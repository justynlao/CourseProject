Make it Tatum and we‚Äôll even throw in NBA three point shooting leader Gorgui Dieng
"I was looking for our last one and was shocked to find that Ben McLemore won it in November 2013. Then I saw that the other Western Conference winners for that season were Trey Burke (3x), Nick Calathes, and Gorgui Dieng and that kind of explains things.  Prior to that was Tyreke Evans (2x) in 2009. Boogie didn't win any the next year because Blake Griffin swept all the months. And that's it for Sacramento Kings winners."
"He even hit one as a trailer on the wing while still moving last night. The second I saw him slow down I knew he was gonna hit it, which isn‚Äôt something I thought I was going to be saying about Gorgui Dieng before this season."

Gorgui Dieng
"Beasley can be in the list but he isn't the winner. i think everyone knew he could score pretty efficiently, it was more a matter of usage rate. he didn't get on the court enough with the nuggets and he was hurt  other times. grant always looked good against my team, but I thought he was like gorgui dieng, a role player that turns into a star whenever I see him. lol Jerami has to be tied with wood as the leaders. that said wood was a beast any time he played at all going back to the pelicans so even he is less surprising to me than Jerami grant honestly."
"Gorgui Dieng has been pretty excellent whenever JV hasn‚Äôt been able to play and is on an expiring. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if any of the competing teams lacking front court depth at least inquire on his availability  JV himself could get traded too, but Dieng seems like almost a given to be on the move"
"You‚Äôre right it took some more moving but after some time consuming math I‚Äôve figured out an easily completed plan.  They were $3.5m over the cap entering FA with 9 roster spots filled. Teague and Gorgui Dieng were on expirings with $19m and $16.2m respectively. The Timberwolves just needed to trade Teague and waive and stretch Dieng for a season. This clears $27.1m. Then trading Covington into a team‚Äôs cap space clears an additional $11.3m.  This leaves the Wolves with $34.9m in cap space and 6 roster spots filled. Due to CBA rules, each empty roster spot below 14 spots takes up a rookie minimum salary as a place holder. In 2019-20, that figure was $898k which means the Wolves would have had $28.6m to sign D-Lo with. The max contract he could demand was for $27.3m which means the Wolves could sign him and have $1.3m to spare."

"Thibs decided to pick Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick over John Collins and OG Anunoby when the Wolves already had KAT and Gorgui Dieng (who was being paid $16 million a year, a contract he also handed out) at center."
"What contracts are you using to match salary? I was trying to find a way for Memphis to send Gorgui Dieng to the Raptors, and it takes like 3-5 dudes to match salaries. Drummond makes like 11 million more than Dieng, I don't even know if a deal is feasible."
The trebuchet goes to Gorgui Dieng
"but think of the marketing/branding opportunities with Beale/Beal Street!   Dillon Brooks, Gorgui Dieng, a signed marko guduric jersey, a top 29 protected second round pick, and we‚Äôll name one of the ducks at the peabody Agent 0  but in all seriousness, can we please get one league leading scorer please without giving up ja or jjj üôè"
I‚Äôd prefer Gorgui Dieng if Dieng got bought out
nico mannion makes kevin heurter look like gorgui dieng
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
We're probably looking to move Gorgui Dieng or Valanciunas.
KAT and D'lo.  Malik and Court Dates  Josh Okogie and Gorgui Dieng was one also before Dieng got traded.
"I feel like gorgui dieng will get bought out, maybe javale but someone will send some picks for him"
Gorgui Dieng type beat can‚Äôt wait
"Anytime you can jump out of your shoes to contest a Gorgui Dieng jumpshot, you HAVE to do it."
"He had roster control .  Imagine offering Shabazz Muhammad 44 million.  Imagine paying gorgui dieng 64 mil, imagine paying jeff teague 63 mil.  For example"
"He‚Äôs the second oldest. Gorgui Dieng is our oldest player at 30 (well, he turns 31 tomorrow).  Last year our vets were JV, SloMo, Jae, and Solo. This year we‚Äôre running with Gorgui, JV, and SloMo. Out side of that, we have Tayshaun Prince, Tony Allen, and Z-Bo is executive/consulting roles and they mentor the guys.  And we‚Äôve welcomed our players‚Äô parents as well. Normally we have our rookies living in team owned housing as we try to teach them how to manage their finances and such. Jaren Jackson Sr. and Tee Morant both have professional experience and keep their sons (and some of the other rookies) on the right path.  All of this is to say, the Grizz give their young‚Äôs guys plenty of rope to do what they do, but not enough to hand themselves."
I thought Gorgui Dieng was the original trebuchet
"FREEZE!  This is the Raptors Nickname police. You're in violation of Article 25, Chris Treboucher. This is your final warning to hand over all unauthorized use of the Trebuchet as a nickname for players not named Chris Boucher (specific exemption for the subject Gorgui Dieng under Article 25, Exemption ""OG""), not wearing the number 25 and not originating from Montreal, QC.  STOP RESISTING!"
Gorgui Dieng maybe?
"Grizz will likely make Gorgui Dieng available to trade closer to the deadline, as will other depth bigs. Nets might be able to work out a three team deal to obtain a Big."
Didn‚Äôt you know? Bismack Biyombo and Gorgui Dieng are top ten players in the league
"DeRozan and Butler is a pretty awful pairing given the ball dominance and lack of shooting (also, what‚Äôs the source of this rumor?).   He drafted Dunn over Murray and Hield, Justin Patton over OG and John Collins, and signed Gorgui Dieng, Cole Aldrich, and Jeff Teague to big free agent deals.  Not to mention he butted heads with literally everyone in the organization. Dude isn‚Äôt a bad coach, but he was bad in Minnesota. Maybe he learned. Maybe not. We‚Äôll have to see how things look in a season or two."
"He gets quite good looks though, always saw Gorgui Dieng with late close outs today"
I just switched to this game and the first thing I see is a Gorgui Dieng fadeaway jumper. That‚Äôs enough for me
Randomly stopped in the 200s and saw he had Gorgui Dieng 1 spot higher than Keldon Johnson and that bothered me quite a bit
GORGUI DIENG IS A BALLER
Gorgui Dieng.
"DR Congo has Mudiay and Biyombo, and Senegal has probably the worst trio in Gorgui Dieng, Tacko Fall and Georges Niang."
"Memphis for Dillon Brooks, Gorgui Dieng, + 1st"
Put in Gorgui Dieng cowards
"Grizzlies payroll in general is pretty good. Next year, they should have around $10 million in cap space, and the only player on an expiring deal is Gorgui Dieng. In 2022/23, they'll have Dillon Brooks, Ja Morant, Melton, Brandon Clarke, John Konchar, Desmond Bane, Jontay Porter, and Xavier Tillman signed. For a combined $45 million.   A lot of that unused cap space will probably be used to re-sign dudes like JJJ, Winslow, Tyus Jones, etc. But I feel like that's a pretty good group of players to have for relatively cheap."
I will not stand for Gorgui Dieng erasure
Gorgui dieng gets called for it every single time
Would you settle for Gorgui Dieng?
Gorgui Dieng
"First take I swore it said Gorgui Dieng, who the fuck let that man shoot from three and yet he made all of them!!. Jazz Player dev is on par with Spurs and Heat."
This is Gorgui Dieng erasure and I will not stand for it!
"Maybe? *Maybe?*  Jesus, the contracts he gave out were so heinous. Tried to give Bazz 4/40, we lucked out that he freaking rejected it. The Gorgui Dieng contract too. Ugh.  Also that last suggestion wasn‚Äôt an option. It was both roles or nothing for him."
"KG is their entire history. If you look at Basketball Ref. their ‚ÄúTop 12 Players All Time‚Äù includes Gorgui Dieng (and like 4 other guys I had never heard of [or, more likely, forgotten entirely])"
"Definitely the Kings. Edwards is ROTY candidate, Lavine is an All-Star level player, KAT is an All-NBA level player, Gorgui Dieng/Kris Dunn/Markkanen/Culver/Okogie all are or look like they can be role players. By contrast, three of the Kings' picks aren't even in the league anymore, and McLemore was out too until the Rockets revitalized him."
"I mean tbf to both Rosas and Thibs, Glen Taylor is known to have interfered A LOT.  Thibs tried to trade Wiggins for Butler but Glen nixed it and gave him a max instead. And Rosas supposedly was forced to keep Saunders.  That doesnt change the fact that there have been failures from the FO i.e. Gorgui Dieng on $16m a year and trading up for Culver when we could have had Clarke, Washington or Herro at 12"
"Burke wasn't traded for Donovan, Trey Lyle's was.  The Burke deal was actually one of our worst.  We had two later first round picks and traded them to get Burke, they ended up with Shabazz Muhammad and Gorgui Dieng.  But all the talk in that draft was how Shr√µder wanted to play for us.  We could've had him or Giannis. and not bothered with burke at all.  Now to be fair, same draft we bought back the Rudy rights.  I love him, and he's been great, but dennis lindsay ain't perfect, unless you really like azubuike too."
"Also, FUCK me, Gorgui Dieng on 17.2 million. What was u doin TWolves?"
"Out of curiosity, what makes it so bad? Is it mostly the Norman Powell thing? If so, how do you feel about Gorgui Dieng? He's basically doing the same things as Baynes, but he actually makes his 3s (and he's coming off the bench, unlike Baynes).   A package of Baynes, McCaw, and any two bench players makes the money work, do you think that's fair value? What if you threw in a second or two? It would allow you to get off Baynes' contract a year early, and Gorgui would improve your team imo. Grizzlies have some cap flexibility for the next few years, and a logjam in the frontcourt, so I think this trade could work for both teams."
get Gorgui Dieng or a Khem Birch type. This big man rotation is not going to cut it. KP is good on the help side.
"The crazy thing is that Towns is already sixth in career minutes in Wolves history (and he passed Wiggins for this record who was third in career minutes which is even more absurd). The wolves just have been such a garbage organization that we have constant high turnover from top to bottom so no one ever really sticks around long enough to make impressive numbers. KG is the obvious exception (he has 36,189 minutes while second place has only 18,394 minutes) so he dominated all the records. KG had second place at least doubled in the five main categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) until Rubio late in his first stint got enough assists and steals, and he still isn't going to pass KG in either category. And Towns isn't even halfway to KG on points or rebounds. This is one of the only records someone could take from KG just because it's the one thing he didn't really do.  Our recordbook is really the saddest probably in all of sports when you dig a little deeper than what KG makes it seem at first glance. For instance, look at how much Gorgui Dieng makes the list. He was here 6.5 seasons and mostly a backup C, but did start out of position at the 4 one of those seasons. He is 4th in games played, 9th in minutes, 3rd in blocks, 7th in steals (lol), 4th in rebounds. If you ever wanted an argument for why Glen Taylor is the worst owner in the NBA, look no further than our top 10 records."
Gorgui Dieng would be a good center for the nets to get to replace for DeAndre if they had anything to trade for him
for players that the Nets may target?  * Javale McGee * Nerlens * PJ Tucker * LaMarcus Aldridge (longshot) * Blake Griffin (prob won't opt out) * Gorgui Dieng * Robin Lopez (most likely)
bizmack biyombo and cody zeller against valencinuas and gorgui dieng seems less than ideal.
"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
Gorgui Dieng is prob gonna be moved to a team that needs front court depth.
"Deni is 20 years old and has a Gorani Muslim father. He's not the one pulling the trigger, and he was never even in the IDF by virtue of Israel's mandatory service laws (he got an exemption because of basketball).  Furthermore, Holocaust Remembrance Day is important to *all* Jews the world over. Avdija is the only Jewish NBA player I am aware of, and trying to tie his remembrance to crimes currently being committed in a country where most of the world's Jews don't even life is *very* antisemitic.  Nobody tries to claim that Furkan Korkmaz bears responsibility for the Turkish invasion of Northern Syria, or that Gorgui Dieng needs to answer for the actions of Islamic terror groups. So unless Deni starts publicly speaking in support of Israel's occupation, why does Deni need to answer for their actions? Deni may be Israeli, but here, Israel is irrelevant to the conversation."
Just a friendly (salty) reminder that Thomas Joseph Thibodeau chose to draft center Justin Patton with Karl Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng under contract (then signed Taj Gibson to a 2/$28m contract less than 2 weeks later) over guys like John Collins and **OG Anunoby**.
Spurs should be running the offense through Gorgui Dieng.  Pathetic misuse of one of their top players.
"That takes into account the last 3 years, so basically the last 2 playoffs for Harrell.  Whilst I'm sure his grandmother's death affected him, it's more about his skillset and that skillset not being conducive to the playoffs.   That guy who tweeted what I originally posted is the BBALL Index founder and Lakers fan, and what he said is on point, bigs who are post scorers on offense or anchor bigs on defense have a lot less value in the playoffs.   Conversely, bigs that are stretch bigs on offense or mobile bigs on defense, have a lot more value in the playoffs.  Think about it logically, it makes sense. It's why somebody like Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson (god damn it Danny Ainge), Drummond, Harrell etc. aren't valuable in the playoffs, whereas bigs like Ibaka, Gorgui Dieng are what everybody wants.   Celtics played Theis over Kanter in the playoffs for most of last season. Raptors were dominant whenever they played Ibaka in the playoffs last season, but thankfully they didn't play him enough minutes, and we high PnRed Gasol to death when he was out there and exploited him."
I need to see Gorgui Dieng play. I thought he was the best big
Gorgui Dieng was waived by the Wolves and signed with another small market (the Spurs).
Dieng it! Feel better Gorgui
"I agree.  Ultimately, you can't make people want to live certain places. The clippers sucked forever. The Knicks are barely a playoff team.  People just don't like good teams getting buyout players that are good, but no one is butt hurt about Gorgui Dieng."
Lol yo we're bad enough that you don't need to hide that we traded Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad AND Gorgui Dieng (the best player of the three.)
I'm going with Gorgui Dieng
"Gorgui Dieng is much better than both of these guys at this point and he signed with the Spurs, so I reject this concept."
"People not watching games are showing themsevles, Griffin, Aldridge, Drummond just aren't that good, if they were they would've been traded not in the buy out market.  It's flat out not impossible that Gorgui Dieng is better than all 3, and he went to a lower end playoff team, it's not impossible that Markieff Morris provided more in last playoffs then those 3 provide this year and nobody cares about Kieff last year.  Free agents mostly already take pay cut/force trades to the ""richer"", if you wanna say that part is a problem, but please don't use a player that can't move, a player that was getting outplayed by Drew Eubanks and a center with a 50%TS who got traded for John Henson and Brandon Knight one year ago to act like the buy out market is suddenly unfair"
"&gt; I'm just saying in comparison to LMA and Drummond.   That's because these are the type of players that the teams needed. If LMA and Drummond weren't bought out, they would have looked for other big men. That could have been a Demarcus Cousins or Gorgui Dieng or Meyers Leonard. Similarly, Jeremy Lin was the best available PG available at the time.   The buyout market is more based on luck than anything else. The only reason why Drummond and LMA got bought out was because there wasn't a suitor for them or the asking price was too high. Javale for example got moved to Nuggets BECAUSE he had a decent contract and Nuggets had a need for a backup big  &gt; But I do appreciate teams that get their players legitimately.   Did the Nets not get their players legitimately? They gave up good young players, are WAY over the salary cap and essentially their future for the next 7 years for Harden. It's likely that their big 3 will retire before half of these picks convey. If sixers were willing to do the same, they would have gotten Harden too"
"Gorgui Dieng has been the best player on the buyout market right now and he quietly went to the Spurs because he doesn't have name recognition like these other washed up vets. Has anyone watched Aldridge recently? Blake clearly has lost a few steps even when he's trying. I don't think the buyout rules are that bad, these guys are bought out for a reason. (Case can be made for Drummond being the best on the market but that's only if he decides to not be a black hole on offense, which I'm not convinced on)"
Yes lmao the Nets should have signed Gorgui Dieng smh he is so much better than Blake and LMA. He can shoot the 3 and isn't a complete defensive liability outside of the paint cause he's actually athletic enough to move.
"Probably like one guy who made an all-star team early in the league, and a few bench-warmers. Actually, isn't Gorgui Dieng technically British?"
"How can anyone hate Dieng? He's just an amazing individual and he is definitely an NBA level basketball player. He wasn't sitting on the bench because he couldn't play, we just wanted to maximize development time for the young guys.  All the love to Gorgui"
Gorgui Dieng would like to have a word with you
Well of course not. No one thinks signing gorgui dieng makes them a contender. Just a positive addition to the team
"Aside from Gorgui Dieng, I'm not sure there were too many players on the buyout market that really could have helped us. This does not stop me from worrying that the Nets and Bucks are getting them all though lol."
"But they don't, so you better hope Harden and KD choke before the Finals because Gorgui 'Trebuchet' Dieng will be right there waiting for them"
"Gorgui Dieng would have made the Nets better than this did but if we did none of yall would have said shit, lmao. You see a big name and a narrative you can run with and it‚Äôs fuck the actual basketball at that point. LMA and Blake are WASHED. It‚Äôs not that crazy. Yes, it‚Äôs a superteam, any hating directed at us on those grounds is expected, but acting like these signings is piling on a 4th and 5th all-star is casual af. These are mid-level roleplayers. Aldridge in particular is fully liable to just be complete ass and a mistake."
Gorgui Dieng is Hakeem Olajuwon if he couldn‚Äôt raise his arms
"Dwight's last ejection was him forcing Doc to play Reed, this ejection is to show Morey that he feels Gorgui Dieng was an amazing addition to the roster. Team Guy Dwight!"
Gorgui Dieng come up here
Bring me Gorgui fucking Dieng then man FUCK this shit.
Andre Drummond is not as good as gorgui dieng
I‚Äôd rather get Gorgui Dieng anyways so I‚Äôm not mad about it
Yes &amp; they about to get Gorgui Dieng too.
We can get gorgui dieng who‚Äôs better
"Realistic targets would be guys Avery Bradley, Wayne Ellington and Gorgui Dieng. Unrealistic would be guys like Drummond and Otto Porter jr, but still being targeted."
I hear Gorgui Dieng is now available.
How do you have Robin Lopez in there but not Gorgui Dieng?
Best explanation ever was Gorgui Dieng:   https://m.facebook.com/SportsCenter/videos/314290999198033/  &gt;I just want to swap Jerseys with him  Still love you Trebuchet.
The Grizzlies have Gorgui Dieng as a 17m TPE this trade deadline use it or lose it
KATs 2nd best player with most career WS is damn Gorgui Dieng.
Gorgui Dieng. Take it or leave it.
"I've never really understood why Perkins remains relevant in commentary. He's not a very great basketball mind, he was not a spectacular player, and he has hot takes but doesn't usually have anything of substance.  Similarity score wise, it would be like having Biedrins and Gorgui Dieng on commentary, and honestly that feels pretty accurate - he just happened to walk away with one ring"
"Probably someone who can shoot really well. Those days were so reliant on paint scoring and paint protectors that adding a guy who could score 3s on high volume at a 40% rate would be the best scorer in the league and open the floor for others. Maybe like Landry Shamet or something  edit: nvm I just realized you said 60s and I don't think the 3 pt line existed then? probably some really long/athletic big man then like Mo Bamba, bonus that you can shoot the jumper a bit. maybe Gorgui Dieng"
We already had Gorgui Dieng on the roster. His moves are an F because none of those players besides Okogie are still on the roster and he setback the franchise  5 years. But no use in talking to someone who doesn't actually follow the team.
Lakers woulda been better off signing gorgui Dieng he‚Äôs seriously better than Drummond too
"They had KAT and Buttler and some nice rotation prices. People gave him shit for not adapting to the modern game. Giving the bag to gorgui dieng for reasons, and always playing a non shooting power forward next to KAT. The man would have played 4 centres if he could in Minnesota."
Shooting 1/6 in the last 2 mins of regulation and OT against Gorgui Dieng? Absolutely
I‚Äôm surprised Gorgui Dieng isn‚Äôt getting minutes over Drew Eubanks. His defense is solid and can at least attempt a 3. I do like Eubanks though.
The comparisons are definitely there. Either Ja takes a leap or they fetch him another co-star(pending JJJs health) and I think they could get a top 2 seed. They‚Äôre legit so deep they casually waived gorgui dieng lol.
Gorgui Dieng would‚Äôve been nice for them but I don‚Äôt know that they really chose Aldridge over Dieng. Sounds like they pursued him.
1) Jordan Nwora - Bucks  2) Gorgui Dieng - Spurs  3) Ryan Arcidiacono - Bulls? (not sure if he was traded)  4) Keljin Blevins - not a clue  5) Tyrell Terry - not a clue  6) Brandon Goodwin - Hawks  7) Mo Wagner - Bulls  8) Oshae Brissett - Raptors?  9) Trent Forrest - Heat?  10) Wenyen Gabriel - Heat?
That's Bam. He's more like a poor man's Gorgui Dieng
nobody cared what happened in a 2018 Bulls - Wolves game. Gorgui Dieng probably shot like 10 midrangers that game too and nobody would have batted an eye.
"Marc Gasol, Jonas Valanciunas, Gorgui Dieng."
"I appreciate you taking the time to better understand my point, and while I do think Gobert had an amazing season, I think you are missing my big point that defensive stats don't tell the whole story *because* of the complexities of defense, not just because of small sample sizes.  All 5 of these stats concurrently saying he has had the best season is extremely impressive, but again defensive stats favor big men because perimeter and other defensive skills are not easily quantified. I checked a few of those stats and they are heavily big man oriented. Out of D-Lebron's top 50 seasons, only 2 were from perimeter players and it was Kawhi at 42 and 50, which is just nonsense. D Raptor has only existed since tracking data was introduced in 2013 so historical records for it are estimated, and while tracking data is better in theory compared to counting stats of their top 10 seasons since 2013, they had Gorgui Dieng in Memphis last year as #7 and as someone who watched that season I can definitely tell you that is complete bullshit.   Again, I just don't think using counting stats as a way to quantify defensive play is the end all be all because it consistently undervalues other important defensive skills that are very hard to track like help defense, switching/navigating screens, or on ball defense.   Gobert undoubtedly had an amazing defensive season and I think he's an elite defender and easily one of the best, if not the best in the league, I just think calling it the best ever is hyperbolic."
Coulda went after Gorgui Dieng tbh
"I think Gasol is better in the second unit, where his passing can actually be utilized when LeBron or X ball handling guard isn‚Äôt dominating the ball. I think a guy like Gorgui Dieng would be a guy I‚Äôd look at to start. I‚Äôm not sure how good he is defensively but he‚Äôll be cheap and that‚Äôs the sort of option we‚Äôll have to look at to solve our issues this off-season."
Gorgui Dieng?
Just like gorgui dieng.
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
Gorgui plays defense and rebounds on top of his .670 TS% and .185 WS/48 this year.    I genuinely don‚Äôt know why Dieng doesn‚Äôt get more minutes.  He‚Äôs a great backup center.
Less than gorgui dieng got
Somewhat surprised Gorgui Dieng isn‚Äôt involved.
"Yep. Like Tacko Fall Kyle Anderson Bismack Biyombo Gorgui Dieng, eh?"
I saw Gorgui Dieng make one a few minutes ago and I had to make sure I wasn't dreaming
I wish the Suns picked up Gorgui Dieng so bad.
Timber wolves are 28th in defense out of 30 teams.  Enough said.  When the Wolves shined on defense last season it was with Gorgui Dieng on the floor and KAT off.  This year it‚Äôs a complete debacle.
"Even his coaching was pretty bad while he was in Minny (which is obviously an isolated case).   His offense was one of the ugliest I‚Äôve ever seen (somehow it was very effective, but I mostly chalk that up to pretty insane talent). He misused KAT and Wiggins horribly on the offensive side by effectively parking Wiggins in the corner and using KAT as nothing other than a floor spacer (partially because he was the only starter with an above average outside shot). It felt like the basis of the offense was Teague pick and rolls or Taj post ups (exclusively in the 1st quarter).   He also clung too strongly to his defensive schemes, which saw KAT too often caught defending two in the PnR (something he‚Äôs terrible at) and got away from what he could actually do (defend a single guy in space). This showed up in a very bad defensive rating despite some pretty impressive talent.  His rotation management was also awful. He played his starters tons of minutes (which was part of the reason Jimmy got pissed/injured). It was arguable that Tyus was better for the team than Teague was (a few games where Teague missed time with an injury saw the offense make more sense than it had all season since Tyus moves the ball), but Thibs continued to play Teague big minutes all season and had Tyus play like 13 minutes a game off the bench.  Finally, Thibs also failed miserably at managing the locker room (example -  he allegedly never had a single conversation with Gorgui Dieng about how he went from starting every game the year before to playing 17 minutes off the bench). The bad chemistry was palpable for most of the season and Thibs just buried his head in the sand with the hope that it would work itself out. It was so bad that Jordan Crawford left like 3 million on the table to get out a year early. And shit, the way he handled the Jimmy Butler fiasco comes down to a failure of coaching. Him ignoring the issue blew up in his face and sunk the 2018/2019 season before it even started. People forget the abomination that was the early days of the season before Jimmy got shipped out for peanuts. The dude was a jackass on the court. He‚Äôd take like 3 shots in the first 3 quarters and then wouldn‚Äôt pass the ball in the 4th. He took plays off on defense. He downright refused to pass the ball to Towns who was the Wolves best offensive player. And the team was getting its ass kicked. They were 4-9 a year after going 47-35. And Thibs just watched it happen without consequence. That is bad coaching. You have to be a leader of the team and he failed miserably at it.   That‚Äôs not to say he hasn‚Äôt been effective elsewhere. He‚Äôs clearly had a fantastic season in New York. He had some excellent seasons in Chicago before the wheels fell off. But he did a bad job in Minnesota."
"I could see Gorgui Dieng going to play there in a season or two. He's always been very active in returning to his native Senegal, and his NBA salary and minutes have been decreasing.  Having a few of these NBA guys that were born in Africa in the league could be cool, and they'd be great mentors to younger players."
"Conley/RJ/Oubre/Randle/Theis   Quickley/Sexton/Wagner/Batum/Kanter  Trey Murphy, Gorgui Dieng depth"
"You could pay Terry 25m if LaMelo is the real deal, Miles continues to improve, you get a legitimate starting C, and you have a backup PG that doesn't fuck the offense up.    But yes, the C problem is the massive issue.   Holmes is a good target, but I do think he's going to get a hefty asking price.   I think the most economical, and least sexy, solution is to target Daniel Theis and Gorgui Dieng. You could probably get both of them with our cap space, and I think they'd fit well as they kinda cover eachother's weaknesses. Plus, the money you sorta save can be used elsewhere.   I think that making a competive offer for Marvin Bagley or Mo Bamba is a good route as well, but I wouldn't do it if I had to give up Terry.   If you want to get crazy, throw a fuckton of money at Jarret Allen (definitely not the brightest idea, but I think the payoff would be worth it. But I expect Cleveland to lock that in).   Beyond that though, yea, the C market this year is a bit weak. If anything, I'd say it's worth it to spend the year throwing Carey and Richards into the fire, and wait to make a splash at C in 2022. Or maybe we luck into drafting a reliable C that can share minutes with those 2 to serve our C needs (probably very unlikely)."
"Late but the way the roster was constructed last season they DESPERATELY need a stretch 4! Early on Pop decided to glue Trey Lyles to the bench which left Lamarcus, Eubanks and a young player named Luka Samanic who was never going to get decent minutes.   So Lamarcus gets bought out,Luka spends a lot of time in the G league, and Lyles is riding the bench. They signed Gorgui Dieng to mitigate our lack of depth but it was still a glaring hole on our roster.  So now that the Spurs have a lot of cap space to work with I can see why some feel John Collins may be that piece the Spurs need. He spaces the floor and can put up some good numbers and he‚Äôs still really young. Add in their semi high draft pick I can see a guy like Kai Jones (hopefully) falling to the Spurs, however another glaring issue for the Spurs is their atrocious 3pt shooting so they just may opt for a pure shooter in the draft"
"(Fake) Rumor has it Utah was going to trade the nickname and their #1 pick via GSW to New Orleans for #1 overall in 2012, and the rights to name their team something bee related (beehive state is utah...)  Golden State fucked it up by tanking the rest of the way so they could keep the pick and get Harrison Barnes. It rolled over a year later and Jazz flipped the pick (Gorgui Dieng) with Shabazz Muhammad to get Trey Burke (oooof)  We could've had the Utah Hornets hanging up their 4th banner next week with AD, Mitchell, Gobert, and Hayward wouldn't have ever left.  And y'all could be making Miles Davis memes and making your Zion dunk plays of the game with Baker Street playing in the background.  I blame Mark Jackson"
My favorite Booker moment as a Timberwolves fan was when Gorgui Dieng and him tried to exchange jerseys outside the locker room after the game.     That was only 2 years ago.
Gorgui Dieng*
"Why?  If the team doesn't want you, you should be free to play for any team you like. Blake Griffin was free to sign with any other team, but he chose to sign for the Nets for the minimum.  So did Drummond, Batum, and Gorgui Dieng with their respective new teams.  Baseball has the same rule.  If you get waived in baseball and no one claims you after a certain number of days, you are free to sign with any other team.  Usually it's the minimum, which gets deducted from the salary your previous team is playing you.    The teams don't have to waive them.  If they could have extracted any value out of the contract they would have, but they couldn't."
"&gt;I mean Adams is better than any of those players?   I think that's highly debatable, but it's not even a question when you compare what those guys cost. Would you rather have a 1st round pick, George Hill and Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard for $5 or $3 million, respectively, or would you rather just have Steven Adams on a 3 year deal for $65 million? That's a no-brainer.   &gt; What can you get for 10mil?   Did you not see the part above in the OP's post that said:   * ""The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.""   Wasting that kind of money is *always* bad, which is why it's now being reported that the Pels are looking to dump him. Don't be surprised if it costs them more picks to do so.   &gt; Nobody is coming to the pels unless you overpay.   Wrong, the Pels could have easily traded for Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, both of whom were on expiring contracts (so they wouldn't now need to be salary dumped), and both of whom were eventually bought out. The Pels probably could have got a couple second round picks or possibly even a first to take either of those guys on. That would have been far better than paying what they did for Steven Adams."
"Even if you ""overpay"" for someone like Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard, what does that look like? $7 million per year? That's far better than giving up multiple draft picks and George Hill just to get Steven Adams for 3 years and $65 million. The Pelicans probably could have received a draft pick to take on Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, considering both guys eventually got bought out.   The Steven Adams trade and extension were just utterly stupid all the way around. Sorry."
"He gave up multiple picks and George Hill to acquire Adams on an insane $30 million contract, and then he extended him another $35 million over two extra years. Meanwhile if Griff just wanted a traditional big next to Zion he could have made Nerlens Noel, Dwight Howard, Bismark Biyombo or Mason Plumlee an offer and grabbed any one of them for a fraction of the price. Or hell, he probably could have *acquired* a pick to take someone like Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond on, considering both were eventually bought out. Who in the hell looks at Steven Adams making $65 million over 3 seasons and thinks ""he's worth giving up quality rotation players and picks for""? That should have been a fireable offense, especially when coupled with the SVG disaster."
Also the game where rookie Gorgui Dieng went for a 12/20 double double
"Rim-runners are replaceable, but there's still only a finite amount of rim-runners who are available at any given time and sometimes you gotta pay a little bit extra for the betterment of your team.  JaVale, Robin Lopez and Gorgui Dieng got all in the 4-5M per year range. The guys who got vet mins with the exception of Dwight Howard (ring-chasing) are all players that have a ton more flaws than any of the above guys."
"I can understand the lack of wanting a long-term investment but I will argue that with your team especially that JaVale was their best option and they paid slightly more than the vet min to fill a big hole in the roster.  JaVale, Robin Lopez and Gorgui Dieng got all in the 4-5M per year range. The guys who got vet mins with the exception of Dwight Howard (ring-chasing) are all players that have a ton more flaws than any of the above guys.  Rim-runners are replaceable, but there's still only a finite amount of rim-runners who are available at any given time and sometimes you gotta pay a little bit extra for the betterment of your team."
"You call an entire third of a season a hot streak huh?  Poole averaged under 10 for the first third and almost 18 for the final third and around his average for the middle of the season.  You‚Äôre not seeing a pattern of improvement?  Also, Jakob Poeltl and Gorgui Dieng are excellent defenders, emphasis on Poeltl.  It‚Äôs the only reason they still get contracts.  If you don‚Äôt like advanced stats then literally just go watch Wiggins play a game.  Or look at more basic things like opponent fg% where he held the SF to its lowest fg% of any defender in the NBA.  Seriously, just watch him defend in literally any game.  Then you‚Äôll stop spouting nonsense.  He literally earned the nickname two way Wigs for his defense this year and you‚Äôre clueless."
"Georges Niang vs Gorgui Dieng, FIGHT!"
"Hawks in 5, 6 at worst. Trae is a borderline superstar and is only gonna get better. Plus the Hawks supporting cast is way better. They also added some really nice supporting pieces this year in delon Wright and gorgui dieng"
You forgot to mention our first round draft pick Jalen Johnson.   We also added Gorgui Dieng as our backup big and Delon Wright as our backup point guard
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
"LOL.  You didn't even get a pick. You paid 50m for -.7 win shares.  Dude shot .352 from the field, .185 from 3 and .571 from the line.   I thought Grizz waived JJ, they didn't.  They waived Waiters and traded JJ for Dieng.  So paid out 24m for Waiters, 13m for Justice, and 17m for Gorgui.  So they could give Miami Jae, Iggy, and Solomon Hill.  Keep defending that."
We went into last year with Brandon Goodwin as our backup point guard and the shrug emoji as our back up center. We've added Delon Wright as a backup PG and Gorgui Dieng and brought back every single important contributor from the team that made the Eastern Conference Finals. This has been an awesome offseason and hopefully we can stay healthy this year!
"We'll see, and I'm open to being wrong. But Kings fans thought the exact same thing last offseason - just need a big body on a one-year deal to eat some minutes against opposing bigs. Whiteside was miles worse than that. He was a fucking saboteur who actually made the team worse every time he stepped on the court. The only reason he got any minutes at all was because the Kings didn't have another 7 footer on the roster until the trade deadline, when Whiteside was immediately benched for fucking Damian Jones.  I really think Jazz would have been better off with any other cheap vet at that position: Alex Len, Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, whoever. But I guess it might not matter, because there's zero chance he plays a single second in the playoffs."
"Hawks just went to the ECF, put some respeck on their name. The Bulls will need time to gel. Hawks added Gorgui Dieng who I think is an underrated player."

"Can you blame him? Timothy Mosgov, Gorgui Dieng, Joakhim Noah, and Ian Mahimini got monster deals during that  crazy summer.       Rudy Gobert got the max and Noel was closer to Gobert than those other 4."
"They picked up Delonte Wright, which they needed as a backup PG when trae is on the bench, and they needed a backup center since Okongwu is out for a few months and they picked up Gorgui Dieng, they re-signed Solomon Hill and they‚Äôre working on re-signing Collins. They don‚Äôt need to do much more they essentially wanna run it back. If Collins goes elsewhere they might be a bit more active, but if not they‚Äôre probably staying mostly put."
I also love Gorgui Dieng and was sad when we traded him to y'all
we need a 3&amp;re center to go with bam. Portis or gorgui dieng
"Dwayne dedmon and gorgui dieng are better defenders and can space the floor, and they‚Äôre cheap."
Most likely a free agent. We still have exceptions that can be used as well as a little bit of cap space. Biggest issue will be finding someone of quality that would accept a limited role once Okongwu is healthy. Someone like Gorgui Dieng I imagine we might target.
If they can pick up someone like Gorgui Dieng who can stretch the floor and soak up 15-20 minutes at center then AD at the 4 for those minutes isn‚Äôt the worst thing in the world. It‚Äôs at the end of games and playoffs where he has to fully commit to playing the 5.
"Wiggins max didn‚Äôt ruin the Wolves flexibility, being in Minnesota and having a history of losing did.  You had plenty of flexibility. You were able to trade for Jimmy Butler and then go into free agency with a lot of cap space. The Wolves did everything properly in theory.  - Get young players (Towns and Wiggins) - Consolidate other assets for star (Butler) - Get free agents while young players are still on rookie contracts and then go over the cap to extend them.  The problem is Jeff Teague, Gorgui Dieng, and Taj Gibson were what the free agency money went to.   Wiggins also wasn‚Äôt worth the max, which is part of the problem with him, while Shai obviously is. Even with that though, the biggest issue was their cap space went to guys that would quickly become bench or non-rotation players.   Wiggins max made things tough for pivoting post Butler trade, but with the Butler trade, in theory Minnesota should have been locking into a core of Butler/Towns where flexibility shouldn‚Äôt have mattered. Things just didn‚Äôt jive with that duo."
"mmmmm, idk man, I'm pretty sure we'll be sign and trading DeRozan and Gorgui Dieng for Beal, Rui, Deni, and 7 pick swaps. I've heard from many league sources this is the package lmao"
Is Robert Williams really that good? And Gorgui Dieng is Senegalese I‚Äôm pretty sure.
"&gt;I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schr√∂der and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.  So, the ""SnT Schoeder for Lonzo and fill out with good vets"" method, ala the 2020 run.  Do you think Pelicans accept that offer?"
"I don‚Äôt want Russ bc that means no depth. He isn‚Äôt bad, he‚Äôs just a bad fit for the Lakers since Lakers need 3PT shooting.   I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schr√∂der and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.   Best possible scenario I can think of.  Lonzo KCP LeBron AD Dieng during regular season.   Lonzo KCP THT LeBron AD during playoffs if THT makes a huge leap."
"For the most part you‚Äôre right; although it was pretty packed down with big men, Gorgui Dieng being chief among them."
"For someone as talentless as he was, Parker has managed to remain a conversation topic over a decade after his last NBA game.  Bravo, Smush!  I hope in 2035 we are still speaking of the great Gorgui Dieng."
Him and Gorgui Dieng used those over pays to do lots of good back in Africa
"""The Trebuchet"" is Gorgui Dieng and we've named him that out of love"
Were great teams. Along with Gorgui Dieng. Went to the final four in 2012 and won it all in 2013
"I like this one too, been thinking the same thing:   * They'll have a full season with McMillan, which will help them gel a bit more. Not only that, but they won 68.4% of their games with Nate last year, that's 56 win pace in a full, 82-game season.  * De'Andre Hunter will be back and healthy, people forget they were missing a starter who played like one of the best 3&amp;D wings to start the season.  * They brought back LouWill, who was a nice bench spark plug last year, drafted Sharife Cooper to give them some backup playmaking, picked up Gorgui Dieng (who's a reliable backup C) and Delon Wright (a really solid defensive guard), and they have a ton of high-potential guys like Cam Reddish/Jalen Johnson/Onkeya Okongwu who could break out."

"Pretty sure that was in relation to Andre Iguodala and their refusal to buy out his expiring $17 million contract. But since they ended up trading him (along with Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill) for the combined $85 million in salary of Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng, and Justise Winslow, I'm not sure they actually got any assets back. In two years those three players combined to play only 65 games for Memphis, and now all of them are no longer on the roster, with none being traded to bring back anything further."
"To make up for spending $85 million on Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng and Justise Winslow over the last two seasons. Gotta recoup that loss somehow."
"Memphis should have just bought him out on his expiring $17 million contract and been done with it. Instead they ended up trading him, Solomon Hill and Jae Crowder to Miami and got back Dion Waiters, Gorgui Dieng and Justise Winslow.   Now let's look at how that played out, shall we? They immediately ended up buying out Waiters 2 years and $25 million remaining and bought out Dieng this past year, and then Winslow left in free agency this summer. Waiters never played a game for the Grizzlies, Winslow only played a total of 26 games for Memphis and Dieng only played a total of 39 games for Memphis in the two years they had these guys.   So what did these 65 combined games over two years of Dieng and Winslow cost Memphis? Well, in addition to losing Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill, Memphis ended up spending $85 million on Waiters, Dieng and Winslow. In retrospect, simply buying out Iguodala would have been the smart move."
"Dion was on a $12.5 million contract for two years, so the Grizzlies were still paying him last season. In fact, two of the Grizzlies top 5 highest paid players last year were buyout guys who were just dead cap in Memphis (Gorgui Dieng being the other one). They paid $42 million last year for Waiters, Dieng and Winslow combined and got 26 games out of Winslow and 22 games out of Dieng for the entire season. And that was all because they didn't want to buy out Iguodala's expiring $17 million contract the year before and insisted on trading him instead. Wise choice üòÇ"
&gt;He‚Äôs on a 2-3 year deal at a Gorgui Dieng type salary while he hasn‚Äôt played half a season in the past 2 years and just got out of jail. That is not a positive asset.  Because he got stuck on a deep Nuggets team not because he's injury prone lol.
"He‚Äôs on a 2-3 year deal at a Gorgui Dieng type salary while he hasn‚Äôt played half a season in the past 2 years and just got out of jail. That is not a positive asset. Even then Maxey, Mcdaniels and Thybulle aren‚Äôt insane assets and will easily get outbid unless it has an insane amount of valuable picks."
Wait isn't Gorgui Dieng  nicknamed Trebuchet as well?
Stretch big Gorgui Dieng.

Nope - I'm a dummy.  It was Gorgui Dieng.  I thought it was Deng.
"Known 3 point assassin, Gorgui Dieng."
gorgui dieng erasure
I didn't know he was like this or if he usually is but Gorgui Dieng is looking like a great pickup for the hawks. Really might be the deepest team in the league.
I didn‚Äôt know Gorgui Dieng was a skilled player wow.
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
"Ah right, good to know that you've got some solid prospects in John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Delon Wright, Gorgui Dieng."

"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
"Jimmy Butler &gt; Bojan Bogdanoviƒá  Marquis Teague &gt; Festus Ezeli   Tony Snell &gt; Gorgui Dieng  Doug McDermott &gt; Dario Saric  Bobby Portis &gt; Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  A slight downgrade for the bulls since I‚Äôd rather have JB, Bobby, and Doug McBuckets. Of course it really wasn‚Äôt as exciting seeing as we had generally low picks these years since we were a solid playoff team."
"Gorgui Dieng, mostly when he played for the wolves. He‚Äôs so big, but looks straight lost sometimes."
"I'd already put Finch as our second or third best coach (behind Flip,  contending with Casey).     Our team is woefully undersized but he plays to its athleticism and youth, amkes  excellent substitutions,  manages playing time well, and  his rotations rarely  seem questionable to me.  And no, Thibs wasn't better.   He was the anti-finch, sucking the life out of our youthful  core  and  trying to mold them into his style, rather than playing to their strengths.  Signing wiggins to the max,  getting rid of lavine and rubio, the butler drama, and sort of derailing  the development  of Gorgui Dieng and, to a much lesser extent, Shabazz Muhammad.  You know the kind of energy the wolves have  now?  That engagmeent with the bench and the fans, the buzz in the air?   That  was there  in the mid 2010s, before thibs came in."

I don't remember this kind of reaction when Devin booker tried to fight Gorgui Dieng in the tunnel.
Thank you moose master. Gorgui Dieng forever!
Best I can do is Gorgui Dieng for LaMelo
Apparently Gorgui Dieng is deep in Mordhau
"The only time afaik something remotely close has actually happened was the [Devin Booker and Gorgui Dieng altercation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7GMJt5dIN8), even then nothing really happened after they made it to the back."
"At least the Clippers didn't sacrifice much to get him. If you want a laugh, go look at everything the Grizzlies paid and gave up for him: they traded away Jae Crowder and Andre Iguodala for him while also taking on the bloated contracts of Dion Waiters (immediately buying out his remaining $25 million) and Gorgui Dieng (whom they bought out last year), all to give Winslow a look. Winslow only wound up playing 26 games for Memphis. That's one of the least talked about disastrous trades of recent memory."
Gorgui Dieng
"You're describing what he is, not what he's seen as.  OP is correct -- people overrate ADs shooting, they act like he can shoot as well as Gorgui Dieng and he cannot."
"Gorgui Dieng, Thad Young, Daniel Theis, Khem Birch, Ed Davis, Derrick Favors. It‚Äôs tough to get rebounding defenders of starter quality cause you know they are starters for a reason."
"Is Gorgui Dieng shooting his FTs from a slight angle? His right foot sits at the middle of the line, and his left is almost at the elbow."
