just look at the minutes of shaquille harrison - nearly 10 full minutes of complete and utter nonnba basketball garbage time
"Utah has Shaquille HArrison too, Shaq just mad we have Shaquille O'Neale on the roster."
Shaquille Harrison is the only Shaq I recognize. Royce O'Neale is the only O'Neal I recognize.
"&gt;he's on pace to be better than Shaq ever was. He's a shorter, more athletic better scoring Shaq  Huh?  We're talking about Shaquille O'Neal not Shaquille Harrison."
Shaquille Harrison is no longer on the Bulls sadly; he's signed with Utah.
Coby White and Shaquille Harrison
What about [Shaquille Harrison ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_Harrison)?
Shaquille Harrison is still in the league now.
"Carmelo Anthony is Melo, this is like calling Shaquille Harrison, Shaq."
Dude that's obviously Shaquille Harrison
"Neither MPJ nor Jamal are the liability they once were. MPJ is clearly getting better at it as the season progresses. He might get blown by, but he might just end up getting a chasedown block these days. Aaron Gordon can lock down and block. Facu can easily piss off whoever he is defending (and their fans) and hold someone like curry to 25% shooting with 5 turnovers. Jokic is actually good at defense using advanced metrics, even if he isn't the best rim protector. He is one of the league leaders in steals and is great at interrupting passing lanes. McGee can be our rim protector if we need that. Dozier is solid. Shaquille Harrison has been clamping down and getting a good amount of steals and deflections in his short time on the team."
"Brandon Knight, IT, Isaiah Canaan, Elie Okobo, Shaquille Harrison (who I think they just have a two way to)  Pretty much any former Suns PG that contributed to the darkest time in my life as a sports fan."
Shaquille Harrison played 34 seconds and has the second highest +/- for Denver
Michael Carter-Williams and Deandre Jordan       Shaquille Harrison and Royce O'Neale
"Shaquille Harrison has been huge for the nuggets so far, he's definitely stepped into his role this game"
"Yeah looking at the name Shaquille. Most of famous ones seem to have been born around 92/93 which coincides with Shaq getting drafted and his first year in Orlando and not during his 3 peat. And shaq was a pretty big deal coming out of college.   Those people being Shaq Mason, Shaquille Griffin, Shaquille Harrison and Shaq Barrett.   Kind of lines up with what you said about pre internet pop culture."
Shaquille Harrison sounds like an auto-generated name too.
No lie dame got shut down when the nuggets put Shaquille Harrison in it was right after he caught fire for like 3-4 threes in a row. Then this no name came In and forced 3 terrible possessions in a row.  Edit: words an stuff.
"for anyone else reading this chain, just to show you how disconnected this dude is from reality, he doesn't consider 2:43 left in a game to be ""2 mins"" lmfao  &gt;2:43		Vlatko Cancar enters the game for Michael Porter Jr.	104 - 125	 2:43		Markus Howard enters the game for Monte Morris	104 - 125	 2:43		Shaquille Harrison enters the game for Nikola Jokic	104 - 125	 2:43		Zeke Nnaji enters the game for Aaron Gordon	104 - 125"
Did the announcer just compare shaq Harrison to Shaquille O’Neal? The and-1 dunk wasn’t all that to warrant that comparison because they have the same name lmao
Chandler Hutchison and Shaquille Harrison. Even NBA database has mistaken their measurements...
"Like you guys had Mike James, Isaiah Canaan, Tyler Ullis, Shaquille Harrison, Elfrid Payton, Eric ""I don't want to be here"" Bledsoe through the years."
"Elie Okobo, Josh Gray, Shaquille Harrison, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Davon Reed, Elfrid Payton, etc. etc.  SO MANY G League point guards were sacrificed to the point god for this finals berth."
