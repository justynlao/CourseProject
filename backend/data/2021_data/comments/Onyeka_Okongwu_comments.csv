Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I’ll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
1. DeAndre Ayton  2. Bam Adabeyo  3. James Wiseman  4. Mitchell Robinson  5. Jarrett Allen  6. Wendall Carter  *Onyeka Okongwu( Way to early to tell)
"My list on *expected whole career value*, but disagreements welcome:  1. Bam Adebeyo 2. DeAndre Ayton (but not currently this high) 3. Jarrett Allen 4. James Wiseman (too early to really know but his flashes are balanced by his decision making) 5. Wendall Carter Jr 6. Onyeka Okongwu (too early to really know) 7. Mitchell Robinson (I'm kind of low on him and think he's already peaked)"
"yeah man we wouldnt protect onyeka okongwu, our 6th pick who we tanked for lmao"
"Gallonari, reddish/bogdan(whoever doesn’t start), rondo, kris Dunn, Kevin huerter, onyeka okongwu...  This is deeper than most teams(sadly 5 of these guys are injured right now), and Gallo is maybe the best player coming off the bench in the league. Not including tony snell or Solomon hill who both got solid minutes last year. Near last huh"
"I’ve been keeping a bit of eye on the hawks, in our little sample size they are 5th in league in offensive rating and they still have Rondo, Gallanari, Bogdan and their lottery Onyeka Okongwu to get involved, think they’ll be fine."
"this is what made the Onyeka Okongwu interesting if things go according to plan he's going to be their long term starting 5 and they made that pick without even seeing Clint Capela play a game. Capela has looked better this year than last year in Houston, but I do think that's the one that will likely end up being dealt at some point.   Although at the same time while Ive thought they would get an extension done with JC, it's still quite possible he ends up walking and they dont match an offer sheet from someone next summer. I dont think theyll go into the luxury either, I dont think Bogdan will get dumped. It's either Capela or Gallinari, my guess being Capela is more likely."
Exactly. That’s what makes me so excited. It’s been more or less about the guys that we drafted and developed. Super rewarding to see. Also we haven’t even gotten to Onyeka Okongwu! If he can pan out well we will be in very good shape For years to come
"Say what you will about wiseman but the dude has serious flashes of talent. Incredible acrobatic layups that shows that he still has an all-nba ceiling. Well above your Hasheem Thabeets, Anthony Bennets, Kwame Browns.   &amp;#x200B;  He goes from straight from dunking on 6'5 teenagers to getting dunked on by Joel Embiid, playing in perhaps the most cognitively challenging offense in the NBA and being expected to play major minutes for a playoff team. you'd expect him to have some major trouble. The game is just too fast for him right now. Jordan poole was dogshit his rookie year and now he's playing closing minutes. When it's been another year I can pass judgement but right now? He's slightly behind schedule, destination unknown.  &amp;#x200B;  Just a side note, onyeka okongwu is currently playing 10 minutes a night for the Hawks. 3.8 points. Why aren't we calling him a bust already? 6th overall pick. If you gave wiseman 10 minutes a night and took all the pressure off of him in a simplified, heliocentric trae offense instead of making reads and playing with steph (while it can lead to incredible basketball, using steph's gravity is really fucking tough), he'd be doing just as well if not better."

"Well, tbh a big part of being a good rookie is being able to prove that you're a good NBA player while playing decent minutes in actual NBA games. We could sit around and talk about how Onyeka Okongwu or Precious Achiuwa could've been ROTY candidates if they got enough playing time or something to that effect, but that's still very intangible, unlike actually getting playing time at the highest level and having decent efficiency playing against NBA level players in your first year. They don't put people on All-Rookie teams based on potential, you know."
"LP was giving minutes to Bruno Fernando, one of the worst players in the league, over our first round pick onyeka okongwu. In a near 20 point blowout tonight Bruno was -19. That’s how much of a dipshit LP was. He should never get a head coaching job again."
Onyeka Okongwu too
"I wanted Okongwu over Okoro on draft day.  Way too early to say whether my gut instinct was right or wrong, but regardless I'm always gonna have a soft spot for Onyeka.  Happy to see him do well!"
"LETS FUCKING GO, TRAE IS A FOUL BAITER, ONYEKA OKONGWU IS THE SECOND COMING OF JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF"
The only thing I want to talk about is Onyeka Okongwu. He’s going to be so good
"Onyeka, and I cannot express this enough, Okongwu."
"Well, Lonzo and Onyeka Okongwu are also in the NBA."
Bam Adebayo got sent to the Mariana Trench by Onyeka Okongwu but keep talking ur shit brother

"This is what Hollinger says:  &gt;Hollinger: I had Hayes ranked as the No. 3 player on my board, and while that first part of the season was a ghastly mess, he’s shown of late why his passing and defense got scouts’ attention. Looking at the overall body of work, I still have to move him down a bit — certainly behind Haliburton, for instance — because his stat line remains brutal.   &gt;However, given that few players from this lottery have made a thundering impression (my fourth- and fifth-ranked players, for instance, were Onyeka Okongwu and Obi Toppin), I think it still makes sense to snag Hayes here. My one misgiving about Hayes is that his passing isn’t really going to weaponize until he can become more of a threat as a scorer, and that’s the one part of his game that’s the iffiest to project. Nonetheless, on-ball talent always wins out in any draft scenario; Hayes still has a chance to be a team’s lead creator, and that’s worth the roll of the dice here."
Unbiased opinion   MVP - Trae Young  DPOY - Clint Capela  6MOY - Lou Williams  MIP - Brandon Goodwin  COY - Nate McMillan  ROY - Onyeka Okongwu
"Onyeka ""Despite the Loss"" Okongwu"
"This comment is funny but I feel like it does a really bad job of explaining how hard the Hawks make it to close down shooters like this on the perimeter. John Collins, Onyeka Okongwu, and Clint all routinely set really hard screens against smaller Philly defender constantly and make it really hard to just shadow/double a player like Lou. Lou, Gallo, and Bogi and trae are high % 3 point shooters ans that lineup + Collins exploited phillys defense against Atalanta screens and Lou started cookin"
"Capela plays in front of him and is usually a monster against centers not named Joel Embiid. He led the league in rebounding, top five blocks, and 6th in dpoty voting this year   Onyeka started his rookie season late w a foot injury and took a while to start learning the nba game. He’s got sick potential though, last game of the season we sat Capela and it was really fun watching Okongwu just murder the Rockets (granted it was the Rockets lol)"
"We would have still been a lottery team, but being where we were the past 2 seasons only *slightly* better would have likely meant no DeAndre Hunter, no Cam Reddish, no Onyeka Okongwu, and probably no Clint Capela since that deal hinged on our draft capital."
What do y’all think about Onyeka Okongwu?
"I’m gonna go with Cole Anthony, Obi Toppin, and Onyeka Okongwu."
Yea Hill went from barely playin vs Knicks to starting now bc Hunter out. Def start Huerter or even Onyeka Okongwu so him and Capela can slow down Embiid
Onyeka Okongwu my favorite player!!!!
bro i fuckin love Onyeka Okongwu
watch my boy Onyeka Okongwu come clutch
"Onyeka Okongwu on the Hawks , I think that kid mad good defensively and def has good potential and is basically ideal backup for Capela who also is also exceeded my expectations and confirmed himself as one of the most underrated C in the league"
"Pretty good argument to be made that Onyeka Okongwu played the best 6 minute stretch of any player tonight.  But let's have the most unathletic player on either roster whose one tool is shooting, which he is doing poorly, play center in the 4th quarter."
"At the moment Capela is resting or in foul trouble, the Sixers will licking their chops. They will play John Collins for a small lineup or Onyeka Okongwu as a backup centre, that's going to be the biggest disaster. Embiid going to shit down Capela's throat and foul him out. If Sixers are locked in, Sixers in 4 or 5. The sixers are a much better team, with more playoff experience and probably better coaching."
"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people. Wise investment here for the NBA. It also makes me wonder whether they'll be investing in India as well, another place with a huge population and the potential to produce NBA players and grow the NBA's international audience"
"The Hawks have a player named ""Onyeka Okongwu""  That sounds like a Star Wars character."
Onyeka Okongwu with the inefficient 10/13 shooting night smh  Think OP meant to put efficient lol

"What's crazy is Gelo was the high scorer on the high school squad with Lonzo, Melo and Onyeka Okongwu"
"players who get wishfully compared a lot to Draymond Green because they are pretty skilled, they look like they are too small to play center a lot but center is still probably/aspirationally their best position, and if you squint hard they seem like maybe they could be multi-position defenders  Tier 1 - Draymond Green, ΟG Anunoby, Ben Simmons  Tier 2 - Onyeka Okongwu, Daniel Theis, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson, Robert Covington, PJ Tucker  Tier 3 - Grant Williams, DJ Wilson, JaMychal Green"
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
Onyeka Okongwu
Onyeka Okongwu
&gt; Jaylen Brown for Cam Reddish and Onyeka Okongwu and the **hawks** say no
Let me introduce you to one Onyeka Okongwu
"I think it's them plus DeAndre Hunter, Reddish, Onyeka Okongwu and the guys already making money like Capela/Bogdanovic. It's likely that the Hawks won't keep everyone from that group, but they're all looking like expensive players."
Zion Williamson - 28/10 on 62/30/72 shooting  DeAndre Hunter - 15/4 on 45/35/85  RJ Barrett - 18/6/4 on 45/37/77  Ja Morant - 21/4/8 on 43/32/74  Mikal Bridges - 13/5 on 50/40/85  Cam Reddish - 10/5 on 38/31/80  Kevin Porter Jr. - 18/3/7 on 41/30/76  Anthony Edwards - 22/4/4 on 43/35/80  LaMelo Ball - 16/7/8 on 44/37/78  James Wiseman - 14/9 on 55/33/70  Patrick Williams - 11/6 on 46/37/72  Onyeka Okongwu - 7/7 on 60/-/60  Tyrese Halliburton - 14/4/6 on 45/40/85  Killian Hayes - 11/3/6 on 37/34/80
Cam Reddish - Paul George   DeAndre Hunter - Kawhi Leonard lite  Michael Porter Jr - Brandon Ingram  Patrick Williams - Jimmy Butler  Onyeka Okongwu - Lanky Serge Ibaka  RJ Barrett - Danny Granger  Kevin Porter Jr - Dollar Store Harden
"Trae Young (22), Kevin Huerter (22), Cam Reddish (21), DeAndre Hunter (23),   John Collins (23), Onyeka Okongwu (20).  Got to be up there for best young cores in the league, especially with how they've almost all proven themselves in these playoffs."
Cam reddish is Kobe DeAndre Hunter is kawhi and onyeka okongwu is obviously shaq. No bias at all
"Nah, man. Last year's NBA draft was equally terrible. The coverage about Onyeka Okongwu was disgusting, and they focused on few others too, like Cash Winston."
Isn’t Onyeka Okongwu literally what Hanzo says in Overwatch.
Time to unleash Onyeka Okongwu
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"Man, I really wanted us to trade for Onyeka Okongwu. I was super high on the guy, I saw a league that's slowly trending towards more perimeter oriented, and Onyeka's strong enough to still outmuscle most centers, and quick laterally enough to contest more shooters/not get slaughtered on PnR defense.   I see the Bam comparisons, although Bam's game at Kentucky was different than how he's utilized more in the DHO's with Spoelstra's Heat. I still could see OO doing well on most teams that had proper spacing. His game reminds me of a mix of Bam/Tristan Thompson/T-Rez, where he's going to have an insane motor.  OO's game on offense is still not polished enough, but he certainly has the tools + work ethic and swagger to make it work.   I love me some Timelord, and I think he's our center of the future. I cannot deny there are times where I question his durability and health, and other than the foot injury that OO had early on, he's been a relatively healthy guy. He's someone I coveted on the C's.   Smfh at those calling bust though."
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
Onyeka Okongwu &amp; Cam Reddish are both 20 years old
Can we talk about Onyeka Okongwu?? What a showing
He's shaking because he's gotta play more minutes against Onyeka Okongwu
Onyeka Okongwu really gonna carry us to the finals
Onyeka okongwu 25/27 dunks only and the two misses are because the rim disintegrated by the 4th
ONYEKA OKONGWU COMING UP HUGE IN GAME THREE OF THE ECF. IM CRYING
would hawks fans be willing to trade onyeka okongwu? i know a team or two that could use him
Onyeka Okongwu is the brother Giannis wished he had
"Also, more importantly unlike Simmons, the Hawks can afford to pull Capela for a bit without crippling themselves on either end. Onyeka Okongwu has proven himself to be more than capable of taking over Capela’s role when needed"
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
"For a second I actually thought to myself, we have a Nigerian on the team? Then I remembered that his name is actually Onyeka Okongwu and not OO or young buck or anything of the things I yell at my tv when he makes a play."
Which netted us Onyeka Okongwu
Onyeka Okongwu has been absolutely HUGE this game
"Hawks draft picks in top 15 since 2016:  1. Trae Young  * Starter. All-Star. 2. Cam Reddish  * 26 games, 21 starts this season. 0 playoff games. 3. Deandre Hunter  * 23 games, 19 starts this season. 5 playoff games played (Knicks series, 0 in Philly series) 4. Onyeka Okongwu  * Rookie. Backup center. 50 games, 4 starts this season. Played every games in the playoffs.   Yes, the other two are injured, but they didn't have a huge impact on how this playoff run is going."
He was out played by rookie Onyeka Okongwu for most of the series
Trae Young  (It would've been either him or Luka since the Hawks wanted a PG.)  Kevin Hueter (19th pick)  DeAndre Hunter (Needed perimeter defense. Best perimeter defender in the class.)  John Collins (Also 19th pick)  Onyeka Okongwu (Needed a backup center. High upside.)
Onyeka Okongwu is fun to say
1. MIN - LaMelo Ball  2. GSW - Tyrese Haliburton  3. CHA - Anthony Edwards  4. CHI - Patrick Williams  5. CLE - Saddiq Bey  6. ATL - Onyeka Okongwu  7. DET - Immanuel Quickley  8. NYK - Desmond Bane  9. WAS - Isaiah Stewart  10. PHX - Devin Vassell  11. SAS - Deni Avdija  12. SAC - Isaac Okoro  13. NOP - Jalen Smith  14. BOS - Xavier Tillman
I really liked Onyeka Okongwu for the Hawks in the time I saw him in the playoffs. Hopefully the shoulder heals.
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
"Trade for Onyeka Okongwu, you won't"
Onyeka Okongwu
"It doesn't ruin anything for me. Advanced stats are useful for capturing some things, but you can't rely on them when it comes to evaluating players in totality. I think they're more useful for specific lineups than individual players.  What I can't get on board with is people using stats as an attempt to ""objectively"" rank players, when the choice of which stat(s) to use is inherently subjective and already prone to confirmation bias. Like If you ranked players by PER, and made no conclusions from it, then you have an objective ranking based on PER. But it's the leap to ""LeBron James is better than Onyeka Okongwu because his PER is better"" that turns it subjective. And I get why people do it, but it would ruin the game for me if I did it."
onyeka okongwu
Idk but I remember his AAU team or something played vs Zion and it was really big deal. Maybe he wasn't always a top prospect but people have at least known about him since that famous Chino Hills team with his brothers and Onyeka Okongwu
"Just to add:  Isaac Okoro - Cavs,  Chinezie Metu- Sac,  Chuma Okeke - Orl,  Onyeka Okongwu - Atl,  Zeke Nnaji - Denver,  Udoka Azubuike - Jazz,  Desmond Bane - Mem,  Jordan Nwora - Bucks,  Daniel Oturu - Clips  Monte Morris - Den"
Depends on 'young' but there's a few others:  * Bobby Portis (26) might not have played inn the Brooklyn series but was huge when Giannis went down and proved his worth in the conference finals and finals.  * Onyeka Okongwu (20) showcased some really strong defense against Giannis  * Basically the entire Atlanta Hawks team  * Terance Mann (24)  * Dillon Brooks (25)   I've probably missed some but those are the ones that stood out to me
"Other than the Cavs, none of the teams in this top 5 are really lottery dwellers. Plus the talent base in this class is pretty great compared to your average year. Compare the top 5 mock from last year to this one, where Isaac Okoro/ Onyeka Okongwu were pretty regularly getting mocked in that range vs. Suggs/Kuminga/Barnes"
Onyeka Okongwu looked better against him than anyone else this postseason
"Not beating any one of them 1v1, but if I just have to score one to win, I'd pick either IT (5'9"") or someone injured like Edmond Sumner, Onyeka Okongwu."
"Not as star-powered with some gems: Demar DeRozan, Evan Mobley, Onyeka Okongwu, Nikola Vucevic, Gus Williams, Paul Westphal"
&gt;Jaren Jackson Jr   &gt;DeAandre Ayton   &gt;Bam Adebayo   &gt;Onyeka Okongwu   &gt;Evan Mobley  AD lite  Robert Parish  Kirkenko  Bam lol  Jermaine O'Neal
"Young players on good teams usually, like Onyeka Okongwu"
Chino Hills with the Ball brothers and Onyeka Okongwu has a good case. The last dude still has a chance to make it too.  https://youtu.be/DdDsZqege98
"I think in general there's just a lot more behind-the-scenes jockeying as it comes to roster construction. For example, a couple writers really raked the Hawks over the coals for drafting Onyeka Okongwu instead of Tyrese Haliburton, then it came out that Haliburton/his team didn't want him in ATL. 98% of those stories don't reach the public, but we as fans still wonder why x trade didn't happen or y signing never occurred."
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De’Andre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
"Okongwu had a very up and down rookie year based on injuries. If he ends up being injured over the next several seasons, Capela is austincibly the de facto starter until we stumble upon a better option.  But the best part is Capela will be like 30 or so when the contract ends, so we will have the best years of his NBA career on our squad.  Hope Onyeka pans out with health. Rough but promising start."
*Onyeka Okongwu
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
I know who Onyeka Okongwu is. It's just that it's hard to recall his name just from the initials OO. But I guess it's just me then...
"Onyeka Okongwu, the current backup center for us,  but he's going to miss a few months due to an injury."
"Ah you're right - I'm terribly sorry! How could I forget Onyeka Okongwu, the second year center who averaged 12 min/game last season. I should have known."
"Onyeka Okongwu. You know, the only guy in the entire league who has the initials OO."
I know right. Like save everyone some time and write or copy+paste the man's full name. Don't make everyone scour the Hawks' roster to find a man with the initials OO (it's Onyeka Okongwu ... I think).
"Collins, Capela, and OO(Onyeka Okongwu). Not to mention our rookie duo is a refresh of Trae and Collins."
"Patrick Williams, Onyeka Okongwu, Josh Green, Tyrese Maxey. When in doubt, bet on youth."
"for some reason, I really like Onyeka Okongwu"
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"Cavs:  *2016: Kay Felder - Marcus Paige  We didn’t select Felder, but the Hawks traded him to us on draft night.  2017: No draft selections  2018: Collin Sexton - Kevin Knox  2019: Darius Garland - Jarrett Culver   2020: Isaac Okoro - Onyeka Okongwu  Yeah I’ll stick with what we drafted."
Middle school aged kid wearing an Onyeka Okongwu jersey was interesting. Especially since I live in Texas
"Clint Capela has visibly lost a step after nursing an Achilles injury all off season and our backup C, Onyeka Okongwu, is out for half the season.  We’re getting obliterated in the paint, over correcting and then getting obliterated on the perimeter."
"2017 - John Collins  2018 - Trae Young, Kevin Huerter  2019 - Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish  2020 - Onyeka Okongwu  2021 - Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously I'm biased but I'd say the Hawks have drafted better. Every single one of the guys on this list has starter level upside (if they haven't realized it yet) and are going to cause a money squeeze on the Hawks because of how good they all are. The Grizz probably have picked guys better equipped to be rotation and role guys but the Hawks seem to have a lot of guys who would be on a lot of team's starting lineups"
