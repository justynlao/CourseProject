Give Tacko Fall time and maybe a new team. He‚Äôs going to make a big impact. Just look at how he played against Zion in the NCAA tournament. He just needs minutes.
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."

Just give it to us and the players so we can vote for Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall
"Still can‚Äôt believe the mad lad said that. He‚Äôs right, but you don‚Äôt see Tacko Fall doing what Giannis does. Still takes skill but on one aspect of the game. Can‚Äôt expect a 7fter to have handles like kyrie"
"I was thinking about it, and I'm pretty sure that if I had a running start AND got to use a trampoline, AND Tacko Fall was only allowed to stand still with his arms straight up, I still wouldn't be able to dunk on him"

Hello it's me Tacko Fall
"Are you saying Lowry didn't have amazing moments as a Raptor? Game 6 of the NBA Finals. The pass over Tacko Fall to OG for the game winning buzzer beater in the bubble. Putting up 35 points, 9 assists and 4 steals on the Heat to clinch Game 7 in 2016. Hitting a half court shot to take us to OT in the 2016 ECSF against the Heat. Hitting the big yeet three last year, and hitting it again this year. Taking multiple charges in the All Star Game including one on Harden that would have ended with the game winning bucket.  The fuck are you talking bout, we don't got too many moments like that with Lowry? We have countless moments to remember Lowry with."
"Yeah, and you have the next Kareem in Tacko Fall"
"0 minute out of Curry is not nearly the same impact as 0 minutes out of noted sharpshooter Tacko Fall, though. On a serious note it will be exciting to see how both teams and the rest of the conference shakes out, a lot of teams seem to be trending upwards right now."

"One of the things that pisses me off about this story every time I read about it is that Hedo Turkoglu is an adviser to the Erdogan, and claims that Kanter‚Äôs fears over his life are irrational.

"That 30-inch average is also a standing vert, which it sounds like you‚Äôre comparing to your max.   A lot of top prospects don‚Äôt ever do official/published max vert testing, so any average you see is probably too low anyway. In the 2019 draft, the top eight picks all sat the physical testing out. The ninth pick, Jaxson Hayes, had a 34.5-inch max vert, and he‚Äôs a 6-11 center. So his max vertical (which I‚Äôd guess is probably about league average) is about 140% of your vertical.   Also, consider the athleticism of Tacko Fall (26.5‚Äù max) and Boban Marjanovic (23‚Äù max). Your 25‚Äù estimate for your max vert is roughly in between two generally unathletic giants. Gobert, who I‚Äôd say makes both guys look like snails, ‚Äúonly‚Äù has a max vert of about 29‚Äù. A few extra inches in vertical max is a lot."

"**BALL IN HANDS, THE BASKET IN SIGHT, TACKO MAKES THE THREE FALL ALL NIGHT**"
"2 main reasons:  1. He is 7ft 5in, with a 8ft+ wingspan. Someone like that this a not usually a shooter. In fact this isn‚Äôt either, but the fact he made this is really good for someone whose purpose would most likely be stay in the key and pick the ball up above everyone else and dunk it without even dunking or trying.  2. He is a fan favourite. If you look at Tacko Fall highlights, you can see every time his even on the floor, the crowd goes ecstatic. If crowds were allowed, this would be something worth watching for someone who doesn‚Äôt watch basketball just for the reaction alone."

"Not leaving the paint to guard Embiid or AD‚Äôs mid range would be a terrible decision though. its true that it would make someone like Jokic a better defender, but someone who can actually protect the rim would just feast in the paint on defense, while not having to expend so much energy. Tacko Fall could actually be playable.   Point is, the value of rim protectors would skyrocket. Someone like Embiid or AD, already top 5-10 players, would be significantly better than they are now."

"You can say ‚ÄúKeep in mind‚Äù but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his ‚ÄúLA or bust‚Äù thing wasn‚Äôt even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don‚Äôt really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn‚Äôt been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."

"You‚Äôre right. At the same time, I think Boban would likely be out of this league if he was even just 7ft (as much as I love this guy as a Mavs fan). Or Tacko Fall if he was a normal sized center. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre unskilled, but the talent level is clearly different to shorter guys. What keeps them in the league is not even having to jump to outrebound or dunk on someone."

"Just looking at some of the oldest players still in the league that likely could be had for cheap:  Iguodala (37)  Marc Gasol (36)  Carmelo (36)  JJ Redick (36)  Ariza (35)  Dwight (35)  Lou Williams (34)  Deandre Jordan (32)  Derrick Rose (32)  Blake Griffin (31)  Boogie (30)       The question is does he realize potential primes? like for the Celtics he could bring back Kemba, but does Tacko Fall become an even larger KG? or does he even reach current Dwight Howard level? or is it based on Prime that has actually happened to this date?       Either way,  Gasol/Boogie/Derrick Rose/Blake Griffin + Time Lord would pretty much be unstoppable. And that lineup is only $49m this year (2.5+2.5+8+36m) or only $15m if you take Melo instead of Blake.  So id still have over $95m to make a roster which i could make another super team out of and even if i bench Timelord, the old fellas are still competent role players without the Time Boost"

Tacko fall supermax
"You can't evaluate IQ based on press interviews or public persona, that's mostly just going to measure pre-NBA socioeconomics, parental influence, the age when others encouraged them to pump the brakes academically in favor of focusing on basketball 40+ hours a week. and emotional intelligence not spatial/verbal. Tacko fall had great SATs and a difficult major, you can measurably say that he's likely pretty smart. But somebody like Russell Westbrook who is not great in the press and plays a style of basketball that is antithetical to modern analytics might not be called smart despite documented history of strong academics(Jeremy Lin also plays the same high turnover, high athleticism, middling efficiency game as Westbrook, but we can easily say hes smart cuz hatvard). Also I feel like if you went through a list of all white nba players you'd have a hard time saying that a guy is dumb even though statistically a few have to be.  These lists are fun and I love learning about dual excellence in people like Jaylen Brown or David Robinson who are gifted athletically and academically. But it's real easy to make mistakes like  Goldwater rule diagnosing from afar or Charles Murray's bell curve. I think it's best to assume that most people are reasonably smart and with effort can grasp most concepts and that with rare exceptions what we call smart when we see it in a press conference is mostly just socioeconomics merging with things like curiosity, incentives to learn, anxiety leading to over preparation and the presence of adult figures in childhood and mentors in early adulthood"

"To be fair, the requirement to get in was jumping over Tacko Fall"
"Luka is an absolute maestro of the offense, he lulls defenders to sleep with his moves, catches them at weird angles and pulls off these seemingly impossible shots at the craziest times...undoubtedly he is the more skilled player and I would say pretty emphatically the best guy under 25 to try to win a title with this year.   I do think that the one inherent advantage Zion has over Luka is being such a freak, such a pure athletic force that it distracts the defense and causes mistakes and panic because at a certain point it‚Äôs barely basketball anymore, it‚Äôs like blocking a Defensive End in midair...I think so many of the great centers that have tried to defend Zion end up out of sorts later in the game because they are so focused on trying to figure out how to stop this freight train.   The obvious comparison is to Shaq or LeBron, but I would use this one - I saw Tacko Fall at the summer league in ‚Äò19, and while he was nowhere near the best player on the Celts team, it was incredible how much of a focus he became when he was on the court. The entire crowd of course was chanting his name, but you could see the defenders on the other team lose focus and become distracted because they don‚Äôt quite know how to handle a 7‚Äô7, 300lb guy - it‚Äôs just barely basketball anymore it‚Äôs a pure duel of athletes.    This got hella rambly, but I wanna conclude with this - fuck Luka and Porzingis, fuck Zion and BI, forget all the Dallas trade talks for Beal or whoever - give me Luka + Zion on a team for the next ten years and I think they‚Äôd be the GOAT combo. I love comparing and contrasting their games because they are both so dominant but in such unique ways, and it certainly seems like the skills of one would greatly complement the skills of the other."
and we have 2 of them. tacko fall and uncle kornet.
Or tacko fall
"Harden initiates the offense and handles the ball the most because he's the point guard and he's an amazing passer. Durant is relied upon as their reliable, unguardable scorer. And Durant runs the offense too, it's not like he's some kind of spot-up shooter.  Why on Earth do you keep bringing up size as though it's irrelevant to the sport of basketball? Are you gonna elaborate on how it's somehow unimportant, yet the average NBA player is like 6'6""? You gave the example of Tacko Fall, which if anything is a credit to what I'm saying. Tacko Fall is in the NBA exclusively because of his height. Wouldn't that imply that height is coveted at least to an extent? Perhaps because it grants the player an advantage, even if they're otherwise trash at basketball like Tacko? If Tacko was 6'4"" he wouldn't be in the league.  Durant being 7' with guard skills allows him to shoot over anyone and be unguardable. It's not difficult."
Did you already forget about Tacko Fall?

What‚Äôs Tacko Fall up to   God damn, you're absolutely right. No idea how being taller or having longer arms could possibly be advantageous in a game that emphasizes verticality. So you're telling me height makes no difference? KD having an insane wingspan doesn't help him at all? Yeah, ig that's why the league is full of average 5'9"" dudes, huh"

"I'm gonna preorder that Tacko Fall book for my 5yo son asap  Every night when he goes to bed while the Celts game is on, the next morning he'll ask me two questions: 1) Did the Celtics win? and 2) Did Tacko Fall play?"
Scott foster can get anally fucked by tacko fall
"Tacko Fall already got one brewing, wow"
"PJF performance (Worked with NBA guys like Harden, Embied, Tacko Fall, etc) has a podcast and one episode talks about how overrated  stretching is"
Okay &amp; Zion struggled against Tacko Fall LMAOOOOOOO
Tacko Fall
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
Tell that to me watching Tacko Fall in college getting slapped with that shit every game even though he would literally just grab it the person trying to box out without even making contact.

"Heck! Have lebron jump with you and do under lebron too. Don‚Äôt do 360s, do 720 no scopes. Don‚Äôt jump over the hood of a car or Tacko Fall, jump over an army tank piloted by Tacko Fall."
"Then be on their level. It‚Äôs not hard to understand. Don‚Äôt do eastbays, do under both legs. Don‚Äôt do 180s, do 360s. Don‚Äôt jump over the hood of a car, jump over Tacko Fall. Easy peasy."
"Fact: Tacko Fall was a minus 12,960 per 36 min in Game 3 of the second round against the Raptors in 2020."
"We got the GOAT Tacko Fall as well!  But yeah, we'll be pretty thin. On the bright side, you typically don't *need* an elite center to be a good team. Most centers in the league are journeymen. The only good centers in the league are the ones who play like wing players anyways tbf."
Tremont Waters in shambles. Tacko Fall GOAT.
Im going with the great tacko fall
"This year it would be Tacko Fall, Caruso, Kuzma, Herro in some order plus Curry, just to throw everyone off ... until they realize it's Seth, not Steph."
Maybe tacko fall
r/nba: Bro where is Brian Scalabrine Alex Caruso Tacko Fall Joe Ingles and Bol Bol?
"I would honestly rather get the 8 seed and fuck around with Philly or lose out the rest of the way than end up with the 7 and have to deal with a healthy Nets team. Given how this season has gone though, we'll get the 7 and then Jayson Tatum will trip over Tacko Fall in practice and sprain his ankle before the playoffs."
"Nate Darling. His career highlight so far is boxing out Tacko  Fall.   He appeared in maybe 3 or 4 games, then we had to actually give him a few rotation minutes due to almost all our guards being out with injuries, then he sprained an ankle after like a minute and missed a month."
"The GOAT himself, Tacko Fall"
Celtics:   Tacko Fall and his 4 shadow clones with Kornet off the bench
&gt; I would have taken carsen and tacko  There is no way that tacko fall is ever traded to another nba team.  He isn‚Äôt an nba player and I think he was only signed to sell tickets for meme potential.   I‚Äôm guessing that there is a gentleman‚Äôs agreement among owners that he‚Äôs never a legit piece.

Last night Paul George fell twice in the game. Kuzma hit the floor once as well. Pretty sure I saw Siakam fall too. Tacko Fall has obviously fell many times and is not injured. Basketball is a physical game. Many players have fell but not because of injuries
Blocked by trae young and making tacko fall look like Hakeem send his ass to Lithuania.
"&gt; I feel like the answer to fixing player/ref interactions is to just air them all and let the public decide   That will never go well. If we let the public decide things in the NBA, Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall would have multiple all-star selections lol"

"Damn 28.8 blocks per 36, Tacko Fall for GOAT defender?"
"Yes, you‚Äôre correct, the word he was looking for is **dialogue**.   It‚Äôs **dialogue** instead of **monologue** because it‚Äôs an internal dialogue with two opposing viewpoints fighting back and forth ‚Äî does he block the jumper or guard the basket?   It‚Äôs **dialogue** instead of **diatribe** because a diatribe is essentially a rant. You would maybe give a diatribe about how you think ‚Äúthe NBA has become too soft and relied too much on 3 point scoring and foul shooting from flops.‚Äù   You could give a diatribe on why the Celtics severely underutilize the league‚Äôs next MVP in Tacko Fall, but it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to say that you had a diatribe on whether he was going to shoot or dunk, because you‚Äôre having an internal dialogue about a future prediction, not actually criticizing an idea about life. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
Why do the Celtics treat Tacko Fall like a special Ed‚Äôs kid that gets to suit up for a game lol
We need a Tacko Fall song now
The buck stops here. With tacko fall. THIS is where we make our stand.
Tacko ‚ÄúKevin McHale‚Äù Fall
Why are we wasting our time with Jayson Tatum when we have Tacko Fall
"Romeo Langford has been a great defender this year but is basically a 0 on offense. He still hasn't had a healthy offseason yet and missed most of this year with injury and COVID so most fans still have a lot of hope for his ability to develop.  Grant Williams has gotten a lot better at 3 point shooting this year but his defense has slipped a bit. Fouls too much and gets blown by too easily. Drew a short straw with the rotation situation since his best position is small-ball 5 and we had 3 rotation centers ahead of him for the majority of the year. If he can get his defense up to par, he can definitely have a good career as a role player.  Carsen Edwards hasn't been as garbage as he was last year but he still doesn't belong anywhere near a rotation. When his shot isn't falling, he adds literally nothing on the court.   Tremont Waters has had some good moments when he plays with the actual rotation guys when the team is short-handed but when he is out there with the third-stringers it has been disastrous. Tough to be anything but a liability when you are 5'10.   Tacko Fall hasn't really changed at all since his first year. Very situational player. Makes too many mistakes. He is beloved by all though so it is nice having him on the roster."
1.	Alex Caruso 2.	Tacko Fall 3.	McGee 4.	LeMickey 5.	ADisney
Tacko Fall
ah yes future DPOY level player Tacko Fall.
My top 5:  1. Elfrid Payton  2. Frank Ntilikina  3. Tacko Fall  4. Cory Joseph  5. Lebron James
Boban and tacko fall wouldve won all the mvps if that was the case rn.
Next game Smart Kemba and Fournier are gonna form a three man pyramid while Tacko Fall throws Peyton Pritchard into it
1. Yao Ming  2. Gheorghe Muresan  3. Oliver Miller  4. Glen Davis  5. Tacko Fall (but there is still time!)
Steph Curry Alex Caruso Klay Thompson Udonis Haslem Tacko Fall
Tacko Fall and Grant Williams are planning a podcast together as well
"I don't know how the school system in America works, the point is dude didn't look good at all, then he had a growth spurt and became fucking good. The same happened to Dennis Rodman at an even later age, and Scottie Pippen, and many other Basketball players.  Dude when discussing about these things it's obvious that health is taken into consideration without mentioning it.  Bol Bol, Tacko Fall and Hasheem Thabeet were unhealthy as fuck and lazy as fuck too. There are 7+ foot tall dudes in wheelchairs that doesn't mean that they are automatically better than the rest, the health factor is something I shouldn't even mention but since you came up with those dudes.   If you are a healthy 7+ foot tall dude you can became the greatest if you put a little bit of effort. Look at Shaquelle O'Neal, dude was the laziest human being on planet earth but still got to the very top just by being tall as fuck.   And just because being tall is the most important thing thay doesn't mean that hard work doesn't play a factor.   Shaquelle O'Neal was a lazy fat ass who could have become by far the greatest of all time if he put 5% of the effort someone like 5'7'' Isaiah Thomas put to get into the NBA."
"He got rejected by the varsity team as a Sophomore. Two years later he was the best high school player in the nation.  Edit: he didn‚Äôt get super tall. mj is 6‚Äô6‚Äù, and in 2019-2020 the median nba height was 6‚Äô7‚Äù.   If height was what mattered, the most Bol Bol, Tacko Fall, and Hasheem Thabeet would be some of the greatest players of all time."
4x clones of Steven Adams linking elbows to form a human shield wall while Tacko Fall stands behind it and throws Inspector Gadget-range punches. Unbeatable.
"Ah, so Denver has a human meme too, that serves as a victory cigar? Tacko Fall is not as unique as I thought then..."
"When Zion was in the NCAA tournament and going up against UCF and Tacko Fall in the 2nd round, Tacko was asked if he was going to let Zion dunk on him and (of course) he said no. A reporter asked Zion what he thought about that and Zion's response was something along the lines of ""Well what's he going to say? That he'll let me dunk on him"". And when Duke lost to MSU a week later he spent half of his post game interview praising MSU and how well they played. He's a great sport and personality"
Do you think Tacko Fall should have a bigger role on the team?
Learn how to read.  Payton and Bob are the two that can get minutes. The jays and smort werent mids or 2nds. Yeah the young guys might work out but history shows that they probably won't. Edwards and waters are not ever going to be good. Grants a maybe. Tacko is fun but not an nba player.  I haven't seen anything from Romeo that leads me to believe he'll ever stay in the floor or contribute. Maybe Nesmith manages to stick around for his shooting. You're hoping those teams fall off. Lots of teams retool on the fly rather than rebuild. ADs not even 30.
If it‚Äôs a vote for most useless meme player then it‚Äôs a race between Frank Ntilikina and Tacko Fall.
I saw Tacko Fall get an and-1 the other night and it was the most unstoppable thing I had ever witnessed
"Don't forget Tacko Fall. He's from Senegal. Interestingly, Fall selected the jersey number 99 with the Celtics as a reference to the 99 Names of Allah."
"Actually, I have a plan to save the WNBA.   Tacko Fall now identifies as a woman."
Lmao Tacko Fall looks like Cobra Commander
Tacko Fall season averages? Idk
"Tacko Fall = human victory cigar, Carsen Edwards = human cigarette in a prison yard"
Didn't OG literally hit a game winner when Tacko Fall was defending the inbounds pass
"It‚Äôs so funny when Brad Stevens puts Tacko Fall on the inbounder, it makes them struggle so much"
"5'9"" Isiah Thomas Jr and 7'5"" Tacko Fall develop a bond as they bring their team to a game 7 NBA Finals."
‚ÄúGiannis is too small to defend Bol Bol and Tacko Fall! Especially when they pull up from half court.‚Äù
"I don't get why people hate on Per 36 numbers so much, it just added context for role players  For example Tacko Fall is putting up 14/14 with 4 blocks this year, which is elite   Better than the eye test in my opinion /s"
"Tacko Fall, and Frank is easily better than him"
Tacko Fall
"I agree on the conditioning aspect of the early 2000s basketball.  Early 90s Shaq aged to the modern game without weight gain and a 12'4 max vertical was who I was referring to.  The trend around the league, however, has been in opposition to your point.  There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%.   Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan and Brandon Ingram are all guys who were positionally terrible from the free throw line and made record breaking improvements after working with modern free throw coaching. Even Tacko Fall is finding time on the floor for non-meme minutes after being unplayably bad from the free throw line at USF.  Shaquille O'Neal did not focus as much on free throws, this is known.  He had one good free throw season in LA and basically said ""Im good."". Better coaching and general social pressure would force him to do so today and he wouldn't be one hand scooping the ball like he did with Miami."
&gt;Tacko Fall would become a max player  You say that like he isn't already. . .
No it really isn‚Äôt   Just think about it  Tacko Fall would become a max player
If I could make the case for the Boston Celtics.  1. 17 championships is tied for most ever. 2. Larry Bird was a fucking monster. 3. Jayson Tatum is a 23 year old superstar and Jaylen Brown is pretty damn good himself.  4. Bill Russell can‚Äôt fit all of his rings on two hands.  5. Tacko Fall
Would you guys think Tacko Fall is top 20 tallest people in the world? Top 10?
Imagine if Tacko Fall and Omos in WWE formed a tag team
Tacko Fall left hanging
shoulda gave tacko fall the start over semi ojeleye
"He might be one of the worst lottery picks in recent history. He was Tacko Fall before Tacko Fall with far less upside. That 2009 draft class had some all time greats and solid players in it. Unfortunately, it also had some players who were busts and clearly not prepared to play in the league."
"Tacko Fall had a +/- of like - 24,000 in the playoffs when adjusted for 48 mins"
Imagine thinking Tacko Fall has been effective...
"What, you mean you didn't want to sign Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall to max contracts?"
Tends to happen when u don't play Tacko Fall to compensate for the scrubs smh smh
"The easiest way to put it is that Bol Bol and Tacko Fall would both be starting in the 90s. Not on competing teams or anything, but still starting."
Do you think 7‚Äù6 Tacko Fall couldn‚Äôt dunk on a 13 foot rim if he wanted to?
He looks so fucking ugly that I can‚Äôt stand watching him. Even tacko fall is easier on the eyes
"""How many picks do you want for Tacko Fall?"""
Giannis ‚ÄúTacko Fall‚Äù Antetokounmpo
If I‚Äôm any team in the NBA this off season I‚Äôm trading whoever I need to for Facu and Tacko Fall on the same roster.  The shortness and tallness would even out and you‚Äôre looking at the backbone of your next championship team
Both will give him more trouble than fondue tacko fall
"Purple link to bbref... weird coincidence, I looked him up for the first time right before this game. Somebody had mentioned him in an article on best 7'4""+ dudes, in a similar manner as this redditor: throwing his name in, quasi-seriously, with no elaboration.  Turns out Chuck Nevitt is basically Tacko Fall, and from clips I'm inclined to think Tacko is a little bit closer to being NBA-ready than Chuck Nevitt ever was. And they nicknamed him Human Victory Cigar, too."
In part because he's giant. See: Tacko Fall meme fandom.  In part because he seems like a really chill dude.
"One of the current tag team title holders in WWE can't wrestle, can't talk, and has no charisma. His only redeeming quality is that he looks like a cross between Tacko Fall and Mark Henry. Bhullar could do that."
Active nba players 7'3 and above include  Tacko Fall  Boban Marjanovic  Kristaps Porzingis  Kristaps' handles is clearly much better than the other 2 but that's not much of a compliment
"Both Boban and Tacko Fall have ridiculous handles for their size. Honestly they are better with the ball than Steph and Dame. For some reason their coaches refuse to put them in positions to highlight their strengths though.   I‚Äôve never understood why their coaches don‚Äôt run them at the point. They both have the lateral quickness and athleticism to defend the Dame and Kyrie types out there. They are both deadly 3 point snipers. Unbelievable court vision and always make the right pass to find the open guy. They can score at will. Defend. Block shots. Rebound. Start and finish a fast break by themselves.   If I‚Äôm the Seattle expansion team I‚Äôm getting Boban, Tacko and a bunch of shooters like Bol Bol. League fucked."
Tacko Fall. Nobody dislikes him.
"Okay, this is actually pretty funny. If someone is Tacko Fall or Bol Bol height then they are around 6‚Äù taller than someone that‚Äôs 6‚Äô10‚Äù, which is 6‚Äù taller than 6‚Äô4‚Äù. The difference from tall to very tall is bigger than very tall to super tall. Just found that a bit humorous."
"Nobody is pulling out a ruler, tall is tall unless you're built like Tacko Fall or Bol Bol, and also that percentilage is global, not nation-wide, state-wide, or city-wide. If I saw someone 6'8"" at the gas station I would think ""oh that guy's tall"" but I've seen people that tall before."
TBH a guy who is 8 foot tall is probably worth a flier if he has any ability at all just in the hopes that he can develop. That kind of length for defense is insane. Tacko Fall went in the 2nd round for a similar reason.
But what does Tacko Fall think?
Who needs KP when we have Tacko Fall üòé
Tacko Fall back to back MVP
I have a friend who's a celtics fan and I always tell him Brad needs to put in MVP Tacko Fall
"Yeah to be fair that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs played six total minutes in three losses these playoffs.   He‚Äôs played the 223rd least minutes per game out of 230 players, beating out only Keljin Blevins, Tolliver, Amir Coffey, Rayjon Tucker, Yogi Ferrell, Frank Ntilikina, and Tacko Fall. That can kind of mess with the usage percentage - Rayjon Tucker is 8th for example"
"So, he‚Äôs the Tacko Fall of Denver"
"Nah man Barron built like Tacko Fall, he should be balling"
Let's compromise and call it Tacko Fall
"Look at Yao's frame. Yao was 310 at 7'6"". Porzingis is 240 at 7'3"". Tacko Fall is 7'5"" and 311.       So you've got big dudes like Tacko and Yao with actual decent frames and then tiny ass Porzingis at just 240 at 7'3"". Porzingis is 7"" taller than Julius Randle and weighs 10lbs less lmao"
NOBODY puts Tacko fall in the corner!
Tacko Fall has entered the chat
"The thing is he's still a good shooter with great range, but he's so slow that I'm not even sure that they can even run shooting sets for him. And teams can just switch any screens with him with 0 consequences. Like he could get Tacko Fall or Isaiah Thomas on him and the result would still be a 40% mid range shot"
Throw in Tacko Fall so the Mavs can have all the height
dude you have a taller guy on your team who barely plays at all  how is KP more of a waste of height than 7'5 tacko fall
"i think you're expectations may have been skewed to begin with. boban hardly ever looked ready for real reliable NBA minutes, and he looked pretty damn good much of the time for what his body is capable of. he's not just a big man, he has a growth hormone disorder. his touch around the rim is better than what many expected i think, and he seems like he's learning the game better and better. KP is the real disappointment. who would be surprised if boban was more in the tacko fall and bol bol category? he's earned his real minutes"
Tacko Fall though
tacko fall is their favorite
You mean Celtics legend Tacko Fall
You gotta give the fans some fan service if you're losing. That's why Boston has Tacko Fall
Tacko Fall vs Bol Bol
OR MICHAEL JORDAN OR CHRIS DUDLEY OR TACKO FALL
Lebron for Tacko Fall
And yet 98% of the players find it within themselves to dap each other up. It always happens at the end of playoff series. I don't care if you're Lebron James or Tacko Fall. Lebron needs to quit the being dramatic card and man up.
"No, but neither are posts about Malachi Flynn or tacko fall.  Most mediocre rookies get hyped to a certain degree. This is the sixers hyping theirs."
Tacko Fall.
Tacko Fall is the tallest ACTIVE player? Using the word active loosely I see.
Pick up Tacko Fall and run Porzingis at the 3
"a rookie coming in and making a playoffs game his own for a good stretch and keeping the momentum going with the bench unit, while our MVP player is out. He's also a big fan favourite. He helped seal the series. I've seen enough posts about a chant that started for tacko fall. I feel like this passes the thresshold.   So yeah, i'd say its worth posting."
Tacko Fall is getting sent to the Magic and prob Caruso too
"Fuck it, who needs Jaylen when they can take Tacko Fall"
Tacko Fall
D'Antoni gonna create personnel. Tacko Fall about to average 12 3PA per game.
Ironman Tacko Fall better than all those ***bums*** anyways. He needs the max.
All that just to beat Tacko Fall
Yeah we have Luke Kornet. He usually backs up Robert Williams. Thompson can also play the 5 and of course there still is Tacko Fall as well.
"Brad Stevens never once started THE INTIMIDATOR Tacko Fall! Poor coaching, but a worse roster!"
tacko fall
"Considering 2 of our top 3 scorers are out and Tatum has been going nuts the past 2 games, I don‚Äôt know who you expect to do that. Evan Fournier, I guess? Or is Tacko Fall going to have a breakout game?"
"I just don't like that players team up and screw over their current fanbases so they can play together and get a ring.  The rest of it is wildly over the top because the average NBA player has no leverage.  20 guys tops do.  2 or 3 of those 20 together can win a championship, what they decide determines whole franchises; no matter how good or bad they've managed things.  I care about fans, and that's not good for them.  The rest of it is petty millionaires (again the top 20 players) vs billionaires arguing.  Fabio Campazzo or Tacko Fall don't have any power, the 'empowered' players are only about 15 deep."
Tacko Fall

I would pay good money to see a Bol Bol-Tacko Fall one-on-one game.
The only correct answer is **Tacko Fall.**
"What if the lakers had tacko fall, do the lakers get better or worse"
The memes that would fly after [insert player who had season worthy of MVP here] gets less votes for MVP than Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall
can't wait for Tacko fall to win the 2025 MVP

It was a reference to Tacko Fall being called Taco Bell on accident the other night
Omg that tacko fall joke was so damn corny. Come on Jeff
Noted white people Bol Bol and Tacko Fall
Why is Tacko Fall not showing up on the roster?
Sound the Tacko Fall klaxon
"Teams sit players who don't help their team all the time, don't usually sit players who help their team. That's why if you watch this game tonight you'll see a lot more Jayson Tatum than Tacko Fall."
1. Tacko Fall  That's all we need.
"Tacko Fall has a triple double, or I‚Äôm rooting for the Wizards."

Tacko Fall
"&gt;Injured Boston team that‚Äôs locked into their seed  Never count out Tacko ""Quadruple Double Machine"" Fall"
"how the fuck was this game close, we played Tacko Fall 16 minutes"
How do you have bol bol but not tacko fall smh
The disrespect for Tacko Fall
Top 5 I guess  1. Alex Caruso  2. Dort 3. Poku 4. Tacko Fall 5. Giannis
"Even if he was ‚Äúmade in lab‚Äù which is ridiculous. The lab didn‚Äôt give him his shooting touch, post moves, playmaking, or passing skills. He had to work to get that. Even if he was bred to be tall, he wasn‚Äôt guaranteed to be an NBA star. Look at Shawn Bradley, Tacko Fall. Height is not a guarantee of anything other than opportunity. This whole made in a lab thing just discredits the insane about of work that Yao, a human being, put into his game"
"Just add Tacko Fall at this point. If you want to beat MOST of the countries, it‚Äôs a good strategy"
Isn't Tacko Fall on on a 2-way? and it's not just about height.. they need to know how to play. Most of the good centers are not actually American.
"If it's about height, then why not get like Tacko Fall or some other younger guy taller than McGee, especially since McGee's knees cant be great at his age anymore. This pick doesnt make sense, compared to like a hundred other better ones!"
Tacko Fall? Bol Bol? White Mamba? James Hardens Fatsuit? Smh if you wanted to say you‚Äôre a casual you could‚Äôve just told us.
"No.  I'd like for the refs to be better, and I'd like for the balance of calls between the perimeter and the inside changes.  But the 3 second rules is good, I don't want to watch Tacko Fall suddenly being valuable just because he's born tall. Same for the goal tending rule"
keep your eyes on bol bol and tacko fall üî•
Tacko Fall
"Anfernee Simons will turn into Anfernee Penny Hardaway, he will grow 4 inches and also become good at defense, Dame will turn into Tacko Fall and Nurk will be 5'11. Portland goes undefeated and Eric Bledsoe will drop 55 on the bucks in the finals to win in 4.    Those are my BOLD predictions."
And Tacko Fall A+++
Tacko Fall is one of the best ballerinas in the league from what I‚Äôve heard.
"Do you remember Tor-Bos G3 in 2020 bubble playoffs?  [They brought in Tacko Fall to guard the inbounds.](https://youtu.be/t0aLmBCXoqA)  OG hit the 3 anyways.  Also there is no way to test any theories with this, its not like we can re-play a game from its last possession and test things out."
"Skill is what Embiid, Shaq, Dwight, AD have all Giannis does is run, dunk, attempt a 20 second free throw. Not many people can do that, Giannis does have the strength and speed to do that unlike someone as trash as Tacko Fall, but that‚Äôs literally all Giannis has."
"If you're 7 feet tall, you can just run and dunk and it takes no skill. That's why Tacko Fall is putting up the same numbers as Giannis."
"Nobody else has Tacko Fall so I‚Äôm gonna go with us, totally no bias"
"IF Tacko Fall gets to play 38 mins per game, I take him. Otherwise Luka or Dort"
gimme tacko fall with curry shooting
our best player is tacko fall
Tacko Fall probably wins most of these
Fuck no  Swap TT for ~~the Nets pick~~ Tacko Fall and we'll consider it
I think that is only true in the pre-analytics era. These days everyone would employ the brilliant hack-a-shaq tactic and he would be an end-of-bench player.  He would literally just be a fatter tacko fall.
Hm... you want guys like Tacko Fall to just camp under the rim and block shots?
Only guy slower is Tacko Fall
Tortilla breaks down after Tacko Fall
"The players I named are basically never being flamed by casual fans (except Luka, he‚Äôs probably too big a star to be universally loved anymore). When I say universally beloved I mean having a lot of fans and having few haters. If you think the ratio of LeBron or KD lovers to haters is higher than that of, say, Tacko Fall- I cant see how that‚Äôs possible."
Celtics would commit flagrant fouls on purpose and stick Tacko Fall in there
Ikr...  I never understood this stupid comparison...  Its like comparing Hakeem to Tacko fall
Tacko Fall moved to senegal when he was 2 years old. Born in Nigeria üá≥üá¨.
"His family is from Nigeria. Tacko Fall is from Senegral. It's not the same country let alone the same city.  But sure keep insulting me because you can't grasp that two places 1,000 miles apart aren't the same city or even country."
That's right I forgot he was Muslim. Him and Tacko Fall I believe are from the same city.

Tacko fall for Dame and picks
Tacko Fall. He is just a big mascot.
Tacko Fall approves this
Tacko Fall
Do you think when Tacko Fall retires he‚Äôd use his career earnings to build a personal Tacko Fall sized theme park?
Tacko Fall vs Bol Bol
Tacko Fall
"This is unlikely to ever happen, but what if this play happens, and neither Ayton or Zubac touch the ball, but it goes into the hoop (at this point it‚Äôs no basket for sure), but Tacko Fall is in the game and happens to be standing underneath the basket and it bounces off his head up through the hoop, before going back down. Would the basket count?"
Tacko Fall could really exploit this loophole.
"that was over Tacko Fall, too"
Do it for Tacko Fall
You‚Äôd get weird donnies like Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall in there.  Fan votes are almost never a good idea.
The disrespect to Tacko Fall
"Holy shit dude that's insane you can be like our tacko fall, and if we ever get. 5'11 3/4 he can be our manute"
Tacko Fall averaged better from the line all 4 years of college and he has to catapult it. Fucking abysmal.
We'll give them Tacko Fall for Rudy Gobert
I believe Tacko Fall feels the same way. I read he would rather be an engineer or something
We‚Äôll give you Ben for Jokic.  Celtics will get Tobias for Horford and Tacko Fall.    Tall boi lineup part 2
Carlisle's gonna have Tacko Fall shooting 3's if he goes to the Celtics.
They have a new standard of height in Tacko Fall
yall forget about tacko fall :/
Wait. So Boston now have: TimeLord TT Al Horford Moses Brown and... Tacko Fall? That's a lot of Bigs.
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players‚Äô number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"Moses brown is nothing more than a project player. He is closer to Tacko fall in terms of ability.  He undeniably cares and puts all his effort into the game. Unless this trade changes him I don't think Celtics fans will ever think he doesn't care.   Unfortunately, that doesn't mean he's good. He will rebound and score open looks, but he is also very poor defensively on anything not one on one coverage.   Definitely a end of the bench guy. He's a piece you put in the trade to have another piece in the trade and it wouldn't really suprise me if this was his only contract in the nba."
so is tacko fall
"you will get called for a foul. and also, nobody has arms that long, not even Tacko Fall. you can't contest that its impossible to do it if the guy does the Dirk."
Tacko Fall - He's a taco
Trae young is already young   Tacko fall would be a season  Blake Griffin would be fucking insane to see
"Seriously I clicked the other two, they were alright. Clicked Tacko wondering ""will it be about Tacko or Fall?"".... Brilliant."
tacko fall was superb
Tacko Fall is astounding bravo
Fred VanVleet - i.imgur.com/KPy6Fy1.png  Tacko Fall - i.imgur.com/FFmqot7.png  Jamario Moon - i.imgur.com/nAseoiF.png  Idk why the links don‚Äôt work on mobile but just copy paste
Why have I only seen this tacko fall guy getting dunked on? By like 2 other players.
"Forward: Klay Thompson + Tacko Fall, spot up shooting with that height would break the game. Guard: Simmons + Steph. Center: KAT + Dray"
I‚Äôd be the same as tacko fall
How do you not have Tacko Fall or Boban  on your team?
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
"Tacko Fall, Boban Marjanovic, Bol Bol, Luke Kornet, and Kristaps Porzingis. Not a single player below 7‚Äô2."
"I‚Äôm really talking about players that mostly get garbage time minutes that everyone loves, like tacko fall"
Tacko Fall almost beat that Duke team with Zion RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish though.
"This is my thought as well - could a relatively weak player skills-wise, but dominant physically, be all it takes? Most NCAA 4s and 5s aren't going to be able to keep up with NBA size.     That said, there's definitely skill involved - Tacko Fall is huge, but UCF only got 1 win at March Madness in 2019."
Tacko Fall is really fast at least?
"Money. You‚Äôre never going to make as much on endorsements in okc or even San Antonio than you would in LA NY Miami etc. big market teams have big market money, massive fanbases and a lot of revenue can come through. I mean really Kyle kuzma Alex caruso and fucking tacko fall were in the all star charts. Even Anthony Davis who basically got fucked previous years simply because New Orleans existed. You get a ton more exposure and ability for endorsements being the 2nd 3rd or 4th best on a big market team compared to say idk Minnesota. They aren‚Äôt bad places but to maximize profits you‚Äôre damn sure not gonna want to be in Toronto if you aren‚Äôt super max worthy"
"_After a prolonged bidding war, Tacko Fall has agreed to sign for 4-years, 150-million dollars._"
"If Tacko slips, Tacko Fall."

If you're putting Caruso then you definitely add Tacko fall and Boban Marjanoviƒá to the likable bench
"Yeah, that‚Äôs how they got the 30th, from the Suns in trading Baynes away in order to sign Kemba. Suns got that pick for Bledsoe.   It was for sure a waste to get rid of the 30th pick, but the previous GM did not want to have too many rookies at once.   In 2019 Danny Ainge collected too many young  players (14th pick Romeo, 20 Grant Williams, 33 Carsen Edwards, 51 Waters, undrafted Tacko Fall).   In 2020 Danny had 4 picks again; 14, 26, 30, 47. He said he didn‚Äôt want three rookies, so he took Nesmith and Pritchard with the first two, dumped the 30th for 2 seconds, and used the 47th on a stash in Yam Madar.   Brad Stevens took over from Danny in 21 and it seems he is interested in doing some different things, primarily getting rid of bad contracts and aiming to get some experienced role playing vets to help the Jays.   All these moves are wasteful but at least the roster is a little more focused with a clear hierarchy which the team has missed for a while."
It was really awesome. Not many more weird role player chants anymore these days outside of tacko fall who will never be close to Antonio Davis skill wise (all star)
"They robbed Tacko Fall of being the third 7'7"" player in NBA history during it."
But in that case literally everyone is smaller when they enter the NBA. Even Tacko Fall has less of a height advantage from college -&gt; NBA.
"Not only can you do this, but since theres no defensive 3 seconds, you could just park Tacko Fall in the paint all game and just have him bat any ball of the rim. Absolutely absurd that this still is a thing, even in FIBA."
this might be the most stupid comment i‚Äôve ever seen. how can you say HOF lineup and not include tacko fall?
Tacko Fall about to make $100 mill.
Tacko Fall suddenly becomes OP free throw defender
"Moustapha might not be related to Tacko, but I just discovered that one of Tacko's teammates in Senegal was a guy named Youssoupha Fall, also 7 ft tall. Youssoupha and Moustapha have to be related."
"Australian commentator just now"" there is another Fall in NBA, Tacko Fall, same size, don't believe they are relative"""
"After some research, Moustapha Fall and Tacko Fall are not related."
"He absolutely should get the stat counted, but he also shouldnt be seen as some great offensive rebounder for it. Im sure there are lots of tall players who could just go up and down 10 times in a row bouncing the ball off the backboard not trying to make a shot. Would Tacko Fall be the best rebounder in the league if he did this 5 times a game?   That rebound is 10x easier to earn than a normal play rebound situation because youre already in position and cant get boxed out like if you had to close into the rim. Getting your own rebound under the rim is BY FAR the easiest offensive rebound."
I see three of the greatest players of all time on that list‚Ä¶.  Darko Millicic   Tacko Fall  And the OG Homie‚Ä¶Double G! George Glamack!
Had zero idea tacko fall was French.
"In a return to the court, Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz collide and suffer a rare double acl injury.   Using the injured player exception, the Magic sign former assists leader Shelving Mack and local legend Tacko Fall  (Ok the last part would be fine, I was just thinking about the longest player available)"
Thought that was Tacko Fall on the court for a second lmao
"Naw Tacko Fall is 3, Gobert top 3 big man fo sho tho"
"Yes, I am. The point is that DeRozan's playoff plus-minus is not indicative of the player he is, because it's a total stat, and because it's a first-gen advanced stat.  The totals part takes it out of context. Looking at even advanced stats when the contexts are very different isn't really that meaningful.  To demonstrate that I pointed out that if you don't put a limit on context, you could look at PER only and say oh look Jamal Crawford was robbed of MVP and the people voting Tacko Fall for the ASG weren't just doing it as a meme."
Doesn‚Äôt tacko fall have the longest wingspan in the league?
Can the Raptors sign Tacko Fall as their C?
Tacko Fall
"Would you care if someone showed the best players in 2019-2020 by PER but included people who didn't have the minutes qualification and then said that based on that that it wouldn't be ludicrous for the all-NBA First Team to be Shamorie Ponds, Jamal Crawford, Max Strus, Jonathan Motley, and Tacko Fall?? All with 28+ PER!!!!  Hell, even just among qualified players, Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond made it into the top 20."
Bro we just lost to store brand Tacko Fall.
Hows tacko fall @celtics fans?
You forgot tacko fall
Where will Tacko Fall land?
"Tacko fall to raptors, beginning the big man line up of toronto: fall, birch, boucher, barnes, siakam"
"Best I can do is Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, and S&amp;T Fournier."
Still can‚Äôt believe we watched a guy fall for a mid range shot fake 20 feet from the basket. Like if tacko wants to shoot that you don‚Äôt even put a hand up Lmaooooooo
"the heat have been linked with every free agent, even fucking tacko fall Lmfao"
Tacko Fall 3yr/$50mil
The Fall of Tacko
I really hope Tacko Fall does a re-signation with us. Thanks for the clarification!
Tacko Fall baby - embrace the memes   But you're right you all need a decent third stringer especially considering Timelord's conditioning woes
"yeeeeah you right, I actually meant less-than-5-minutes. ie, garbage time, Tacko Fall style minutes"
Tacko Fall. No dribbling--just pass the ball downcourt over everyone else's head and dunk. Zone D.
"Same here, someone wanted to trade me Buddy Hield for Giannis. So I picked up Tacko Fall and sent him Tacko for Fox."
Team USA bench should cheer and scream when Tatum makes a bucket. Just like when Tacko Fall comes into the game and makes a bucket in garbage time.
I don‚Äôt know about NFL but in the nba there are a ton of player on 2-way contracts making less than $100K a year. Heck Tacko Fall was making $77K even though the minimum wage in the nba is roughly $500K per year. So there are a lot players making less than the so-called minimum
tacko fall was never an all star tho
Reminds me of Tacko Fall making a free throw
He eating Takoyaki the size of Tacko Fall
I refuse to believe that Moustapha and Tacko Fall are not related.
Tacko Fall
there's FALL and TACKO FALL
This Mustafa Fall guy is a straight up better version of Tacko. How is he not in the NBA
GORDON DIDN'T DUNK OVER TACKO FALL.  Watch the fucking dunk again bro.  Tacko Fall bends down like 2 feet to let Gordon get over him.  Such a stupid dunk.
Remember when he awarded the dunk contest to his boy Derrick Jones over Aaron Gordon last year? After Gordon dunked over tacko fall?
You‚Äôre friends with Tacko Fall?
Everyone saw Tacko Fall expose him. Bamba will never be the same !
do we necessarily want traditional centers to be more useful?  I honestly don‚Äôt think i wanna watch basketball with Tacko Fall just standing with his hands up in front of the rim all game.
I think Tacko Fall is the definition of MVB
Tacko fall
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
We all know Tacko Fall is the most untradable asset in NBA history /s
Tacko Fall. Duh.
imagined the guy having crazy Tacko Fall arms that comes down to his shins. Might belong in a circus more than the NBA.
Ok? By that logic any player can win a championship in any position. Can tacko fall be a championship sg? Can Isaiah Thomas be a championship center? Yes and yes if they are at the end of the bench sitting through playoff games
"That's the secret reason we've been stockpiling taller players. Tacko Fall, Lauri Markkanen, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen are about to feast."
"Why doesn‚Äôt Tacko Fall, the largest of the Cavs, simply eat Kevin Love?"
We lost Tacko Fall
"PG: LeBron James (SS) SG: Brad Beal (AS) SF: Kevin Durant (SS) PF: Jayson Tatum (AS) C: Rob Williams  6-12 FVV, Seth Curry, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis, Tacko Fall"
Gotta be Tacko Fall currently. But all time it's gotta be either Manute Bol or Gheorghe Muresan
Bones can actually get to a point where they can't support their own weight and will crumble. A lot of people with genetic conditions affecting growth have problems with bone strength. That was the main concern around Tacko Fall when he was drafted.
Yep‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always felt bad for dudes like Tacko Fall and happy when they have at least some success in NBA  The world is just simply not made for people that size.
"Yea but that's not athleticism, that's skill and feel for the game. If you put Usain Bolt on a court he would technically be the most athletic dude, but of course that's not gonna translate in a basketball game because he lacks the skill to be effective.  If I can jump high but can't get blocks, it's not that I lack functional athleticism, it's that I lack defensive IQ and timing. If I sprint fast without a ball, but slow dribbling it, I lack ball handling.  Functional athleticism is such a dumb way to look at it. It's like saying Tacko Fall lacks functional height because he's a bum"
Tacko Fall would get a pretty big bag.
"Boban, dort, sga, tacko fall, Kenneth faried, joe ingles maybe?"
Tacko Fall
Tacko Fall?
Tacko Fall will be there.
"Tacko Fall &gt; Khyri Thomas  There, I said it."
"I'm actually steering into the skid on this one: the Ben Simmons slander hasn't gone *far enough*.  He happily signed a max deal in Philly to be their franchise guy and hasn't worked on or improved his game at all since coming into the league.  He wants all the credit &amp; benefits of being a franchise guy but isn't willing to do what it takes to earn that.  With great power comes great responsibility.  If Ben was getting paid Tacko Fall money, nobody would give a shit that he's extremely fragile and has serious limitations, but he isn't so he rightfully gets held to a different standard.  It's not unreasonable for fans &amp; media members to expect NBA players to work hard, doubly so for ""franchise cornerstones.""  Ben can't have it both ways, if he wants to be a ""young socialite"" in a major media market then he has to deal with the scrutiny that comes with that.  If he wants to be loved &amp; coddled and have a team just be happy to have him for who he is, then go to fucking Sacramento, Portland, Minneapolis or somewhere like that (no shots at those cities, typically the media in small markets are less intense).     The way he handles himself &amp; approaches his craft is laughable, and it shows on the court where he spends more time standing flat-footed as a giant, sucking negative than he does doing anything impactful on the court.  People want to say that he could be like Draymond Green which is insanely fucking disrespectful to Draymond Green.  Dray may not shoot a lot (but he IS willing to take them when he needs to), but that dude cuts, screens, scraps and fights for everything and worked his ass off to maximize his abilities.  Draymond is always locked in and is useful in the half-court, Ben Simmons doesn't do anything except stand in the dunker's spot (or out of bounds) and his effort &amp; focus fluctuates wildly.  Miss me with Ben Simmons, I've said it before &amp; will say it again: I wouldn't trade Marcus Smart for him straight up.  Ben Simmons is the most overrated player in the NBA bar none."
"Just think that say, for example, the Cavs should have a guy like Jeremy Lin/Bismack Biyombo/John Henson to mentor either SexLand or Mobley/Markkanen/Allen instead of Denzel Valentine and Tacko Fall, you feel me?"
"PRECISELY lol. And yeah its one thing for big ol' kawhi to get wedged into a picture. I'm 6'6, i know that feeling. But these two dudes are like maybe 6' and its looking up at them like a dwarf looking at tacko fall"
"&gt; Tacko Fall, currently with the Boston Celtics, is the tallest active NBA player on this list. Dallas Mavericks‚Äò Boban Marjanovic is the only active player on the list.  top notch journalism"
Tacko Fall.
thon was a meme like tacko fall. how did u rly expect anything from him
"Lol? Tacko Fall maybe, but the other two can't even make the league."
"Available right now, who could put in minutes at C more usefully than the husk of DeAndre Jordan?  Tacko Fall, Isaiah Hartenstein, Thon Maker - but wait, they're young and have potential to get better, rather than being old and declining, the Lakers don't do that now."
no kidding. Everyone knows that should be talking u Tacko Fall. Lebron is just a boomer.
"Kemba Walker is in NY now. Imma be honest though, I only know Jabari Parker and Tacko Fall.  What I meant was that ever since you guys had that great season with Kyrie sidelined we were all expecting the young team to get even better and start contending for best in the East. Tatum and Brown have gotten better but the team got worse. Just can't figure out why that is"
"Bunch of rookies, sophomore and 3rd year player on our bench last season. Now we have a decent bench. Semi Ojeleye, Recovering Langford, Rookie Neismith, Sophomore Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters (both under 6 feet), Jabari Parker, Washed TT, White guy from the bulls and Tacko Fall. Oh I forgot Kemba in and out Walker. Did you even know those guys? Lmfaoo"
Sign Tacko Fall.
Giannis with average shooting = GOAT  Bol Bol with average strength = all NBA  Tacko Fall with average speed = all star  Steph Curry with average height = GOAT  Chris Paul with average height = GOAT Contender
~~PG: Simmons~~   PG: Tacko Fall
My man Tacko Fall will be missed.. much love wishing him all the best. Hope they got good Enchiladas
Tacko Fall vs AD in a few years
"[Marcus Smart](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments) talked about it a few months ago. I know you're being sarcastic, but unfortunately yes, Boston is racist as shit and the players know it. [Bill Russell](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2899150-bill-russell-fans-called-me-baboon-coon-n-word-during-celtics-games) knew it, too. [Boston racism in basketball](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/02/29/celtics-discuss-racial-dynamics-still-play-boston/) is honestly a pretty popular topic that seems to keep coming up all the time. Same as Utah.   Honestly your comment reeks of ""But I have a black friend"" energy. You're saying that Boston was nice to one black guy, so how could they be racist? I bet Tacko Fall and any other black player would be able to explain to you all about it."
"Manute Bol, George Muresan, Shawn Bradley, Tacko Fall, mugsy"
"""The Celtics would have won if there were fans!"" Is probably the worst take I've ever seen on this sub.  You got got by a crazy shot, no need for excuses.  Maybe if Tacko Fall was 7'6 the game would have been different."
Tacko Fall.

Cleveland Cavaliers legend Tacko Fall
Yeah like Tacko Fall? Lol there is a definite shortage of quality bigs.
Tacko Fall signed with the Cavs?
I want to add Tacko Fall for all-time flopping name.
Tacko Fall PG. I wanna see it!
Wait when did they sign Tacko Fall
Tacko Fall is a top 10 PG. Change my mind.
Tacko fall at point guard is this a joke?
"Slavko Vranes, Pavel Podkolzin, Hasheem Thabeet, Walter Tavares, Chuck Nevitt, Sim Bhullar, Priest Lauderdale, Hamed Haddadi, Aleks Radojevic, PJ Ramos, Keith Closs, ...Tacko Fall  All hail the giant stiff, may you forever average 4 and 3 with 2 blocks."
Tacko Fall would be utterly unstoppable to normal-size hoopers lol

"What do Thon Maker, Bol Bol, and Tacko Fall have in common?"
"In terms of official listed weight (in other words, don't @ me about Oliver Miller, Eddy Curry, Tractor Traylor, etc.), the greatest disparity between two teammates that I can find is Sim Bhullar at 360 lbs. and Darren Collison at 175 lbs., a difference of 185 lbs. (Though David Stockton played on the Kings in 2015, Bhullar was sent down as Stockton was brought up.)  Other instances of one teammate weighing about double another (only one listed per player) include, but are not limited to:  * Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Melchioni (310 lbs. and 165 lbs.) * Thomas Hamilton (330 lbs.) and Dee Brown (160 lbs.) * Gheorghe Muresan (303 lbs.) and Greg Grant (140 lbs.) * Yao Ming (311 lbs.) and John Lucas III (166 lbs.) * Shaquille O'Neal (325 lbs.) and Steve Kerr &amp; Kenny Smith (170 lbs.) \[Shaq and Sebastian Telfair, 165, were in the same trade, making them the biggest disparity in a trade.\] * Garth Joseph (315 lbs.) and Muggsy Bogues (136 lbs.) * For the last 2 seasons, the greatest disparity was Tacko Fall (311 lbs.) and Tremont Waters (136 lbs.) * Oliver Miller (280 lbs.) and Elliot Perry (150 lbs.) * Mike Peplowski (270 lbs.) and Spud Webb (133 lbs.)"
How can you make this and not include Tacko Fall? He could be a waterfall of tacos. How dare you.

Tacko Fall is signed and ready.
My extremely humble take is that we might be the best team in the NBA. We can go bigger if we start using Tacko Fall as our SG.
"The Pelicans gave us Boogie and AD, so we need to get that Tacko Fall and Bol Bol duo."
Their starting five could be: PG-Simmons SG-Pokusevski SF-Bol Bol PF-Krystaps Porzingis C-Tacko Fall
Toss in tacko fall.  Then a TacopokuBowl.  That would be the meme Dream Team
"I feel bad for Bol. He gets treated like a novelty, kinda like Tacko Fall. I think it makes him feel he is a lot better than he really is.  It might be a hard reality for him to accept.  He is somewhere between being a 9th-12th man on the NBA bench or playing overseas and being a star."
Tacko Fall and Kyrie Irving have the same amount of points
"you're right, trade him for tacko fall, he's trash"
UNLEASH TACKO FALL AND BOL BOL
143-28  Tacko Fall with a Quintuple-Quintuple
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
Tacko Fall
Celtics failed Tacko Fall
"I wouldn't feel bad.  It's not a Scalabrine situation where they're ironically chanting.  I think it's more Bulls fans genuinely loving Caruso because he's actually a solid NBA player and not some meme bench garbage time fan favorite that his reputation started off as (ala Tacko Fall, Bruno Caboclo, etc.)  Caruso should be taking these chants as endearing."
"That's how I always feel about how a lot of fans treat Boban and Tacko Fall, but it's much worse. A lot of fans say they love them, but then treat them like mascots rather than people."
*And in a bizarre move the DogeCoin Suns have traded Devin Booker for Tacko Fall and Screech from Saved by the Bell*
Tacko Fall is on the Cavs now? Nice.
You just know Tacko Fall and Boban would be locks to make the roster
"i think that's more because that kind of energy is contagious, but it doesn't translate to actual depth of feeling.  it's like a meme.  i guess it's been good for guys like caruso and tacko fall (while not affecting FOs opinions too much) and negative for PG13, but paul george is still on a max on a great team and got his props when he did well in the playoffs last season so it hasn't had a effect of him professionally, either."
"Let‚Äôs put it into perspective  - Last season Zion was the 5th heaviest player in the NBA at 284lbs. The number one knock on him was his weight (which translates to injury concerns)  - The four players with a higher weight than Zion were 6‚Äô11, 6‚Äô11, 7‚Äô4, and 7‚Äô5.   - If this report is true, it would move Zion above Marjanovic, Nurkic, and Jokic to 2nd heaviest player in the league behind only 7‚Äô5‚Äù Tacko Fall.    It‚Äôs really really bad"
I can‚Äôt believe Tacko Fall is 311 pounds
"i can see tacko fall being one in the future, as well as matisse thybule   right now‚Ä¶ dwight powell, larry nance jr, also lance stephenson if he were still in the nba i think would classify as a mid but rotation  gerry payton recently, not at the beginning"
I wanna see Yuki next to Tacko Fall
"Boban probably weighs more (Tacko Fall too), but he's not fatter. They are both like 9-10"" taller than Zion. I'm fairly sure Zion has the highest body fat % in the league right now."
Tacko Fall also isn‚Äôt a sumo wrestler.
Tacko Fall
Tacko fall
"Did you see Tacko Fall's (I think it's him) per 36 numbers? Tacko Bell Fall&gt;LeBron, MJ, Wilt..."
We need the NBA PLAYERS REACT video!   The man is doing this at 7‚Äô2 with a 7‚Äô8 wingspan (longer than Tacko Fall)
Yeah and if Tacko Fall averaged 50 ppg with 15 assists 30 rebounds and 15 blocks a game he would probably be the undisputed goat in my eyes. Not even being hyperbolic
PG: Kevin Love  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Evan Mobley  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Tacko Fall
Taco Tuesday on a two way with Tacko Fall.
"The Cleveland Cavaliers and center Tacko Fall agreed to a two-way contract Saturday.  [Shams Charania](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1449397306713911298)¬†of The Athletic and Stadium reported Fall nabbed the contract with strong play during training camp. The 7'5"" big man was solid in limited minutes, including an eight-point, five-rebound effort in the Cavs' preseason finale against the Indiana Pacers"
no he is the only center.   love-Markkanen-Evan Mobley-jared allen-tacko fall  this is the starting 5.
Alex Caruso seems to fall in the same category as Tacko Fall in terms of people getting excited about them even though they'll never really be more than small role players.
"Yeah, in all honesty there are probably like 1000+ guys who could reasonably be the worst player in the NBA (ie the 450th best player in the NBA). There are a ton of different reasons why a team might decide on one of those random pool of 1000 players, raw potential (perhaps a foreign player who only started playing), great showing in NCAA tournament (Peyton Siva type guy), viral sensation (like Mac McClung), physical body (Tacko Fall), or if they have connections to the league (LiAngelo, Thanasis, maybe Shareef O‚ÄôNeal in a few years), good narrative/story (Andre Ingram on the Lakers a few years ago). There are valid reasons to have any of those guys as the 15th man or on a two way contract for any team, it just comes down to what they‚Äôre looking for and what they value. Thanasis being Giannis‚Äô brother helped him get a foot in the door, but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs taking a roster spot away from someone who clearly deserves a spot in the NBA.  There 451st best basketball player in the league isn‚Äôt that different from the 999th best, and when you factor in other things that are even more subjective and harder to project like potential, growth, etc. everything gets so muddied it‚Äôs so hard to know what‚Äôs best."
What do you mean? When Tacko Fall just jumped up and knocked 0.5 seconds off the clock and we won. It was weird how they decided to air another scrimmage afterward but ratings I guess.
"Tacko fall is a comically large man, that is all"
Naz Reid is our Tacko Fall/Bol Bol who suddenly became a legit NBA player and keeps improving. Soon everyone will be aware of him.
"""Philadelphia 76ers have signed Tacko Fall for a human shield role."""
"Tacko Fall is actually two ten year olds, one sitting on the other‚Äôs shoulders."
"Wait, Tacko Fall is on our team now? lol"
I stood by tacko fall a couple times and it was crazy to see someone that tall.
When is Tacko Fall no longer going to be able to dunk...
It gets condescending honestly. Same thing happened with Tacko Fall.   In football (Europe) fans did the same to Ngolo Kante as well albeit not memeing him but infantilising him which became weird real quick.
But now I don‚Äôt think anyone believes he is a star or even a high end starter.  But the pendulum has swung so far the other way that I bet a lot of users here would take Tacko Fall over him
I'll take him on the Cavs. Would fit our tall-ball lineup too:  PG: Bol Bol  SG: Lauri Markkanen  SF: Evan Mobley  PF: Jarrett Allen  C: Tacko Fall
Tacko Fall easy
IIRC Tacko Fall has a CS degree and I think has said he wants to be a software engineer after the NBA
Tacko Fall  Lauri Markkanen  Kevin Love  Evan Mobley  Jarret Allen
No goaltending. Tacko Fall would be greatest goalkeeper of all time.
"No. It‚Äôs up to each individual. Tacko Fall had a 4.0 in high school, high SAT, and majored in CS. The only thing is that the NBA allows you to succeed even if you are an idiot, unlike other career paths."
Tacko Fall is 311 pounds.
"**A Sock-Off.**  A competition to see which player can fit the highest amount of calf-length socks on his feet at one time.  I'm interested in the strategy, and which types of players would excel in this field. Do you want to be tall or short? Built, fat, or thin? I don't know. Maybe Tacko Fall slays the competition? Or would it be Jalen Brunson? Who is to say?"
Shit Tacko Fall would look like MJ out there
"Nah just have tacko fall stand there with his arms up. He doesn‚Äôt have to try to block the shot, but it increases the degree of difficulty."
Not hate but I think it fits. Tacko Fall is like more of a mascot than a player. Half the fan base thinks it‚Äôs great to have a TALL person on a basketball team and the other half are looking at an empty roster spot.
"Cavs fans can definitely support you in that.  We didn't want him to go largely because he can be great at keeping an offense moving with his passing ability.  When you can get your hands on a generational talent like Tacko Fall though, you have to make some sacrifices.  Markkanen, Love, Allen and Mobley also factored in.  The other option was going all in and signing Hartenstein and trading everyone under 6'8"" for Simmons.  You'd have a 5 starting big men all with plus passing ability."
Might lose to Tacko Fall scoring 100

"On the Warriors, yes. The main expectation for him this season is that he'll provide some size. Currently the Warriors sometimes struggle against true bigs.  I think the biggest guy on *any* team right now is either Boban or Tacko Fall."
Tacko Fall against the Raptors game 3 in the bubble. He posted a -3 +/- in 0.5 seconds of gameplay. that's -12960 per 36.
Tacko Fall doing Babysitter's Club cosplay
"This is also my top one.   Honorable mention goes to the OG buzzer beater. It was the 2020 playoffs and thinking that Raptors Celtics series was over with that Theis dunk, then OG winning the game with a ridiculous Lowry lob pass  If Theis didn't dunk so hard it the Raps would have lost that game lol  We also got Tacko Fall with a projected +/- of -17980  or something like that (i forget the actual number)"
"Tacko Fall: bro, give my sweater back!"
Borrowed from Tacko Fall.
Bring in Tacko Fall you cowards
"I'm not doing that though.  I'm just saying it plays a role in why they're more popular, just like any other factor that could possibly go into such a thing.    I'm not saying people here only like Caruso because he's white, I'm saying that they're more inclined to like him because of it.  Just like they're more inclined to like Jokic because he's a gumpy and conventionally graceless-looking dude who's somehow a savant, or  how they like Tacko Fall for his height and silly-sounding name.  It just plays a small role in their outsized popularity along with all the other stuff, that's all.    I think it's worth noting that your list even has a higher % of white people than the league average (50% compared to ~17%), and I know it was just an off-hand list but it's still a bit interesting.  Saying it plays NO factor is the disingenuous argument in my eyes."
"I mean Zach Lowe said the same thing on his podcast and he‚Äôs one of the most objective NBA analysts out there. Whether you agree or not, he‚Äôs still a really good player. And that, along with the other things I mentioned, is why he‚Äôs popular. Not because he‚Äôs white.  We can go down the list of players that have mass followings (Caruso, Jokic, Luka, Herro, SGA, Jordan Poole, Bol Bol, Tacko Fall, Ingles, Lonzo, Dort, Poku etc) and talk about why they‚Äôre so popular. It has nothing to do with being black or white. Each player has legitimate reasons that people love them that have nothing to do with race. Only the truly ignorant would ignore the context of each player and belittle the reasons they are fan favorites by boiling it down to the color of their skin"
"This sub is also infatuated with SGA, Lonzo, Dort, Tacko Fall, Jordan Poole etc.   Stop acting like it‚Äôs only white players. There are just certain players that the masses cling to and there‚Äôs usually a pretty clear reason why, and it has nothing to do with race"
Tacko Fall
"The GOAT conversation is stupid because you can‚Äôt have it in good faith. You can‚Äôt debate MJ supporters at all, they just shut it down with ‚ÄòMJ goat‚Äô. Won‚Äôt even discuss it.   For currently players:  -KD and Curry won‚Äôt get there, haven‚Äôt done enough and are getting to the end of their careers. And for Curry in particular, people are very hesitant to give him his credit (apart from this sub lately lol).  -Can‚Äôt see Giannis game ageing gracefully enough to get him there.  -Lebron; if he isn‚Äôt your goat now, I can‚Äôt see him doing enough moving forwards to get him there.  -Luka; still too young to project that. He has generational talent. And of all the younger guys in the league, he‚Äôs the only one I see having that kind of trajectory.   -Tacko Fall; already the goat, ya‚Äôll just don‚Äôt wanna see it, haters."
Tacko Fall goat
Tacko Fall is 7'6 what the fuck
tacko fall is so tall
TACKO FALL
"It took you a full 4 quarters to beat a team giving non-garbage time minutes to Tacko Fall, calm down there chief."
"Similarly, Tacko Fall seems to get cheers everywhere."
"he got smacked in the elbow against the Celtics, he was 0-11 shooting and was forced to play center because we had zero bigs left except Tacko Fall  He's out for a month approx"
"I'd take him on the Cavs currently, considering we're having to play Tacko Fall and Ed Davis. Could play him for minutes with Mobley at the 4."
"At least Tacko Fall shot his shot compared, to some cry baby who passed off due to some Young rimming protection."
"&gt;Isn't anything thrown near the basket an attempt at a shot though?  No, clearly not.  Otherwise alley oops wouldnt be a thing  &gt;Why not get Tacko Fall or some other giant to stand right under the rim and just alley oop every possession  3 second rule"
"Isn't anything thrown near the basket an attempt at a shot though?    Why not get Tacko Fall or some other giant to stand right under the rim and just alley oop every possession?  Heck, you could just keep Fall under the basket all game.  As long as you have an passer who could inbound made possessions all the way to other basket, you'll always have a shot attempt"
Went from having a five big man rotation to having just Tacko fucking Fall
"Last I saw, Jarrett Allen and Lauri Markannen are hurt, so they needed to give significant minutes to Tacko Fall.   So....  Kinda?"
Tacko Fall literally doesn't know how to hold a basketball I've never seen someone look so lost out there as him last night.
So if you don't count Tacko Fall because the guy plays like he's never held a basketball before we had only one other player above 6'7 which was a 6'9 Dean Wade.
"Because Love, Allen and Markkanen were all out... we literally had to play Tacko Fall during non garbage time last night because we are so depleted."
"When you take into account all the other injuries/illnesses we will probably drop every one of those games. Dean Wade, Denzel Valentine, and Tacko Fall are getting extended, non garbage time minutes."
He‚Äôs not a center it was literally the first time we played him there all year because Jarrett Allen Kevin love and markkenan were out. It was him or tacko fall (who we played a lot yesterday)   You actually don‚Äôt know what your talking about
Tacko Fall was the first player off the bench if that tells you anything about how many players aren't available.  Garland was the only normal starter available in the fourth quarter after Mobley got hurt.
"we probably go small with garland/rubio/windler/okoro/wade, with osman/valentine getting 25+ minutes. the rest of our healthy roster is literally tacko fall and our 3rd string PG kevin pangos. we boutta lose by 30 on wednesday"
"I see what you‚Äôre saying, but there‚Äôs hype around these guys for good reason. Luka and Jokic are generational talents. The other guy already talked about Herro so I‚Äôll skip over him. And Caruso was just extremely easy to meme on. You can look at a guy like Tacko fall as a black counterpart to Caruso. The only difference is that Caruso is actually a good NBA player and in the running for 6MOY this year so his fandom is of course going to be bigger, but it‚Äôs not just white guys that get favorable attention.   There‚Äôs several black players this sub fawns over as well. SGA, Jordan Poole, Lonzo, even Mo Bomba gained a cult status for a while. If you want to say that there are white players that get unnecessary amounts of attention, then okay I can see that, but there are black players who do as well so I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is a race thing or just the masses clinging to certain guys for some reason or another."
Tacko Fall had 8 minutes of not garbage time play. Cavs were down 4 starters and 2 valuable bench pieces.   When Dean Wade is the only healthy forward left on your roster you are going to have a bad time.
Cavs announcer: the problem there was giving him [Tacko Fall] the ball.   LMAO
"Javale McGee, Tacko Fall, Precious Achiuwa, Manute Bol, Bol Bol  Checkmate"

Tacko fall vs the world
Cavaliers triple 7ft lineup is must watch TV. I find it hilarious seeing them tower over everyone on the court and passing to eachother. Then when garbage time comes you see Tacko Fall tower over the three 7fters.
"Nice title, but just wonder if it would be cool to say, 'sends Tacko Fall on a one way ticket back to Africa'?"
Tacko Fall sends his regards
If you want to debate me on this you‚Äôre gonna have to deal with me saying Tacko Fall is better than Kyrie since Tacko actually plays.
This Fall belongs to Tacko
I was at the Cavs/Hornets game a few weeks ago. During one of the time outs in the 4th quarter some pogo stick enthusiasts came out and started pogoing around at half court. Tacko‚Äôs attention kept getting pulled away from the team huddle and towards the pogo stick tricks. Everyone loves Tacko Fall.
"Just stifling defense all around for the Cavs, Okoro‚Äôs offense might be rough but pair him with Frobley and it‚Äôs hard for even good offenses to score.  We probably hold them to under 70 if we don‚Äôt bring out tacko fall.    Also Mobley went 2/2 from 3, bringing his season 3pt% to 32% after a rough start.  Dudes shot is smooth too so I expect this to continue improving."
"Human victory cigar, Tacko Fall, has entered the game."
We need to take things seriously and play Tacko Fall. Get him ready to play 35 min in the playoffs.
"his size is not athleticism. he has no impressive vertical whatsoever compared to Ja and Lavine and Ant. yes its incredible the way he's built, but he doesn't have more raw athleticism than those guys. he would need a vertical and better quickness, handles, agility, shiftiness to surpass those guys. i mean he has the longest/biggest hands in the entire league and one of, if not the longest wingspans besides like Tacko Fall or Boban. if you put him through a gaunlet of agility drills those other guys would outclass him easily. take away his alien hands and wingspan (which are not athleticism) and he wouldn't be compared to those guys for pure athleticism. doesn't take away from how much of a freak he his. i mean Dwight Howard can jump like 8"" higher than him. its not like his handles or finesse around the rim truly compare to those other guys mentioned, its just that for his size those skills are remarkable."
add 8 inches to tacko fall you coward
"Yeah but the problem is its too linear of a stat that doesn‚Äôt take into consideration diminishing returns and stamina. Like if Tacko fall scores 6 points in one minute his per 36 would be 6*36PTS. That shit don‚Äôt make sense.  In a real sense For example, Jamychal Green is a good role player, but then one of the criticisms of the guy is that he has terrible stamina. Going by that logic, if we play Jamychal Green for 36 minutes his production should go bad but since its a linear stat, PER36 will say oh he‚Äôll average more points. I can‚Äôt take PER36 seriously I‚Äôm sorry."
Give him tacko fall next
"I get that but I also think raptor is a shitty metric. Darius Miller, tacko fall, and nic claxton were all top 20 last year. Over the course of a full year to be meaningful and accurate"
THROUGH HELLFIRE AND BRIMSTONE  ITS TACKO FALL
Tacko fall
Bruh can we please play Tacko Fall ?
It‚Äôs time to go full tall tree lineup.  Call up Tacko Fall to slide to the 2 guard.
tacko fall
"I remember Warriors sub were hyping Poole up when he got drafted while I was happy about Paschall being draft by Warriors. And during the Warriors tank season Kerr keeps giving minutes to Poole than Paschall and was like ‚Äúdamn, warriors are really tanking this year‚Äù cause Poole was really sloppy when he‚Äôs on court.   But then last year when I watched highlights from his Sea Dubs (because of Lin) playing time, I became a Poole believer. He was hitting 3s, running around half court, and slashing into the pain as if he was Steph Curry. He only lose this year‚Äôs MIP if Tacko Fall play MVP caliber this year."
Current he is 7th in the league behind:  Bol Bol  Tacko Fall  Carson Edwards  Dwight Howard  Thad Young  Ben Simmons
Tacko Fall in the 70s   Rondo in the 80s   Rudy Gay 90s   Dejounte Murray Early 2000s   Okafor Mid-Late 2000s
It's crazy how long they look and they have Lauri and Love out lol. Not to mention Tacko Fall on the bench. The scary thing is that their 7 footers seem pretty mobile and quick. Must be a nightmare matchup for any small ball lineups lmao.
Tacko Fall would be All-NBA
And Tacko Fall at PG!
There is something uneasy about the way Denver and Boston fans have treated their unusually tall players in Bol Bol and Tacko Fall as if they are circus freaks displayed in a carnival. I don't find this endearing at all.
So tacko fall can get in? nah I'm good
Tacko Fall&gt; Taco Bell

We have a better shot at winning those than with Tacko Fall playing point guard or whatever the fuck we would have thrown out there this week
"Lol I‚Äôll root for you guys to lose still. But this is really fucked up, I think the nba needs to pause for a minute, redo the protocols, make this safer and that olympics deadline be damned, we gotta be able to postpone games more willingly. I love how they‚Äôre willing to put bad products on the floor instead of wait.  Like, would we rather watch the Celtics led by Carsen Edwards and Tacko Fall facing off against the Heat led by Kendrick Nunn? Postpone so we can see the players we want to see. This isn‚Äôt football, if a star player goes out, the team is fucking cooked 7/10 times."
You're telling me we could get Tacko Fall??
"I think you could go to ridiculous extremes to make the ultimate player.       Tacko Fall height,  Kyries handles,  Steph currys shooting,  LeBrons athleticism,  Michael Sweetneys weight   Stan Van Gundys head  Giannis length  Rondos bb iq  Kawhiis defense  Evan Turners voice  Dikembe Mutombos durability  Semi Ojelyes biceps  etc.            I think the easiest answer is Steph/Dame/Kyrie/Nash handles &amp; shooting combined with Giannis/LeBron/Young Shaq. They would be unguarable. Imagine Jokic/KG/Durant being built like LeBron. If you approach him at the 3 he takes one step for a dunk. Even if you guard him he can put up a 45% Chance at a 3 pt shot (im assuming the extra foot of height would make a lot of shooters shots less contested)"
It‚Äôs an attempt to project potential on a player who is due for a minute increase.   If this was tacko fall or Matt Thomas. Then we‚Äôd know it‚Äôs not warranted.   But 30-34 minutes is reasonable for lamelo and projecting those numbers give you an idea of ceiling average numbers.
"Who's getting FMVP is the more interesting question, Marcus Smart or Tacko Fall?"
"It's something to pay attention too.   To the morons complaining about per 36, yes you shouldn't use it for someone playing 24 mpg, but if he's doing this at 19 in his first 10 games, he easily is on pace for those type of numbers in his prime or better. Comparing it to tacko fall or THT is ridiculous.   Obviously if someone is play 1 minute and score 2 points they will not average 96 ppg."
"Boban would, or Tacko Fall. And then they'd take photos and post them on Instagram."
Was ready to see a Tacko Fall career high due to our lack of true interior defense
Nah I got the worst of this. I just went and picked up Tacko Fall because I need blocksüòû
"Dw, we‚Äôre about to see all 7‚Äô6‚Äù of Tacko Fall UNLEASHED"
"Tacko Fall, Yao, and Shawn Bradley guarding the paint?"
Tacko Fall will have 21 blocks
"Per 36 isn‚Äôt stupid when your trying to compare players who like 21 mins vs 26 mins to truly get an idea of how their stats are with equal mins. It‚Äôs stupid when it‚Äôs brought up in situations like Tacko Fall, no shit he‚Äôs not a legit 25+ point scorer. But if your taking a guy who‚Äôs averaging 26 it‚Äôs not stupid to see what his numbers would be more like with full time mins."
Tacko Fall Career high game coming up
"[Marcus Smart, Jeff Teague, Payton Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1348353329529761793)"
Time for Tacko Fall to play 40 minutes and get a 100 point triple double
When you use per 36 numbers on a low bench player it looks stupid. Tacko fall had like 3000 p/p36 at one point
I could see tacko fall getting a triple double tho 12/14/10 and they should let him bring the ball up
"Well you can look at the Celtics, if Brown, Ojeleye and Green are out due to safety protocols related to Tatum's positive case.   They'd be looking at Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Jeff Teague, Marcus Smart, Tremont Waters, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall.  That's 6 guards 6'4 and under (4 under 6'1), Theis and Fall.  0-7 waiting to happen in the next two weeks if they're forced to play and Brown, Ojeleye and Green are held out."
"Naturally, however I believe you forgot to factor Tacko Fall having to guard Bam because all our center are out"
okay let me revise  0. Tacko Fall
We played with 11/18 last night and I thought the game should have been postponed.Which lead to Tacko fall playing almost 20min which is 13 less then he did all season last night. With 9 I‚Äôd imagine 2 random g league players are gonna be getting their opportunity
TACKO FALL I HAVE COME TO BARGAIN

Tacko Fall has just shown why the Celtics need to play him more.
Westbrook Tacko Fall after that block.
I think anyone would get blocked being that it's freaking Tacko Fall defending.
Tacko Fall is literally my favorite player in the NBA and I hope he succeeds
"Tacko Fall? More like, Tacko TALL! lol"
[Serious] Is Tacko Fall the greatest player of all time across every sport in human history?
"Deandre jordan fucking blows. he just dunks good, hes basically tacko fall"
"I don‚Äôt want to overreact, but Tacko Fall might be the best player in Celtics history."
"Thomas ""Tacko Fall"" Bryant"
Tacko Fall has 37 in 3 quarters?
Tacko Fall? That fucko‚Äô tall
in before Tacko Fall sub massacre
We meme out a lot round these parts but let me just say with complete sincerity that I believe Tacko Fall is an unstoppable force and the best player in the league.
Tacko!  Fall!
Tacko Fall is +15  I love it
All my brothers died in Tacko Fall
"&gt; ...go up and challenge a former MVP, Tacko Fall  That was the unanimous year if I recall."
Tacko fall
lopez getting bodied by strong man tacko fall
As we all expected   Tacko Fall with a game high +8
Tacko Fall is a reminder that there are good things in this world.
Idk about total players but one NBA big and Tacko Fall is our frontcourt
TACKO FALL
"That's 3 of our 4 rotation bigs out. Theis is the only big left from our regular rotation. The only other big on the roster is Tacko Fall, so this is gonna be an interesting, and likely very infuriating, stretch."
tacko fall
So is Tacko Fall.
"Before the Raps even lost a game they were getting boo‚Äôd at ‚Äúhome‚Äù and since then there have been MVP chants for Brandon Ingram, chants for Tacko Fall, etc. I‚Äôm not asking for that to change but if the league goes to Toronto to ask questions about Tampa in preparation for a potential expansion, Toronto will have nothing but negative things to say. Players will say the fans were shit."
"Love how people here actually think they can handle any NBA player for even 1 possession.   Tacko Fall and Thon Maker look as graceful as fawns that just got out of the womb in the game but they would both blitz and outmaneuver even the best amateurs, let alone redditors."
Max contract for tacko fall
"It's not even a good comp, so it's doubly obnoxious.  You can at least make a case that he's a modern version of Alex English and even then you are comparing a fourth year player with a Hall Of Famer.  But like, what about Tatum's game resembles MJs?  They were both shifty guards who hit clutch shots?  That's the kind of analysis that I get when my wife sees Tacko Fall and says, ""They should just have him dunk it every time."""
Probably Tacko Fall hitting his head on a low ceiling and getting a concussion levels of injury
Tacko Fall
Obviously it‚Äôs because Tacko Fall isn‚Äôt starting.
Tacko (H)fall
"Big Spain is just weird, no one calls tacko fall big senegal"
"You‚Äôre comparing a SF to a big man and ask why he looks more athletic. Lol. That‚Äôs like asking why Tatum looks more athletic than Tacko Fall.  ad had a better game today too, but lets talk about how he LOOKS less athletic."
Tacko Fall. Can‚Äôt argue different.
"DR Congo has Mudiay and Biyombo, and Senegal has probably the worst trio in Gorgui Dieng, Tacko Fall and Georges Niang."
