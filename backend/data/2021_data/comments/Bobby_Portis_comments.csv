That‚Äôs Fantasy God Bobby Portis you‚Äôre talking about.
Bobby portis is the garbage time king
Bobby Portis 6th Man of the Year!
PORTIS???? BOBBY PORTIS??? üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I love Bobby Portis so much
I love Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis vibes.
Pleasant: Bobby Portis  Unpleasant: DJ Augustin
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
"Dobby Portis, Hobby Bobby, Bobby Porter Jr"
"Outgoing players: Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Mo Harkless, Daymean Dotson, Wayne Ellington  Incoming Players: Alec Burks, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Immanuel Quickley (rookie), Obi Toppin (rookie)"
"They also lost Robin Lopez, and also added Bobby Portis + DJ Augistin"
Bobby Portis‚Äô face expression is killing me
"""Bobby Portis that dude is a thorn, hasn't missed a shot"" LMAO they don't hide the bias but my gawd they are funny"
Won't stand for this Bobby Portis slander
"""The Italian Cock"" Danilo galinari, The baptist john collins, General Soreness Jimmy butler, Punchbob Shitbloke bobby portis, Fartin will barton, lord covington"
is that bobby portis
Bobby Portis got sent to the shadow realm
"On the flip side though, Middleton went 5/8, Lopez was 2/3, Bobby Portis was 2/4, and Bryn Forbes and DJ Augustine each shot 3/6 from 3. It was a pretty normal 3 point shooting night for the team (36.4 compared to 39.3 on the season), just some high variance on an individual level."
"Put Jalen Harris, Bobby Portis and Khris Middleton all on the floor at the same time.  May the googliest eyes win"
Bobby Portis hitting 3s like AD
Bobby Portis is on the Bucks now?
"I always felt like Bud is closer to D‚ÄôAntoni and Doc Rivers as a coach than Pop. He‚Äôs just set in his ways and won‚Äôt deviate from what the numbers and his basketball instinct tell him.     We can slander Giannis all we want, but it‚Äôs up to Bud to put him in that position to succeed.     I‚Äôm just gonna reiterate Zach Lowe‚Äôs point that i was also yelling at the TV earlier this week: Can Giannis PLEASE FUCKING START GUARDING THE OPPOSING TEAM BEST WING PLAYER DOWN THE STRETCH OF GAMES???      I have zero beef with Giannis winning DPOY, I have beef with not using him like you should because ‚Äúthe numbers say he‚Äôs the best free safety‚Äù. Please just let Giannis guard KD in the 4th quarter. What the fuck else is he there for.      Also, get a real power forward so you don‚Äôt rely on Lopez so much. It‚Äôs clear Giannis is going to play the 5 in the playoffs. Bobby Portis ain‚Äôt it. Lopes isn‚Äôt going to play meaningful playoff minutes and Miami showed us why."
Bobby Portis against you guys aswell  [Here are his averages against chicago](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/bobby-portis-vs-chicago)  [Here are his career averages](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/portibo01.html)  [Here's last years game against chicago](https://youtu.be/0qp6zGciFOs)

Real lakers fans know the story of Bobby Portis theGreat
Fuckin‚Äô Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis putting up 10 and 8 in like 20mpg that‚Äôs kinda wild lol
Bobby Portis is Stringer Bell and Marlo Stanfield‚Äôs love child
Bobby Portis has never closed his eyes in his life
Never look Bobby Portis in the eyes. He might break your face for it üòÇ
C Webb has never seen Bobby Portis play if he thinks he can switch on defense.  Truly awful commentary.
Crazy eyes Bobby Portis.  Love him.
I miss Bobby Portis already
Bobby Portis
"Nah man they needed the cap space for uh, *checks notes* Bobby Portis."
Except mirotic and Bobby portis.
"Because it's not like he's not trying because he doesn't give af, it's because he's old and pretty washed at this point. (Also sometimes he might not care as much, but that's literally every basketball player ever, no chance guys try as hard when they're playing away games in Sacramento, compared to home nationally televised games vs other contenders, trap games are a very real thing).  Like last night he played 38 minutes (oof), mainly because he was Giannis's main defender so every minute he was in DJ had to be too (DJ was probably real butthurt that Bud played Giannis 40 minutes in a regular season game), and by the 4th quarter DJ was really laboring. Although the same thing happened last year it took DJ a good chunk of time to get into game shape, he was clearly much better in the 2nd half of the season compared to the first.  Also it's a lot different when your best players kinda just meander throughout some games when they're in their prime compared to a 12 year vet. DJ straight up doesn't have the stamina and facilities to contest every single shot and run around the perimeter chasing jump shooters.   Being a locker room guy and a good glue guy doesn't have much to do with your product on the court. Guys like Jared Dudley are some of the best glue guys despite never stepping on the court, and when he is on the court its mostly memes. If all it took to be a good glue guy was to show 100% effort and intensity all the time guys like Bobby Portis would be great, instead he's kinda too much, and punches his teammates in the face. None of us have any real information about what really goes on in the locker room, but it seems like DJ is the guy to keep the mood light and mentor the young guys, while on the court KD leads the team."
Bobby Portis Iso is the only option.
Why is bobby portis in nba
"That was the season before. My favorite thing about that fight was after Mirotic got traded to NO was at the end of the season, the NBA has teammates vote for the best lockerroom person on the team, and Bobby Portis was #1 among Bulls players lol"
TIL Bobby Portis hasn't been a Bulls player in 3 years
Why the fuck isn't Bobby Portis in?
"I really think he's one of those guys you hate to play against, or even watch as a neutral, but love to have on your team. I'm a Bobby Portis fan :)"
Bobby Portis really bothers me
"It‚Äôs probably the same if the team I like (Bucks) got Marcus Smart: can‚Äôt stand the guy at ALL, but if we got him, you‚Äôd love his fight. Bobby Portis is like that too. Less annoying than Smart. I‚Äôm sure Nets fans have already forgotten about any hate; never existed."
"i don't blame them... bobby ""crazy eyes"" portis was standing there menacingly"
Do you mean. DPOTY candidate Bobby Portis singlehandedly stops a 3 on 1 break against the best offense in the nba?
imagine letting bobby portis stop a 3 on 1 fast break
Yo Bobby Portis is a crazy motherfuckrr
"Picked up Bobby Portis for my fantasy team today, seems like a good decision"
Is Bobby Portis like really good
BOBBY PORTIS! moving on up the ladder
is bobby portis the dude who punched someone
Is Bobby Portis about to have himself a night?
Bobby Portis is beefier than I remember him being
"Bobby portis, any guard"
Bobby Portis and Sam Merrill
"dude I totally feel that, my favorite dudes in the league are jakarr sampson, bobby portis, and taurean prince. I think rooting for the guy who no one expects to be great is a lot of fun. moments like rodney hood coming in for portland in 4ot to save the game vs the nuggets are the moments I live to watch as a fan"
Bobby Portis and those serial killer eyes
oh and the bobby portis signing was clutch af
"Bucks missing all these FTs, very sloppy.    But the high PnR by the Mavs that always kills the Bucks isn't working as well as Bucks change up the defensive looks.  Nice to see team fix old flaws, Dallas used to give their defense fits.  Kinda rough first half for Bobby Portis.    Dallas has no one to defend Middleton at all.  I guess Richardson could help, but he doesn't really look like he could defend Khris either.  Khris could honestly be even more aggressive, he even turned down a couple opportunities."
Bobby Portis looks like a psychotic bowling pin
Who was it that Bobby Portis fought with when he was with the Bulls?
"3 Horse race between Clarkson, Boucher and Milton in that order. Levert was up there but will probably start for Pacers.  Boucher will probably get the starting nod over Baynes who has been shocker this year which takes him out of the race.   Bobby Portis could be the dark horse if Bucks have a break through season."
"lol why did the bucks announcer just called Bobby Portis ""The Truth""?"
all the b's in bobby portis must stand for buckets
why bobby portis of course
"Jordan Clarkson gets my vote so far. He is a walking bucket much like Lou Williams. Doesn't give you much on defense but his offensive game is so good your team gets that spark.  Just also want to mention Bobby Portis on the Bucks. Not going to win it this year, but he's bought into the system and playing really well."
My sleeper pick is Bobby Portis. He's been absolutely amazing and is the first guy off our bench.
"Also, Bobby Portis is clearly a top 25 defender in this league.  The metrics have spoken."
Be cool if they actually produced consistently off the bench. Bobby Portis dropped 20 and Bryn Forbes hit 14 but our bench is so wildly inconsistent.
Bobby Portis vibes
I‚Äôd rather watch Bobby Portis slapping people than watch Harden get these fouls (and his game in general)
didn‚Äôt bobby portis fuck nurkic up?
"Except that Bryant is at 66.2% true shooting for his career, and Bobby Portis is 53% true shooting for his career. They both have the same career points per game. Bryant is just way, way better."
He gets the minutes Bobby Portis doesn't.   When Bobby gets minutes he gets buckets. Always has.
Bryant is a much better offensive weapon than Bobby Portis
He's definitely talented offensively. He's like Bobby Portis.   He's not a starting center.
"He's more than a liability defensively. His future is a backup offensive spark plug. He's like a Bobby Portis.   While I never root for injuries, this probably improves the Wizards."
"No he wasn't. He's more than a liability defensively. His future is a backup offensive spark plug. He's like a Bobby Portis.   While I never root for injuries, this probably improves the Wizards."
The Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis effect

Bobby Portis has been very solid. I think top 5 in defensive rebounds and maybe points off the bench. But yeah DJA is a downgrade from grant hill and I pray to god we aren‚Äôt playing Thanasis in games that matter. I‚Äôd imagine he‚Äôs getting Torrey Craig‚Äôs time since he‚Äôs hurt rn  Edit: I realized I misread your comment about DJA but after watching every game this year so far my point stands
&gt;Bobby Portis   Boy got some wide eyes!
"Bobby Portis is looking like a great addition to the Bucks, good rebounder who can make shots, space the floor and punish teams for putting a smaller defender on him. High energy guy and he's already a fan favorite. His chemistry with Thanasis has to be my favorite thing about the Bucks season so far, I think he had 3 assists on Thanasis last night.    Speaking of Thanos, we all knew he'd be inevitable. Bad jokes aside he is actually an NBA caliber player. Sure he isn't a great player, but he makes few mistakes, can make the extra pass, good rimrunner and just knows what he's supposed to do, and doesn't try to do too much.    Jordan Nwora is an absolute steal, 45th pick in the draft but he's an absolutely lights out shooter and fearless as well. He'll take stepbacks that'll have you questioning everything but then he drains them like they're nothing. He looks effortless on offense. Defense needs some work, he's in the right spots generally but often just a little step too slow or half a step too far away from his man. I think that'll come with experience.    Donte is coming down to earth it seems after his hot start to the season. He's always been a little streaky but he needs to keep himself composed, no need to iso a big and take a long three when he can drive past and make a play in the paint instead. I think he'll get better as the season goes on. Hopefully his 3pt shot stays solid.    Khris, Jrue and Giannis did Khris, Jrue and Giannis things. Would like for them to show some patience sometimes though, when we go on cold streaks they'll take it upon themselves to score, iso-ing several times in a row and it often turns into ugly possesions. You can do it against the Pistons when you're up 34 but I'd rather see them play in the flow of the offense and not iso 3 times in a row.    Also Giannis, bby. I love you but for the love of god pick a FT routine and form and stick with it. I still can't fathom how an almost 75% career FT shooter turned into this. Maybe he should take up the offer Dirk's trainer gave a few years ago to teach him how to shoot. His feet are too wide, his knees turn inward, his elbow sticks out and he keeps the ball to flat on his hand it seems. Don't we have shooting coaches? If he just moved his feet to shoulder-with he'd already find it's easier to get lift under his shot.    Also glad that DJ Augstin is looking better. PS, who wants a DJ Wilson? I don't think he'll ever see the floor for us, and to be honest, he shouldn't."

Seriously Bobby Portis has the CRAZIEST eyes in the NBA. That and his white t-shirt under the jersey.
"I am here, Portis is the GOAT bobby"
"Oh no, I don't mean the players themselves couldn't compete--they'd be absolutely every bit as good! I'm just commenting on how much the game has changed since then. It's crazy to think that Bobby Portis is currently averaging Bird's career 3PA this season. I imagine a prime Bird in 2020 would be shooting 10 threes a game."
"Augustin is a solid veteran PG off the bench to led the second unit and Bobby Portis could be Brook Lopez light, he just needs to be more involved defensively. Also, Forbes is no slouch either, especially once the Bucks gel more. Connaughton has his good days but he's so inconsistent.  The Bucks could also stagger Jrue and Middleton by giving one early rest in the first leaving the other in the second unit to start the second quarter.  The hidden gem of the Bucks though is Jordan Nwora.  Jordan Nwora plays so smooth, under control, and has a deadly stroke. I would like to see the Bucks use him more off the dribble as well. The future of the NBA is developing your young players as quickly as possible to counter injuries to starters by plugging-and-playing guys, especially in the endless grind that is the modern fast-paced NBA. I could see him fighting DiVincenzo for minutes if he gets more playing time and continues to stay engaged on defense.   The Bucks are truly ten deep, they just need more of the season to become acclimated with one another."
"Idk why you would mention roster like you improved the whole roster..  You improved your guard play with Jrue. So yes your top 3 players got a lot better, thus to an extent your top 5.. but the rest of the roster are still lack luster, Augustin and Forbes are defensive liability, Torrey Craig is offensive liability, Bobby Portis is meh.   Roster in its entirety didn‚Äôt exactly take a massive upgrade really. So hopefully Bud will stick more minutes to the starter and that‚Äôs a good thing I hope"
"Donte and Bogdan roles in their respective offense are so different and small sample size I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it if I were u. Donte been looking like a knock down spot up in these early games except last night tho.   Bench is whatever tbh. Connaughton was coming back regardless because he‚Äôs Giannis work out buddy, DJA, Bryn Forbes, Bobby Portis are whatever. The value of vet min of them ring chasers could still prob give u same production anyway."
he's Bobby Portis without a spin move
Bobby Portis punched Mirotic too
Bobby Portis type beat
"No we did. Bledsoe, Hill, and Ersan makes the salaries work. We just wouldn‚Äôt have had the non-tax MLE to sign DJ Augustin and the BAE to sign Bobby Portis. Instead we would‚Äôve just had the $5.7m TP-MLE.  With that said, I stand by the Holiday trade because Giannis‚Äô prime is the next 6 years, not the next 2 years."
no we are playing him with bobby portis brook lopez pau gasol and thanasis
"For me, it's reggie jackson, bobby portis and dennis schroder. something about the dudes with the crazy eyes"
Bobby Portis singin in the back together with these kids. What a lad
Wheres Bobby Portis?
Both teams get worse. Giannis and Ben would not be a great pairing offensively (although Holy shit that defense) and Embiid on the Bucks makes Lopez irrelevant + Bucks don't have anybody else to soak up Giannis' minutes unless you really believe in Bobby Portis
"In the words of Bobby Portis: ""that's crazy"""
"Bobby Portis, career 36% shooter from 3, shooting 51% this season lol"
Bobby Portis said he would and he should be in it.
"Bobby Portis.  Every shot is money, great hook in the post, amazing jumpshooter"
NOOO. Where is league leader in 3pt field goal percentage Bobby Portis?? Wanted to see him go 10/10 on two racks and run out of time.
Well that‚Äôs not Bobby portis!
"How many 3pt shots are taken and made with consideration to how many shots get put up by the other the other 4ppl on the court, their 3pt% and 2pt%, time played, shots put up by your team in the time that you're in, and any other variables that I'm forgetting. For instance, is Bobby Portis' 50.7 more effective than Duncan Robinson's 39%"
They gon have a [meme](https://fansided.com/2021/02/04/bobby-portis-gets-introduced-best-bobby-portis-memes-reddit/) for that
i miss bobby portis
That's Bobby Portis. Jrue is out with health protocols.
Last year there were 28 players over 40% from 3 with George Hill at 46% at #1. So far this year there are 53. 8 players are shooting better than 46%. Joe Harris is at 50.5%. Jeremy Lamb and Bobby Portis are at 50%.
Bobby Portis looks like a black Eminem
Is Bobby Portis the goat?
Bobby Portis is the protagonist of the NBA
I like Bobby Portis and his crazy eyes
Playing them together just isn't gonna work. You would probably need to start Bobby Portis at PF.. same issue applys though
"Btw Portis isn‚Äôt much better lmfao, he‚Äôs worse than Brook. Atleast Brook can guard the interior, I love Bobby but he can‚Äôt guard either the perimeter or rim"
"This. What made Milwaukee so good the last 2 years was that their 2nd unit was much better than other 2nd units. Last year, George hill, divencenzo, Marvin Williams, and Robin Lopez was a really really good 2nd unit. And that doesn‚Äôt include Pat Connaughton, Kyle Korver, or Ersan. But none of that matters in playoffs. Cause your depth guys aren‚Äôt playing against other team 2s anymore. And you shouldn‚Äôt be going 10 deep in playoffs (bucks did). Part of the bucks current ‚Äústruggles‚Äù is that their 2nd unit now sucks at defense. DD is a starter, Williams retired and Lopez and hill both on new teams. DJ Augustine, Bobby Portis, and Forbes are just not good defenders. While Holiday And DD are only slightly better D combo than Bledsoe and Matthew‚Äôs (much stronger O combo though). I‚Äôm still optimistic for bucks being better in playoffs if Bud commits to playing Jrue-Khris-Giannis as much as possible while Augustine, portis, and Forbes just fill in for points off bench."
Bobby Portis for the logo!
"I‚Äôm looking at all these other subs, and it‚Äôs mind boggling how different r/MKEBucks is. It‚Äôs all just game posters, game threads, and Bobby Portis memes.  Like even though Khris didn‚Äôt make the allstar team there was one or two posts about it"
"Back when we still had fans in the arena, his brothers used to get pretty animated. They almost came out of the stands to come after Bobby Portis one time.  I can‚Äôt remember what he did, but given his known hatred for guys named Nikola, it was probably a shot to the face."
The Hornets effect. Random role players have their best games against us. Bobby Portis is another guy who  has great games against us. Im pretty sure Portis averages 30 and 10 against us.
"What evidence do you have that Bobby Portis ""gets all his buckets in garbage time"""
"Bobby Portis, the guy who gets all his buckets in garbage time?"
Lol if you think Jeff green is better than bobby portis. Thanks for the morning joke
We're definitely getting the full Thanasis experience tonight.  My favorite was when he richoted the ball he was trying to rebound off of Bobby Portis' face at 100 mph.
"This is how I remember it as well.   It wasn't necessarily Randle, it was ""Do you need Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, and Mitchell Robinson on one team? Where are all the minutes going to come from when they're all healthy?""  In retrospect it makes a lot more sense if you know that you're going to trade Morris and/or Bobby Portis.  Yeah they overpaid for both, but in doing so, the knicks put themselves in a position where there was no long term implications.  Overall it was a pretty low-risk move."
I agree. Lopez has looked really rough this year. I have a feeling Bobby Portis will end up starting for us.
"Not the Bucks. Bobby Portis is probably better than any of their bench players, but otherwise nah"
&gt;right now Middleton is better than him  middleton has been outplayed by bobby portis for the past several games
"&gt;Joe has taken close to twice as many 3s as Marcus Morris has and 3 times or more as many threes as the other two players above him in addition to Bobby Portis Jr.  I don't consider that a significant factor.  I realize that many people do, but shooting more shots does not necessarily make them harder.  There is the not-insignificant consideration that shooting more enables a shooter to be in better rhythm, and more comfortable.  For exactly the same reason that coaches rarely call a play for a cold player fresh off the bench, shooting more shots during a game is not necessarily harder.  In addition, it is easier to shoot with a permanent green light.  Joe Harris will never be removed from a game for shooting a three, from anywhere, in any situation.  A guy like Morris or Portis might -- so he has to consider that, before and while shooting.  That's very much more difficult than shooting with zero conscience."
Joe has taken close to twice as many 3s as Marcus Morris has and 3 times or more as many threes as the other two players above him in addition to Bobby Portis Jr.    Those are significant numbers. You have to go all the way down the 3p% list to Steph at number 24 to find another player with as many or more 3s then Joe.
"&gt;I know shooting is a bit inflated this year...  I'll say.  Harris is only 4th in the league, and behind a mediocre-shooting power forward ( Marcus Morris ) and just ahead of another mediocre-shooting power forward ( Bobby Portis, Jr ).  I think you have to take that into account, somewhat, when considering Harris' place in history."
"""I keep confusing Bobby Portis and Noah Vonleh, anyone else?"""
What did Bobby Portis say?

After what Bobby Portis said. He really proved it.

Bobby Portis too low
"I keep confusing Bobby Portis and Noah Vonleh, anyone else?"
Bobby Portis looks like Jordan Clarkson but with Julius Randle's eyes.
"Do you know how many free agents are out there? Brooklyn will attract some, fill their roster out and so will we. Our only good bench piece right is Bobby Portis (who we got in FA.) What we need now is a backup PG and Wing. We‚Äôll have two tradable first round picks and some second round picks on draft night so we can do something there"
"They're probably thinner than you and both you guys offer the same money and minutes. I'm not sure what you're not understanding here. If the money is the same and the mjntues are the same, they're going to go to the team in Brooklyn that has three stars over milwaukee.   You couldn't even talk to Mark Gasol or Serge Ibaka last off-season, I'm not sure why you think those caliber guys would take to you this off-season when the Nets are also in the picture.You had to pick up scraps like Forbes and Bobby portis for a reason.  This is your roster, either win with it or don't. This is it. It's not going to get any better, it'll probably get worse with guys like Lopez getting older and teams like the Nets, Lakers and Clippers taking all the ring chasing vets off the table.   At least Giannis is happy and has a lot less pressure on him because nobody expects his team to come out the east anymore but yea man, the Holiday trade was the final bullet in the chamber. This is the roster, win with or don't."
Bucks gotta get Bobby Portis some help man
Bucks need to see if they can get Bobby Portis some more looks from 3
"I hated watching Bobby portis when he was on the knicks but honestly good for him just letting it fly in Milwaukee, seems like he‚Äôs finally found his role"
Jrue Holiday/Bobby Portis
"Bobby Portis is better than him. I can't believe that's a sentence I'm typing, but it's true."
Why can‚Äôt they go back to making Bobby Portis memes
Bobby Portis has those bugged out crazy eyes...
Oh god. A Bobby Portis game
Bobby Portis should be taking notes on how to get away with attacking teammates.
Bobby Portis??
Bobby Portis!  /r/rarebobbys
There was a Bobby Portis post of him reacting to memes but nobody fucking said r/Mkebucks you people just fucking hate the Lakers lmao
"They should have been drafting around the top 5 for the last 3-4 years. Cleared up cap space and went after decent free agents while guys like Porzingis were on rookie deals.      I don't get why they went out and signed THJ or used the cap space from the Porzingis trade to get Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, and Marcus Morris. That's 4 older, mediocre, low ceiling PFs, when their 2 best young players at the time were Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson."
Where‚Äôs the Bobby Portis memes sub and why is it not pinned.
Bobby Portis you fucking stud
"Lot of the team are quietly great three point shooters. Bobby Portis was even =3rd in % in the league a couple of days ago. Bryn went 6-6 I think two games ago, Middleton is 45%+. Just stacked with them."
one day trae going to do that to bobby portis and miss 6-8 weeks with a separated shoulder
He's right.  Every team that doesn't have Bobby Portis is battling the odds.
Bobby Portis looks like a black Eminem.
Bobby portis
Leathal shooter did wonders for Bobby Portis‚Äô shot
"Kinda similar to Bobby Portis, with a little less shooting. Tweener 4/5 who can dribble enough to navigate the floor, has some moves in a pinch but not someone you want doing too much more than spotting up (elbow / 3pt), setting hard screens and cleaning the glass. Low-key quick feet on defense, reasonably switchable inside and out.  He's on that tier of fairly replaceable players that don't do quite enough to have a consistent home, but will address a need and don't give you much to complain about. Very professional and hardworking."
"Because he‚Äôs a 6‚Äô4 20 year old with a 7‚Äô1 wingspan who can shoot, dribble, pass, and defend. Oh and also because Kuzma was paid 13 million...  I mean shit if Taj Gibson, Trevor Ariza, Bobby Portis, Thaddeus Young, Maxi Kleber, Aminu, Corey Joesph, etc got paid 9-10+ million then THT definitely will..."
The og crazy eyes before Bobby Portis.
Bobby Portis has heard you.

Bobby Portis and Nikola Mirotic
If only he had Betty Davis... I mean Bobby Portis eyes!!
"I agree to an extent, but I think it might be different for us as regular folks who still have to worry about bills and stuff. Bobby Portis making 1/10 what Khris Middleton does probably doesn‚Äôt get salty about it because he‚Äôs still making $3.7 million, so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs ever going around being like ‚ÄúDamn, I wish I could eat at this restaurant. Fucking Khris could though. Fuck that guy.‚Äù"
Bobby Portis has done well in opening Jrue‚Äôs eyes
Extenshion got him the Bobby Portis eyes
"Give me Bobby Portis, Boris Diaw or a player like Robert Covington."
Bobby Portis agrees.
Bobby Portis is the GOAT
Or Bobby Portis punching Nikola Mirotic on the Bulls.
Minus bobby portis probably :/
Can‚Äôt attract free agents? You mean like Bobby Portis? Bryn Forbes? Guys who are 4th and 7th in NBA 3PT%?
Splash bros. Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes
"I fully believe that Bobby Portis is the best kind of teammate, becasue he‚Äôll punch you if you‚Äôre on some bullshit.   Show up wearing a Versace branded trash bag as a shirt with some silk Homer Simpson slippers on? Nope, Bobby‚Äôs gonna press your reset button haha"
This is what Bobby portis is for
"Eh, Donte's not as good as him now (and certainly might not ever be, though he's got potential and looks like he's improving year-to-year), but that was always looking like a questionable trade given the money Bogdan was going to command.  Main reason we were so pissed at it falling through was because we thought that could end up hurting our chances of getting Giannis to re-sign (especially with the media majorly exaggerating the closeness of the Bogdan-Giannis friendship).  Bogdan's contract wouldn't have had huge implications for our immediate roster, but it would mean we probably don't sign at least one if not two of Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, or D.J. Augustin (the choice of who not to sign there seems rather obvious now, but who knows what choice the Bucks would have made, since D.J. filled a hole on the roster while Bryn was more of a bonus depth piece.)  But it also would have pushed us way more over the luxury tax than we currently are, and with us not having so many draft picks in the immediate future, not really any easy paths to improving the team at all.  I mean, we're still *kind of* in that situation, but the Bogdan contract would have definitely made us even less flexible there."
"Bobby Portis, Donte, and Derrick White, and Pat are your 5-8 guys that will play minutes in the playoffs. And I don‚Äôt think they are as good as the nets guys in Harris, Jordan, Blake, LMA, Brown and the Lakers in Harrell, KCP, Gasol, Drummond, Morris, Kuzma"
"Giannis is a beast at center and have been playing it a lot recently, bobby portis hve been great to play the 4.   Brook isn't just a beast of rim protection anymore like last year. He only got the size and somewhat can space the floor  Imagine if player like gobert, Myles turner in this team or heck even Dwight Howard. 3-5 block per game easily"
"Between this stat and the flaming hot 3 point % from Bobby Portis, that Chicago team could have been special if they were still together lol."
Bobby Portis
CP3 to the Suns was huge. I don't think it's out of the question they make a run at the Finals. They will be a tough out with him controlling things.  Bobby Portis has been a great addition for the Bucks. 10 points a game. Improved his 3 point percentage a ton. Rebounding on both ends of the floor.
Bledsoe is garbage in the playoffs he should not be mentioned as a positive there  Jrue and Khris + 6MOTY candidate Bobby Portis + more depth this year is better in my opinion than the 2019 Bucks honestly
I don't know why people are saying this is a healthy match up. Bucks don't have PJ Tucker or Bobby Portis.
We still remember the Bobby Portis game vs the bulls fondly
Bobby Portis Wizards legend
"You‚Äôre being ridiculous. 13 million for 32 year old broken Blake griffin. I could see LMA on a 5 mil legacy deal on the blazers or spurs or something, but he‚Äôs a minimum player. I actually can‚Äôt believe you just said Blake griffin is better than any sixth man in the nba. I‚Äôd rather have trezz, Jordan Clarkson, bobby fucking Portis, or goran for Blake griffin. For the money he‚Äôs on is slightly better than a fair deal. Not some unfair robbing of the league"
Bobby Portis used to have the best return games like this lol so fired up
"The Bucks 6-9 men will be Portis, Tucker, Forbes, and Connaughton in the playoffs. You will get Thanasis as a victory cigar sometimes but that's it. Bobby Portis is better now than Blake or LMA. If LMA or Blake play meaningful minutes then the Bucks will have no problem against them (not the entire Nets team - LMA and Blake specifically), they are washed as 30+ min guys and they are old and slow as dirt for role players."
"Dude you know these guys are the Nets' equivalent of Bobby Portis and Thanasis, right? They may be washed as 30min+ starters and 1/2nd options, but they are way better than the players on our bench lol.  Spurs want to play their young guys, Pistons want to lose, Cavs want to do both. That, and ring-chasing, is why they were bought out, not because they are totally unusuable in the NBA..."
Bobby Portis and Nikola Mirotiƒá
"Free agent hall of famer Charles Barkley plans to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks, sources tell me. The Bucks stars (Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Bobby Portis) recruited the hall of famer aggressively."
He kept trying to make Robin Lopez guarding Bobby Portis happen..he did it Saturday too. Just a blatant mismatch.
"Yeahhhh, but i also dont know what you can do with this team. Watching lopez trying to guard bobby portis let alone giannis was straight pain. Alex len aint helping. Deni is averaging like 3 fouls a game. Neto is scrappy but small.  Mathews is cool tho. Beal is looking aight for now too. Please send in recommendations to brooks lol"
Langston Galloway but i dont think he gets PT anymore  Bobby Portis dropped a few 30 pointers against us  Bertans always torched us even when he was a nobody in San Antonio
Bobby Portis has COOKED us multiple times this year
Bobby Portis and Enes Kanter have long given the Sixers problems.  Marc Gasol and Al Horford were effective at stopping embiid in their younger days but they're probably a bit long in the tooth for that duty now.
"Its been a really annoying past couple years as a Bulls fan having to convince everyone of our players value from people who never watch us but have strong opinions on our players ability.   Bobby Portis, Zach Lavine, Tony Snell, Justin Holiday, Jimmy Butler if you go back far enough. The list goes on on separate accounts I've taken mad flak for just saying they're not the trash this sub acts like they are.    It really killed my engagement on here. Everyone just assumes you're a homer &amp; writes you off. Whats the point of discussing my team if somehow /r/NBA always knows better?   I wish there was a sub where we could regulate who could comment based on some way to validate if they were watching games and what games they were. They would still be able to comment but you could easily check &amp; see ""Oh they've only been verified as watching 1 Nets game this season, their opinion on them is probably malinformed &amp; can be written off."" Its authoritarian but I think the discussion &amp; content that would arise from such a thing would be really unique &amp; insightful instead of just ESPN on reddit."
Lmao bobby portis coming out of no where surprising ppl with his threes
Shoutout to Bobby Portis I didn‚Äôt know he was shooting like that
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
Man ill always love Bobby portis
Better than having Bobby portis do it I guess
Why isn‚Äôt Bobby Portis in the MVP conversation?
Bobby Portis
"Yea it's interesting seeing how the bogdan trade made them pivot, they wouldn't have as much depth as they do now and he hasn't really performed well down in atl.  OG bobby portis has been killing it off the bench too, they'll be in the mix for sure  I know it's a big if , but if Giannis had a consistent shot outside of 15 feet, there would be no argument about the mvp this year"
He has the 3rd best 3 point shooting % in the nba. Bobby Portis has the 2nd. Impressive from the bucks.
Lmao after Bobby Portis punched him in the face dude just had to leave
"I feel he‚Äôs thrown one to Middleton once... Also maybe Bobby Portis, Jabari or Plumlee or something... I definitely remember another lob  It‚Äôs hard to look up because anything with the words ‚ÄúGiannis‚Äù and ‚Äúlob‚Äù or ‚Äúalley-oop‚Äù comes up with just Giannis dunks ha"
Bucks would be interesting only because Bobby Portis is such a wildcard. LMA is slightly more reliable.
Heat are one Jae Crowder replacement away from making a second run. They miss his switchability.    * Rudy Gay? * Doug McDermott * Otto Porter * Danny Green * Bobby Portis  I don't know but they need that gap filled and then it's all gravy.
He'd be like a rich man's Bobby Portis with more heft and dribbling.
Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis too
Bobby Portis is also shooting 50% from three on two attempts per game so he‚Äôs on pace to qualify
"Bucks picked up Bobby Portis just for this haha  His 46.7% on 3s is just icing on the cake. Keep the ice handy though, you'll need it for the face once he's done"
"Bobby Portis, Bobby Firmino.   Good day to be named Bobby"
Bobby Portis will get few playoff minutes if any because defensively he's so bad you can't have a weakpoint when you need to switch everything.  PJ has proven to still be a great iso defender and he's the best option they have for KD.  Donte is the weakspot but you need hin to space the floor.  Regardless whoever doesn't have PJ or Jrue on them is gonna go off between Harden and Kyrie.  I'd stick Middleton on Harden and live with the results.  If you lose because KD and Kyrie make tough shots so be it.
Bobby Portis right now and Michael Redd all time

"Cole : Yo Portis , let's stand up together  Bobby : Sounds like a good ideam hmm"
Bobby Portis is pretty cool
I‚Äôm pretty sure Bobby Portis leads the bench in scoring per 36 minutes and rebounds unless that‚Äôs Jordan Clarkson and Dwight but he‚Äôs definitely second for both.
"When Luka's not on the court, Brunson orchestrates the offense. You really have to watch the Mavs play to understand just how large of an impact Brunson has for the Mavs in terms of the offense not stagnating. Filling a Luka-sized hole is a massive job.  That said, there are so many 6MOTY type players that Bobby Portis should be on a list. Same with THJ. There are a lot of candidates. 6MOTY is one award that I don't really care about because of how it's been awarded (except for a few outliers, like Odom being a good one back in the day)."
I'm not really sure why Bobby Portis isn't getting any 6POY hype. 11/7 on elite efficiency and top 5 in 3 point %.
"Opened the season with an injury so he never got those early games then when competing for minutes he underperformed. I think it's just a team fit issue because he's clearly found himself with you. We've unlocked Bryn Forbes, Bobby Portis and Jeff Teague so I don't think it's just a Bud thing."
"&gt; Does he have really pretty eyes that just make you get lost and forget all about your worries? Like, just really beautiful eyes, that make you weak at the knees and prevent you from forming articulate sentences whenever he's present.  You can say it: Bobby Portis"
"No, Bobby Portis is an *UNDERDOG**^(TM)*"
Bobby Portis would be a good alternative too. Theis maybe but he's more of a center.
MVP- Mr. Jokes.   DPOY- Ben Simmons. ROY-Lamelo. MIP- King Julius. 6th- Should be Derrick if he was there all year...  Go BOBBY PORTIS!  COY- Quinn Snyder
"it essentially has been for the past 5+ years, I do think Clarkson is deserving especially since the Jazz has over exceeded expectations. Rose &amp; Bobby Portis need more recognition though."
Blake just did this single handedly against bobby Portis. So I'll say yes
Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis and Blake Griffin both punched someone in the face.
Right after the All Star game I went on the Bucks sub looking for the clip of Giannis ending his zoom interview holding up his all star mvp trophy going ‚ÄúMilwaukee! This is fo you!‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt find that clip anywhere on their sub for some reason. But what I did find was a picture of the basketball court with Bobby Portis‚Äô face in the middle and it said ‚ÄúBobby Courtis‚Äù  I‚Äôve been thinking about it ever since
Ayy Bobby Portis plays for the Bucks? How's he been for ya'll?
Taj Gibson and Bobby Portis were included in that too.
Bobby Portis
I feel like Bobby Portis is just crazy eyed enough to do it.
Bobby Portis definitely has a closet full of skeletons
Bobby Portis would kick right through your ass with his fist.
"You right, Bobby Portis was out"
"Bobby Portis gets 11 a game because most teams can somewhat stop Giannis from running them over, so they can guard portis.   But if it becomes a situation like Giannis vs these nets,  he‚Äôs just going to attract a double in the middle every play and get portis an open shot (unless they want Middleton to take it).  That‚Äôs why Giannis is a lot more dangerous than guys like durant or lebron. He‚Äôs much easier to stop than lebron is, but if Giannis doesn‚Äôt get stopped, the rest of the bucks basically get to play like they are open.  Nets don‚Äôt have the matchups to deal with him."
Bucks didn‚Äôt have Bobby Portis
No Bobby portis though
"You haven't been watching Bobby Portis play at all this season if you think his 11pg means anything. The man is a bucket, even against 1st units and kills 2nd and 3rd unit defenses."
I for one would never want to duel Bobby Portis.
"I mean KD also had an incredible game, the Nets actually shot better from 3 than they normally do on more attempts than they usually take, shot better on free throws, and got far more rebounds than normal.   And kyrie was bad but jrue was below his averages offensively despite his masterclass defensively  and Bobby Portis would have been helpful too. Nets are by far the favorite but I think people are acting like the Bucks played as good or better as they‚Äôll be able to do in the future and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs guaranteed"
You mean Harden will be dueling Bobby Portis üò§
"Calling out Bobby Portis, smh does Giannis hate his own teammates?!"
Bobby Portis is not comparable to Harden.
It‚Äôs a decent point to be fair. But we were also missing our superstar in Bobby Portis
"Hey now, we didn‚Äôt have the GOAT Bobby Portis..."
"Bucks were missing their best bench player in Bobby portis, so hopefully yes."
Oh damn rematch on Tuesday. I‚Äôm excited. Hope bobby portis is back for it
"I just realized bobby portis isn‚Äôt playing today. He‚Äôs ok right??? He‚Äôs one of my favorite Bucks, he‚Äôs made such a huge difference in all their games I‚Äôve watched this season"
We got Pj as well and Bobby Portis not playing
Bobby Portis is way better then 4th
"You know the nets are missing harden, but the bucks are missing Bobby portis. So really, we‚Äôre at the bigger disadvantage"
Bucks don't have Bobby Portis who is their 4th most important player tho. He changes completely the bench dynamic.
So is Bobby Portis about to get a dnp coaches decision?

Bobby Portis. There is no need to name 4 more who are clearly inferior participants in the game of basketball. It‚Äôs Bobby‚Äôs world and we‚Äôre all just living in it.
"Bobby Portis is scary. Man turned into a sniper from deep overnight, it feels like."
Hes been watching bobby portis film
BOBBY PORTIS???
Oh DRose and Bobby Portis have been great as well!
Bobby. PORTIS
"Not really, NBA is really hard to watch right now because of it for casual fans.   I went to a Bucks game and the entire starting lineup was out. The Bucks starting lineup was Jordan Nwora, Jeff Teague, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Bryn Forbes, and Bobby Portis.   Now, I go to a lot of Bucks games so I didn't really care, but what if that was someones first and only chance to go to a Bucks game this season. They should have someone standing at the door with a voucher for a free game or discount to another game or to the merch shop when that type of thing happens. People aren't paying $100 a ticket to see Thanasis Antetokounmpo."
Surprised Bobby Portis has zero mentions
"Joe Ingles should win over both of them, I'm shocked Bobby Portis isn't getting more buzz, and DRose should get votes at least"
Bobby Portis
bobby portis looks like muttiah muralitharan
Bobby buckets Portis has been phenomenal for the bucks. And is top 5 in 3pt% if I‚Äôm remembering correctly.
Bobby Portis
"Nice list, pretty much agree other than maybe swapping the 76ers and the Bucks. I really do rate Jrue's addition that highly, significant upgrade on Bledsoe. Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes have been really nice pick ups too and I expect PJ Tucker to come in handy. Plenty of shooters around Giannis for when teams build the wall, just have to knock the open looks down."
"Stat boys will say those selections are ""narrative based"" and the true All Def team should be Bobby Portis, Harkless, Noel, Boban and Trae or some insane shit like that"
Jrue will most likely be matched up with Harden. Regardless I'm guessing Brook Lopez/PJ Tucker/Bobby Portis and Dizicenzo will be the ones forced to guard Kyrie/Harden as they will hunt those matchups
Bobby Portis got a really good stank face for refs.
Bobby portis
Bobby portis. Def no bias
Steven Adams and Bobby Portis
He's scared of Bobby Portis
Knicks LEGEND Bobby Portis
Flashbacks to the Bobby Portis game last year üòÜ
bobby portis really put up 23 pts in 23 min last time
"So your argument is more theoretical than actual  You can say Bobby Portis is better because the argument would be his high 3 pt %  In reality, Russ/LeBron score more in transition and playmake more in transition."
Bobby Portis 3 mil
Are we just saying shit to say shit?  Cause then Giannis should be MVP and Bobby Portis should be 6th man of the year.
Nerf Bobby Portis Plz
Can we put some respect on Bobby Portis. Those back to back to back 3s basically killed off Philly‚Äôs momentum late in the third. His offence has taken a huge leap this season.
"What can you do when Bobby ""Klay Thompson"" Portis and Khris "" Kevin Durant"" Middleton show up?"
Bobby Portis said what rebounds
Bobby Portis is the man!
Bobby Portis is the best center in the East tbh
None of them are Bobby Portis though tbf
Bobby Portis Jr. has a stronger MVP argument than Joel Embiid.
why can‚Äôt we have a Bobby Portis ü§®
Bobby Portis needs to chill the fuck out
"I don't know if Philadelphia's strategy of ""let Bobby Portis Jr. shoot as many open 3's as he wants"" is the correct approach."
Dell Curry must‚Äôve adopted Bobby Portis before the game
That's future Finals MVP Bobby Portis to y'all
oh my god bobby portis has been amazing this year
bobby portis is going to lead the bucks to a championship
Better to contest a layup and let Bobby Portis take an open 3
"Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis has negative +/-, so I guess that‚Äôs something unexpected"
"Bobby ""Rondo"" Portis"
Bobby Portis looks like the Can I have your number guy from that madtv skit
Every time I watch the Bucks this year I‚Äôm always so impressed with Bobby Portis
Bobby ‚ÄúüëÄ‚Äù Portis Jr.
Some (ex) bucks ones:  Ersan Ilyasova: Best at drawing charges ever  Bobby Portis Jr: Best at doing that eye pop thingie you know what I mean?  Giannis: Best at shoving Mike fucking Dunleavy into the standings like the ugly little fucker he is. Fuck mike dunleayy that fuck.   John Henson: best at having an incredibly flat ass
Why not just play Bobby Portis and attack the Nets size disadvantage
"Giannis suffers from some weird iteration of relapsing/remitting dumbfuckitis.   Sometimes he‚Äôs a fucking closer beast that dominates the entire game and lifts the value of everyone around him.   And sometimes he gets a perfect iso matchup and decides to take a low% fade away midrange over a notoriously not great defender that‚Äôs literally hobbled, turns the ball over at the worst moment, and let‚Äôs his team fall apart around him.   Bud however is literally the worst crunch time adjustment coach in the NBA. PJ Tucker was contributing *nothing* on either side of the ball and played for 33 fucking minutes. 33 minutes, *zero fucking points*. Patty Con had more points and played tougher defensive minutes than Tucker did and he‚Äôs *Patty Con*. Bobby Portis didn‚Äôt play at all, at least he could have scored a couple buckets.   ‚ÄúPJ was out there for his defense and to get under KD skin.‚Äù Yeah it worked really well, KD had the third greatest playoff performance in NBA history. Shit I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 and I think *I* could have played tougher D on KD.   Jrue Holiday hasn‚Äôt been lights out, but fuck he only played 30 minutes that whole game! Khris and Giannis each played 40+, the the fuck isn‚Äôt Jrue out there for 40+ if he‚Äôs supposed to be your 3rd option playmaker guy that‚Äôs an insanely good defender?   When the Bucks lose (and they‚Äôre gonna lose), it‚Äôll be 80% Bud‚Äôs fault and he should be fired promptly. Even if by some fucking miracle we win game 6 and 7, beat the 76ers or Hawks, beat the Suns or whoever the fuck rolls out of the West unscathed and win the title‚Ä¶ *still fucking fire Bud*."
"Bobby Portis saw 0 minutes last night. Could be injury, could be playoff Bud. It's distressing that both are possible."
Donte is not on the level of the 8 all stars that have missed games stop. Neither is Bobby Portis
"This was by far Bud's most inexcusable performance he's had. After all season of experimenting with adjustments and not riding and dying with the scheme I though there was maybe a chance in the playoffs he'd adjust.   But nope.   1) Harden played more than Giannis which is UNBELIEVABLE.   2) The team was making off-ball movement in the first half which made it exceptionally easy for the ball-handler to drive and dish. We completely went away from that in the second half. There was several possessions with Jrue, Giannis, and Middleton where they get the ball at the top of the key, NOBODY moved, and they waited until 5 seconds left on the shot clock to promptly throw up a contested shot.  3) Bud left Brook in the game while he was the reason for 5-6 open threes in a row while he hid in the paint. Bud went big, okay great, so we were at least abusing the only benefit of this and posting him up right? Wrong, Brook didn't get to post up his 6'8 center defender Jeff Green a single time.  4) Bud played ELIJAH FUCKING BRYANT in this game, who has played one NBA game before this playoffs, instead of Bobby Portis or even just Pat in the first half, this allowed the Nets to go on a solid little run when we were streaking in the first half.  5) And to top it all off, KD is going absolutely nuclear, best game of his career. Absolutely HUNTING Brook(who should've left the floor after the first 4 KD mid-ranges) and Pat(who tried his best but was too small) and Bud hides Giannis in the corner on Joe Harris. Doesn't double KD off of Harden who literally looked drunk out there.   I get a lot of people are saying ""Giannis can't fight around screens, KD would probably cook him"". Great, can we at LEAST FUCKING TRY IT. He's obviously cooking everybody else, and you have a DPOY AT LEAST SEE IF IT WORKS. We saw this exact case with Jimmy last year, Giannis never guarded him, he torches. Giannis demands to guard him a year later, absolutely locks him down. I'm not saying he would lock KD down, but that pattern has to make you think ""hey maybe this could work I'll give it a shot"".  For me this is peak Bucks disappointment. I barely came in with high expectations this year, with this current team I will never again expect us to win anything."
Anyone know why the bucks aren‚Äôt playing Bobby portis?
"Well when he ran like 6-7 consecutive PnRs targetting Brook Lopez I probably would have stopped playing Brook Lopez.   Either slide Giannis up to the 5 or bring PJ Tucker back or play Bobby Portis or something.   Hell, even some sort of zone scheme where Lopez hangs back and a wing defender comes in to help with the PnR could have maybe worked.  **tl;dr** something &gt; nothing."
Bobby Portis who
"Lmao. This team is the mentally weakest worst coached team with championship talent ever assembled.  Buds awful coaching 2 years ago assured that. They have grown into their coach. This is the 7th time they've blown a 15+ point 2nd half lead IN THE PLAYOFFS since that Raptors series started. I've never seen anything like it  This fucking coach played Elijah Fucking Wood for 3 minutes who proceeded to get cooked for 2 threes and a layup when he had Bobby Portis on the bench. A guy who shot nearly 50% from 3 in the regular season. The guy who arguably won them game 3 after the Nets first took the lead, he scored 8 straight. The guy who had 3 blocks on 4 possesions in game 4."
"Lmao. This team is the mentally weakest worst coached team with championship talent ever assembled.  Buds awful coaching 2 years ago assured that.  They have grown into their coach. This is the 7th time they've blown a 15+ point 2nd half lead IN THE PLAYOFFS since that Raptors series started. Under Bud in the playoffs. I've never seen anything like it.  This fucking coach played Elijah Fucking Wood for 3 minutes who proceeded to get cooked for 2 threes and a layup when he had Bobby Portis on the bench. A guy who shot nearly 50% from 3 in the regular season. The guy who arguably won them game 3 after the Nets first took the lead, he scored 8 straight. The guy who had 3 blocks on 4 possesioms in game 4."
"How do you chalk this up? Is it the mental gymnastics from these Bucks players or coaching problem?   Giannis late 3, stupid fadeaway, having the ball in his hands less than a min left so he can shoot FTs.   On top of Khris Middleton trying to shoot over a locked-in Kevin Durant. People only see KD's offensive prowess but he was locked in on defense as well.   No ball movement which was their bread and butter.   Brook Lopez and not even playing Bobby Portis which would give them more mobility over Uncle Jeff."
Where in the heavens was Bobby Portis
"Trade Middleton, Forbes and Bobby Portis for Dame lmao"
"Great performance from KD. The man does not fail to impress.  What is up with the Bucks offense in the second half? No PnR? Brook trailing 5ft behind the arc launching 3s instead of posting up? Just running and gunning when we were up 14 instead of slowing the game down and wasting some clock?  Also pretty confused as to why Elijah Bryant, Thanasis and Forbes were getting minutes and not Bobby Portis..."
"Bud.   - Giannis should have been on KD all night long. KD probably still has a good game, but not a 49 pt triple double. That‚Äôs a Bud call.   - PJ Tucker played for 33 minutes and scored 0 points while KD and Jeff Green set them on fucking fire. If he‚Äôs out there for his defense he didn‚Äôt fucking play any. Bobby Portis could have let KD throw down 49 too and he probably would have scored more than 0 points.   - Jrue played for only 34 minutes. Giannis and Khris each played 40+. Why? Because Bud is a moron.   Giannis made some real dumb decisions, but Bud is the one making the schemes and matchups."
Why is Bud so dumb? Why is Giannis's shot selection so bad? Why didn't they try to attack Harden in every possession? Why did they not try putting Bobby Portis in? Whyyyyyyy?!
The Bucks with Giannis at 5 and Portis at the 4 absolutely killed the Nets i game 4.  Portis had 8 points and 2 blocks in 3 possesions in 2 minutes in game 3.  &gt; Bobby Portis	0:00	0-0	0-0	0-0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0  Seriously.  Im legit angry. WHAT. THE. FUCK. BUD.
" ""Giannis, you are larger, faster, and stronger than everyone on the planet except for maybe Joel Embiid. If you shoot another jumper, I will have Bobby Portis immediately punch your brother on the bench.""  ""Everyone else, if you spend more than 3 second standing around the three point line without setting a screen for someone else, I will sign your sibling, put them on the bench, and then have Bobby Portis punch them."""
Where is Bobby Portis
Where's bobby portis
KD will hunt him. Where‚Äôs Bobby Portis for Brook more like it.
And Bobby Portis has 0 minutes lol
Why is Bobby Portis not playing?????
&gt; Bobby Portis	0:00	0-0	0-0	0-0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
&gt; Bobby Portis	0:00	0-0	0-0	0-0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0  Bud Fuckign sucks.  Im literally shaking. Portis had 2 of the biggest stretches in both games 3 and 4.
"Like 12 straight.  Those 4 straight open 3s attacked him too.  Im serious, did Bobby Portis miss the plane ride? Dude had 5 stops in a row in game 4 and 8 straight point and 2 stops in game 3."
WHERE THE FUCK IS BOBBY PORTIS
For the love of god take Brook out for a Bobby Portis or have Giannis guard that so KD isn‚Äôt doing the same thing over and over. It‚Äôs like watching a 2K glitch.
So where is Bobby Portis?
I'm not playing Marco Polo anymore. Only Bobby Portis.  Where is Bobby?
Why has Bobby Portis not played??
How come Bobby Portis hasn't played. He was suppose to be their sixth man. He does decent job on Durant. Alternative to PJ Tucker.
Did Bobby Portis just not get on the plane?
Why isnt Bud playing Bobby Portis?
Is Bobby Portis hurt?
Free Bobby Portis
Why the fuck hasn‚Äôt Bobby Portis gotten minutes yet
What does Brook Lopez bring to the table that Bobby Portis doesn‚Äôt?
No Bobby Portis on all this?  Dude was immense in a Giannis at the 5 lineup.
Where the fuck is Bobby Portis???
Where's Bobby portis?
where the fuck is bobby portis what
Saw Bobby Portis on TV
Bobby Portis is a bucks legend and I will tolerate no slander
Non stop Bobby Portis iso posting up Harden coming up!
[Nemanja and Strahinja were incredibly close to getting on the floor lol](https://twitter.com/bsdenverdylan/status/1404598163328016384?s=21)  Last time I saw them that fired up was when Bobby Portis pulled his classic ‚ÄúI hate everyone named nikola‚Äù and tried to do Jokic like he did mirotic by elbowing him in the nose.
Giannis doesn‚Äôt scare me. Bobby Portis does.
Weird to use Claxton and Shamet as examples without naming the 6 other healthy guys who play more minutes than them. That‚Äôs like saying the Nets shouldn‚Äôt be losing to Bobby Portis and Elijah Bryant.
"What if *that* is who you are though?  I know, I know, in the relaxed environment of the regular season Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are 3pt gods. But are they really?  In all Bud's teams shooting would go up in the regular season making you think that he does make the team(s) shoot better (through his system or whatever), but without fail they would return back to earth come playoff time.  Maybe what you see *now* is the truer ability of your players. Maybe you are not a 38% shooting team (or however high it was in the regular season( but rather a 33% team). I.e. most of your shooters are not that good, because they only shoot well in a relaxed environment.  What I love about Euroleague is that teams really try in their ""regular season"". Yeah players (and teams) are one tier down than even the average NBA team/player, however what you see (there) is what you get. You pretty much have an idea of which team(s) will perform and which won't. In the NBA things are different , the long season makes it impossible to gauge the true capabilities of a team.  For example the Nets were a bad defensive team and suddenly as it turns out they are pretty good, *because* they were saving themselves for the playoffs (for all the good that did to them). Similarly , what if your team never turns it up from 3 because you were never that good at it, not really?"
It so is...I was expecting some Bobby Portis crazy eyes type shit  but instead all I got as a mildly upset Jokic getting up in Bookers face for trying to backup his teammate
"Ah yes, they have stars like Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton coming off the bench"
He should have all his minutes matched with Embiid cause Lopez does a pretty good job on him and their backup is Bobby Portis....
Bobby portis is a 37.5% three point shooter in these playoff Brook Lopez is 23.5% Brook also shot 33.8 in the regular season to Bobby‚Äôs 47.1 so unless your telling me Bobby forgot how to shot over his last 4 attempts he‚Äôs clearly a better shooter then Brook considering they get the same looks open catch and shoot threes
Wasn‚Äôt saying portis was the sole option was saying he was an option chief needless to say I was saying you needed to go smaller to matchup better with  Brooklyn and to give Giannis more space but to be fair we all know you guys still be getting your ass waxed if not for 2 of Brooklyn‚Äôs top 3 going down. And implying Bobby is worse or the same as Brook at guarding perimeter players is laughable.
Lol what? They aren't supermen or something. I mean did people already forget how Bobby Portis caved in Mirotic's face when he tried to puff up? Dude ran all the way out the league.  People watch way too many movies or something.
"Not an all star, but Bobby Portis"
"Bucks probably aren't going to get better than this for a little while. Outside of trades, here's the ground that can be gained;  * A second-round pick/undrafted player develops into a 6-8 off the bench level player * Donte is young coming into his fourth year so could develop * Giannis is still only 26, so still has room to get better  Ground that can be lost;  * Our first-choice, slow moving centre will turn 34 next year * PJ Tucker is a UFA, and also will turn 37 * Bobby Portis can turn down his player option of $3.5~ million (he is worth much more than this) * Bryn Forbes can turn down his player option of $2.5~ million (he outplaying his contract)  There might be other stuff, but we'd need things to really fall our way to improve the roster. *If* Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis take their player option (not impossible, imo) then they're both young and have improved in a big way this year so that could be a factor."
That was when I became a Bobby Portis fan
Bobby Portis just camped in the paint defending absolutely nobody and the refs don‚Äôt care
"KD was much closer to the hoop, but Portis was open. I gotta go with Bobby"
bobby portis feels like a very old school type of player. i think he would do well in the 90s
Bobby ‚Äúcrazy eyes‚Äù Portis
Is Bobby Portis the worst 40% 3 point shooter ever?
Bobby Portis looking like a god damn psycho lmao
Bobby portis &gt; brook lopez?
Bobby portis the sequel
Bobby mf Portis
Bobby portis
I love Bobby portis wish he played over PJ and that giannis guarded KD
LMAO Bobby Portis just made Blake his bitch. Wow
Was that Bulls and Knicks legend Bobby Portis?
Bobby Portis
"Joe Harris, Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis all nearly shot 50% this season and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre getting buzzer beating shots."
"Bryan Forbes and Bobby Portis hit a ton of 3 in Miami series, those 2 guys don‚Äôt get to see the floor this series as much bc they‚Äôre absolute bbq chicken for the Nets on defense"
Za‚Äôdarius stayed after and Bobby Portis and some tall blonde guy grabbed rebounds for him. Took him 13 shots to make 1 3 pointer.
"&gt;I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not ‚Äúcheap‚Äù  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn‚Äôt the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn‚Äôt he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren‚Äôt cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren‚Äôt exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don‚Äôt have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don‚Äôt have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don‚Äôt trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don‚Äôt know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I‚Äôll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there‚Äôs a high chance of us bringing back. So you‚Äôre talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that‚Äôs 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you‚Äôre in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that‚Äôs fine.   Now I don‚Äôt even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we‚Äôre talking about the Lakers."
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
They didn‚Äôt show up because the starting 5 played most of the minutes. What is your argument? Play Giannis less and play Bobby Portis more? Are you even thinking about what you‚Äôre writing?
"I was actually wishing that Bud didn't put him back in at one point with Bobby Portis playing well, but I was also pissed af every time  Giannis shot a three. Lol"
the only two bucks players who should be getting any praise for this game are brook lopez and bobby portis i dont wanna hear nothing about middleton
Bobby Portis deserves better
I love bobby portis
Is Bobby Portis or Bruce Brown the true MVP over that fake Jokic?
bobby portis vs bruce brown 1v1 for the series win
Bobby Portis is objectively a better offensive player than Giannis

Bobby Portis with the Nintendo Wii eyes
Bobby Portis is a walking bucket. But Bucks still threw their lead hard.
I always thought Bobby Portis looked liked a supersized small person
"Bobby Portis, meme master"
"Bobby Portis just scored a basket, so presumably Bud will sub him out for not following instructions"
"I LOVE BOBBY ""CRAZY EYES"" PORTIS"
Bobby ‚Äúcrazy eyes‚Äù portis
"I would like to see a little more of Bobby Portis.  But, I agree with you on that other part."
"Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes as your 4th, 5th, and 6th best players is absolutely horrendous outside of Lopez. Forbes has struggled to stay on an NBA roster for years and now he gets big minutes for the Bucks lol.    Nets are pretty deep. Griffin and Harris are really good role players. Brown, Shamet, and Claxton are solid too.   Not even compatible, stop making a fool of yourself lol"
Hahaha don't think i didn't catch you just slipping that in there lol. All time greats yeah but smooth to try and put michael jordan in that sentence alongside Bobby 'The Tortis' Portis
"So did Michael Jordan, so does Bobby Portis. All of the all-time greats do this"
"Lol yes i'm serious but you're entitled to your own opinion.  Durant &gt;&gt; Giannis  Kyrie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Middleton  Sure, Jrue Holiday is &gt;&gt; Joe harris but the gap between the top two nets versus top two bucks is huge.  I'd also argue shammet, mike james, claxton are equal role players/bench to bryn forbes, bobby portis (LOL), and pat connaughton..."
"it looks like the problem here is jeff teague, and bobby portis didn't step up."
Bobby Portis should just sign for Bellator at this juncture
"I'm not over ""Actually that was Bobby Portis, but Thanasis is also on the floor"""
Looked more like a Bobby Portis impression
Go back 3 years and tell Bulls fans that Bobby Portis is gonna force a back-to-back 40 point scorer to pass the ball away in the NBA finals.
Wilt ‚ÄúBobby Portis‚Äù Chamberlain
Bobby Portis triple-triple. That‚Äôs my stupid hypothetical scenario. Discuss!
What if Bobby Portis dropped 100?
"Lite means a worse player of a similar play-style. Just because they are good shooters, does not mean that Klay is ‚ÄúSteph lite‚Äù.   Is Joe Harris also a Steph Lite? Was Bobby Portis basically Steph Lite this year?"

"Because they had to be playing incredible basketball to go up by 16. The other things (intangibles) are the Bucks bread and butter. During our series against them it became annoyingly clear that they don‚Äôt win from offense. They are all good on the glass their entire 1-5 starting and then Bobby Portis off the bench all crash the glass very well, they are known for their defense with not only Giannis but Jrue Holiday, Lopez is a certified paint protector (not bpg but ofg% in the paint) by holding opposing players to an entire 11% below their averages around the rim. They are a huge team and Pat and Tucker both are those types of dudes willing to give everything they got every single possession ( loose balls, offensive rebounding, straight hustle dudes ) . I‚Äôm not sayin there is no chance for the Suns, but so far the Bucks haven‚Äôt been playing their best offensive basketball - compared to what we saw against ATL - and are still up 3 - 2 because of the intangibles. This is why I said what I said, because if you‚Äôre going to beat the Bucks, it will not be because you out hustles or outrebounded them"

"It's like saying that kobe is overrated by looking at the stretch between the shaq dynasty and the pau years. It's OK to point out the obvious. What's annoying to anyone who watched those teams are ppl acting like the team was actually pretty good. If I could create a modern version of that team for visualization:    Josh Richardson AI MKG Bobby Portis (No good dikembe comp, imagine an older gobert where his jumping diminishes).  6th man (mckie) like a poor man's jrue holiday.    Like yes, really effective defensive team, but holy shit, zero spacing and all players liable to get extremely cold at any given time at the other end. What made AI so great despite the inefficiency was that he would still put pressure on the defense regardless every possession so there was never a play off even if there was a scoring drought causing the opposing team to be alert and extend energy, and he always racked up fouls bc he wasn't afraid of going inside and getting hit."
"&gt;He ranked 79th out of 84 NBA power forwards last season with a defensive real plus-minus of -1.7.

"Collins has been getting a lot of hate, but it was his first playoffs and the teams Atlanta played all had good to great veterans at the PF rotation.  He was a young guy going against Blake Griffin, Giannis, Bobby Portis, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, and Julius Randle. That would be a tough gauntlet for any PF's first playoff run."

"You‚Äôre blaming the wrong person.  He came from nothing as someone with too little talent to make the NBA and scrapped and fought in every way he could to make it.   Full effort on defense and does anything he can to win.    He got paid millions to be a dirty ass 3&amp;D and he doesn‚Äôt apologize for it.   Still bothers me that he‚Äôs dirty, but so is Draymond Green and Bobby Portis who‚Äôs injured more players than Beverly has.  Dirty players with great defense get paid.  You gotta blame the system that pays him, because this was the only way he could make those millions."
"now if they didn't sign Bobby Portis, that's a different story"
"now if they didn't sign Bobby Portis, that's a different story"
Bobby Portis got resigned. I think that was their main focus. And KD can't really be guarded by anyone much less an aging PJ Tucker.  He averaged 40+ in that series. . They'll find other ways to make up for that. Giannis and Jrue are still first team defenders still.
"They kept Bobby Portis, which is of more importance"

Bobby Portis is still in the league. Metu will probably get some consequences and rightfully so. Still not gonna deal with a random player trying to injure him in a summer league game when they are down 18.
"I'm watching the GS-NO game and saw a dangerous undercut on a defender, who fell to the floor. Another play that happens ~weekly in the league. Funny, that player didn't get up looking to knock someone out.  Bobby Portis punched a teammate in practice and was still suspended for like 10 games. What the hell are you talking about?"
Dude did a push league foul. That‚Äôs how you injure someone. Clearly you never did sports and don‚Äôt understand how an injury from a summer league random can messed up his whole career.   I‚Äôm sorry if Bobby Portis can break someone‚Äôs jaw and be in the league then a forearm punch isn‚Äôt anything. No manager is gonna have this influence their decision.

"Kukoc was the 3rd best player on a 3 time back to back to back championship team (between Rodman and him depending on your preference); he was not just a role player.  Kukoc was nice! He was a mismatch at his size because of his shooting ability.  He could take bigs off the bounce and was able to hit shots over smaller defenders because of his giant 6‚Äô11 frame.  Although he was huge, he played like a small forward.    In my opinion, if he were on a team where he was the central focus of the offense, he could have led an average to below average team to the playoffs as a 7th or 8th seed.  Which is comparable to someone like Bradley Beal or ja Morant.  His game was not like those two, they are better shot makers and are more dynamic.  Kukoc was a better passer, rebounder, and shooter. I use these two to illustrate what I think his impact on a team would be.  Those two players are not considered roll players and I don‚Äôt think kukoc would be considered one either if he were to be playing today.    His game was perfect for today‚Äôs nba. Who knows though? I hear you with your argument that he is not as good as jokic, you‚Äôre spot on.  But kukoc was much more than just a role player (much better than joe Harris or Bobby Portis)"
"Bulls fan here. Almost all our guys we drafted post Jordan era showed flashes of stardom but ended up being sort of nothing:   Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Taj Gibson,  Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr.   No, I don‚Äôt count Derrick Rose. He won MVP, all star starter, blew out the big 3 Heat in the ECF in Game 1, and single handedly stopped the Linsanity."
"So team impact over actual skill? Yeah man, I'm taking Bobby Portis over SGA!"
"That's NBA Champion Bobby Portis for you, sir."

"Ring chasing will always be a thing, but realistically there's only so many spots and so many guys who can qualify and are good enough to fill those spots.   An example is Bobby Portis. The expectation was he was gonna collect the bag and go somewhere else. He got a moderate deal with the potential for a bigger one after bird rights kick in to stay in MIL. But that's not a guarantee. He could play significantly worse, he could  have an injury that kills his value. You never know. The point is, he was on a title team and couldn't get rewarded because of cap rules."
"Just picture it...Bobby Portis AND Lance. Guaranteed memes, every night."

"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should‚Äôve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that‚Äôs been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we‚Äôve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He‚Äôd make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I‚Äôm a strong believer in him. I think he‚Äôll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that‚Äôs still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who‚Äôs proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn‚Äôt playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn‚Äôt decide between. They‚Äôre the same price but I‚Äôm not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I‚Äôd honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."

That is a great post! But I would take out Kareem for the Bucks and replace with Bobby Portis.
"Right. I agree with you there, and now it's becoming a 'what did OP mean"" type of thing lol we all know what 3&amp;D guys are, but the question (in addition to the title itself) was who maximizes value on D while being a 'big' threat from 3?  KD is the answer if you're answering 3&amp;D *capability* rather than limiting it to 'only' 3&amp;D.  KD's 45% from 3 is only topped by Bobby Portis, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Bryn Forbes and Joe Harris. Neither of those guys are better defensively than KD, and those better defenders out there aren't shooting nearly what KD shoots from 3pt range.  Btw, I specifically gave a two part answer (KD/Mikal Bridges) to OP to cover all ground to because I figured the KD answer would turn into this when I saw it lol   Bridges was my answer of choice if we're talking specifically 3&amp;D role guys.  Who did you end you picking as the answer OPs question?"
Joey Crawford high stepping up the court like Bobby Portis lmao
"I think staying is his best option as well.  It's the first time in his career he will have the same NBA level head coach as the previous season. The roster is much better with guys like Derozan and Lonzo on the team, it should mean more spot up jumpers for Lauri, which is 80% of his offense.  There's no money left for him this Summer, so taking the QO and balling out on a playoff team, similar to Bobby Portis, is probably his best bet on getting paid and a larger role from another team."
I remember Bobby Portis hating on Pau and Larry Nance hating on Kobe. Then they became teammates
"We're definitely seeing more of a transition to small-ball in the playoffs if it means that teams don't have to put a player on the court that'll get exploited. Jeff Green, Marcus Morris, Dario Saric and Bobby Portis all come to mind. I would not consider any of them to be a traditional 5.  But as I mentioned, even the small-ball guys got paid."
"And Bobby Portis would've got more if he went to another team, but he took a discount to stay with Milwaukee"
"I guess it depends on who you define that is and what you define cheap as.  If JaVale McGee or Bobby Portis fit that role then yeah, but they both still went for more than the vet min."
"No not invalid, just honestly don‚Äôt think you knew LeBron did that before or you probs would have cited someone else.  Also some players just actually don‚Äôt take the steps to get themselves the most money. A vast majority do but you‚Äôre either wrong or being hyperbolic, and the latter wouldn‚Äôt really support your statement so I‚Äôm gonna go with wrong. Loyalty and rings are also important to some players. Cam payne likely took less than he could have gotten this off-season and gets to stay in Phoenix.  Bobby portis probably too. Kemba did not take the steps to get himself the most paid, and he plays for his hometown squad now. Much more valid of an analogy than current lebron or current embiid and that‚Äôs without the fact that Kawhi is injured for an entire season. But yes, I understand that Kawhi took the most money and that‚Äôs why he signed the deal that way in the first place, so he could opt out and resign for even more. Nobody is disputing his motive, there‚Äôs just something to be said for taking a different approach and if you want to just say there‚Äôs nothing to it asides from money then so be it but you‚Äôd be ignoring plenty of past and current decisions that go against that very statement."

"from what I seem, nobody is giving credit to the front office for all the shrewd moves they made.

The reason he was benched was not because he is a terrible defender. He was primarily benched bc Vuc is a terrible defender. Their play together did not mesh at all. Then his value tanked.   Bulls reddit is in a collective frenzy. Markkanen - like Cam Payne, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter etc. - is going to thrive somewhere else. Some other team is going to get him cheap and that is a good outcome."
I feel like you've confused Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker?
Nikola Mirotic and Bobby Portis
You just named two guys who the sub memes about though. Bobby Portis gets the same kind of attention here while being about the same level of player because he makes funny faces.
idk why they didn't try to offer higher bids to some guys like bobby portis or PJ tucker. They didn't even get paid well. I'm sure they could've offered them more and have a more defensive team while cj and dame and shoot the lights out.
Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis was similar for us this year. Fell out of the rotation against the Nets because he was getting absolutely cooked and wasn‚Äôt the guy who could take advantage of them on the other end but the role he played in the other three series (*especially* the Finals) was vital for us. There‚Äôs a lot of value in that even if he does have clear limitations.
"I would be more than glad to see these signings work out, as I was when Jrue, Bobby Portis, and Brynn Forbes exceeded expectations. However for every great signing you have the Mirotics, Augustins, Teagues. I'm optimistic but not overly enthused."
*stares in Bobby Portis*
"I would counter that with the heat signing PJ Tucker, the Nets signing patty mills and the bucks retaining Bobby Portis. Would you consider those teams well run?"
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"

"If Bobby Portis leads the San Diego Padres to a World Series, where does that put him All-Time?"
"I wish Bobby Portis played with him. Bobby cracked Mirotic for way less than the shit Drummond would pull, and would go apeshit if Drummond laid a hand on him for trying to help the team. Fuck Drummond."
Westbrook playoff FGA: 17  Ben playoff FGA: 7  and Ben has a shot chart of a Shaq as a PG. What‚Äôs next? you gonna tell me that Bobby Portis is better 3pt shooter than Steph cause he avg 47% while Steph is measly at 42%? nephew please.
"Joel would have won MVP if he didn‚Äôt go down. When Russ was in OKC Harden was no where better than Joel. Only Durant is comparable to him.  &gt;	Ben just turned 25, Russ is going to be 33 next season  I don‚Äôt think this help your argument at all. The fact that people are split on whether a upcoming young 6‚Äô10‚Äù star is better a 6‚Äô1‚Äù washed up going out of the league in a year or two one speaks volume to how disappointing Ben has been. If ben is what he‚Äôs supposed to be with all that naturally gifted talents then there wouldn‚Äôt be a conversation on this in the first place.   &gt;	Ben was still scoring at a 60 something % clip when he did take shots  yeah cause he takes like 5 shots a game and has a shot chart of Shaq as a PG. Cmon bro whats next? are you gonna tell me Bobby Portis is a better 3pt shooter than Steph cause he shoot 47% on it while Steph is a measly 42%?  &gt;	He wasn't literally handing the ball over to the other team with bricks 11 times per game.  well WB wasn‚Äôt literally handling the ball over to the other team by them playing hack-a-ben. Whenever ben drives to the rim it‚Äôs basically a turnover because you just need to hack him and have him bricks his FTs."
"Nah as much as houston fans will always love mad max, he can be somewhat of an asshole. Bobby Portis comes off as a pretty decent guy with some unfortunate moments and the eyes make him easy to meme as well"
"Absolutely right. Reminds me of the article on here a few weeks ago about Bobby Portis getting his stuff paid for in Walgreens and whatnot. If Bobby gets that treatment, imagine what Giannis gets. And absolutely no disrespect to Bobby P. He deserves his successes. Woo pig."
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."
You see your fair share in Chicago. I saw Giannis at O‚Äôhare international airport when he was a sophomore. He was waiting for his dad to arrive and I even asked him for a picture to which he said no. His mom actually apologized because she thought he was being rude.   I‚Äôve also seen Bobby Portis sitting on a random Michigan Ave bench with a couple of his family members.
"That Mavs roster was low key stacked with great veterans and future hall of famers lol from top to bottom they were a very talented team.   Other then Bobby Portis and I guess Pat Connaughton, the Bucks bench was pretty bad. They really didn't have much depth at all."
"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
is bobby portis wholesome now? i still remember him punching mirotic in the face lol
Bobby Portis tho
"I‚Äôm going to try to also just include mainly role players.    C: Myles Turner  PF: Giannis  SF: KD  SG: Klay Thompson  PG: Jrue Holiday   Bench:  Reggie Jackson  Seth Curry  Matisse Thybulle  Robert Covington  Joe Ingles  Bobby Portis  Brook Lopez     Definitely could be better when some of the non All Star picks but without picking fringe All Stars, I like this team. Jrue was the toughest pick as I wasn‚Äôt sure if CP3, Trae, Booker among others were Superstars so I decided between Jrue and Lowry. Jrue I think fits better with a team like this personally."
Bobby Portis
Yeah this is my #1 favorite Bobby Portis play of all time.
"Nikola Mirotic be like, ""Fuck Bobby Portis, All My Homies Hate Bobby Portis"""
"And just like that, Bobby Portis ensured he would never pay for a meal or a drink in the city of Milwaukee for the rest of his days."
Why would people hate Bobby Portis
Hello 911? Can you send Bobby Portis as fast as you can? Chris Paul is trying to beat me up!
Will always be one of my favorite moments! LOL!  Paul is just such a whiny bitch. I like how CP3 tried to get tough with Portis and Bobby just laughed at him.
ah former wizards legend bobby portis.
Bobby Portis is becoming one of my fav players.  I feel sad that CP was given Foster in the finals. Obviously Foster's never going to let CP win anything. Regardless of what you think of Chris Paul it's fucked up that Foster's so obviously dirty.

I remember when Vonleh was billed as Chris Bosh 2.0. Now he's a poor man's Bobby Portis
"He's a slightly different Bobby Portis, kinda boggles the mind that one is a cult hero and the other's on the outside looking in."
He had good moments for us.. I thought he might have Bobby Portis type arch.
Bobby Portis on his way to Philadelphia right now
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
"Real talk? Cleveland or Detroit. I‚Äôm originally from the land so I would love to live there and be with friends and family while making a top .01% salary and enjoy occasional partying (Cleveland does have good clubs and nightlife, just not Atlanta tier). And Detroit interests me for the same reasons it does Jerami Grant, black city and coach, with a cool up and coming team with a lot of winning history. Plus being a decent but loveable player  in either really sets you up nicely, see Bobby Portis in Milwaukee."
&gt; They played just about as bad as expected.  Sadly no. In the first rebuild season where we were supposed to tank hard to get a good pick in the loaded 2018 draft Bobby Portis decided to punch some sense into Niko Mirotic who turned into Dirk-lite during a small stretch which turned into a winning streak at the end of the season which turned into just the 7th pick.
"Really cause based on [this article wrote by the Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/25/bobby-portis-says-hes-always-been-seen-villain-even-before-he-broke-teammates-face/?outputType=amp) Zach Lavine said that Portis ""was not at fault""."
"NBA: ""Apart from crushing the other Big Four sports leagues in a Freddie Mercury lookalike contest, we don't miss Mirotic""  r/NBA: ""Apart from the Bobby Portis memes, we don't miss Mirotic"""
Bobby Portis &gt; everyone
Bet he misses NBA champion Bobby Portis tho
major NBA star Bobby Portis did one üí™üèæ
Bobby Portis
Zion. Check this Bobby Portis impression: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lszosv/highlight_bobby_portis_gives_us_his_best_zion/
"Stop it, none of those dues shot at the rate or efficiency of even Bobby Portis and the majority of the shots they did take were sub 45% mid range pull ups. Your ignoring the game is played completely different and a lot more efficiently today. Shaqs offensive rating would be absurd in today‚Äôs game, period."
It's amazing how quickly my attitude changed on Trae Young and Bobby Portis.
I think Bobby Portis was interested in us a few seasons ago. There was also that time we had D-Rose for like 10 minutes and then we cut him.
Bobby Portis nearly killed Mirotic
I feel like Bobby Portis has crazy eyes for a reason. Plus he's already punched Mirotic
Bobby Portis
Put some respect on Bobby Portis' name.
"Yeah LeBron his teams are too old I bet for the streak to last long enough. However an interesting one is Jeff Green due to duration and being on a billion different teams.   1999: Kurt Thomas  2000-2002: Shaq 2003: Richard Jefferson 2004: Shaq  2005: Nazr Mohammed  2006: Shaq 2007: Ira Newble/LeBron 2008: KG 2009: JJ Redick 2010: KG 2011: Tyson Chandler  2012: Kevin Durant  2013: Ray Allen 2014: Ray Allen 2015: LeBron  2016: LeBron 2017: LeBron 2018: LeBron 2019: Kevin Durant  2020: LeBron 2021: Jae Crowder   His streak I bet lasts a long time. Teammates already with: Durant, LeBron, Jokic(about to be), Westbrook, Harden, Donovan Mitchell, Gobert, Beal, CP3, Kyrie. That streak will probably last a fair bit. He has ties to all the top teams this year: LAC(Ibaka), LAL, BKN, Den, Utah, Phx, Mil(Bobby Portis), Atl(Lou Will) etc"
"I don't like the extent to which Lebron argues but it's a reflection of the era he's played in. Steph whines too much. Durant whines too much. Fucking enforcers like Bobby Portis whine too much, honestly. It's not a reflection of his personality. The only thing negative on that front is the China stuff, but then, Jordan certainly didn't speak up about sweatshops, even though his sneakers essentially ignited that exploitative industry.  Lebron may get superstar calls but he *doesn't* get calls when people are chopping him up on drives and in the paint. Jordan got superstar calls *and* got rule changes that specifically protected him and made his playstyle more efficient."
"Ok yeah I see what you mean, my bad on making an unfair assumption.  I had the same experience.  I did get a whopping 10% employee discount, which I mean, I guess I would gladly share with Bobby Portis if he came in.    But actually, now that I think about it, they tracked that too and you'd get fired if they caught you on camera using your discount # for someone else's purchase."
"More people are going to go to Walgreens just becuase Bobby Portis went there lol sounds stupid but it's true.   Giannis went to Chick-Fil-A and got a free meal, you should have seen the lines there afterwards, people flocked, it was crazy, like way busier than usual. Same thing happened at the restaurant called Barnicle Buds, after Giannis went there, the place was more packed than usual. People want to go there, just because Giannis ate there. Brings in more business if they are willing to come back."
So we need KAT to finally get mad and pull a Bobby Portis then he‚Äôll go off on a tear and then eventually win a ring ‚Ä¶ though the downside is that Embiid will have to leave the league to play in Cameroon.
"Part of the issue with players of Bens caliber is that he is way tooooo valuable of an asset to let walk over a few million, but as you said, he needs the right players to thrive. So building around him AFTER he has received his extension is hard af. Ben (35M) Tobi (35M) jojo (31M) Danny Green (10M) is already your entire cap space (112M last season).    Stretch bigs are already hard enough to find. The bjelicas, Bobby portis', ilyasovas, they cost more than that. The best stretch big youre going to find for what Philly can spend is luke kornet. I love my guy luke but you would rather have Dwight.    You gave morey some credit but not nearly enough. He turned al horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth curry. I try not to syck morey off as much as the rest of this sub, but truthfully I am not sure if many gms can pull that off."
"\&gt;A gesture towards what?    Towards Bobby Portis? Is this really that confusing?   It is likely contingent on him winning a championship. People like championships. It‚Äôs the highest achievement in the sport of Basketball. Again, not sure why you‚Äôre struggling with this stuff.    You seem lost. You‚Äôre in an /r/nba comment section."
I‚Äôm lmao. Bobby Portis is seriously hilarious.
"Funny story. I was once on a solo road trip and had to pee for like over an hour because I didn‚Äôt want to stop. I had an empty Gatorade bottle and I thought that my flaccid penis would definitely fit inside the wide opening of a Gatorade bottle, ensuring a clean transfer of fluids while driving. After trying for several minutes to get it to fit in the bottle (do not recommend. I was on a solo stretch of road with nobody near me) I had to give up and just pull over.  So moral of the story is that if my flaccid dick doesn‚Äôt fit in a Gatorade bottle, I think an erect Bobby Portis would be severely disappointed."
"you said it man. These people complaining about this probably spend all their money on Twitch streamers and e-thots.  and then Bobby Portis catches shit for actually living in the city that signed him when the alternative is being Ben Simmons and running off to LA the first chance he gets, there's no winning here"
"Again, it was a gesture. Do you understand that concept? Obviously the guy realized that Bobby Portis doesn‚Äôt need help buying Walgreens."
"Get a grip lol, Bobby Portis doesn't deserve free Walgreens for playing good basketball"
"You say that because you‚Äôre stupid. There‚Äôs a FAR greater difference between the wealth and possibilities with that wealth of any one of the worlds 2200+ billionaires and the wealth of Bobby portis than there is between Bobby portis and an average dude.  You‚Äôre too stupid to understand that tho so you just lump anyone with wealth beyond what you can count on your fingers and toes as being ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù, and since wealth=bad...well... that‚Äôs about all the brain power you‚Äôre capable of.  I would say you should be ashamed of yourself but I legit think you‚Äôre too stupid to even experience shame. So instead I‚Äôll just tell you to fuck off and block you. Peace!"
There are over 2200 billionaires and the top eight have as much wealth as half of the entire human race.  Putting fucking Bobby portis in with that group is absurd
"No, not that. Meeting Bobby Portis"
"Bobby Portis is not part of the ""ultra wealthy"""
I'm not rich by any means and being able to tell my friends that I bought a drink for Bobby Portis would be well worth the fifteen bucks lol
"10 years From now:  ‚ÄúAnd now, it‚Äôs time for the Fizer Forum Postgame Show, presented by Milwaukee Ford, with your host Bobby Portis‚Äù."
"Everyone in here being real negative about salary, as a Chicago fan I‚Äôm glad to see Bobby get it on.   Clearly the fans are to, obviously he makes more than them but tell me it wouldn‚Äôt make your day to feed Mr Portis. They aren‚Äôt doing it for a lunch transactional shit, they‚Äôre doing out of love and that‚Äôs dope"
"Giannis Overrated  Since one of yo giannis fanboys want to delete my post I‚Äôm gonna repost it.  Giannis has no skill whatsoever  - He can‚Äôt dribble   - He can‚Äôt Shoot  - He has no IQ (decides to take a fadeaway on JAMES HARDEN)  -Overrated defense he‚Äôs regarded as an all nba 1st team defender yet was scared to guard kd and he has no permitter defense average at best he only has decent post defense   -He‚Äôs not clutch every time the game is on the line guess who gets the ball not Giannis MIDDLETON because giannis is not to trust in the clutch  Now let me get on with this overrated ring he got.  -the whole western conference was injured they played the worst team   -would of lost to the nets   -claims he doesn‚Äôt have a super team(great team) yet bucks beat hawks without him   - kd by himself took them to 7 games   - choked last year, only reason there doing so good this year is because injuries and the addition of jrue holiday was major to there success   - jrue holiday and Middleton don‚Äôt get enough credit the media acts as if giannis carried them, if giannis is not showing up Middleton drops 30 and they jrue holiday to lock up the other team guard like he did with booker  - all the times dropped over 35 he averages 17 free throw attempts   - he was dropping big numbers on one of the worst defensive team in the suns which is why against the heat he only averaged 24 against the heat  -he averages over than half the amount of the suns highest ft player with 85 attempts   -the idea over the casuals is that the bucks team wasn‚Äôt good and Giannis carried them they have jrue holiday, Middleton, brook lopez who saved them with the block on kd, and they got Bobby portis nowhere near a bad team actually a great team  -lost 2 games to a overrated suns team   - both his mvp he got were undeserved harden should of got it then Lebron   -Giannis also averaging the most free throw attempts in a series since Dwade in the 2006 FINALS.    Stop being bias and look at the facts when you put it into context you see how unimpressive it looks."
Bobby Portis played better than Simmons if that was the point you were trying to make.
"MVP: Steph (Klay‚Äôs coming back so they could secure at least a 3 or 4 seed)  DPoY: Giannis or Ben Simmons.   MIP: MPJ. (This is a biased pick. Outside of LeBron and Steph, he‚Äôs my favorite to watch)  ROtY: Cade Cunningham (I‚Äôm going off of Summer league only)  6MoY: Joe Harris or Bobby Portis."
1. Bobby Portis  2-5. Doesn't matter
"Iirc, they were being separated and Mirorich feinted like he was gonna hit bobby and that's when Bobby popped him. Also Mirorich played significantly better post punch, he should thank Portis"
"Starters   PG Jrue   SG Grayson Allen  SF Middleton  PF Giannis   C BroLo   6th Bobby Portis   7th Divincenzo   8th Pat Connaughton   9th George Hill   10th Semi/Rodney Hood/Nwora  Situational Thanasis   Benchwarmers Mamu, Giorgos K  My thinking on Allen over Donte is offensive consistency and availability at the start of the year."
Bobby Portis for sure. I learned way more about him and heard him speak more about his beliefs this year and it really changed my view of him in a positive way.
The lad was repeating the fact that the OP said he can‚Äôt believe Bobby Portis is 26. He thinks it feels like he‚Äôs been in the league for 10 years.
He can‚Äôt believe Bobby Portis is 26. He thinks it feels like he‚Äôs been in the league for 10 years.
Bobby ‚ÄúNBA Champion Bobby Portis‚Äù Portis
I'd say maybe the Hawks but he overlapped with both Iso Joe and then the 60 win Hawks who are more remembered as a team greater than the sum of their parts.  Celts fans liked him too but with their storied history it would be like us bulls fans talking about Bobby Portis 10 years from now.
"Bobby Portis. If he took that deal to get flipped, we are a poverty franchise"
"Dear Dumbass.  Have a think about the Bucks without Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis.  To quote some Daryl Morey or other, the scarce resource in the NBA is not the star player, it is the undervalued player.  And Ben Simmons is being paid a max."
That part of the clip with Bobby Portis is amazing too. Man what a guy.
"I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a buy low-sell high kind of thing. Small-ball has been dominant the last decade, so bigs are relatively cheap, but it wouldn‚Äôt take much for that trend to change. In fact, with Giannis dominating in the finals, aided by effective performances from Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, there may be a run on bigs by contenders. If so, Cleveland is poised to make bank. So it‚Äôs a gamble, but it may be one that‚Äôs about to pay off‚Ä¶"
Hopefully they don't nerf him or Bobby Portis in the next patch tho
PG: Patrick Beverley  SG: Kevin Porter Jr  SF: Marcus Morris  PF: Jae Crowder  C: Bobby Portis
"I mean, we've made the playoffs every year after that season and now have a championship. Can't argue with results!  On the real, though, I don't actually hate it in the long-term. It's atrocious in the short-term, don't get me wrong, but odds are at least one of them ends up being worth something in a trade. If you're not going to land a marquee player in FA and if you don't have massive contracts to give out, you can do worse than overload at a position and hope that you can leverage one of them into some form of other asset via trade. The Knicks were memed into oblivion when they signed every power forward they could in 2019, but it actually worked out for them in the long term. Randle turned out to be far better a player for them than just a human beyblade, Morris turned into a first round pick, and Gibson was a respectable rotation player for them. That's not counting Bobby Portis, who's obviously a damn fine player but didn't actually get turned into assets for them. Easily have seen worse ways of building out a roster, I'll say that much."
Harden and Irving belong there as well he says. And these guys decided to team up with KD just to be able to beat Bobby Portis.
Pat Bev  Harden with no beard  AD  Robin Lopez  Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis. I feel he'd knock out a ref tbh
"No state reps their players as hard as Arkansas. Bobby Portis is basically a god there, idk how Scottie messed that one up"
Arkansas loves Bobby Portis no doubt
I guess weird note but how does Arkansas feel abt Bobby Portis
"Would you consider him a 4? I‚Äôd certainly put Durant well above him. Bertans too. And Danilo. And is Roco a 4? I think I want him too. And Jae.  As far as 5s? KAT and Jokic are both much much better shooters at this point in their careers  As far as Tweener guys I‚Äôm taking JJJ as a 3 point shooter over love for sure. Batum shot 40% this year too. Honestly Bobby Portis had a really solid year from the 3 as well.   KLove has averaged 37% from 3 over the last 3 seasons combined, I think him being the best shooter at his position is pretty overstated"
"Why the disrespect to the champs?  The bucks showed with Bobby last year that a stretch 4 who doesn't offer a ton on D can be a good fit. Portis really revitalized his career in that role.  I think love would be a great fit in small ball Giannis at center lineups stretching the floor, crashing the boards, and hiding on D, and get minutes over Portis there.    LA offers that same type of role but I think in Brooklyn he'd be pressed with more defensive responsibility just because they don't have the same quality front court defenders."
"He would pair well with Giannis though, he spreads the floor, rebounds, while Giannis protects the rim and plays in the paint. You basically just listed the 3 guys on the whole team that can even play either the 4 OR the 5, there is plenty of playing time to go around. Bobby Portis isn‚Äôt going to play 30 minutes a game."
"Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo minutes at C."
"Tie between Giannis, Jokic, and Klay among stars.  Bobby Portis among role players."
Bobby Portis
Crazy Eyes Bobby Portis
"They've had comparable rosters, outside of khris Middleton on Jrue this year everyone has been a role players/journeymen   Eric bledsoe,Bryn Forbes,sterling brown, pat connaughton, brook lopez,bobby Portis,George hill and a bunch of other people who either aren't in the league or deep bench players"
"Far from the best but...  D Rose, Rondo, Jimmy Butler, Bobby Portis, Thad Young  Bench: Cam Payne, Otto Porter, Wendell, Justin Holiday"
all he did was insert bobby portis. even i knew to do that
"good answer but so are Kris Middleton, Brook Lopez and Jrue.  [Also never forget Bobby Portis high fiving the guy that blocked him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ocfglz/highlight_bobby_portis_is_the_kind_of_guy_that/)"
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
Thats OG Bobby Portis
The Bucks will win the next 5 Championships and Bobby Portis will be 3x Finals MVP from 2023-2025
I find it hard to believe 1 of Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis isn't too 125.
"Bobby portis, easy choice"
"He played 17 minutes a night in the finals.   He's an awful defender, he'd never be able to get starter's minutes on a competitive team for that reason. Just imagine Bobby Portis trying to anchor a defense lol"
"Brook averaged 3.5 offensive rebounds in the finals and averaged 22 min per game. As much as he got cooked defensively he was bullying on the other end and the bucks still dominated points in the paint. Bobby portis played a huge role too. The bucks had 79 offensive boards in the series to the suns 42. This helped the bucks overcome the suns offensive efficiency. When Giannis went down against Atlanta, there were lots of minutes where Bobby and brook shared the floor to win those games. Bucks absolutely bullied the hawks in those minutes."
"Bobby Portis and Semi Ojeleye are back tonight and will be playing; think that just leaves Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo on the injury list."
"Well, not any. You could spot Bobby Portis by his crazy eyes."
oh god      Chicago Bobby Portis was wild
Nba champion Bobby Portis‚Ä¶
"Delivered by Bobby ""Break Your Teammates' Jaw"" Portis"
Plus not having to see Bobby Portis at least twice a year. Those eyes. Those damned eyes...
Yeah in most people's eyes dray would bring that down. It's okay tho. Warriors are awesome in their own right.   Bucks have bobby Portis too so it's hard to beat that.   All love ‚ô•Ô∏è
Pat is basically our 7th guy if you decide Bobby Portis is the 6th man. I'm wondering if you watched the rest of the playoffs after getting swept because Pat had significant minutes and made huge plays all the way
"i mean... that sounds fine until we reframe this. you gonna sit Giannis in the 4th q of a playoff game for bobby portis? Bron for THT? I'm not negging hot hand, but when the stakes are serious i'm not playing a bench dude over my best player and i doubt most of y'all downvoters would disagree."
Errmm.. you forgot Bobby Portis?  I guess Leonard for a 3rd string is not too bad
"The defending champs were missing 3 starters plus another 3 bench rotation players lol you didn‚Äôt beat us healthy and we win that game if Jrue, Donte, Brook, Semi, Bobby Portis, and Hood all play."
League not ready for Bobby Portis at PG
No on the Bulls when [he punched Mirotic.](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bobby-portis-punches-nikola-mirotic-breaking-bones-mirotics-face)
"üòÇAd is deezed but for some reason (probably the video) he doesn‚Äôt scare me. Bobby Portis on the other hand, those eyes‚Ä¶"
Oh man Dwight would be exactly what we need. Come on AD and Dwight pull the ol‚Äô Bobby Portis v Nikola Mirotic
This is all coming off a finals showdown between two Bulls Legends: Cam Payne and Bobby Portis. It's Bulls all the way down
"The Knicks already had a max cap spot. That‚Äôs enough for Morris and Randle as is. So the cap you cleared from the trade turned into Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Elfrid payton and co.   Your last point has nothing to do with the trade either. I don‚Äôt care about your hypotheticals, especially since you clearly have some bias towards the Knicks. The fact of the matter is KP and hardaway played large offensive roles in one of the leagues best offences. And as much as I love Luka, it wasn‚Äôt even close to a carry job on his part at least in the regular season. The team proved more than capable with him benched and injured   And the reason for KP‚Äôs ejection is irrelevant. The fact is as a result of the trade the Mavs have been a highly competitive mid tier playoff team."
"The cap space you already have was enough for Randle and Morris. So the cap space you acquired from the trade went to Elfrid payton and Bobby Portis and Wayne Ellington. So was that worth it? No. The picks could be but they haven‚Äôt conveyed yet. To be worth it those two picks, likely in the 20-30 range will have to be as good or better than the players lost in KP and THJ.  And saying Randle is a top 20 player is a stretch to everybody that‚Äôs not a Knicks fan. All NBA doesn‚Äôt determine where a player ranks, it‚Äôs influenced by record, injuries and other basketball politics factors. By that logic Deandre Jordan and Ben Simmons and the like were top 15 players when they got the nods"
Not when they had a max spot in the first place that would‚Äôve allowed them to sign Randle and Morris who became quickly. So basically the cap they freed up from the trade got them Bobby Portis Elfrid payton and Wayne Ellington
"&gt; whatever ""cap space"" was cleared so they could sign Bobby Portis and Elfrid Payton along with Julius Randle isnt actually part of the trade  It is tho"
"Do people really think the Knicks won the trade, nobody won lol, and whatever ""cap space"" was cleared so they could sign Bobby Portis and Elfrid Payton along with Julius Randle isnt actually part of the trade it's just a rationalization people make up to feel better about their team and the move"

Somewhere Bobby Portis is nodding in approval
"Jrue, Grayson Allen, Khris, Giannis, Brook  George Hill, Connaughton, Jordan Nwora, Semi, and Bobby Portis"
"It‚Äôs like comparing Wilt to Bobby Portis. AD out of shape, can‚Äôt shoot, can‚Äôt make shit. I‚Äôm so disappointed."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
"3&amp;D wings are the easy answer here, so I‚Äôll try to say something different. I think  bench guys who can play either the 4 or 5 and at least be respectable on at least a mid-range jumper are huge. Whether it be somebody like Daniel Theis, Kurt Thomas, Serge Ibaka, Robert Horry, or Bobby Portis, having somebody like that to provide both depth and flexibility is a huge asset."
Bobby Portis.
"it was a move that was too criticized for how it affected the team.    sign and trade Brogdon net us RJ Hampton, Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill.    RJ Hampton was traded alongside George Hill, Eric Bledsoe and picks for Jrue Holiday.    not having Brogdon on the contracts (under the tax) allowed us have MLE to sign DJ Augustin and Bobby Portis.    DJ Augustin was traded for PJ Tucker.    Sam Merill was traded for Grayson Allen.    in all comes down to hindsight, but not signing Brogdon has 1) still allowed us to win a title, 2) go over the tax and have a core of Giannis-Khris-Jrue for the next ~4 years, and 3) netted us Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, and Jordan Nwora who will all be in the rotation going forward.     on the other hand, if the Bucks had extended Brogdon, we still may win a chip in 2020 or 21 (not guaranteed obviously) but is that with Brogdon as the starting PG, or was he traded anyway for a higher tier player (could be Jrue, could be CP3)."
"i'm sorry but that's just a ridiculous statement. Bobby Portis was not more valuable than Lopez at any point in the playoffs, and he was actively detrimental to the team in the Brooklyn series which was the toughest opponent Milwaukee played."
"&gt; New coach, new scheme, new role?  The first two of these three were big, his role was actually significantly diminished and he even commented in an interview that he didn't have a play ran for him all year. Ultimately Bobby should get 90% of the credit. He started working with a new (I think) shot doctor which massively improved his shot, and I think there's clear markers (not *just* the fact that he shot 47% from 3 after a previous range of 36-40%) where he as a player has improved.  That said; Giannis and Bud's system (it's hard to untangle which is which) does *amazing* things for shooters and bigs who are shooters. By the end of the regular season, every member of the Bucks who wasn't there the previous season - with the sole exception of PJ Tucker - shot career high TS%. For all the problems in the playoffs Jrue, who is 31 years old, had a career year in shooting and joined an extremely exclusive club of guard's who finished the season 50%+ from the field. For Bobby's outside shooting I'd attribute it to two things;  * The gravity of Giannis - he drags so many defenders away, especially those with the size to contest without fouling, which means Portis is getting more open looks  * Bud really likes playing guards in the dunker spot, or on the baseline ready to cut; what this achieves is making smaller players play interior defense which very few of them can actually do. This helps a lot of things in the offense, but specifically for Bobby it means his defender is either a big who has to defend him on the perimeter (not good), a guard (not good) or its a big who is hanging a little further in the paint than they would otherwise because they'll need to play help when the guard fails to prevent a cut or they've become one of the players trying to stop Giannis.  Outside of the 3PT thing which is one of the main draws, he's personally attributed the atmosphere and culture (a lot of newer players have talked about the culture in positive terms regarding on court accountability and the focus) as helping him improve on defense - which he has. The fact that he's usually on the court with either Brook or Giannis has prevented some remaining defensive short-comings (specifically rim defense) from being exploited as much.  Basically, the TL;DR for scheming and coaching is that the Bucks system is symbiotic with stretch big's; not only do they help Giannis a lot, but in return they often get advantageous matchups that gives them very easy access to 3's and mid-range shots. The other factor is that Bobby has just improved as a player, he plays defense more intelligently, his shot has improved, and he's taking care of his mental stuff in a way that has helped him flourish on court."
I think an interesting aspect of it is shown in his shot charts from 2020 and 2021 respectively.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/bobby-portis-2020-shot-chart  [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/bobby-portis-shot-chart-2021](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/bobby-portis-shot-chart-2021)  You can tell from this alone he's more knowledgeable of where he can get the most done offensively and he/his team are doing much better at getting him to those spots.
Bobby Portis with even more eye bulges this year
"I only didn't count Bobby as I generally consider him a PF! I don't know how much of it is homer stuff but given he picked up vote(s?) for 6moy (I know Ernie on Inside voted for him) I really do think Portis was one of the best bench players in the league and in terms of big me it's him, Chris Boucher and Montrezl Harrell."
"Lmao this is so incorrect I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.  The funniest part was when you called Evan Fournier, Mitchell Robinson, and Derrick Rose ‚Äúrole players‚Äù like they are Bobby Portis or Stanley Johnson."
"he can hit threes and play defense, and they didnt have a clear replacement lined up, apparently Baze wanted a multi year full MLE and the Warriors were like, heres a Bobby Portis deal, so he threw a hissy fit and left"
"Man if he could solidify himself as the third scoring option for the Bucks they would be wild. I know Per 36s are fucked but he put up 22.5/8/1/2/1 last year on 46/45(!)/76.  A starting lineup of Jrue, Donte, Khris, Giannis, and Lopez with a bench unit of George Hill, Grayson Allen, Nwora, Thanasis, Rodney Hood, Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton, and the rest of the guys could be pretty wild. Crazy strong secondary, not to mention a crazy *crazy* secondary."

"No chalking it up to basic roster changes and giannis ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù is lazy. The giannis point proves my point even more.  Giannis has not been a bad playoff player. He‚Äôs played very well in most of the series he‚Äôs played in historically. The two exceptions are Miami and Toronto. Those teams had a rare combo of size , mobility, coaching and defensive prowess to use a ‚Äúwall‚Äù to guard giannis. Giannis hasn‚Äôt improved as a post player or a shooter. He still has those limitations. The main difference is for the first time, Bud decided this year to use him in off ball sets so you‚Äôre not asking him to create all the time when he‚Äôs not capable. Giannis became a roll man, something a lot of NBA fans have wanted to see for ages but something that was never even experimented with, and it was a huge part of their success.  Bud also historically does not adjust. He doesn‚Äôt change the game plan or who‚Äôs getting the majority of minutes depending on how teams are playing him. That was especially key in the raps series where Milwaukee started off hot but the raps adjusted to them. This year was different. Sometimes Bobby Portis didn‚Äôt play at all. Sometimes he played just as much as brook. Sometimes Middleton was a catch and shoot guy, other times he was a primary play initiator. Sometimes bryn Forbes was plugged in for a spark plug, sometimes he didn‚Äôt see a minute all game. He adjusted his rotation and how players were being used dependent on their matchups. That was a huge part of their success and it‚Äôs something bud has never done before, which was especially glaring when Bledsoe was playing like complete trash and bud was still trying to close games with him.   He also decided to play his players playoff minutes for the first time this year. Usually his stars play 34-35 minutes per game in the playoffs like it‚Äôs the regular season. He refused to give his players major minutes despite it being a very common playoff practice, which lead to having inferior bench lineups out there far too much against teams like Toronto and Miami that were playing their stars 40-43 minutes. This year bud actually played his stars a ton of minutes.  Perhaps saying their failures were all due to bud is hyperbolic, but the vast majority were"
"It's not one or the other; they made other signings that increased the luxury tax (George Hill, Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen). What they're giving is the reason why - out of all the other options to prevent an enormous luxury tax bill - it was PJ Tucker who left."
"He was getting it in the right place even in 2020. The main difference is that instead of Bledsoe and co. bricking those shots you had Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis iirc turning into flamethrowers and of course, Middleton being Middleton."
Bobby Portis' last victim.
Bobby Portis
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever. Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind), so I expect him to have the same impact Jrue had for the Bucks. Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points. All Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then. Khris Middleton did have good series. Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat."
"So Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis weren't good that series? That's ignoring the key players who weren't newcomers that we still have btw, Giannis, Middleton and Lopez.We also have a player than Forbes in Grayson Allen this time around, so that point is absolutely moot.  Heat didn't only get swept, they got blown out badly in of those games. Lowry doesn't change that."

Bobby Portis doesn't have the patience to evolve a Milotic foh.
Bobby Portis would not be aiming for his arm!
I‚Äôm gonna be honest and admit I got him confused with Bobby Portis from the Mirotic thing.
"Nah, absolutely not, no. They had Giannis who is the most dominant finisher in the last 15 years, Jrue Holiday arguably the best 3&amp;D guard in the NBA, Khris Middleton who is arguably one of the best all around wings in the NBA, and a supporting cast of extremely solid role players like Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker. This is just incorrect."
Bucks bench: George hill/Grayson Allan/Pat Connington/Semi ojeleye/Jordan nwora/Bobby Portis
"You have to bring up the other side of the coin because defense is half the game of basketball.   Trae and Luka aren‚Äôt great defenders either, that‚Äôs correct. Although, they are the leaders of their teams so they‚Äôve had strong defensive players placed around them that DEN can‚Äôt do as naturally with offensive dynamos Jokic and Murray. And in Trae‚Äôs case specifically, he‚Äôs a PG so he isn‚Äôt typically matched up one-on-one with the opposing team‚Äôs best player as Luka and MPJ would be more often.  I also think we as fans have a tendency to overrate the defense of our own players. Bad defenders become okay ‚Äúteam defenders‚Äù that are making strides and just need a couple tweaks, when the reality is they‚Äôre just bad defenders. Even on the Bucks heading into the playoffs last year, I heard arguments for guys like Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, and Bobby Portis being serviceable on that end, when frankly, they were major liabilities for stretches. If MPJ truly can become a neutral defender that would be huge for the Nuggets progression, I‚Äôm just not sure how likely it is."
There is no way they do at this point unless he comes back playing like Mirotic did to escape from Bobby Portis

"Mid level players who are too smart to pull what Dennis Schroeder just did, for one. Ingram just signed 5 years for NOLA. Bertans 5 years for DC. Hayward 4 years in Charlotte. VanVleet just signed a 4 year. Plenty of mid level players that aren't going to be the #1 guy signing 4 or 5 year deals.   They can choose shorter deals for chances at rings. Ibaka just signed for 2 for the Clippers. Harrell Signed for 2 on the Lakers. Bobby Portis for 2 to run it back in Milwaukee. Millsap is giving Denver 1 year.  Short term deals for rings, long term deals for job security. That's the dynamic that's going to play out with all this player empowerment. Stars do not need job security, they are in the highest demand."
"Giannis went Super Saiyan, and Bobby Portis became Charles Oakley. We also lost Saric and Cam Payne, which meant we had to play Abdel fucking Nader and Torrey Craig for significant minutes. The Bucks were just better than us in the end. Different story this year, I think. JaVale McGee, Shamet, and the development of Bridges and Cam Johnson are all a significant upgrade from last year's supporting cast."

"20 years from now, imagine a kid from Milwaukee who witnessed last year's title team in search of completing a vintage collection of the whole squad's signed basketball cards and finds a desperate broke ass Giannis trying to sell his original signed Bobby Portis in mint condition"
"I'm not sure Allen is a much better player now than who he was with the Grizzlies, just now he's in a dream system and got to play as the first target for Giannis' passing so averaged an absurd amount of open threes. A bit like how Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis last season wouldn't have shot 47/45% from 3 on another team, I think some of Graysons scoring is that he's in the absolute perfect system for himself."
"Giannis, if you squander hundreds of millions of dollars,  what makes you think you could handle all the fortunes that would come from selling a signed Bobby Portis card?"
He could just get one of his own cards and sign it for more money. I don‚Äôt know shit about cards but Im pretty sure a 2021 Giannis card will be worth more than any Bobby Portis card.
"Bobby Portis base sells for $1-$2. Bobby Portis autos sell for &lt;$100, actually closer to $50-$60. Giannis makes $27.5m this year. Giannis would need 55,000 copies of anyone not in the top 25 players to make 10% of his salary. That‚Äôs why no one has done this. Hardly worth his time."
I suddenly want a Signed Bobby Portis Rookie Card. I haven't collected Sports cards since 1991.
ESPN: Giannis turns Bobby Portis into a backup.
"Wouldn‚Äôt they be worth more money if he signed the cards? Also, that would be pretty confusing ‚Äúhey look at the Giannis signed Bobby Portis card?????‚Äù"
I was JUST standing next to Bobby Portis as he rubbed lotion over his torso and joked about smelling good for his wife when he got home...This business is insane. He and his family's lives changed that fast.
I'm not sure a signed Bobby Portis card is really the secret to financial independence
"You could tell he was struggling with the losing early on.  We had to rely on a lot of guys that not only aren't the most talented but were new to the system.  Giannis had to play Center all the time before Bobby came back and you could tell it was wearing on him physically.  Once Jrue and Bobby were both back, it made us look like the team from last year again. I'm actually really excited to see what happens when Donte and Brook come back.  Our rotation then will be Giannis, Khris, Jrue, Brook, Grayson, Connaughton, Portis, Hill, and probably a few minutes of Cousins.  That's fucking deep."
"Great defensive play, but that's Bobby Portis. I'm more confident in him hitting wide open threes than contested layups"
"Jerami Grant - 20m  Bobby Portis - 4.3m  i would even argue that Portis is better, just didn't have that luck of getting traded into absolutely terrible team where he could be number 1 or 2 option"
Bobby Portis is healthy.  Just split the center.minutes between those two.  30 for Bobby 18 for Giannis.  The Bucks play small at the 4 with Pat and Kris a lot anyway.  Also Semi plays the 4 and he's a guy.
"Oooh I‚Äôm so scared, let me try now  *Bobby Portis*"
"Nah, it‚Äôs rather a frowned upon move because the general consensus is that you want to bring a guy like PJ Tucker back after how much you relied on him thru the championship run.  He was great for them against Heat and Nets. He was instrumental in that he unlocked Giannis at the 5 and let Bucks play a more switchable defense. That is crucial and they miss that this year. Bobby Portis won‚Äôt see the floor against certain match up and he def didn‚Äôt see the floor against the Nets. Same if you go down the line of Pat Connaughton, Jordan Nwora, Semi Ojeleye‚Ä¶ those guys can‚Äôt provide what Tucker brought"
Bobby Portis
Donte Divincenzo and Bobby Portis
Not showing a lot of promise so far. You could get the same value at cheaper price with Bobby Portis
"DFG%, because of how it's tracked, is really only useful for players who are defending at the rim.  Beside that, here are three obvious ways to have a good DFG%:  * Playing lockdown defense  * Guarding the opposing team's worst offensive player  * Guarding players who take a lot of threes   DFG% belongs nowhere near a measurement of a guard's defense, especially this early in the season and means maybe even less than nothing. Bobby Portis by that metric is one of the better defenders in the league and it is simply untrue."
This is actually pretty funny because Bobby Portis shot 47% from 3 last season and is currently shooting 46% from 3 this season.
Maybe it's fucked up comparing a 6 foot guard to Bobby Portis?
It's fucked up that Raptors fans keep downvoting me when I say how Bobby Portis is a better defender than Kyle Lowry.
"Drop Grayson Allen and I'll agree with that.  I was talking about that with my brother-in-law recently. He's very, very sad about the Bucks having Allen, because he loves Giannis and really liked the Bucks but he haaaaates Grayson Allen. He doesn't like Bobby Portis either, but we have Draymond so call that a wash.  Outside of Draymond, the Warriors really don't have an unlikable player.  (I like Draymond. I am a Warriors fan. I accept this opinion is extremely not universal.)  The Bucks are mostly a really likable team apart from First Team All Chode Grayson Allen and teammate-puncher Bobby Portis, and those two being there does make me sad too."
"They've collected some really hateable players, while not having anyone lovable enough to offset that.  Like, the Bucks have absolute tools like Grayson ""literally everything about the way he plays and his Ted Cruz face"" Allen and Bobby ""How About I Punch This Teammate"" Portis, but no-one hates the Bucks because they still have Giannis and everyone loves Giannis.  Whereas the Heat have allowed their team's leader to become Jimmy Butler, who seems to be incapable of just being professional about literally anything. He's all about the petty aggression... so long he's at a safe distance.  See: mouthing off from the bench but not, like, when he was anywhere near Jokic after the incident with Morris, and then holding photo shoots in the corridor knowing they'd get cleared out of their before they so much as laid eyes on the Nuggets."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"As a Bulls fan, I can't help but root really hard for Bobby Portis! I'm glad he's having success!"
Yeah I‚Äôd bet Bobby Portis would be a hard guy to miss in a crowd
Every team would love to have a player like Bobby Portis.

"Imagine getting to have Grayson Allen, Bobby Portis, *and* Pat Connaughton as players on your basketball team."
CP3 was hobbled throughout the western conference playoffs last year but I agree I‚Äôm worried about him. His hand went limp in the finals and he went from spinning Bobby Portis like a load of laundry to fumbling the ball on a simple crossover and getting stripped by Portis in a span of 4 games. Still hurts. We lost bc we only had one big man though. Ayton had to play too cautious which won‚Äôt work on Giannis
Don't forget crazy eyes Bobby Portis!
"i actually strangely kinda agree with stephen A here but i think he should have argued it differently. lebron is not seen as a crazy person or a psychopath like MJ or Kobe were seen as. he comes across more jovial and accessible - as a player i think hes clearly better than kobe and probably better than MJ but hes not a lunatic. he could have argued that MJ and Kobe had more crazy-eyes bobby portis in their overall aura than lebron does, so they were less 'fucked with' on and off the court. when JJ was incredulously saying 'who's come after lebron?' i think there are plenty of people - paul pierce, KG, klay+dray, noah, plenty of people like that over the years. so when stephen A is saying he's not talking about basketball i kinda see what he means. he could have won that argument he just said it kinda weird"

Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis takes exception with your statement
"It‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs setting a screen? It just looks like LeBron is moving down the lane to potentially receive the inbounds pass.  The offensive player does not need the ball to charge over someone and it be called a charge.  And yes, LeBron does purposefully run into Steph. I can‚Äôt tell if he rocked his stones or his inner thigh, but either way that collision was intentional and to me it looks more like LeBron trying to bully smaller Steph out of the way for an easy layup.  That throw down on that screen clip is a pretty obvious wtf.  I have watched LeBron since he got drafted on and off over the years, but I‚Äôm only trying to analyze what I see in these exact clips and try to imagine what I think is happening based on the players, their personalities they show, and my time spent playing on a High School State Championship Basketball team. (Obviously not the highest level, but I have played around some pretty great players, including Bobby Portis of all people lol)."
"Yeah I understand your point but I think we are at the point where we know Giannis will be good at whatever role he plays on the team ( except a spot up shooter from the corner üòÑ) the problem is even with a healthy brook Lopez and donte ,the bench is not NBA caliber for the most part . And there isn't a guy that can play small ball 4 next giannis at the 5 like Pg tucker . The closing lineup always had brook Lopez out because he gets targeted, now Bobby Portis gets targeted as well."
You guys tried this once with Bobby portis remember?
Bobby Portis punched Mirotic so hard he woke up in Spain with the S.
Bobby Portis is a weird one to include. In a way he's kinda the opposite of what I think of when I think of an empty stats guy. He's more like a bluecollar type roleplayer who does a lot of dirty work.
People who put up stats on non winning teams because it‚Äôs easy to blame them for losses  Bobby Portis  Zach Lavine  Devin Booker  Dwight   Wiggins  TJ Warren
"I feel like this happened to Bobby Portis last night for us, started out 6/6 from deep and then got two good opportunities that he passed up before taking his final three which he missed"
"Guys it might be too early to say, but I think Bobby Portis will win MVP"
Bobby Portis &gt; Orlando Magic franchise
Best shooters in the NBA:  1) Bobby Portis  2) curry or buddy hield maybe idk
Bucks have 2 very friendly contracts in Bobby Portis and Grayson allen
"If we‚Äôre talking true friendliness to the team, Bobby Portis just resigned with the bucks at a huge discount"
I watch bucks games for hype bobby portis plays
"This is extremely disastrous. Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, Khris Middleton - all our best shooters - have 1 FGA attempt this quarter. Please give them the ball."
"I like watching Coach Bud‚Äôs Bucks because they always play random. I never know what they‚Äôre going to do.   I remember one time Bobby Portis was about to inbound the ball, but instead of passing it in he got down on one knee and proposed to the guard waiting for the pass. Everyone was stunned and the Bucks won the game."
Yeah it‚Äôs true.  Most recent championship former Knick was Bobby Portis.
"We‚Äôre actually on the team, OP is Bobby Portis"
This was Middletons first game back.  Only the 4th game he played all season.  Donte hasn't played a game.  Brook hasn't played since the first game.  Jrue came back last week after missing 8 games.  Bobby Portis played his 5th game of the season.

"Just quickly checked in, how did Bobby Portis just get like fifty offensive rebounds"
Bobby Portis still haunts my dreams
"Bobby Portis is kind of like a big Steph Curry - elite shooting from anywhere on the court, can't defend centres."
And to think some guy on r/nbadiscussion said Bobby Portis wasn‚Äôt a good player lmao
"People hate on him way too much it‚Äôs ridiculous. What are people expecting out of him to be so gung ho about his job security?   He did what needed to be done. He made the adjustments that needed to be made. He experimented with the rotations and the strategy during the season and rolled things out as needed. He maximized bench players like Bobby Portis in critical times and let them roll with the strategies as needed. He literally closed out the ECF without Giannis back and ready to play. I repeat this for emphasis, he won without his two time MVP generational genetic freak athlete player to win the eastern conference.   I swear the only way people on this sub would be satisfied is if he went 4-0 every single round of the playoffs and even then people would probably complain about the games being too close. Just shut the fuck up and accept the fact that he won."
No need to bring Bobby Portis into this
Magic shaq is quick asf. I think he would basically be a giannas or taller zion. The game changes base off generational players.   Shaq is one of the main reasons people started shooting jumpshots and not wanting to play center.   Defense just make him a on the best help defenders. Play a zone defense.   A modern day shaq team would be like.   Lonzo-  zach lavine - Robert covington-  Marcus Morris- Shaq   Ricky rubio- Paul George- Harrison Barnes- Bobby Portis- Shaq   Last Deaaron fox- Duncan Robinson- kawhi- joe ingles- Shaq
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
"Giannis playing center and the whole team make up looks like the AD- Jrue Pelicans   We got 3 guards in the starting line up, couple of SF/ PF guy that really provides nothing, some undersize wing playing at the 3. A stretch 4 next to Giannis playing C  So Jrue playing Jrue role Giannis doing everything on both ends like AD did George Hill playing the Tim Frazier role Grayson Allen playing the Eric Gordon role Pat Connaughton playing Dante Cunningham  Bobby Portis playing Nikola Mirotic   It‚Äôs just not very good."

Watch bobby portis drop like 25 or something against the bulls and you'll see why it's MSG
"In a sense, one of the secrets to Randle's success is that he's finally on a team that gave him a shot to lead, and he was ready for it.   All this time he was like Christian Wood. LA didn't care to develop him (they didn't want to be patient with D'Lo or Lonzo either), Pelicans thought he's not worth retaining, and no other team made him a priority in free agency because of his ball dominant post-play. Everybody wants 3/D and ""stretch big"" skills.  He ends up on the Knicks as a short term gamble (alongside another talented gamble in Bobby Portis). He finds himself on a young team willing to let him lead, with a no-nonsense old-school coach, and his 3pt shooting also took a huge turn around at the perfect time.  He's the perfect MIP, both due to circumstance and skill."
Kemba broke tf outta that guy that played in Chicago that Bobby Portis fought (forgot his name)
"Your team is beyond stacked. If Bryn has an off night, 40+% 3Pt% Bobby Portis is the next man up."
I feel you. We went through a phase of people wanting to trade Brook and replace him with Bobby Portis/Mamadi Diakite in January...
Jae crowder and olynk massacred the bucks last year.  Jrue is a huge gain...Bobby Portis is a positive...pj tucker is also positive.  Pat c....God bless his soul...is the 8th man in the rotation this year vs basically being the 6th man last year.   Bucks are a grittier more experienced and more talented team.
We got Bobby Portis!
Bobby Portis - Swag
"idk who Jordan Clarkson is either, my man. Bum status.     Bobby Portis: - ONLY NBA non-starter to avg at least 10p &amp; 7r   \- 52.3% FG ranks 25th (none of 3 finalists are top 45)   \- 47.1% 3pt FG ranks 3rd (better than 3 finalists, all guards)   \- 12 dbl-dbls (3 finalists w/3 combined)"
If our lineup can't run dedmon off the floor I think we'd just match with Bobby Portis on dedmon and we lose no spacing.
Sure. Patterson was a bad comp because he literally has no role and just exists to eat minutes and do cardio.   It would be more like posting a Bobby Portis 1-5 statline which would also be stupid.
"James Johnson, good MMA fighter, he‚Äôs about it. Jimmy Butler is also about it. Bobby Portis. That‚Äôs about it tho"
Really I only take issue with asking random fans why their org is the way it is. All your other points are things I agree with. I'm a Bucks fan and very happy with how they handled everything. The closest we came to escalation was Bobby Portis pushing Heat guys around to clear space for Giannis to stand.
Dude what was that. Why is it ok in this sport to do shit like that.  Like football is a massive contact sport but ANY amount of tussling or unnecessary roughness is treated like a cardinal sin and the player gets absolutely clowned on by the league and fans.  Meanwhile the heat players are already losing by 30 and trying to injure or just piss of Giannis and their coach is just letting them happen with the punishment being a single free throw.  If I was Bobby Portis after the Giannis thing I might have socked dragic in the face that was some ultra scrublord  shit from him.
Bobby Portis boutta smack some people up next time round lol
Bro have you see Bobby Portis?
Bobby Portis should have been nominated over one of the two(!?) Jazz players.
LMAO!!!!! BOBBY PORTIS Better than this bum.
I'd understand if he were left off a few. But somebody out there really thinks Shake Milton was a better 6th man? Bobby Portis? Campazzo? Some of those votes must have left him off given how many ballots he wasn't on.
If I'm the Heat I'm not fucking around when Bobby Portis comes through.
why cant they just accept the loss and not be bitches.    good on the bucks for not playing dirty.  Even brooke lopez and bobby portis who im pretty sure are serial killers in another universe are keeping their composure.

Wishing nothing but success for Knicks legend Bobby Portis üôè
"yup! iirc him, Bobby and Torrey Craig showed up on the same day. one of the better bench moves we‚Äôve made recently, i stan Portis and Forbes has stepped up more over the season"
"Bobby ""Michael"" Portis Jr."
No doubt there will be a Bobby Portis game
"The Bulls have a habit of sending their bigs out into the world to fuck shit up, we go through them so quickly. Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah, Omer Asik, Threekola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter Jr., Daniel Gafford. Next in line is Lauri Markkanen."
Bobby Portis
Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis made leaps in shooting 3s too  Fizdale is such a fraud I swear to god
"Luke's never had a stretch as bad as Fizdale at the Knicks though.   Fizdale went 21-83 with the Knicks and had the worst spacing in the league despite having Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Reggie Bullock who would all go on to shoot over 40% from deep the year after he left. He's not only a shit coach but he makes players significantly worse"
Bobby Portis and Mirotic
"When Giannis wins this one, it‚Äôll be a better legacy boost than if he had won either of the two prior championships.  We might have had ‚Äúbetter‚Äù teams by record and net rating those years, but this year the squad is way better to anyone whose watched all 3 years.   Having Jrue as an upgrade to Bledsoe for real is going from like Leandro Barbosa to Steve Nash.   Bobby Portis is actually very capable, competent and most notably confident bench scorer."
Bobby Portis shot 47% from 3 this season??? And no one is mentioning it in the comments??? He shot 36% last year!
&gt; **The Deadshot Award (presented by Ray Allen/Reggie Miller)** &gt;  &gt; best qualifying 3 point percentage (Basketball-Reference): &gt; &gt; 1.    Joe Harris (47.5%) &gt; 2.    Marcus Morris (47.3%) &gt; 3.    Bobby Portis (47.1%) &gt; 4.    Bryn Forbes (45.2%) &gt; 5.    Joe Ingles (45.1%)  pro tip for shooting 3s: have a 6 letter last name that ends in S
Also Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are massive upgrades over guys like Marvin Williams and Kyle Korver.
Bobby Portis alone have more points than Bam and Butler combined. [Is Bobby Portis better than Bam and Butler combined](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nbxqxe/simmons_and_embiid_combined_for_1647_40fg_bam)?

Keep my man Micic away from Bobby Portis Jr.!
Bucks are mental midgets. They do not play to their strengths whatsoever. The only one not playing like a moron is Bobby Portis.
"Why the fuck didn't the Knicks push for KD/Kyrie? Why? The had the cap space and they used it on Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Elfrid Payton, and Taj Gibson. I still don't get it."
Blake Griffin vs Bobby Portis is a fun little mini narrative
We just ran out a lineup of Jrue/Bryn Forbes/Pat Connaughton/Khris/Bobby Portis while both Kyrie and KD were still in the game
Bobby Portis with the early-mid 2000s fit
Brook Lopez was playing too well of course Bud had to take him out for trash Bobby Portis.
I need Bobby Portis to be my hero tonight
New York legend Bobby Portis and his merry band of Power Forwards.
"&gt; As for the Knicks, the goal was to create cap space to sign KD and Kyrie, but they got neither and used that cap space on Marcus Morris, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, Julius Randle, and Taj Gibson.  The return on this was just outstanding. Flipped Marcus Morris for Quickley + DSJ for D Rose, Regular-Season Randle, etc.."
"blake griffin at the 5.  bobby portis gets 18min and the team gets fucked. loses 1 in a best of 7.  ""this team is deep"""
Danny Green also worked with lethal shooter in the off season who has a track record of making guys elite shooters. He worked with randle and Bobby Portis as well who had career years
Bobby Portis is a fine rotation player...
Bobby Portis can actually deliver as a rotation guy.
Bobby Portis can do that for him
"i didn't watch too many bucks games this season but...  how are you gonna play giannis for 35m and then give bobby portis almost 18m?  forget the fact that the bucks did their best lakers round 1 impression from the 3pt line, but when you got blake griffin playing the 5, it seems like giannis should be feasting in the paint.  am i wrong here?"
As a Jazz fan I‚Äôm offended to see that people view this as the real finals while I have to watch fucking Jeff Teague and Bobby Portis
Brynn Forbes: 0-4  Pat C. : 0-0  Bobby Portis: 0-1  Middleton: 0-3  PJ Tucker: 1-4  Giannis: 1-4  Jrue Holiday: 2-6  Lopez: 0-1  This game should be a blowout.
Bobby Portis has played 10 minutes
How the fuck does Bobby Portis play almost as much as Brook Lopez in the first half of a playoff game?  Can the Bucks just fire Bud now?
He's been awful this game.  Please explain to me how Bobby Portis is this average rim protector.  Not good just average.  He rebounds and shoots threes.  But the Nets switch everything so his threes aren't gonna be wide open.  He's awful this series.  As shown by his plus minus and how bad the Bucks played with him on the court but keep rose tinted glasses on.
Again you know nothing if you think Bobby Portis offers bad rim protection.  He has been solid on defense for us this season shooting 40+Ÿ™ from three
"how lol, they let Bobby Portis elbow Blake like 3 times"
For this matchup he offers nothing defensively.  KD and Kyrie are not the guys you want to abuse Bobby Portis and his bad rim protection.  And yes I do know Bucks basketball.
Wtf Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis playing basketball looks like a bar room brawl
Bobby Portis messed up Mirotic
Soon as I saw Bobby Portis attempting a shot I laughed
"Jeff Teague I question, but you don't know bucks basketball if you think Bobby Portis is a bad player to be in."
Bud is messing around with these weird and stupid lineuos.  He could've been put his foot on the Nets throat but gotta have Bobby Portis and Jeff Teague play.
I don't think this is a Bobby Portis series
bobby portis is what charles barkley looked like when he played  just a big boy being faster and jumping higher than you would expect from such a large fella
"When Bobby Portis locks his gaze onto you, your soul is his."
I love me some Bobby Portis
Never forget the Bobby Portis game.
Best of luck Milwaukee (and former Knicks Bobby Portis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as well) :)
"Also, as far as I can tell the one with Bobby Portis, Khash and my new god Bryn Forbes on it is expected points for a series and I‚Äôd wager that most of the point totals were figuring closer to a 7 game series than a 4 game one."
"your team struggled all playoffs on offense. Especially with shooting. And Timmy is a shooter. But this goes back to my earlier point I've made in other threads; you guys didn't gather enough assets during your down times and now that you're trying to win you have barely any trade assets. you had 70M in cap space and you immediately spent it on taj gibson, bobby portis, etc. You could have used all that cap space to absorb contracts for first round picks. Then, with enough picks, you could have put in a competitive offer for Harden. How is is the nets had more trade assets then you guys did?  My theory is nba teams either need to be gathering mode getting trade assets (like squirrels gathering nuts for the winter) or spending mode getting talent to win it all. Teams that do one or another know who they are. Teams that do neither are in nba purgatory Hell. Let's see how you guys spend your cap space. Don't extent Randle to a max offer. Please."
Bobby Portis but no Giannis on this list is pretty funny
"I'm not giving up Bobby Portis for anything, hes ours."
Bobby portis is not a minimum level center fwiw
Will Cam Payne or Bobby Portis be the last Bull standing
You sure you want to give Giannis and Bobby Portis 5 flagrant 2 fouls each? I dont think the Nets would survive that
"What's the high risk?  You have a few years to contend. They got rid of liabilities and added solid perimeter defensive players and a playmaker that can bring the ball up the court in Jrue.   The only real ""risk"" that panned out was Bobby Portis stepping up, but if he didn't, you just stick in at the back of the bench.   I think they should be commended for how they've built around Giannis, but this is his best supporting cast by far. Not sure why that's ""high risk""."
"When I met Bobby Portis several years ago, the guy in front of me asked him to autograph ‚Äúcrazy eyes‚Äù after his name‚Ä¶..lol"
The Bobby Portis crazy eyes
"You don‚Äôt try a guy from Little Rock... especially with eyes like that. If Bobby Portis pissed me off, I would politely apologize to him for getting upset and run home."
He got Bobby Portis eyes
"to me it just looks like two dudes hat got into it and one eventually threw hands - from the sounds of it Miro *had* to have know it may have come to that yeah...they were jawing at each other and apparently Miro 'charged' at Bobby twice. Don't get me wrong, Bobby deserved to be punished but if i'm Miro, i know i'm probably doing shit that's entering into throwing hands territory lol Everything after is pretty muddy, Bobby tried to make amends but Miro wouldn't come to the table etc etc  lol tldr; shitty situation, tough to 'take sides' but overall, don't mess with Bobby Knuckles Portis!"
He‚Äôs had them Bobby ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to break my teammate‚Äôs jaw‚Äù-Portis type eyes
"Let's say there was a starting caliber player and on the court he does his job, but off the court Bobby Portis despises him. Could he tell the GM ""i don't fuckk with this guy"", then punch him square in the face and get him off the team? Do you think this has happened in the NBA?"
He scary with those Bobby Portis eyes
Bobby Portis‚Äô eyes
Bobby Portis was out and Forbes wasn't in his final form yet.
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
"&gt; it's extremely close to the same team.   Not really. Loss of important guys, age related decline, it‚Äôs a completely different team.  &gt; Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter.   He‚Äôs inconsistent. But the fact remains that he shot 43% from 3 against the Bucks.  &gt;He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically  He really didn‚Äôt. Man was cold during the Lakers series, averaging out his shooting vs the Bucks and Celtics.  &gt;I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them.   Not really. But even if they were, I‚Äôm not the front office so maybe try telling Riley that instead of me.  &gt;The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that  Exposed what exactly? That the 2021 Bucks were better than us? Because last I recall they added really good shooters on top of replacing negative Bledsoe with borderline all star Jrue Holiday. It‚Äôs not exactly the same team isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs not exactly the Heat lost due to these ‚Äúmarginal players‚Äù as much as the Bucks new additions were key for them. Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis shot over 46% from 3, and Holiday averaged a near triple double."
Bobby Portis?
"When the Heat upset the Bucks last post-season there were a few things:  - Bud couldn't adjust &amp; underplayed his stars  - Eric Bledsoe  - The Heat benefited immensely from the bubble: Duncan Robinson &amp; Herro were scorching hot and by Duncan Robinson's own admission, he benefited from not having to deal with the pressure of a crowd.  - Bucks were missing a true PG, bench scoring, and tough veterans. Jrue, PJ Tucker and Bobby Portis address that  And they've also improved their outside shooting.  As ridiculous as the Nets are offensively I'm not convinced their roster will be able to beat the Bucks over a 7 game series there's a lot of gaps."
"PG: Jalen Brunson  SG: D Rose  SF: Boucher  PF: Ingles  C: Bobby Portis   Bench: Rondo, Clarkson, Thad Young, and Gallo.   This team would be stacked lowkey üëÄ"
Bobby Portis  I‚Äôd saying he‚Äôs pretty good at looking
Yeah Bobby Portis is probably the best bet on who would do it. Dude says he envisions that the guy he is playing against just slapped his mom so he can get amped.
"Someone needs to chuck a beer at Bobby Portis to start Malice 2.0. Brooklyn fans won‚Äôt do it, but I could see the Sixers fans doing it. I could even see Giannis playing the Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal role."
"I don't really know anything about him, but Bobby Portis seems like the kinda guy that might do it. He's just got them crazy eyes."
Bobby Portis my dudes. How are you guys forgetting crazy eyes?
"I mean, how exactly did the Bucks win? They lost a 2nd round pick and had to spend the Bogi money on Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker. Who are both good, don't get me wrong... But I'm sure they'd still rather have Bogi and their 2022 2nd round pick."
Possibly but they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten Bobby Portis Peej Tucker and Bryn Forbes if they got Bogi
isn't thwt bobby portis
- Losing Bledsoe: addition by subtraction - Getting Jrue: major addition - Getting a sniper Bobby Portis: major bench addition - Forbes shooting that thang: major addition  And the Heat added 0 impact players and lost one of their best team defenders from last season. What did people expect?
"Bryn Forbes &gt;&gt; Kyle Korver (way past his prime)  Bobby Portis &gt;&gt; Robin Lopez (another rim protector that can shoot the 3)  Jrue Holiday &gt;&gt; Eric Bledsoe (need I say more?)  PJ Tucker &gt; Eran Illyasova (more defense, and more corner threes)  This bucks team is KILLING it with their depth."
Bobby Portis also. The toughness overall is miles ahead from the past two years
"Jeff Green against Giannis, Brook, Bobby Portis &amp; PJ Tucker  I dunno the front court for the Nets could be a legitimate problem."
You mean Bobby Portis?
"The Nets offered him a max contract after he had a really good shooting season, 51%FG% and 43% from 3, but even then he wasn‚Äôt worth it in the slightest. 1 year later he was traded for Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis who were both on expiring contracts, it was a strange trade for Chicago since Otto still had 3 years left on his contract"
Bobby portis
Bobby Portis is a good NBA player
"Plus, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes."
And a Bobby Portis. And a Bryn Forbes. And a PJ Tucker.
"&gt;a Jrue Holiday  also starring Bobby Portis  also starring Bryn Forbes,   executive producer much better coaching"
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm stupidly locked in‚Äù   \- Bobby Portis Jr.
bryn Forbes and bobby portis are the best shooters of all time
Bobby Portis is my favorite looking player in this series.  [He looks like the guy from this vid ](https://youtu.be/CKQDmQMqIwM?t=1)
Our future franchise player is afraid of Bobby Portis we are down bad my friends
Why is Bam so passive against Bobby fucking Portis? You‚Äôre supposed to be an all star and he‚Äôs giving you an open mid range shot WTF
Bobby Portis is just Naz Reid with anger management issues.
Bobby Portis is better than Randle üòπüòπ
If Bobby Portis looked me in the eyes I‚Äôd believe whatever he said
"It's clear you're ignorant af when it comes to anything basketball related if you think this isn't an automatic technical.  The reason I posted this is what someone else typed below  &gt;2 players have gotten called a technical for that in the last couple weeks lol. Come on. Lamelo rightfully got a T for doing the same thing like 2 weeks ago. Bobby Portis just got a T for doing this the other day. It‚Äôs a guaranteed tech. And the whole point of this thread, if you could follow it, is that CP3 thinks Foster is rigging the games or some shit, yet Foster blatantly skipped calling an easy tech on Paul. Why would Foster skip calling a super easy tech if he is somehow working against Paul?  Yet you think ""I'm looking for a reason to hate"". Just foh man."

I love Bobby Portis‚Äô stat lines. They‚Äôre always like 12 points and 7 boards in 15 minutes lol. Per 36 beast.
"Hell yeah, Bobby Portis"
The Bobby Portis game was one of the highlights from last season. Got mad love for him
"Hard to say whether he was or wasn't when Bobby Portis, PJ Tucker, and Forbes have all been very useful additions as well, and we're still in the 1st round.  Kinda just playing devil's advocate though, because for me Jrue is a fucking star."

"Bobby Portis is just a taller, stronger Trae Young"
Bobby ‚ÄúHulk‚Äù Portis
wtf I love Bobby Portis now
Bobby Portis took 20 shots in a  Conference Final game. This is not good for basketball.
"This is what happens when you give the team freedom of space that isn't warped around Giannis' offensive liability in terms of spacing.   No Giannis = Allows Lopez to cut, bang down low, and move freely. Gives the Bucks a much better bail out player who also is great at FT's (for a big) when they dive to the rim. Also gives drivers much more versatility cause bigs have to worry about an alley-oop or a dump off.   Giannis, as good as he is, doesn't command that kind of presence down low..  Really liked the ball movement from the Bucks last night and Brook is showing all the nephews that he's not some scrub big who shoots threes cause he wants to.   Glad Brook is getting his roses after this game cause the man can flat out score and just chose to be a 3PT specialist to elongate his career/better fit his team  ALSO allows Bobby Crazy Eyes Portis to spread the floor as a lethal 3PT shooter who loves to get rebounds. Spacing is important, hope this gives Bud an idea of how to manage minutes and lineups in the future if Giannis somehow returns"
Yeah I like seeing stuff like that. I just love Bobby Portis in general lmao. He seems like an awesome guy.
Yo why Bobby Portis lookin like Will Smith tryna play a NBA player?
"For a guy who mainly gets a rep for one incident and his ""crazy eyes"" he actually seems one of the friendliest on court in your typical plays. He plays the enforcer role but in normal plays he's not a douche  Pretty funny when he got shown that meme compilation of Bobby Portis puns and he found it funny"
Portis looks like the NBA version of scared straight. New rule: incoming rookies from G-League must spend 3 days shadowing Bobby Portis
Yessir Bobby BP Portis
I wouldn‚Äôt mess with Bobby Portis. Dude has them crazy eyes
I aint fucking around with Bobby Portis. He broke his own teammates nose...

&gt;	[Bobby Portis Jr points to his outstretched eyes with two fingers]
"Yeah, I'm coming around to thinking no team will give him anything close to a max. I get that Trae was out, but getting outplayed by both Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez in an important playoff game is unacceptable for somebody that wants the money he does."
Bobby Brook Portis-Lopez
Brook Lopez is Batman and Bobby Portis is Robin. Giannis and Middleton are frauds. Trade em.

My favorite Bobby moment tonight was when Huerter came behind him on a fast break and stripped him. Portis was so surprised and impressed with that play he gave Huerter a high five.
"Couple theories why he‚Äôs always been a fan favorite, his name is a good hooper name. Bobby Portis. Lmao The other theory is something similar to like Westbrook, he leaves it all out there. He doesn‚Äôt cheat the game"
Make no doubt about it that Bobby is looking to get paid‚Ä¶if the Bucks win a chip he is gone to the highest bidder. For context https://sports.yahoo.com/report-bobby-portis-rejected-bulls-174111115.html

"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Bobby Portis. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Bobby. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"Fuckin Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez, goddammit"
"Always loved Bobby Portis, hope he keeps it going."
"What are you talking about? This was absolutely without a doubt, one of the basketball games we've seen this playoffs.  Jokes aside, Trae Young is much more integral to Hawks' offense than Giannis is to the Bucks' and it showed. Not sure how the Hawks can bring this back. Even when Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis Jr aren't popping off, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are much more consistent scorings options than anyone on this Hawks team. I just don't see a good answer from the Hawks to the Bucks dominance in the paint either."
Unrelated but why does Bobby Portis low key look like a pigeon
"Score one for apocalypse bingo: Brook Lopez dominating the game and leading his team one game away from NBA Finals.   Seriously though, massive respect to Bucks front office for identifying players like Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis to acquire in the last couple off seasons that have become the X-Factors to them going beyond their previous heights even without Giannis."
Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez looked like prime AD and Boogie on the Pelicans

what? i know he's not as modern as portis but booz literally did 21/12/3 on 56%. of course he'd be better than bobby
"He'd be a small-ball 5 coming off the bench, not too unlike a Bobby Portis. Don't know if he would be as good as Portis though."
"I'm still on the fence. Love Giannis and old man Bobby Portis, but I also love watching CP3 and Ayton play when they are on fire."
"They‚Äôll use the Bucks team as reference lol.   ‚ÄúYou already have your Middleton (CJ) and Jrue (Nurk), so please trust us while we find your Bobby Portis‚Äù"
"Lopez is a bit underrated imo.  For all the people here saying Portis should get his minutes, Portis is targeted even harder by CP3 when he is on the floor and not doing much better in any sense.  Lopez has a much better defensive IQ which is to be expected given the experience gap between him and bobby buckets, and Lopez is a very effective rim protector.  All that being said I love bobby portis.  You can say that traditional slower big rim protector role is moot in the playoffs given the last couple of match-ups but you can find numerous interviews, particularly Duncan Robinson, talking about how much of a difference Lopez was in the Heat series. Against certain matchups he is too slow and exploitable but there are other teams that he makes a tremendous impact by denying the rim as well as anybody.  If the Hawks had somebody like Lopez that could have been tremendous for them, it really depends on matchups.  Bud needs to be smart about when he uses Brook which interestingly enough he has been most of the playoffs.  Having an elite rim protector that can also threaten from deep with a couple of post moves in his pocket is not anywhere near the liability in the playoffs as everyone here suggests."
Also some fans were mad in our first 3 playoff series because he got equal or even more minutes than Bobby Portis
I agree Bobby Portis is cold
Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis were top 10 during the regular season
Too bad Monty wasn't there to hype him up with a speech before the Bobby Portis fight lol
The suns don't have a real backup 5 and they're playing Jae Crowder at 4 against Giannis and Bobby Portis. The bucks have Brook Lopez at the 5 who's still very good. Cam Johnson has played well in some minutes but he's a second year player and clearly extremely overmatched when he's played against Giannis. There's no way the bucks wouldn't dominate the boards with the way the teams lineups are.
"Then Middleton looked at Giannis in the eyes like he was the only other person in the room. He proceeded to pick Giannis up and carry him to the Bucks locker room and layed him down hot dog style on one of the benches. Giannis layed there with his limbs dangling. Middleton stood over him powerfully for what felt like a lifetime. Bobby Portis exlaimed, ""Omg not this again!"". Thelo na me nioseis  by Nikos Vertis began playing in the background. Coach bud posted up in a nearby corner smoking a jazz cigarette, never once looking away. Then and there something beautiful happened and I don't have the words to describe it. They should have sent a poet. Pat Connaughton watched as well, trapped inside his locker, frozen by a mixture of curiosity and fear. He wondered if this is what they meant when they said ""Fear the Deer""."
"(Live in Kentucky, love nba basketball but never had a local team to root for)  Definitely Bucks. Giannis is just a good guy that plays the game on a extremely watchable way (tries to dunk the soul out of everyone). Middleton is that quiet kid in middle school everyone made fun of but has had an insane redemption arc. Bobby Portis is an s-tier hype man  Suns on the other hand worship at the altar of flops and bullshit. Jae crowder is approaching pat bev level of annoying. Chris Paul is dirty. Booker is a great scorer but is learning a little too much negativity from Chris Paul. Add in the fact that the refs seem like they‚Äôre trying to hand the series to the suns and it‚Äôs a wrap"
"I thought aside from Jrue (who's literally the best guard defender in the league), Giannis was our best defender on Book and CP3, his length was obviouslt affecting them, and when we an him at the 5, CP3 was scared of even attacking him, and when he did the results are bad.   There's not many big men who CP3 actively avoids switching onto lol. Giannis is one of them, it was hilarious in the game to see CP3 run a PnR to get Giannis siwtched onto him, onto to think ""oh shit, it's Giannis!"", and then he runs yet another pnr to get Bobby Portis guarding him"
I would have thought Bobby Portis would get poked in the eye more.
"Suns fans will say Suns, Bucks fans will say Bucks. The Booker non called sixth foul will be the headliner but the list is extremely long for the Suns as well.  Including missed kicked ball by Jrue in first quarter for a basket, Aytons questionable fouls in the first half, off PJs foot called Bucks ball, Devin Bookers soft 5th foul which led to him sitting for 5 minutes, the off Bobby Portis hands off the jump called Bucks ball.  Refs were bad. Suns still should have won had they not turned it over a million times."
I saw Bobby Portis and several Bulls players at the time at Panda Express a few years ago.
"I have Bobby Portis' brother added on Snapchat and he views my stories sometimes  Edit: oh and Spencer Dinwiddie replied ""lol"" to my meme when he was on the Bulls"
Bobby Portis is cool now though
Shoutout to Bobby Portis man‚Ä¶ He just stepped in and balls.
They‚Äôd be better off starting Bobby Portis. His intensity and effort on the boards with a respectable enough shot can play a similar role more effectively. He‚Äôs a little more agile on defense as well. Brook just Bombs 30 foot threes off pick and pops it sometimes kills their offensive rhythm and flow. He can‚Äôt defend anyone so his production gets matched easily.
"I mean, Bobby Portis once punched his teammate in the face and hospitalized him. But otherwise, agreed"
"And the books are one of the most likable teams imo. Giannis is great, jrue seems like a really good guy, and bobby portis is crazy but lovable."
"Definitely should have fouled out there, but sounds like it was a makeup call for either the ball going out on PJ Tucker before Book's 5th foul or for the ball going off of Bobby Portis from the jumpball.  After all the missed calls I'm okay with this because it benefits my team. Still hate the idea of make up calls."
Can you introduce you to the goat Bobby Portis?
ya but it has bobby portis
im not sure there is a player i a have larger irrational hatred for than bobby portis.
I needed Bobby portis to shoot that 3 lol
That was off Bobby Portis
bobby portis is the guy outside wendys that asks you for change and then calls you out when you say you don't have any
Gotta love seeing Bulls academy graduates Cam Payne &amp; Bobby Portis getting burn down the stretch in a finals game
We all agree Bobby Portis has definitely killed someone at some point?
Bobby Portis looks like if Carlton was actually good at basketball
Bobby Portis should be getting PJ Tuckers minutes
Booker and cp3  shot like 7-7 with holiday on them that quarter. Cp3 was 0-2 with Bobby Portis on him lmao
"I'mma write a parody of ""Bette Davis Eyes"" called ""Bobby Portis Eyes."" To wit:  Well he can shoot from deep  Don't take him many tries  On him you cannot sleep  He's got Bobby Portis eyes  Got the defender on you  He don't have to look twice  His three-pointer falls  He's got Bobby Portis eyes  .....if you can help me with more lyrics, I'm all ears!"
"Someone should write a parody of ""Bette Davis Eyes"" called ""Bobby Portis Eyes"""
Bobby Portis.
Bobby Portis is Candyman
Bobby Portis got those Omar Epps/Mike Tomlison eyes
Bobby Portis could be the Manningface of the NBA
bobby portis looks like a muppet scientist.  tell me I'm wrong.
On a fast break and you have Giannis on one side and Bobby Portis on the other. Wwyd?
Here's Bobby Portis.. he once punched his teammate in the face
You‚Äôre literally the only one. This sub loves Bobby Portis
*NBA Finals fan favorite Bobby Portis*  What a world.
Im cheering for the bucks but why does Bobby Portis' existence make me so mad lmao
Bobby Portis' fan support rating is legit 110% rn lol
Bobby Portis got a funny ass face
Whatever happened to that European guy Bobby Portis got into a fight with on the Bulls?
Bobby ‚Äúgoat eyes‚Äù portis
Bobby Portis is a national treasure and should be protected at all costs
Root for us because we have Bobby Portis  Nuff said
"If the bucks win it‚Äôs because the man of the match is Giannis. I don‚Äôt see the suns losing because of Bobby Portis, no matter how loud they chant his name"
Bobby portis sits on towls to stop ass sweat from coming through.
"&gt; it hinders our ability to actually dominate on the international stage  What's hindering them is the team missing like 6 of its top-10 players. If they had Lebron, Curry, Harden, AD, Klay and Bobby Portis it wouldn't have really mattered if the refs called it on Space Jam rules."
"Portis is a hustle guy. All you need to do is out-hustle him - boxout, grab the boards, and he'll be taken out after 2 min of play. In GM3 Suns came out soft and failed to compete. Bobby is the least of Monty's worries."
"&gt;more like hey we tried to sign all these guys who actually don't really work for the modern NBA.  What a stupid fucking thing to say lol, Marcus Morris is a legit piece for the Clippers, Bobby Portis is a legit piece for the Bucks, Taj Gibson is a solid backup 5 for a playoff team, Randle is an All NBA player, which one of those guys don't work in the modern nba?"
"Tonight on Nathan For You, the plan: introduce Bobby Portis to the group Portishead and convince him that he is currently in a fugue state and that in the 90s he was in a successful band that was named after him. I gathered up some of the former members, along with a hypnotist to both lull him into a state of complete ease while showing him the music he once created with the hope that he will quit basketball and again return to the recording studio."
"&gt; The biggest thing with me this year is that I‚Äôm at peace with myself finally. I finally found myself in my career. The journey is what I appreciate the most about the NBA, man.  Nah, that man is free now. Ain't no prisoner no more. Quote is from the other Bobby Portis thread."
Bobby Portis got ‚ÄúManson lamps‚Äù lol‚Ä¶..
"They aren't exactly great help defenders for sure, but the main reason Giannis is eating is the constant mismatches he's getting. He's putting Booker/Briges/Crowder/Johnson, and yes, sometimes even Frank, in the weight room. He's also eating on the offensive glass with Bobby Portis, and he's making his fts!"
"WAIT, Bobby portis not 36?"
And his name is Bobby Portis that‚Äôs like the perfect name for a journeyman player from the 70s.
"At least one mad replier saw the full game where the announcers even called it out but the only vid is the bobby Portis clip where he made a great play and rebounded and got fouled. The crowd was going nuts, bobby was hyped and Giannis was seen pouting and yelling at Middleton. Then he continues to the bench and while Portis is shooting, Giannis is seen yelling at his team to get him the ball.  The announcers laugh and say, ""Giannis telling them to give him the ball. All while everyone is chanting ""bobby, bobby"". Then they drew a play specifically for Giannis a few plays later."
Someone on Twitter described Bobby Portis as how an Hollywood actor looks playing a basketball player and that's all I can see now.
As soon as Bobby Portis joined the bucks his three point shot has ascended
"12/15/17 Bulls at Bucks, went with my dad. Saw bobby portis get his at then career high, star wars themed night too"
"These journalists are piss poor and totally trying to build a narrative for some crappy story they want to publish.   I'm sure he was hoping for a quote like ""I'll be telling my kids blah blah blah"", and the reporter who wants to put together a puff piece will frame it like ""Giannis is a generational talent. Teammates like Bobby Portis marvel at his athleticism, [insert quote here]""  It's totally lazy journalism."
Bobby Portis seems very likeable guy to hang out with and have a coffee to go.
"Bobby Portis ""it's ya boy!!!"""
"While being pissed during a moment where the team was playing well TOGETHER and trying to get hyped and keep a run going. Everyone, especially on here, was talking shit about his teammates doing nothing this series. And especially the bucks fans. Don't you think that was a terrible moment for him to get mad at the team and demand the ball lol? it's something that happened that confirms that he was pissed he wasn't getting the ball more and proves my point that they won't be able to ""play random"" like coach bud said and just flow and try to find the open man more.  After Bobby Portis great play that just happened randomly lol."
"I don‚Äôt think anyone has the competitive drive that Mike had, save for Bobby Portis"
"\[Charania\] Bobby Portis on joining    Bucks: ""I actually hit Giannis and told him come and get me.    It made me day""."
"Agreed, that one play last night when Teague jumped away from Bobby Portis to throw in the entry pass made me shake my head so hard."
Bobby Portis has the crazy eyes. Every team needs somebody like that because you know if shit has to go down he's on their side.
Yeah but Bobby Portis is winning FMVP so that‚Äôs not happening sorry
"My nickname for Bobby Portis is ""Hateful"" because of that one time he punched Nikola Mirotic for no reason"
Do not leave out bobby Portis. That is slander. He was magical during the game.
"Bulls fan here, I was paying decently close attention to that incident, and pretty quickly a lot of the signs pointed to Mirotic being more of the instigator. There were reports of Mirotic charging at him repeatedly or something, and the fact that they traded Mirotic that season instead of Portis would be weird if Bobby was the problem.  I don‚Äôt know if we ever got the complete story and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not totally blameless, but I think most Bulls fans continued to have a positive opinion of him through all that drama."
"It's dishonest to say it's going to negatively impact the team, when the team played amazing basketball last night. You're taking this microcosm of an interaction and blowing it WAY out of proportion.   And look, the announcers are paid to talk about basketball, so maybe they deserve some credence in their opinion on the game, but they're just regular guys like me and you. They are not basketball gods that understand every intention and interaction that ever happens on a basketball court. Especially not the ESPN guys. So just because an announcer talks about a player interaction doesn't mean that they are privy to information that we aren't.   It's hard to believe that you and I watched the same game last night and your thoughts on it are ""Damn, Giannis wtf are you doing?"" Rather than ""He had a good game."" You're really stretching to be a contrarian. Very easy for some people to hate on these guys for literally the tiniest detail that most other fans (and probably the players themselves) have already forgot about.   And if you want to talk about the Bobby Portis play then fine. Giannis sucked the wind out of exactly zero sails. The crowd was Hype. Portis was hype. The team was playing well and they were up by like twenty or something. If all it takes for a player to have the wind taken out of their sails was Giannis saying ""Pass the ball"" then they wouldn't be in the NBA.   You're argument is moot on nearly all angles. Unless you just hate Giannis, which by all means do so, but you shouldn't sit on this high horse like you're taking the other players feelings into account."
Same. I am bobby portis age range and dude looks like he could be my dad
I surprised Giannis didn‚Äôt respond with ‚Äúwho the fuck is Bobby Portis?‚Äù
"This bucket can be given an (not statistic) assist to Bobby Portis. His cut caused Craig to get out of the lane, then the threat of his rebounding caused Craig not to fully grab the board.  Portis‚Äô teammate grade went up."
I'm pretty sure the NBA Finals exposed how bad flopping has got in the NBA to the masses. Devin Booker and Chris Paul were insufferable with it! Booker has now surpassed CP3 in the flop department. Bobby Portis set a pick after the play was over to stop Booker from getting to the refs to bitch some more.
Bobby Portis
Love Giannis. Can‚Äôt believe we gave Bobby Portis a ring though.
He deserves it just like PJ and Bobby Portis. Guys paid their dues and accepted their roles
"I think a lot of these players are being taken advantage of. Some of these mega stars soak up max contracts and leave scraps to build a team around.   You never see LeBron settling for less. Its come here sign for league minimum and maybe win a championship. Harden made an average of $42m a year, PJ signed a 4 year $31m contract. Its always the role players that take the hit and make the sacrifice. That's the disrespect.  PJ is going to have to make another decision to play at a discount again because the Bucks don't have any money. Same with Bobby Portis a guy that can probably get a $40m - $50m deal with another team."
He possibly saved the whole finals by breaking up the Bobby Portis and CP3 fight. All time play by him there
"Why are you resorting to just base insult level arguments? PJ is a role player plain and simple and should be paid like one, as much as I love the guy  KD averaged 34/9/4 on 50/40/87, as much as PJ gave huge effort, you can‚Äôt use that as an argument  You‚Äôre basically saying because PJ played minutes on a title team that we disrespected him by not overpaying him? Come on man I don‚Äôt know what team you‚Äôre a fan of (flair up) but be reasonable. By that logic Bobby Portis should be making 15 mil a year too"
"He was great during the regular season and amazing in the Heat series but couldn't do anything after that. In the Brooklyn series when the defense started clamping down on him, he was too small to even get his shot off it seemed like.   Still he was a part of Bucks history and I'll forever be grateful for his time here. Go get the money!   When Bobby Portis declines his player option, that one will for sure sting a little more."
Bobby Portis is forever a scumbag for that
NBA champion Bobby Portis
When‚Äôs the Bobby Portis time stamp?
"Most people can shoot at a serviceable level. Not many shoot at the level Duncan Robinson shoots at. While he may lose some impact when he‚Äôs off, he‚Äôs still providing insane spacing that helps others a ton. Bobby Portis has less impact if he‚Äôs off than Duncan would on an off night. People can leave Bobby open if he‚Äôs cold, you can‚Äôt leave Duncan open even if he‚Äôs 1/9 because one make can get him going."
"Nah man, just about the whole league can shoot these days.  If you can shoot &gt;35% from 3pt and have a well-rounded game then I'd argue that's more valuable than being an assassin from 3pt.  Reason being that while 3pt assassins can get hot and win you games outright, they can also go cold and disappear.  At risk of sounding like a prisoner of the moment, I'd rather have Bobby Portis in my rotation than Duncan Robinson."
"this sub is so dumb sometimes  bobby portis did this in the finals, and yall love him, but when booker does it hes an asshole?"
"Bobby Portis, the eyes don't lie"
"If you're upset about his complaining, then I have bad news about two guys on your team by the names of PJ Tucker and Bobby Portis who complain frequently to the refs as well."
Bobby Portis
Who else were you thinking of that had better freshman seasons? I‚Äôm not an Arkansas fan so people will probably slip my mind but Bobby Portis is all I can think of
Did you watch the NBA Finals ? I remember Bobby Portis doing this multiple times.
Bobby Portis
"&gt;Bobby Portis also took less to sign with the Bucks this season  Who else offered Portis a contract?  The Knicks declined the 2nd year of his contract at $15M, just wasn't sure what other offers were out there for him."
Joakim Noah and Bobby Portis are the 2 guys that whenever I see them I‚Äôm like damn you really look like that
Bobby Portis v Mirotic would be lit!
Bobby portis ain't demar. Demar has been so efficient
Bobby Portis also took less to sign with the Bucks this season. It's not unreasonable to think someone would do a 1 year deal or a deal with a player option at the end to make a run at a ring this next year.
"No youve got a ""anyone can type 'Bobby Portis punch' into a search engine to get a fairly accurate account of what happened"" type."
"Bobby ""Boucher"" Portis"
Every year the media picks a random role player to dick ride. It's Bobby Portis' year.
Bobby Portis go hard as f
Fuck. No more Bobby Portis hate from me.
It‚Äôs made up. It‚Äôs okay to wake up one day and face reality. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself turtle üê¢  Very fitting tho. Tortoise taking the Bobby Portis Franklin lookalike‚Äôs side

I love Bobby Portis. Dude seems like he would be loyal for life.
By all account mirotic charged at Portis and bobby was just defending himself
Didn‚Äôt Bobby Portis say he envisions the other team slapping his mom to get himself amped up for game? That‚Äôs honestly fucking sad after hearing this.  [I was right that‚Äôs really sad](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/before-games-bobby-portis-pictures-opponents-slapping-his-mom/)
"I saw Bobby Portis at a grocery store in Milwaukee a few weeks back. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

The Bobby Portis Game 6 tech may have just saved the Bucks from the reality of teams overpaying for him lol

"r/nba siding with famous hard workers RJ Hunter, Jerian Grant, Denzel Valentine and Bobby Portis over Jimmy Butler and an undersized wing who had a top 20 career ever on half a knee."
Im convimced thats what Bobby Portis does
"These answers are all great, and I'd love to see a team which is only made up of these players. Dort, JTA, Bobby Portis, Thybulle, etc... It wouldn't be very good, but damn it would have a ton of heart and energy!"
"I love the ""Off the bench energy guys""  so much. Specifically, over the course of this season, JTA and Bobby Portis have become some of my favourite players in the league, I just absolutely love them. Both have rough backgrounds and are humble and lovable, and clearly love their job. Fan favourites instantly.   The Bobby Portis blocking CP3 and the run he did looking like an anime character is something I wont forget for a minute, it was so hilarious.  The JTA dive to save the ball and pass it to Steph for him to take the deep 3 INSTANTLY and drill it in during clutch time of a close game is something I also won't forget for awhile. Even though we lost, that Celtics/Warriors game was the best reg season game of the season."
Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis he just got that energy
"Everyone knows now, but Bobby ""Crazy Eyes"" Portis."
"Who cares? Wade was a legend, playing journeyman on terrible teams like the Bulls at the tail end of his career. Whatever he was up to is so insignificant at that point, I don't think it's worth slandering him for. Especially for the sake of promoting the merits of Bobby Barely-Plays Portis"

"That's a weird story but it's not violent?  That's a very weird piece of ""evidence.""  I'm simply saying we don't know *nearly* enough about these people to say one way or another as confidently as you are, and also Bobby Portis has done enough dirty stuff in the NBA that makes me question if he really is as wholesome as you think."
"Theo pinson, Frank Ntilikina, Bobby Portis still"
"&gt;The fact they got rid of Mirotic instead of Bobby speaks volumes.  I don't really think that's how it works.  Getting rid of Mirotic wasn't about siding with either player in that argument.  I don't even think they care.  The organization is just about figuring out how to win and save money.  The Bulls were trying to tank and Mirotic was a good player.  Portis was younger and fit better with a tanking roster that was still a few seasons away from contending.    &amp;#x200B;  This is an article that describes what they were doing.    &gt;Without Mirotic to start the season, the Bulls were on a fantastic tanking pace, winning only three of their first 23 games. As soon as Mirotic returned to the lineup and began hitting 3s like they were layups, the Bulls won 15 of their next 28 games, including seven straight when Mirotic came back. Chicago is 18‚Äì33, sitting just outside the bottom five in the standings. But there‚Äôs no doubt that getting rid of Mirotic helps it climb (or stumble) in the Down for Doncic Sweepstakes.

Bobby Portis always seems like he's two sentences away from putting hands on someone.  Sounds like wade needed to get checked.
"https://www.sportscasting.com/nba-finals-hero-bobby-portis-once-punched-teammate-face-practice-sent-to-hospital/  &gt;To a man, Portis punching a teammate was wrong. There‚Äôs not one Bulls player disputing that. But there continues to be a lingering sense that Mirotic came into training camp with a feeling of entitlement, and that was not sitting well with many of his younger teammates.  &gt;Mirotic and Portis had some history, so when Mirotic made an aggressive move toward him, Portis, 22, obviously had enough."
"https://www.sportscasting.com/nba-finals-hero-bobby-portis-once-punched-teammate-face-practice-sent-to-hospital/  The initial reports called it a suckered punch, but players later came out(mostly off the record) saying that it was on Mirotic but Bobby still shouldn't have done it.  The fact they got rid of Mirotic instead of Bobby speaks volumes. Especially because at the time Mirotic was seen as a solid player."
"wade never had to work for anything so when he got to Chicago he probably didn't know how to. 2006 was handed to him on a silver platter by the refs and LeBron carried his bum ass to titles in 2012 and 2013.    It's like an entitled child getting his first ""real job"" and having to work on his own without training wheels. He thought he was Kobe, miami knew he wasn't so they refused to pay him. He left like an infant running away from home. Found out actually working for things is difficult and called his daddy to bail him out and pick him up from work because the other kids were mean to him. LeBron didn't want to leave the stray dog out to die so he let him sleep in the garage in Cleveland but his started pissing and shitting everywhere so he traded the bum for a protected second round pick.    Bobby Portis jerseys would be top sellers if he broke wade's face in practice."

They kind of already did have guys taking paycuts to join them. Bobby Portis said he took a discount to go to Milwaukee. Bryn Forbes probably could've signed for more than a minimum somewhere.
"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get like a huge buyout guy or anything, but it might make some other players who want to redeem their value like Bobby Portis look at us, or guys who might not be the ‚Äúright‚Äù guy for a team like Brooklyn.  I can see us going after Patty Mills with the Bud connection.  Oladipo worked out with Giannis last year and needs a place to try and rebuild his value.  There will be other guys who aren‚Äôt big names who might get a boost from playing next to Giannis.  We aren‚Äôt going to get another All-Star or anything, but it‚Äôll make us much more attractive to role players looking to up their value."
Lowkey what can Javale do that Bobby Portis can't. We shoulda sent Bobby
Bobby Portis is Franky?
Bobby Portis is 26
"No, Bogut's injury is. If Bucks lost game 6 and 7, I certainly wouldn't be whining about Bobby Portis missing his 15 minutes"
That was pretty much Bobby Portis who will probably leave for a bigger paycheck now
Bobby Portis is only 26. I thought of him as like a 30+ year old veteran locker room presence kind of guy lol.
Bobby Portis is 26‚Ä¶
"Bobby Portis, game 7 against the Suns lol"
They are locked in this was basically their core there's not much to really do other than small moves for role players on the margins. Do they even have their full MLE not sure. The thing they could use a creative offensive player/playmaker doesnt come cheap either. Patty Mills if he ever actually leaves San Antonio might be a good name  One thing I would not do is overpay to bring back PJ Tucker or Bobby Portis.
"Slightly less than bobby portis, sorry."
"Middleton got drafted by Detroit, played his rookie season there before getting traded to MIL.   Holiday was traded last year.   Pat Connaughton, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis was a free agent signing."
Didn't even mention Bobby Portis. Smh.
"The Morris brothers have already been (involved in? accused of?) a pretty nasty assault.  Jusuf Nurkic is huge and from Bosnia and has a temper.  I absolutely wouldn't fuck with Crazy Eyes Bobby Portis, though, that's for sure."
Re-sign Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis any day.
"You are very wrong, they got a MVP Superstar in Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are All-Stars level players, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker are excellent role players. Align with that Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes who are decent role players.  It is very difficult to make a team as deep as that. Most of the teams that have 1 or more superstars, don\`t have a bench as good and tall as Milwaukee.  And they got lucky their biggest opponent is this playoff, who was Brooklyn, 2 of their 3 best players got injured..."
Those are some Bobby Portis eyes on him
Neither am I but it‚Äôs plausible! Bobby portis came in though and this was before having a ring under the belt.
Problem is I'm from  Arkansas :(. That's also why I'm a Bobby Portis simp
Depends on 'young' but there's a few others:  * Bobby Portis (26) might not have played inn the Brooklyn series but was huge when Giannis went down and proved his worth in the conference finals and finals.  * Onyeka Okongwu (20) showcased some really strong defense against Giannis  * Basically the entire Atlanta Hawks team  * Terance Mann (24)  * Dillon Brooks (25)   I've probably missed some but those are the ones that stood out to me
"If this is how it goes down then there isn‚Äôt a three for 50 type deal that takes Bobby out of Milwaukee. That leaves the MLE for other teams against Milwaukee offering him the TPMLE with a PO in year two he can exercise and then get the max early bird four year deal.   However, Spurs could go Portis over Lauri, Charlotte or Toronto could view him as a center and just abandon rim protection, Miami could strike out on Lowry and want to start him next to Bam. I hope I‚Äôm wrong on all these accounts"
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
Imagine what Game of Zones would do with Bobby Portis
He doesn't do anything for the Bucks that Bobby Portis doesn't do better at this point in their respective careers.
"Everyone‚Äôs looking at the fair market value and saying this is wrong, which for most cases is true, but the model still identifies some of the bargains in the market. Sure, Kemba isn‚Äôt worth 26/yr but you cant say 8m/yr isn‚Äôt good value. Bobby Portis and Patty Mills were also good bargains.   A name missing I thought was good value is Cam Payne"
older than Bobby Portis
The disrespect to Bobby Portis.
Or Giannis and Portis - wait Bobby hasn't gotten his yet
Yea youre right. Bobby Portis is an all star.
Bobby Portis at $21M per destroys the credibility of this AI.
&gt;Bobby Portis - contract $4.5M/yr - **fair market value ~$21M/yr** - difference ~$16M/yr  Lmfao what in the fuck?
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
Bobby Portis literally just took a pay cut to stay in Milwaukee
Maybe wants try the Bobby Portis strategy.
"If Bobby Portis was allowed to participate in any sort of combat with no limits, as god as my witness, he would literally force any opponent to spontaneously combust through his merciless might. It‚Äôs only because of his immense restraint that he doesn‚Äôt abhorrently decimate the entire NBA. It seems the world‚Äôs most dangerous man can only be contained in one domain‚Ä¶ Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
Bobby portis &gt;:
"You guys have had discounts before. Bobby Portis just signed for a deal, you got Wes Matthews on a minimum two years ago, and you guys were at the front of the line in the buyout market for Marvin Williams (who was probably the best buyout guy available) about 18 months ago.  But at the same time the Bucks don't have the brand of going all in the way the Lakers and Heat and some other teams do. You did when you thought you might lose Giannis, but now that he's locked up, what happened to bringing back PJ Tucker? Who are you going to use your MLE on? Will you guys even use it at all? That's very much in doubt."
East still has Bobby ‚ÄúNBA Champion Bobby Portis‚Äù Portis

"I dunno didnt bobby portis sign for cheaper in milwaukee than he coulda got in like brooklyn? Its all situational and its not like if okc was all loaded up w max contracts with stars who could win a ring they wouldnt get guys on cheap contracts too. Although he wasnt amazing or anything, caron butler signed with yall for pennies in between 2 bigger contracts in 2013 when you were competing for a chip."
"Bobby Portis is the most similar recent example I can think of. Drafted in the 1st round in 2015, signed with the Bucks for $3.6 million in 2020. Monk was drafted in the 1st round in 2017, just signed with the Lakers for what I assume is even less than that."
I would say Bobby Portis but that man is a sociopath
High - Bobby Portis  Low - Letting Tucker leave
"There'll be some other ones I don't know, but Bobby Portis:  * 2019-20 NYK - .358 on 2.8 attempts * 2020-21 MIL - .471 on 2.4 attempts"
"Drummond took the min to back up Embiid.  Wow.  Also, Maurice Harkless got the exact same contract as Bobby Portis.  Man that contract is great for MIlwaukee."
"Bobby Portis, Crazy Eyes Bobby"
"-	KD, Slim Reaper -	LeBron, The Phenom -	Giannis, The Gyro Step or Super Gyro -	Bobby Portis, The Eater of Worlds -	Harden, The Soho Hobo -	Kyrie, Captain Bizarro -	Alex Caruso, The Ranger -	Steph Curry, The Spicy One -	Klay Thompson, Mr. Chocolate Milk -	Lowry and Jimmy, The Butt and The Butler  Some are purposely goofy, just trying to have some fun"
"He also looked way worse on defense vs the Nets compared to the Bucks and Raptors. He didn't suddenly become worse as the stats imply, guarding Kyle Lowry or Brogdon/George Hill is different from guarding James Harden and Kevin Durant. Bobby Portis didn't suddenly become a better defender vs Atlanta and Phoenix, the matchup changed. Stats without context don't tell the whole story, the eye test without context doesn't tell the whole story either."
Yeah if the nets are coming off a championship win he can get a Bobby Portis contract! Wait..
"Yea I think you could make the argument either way depending on what the team needs. I just can‚Äôt believe people think this is an overpay. Seems like a really fair deal to me for a solid 3&amp;D guy. There were a few steals this year like the Cam Payne and Bobby Portis deals, but Bullock‚Äôs deal is pretty in line with what similar role players got."
It's a reference to an interview from his Arkansas days where he said he hypes himself up by imagining the opposing teams players slapping his mom lmao  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/before-games-bobby-portis-pictures-opponents-slapping-his-mom/
Or Bobby Portis
It's a great deal for the Bucks who keep Bobby Portis at a reduced price. The latter must have wanted to defend his NBA championship.
"If the Bogdan trade went though  We Lose DiVincenzo, Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker.  Good chance Nets win the Title if that trade goes though."
That literally worked for Bucks and Bobby Portis. If the kid really wanted to stay he would have worked something out. He got paid a Kings Ransom I don't see how the Lakers could match with their top heavy payroll.
There's some talented players getting that kind of money. Ask Bobby Portis.
Millsap to buck to form up a super team with bobby portis and semi ojeleye
Bucks. Bobby Portis&gt;any amount of players a team can sign
Lol Bobby Portis had to be stopped from yelling ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play here for free man‚Ä¶Ill play for free.‚Äù From his agents.
Bobby Portis got robbed.
WWE Hall of Famer Bobby Portis
Thats Bobby Portis not Luca
"Bobby fuckin Portis is underpaid, but he's just rad like that."
"Our team store has been selling a bunch of shirts with Bobby's face on them (I may or may not have bought one), so It wouldn't surprise me if merch related to him is pretty high up there for the Bucks.  https://shop.bucks.com/collections/mens-bucks-t-shirts/products/item-of-the-game-bobby-bobby-portis-milwaukee-bucks-t-shirt"
"All these free agents are getting way over payed, then Bobby Portis the one who proved himself in the FINALS gets lowballed. Wtf man"
Key Championship contributor Bobby Portis def deserves more. I expect that the Bucks have a handshake deal to offer him more next year.
Bobby Portis is being grossly underpaid
Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis got his ring and Giannis signed a big ass contract. He aint leaving lol.
"It's not what he brings scoring wise, it's his defense and what he brings to a locker room. The mental toughness he brought to our group is invaluable. Rather have Portis stay at this point cause Bobby is in his prime and PJ nearing the end but I'll miss PJ."
Bobby Portis. Which is the opposite of how I thought it was going to go with these two.
apparently giannis and bobby portis wouldn‚Äôt
I need this in Bobby Portis.
ask bobby portis
"There's a lot to be said about culture, chemistry, and coaching. Big market teams don't understand this shit and then act surprised when things like this happens. I love this for the Suns and i fully understand why he would want to run it back. When you already have millions, sometimes it's not worth more to leave a wonderful situation.  The same people are surprised with Bobby Portis staying too... they just can't think outside the small box they put players in.  Good luck Suns bro, hope to see y'all in the finals again"
Not until people stop acting like Bobby Portis is a superstar
NBA CHAMPION BOBBY PORTIS!
"Money is nice, but Bobby Portis gets to feel like a superstar in Milwaukee and thats gotta be a good geeling."
"Oh fuck. Everybody thought he was gonna go get the bag when he opted out  That's way unexpected  The headline should have said ""Former Buck Bobby Portis"" just to fuck with people"
The people need a erect a Bobby Portis statue in downtown Milwaukee tonight.
"Also, breaking news‚Ä¶  Bobby Portis and his agent are not smart."
Bobby Portis could start a cult and probably get no fewer than 75% of Bucks fans to join no questions asked.
Bobby Portis really had a chance to cash in and settled for this ... ?
Damn Bobby Portis doing the bucks a solid all around.
"Portis rewarding those ""bobby"" chants from the post season"
Bobby Portis better be getting free drinks in Milwaukee for the rest of his life.
"Buck fans 2 days ago: ‚Äúwe love you Bobby, fly away and soar my pretty bird‚Äù  Portis today: ‚Äúyooooooo what up SKANKS‚Äù"

"If Bobby Portis didn‚Äôt show any mercy, he‚Äôd destroy every single player in half a millisecond. That‚Äôs how dominant and earth-crumbling he can be. God help us all if he loses his angelic restraint."
lmao heat fans went from thinking they were gonna steal giannis to getting turned down by bobby portis for less money  bucks in 6 baby ü§ü
WOW more than Bobby Portis?!?
"That‚Äôs future back-to-back NBA Champion, Bobby Portis*"
We likely don‚Äôt sign Bobby portis with bogie on books.
Bobby Portis maybe.
Just enough to get Bobby Portis
The only reason why Bobby Portis doesn‚Äôt literally destroy his completion is because he simply chooses not to.
He goes by NBA Champion Bobby Portis now btw
"Young Aussie teammate to mentor at the end of his career, more European play style with Luka, might get more Olympic Patty. Him and Bobby Portis, re-sign THJ and I'm good for the off-season."
Agreed Riley knows better than to throw that out there as a starting lineup. IMO you guys need a 3nD PF like Bobby Portis or a Defensive Hustle C like Robin Lopez and Bring back Dedmon
"bobby portis signed in milwaukee, who also found a way to acquire PJ tucker. Pau Gasol and Nikola Mirotic also went ring chasing in milwaukee at various times over the last couple years. guarantee if denver becomes a title favorite they could also snag a few guys. austin rivers went to denver this year. the point is that is it easier to find role players to fill out the roster than a talent like Kawhi, so you swing that deal for the superstar every time. its easier for glamor markets to get those guys generally, but there are only so many roster spots and minutes to go around"
"Definitely not being discussed, certainly not already agreed upon, no sir  Anyway, the Bucks have been in formal discussions with Bobby Portis"
I'd rather have Bobby Portis and Party Mills
Bobby ‚ÄúNBA Champion Bobby Portis‚Äù Portis
Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis gets overpaid
Man a nice stretch 4 would be beautiful. Bobby Portis would be the best case scenario.
Bobby Portis is tryin to get paid
"Bobby Portis. If not, Malik Monk"
"Kd, Kawhi(hopefully because of ACL), khash money, LeBron, curry. I'd take giannis too, mostly for his defence.   If klay returns atleast 85 or 90% of himself I'd put him there too.    Bobby portis"
Teams sign these former lottery guys every yearX and the few who accept that their future are as a role player tend to carve out a nice career. A couple years ago Bobby Portis was a washed out 1st round bust.
Bobby Portis please
Bobby Portis would like a word
Bobby Portis numbers
Bobby Portis come on down!
$9.5 mil? That's Bobby Portis numbers
Bobby portis would like to have a word with you
"Bulls fan here, obviously wish Portis the best, loved him on the Bulls (sorry Mirotic!) and super happy to do him win a ring, but wasn't he in the doghouse for quite a bit in Milwaukee? I feel like he wasn't getting minutes in the playoffs until Giannis went down, and then coach was like oh yeah, I guess Bobby can play. Am I wrong about that?  If that's the case, I think he'd take his payday elsewhere, but you never know. Bobby seems like a hometown discount kind of guy. Whatever he makes is still an incredible amount to a normal person."
Bobby Bucks bucket Portis
"A role player having a good game happens all the time. Mike Miller in the finals, Mario chalmers, Bobby portis had big games, it happens.   And yeah nets don‚Äôt need a super team to beat the bucks they‚Äôre the worst champion since probably the 06 heat they‚Äôre not very strong"
Bobby Portis is on less than the taxpayer MLE while being a starting caliber C who can hit the 3 with consistency
"Ok. Don‚Äôt care tho tbh. He was talking shit, I did the same. Comparing cities is stupid and pointless anyways because it‚Äôs entirely subjective to the individual‚Äôs personal taste and experiences. And 95% of people that talk shit about Milwaukee or any other city have never even been there so I really don‚Äôt care what they have to say about it. I‚Äôll take the word of Giannis constantly talking about how much he loves Milwaukee or Bobby Portis taking way less money than he deserves to stay in Milwaukee. It‚Äôs a shame the Raps couldn‚Äôt convince Kawhi to stay in Toronto even after they got him a chip tho üò¢"
"It's Bobby Portis *technically* but we all know he's a PF. They have a spare roster spot so hopefully can target someone later in the season if Lopez' injury persists. You should have seen the games where Bobby Portis *and* Brook Lopez were injured, though."
"There was another game. I think when it was just Jrue and the bench the whole game Where Bobby was constantly having to guard perimeter guards and getting blown by. Like, it'd be great if he could stay in front but you also need to know your guys and not people in those situations.  Portis is not the guy with size and foot speed/quickness to stay in front of everyone."
Bobby portis
"but now he‚Äôs on the Team with the most lovable guy in the NBA  On a side note, Bobby Portis has a bad rep coming here too and that seems to be gone or at least going away."

Bobby portis enters the chat
Bobby Portis about that life tho‚Ä¶ dude is from the Rock and will knock you the fuck out.
"Yes, that's literally decisions that have to be made when deciding these types of things....  Bobby Portis joined the Bucks for less than he what he was worth gambling that he can prove his worth and get paid more later. His gamble paid off. He could have stayed where he was and get paid more and he decided to risk it.   Simmons didn't. He wants to have his cake and eat it too  Getting traded and moving is a basic standard across any professional sports league."
"they need to draft better and pick up value among free agents. Milwaukee gets a lot of props for Giannis and Middleton. I would say the Timberwolves are not significantly worse than that first year of Middleton/Giannis. The problem is that it is easy to say ""sign the next Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, draft the next DiVincenzo and Connaughton, trade and long term sign for the next Jrue holiday "" but it is quite difficult to do.  &amp;#x200B;  If I were them I would target Christian Wood as he only has next year on his deal, see what it would take to get Jerami Grant on the team, see what you could get for Rubio. They really need to hit at least two home run signings.  &amp;#x200B;  If they do trade KAT they need to get a mountain of picks back and hit on almost every one of them"
"Me before the season started: Bobby Portis will likely not shoot 47% from 3 again, that's not really sustainable.  Me currently: Bobby Portis will set a league 3PT% record"
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
"Bucks stock is still high. Maybe they dipped a smidge because of recent FUD, but they've had anywhere from 3-4 starters and a few rotation players injured or COVID out for most of the season so far. They were starting Giannis with Grayson Allen, George Hill, Bobby Portis, and now Jrue Holiday. Thanasis and Connaughton started games too, and their Scrabble bench got a bunch of minutes. It's obvious they won't play at the level of their current record but people still think there's actually a dip smh."
"Oh look, you dIdN'T AnSwEr mY qUeStiOn EiThEr....  If you actually watched them last playoffs, I doubt you did with the stupid shit you are saying, they did figure it out. Coach bud did make more adjustments vs years prior. For example, Bobby Portis barely played in the Nets series because he struggled on the switch but played a significant more time against the Hawks and Suns. When Brook Lopez struggled on the switch against the Hawks, coach bud made adjustments and so did Brook when he did play. Bucks were down at some point in almost every series and made adjustments and came back and won. They dominated the heat, swept them in 4 games, revenge series for what happened the year before.   When Giannis' knee bent backwards, Coach bud and the rest of the team made the adjustments and stepped up, beating the Hawks in 6.   During the Suns series, Giannis was literally playing on one leg, team stepped up, he stepped up and also started making his free throws. Everything clicked for Giannis in that game 6 against the suns where he DROPPED 50 POINTS in an NBA FINALS game. GTFOH."
Bobby Portis looks like Robert Downey Jr. as Kirk Lazarus
I figured out who Bobby Portis looks like‚Ä¶ now hear me out‚Ä¶. Eminem
Why does Bobby Portis always fuck us
Bobby Portis for Nerlens Noel  Please excuse me while I go vomit
im just saying it didnt help nikola mirotic when bobby portis started swinging. I thought those american jets gave an attribute bonus
"Punching CP3 isn't much of an achievement, the guy is like the annoying little brat in the school yard who thinks he can take on the bigger boys.  So funny watching him  trying to get past Bobby Portis to whinge at Scott Foster ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Bobby Portis üòÇ
Bobby Portis broke his teammates jaw a few years ago.
Bobby Portis
Bobby ‚Äúcrazy eyes‚Äù Portis? What‚Äôs his tough-o-meter?
"Dude lol...  * Middleton, the second leading scorer on the team has been out the last 5 games due to covid.   * Brook Lopez, the Bucks starting center, has only played 1 game due to back issues and the Bucks don't have a backup center.  * Jrue Holiday, the third or second best player on the team (depending on who you talk to) has only played 4 games so far due to an injury he suffered in the first game of the season.   * Bobby Portis is bouncing back from an injury as well.   Why make a post about something you clearly know nothing about and just trying to be a hater. 5 seconds of googling would have told you all this."
He probably won't have an NBA career and that's a penalty. Teams can't risk Chimeze Metu throwing punches in practice.  He ain't Bobby Portis.
Is that confirmed? I don't disagree with you on that he should be suspended. But remember bobby portis broke mirotic's jaw iirc. Shit like this happens. Suspend him and move on. I'm sure the heat will be extremely physical next time they play in return.
Bobby Portis is the same way
He‚Äôll get 30 tomorrow rebounding over Bobby Portis and Thanasis.
They don‚Äôt have a Jrue and Middleton   or Bobby Portis
"Meh no Middleton, no Lopez. The one that hurts is a lack of Middleton. Once all the starters are back Milwaukee is going on a run. Grayson Allen is a clear upgrade from a guy like Brynn Forbes. Still have the serial killer duo in Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis Jr. When Allen is more of the 6th or 7th guy in the rotation because the team has Middleton back and George Hill is confined to stand in the corner like a PJ Tucker with no defense, that‚Äôs when Milwaukee is back"
"It is pretty far from reality. The bucks haven‚Äôt had their starting lineup since game 1 when they dominated the nets. That‚Äôs also not taking into account Donte, their starting two guard, who‚Äôs still out from last seasons injury until prolly midway through the season. They didn‚Äôt have Bobby Portis or semi ojeley for the first few games (two solid rotation players) and have been without Jrue brook and khris for at least half the games they‚Äôve played so far. Considering the nets should be at the very least a 3 seed and no lower that means the bucks would have to be a 6 seed or lower to face them in the first round. Once they get heathy those wins will start piling up. I‚Äôm looking forward to hopefully another rematch in the second round. That was one of if not the best series of the whole playoffs."

Giannis doesn't get steals in the last few years. When he was the primary on ball defenders he was collecting them but now he is more concerned about not letting his guy get a step on him and go to the rim. In fact you can hear him yelling at Bobby Portis to stop going for steals
&gt; WHAT WAS THE MAJOR ROSTER CHANGE THAT FOSTERED THAT CHAMPIONSHIP?  Bobby Portis
Bobby ‚ÄúNBA champion Bobby Portis‚Äù Portis
That would be way more apt for his former teammate Bobby Portis
"I'm guessing George Hill/Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora/Thanasis Antetokounmpo/Bobby Portis. Portis is likely still on limited minutes, so yeah Sandro Mamukelashvili may see some bigger minutes."
"Who else do Milwaukee have if 7 guys are out.  They basically are running Bobby Portis, Pat C, George Hill and the Washington Generals."
"Bobby *""I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW""* Portis"
bobby portis wins these
"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"

&gt; coolguybobby  &gt; doesn‚Äôt pick Bobby Portis  Wtf man.
"That makes me smile  Edit: The Bobby Portis is playing part, I mean"
Bobby Portis is playing this one - but Semi is out.
"Bobby Portis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Donte Divincenzo are all out on a SEGABABA."
NBA champion Bobby Portis tho
It‚Äôs not about getting Randle. We traded Kp to get off contracts that we signed. And let‚Äôs not forget we also gave 15 million to Bobby Portis
One Bobby Portis please
"Yeah. But you lost him and the Heat gained him.  The question I would ask is, who would you have rather lost?  PJ Tucker or Bobby Portis?"
We‚Äôll take one Bobby Portis please
"Three starters in Jrue, Lopez and Donte, plus Bobby Portis - so just like last time the team doesn't have a player other than Giannis over 6'7, but now there's no Jrue either."
Sabonis would be a good fit or maybe Bobby Portis
who did it better.  This dance after the 3 or bobby portis wb frog running down the court.
"Julius Randle, Bobby Portis"
"But that not a good answer lol. Giannis literally doesn‚Äôt need an outside shot. Jrue, Middleton, Donte, PJ Tucker, shit Bobby fuckin Portis are better outside shooters than he is. I don‚Äôt know why people keep saying he *needs* and outside jumper when it doesn‚Äôt suit his game or our teams game *at all*. It would be like telling Steph Curry he needs to develop a stronger paint presence.   He needs to hit his FT‚Äôs, Middleton needs to stay consistent, and our bench needs to produce. That‚Äôs all we need."
He's Bobby Portis' favourite player as well.
Bobby Portis is a better 3pt shooter than your favourite player
"Bobby Portis, khris Middleton, jordan Nwora, sam merrill, bryn forbes are all shooting over 42% from deep... Jrue is right at 40%. Pat and Donte are both around 38%. We got some good shooters this year"
"This is what happens when you trade a net negative like Bledsoe and you bring in the most underrated player in the entire league that every single team would love to have, Bobby Portis is that much of a game changer"
Pat Connaughton &amp; Bobby Portis are inevitable.
no but Bobby Portis is
Bobby Portis is better than any Heat bench player by a large margin
Power ranking centers in this series:  Brook Lopez  Bobby Portis   Dwayne Dedmon  Bam Hibbert

Dedmon you are not Bobby Portis smh
Yea bobby portis!

Bobby Portis
"They did rest all of the starters in the last game of the season.... plus Pj tucker, Bobby Portis, and Forbes.  The only player that‚Äôs a part of our playoff rotation that even play was Connaughton  https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401307882"
Bobby Portis
bobby mf portis doesnt play these childish games
"This is a winning mindset, and it's paying off. Bobby Portis made eye contact with every other player and said, ""I didn't lose to no Heat.""  The Clippers dodging the hard road, on the other hand? As the prophet saith:  ""Broad and easy to travel is the path that leads the way to destruction and eternal loss."""
"universes were born and destroyed in the span of when bobby portis and jrue fucked up the switch and failed to close out on me  infinite aeons passed, and then I shot the ball"
Lopez is bigger. Not more athletic.   Who else does the bucks have? Bobby Portis?
"Shaq was being pedantic as shit.  The whole problem Kenny and Chuck had is that Jrue Holiday was left on an island and trying to keep Young in front of him while John Collins was lurking to screen him out of the play while Bobby Portis chilled under the rim. Chuck is right, that play was a microcosm of the Bucks defense on Young all game."
Did Bobby Portis even second half minutes
Bobby Portis almost out scored Middleton in 26 less minutes and 15 less shots.
Bobby Portis looks dazed and confused out there
Bobby Portis is a sieve rn
"I guess Bobby Portis doesn't help either, now that Trae and Collins are in rhythm"
"Shush, don't let Bud know to put in Bobby Portis. Got to keep this a close game."
They can play Bobby Portis off the bench
Bobby Portis pat bev East?
Can't believe they're calling that a foul. I'd *pay* to have Bobby Portis fall on me.
imagine getting sat on by bobby portis
Bud really thought he could play Bobby portis and Jeff teague in the Eastern conference finals and get away with it

Bobby Portis won them game 3 and was huge in game 4 and then got 3 straight DNPs.  Maddening.

Bobby Portis sighting?
HOLY FUCK BOBBY PORTIS EXISTS AND IS ON THE TEAM
For reference: he helped Bobby Portis be a top-5 three point shooter in the league this year.
Bobby Portis has cooked us a bunch of times
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
"Put him next to a miles turner or a bobby portis, maybe even kristaps"
"""the same roster"" come on champ - the players improved, I don't know if you can put that all on Thibs. RJ Barrett was always going to develop and julius went to a new level.    Not to mention going from Bobby Portis to Nerlens Noel as back up big is essentially guaranteeing you a top 10 defense. Thibs is quality coach but don't forget he couldn't do much with a talented unit in Minnesota. 1 year sample size is a bit too small imo."
Sign Bobby Portis
"Bobby Portis or Brook Lopez are who come to mind. Bucks must be thinking the same way as you, with Giannis clogging the middle like Simmons would"
"Thanasis isn‚Äôt even the 15th man, he‚Äôs more like the 8th. He got time in game 7 because he‚Äôs carved out this end of the quarter defensive role  - which is more time than Bobby Portis is getting. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to specialize"
Although they were essentially non existent in the Brooklyn series...Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes have been pretty damn good role players all year. I'm curious to see how they matchup with ATL or PHI
He is trash and Bobby Portis was benched to give him minutes. Which is silly because Bobby is so much better. I hope he leaves and comes back to the Knicks.
Bucks should put Giannis on simmons and jrue on Seth   I think brook Lopez and Giannis can handle embiid. I imagine if the bucks play the 76ers Bobby Portis will get some run
What happened to Bobby Portis?
They should fire him even if they win a championship. just getting by on the teams talent. just not getting the job done offensively. His defense is okay but there is no question giannis should have been guarding KD towards the end of games. Almost cost them again and why did Bobby Portis stop getting action he was one of the more consistent players this series on offense and definitely on D. Don't know what his numbers were but you can see his impact on the game.
"No burner accounts, been using this account name for years now, but it's great for me because we picked up Bobby Portis this season."
"Giannis to portis ‚Äúwe gon need you Bobby‚Äù  Lmaooo who you kidding, he‚Äôs going to continue warming that bench"

Manns got the Bobby Portis crazy eyes
Bobby portis isn‚Äôt a guard
when you say 'had to play' elijah bryant i love that it implies some necessity when bud had bobby portis sitting on the bench and chose not to use him in a couple games  fucking hilarious that you get to use bud making boneheaded decisions that *you guys' own fans* were complaining about in the game thread as some sort of 'haha you IDIOTS we're just as disadvantaged'. just like actually the funniest shit
"Because their 3 wins had literally nothing to do with Bud making changes. The biggest change he's made over the series has been to drop Bobby Portis and that seems universally considered a bad idea, and imo correctly so given that Portis played a decent role in their first 2 wins and could have altered game 5 by letting the bucks go small when Lopez was getting cooked by KD in the midrange over and over  Dude's gameplan was literally 'play random' and it shows."
"I think Bucks fans mention it on here pretty regularly.  If our 3P shooting was even slightly below average, we'd already have won the series.  But one of the issues is our best 3P shooter this year by percentage (Portis) is DNP-CD the last 2 games.  And while people may shit on Bud, I think he's right because Bobby is too exploitable on defense by KD.  Since KD is on the court basically 48 minutes a game now, you can't have a guy who bad at drop coverage and not a good 1-on-1 defender in switches."
"Not this Bucks fan. Even if we get the ring he‚Äôs gotta go. IF we end up winning it all it will be because of our players, not Bud. I can‚Äôt take it anymore with him, he didn‚Äôt play Bobby Portis at all last game (Elijah Bryant instead) which hurt us, and he didn‚Äôt play Portis tonight either even though we pulled it out. I‚Äôm up for firing Bud now and bringing in Carlisle‚Ä¶hell even Craig Counsell"
Why is Bobby Portis playing 0 minutes? Makes absolutely no sense to me.
"I don‚Äôt know if I should be surprised or not that Bobby Portis ended up being unplayable in the playoffs. I feel like everyone saw this coming before the season started, but he played well enough in the regular season that some people got their hopes up."
Bobby Portis shot 47% from 3 in the regular season but Bud hasn‚Äôt played him for reasons
"I am officially on the #FireBud bandwagon. I refrained until now and I know they just won, but to not play Bobby ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù Portis aka the Durant Stopper aka Mike Tyson in two straight incredibly crucial games is inexcusable!  I can forgive most of his rotation transgressions like not playing his starters enough because he believes in his bench or whatever his reasoning is, but to have a stone cold killer riding the bench in some of the biggest games in the franchise‚Äôs recent history is utterly asinine and, in my opinion, an offense worthy of being fired."

Vegas always knows, but you can replace a bit of Trae between Bogdan &amp; Huerters playmaking &amp; shot creation + Lou Will might not play that well again but he can create and get some buckets too.  The Bucks are going from Giannis to Pat Connaughton &amp; Bobby Portis. You're losing a dpoy calibre player and their only great threat around the rim on offense."
Shit man we‚Äôre just happy to be here at this point. We‚Äôre having a ton of fun and Bucks fans are a welcome relief after dealing with the Knicks and Sixers. They‚Äôre so annoying  A Knicks fan spit on Trae and we had Sixers fans coming in our game threads calling Trae slurs. Meanwhile you guys are making jokes about Bobby Portis‚Äô eyes lol
"I just looked it up and was surprised Bobby Portis only got 8 games for breaking Mirotic's jaw. But it was also the Bulls who suspended him, not the  NBA. So yeah, based on all that I can't see Beverly getting suspended any longer than that."
Also something happened last night where they were working on his other wrist looks like he got it snagged in I think it was Bobby Portis jersey on a drive
"Also let's not pretend that the Bucks weren't falling for the foul bait. ""The refs helped the Suns because they got a lot of fouls"" instead of ""The Bucks helped the Suns by leaving Bobby Portis and Brooks Lopez on an island vs Booker and CP3""   Watching the game it was a bit skewed with the Suns getting more 50/50 calls but it wasn't at all why the Bucks lost. The Bucks lost because they had no answer for Ayton rolling to the rim and because Jrue had a really rough game on the offensive end."
The refs didn‚Äôt lose the Bucks the game. Bud not adjusting in the third when CP3 and Book were hunting Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis every possession. They almost came back in the 4th because Bud realized he couldn‚Äôt play Bobby or Brook and put Giannis in at the 5
"Bud is never good at in-game adjustments. He‚Äôs good at post game adjustments after watching film and reading Reddit.  Hey Bud,  For the night before the game, please ask Bobby Portis to surprisingly pop-up his head outside of CP3‚Äôs bedroom window just right before nap time with those damn eyes. That should be good enough to prevent him from sleeping the entire night. He‚Äôll be weak by game time and the championship will be ripe for the taking."
Sad that his sauce on Bobby Portis wasn‚Äôt posted.
"Jerami Grant was not shooting the way he is now and is probably going to look for more money, Bobby Portis is playing on a championship team and could easily get paid more, but some players thrive off of bench roles and taking the back seat so idk but Myles Turner is definitely the best non-rookie contract in the NBA. But again, John Collins is 23 and you pay for potential as well when dealing with a player like that. He can very possibly get better at a lot of things considering his age and the current coaching staff"
"That‚Äôs the difference in series, ask guys like Bobby Portis and Jeff Teague"
lmao same. But i was slightly wary of Bobby Portis. CP3 better not light that dynamite
"And leaving Bobby Portis out there so the suns guards can take turns torching him. I don't think he gets minutes the rest of the series, if Bud plays it smart at least."
Bobby Portis got major minutes in this game‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the problem here. Bud needs to make proper adjustments.
The Suns completely neutralized the Buck's best player: Bobby Portis.
Bobby Portis shouldn't get any minutes.
When the losing team plays Brynn Forbes Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis extended minutes in the Finals the coach is rigged
i need a gif of cam payne losing his mind after CP3 cooks bobby portis for the layup
Bobby Portis reaching for a steal on CP3 gave us one of the best highlights of the day
Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton are not 1st and 2nd options off the bench on a championship team
I Googled his age and Bobby Portis Jr being 26 is fucking hilarious to me for some reason.
poor bobby portis.  he's in no mans land

I love Bobby Portis. He‚Äôs got them crazy eyes
"I‚Äôm here for some more Bobby Portis, jr antics. I hope he gets a ton of playing time this series"
Let me welcome y'all to the Bobby Portis Show.
"For instance, Miles Turner, who's been shopped all over the league @ 17 Mil.  Bobby Portis who's only getting paid like 3.6 Mil or Jerami Grant who's only on a 3 yr 60 Mil deal. or Robert Covington ,etc etc etc."
How about Bobby Portis vs Mirotic?
"""Talking with Jrue, he told me that everything he's accomplished up until now can actually be attributed to his *cats.*""  *Portis makes a deeep three from the logo.*  ""^As ^Bobby ^ties ^up ^the ^game‚Äì So Jrue explained that as he trains, he likes to have his cats nearby to cheer him on. He says their energy is what motivates him to keep going.""  *Chris Paul crosses up Lopez, drives to the basket, then dishes it behind the back to Ayton for the slam, crowd is going wild*  ""^DeAndre ^for ^two. So According to Jrue, his cats Neil and Simon, named after his favorite musical artist, will stay with him in the training room for hours, playing on their indoor scratching post and even climbing on some of the training equipment, haha. Jrue told me he knows he can finally call it a day when they curl up for a nap. I asked him, did he ever think that a couple of cats could be such good trainers?""  *Middleton throws an absolute bomb of an inbound pass down the court to a wide open Giannis who flies from the  three-point line all the way to the basket and literally shatters the backboard.*  ""^Timeout ^called ^on ^the ^court. Jrue replied that if his cats didn't believe in him, then he wouldn't have believed in himself and probably wouldn't have made it this far in his career. Quite the journey to take to his first Finals, Mike."""
"My favorite part is knowing Bobby Portis talks in the 3rd person when he talks to himself   ‚ÄúCmon, Portis‚Äù"
Bobby Portis‚Äô crazy eyes going to win MVP
"Not Dante OR Portis. Dante AND Portis(and we might not have been able to get Tucker either). We would have traded Dante and been unable to sign Portis.  Bogdan is clearly a better player than either of them. But the Bucks already have a short bench and it would have been even shorter without Bobby.  In the Bucks situation, I think Dante+Bobby helped more than Bogdan would."
&gt;I'm not sure I would take Bogdan over Dante and Bobby.  Bogi almost just had a 50/40/90 season (47.3/43.8/90.9).  You would be in the small minority if you would take Dante or Portis over Bogdan.
You Suns fans about to find out why we hate Bobby Portis ( No not literally but fuck that guy for going off against us )
He won't cuz Bobby Portis gon win it

Unleashing Bobby Portis early I see
"I agree with all, but Bobby Portis? BOBBY PORTIS? What?"
"Swaggy p, birdman, Bobby Portis, JJ Barea"
"Yes.  Did you know that Bud adjusted this year after all the criticism and instituted more switching? Did you also know that CP3 and Booker are two of the best in the league -- CP3 literally one of the best ever -- from midrange, which is the exact weakness that killed the Bucks the past three years?  Bud got legit criticism because he's been slow to make adjustments. It's not just r/NBA, it's guys like Zach Lowe and John Hollinger who've written about it. Here's Hollinger from today:  *While Lopez is a master at this coverage and showed in the conference finals that he can play ‚Äúdrop‚Äù even against a player like Trae Young, who most teams wouldn‚Äôt chance it against, the Suns are an even steeper challenge. Paul is one of the best shooters ever from the free-throw-line area, while Booker has exceptional craft in either getting pull-ups or blasting off on the way to the rim. Against backup Payne, the Bucks are more likely to feel comfortable playing drop, especially since Payne has the speed to roast switches.      The Bucks can play switching lineups too, especially if they pull Lopez off the floor and opt to play Giannis as their center. That arrangement puts Pat Connaughton in at the wing and immediately forces Ayton into a tough spot at the other end, where he either must guard Giannis or stand in the corner with P.J. Tucker. Alas, the Bucks are going to try to roll with a 6.5-man rotation as much as possible, which means Lopez almost certainly must play at least half of each game regardless. I have a hard time seeing how Bryn Forbes stays on the court against the Suns‚Äô guards, and Bobby Portis could have a tough time defensively as well.*"
Brook Lopez  Bobby Portis  Guy on the bench who vaguely looks like Sisqo  Huge gap  Giannis  Booker  CP3
give me a little bobby portis and a single quarter for middleton
"I finally have a win win NBA Finals, on the one hand, after that magnificent season with the Thunder i go to see how CP3 can make a team better through leadership and brotherhood.  on the other hand Bobby Portis is an Arkansas alum and i would be so excited to see him with a ring this early in his career."
Bron gonna be turning into Bobby Portis
Bobby ‚Äúrigor mortis‚Äù Portis
You forgot Bobby Portis. He always steps up big when Giannis is out.
Apparently [Bobby Portis doesn't](https://twitter.com/bucks/status/1357024111000768512?s=21).
"I think they target and can possibly land Devonte Graham, Richaun Holmes, Bobby Portis, Forbes and David Nwamba in FA. Try and use a S/T w/ lonzo and picks (maybe need 3rd team ~rockets?~) to get CJ away from the blazers"
Bobby Portis warm the bench on specific situations.
"Bobby Portis is in the same tier as Bogi, Collins, and Capela?! The guy was barely getting any minutes before Giannis went down and is getting paid 1.4 million."
Bobby ‚ÄúFreak in the Streets‚Äù Portis

&gt;and ~~Jeff Teague~~ Bobby Portis  Fixed that
Bobby Portis will scare Ayton shitless. No need for the Freak to step in
Bobby Portis once knocked his teammate out cold in practice.
Same with spooky eyed Bobby Portis
"Yes, fundamentally the same team unless you completely ignore reality.  &amp;#x200B;  I guess Jrue Holiday, Bobby Portis, and PJ Tucker don't exist.  Totally the same team as long as you don't count two starters being replaced and a huge bench upgrade.  Stop posting you are embarrassing yourself"
do the bucks really need giannis if they have Bobby Portis???
We've had Holiday and Bobby Portis for 1 season calm down lmao.
He can never be #1 during a time when Bobby ‚ÄúDarrell from MADtv eyes‚Äù Portis is eligible.
"Totally different skill sets. Jaylen Brown was theoretically the two-way wing that everyone wants and his development bore that out. Collins is harder to fit into a modern team as a big man tweener-type who isn't particularly rangy (he's one of those players who shoots a good percentage from 3 but doesn't take them enough to command a ton of attention out there), doesn't pass much and isn't really a good defender. The Hawks would be better off paying someone like Bobby Portis a fraction of that, or finding the next Portis/Wood etc off the scrap heap if they really want that archetype of player."

That Scott Williams suspension was terrible.  He wasn't some great player but he was that year Bucks Bobby Portis tough guy/Pat Connaughton hustle guy.  Losing him was a big blow on top of the shit reffing.

"You could replace ‚Äúscoring‚Äù with rebounding or rim protection or floor management or energy and it would still be correct. Bobby Portis was a great sixth man last night, and scoring wasn‚Äôt the main reason for it."
"Exactly. I thought Bobby Portis was about to be shipped out to the Chinese league after that bullshit, but they both turned into great teammates in their own way."

"&gt; Tbh I could‚Äôve signed for 3-4 times what I‚Äôm making this year elsewhere. Wasn‚Äôt about the money this year for me. Was more about respect more than anything. Also, just from a fit standpoint I thought I would fit in well.  From [Bobby Portis' twitter](https://twitter.com/bportistime/status/1354893422696558596?lang=en)"
"Ayton was ok against Giannis on defense, dominated early offensively. Got into foul trouble in the 3rd, which meant yet another Giannis masterclass. Jrue Holiday was on fire in the 3rd, Bobby Portis and Rebounding eventually blew the game wide open"
"I‚Äôve watched the clip of that Bobby Portis play like 3 times in a row and I see where Giannis is saying something to Middleton after the foul but it just looked like a teammate seeing something on the floor that he thought they could either be doing better or something that they could take advantage of and was letting him know. That‚Äôs kind of what leaders of teams do. Nobody on the planet would bat an eye if a Jordan, LeBron, or Kobe was caught in the background doing that. Seems like kind of fishing for reasons to criticize if I‚Äôm being honest."
No one thought Kuzma had star potential lol  At his best people looked at him like they look at Bobby Portis now.  Young role player with upside.

totally written by bobby portis
"Man why couldn‚Äôt Jrue have continued playing terrible basketball against us. It‚Äôs like Bud told the whole team some shit just to want to beat ATL, then go back to being ass lmao. If it wasn‚Äôt for Kris and Jrue playing their best basketball that they have literally ever played, Hawks are in the finals right now. Shit, I wanted to see Kris and Jrue give the Suns issues like they did with us and it‚Äôs why I was rooting for the Bucks but no, for the entire series against us they just had to be phenomenal on every level of basketball and then immediately going back to almost unplayable‚Ä¶ Like Bobby Fucking Portis"
"Maybe a bit biased, but I don't like Dwayne Wade ever since he used the Bulls for a final payday and caused a massive riff in the locker room. At the end of January, Dwade convinced Jimmy to collectively throw the young players under the bus in a post game press conference.  Rajon Rondo, being an understanding vet went off on Dwade on Instagram, all three faced fines and the young players jumped on twitter to defend themselves. The Bulls went on a massive downward losing swing after this. Then around March, after Dwade got hurt, the Bulls led by Rajon Rondo, Jimmy B, and the young players went on a run to secure the 8th seed. Bulls take 2-0 lead against the Celtics on the road behind Rondo, Paul Zipser, Jimmy Butler, and Bobby Portis. Rondo breaks his thumb and misses the rest of the series, Dwade plays like absolute trash. We eventually Lose 4-2 to Celtics. Jimmy is traded, Rajon was waived, and Dwade was bought out. The bulls haven't won more than 27 games since until this season where we won 31."

"Bucks are fucked  Who is gonna take Middleton and Jrue now with their loaded ass deals?  Middleton is due 36M, 38M, and 40M in the next three seasons   Meanwhile, Jrue Holiday is due 31M, 33M, 36M, and 38M (in 2024-2025 oof!)  PJ Tucker is making 8M a year and he is unrestricted - will they be able to go over the cap to sign him?  Bobby Portis will opt out and try to get a new deal - doubt he returns.  So at best you run the same squad minus Bobby Portis at worst you run the same team without Tucker/Portis who both played huge minutes in these playoffs.  Middleton could probably be traded for two role players but you arent getting someone back with similar production so you have to stay with him  Same goes with Jrue who is going to pay him 33M next year when he only put up 18pts / 6 assists"
Only person I‚Äôd trust to contest a wide open 3 with their eyes is Bobby Portis

"&gt; Their shot at the bag comes with team success.   Bobby Portis made 60% of his career earnings last year, with a terrible Knicks team, after years of playing for failing Bulls teams. Team success does not mean shit to a lot of players earning power."
Bobby Portis
They still are not going to give up their shot at the bag.  Bobby Portis made 60% of his career earnings last year. Pat Connaughton almost doubled his career earnings this year. Every team has a few rookies to third year players who have short shelf lives.    LeBron's interests are not at all aligned with the common player.
&gt; That‚Äôs not the case for probably 90% of the league and cutting the season short would impact how much money the players would have made.   That number is probably 99%.   Every season matters a ton for the bottom half of the league. Bobby Portis made 60% of his career earnings last year. Pat Connaughton almost doubled his career earnings this year. Every team has a few rookies to third year players who have short shelf lives.
Bobby Portis is the epitome of you love him when he's on your team but you hate him if you're playing against him
"It wasn't just Giannis.  It was paying Khris Middleton a max.  It was signing Brook Lopez when he was fired by Los Angeles, and then giving him a raise.  It was acquiring Pat Connaughton for nothing. It was acquiring Bobby Portis.   It was drafting Done Di Vincenzo, and it was getting rid of Thon Maker when he turned into what people thought Giannis would become.  It was backing up the truck for Eric Blesoe, and then backing it up again for Jrue Holliday.  Just Giannis doesn't win a chip."

It paid off. And now it will pay off. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he was in this situation in the first place. He was in the same spot Jabari Parker was in when he chose Atlanta. The league didn‚Äôt view him as the $20 Million player the Bulls made him. Just like Portis wasn‚Äôt viewed as the $15 Million player the Knicks made him. Jabari took the money to showcase his abilities on a bad team. It didn‚Äôt work out. Bobby made the right choice, but he is still the same player he was last offseason."
"Lol, what do you consider stacked? Bobby portis, A traditional Center and 36 yr old 6' 5"" PF-C vet that avgs 2-3 pts a game?    Sit down nephew.    Bucks werent a stacked team, they have Middleton, Greek Freak, and a solid core."
Close. Then you mix that with a weekend of doing coke with Metta World Peace and you have Bobby Portis
"I said it in basically every Bucks game thread in the playoffs, Bobby Portis is actually Eminem gone Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder."
"I honestly think saying stuff like this is meant to make simple minded people feel better. Giannis is the perfect example of preparation meets opportunity. Worked his ass off and happened to be in a fortunate position.   There are times you can completely prepared and the opportunity never materializes. Ex: Dame. There are times the opportunity materializes and you aren't prepared for it. Ex: LeBron 2011. There are a ton of other examples but yea. This makes it seem like the people that don't succeed didn't ""want it enough"" and that just irritates me to my core.  These empty ass platitudes make people feel better but it regurgitates that often BS ""Work harder than everyone else and you'll succeed"" but ignores that most NBA players are some of the hardest working people in the sport - they made it to the NBA - most will never achieve their dreams of being a champion, or a deep playoff run, or an MVP, or an All-star, or what have you. Crazy to think most will fail at the things they've dedicated their lives towards. It's why we love Bobby Portis and Cam Payne, literally were bottom of the barrel at one point. Stayed prepared then finally got the opportunity to showcase that."
"Of our starting 5, Khris is the only ""good"" 3pt shooter. Brook and Jrue are average to below average if you look at rheir careers and not just this season, PJ is only good in the corner and Giannis is awful. And Bryn was unplayable when he wasn't hitting shots (which was evert game after the Miami series). That leaves Pat and Bobby to go along with Khris to shoot 3s reliably, and Portis barely played until the Finals. So it kinda makes sense that our 3pt% would talk considering the primary drivers of that % in the regular season were barely taking any shots"
Bobby Portis is a legend. Go Hogs!
"Is Bobby Portis just a younger taller JR Smith, but got defense?"
Chris Paul wants minis too but Bobby Portis is just standing in front the window
High Bobby Portis Crazy eyes minutes ü§™
"Improve the bench in a variety of ways. Namely, getting a bucket getter that isn‚Äôt just a spot up shooter (see Bryn Forbes). I think the perfect player to fill this role would be Terrence Ross, and he should be easy to get from the Magic since he doesn‚Äôt fit their timeline. Bench defense could also be improved, since their only serviceable wings off the bench are Tucker (if Donte is healthy) and Connaughton. A Brook Lopez trade could also be a good option to bring in multiple role players to fill out the bench, since Bobby Portis/Giannis at the 5 lineups proved successful in these playoffs."
"He's no Bobby Portis, but he's a handsome man."

Yep. Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes were both very good 3P shooters in the regular season (3rd and 4th in the NBA in 3P%) but it didn't translate when the stakes were raised.

"&gt;Think of a rip through, a player is just reaching in making no contact until the shooter initiates the contact.   On a rip through, the offensive player isn't hooking the other guy lol they're just creating contact. This is not remotely the same. If Booker was actually going up for a shot he wouldn't have held onto the defenders arm like he did. I am 100% glad they didn't reward that bullshit. Hooking a defender like that needs to be an offensive foul, really.   Here is a CP3 rip through compilation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_63cSR93Zc  What is missing? Grabbing the defender.   &gt;Curious what you think of the whistle Giannis got on the other end: https://go.nba.com/oifn  Would love to see a better angle of the second call that isn't from 50 feet away, but off that replay both are not fouls. Especially in the playoffs.   However, you're comparing one guy(Giannis) who doesn't flop or embellish and plays through a fuck ton of contact. On the other hand, you have Booker who makes embellishment and bitching at the refs an art form. Booker probably gets that call if he doesn't hook and hold(or spend the entire game flailing after every shot). The Suns have also spent the entire series fouling Giannis instead of letting him get the easy bucket, so maybe that's an anticipation call(not saying those are correct, but they happen).   I'm also of the opinion that NBA officials are hesitant to call things against certain guys and make up for it by calling shit on other lesser known guys(Bobby Portis had absolute bullshit called on him all night last night, for example).   So you can't put 2 calls in a vacuum like that."
"Mirotic went from being Euroleague MVP to an NBA afterthought. My guess is he was frustrated with his career, and apparently he wasn't loved in the Bulls locker room.  ""[The players](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/8/16626286/bobby-portis-nikola-mirotic-timeline-beef-fight-practice) had been talking trash to one another in practice, going back and forth before those exchanges escalated into a physical encounter, league sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Mirotic charged at Portis twice before Portis threw a punch and connected with Mirotic's face, league sources said.""  Then Mirotic demanded he or Bobby be traded, and multiple players said off the record that they'd rather Portis stay. He also tried reaching out to Mirotic, who never responded."
Gonna stick up for Bobby Portis on this one. Legitimately he was like their second best three point threat in terms of gravity this playoffs -- although that itself tells you a lot
"Depends on the package + other moves (a la Bobby Portis, PJ moves)"
"I wasn‚Äôt saying that a year ago, but ok.  The upgrade from Bledsoe to Jrue was more like the missing piece.  But the Bucks organization deserves credit for bringing in guys like Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, and Bobby Portis.  Also for extending Middleton when some thought that they overpaid.  They did a good job building around Giannis."
Who knew Bobby Portis was going to be the most important free agent signing of 2020
Bobby Portis cartoonishly running to the other side of the court is embedded in my memory lmao.
Bobby Portis' ceremony speech is what finally got me
"Idk about an asshole, but Bobby Portis is not afraid to punch you in the face if you piss him off."
"What‚Äôs funny is they really underperformed as a spacing team. They shot 4% below their regular season 3pt% average, with Khris seeing a drop down to 35.6% and Lopez all the way down at 23.8%. The guys who kept their shooting together ended up being Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton."
That shit actually happened and it's why his career has kind of been random. He's not like a starter talent or anything but I've always felt he was good enough to be a consistent role player but the bulls couldn't keep him when he did that to nikola mirotic. Who is no longer in the league I think. Considering how likeable he has been on the bucks by his entire team I'm pretty confident it was a one off where mirotic probably said/did something he shouldn't have.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2739275-nikola-mirotic-reportedly-hospitalized-after-fight-with-bobby-portis-at-practice.amp.html

I‚Äôve been so pissed this entire postseason watching them barely get by (except against my heat lol) I was pissed watching them beat the hawks twice without Giannis. I was pissed watching them reverse sweep the suns. Then I saw Giannis right after they won. Why was I so mad? He deserves it. Damn he played his heart out. Heat lost to the champs. Respect.

https://youtu.be/ETWA8GWtaV8  Bobby Portis running after technical foul
"I wasn‚Äôt directly rooting for them (until the finals), but I did watch all their games and I agree. They were always a team full of talent that never really capitalized that and it felt like they‚Äôd figure it out one game then forget that winning formula the next. However, in the finals, especially after game 2 of course, they finally got some consistency that we all expected them to hit and they hit it at the perfect time. I left really impressed. I loved seeing Middleton show up when he was needed the most, Jrue played horribly offensively most of the series, but his playmaking and defense really came through huge, Tucker played with a lot of grit and was a huge contributor defensively, Bobby Portis as Bobby Portis, Pat‚Äôs hustle on rebounding was insane, and of course, Giannis played with an amazing heart and determination, one of my favorite all time finals performances. I really am happy for all Bucks fans to see this team win it all, one of the most likable teams out there in the league and it‚Äôs all mainly with home grown superstars in a small market which deserves praise in itself."
"Paul walks straight into Portis who isn‚Äôt looking towards him at all and puts hands on him at the same time Bobby put hands on Paul. Sure, Bobby may have kept working the hands for a few seconds but Paul is also shoving and pushing trying to move through him. Paul isn‚Äôt entitled to the space that Portis is currently occupying just because the ref is on the opposite side of him"

"Giannis and Holiday are impossible to hate. Really great and devoted players. Although Bobby Portis constantly looks like he‚Äôs going to kill a chicken with his bare hands, he‚Äôs kinda funny. Middleton yelling at Portis after his tech really earned him some points in my book, that‚Äôs a level-headed move.  Obviously I wished the Suns pulled it out, but I‚Äôd rather lose to that team in the finals than the Nets, and I‚Äôm especially glad we beat LA."

Bucks legend Bobby Portis
Bc frank is not good and only scored bc Bobby Portis doesn‚Äôt understand switching and defense
"For a second Giannis, wasn't sure what happened. It was just a sudden light-headed feeling, as if he stood up too fast. He looked around at his surroundings, sensing both the familiarity and differences in the team locker room. But before he could assess what had just happened, a familiar face walked up to him.   Glancing up at Bobby Portis' medusa-like gaze, he dapped up his teammate. As if on auto-pilot, his hand moved on its own, finishing the once-familiar handshake that he had performed 5 years prior.  ""You Ready?"" Bobby asked.  Giannis took another look around the locker room, glancing up at the whiteboard - seeing the game plan of his first championship win.   ""right, this the night i dropped 50.""  He didn't question the why or how, just that there was a game to win. Giannis walked out of the locker room with a knowing smirk.  ------halftime game 6------  Monty Williams: He won't keep hitting them. Just forget about it. No one goes from a sub 30% three point shooter to 6/9 over night! It's just a hot streak! Keep giving him that shot, the coach implored.  Ayton and CP3 looked at each other, stunned at what was transpiring. There was no denying it; the form was completely different. Gone was the slow, elbows-flared-too far out jumpshot. In it's place was something so smooth that it made CP3 question whether they were coming from Giannis or Khris?    ""Yo, whatever is going -""  ""I got this Khris. I'm gonna keep shooting"" Giannis interrupted. He smiled at his teammate, knowing full well what the next 2 seasons of consistent post-practice shooting sessions had done for his shot."
Exactly. I‚Äôm a believer that Curry will be about this good for another 2 or 3 years. You don‚Äôt need to sell out for this particular year. And I forgot to mention they‚Äôd still have the MLE to add good players. Bobby Portis and Serge Ibaka were MLE‚Äôs last year.
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
"Chris Paul got punted by Bobby Portis. Which pretty much summarizes that whole finals, that whole series and his whole career. Short guy frustrations"
"Each of the Bucks acquisitions had a big role in each series: - Bryn literaly-better-than-Steph-against-the-Heat Forbes was great in the first series - PJ Tucker was huge against the Nets - Jrue was great all playoff long defensively, but against the Hawks he closed it out on offense, as well - Bobby Portis was great in game 6  Can't ask for more than that, really."
"Watch for another CP choke‚Ä¶ in all seriousness I would say how much better the Bucks defended the P&amp;R as the series went on. Oh, and Bobby Portis highlights."
Very happy for PJ bc when Harden abandoned the Rockets he still was a professional. I‚Äôm glad for Bobby Portis who was maligned by white NBA media after he punched out Mirotic with the Bulls. Portis really increased his value these playoffs
"Nah dawg, my heart valves are open like Bobby Portis‚Äô eyes"
"Kevin Love literally was not an all-star when the Cavs won. By what definition was he a star player in 2016?  &gt;I never said it has to be ""superstars"" I was making fun of you trying to use Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez as your examples  You're making fun of yourself because it is YOUR definition of superteam that makes these trades/free agents part of the formation of a superteam.  Also another change from ""superstar"" to ""star"". You ever gonna figure out what you're talking about?"
"I never said it has to be ""superstars"" I was making fun of you trying to use Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez as your examples   And if you don't think Kevin Love was a star player at the time, then you are new to watching basketball and didn't see him on the T Wolves"

"No, you just have a bullshit definition of superteam. You're saying if a team drafts Kawhi, Steph, and Lebron it's not a superteam just because they drafted them?

"Now is the chance to tell my Bobby Portis story.  It was 4am at Waffle House (the one on MLK, those familiar with Fayetteville). As I was housing down my hash browns, I look over to the counter and see none other than Bobby Portis. I wanted to go up and congratulate him on the monstrous game he had that night, but the man was clearly busy.  He was with two girls, his left arm around one and his right arm around the other. I think they were both hypnotized by his freakish ghoul eyes as they both couldn‚Äôt break eye contact with him, neither aware of the other one‚Äôs presence. He turned to one and began making out with her, still not breaking eye contact. Then he turned to the other girl and did the same. Back and forth and back and forth, an endless cycle of tongue wrestling. He left shortly after, both girls still in his arms. As he was leaving, he made eye contact with me and nodded. I like to think he was trying to hypnotize me as well.  I hope they all had a wonderful night together."

Even though I think it‚Äôs normal for us ordinary people to be like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between $6 million and $40 million?‚Äù there is definitely a huge difference. Especially when you consider that most NBA players retire by their early-30s and don‚Äôt really have other career options/skills, it‚Äôs important to secure the future of yourself and your family while you can.   It would be great if Portis gets his bag and maybe comes back to us later in his career.

Lol just tuned in‚Ä¶is Booker pulling in the Bobby Portis look??
Bobby portis.
Who the fuck is Bobby Portis?
"""Small markets just hit different""    - Bobby Portis"
Don't forget Bobby Portis
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
"If Bobby Portis wanted to, he could harness is full power and sweep the league for the rest of eternity.   The fact that such a powerful and earth-shattering force of nature can also have such immense restraint is a modern marvel.   If Portis chose to unleash his full power, may god help us all‚Ä¶"
Bobby Portis chose the opposite and will never be forgotten by Milwaukee
"I feel like the Lakers getting so much coverage on ESPN makes even NBA GMs overvalue their players. Schroeder is a low end starting PG with a bad record as a teammate, and Harrel and Kuzma are Bobby Portis type role players on a good day. I don't see how they get any value from trading them"
"Exactly right. Delon is a good backup guard, which at #18 is perfectly fine turnout for a pick; the only players after him you can make an argument for being better are Bobby Portis and Richuan Holmes. Poeltl was the consensus pick at #9 in 2016 and he's turned into a very good center - not a star player, but someone you would trust to anchor your team in almost any situation."
"&gt;	who is our starter  who is our SECOND TEAM ALL NBA PF  We could‚Äôve gotten zero production from any of our other FA signings that year and it still would‚Äôve been a massive success. Even without Randle, we got two guys that were valuable contributors this year and another that we flipped for a first rounder that turned into Immanuel Quickley, and it‚Äôs not like Bobby Portis was bad either"
"I wonder if they could get Duncan Robinson, Melo and or Bobby Portis or even trade for someone like Bryn Forbes."
Bobby Portis isn‚Äôt listed on here lol
"PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are all free agents tho"
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
Bobby Portis hopefully
"Even with Ross and Delon, they were packaged for Ibaka and Gasol which led to the chip.  The only player drafted after Ross within reason you can argue for is Drummond and with JV already on the roster (and JV being better than Drummond) it was the right pick. The ten picks after Drummond were Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, Mo Harkless, Royce White, Tyler Zeller, Terrence Jones and Andrew Nicholson. Getting Ross is a W for Masai and the Raptors.  With Delon, he was drafted 20th so getting someone who was a first guard off the bench player is a good return on that. The players drafted after him in the first round were Justin Anderson, Bobby Portis, Rondae, Tyus Jones,  Jarrell Martin, Nikola Milutinov, Larry Nance Jr, RJ Hunter, Chris McCullough and Kevon Looney. Other than Looney, Delon is good return based on the picks after, I don't consider this a miss.  Bruno was a miss no doubt though. But hey, we got the Raptors 905 built up because of him so in the grand scheme of things it worked out lol  So yeah, **basically** (key word basically) all our picks have hit. Other than Bruno we haven't missed a pick."
And Bobby Portis!
Your team traded your 1st round pick this year on March 25th the Bulls went on to go 12-16 and completely miss the playoffs. Over that same time period the Wolves also went 12-15. Like why the fuck are you talking about the Wolves dude. At least the Wolves have drafted KAT and Ant over the last 6 drafts who is the best Bull to be drafted in the same time period? Bobby Portis? Coby White?     I guess yall did draft Jokic then traded him away for Doogie McBuckets.
What about The Eye Dropper? It's a top rope elbow drop but with Bobby Portis' eyes
Bryn Forbes is going elsewhere. I'd expect Bobby Portis to look to get paid. And the Bucks seem destined to look for another stretch-four to replace him.
"I cannot emphasize this enough... if Bobby Portis gets in a wrestling ring, it just might be the greatest display of strength and violence we have ever seen. No one man can contain Portis. It was only through his self-control that he didn‚Äôt absolutely eviscerate the Suns on his own.   If he‚Äôs put in an environment where his only goal is to compete against another man... then god help us all."
Josh Primo will be Caris Levert level of impact   Tre Mann will be an all star level player    Bones Hyland is going to be at least a 15 ppg scorer in the league. I genuinely think you take him top 20 and wouldn‚Äôt be mad at anyone in the back half of the lotto   Jeremiah Robinson Earl will slip and be such an immediate impact people will be like how could we let another villanova guy slip.   I agree with your Santi Aldama pick but I‚Äôm going to one up it and say Sandro Mamukelishvili is going to be an impact offensive player off the bench immediately. The guy is an NBA player hands down. He‚Äôs Bobby Portis with slightly more playmaking flare
"Why is Cristiano Felicio, who will absolutely be out of the league, Tier 4 while Bobby Portis, Kelly Olynyk etc are tier 5 lol  I‚Äôll miss shrek"
Bobby Portis stepping between Chris Paul and Scott Foster.
"How are players like Jeff Green, Bobby Portis, Nic Batum, and Bruce Brown 5th tier? All these guys are pretty good role players"
"It's a mindset for a lot of players and fans in basketball - the notion that you must hate your opponent in order to beat him. I'll always enjoy the sportsmanship displayed by guys like Jrue Holiday, Bobby Portis, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, and players alike."
"If Bud, Jrue, and Giannis can get Bobby Portis playing solid defense in the Finals than Jordan Nwora is far from a lost cause. It‚Äôs mainly IQ issues and he‚Äôs 6‚Äô8‚Äù with a 6‚Äô11‚Äù wingspan."
"If you want team loyalty there's Damian Lillard and the Portland Trailblazers. He's arguably  the first player that pops up in my mind whenever I hear the word ""loyal"" in the NBA (mostly because he preaches it himself). Their history is also pretty respectable, they've had the Bill Walton days and their first ring, then moved on to the Clyde Drexler days, then the Oden - Aldridge - Roy days, and now the Damian Lillard era. Their social media team is good, they interact a lot with fans. Their organization is meh, their aim every season is to become a good playoff team with no championship aspirations (although now that Dame is demanding them to make moves for a championship). I would be really careful tho, there has been reports that Dame could want out of Portland so take that as you will.  Another team that screams loyalty is the Milwaukee Bucks. The history is composed of the Kareem days (one of the GOATs in basketball) winning their first championship, then to the Ray Allen days (late 90s to early 00s) and then to the Michael Redd era, then to the Brandon Jennings era. From then on, it has been downhill but their lives would change when they drafted their superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was once a Greek kid that came to America with literally nothing, and he was alone here, trying to carve a role here in the NBA. He has been through some absolute highs and lows with this Bucks team (at least from when he was a rookie up to now), and now he's one of the most beloved players in the league right now. They had 2 seasons of being contenders (one was where they kind of flopped after everyone expected them to win) and now he has carried the Bucks to its 2nd championship, along with Khris Middleton (another loyal guy who stuck with the Bucks together with Giannis) and Jrue Holiday (a guy they traded for). Their fan interaction is crazy, they have this running gag with player Bobby Portis where he's absolutely a fan favorite and they chant his name every game and stuff. They have a youtube channel where they show behind the scenes stuff (this is why i became a fan, i binged it all and they look so absolutely cool). Their org is also meh (but only recently they did good, they've done more sus moves like Kidd hiring and draft fuckups like DJ Wilson and Thon Maker).  Overall supporting these teams would be really fun especially the Bucks, since they all seem to be really chill."
"Mix AD and bobby Portis and you get KG, yes?"
"The Bucks have the coolest team. Giannis is just the epitome of likability, its impossible not to like him with that babyface and accent. And just story in general. Middleton is calm and collected, doesn't get a lot of attention, but has always been underrated. Jrue, one of the best wing defenders in the game, has gone through a lot with his family and the scares earlier in his career. He worked so hard to get where he is. Brook Lopez, one of the biggest nerds in the league. PJ Tucker, the shoe junkie. Bobby ""punch Mirotic in the face"" Portis. Pat Connaughton, ""the most athletic white guy ever."" Yeah, I like this team."
Bobby Portis
thats what bobby portis thought and got his ass crossed
"Yeah, I think this is the biggest adjustment the Bucks have to make. When the big switches onto Chris Paul make him drive. He obviously can drive, he just doesnt want to do it every play. He had that layup where he crossed over Bobby Portis"
A shooter who can‚Äôt shoot. A versatile player who can only play one position because he can‚Äôt defend wings or bigs lmao.   Don‚Äôt compare the dude to Bobby Portis. He plays half the minutes Portis does and doesn‚Äôt do anything as well. It‚Äôs literally not comparable.
"Playoffs is about adjustments. Having a big who can shoot and as versatile sa Dario is always nice to have in your backpocket. Ask the Bucks if having Bobby Portis just available was a big deal in the Hawks series.  Plus you know, this playoffs just likes unpleasant surprises like injuries. Hope no one else gets hurt and the injured dudes recover without much trouble"
Bobby Portis
"Bobby Portis : ""Hello police?! CP3 tryin to beat me up"
"&gt; Holiday wasn‚Äôt aggressive at all and I didn‚Äôt see him drawing any fouls.  He took 8 shots in the paint and got called for a foul once. He quit being aggressive cuz he was having a horrible game.  &gt; Bucks had to end the game with Bobby Portis  Portis played 25 seconds in the 4th quarter. Seriously dude, what the fuck are you even saying? You're literally just making shit up lmao  &gt; Giannis‚Äôs 20 points in 35 minutes is a far cry from the 28 points in 33 minutes he averaged in the regular season.  Did you not see his significant knee injury 7 days before this game? Giannis performed exceptionally well given his issues. You really do ignore shit and make up other shit to fit some narrative that for some reason, only you can see - which is evident by people calling your bullshit out in your post.  &gt; If you don‚Äôt believe that Jar Crowder affects Giannis go check his stats in the series against the Heat last year.  If holding a man with a significant knee injury to 20 points on 55% FG shooting is what Jae allows then I fucking hope he keeps covering Giannis lmao  &gt; I didn‚Äôt get upvotes because snowflakes you get triggered when the truth gets told  LMAO THERE IT IS. I love how when ignorant people call the dozens of other people pointing out how they're wrong snowflakes instead of admitting they're wrong.   This entire time you've been making shit up and ignoring obvious facts to the point where I can't actually tell if you're serious or trolling. Either you're the dumbest mf alive or 15 years old lmao god damn nephew"
Holiday wasn‚Äôt aggressive at all and I didn‚Äôt see him  drawing any fouls. Lopez got schemed  off the floor and the Bucks had to end the game with Bobby Portis.  Giannis‚Äôs 20 points in 35 minutes is a far cry from the 28 points in 33 minutes he averaged in the regular season. Even if you were to control for it being the postseason that‚Äôs still well below what he normally produces. The 17 rebounds is irrelevant because the Bucks need his scoring more. They can‚Äôt rely on Holiday and Middleton. If you don‚Äôt believe that Jar Crowder affects Giannis go check his stats in the series against the Heat last year.   I didn‚Äôt get upvotes because snowflakes you get triggered when the truth gets told. You guys are going to lose in 5 if the Suns stay healthy and I‚Äôm gonna come back and link the post to you again
Can someone explain why Bobby Portis hasn‚Äôt played the last two games he was playin be great
soooooo where's Bobby Portis
"Bobby portis, are you in this thread? Where are you?"
MISSING: Bobby Portis
Bobby Portis not being able to get on the court is so weird to me.
What happened to Bobby Portis rotation minutes
Someone wanna put Bobby Portis eyes on Costanza face so I can reply to this properly?
If Bobby Portis drops 50 I can‚Äôt even be mad. The man looks like an actor playing a basketball player
Them Bobby Portis eyes
Bucks have the best two players in the series which gives them a serious advantage. Problem is they‚Äôve gotten nothing from their role players (maybe except for Bobby Portis) and Hawks role players have been much more dependable. All that into play I give Milwaukee a slight edge assuming we‚Äôll get at least one big Forbes or Lopez game
"I was worried we would have to wait until someone from another team joined the Knicks in the seasons after this but obviously the stars have aligned and the NBA gods want this streak to never end.   IT LIVES!!!  Big shoutout to Langston Galloway and either Bobby Portis or Danilo Gallinari. Little do they know they are contributing to NBA history.   Let this be a lesson to everybody out there, the decisions you make now could help shape the future in some obscure way, shape or form."
Bobby Portis legacy game
Bobby ‚Äúkeep him away from Mirotic‚Äù Portis
That's OG Bobby Portis
The disrespect to Pat and Bobby Portis smh
Yeah. He cheated on a test and went to Europe to play pro after his sophomore year. He was SEC  Freshman of the Year and would have had a big junior year too. And Arkansas fans don‚Äôt really fawn over Beverly. Bobby Portis‚Ä¶ Daniel Gafford‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll bring those guys up all the time. Rarely do you hear Arkansas fans bringing up Beverly. If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúblue collar‚Äù type of player and you aren‚Äôt really loved by the blue collar program you played at‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty telling.
Milwaukee got Thanasis and Bobby Portis  And Hawks got Gallo  The tradition still continues
Bobby Portis is going to use this as fuel and drop thirty in the next two games
Honestly I‚Äôve been an avid nba fan since ~2016 but after watching the bucks lose last night to a bunch of who‚Äôs I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever watch another nba game again. Not guarding the outside whatsoever letting MFs shoot the 3ball like it‚Äôs a blacktop game when it‚Äôs the most important game in the series and yours to win.. giannis just stood there multiple times with guys driving in the paint shooting in his face. Bobby Portis missing 3-4 3 pointers that were essentially practice shots he was so open.. Middleton and holiday bricking every single shot.. that was the single handed worst basketball game I‚Äôve ever seen and it‚Äôs shady as fuck
"Because he‚Äôs intentionally underselling the quality of these matchups. Trae and Giannis are the best players in the series no doubt but you don‚Äôt have to pretend that the top matchup in the series now involves a guy who contemplated retiring three months ago. That‚Äôs a disingenuous, bad faith way to argue. It‚Äôs like saying that the Bucks‚Äô best player now is Bobby Portis"
"Bobby Portis is a sliver below the rest of the guys you mentioned, so yeah I guess so."
Some good ones. Giannis should be surrounded by them. How many times do they have to kick it out to an open Bobby Portis or PJ Tucker. Those guys can make it but I wouldn‚Äôt say they are good.
"Bud should be fired for the way he runs an offense and not making adjustments. Giannis demands 2-3 guys in the paint and he still can run sets that get guys open shots. Also, he does not make adjustments from game to game, if Trae young or Lou Williams is out there they won‚Äôt run action to the weakest defender. I‚Äôve heard them say bucks just stick to the way they play.   That being said, whoever built this roster is part of the  blame. How do you not have shooters around Giannis?  Jrue is average at shooting, Khris is good but not great, then Giannis is kicking it out to Bobby Portis and Lopez for open 3s. Also they want you to think Forbes is some great 3 pt specialist and he‚Äôs not. Bucks depth and bench are garbage."
Bobby Portis
You gonna see real bobby portis now
"Came here to say this. Very common to walk around with no pain after an ACL. With that being said, it‚Äôs pretty clear the injury was significant. Hawks fan and I hate it for him. Injuries literally ravaging these playoffs. I hope he‚Äôs ok, dude is literally a monster and I love seeing our guys going against him. Fuck Bobby portis though. Fucking douche."
Bobby portis came ready to play in the 4th
Bobby Portis is very stupid
Is it just me or has Bobby Portis managed to get his crazy eyes a bit under control
Bobby Portis got crazy eyes
I heard Bobby Portis has a mean right hook
Bobby Portis got crackhead eyes
"When I think, ‚ÄúI want to watch a bunch of the best players go at each other‚Äôs throats for a title,‚Äù I often  think of Bobby Portis vs Danilo Gallinari."
Does Bobby Portis have anger problems? Those eyes are scary.
Bobby Portis looks like Slim Shady
"Bobby Portis was going to hit him harder, but he realized that wasn't Mirotic, so he held back."
Bobby Portis is 100% the kind of guy who thinks hes can beat up MMA fighters because he knocked out a couple guys on his team or at a bar in his life. I get irrationally annoyed by these kind of dudes
Bobby Portis looks like a Wii Mii come to life.
Middleton trying to make sure dude is good while Bobby Portis acting like he‚Äôs tuff
Bobby Portis' eyes are scared of the back of his head
Good ole crazy eyes bobby portis
Man Bobby Portis should be out there at all times
The Bobby portis game
"I had Jerami Grant there before, but took him out when because I already had Malcolm Brogdon and Lonzo.   Dragic is a fine point guard imo unless he fell off a cliff and I didn‚Äôt notice.  Caris Levert is a great offensive player and is solid on defense.  Bobby portis was just there for spacing and defense, but I‚Äôd probably have Jerami Grant there instead.   Turner is there for his elite rim protection that would allow the rest of the team to be aggressive on defense. After watching how bad the Pacers were without him, it made me realize how much he elevates a defense.   I think it would make the playoffs, but I understand if you think it couldn‚Äôt. I disagree that BI couldn‚Äôt be the best player on a playoff team though."
"The defense is bad, I don‚Äôt trust them to score well enough, I don‚Äôt think Ingram can carry the offensive load of a team with those bigs, Bobby Portis isn‚Äôt starter quality. The team lacks rebounding."
Ingram can easily be a number 1 on a playoff team. I‚Äôll make one like you did.  PG: Malcolm Bronson  SG: Lonzo Ball  SF: Brandon Ingram  PF: Bobby Portis  C: Myles Turner
"The thing that he's truly bad at is scoring. However, he's great at defense, BBIQ, passing, screen setting. What's a big for $5m who is good at ALL of those things AND scoring?  Let's also look at backup bigs in the playoffs who are good at scoring but bad at defense. Montrezl? Kanter? Bobby Portis? How are they doing in the playoffs this year? They haven't played many minutes, as they're being schemed out. For backup bigs in the playoffs, the scoring has to heavily outweigh a lack of defense, which it hasn't really been so far.  Teams need their backup bigs to not be a liability - and Looney is very much not one. That's valuable."
Bobby Portis is also underpaid this season because he wanted to play here
only guy I would get Bobby Portis mixed up with is Eminem when he does his bulgy eyes
the best is when Giannis does something no other player can do.. Like 2 steps from the 3 point line and dunks and Marv thinks he Bobby Portis...
Bobby Portis is getting the BAE this year at like $3 million and is a huge piece in the ECF for us.
"Bobby Portis has definitely has a crazy career so far, and I'm glad he seems to have found a role in Milwaukee. And for only 3 and a half million he's an excellent addition, and was a huge factor against the Hawks yesterday"
Bobby Portis and Reggie Jackson.   But I will say that Julius randle outplayed his contract.
"Yeah, I got a 3 day ban, because there's a lonely Raptors fan who saved comments from Bucks fans dating back to the off-season, just to try to shit-talk us when we were down.  (Who knows, you might have been one of them too.)  He saved me because I replied to one of his trolling comments in a post about Bobby Portis reacting to memes about himself made by Bucks fans, from over four months ago.  His problem is, he kept talking shit too early.  Talked shit when the Nets went up 2-0, then came back again when the Hawks won Game 1.  I got banned for making fun of him with swear words and saying he kept blowing his load too early.   Even with all that, the funniest part might be that he tried to deny that he saved our comments, even though he was talking his trash in 4-8 month old posts.  So if he was telling the truth about not saving our comments, that meant he would have had to scroll through 8 months of his own comment history (with him posting about as much as this Harden troll) to find the people he wanted to talk shit to.  Which is far more pathetic than saving our comments, considering the amount of time and effort it would take, instead of just shit-talking us in the post-game threads like normal trolls.  Can't imagine how sad your life must be to devote that much time to hating a sports team."
"Forbes has a player option (and may have played himself into a little bit more money).  Tucker is UFA, but should probably be easy to keep unless somebody gives him way too much money...the Bucks have his bird rights, so they can keep him if he wants to stay.   The trouble is they're going to lose Portis, who will definitely decline his player option and get far more than they can pay him as a non-Bird FA.  They could give him the mini-MLE, but that would be it for them.    They really need to just find this summer's Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes.  There isn't a combination of assets outside their Big 3 that can net them anything great."
I WANT   IGUO... BOBBY PORTIS
Nope. The guy probably has to be coming off the bench‚Ä¶kinda like Bobby Portis
"its not wide open, brook blocked a few of them in game 2  and running portis instead and going small has its own risks, because portis does a much worse job defending trae on the perimeter than their big lineup does.   that shimmy 3 trae did in game 1 came off bobby portis messing up the switch and ending up in totally the wrong position  and also, if trae is gonna heat up with his floater then budenholzer showed he's willing to bring in the smallball portis lineup anyway, brook barely played in the 2nd half of game 3.   but if trae is cold from midrange then they are probably better off running lopez.  especially with the spacing he gives them"
Game 3 I noticed that the wall got tighter. Also coach Bud. To be honest I prefer having Bobby Portis in more than Brook in terms of speed and agility. Keep Brook rested and rotate him like in Game 2.
"Bobby Portis had a great game here, Just instant offense."
He adjusted today. You nephews just can‚Äôt see it.   Bobby Portis got more minutes. He only went 7 deep (Bryn only played 7 minutes so really 6 deep). Giannis played 41 minutes. Jrue/Khris played 42.
"Give me Trae shimmying, Bobby Portis having crazy eyes, Connaughton losing his mind after a decent play, Hawks fans counting down 10 secs, Thannasis coming in for some bully ball, overreactions from both teams after a W. The NBA is suppose to be fun."
Giannis was the only decent Bucks player not name Bobby Portis for 3 quarters.  He kept us in it.
"All hail Bobby Portis, the Killer Eye."
"shoutouts Bobby Portis. Made everyone of his minutes count, was majorly influential in this game"
Bobby portis pleaseee introduce Giannis to Lethal shooter
"Brook ""what's a pick &amp; roll"" lopez: -17  Bobby portis: +17  Someone tell bud"
Every game I've watched Bobby Portis is doing exactly what you want a guy coming off the bench to do in the playoffs. He's been so crucial for the Bucks.

I cant believe Bobby f\*\*\*in Portis got a ring. As a bulls fan im both happy and shocked.
CP3 doesn't like Scott Foster? Or what's the context here? Must have missed something.  Also saw Bobby Portis blocking CP3 from taking word with Scott Foster end of game 6. That related?
I‚Äôm so happy for Bobby Portis
"That was the shit of legends from Giannis. A fitting stamp on what was a great Finals performance throughout. Big shots from Khris and even though Jrue shot like shit, still did his thing defensively. Oh and fuck our management for getting rid of Bobby ""big shot"" Portis."
"Personally I‚Äôd say Bobby Portis is pretty unlikeable, but I don‚Äôt know if many people remember the Mirotic incident"

Pretty weird you don‚Äôt have Bobby portis on this list
bobby portis better up his twitter game soon then
I mean no one on that Warriors team better than Bobby Portis so....
"If i was a college coach, i'd start recruiting from the Yoruba tribe   Tbh, this Bucks 2021 title feels a lot like the first Rockets title, Hakeem being the sole super star of the team.   Bobby Portis is the Vernon Maxwell of the team"
Legendary game from Giannis! So glad the Bucks won.  That Bobby Portis screen on CP3 made my night lmao
"Montie Williams is a nice developmental coach, but it's time for the Suns to hire an executional coach who can try to take them to the summit.  How you can let Giannis play one-on-one and rack up 50 points is beyond me.  Yes, Giannis is a great talent . . . Which is why you double team him and see if the rest of the Bucks can scrape together 100 points.  Would much rather watch Bobby Portis take 15 wide open 3s than watch Giannis dunk 15 times and go to a free throw line another 15.  For fuck's sake, Frank Kaminsy was guarding Giannis one-one-one for the first 6 mins of the 4th quarter.  I'm honestly shocked, and yes I'm asserting that I might know more about the X's and O's of basketball than Montie Williams does."
He still has Bobby Portis in front of him but he‚Äôs close
Bobby Portis got dat Gowron energy
Or vote Bobby Portis for Finals MVP
imagine making a meme to which bobby portis said 'oh this one hard' i think id die happy
1. Giannis  2. Middleton  3. Bobby Portis  4. Brandon Jennings  5. Bobby Portis
"She was amazing, especially since she had a good question for Bobby Portis which you know was not prepared. Lol"
CP3 has never been on a dominant team either. He always seems to be on a team with one or two pieces missing. Suns needed a Bobby Portis guy or a secondary big man who can play physically.
we just watched a playoffs with brook lopez and bobby portis getting major minutes in every series. Shaq woulda been fine.
The Bobby Portis stares into your soul as he skips downcourt game
Trade everything for Bobby Portis
yup  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/before-games-bobby-portis-pictures-opponents-slapping-his-mom/
Bobby Portis and Thanasis bout to slide into Kendall's DM lol
"He won't get it and knows it. Now he needs to do what every player does to get their stock back up. Play on a team where you receive very little attention and can put up great numbers.   Bobby Portis did it this off season and it worked out perfectly obviously. Oladipo playing with Giannis, Middleton and Jrue will get him the most open looks he's ever had in his career."
&gt;So in conclusion Bobby Portis is the greatest player is NBA history   As well as the best boxer.
I wonder how much Nikola Mirotic's teammates in the NBA liked him. They didn't seem too upset at Bobby Portis for punching Mirotic. Made me wonder if maybe Mirotic was being a jerk and Bobby was just the first Bulls player to reach his breaking point.
&gt;Bobby portis must be a GOD  Well... you aren't wrong.
"Once again, and I really can't stress this enough, but: you can agree or disagree with the way the rules are set up, but there is no question about the way they are set up. Bobby portis knew that"
Giannis isn‚Äôt good enough to be the best player on a championship team. Khris isnt good enough to be a number two on a championship team. Bud is a Garbage coach‚Ä¶ damn. Bobby portis must be a GOD
"Absolutely, he was at times the only thing that had working. He damn near had half the teams total points and did so insanely efficiently on a night where everyone except Bobby Portis was unimpressive on the offensive side."
the Bobby Portis game will be remembered by knicks fans forever
"Look, no one likes billionaires but nothing was sucking the air out of that arena. They were chanting for Bobby Portis for crying out loud"
"Bulls fan here. I feel very happy for Bobby Portis. Bucks fans, glad you got Crazy Eyes.   2016 NBA Summer League Champions with the Chicago Bulls, Bobby 'Crazy Eyes' Portis got himself the big one: an NBA Championship with the Milwaukee Bucks.   The long awaited championship Giannis has arrived and he damned well deserved it."
"My gut is telling me that a 37 year old lebron and a torn acl Kawhi aren‚Äôt going to be top 5 players next season, but at the same time it‚Äôd be disrespectful to replace them with someone like Jokic or Doncic which comparatively has done much less. So in conclusion Bobby Portis is the greatest player is NBA history"
The disrespect to Bobby Portis‚Ä¶
He already has superstar Bobby Portis
And Bobby Portis
"So what you‚Äôre saying is, I‚Äôm Bobby Portis Jr.   Sweet."
"That‚Äôs [Once a Knick, Always a Knick‚Ñ¢](https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/Mq2jNO_VhdFkhO9MHjtgH9lNbUY=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2GI66P5YGFGK7CSN3CXOWLYSVQ.jpg) Bobby Portis"

BOBBY FUCKING PORTIS
&gt;  CP3 missing that technical FT (94% FT shooter reg season) after Portis high-stepping is pure justice  Fuck I missed that. I was so angry I was doing a bobby walk threw my apartment.
This is amazing for the city.   We are all Bobby Portis tonight.
You spelled Bobby Portis wrong.
All you need to win is Bobby Portis on the court
"Don‚Äôt forget Bobby Portis. He had a big one tonight, too."
"Yeah but it‚Äôs a good way to give the players a chance to speak to the crowd.    The way the crowd chanted for all 4 players interviews, and when Jrue lead the Bobby Portis chant. Those moments are amazing and worth the narrative questions imo.   She didn‚Äôt go out of line and make it too much about anything else, and I think Giannis liked the brother question."
"As a Bulls fan, I'm glad Bobby Portis got a ring before Cam Payne did. Also, something about Jae Crowder's attitude makes him hard to root for.    That being said, as a Chicago Bears fan, I promised myself to never be happy for a team from Wisconsin.   This Finals never happened"
"As a huge fan of Arkansas legend Bobby Portis, I hope he stays his entire career!"
That Bobby Portis question she asked was 100% spurt of the moment right? Ain‚Äôt a shot in the world they had an interview with Bobby Portis to close it out in mind. She did good
"I didn‚Äôt hate the Suns until they got Paul. Happy they don‚Äôt get a ring. If they played without CP3, I might‚Äôve root for them.  Booker had some rough moments, but he will get better.   Ayton, I don‚Äôt know what happened to him. I don‚Äôt know why they stopped going to him. Series changed after he got in foul trouble in Game 3, and he was dominating that game until the foul trouble.  As for the Bucks, thank God you guys won the title. You guys increased everyone‚Äôs blood pressure to heart attack range.   Jrue was bad offensively most of the series, but just being a good defensive threat and being 100 times better than Bledsoe really changed this team. They 100% lose to Brooklyn with Bledsoe, even with Kyrie out and Harden not at 100%.  Middleton also had games that made me want to chug alcohol, and I‚Äôm an anti-drinker. But good for him to be there when the Bucks needed him.  Giannis, nothing more to be said. Except man, just develop a 3-ball this offseason.  Pat, you deserve a shout out this Finals. You didn‚Äôt always have a lot of rebounds, but you always went after the rebounds the hardest.  And Bobby Portis, your energy was huge.  I feel bad for Lopez and Tucker, because I don‚Äôt have a lot to say, but at least for Lopez, I don‚Äôt, in my opinion, felt he was awful."
"God bless Bobby Portis, so say we all."
"Put some respek on the name! Bobby ""NBA CHAMPION QWOP"" PORTIS"
Bobby Portis is Pat Bev's doppelganger if he wasn't a huge asshole
I just seen kendall and bobby portis exchanging instas

bobby portis jr
OG BOBBY PORTIS
Bobby Portis just defended and locked Trae Young one on one
Bobby helping Trae up after that foul earlier.   Portis is an example of how you can play hard and with an edge and not be a total dickhole like PatBev.
"Oh, I see the Bucks have the Bobby Portis God Card activated and Lopez is possessed by the spirit of Hakeem Olajuwon tonight. Nice."
The Hawks have come back from worse   But really.. Bobby Portis?
The drop-off from Giannis to Bobby Portis is laughably small.
I feel like boo‚Äôing Bobby Portis isn‚Äôt a good idea lol
"Bobby Portis is the future, we all see it"
Why are the Hawks cheering Bobby Portis so strangely?
I am here for history. This will be known as the Bobby Portis Superstar Game.
"""I'm very crazy,"" Portis said. ""I play angry. I play mad. I play very angry because every game, I sit in the locker room and I envision that the other player on the team slapped my mom. That's why I get mad, and now I've gotta get you because you slapped my mom.""  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/before-games-bobby-portis-pictures-opponents-slapping-his-mom/"
Chuck: Bobby Portis is probably the only player they got that's a killer...  Camera Man moves to Bobby Portis: ...  Bobby Portis: Craziest eyes i've ever seen  LOL
Bobby Portis could've been a character on Daria.
" They‚Äôre called stars for a reason. They‚Äôre the best at what they do.   Giannis is better than Bobby Portis.   Trae Young is better than Lou Williams.   So naturally, people will tune out more if the best players aren‚Äôt involved.   So please spare me this ‚Äúyou only care about stars‚Äù self-righteous crap."
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that‚Äôs also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
"Did you not find game 5 entertaining? Bucks played great team ball. Middleton and Holiday showed they could lead the team, Brooke put on a clinic and had a pretty crazy dunk via a Holiday oop, Bobby Portis stepped up and brought a ton of energy.  Or does that stuff not matter because no one named Giannis or Trae played? It was great basketball but I'm guess you and a lot of NBA fans didn't care cause the names you wanted to see weren't there."
He also pictures his opponent slapping his mother to get going.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/before-games-bobby-portis-pictures-opponents-slapping-his-mom/
"After. And people forget that the team was just as mad at Nikola for that altercation. It sounded like he got up in Bobby's face and Bobby don't take no shit.  &gt;[The altercation began with pushing and shoving between the two before Mirotic lunged forward at Portis and Portis hit Mirotic, sending him to the floor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen worse,‚Äù a witness said.](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bobby-portis-punches-nikola-mirotic-breaking-bones-mirotics-face)  --  &gt;[The feeling is Portis has done his part to repair things, and the reality of the situation is Portis is looked at by teammates as a guy that has put in all the work this summer, is a better teammate, and is just more liked.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/bulls-players-reportedly-side-with-bobby-portis-over-nikola-mirotic-after-incident/)"
"Bobby Portis for example, before his contract was up we reportedly tried to extend him ""for a multi-year deal worth 40-50 million"" but he turned it down. At the time we had just drafted Lauri Markkanen and didn't want to spend any more money than that at the power forward position so we ended up trading him before he walked for nothing.  So it's not like he wasn't good enough for us to offer him a second contract, they just couldn't agree on the money."
I'm rooting for Crazy Eyes man. That time when he was laughing at all the Bobby Portis memes-- seems like a cool guy. Maybe Mirotic was just a douche
"Bobby ""stares motherfuckerly "" Portis"
I'd propably love Portis if that teammate was anyone but my boi Mirotic. Garnett is my favorite player of all time and I can see the same passion and spirit.  But fuck you Bobby
Bobby 'Get Out' Portis
"For these playoffs he's starting as a SG. Next to Jrue, Tucker, Giannis, and Brook. He's a SG. It's just about if those are the majority of his minutes.   He also started at SG without Giannis as Bobby Portis started.   So while he's a normally a small forward he could technically break the streak."
"We just saw Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne ball out after NBA obscurity. Bobby Portis putting up stats last night. We got no idea what the role players look like next year. I think the warriors are in the same conversation as any non-Net's squad.   Did you write off KD like you're doing Klay? They probably limit him at the start and ramp him up. Maybe he's toast, but I'm not gonna say he can't compete without seeing the man."
Right? Why does everyone think Bobby Portis is some 12 year vet player? Lol.
Man I love to see that.  I am now a Bobby Portis fan :)
Bobby Portis is a national treasure.
Bobby Portis NBA Finals MVP
Bobby Portis = Ratings
Bobby Portis looks like an actor playing an NBA player in a movie
I‚Äôm not sure Bobby portis will let you guys come out flat lol
Bobby Portis is way too low.

I want Bobby Portis to get mad at me next
I love Bobby Portis
"Even as a Kentucky fan, I honestly loved him too. That SEC tourney will always have a special place in my heart and Bobby Portis was a star through the whole thing. Such a stand out dude."
Bobby Portis looks as old as those guys lol.
Bobby Portis a real one
Bobby Portis seems so nice i cant help but think wtf did mirotic say or do that pissed him off so much he broke his nose
I‚Äôm not gonna front that man Bobby Portis scares me
Bobby Portis always seems like he‚Äôs staring down or trying to intimidate his opponent. I‚Äôve seen it a few times this series lol although this is not one of those instances.
If KG is a chaotic evil then Bobby Portis is a chaotic good
"I didn't and I'm not going to watch the video and the reason is I think Bobby portis is a piece of shit not as a ball player but as a human being not just because what happened with the bulls but because during one of the playoff games when a player was falling and he grabbed on to portis his arm so he didn't fall on top of Bobby portis's own teammate portis like the piece of shit that he is jerked his arm away from the guy and he fell rather than helping a fellow NBA player Stop from falling on top of his own teammate he jerked his arm away, so my personal opinion is he's a piece of shit."
But it isn‚Äôt 30 years ago. And 30 years ago Bobby Portis was -4 years old.
"Bobby ""Andrew Luck"" Portis"
Bobby Portis must have envisioned mirotic slapping his mom
"Bobby ""Boucher"" Portis"
Bobby Portis looks like that washed up uncle who swears he coulda made the league‚Ä¶except he actually did make the league
"Plus it's mostly harmless cuz most guys in the league will never actually fight. Bobby Portis is an exception though, he's got crazy eyes and broke his own teammate's face so you gotta tread carefully."
"Story that I saw when I googled it said Mirotic ""charged at Portis twice"" before Portis swung on him.  Don't know if that means he was doing the KG sort of  ""I'm going to fight this guy (hold me back so we don't actually fight)"" thing or what, but seems like plenty of people there thought Mirotic was the asshole.  Bobby just took it to the next level.  And then Mirotic was the one the Bulls dumped at the next opportunity, even though he looked very promising at the time.  Another hint that Portis probably wasn't all that out of line."
Allowing fights is a terrible idea. These are massive human beings and they're not wearing equipment like other sports. Look at what Bobby Portis did to Mirotic or Kermit Washington punching Rudy T.
Bobby Portis looks like one of the veggie tales vegetables.
Don't tell me you dont see Bobby Portis and think Graves Disease lmao
Bobby Portis has the eyes of a buck
Bobby Portis is turning out to be the right kind of crazy and I love it
"I‚Äôm cool with trying to compete and not just relying on picks and the lottery but I also question if a borderline all star (barely top 30) good center who has some struggles defensively is worth an ok prospect and two firsts one of which is top 10. But we‚Äôve done what we‚Äôve done, so now we need to maximize LaVine and Vucevic and hope Patrick Williams is as good as advertised. We need a new PF, wing depth, and a new PG (Spencer Dinwiddie, Furkan Korkmaz, Bobby Portis is the dream but we probably can‚Äôt afford all of them unless we trade Thaddeus for a first, and find a way to dump Satoransky and Aminu)"
I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt say Bobby Portis also‚Ä¶
"I can't even tell you how proud I am of Bobby Portis right now, FUCK MAN.  I miss him so much, I always believed and to see him doing this on the big stage is so fucking amazing."
He got outplayed by Bobby Portis
"&gt;I sit in the locker room and I envision that the other player on the team slapped my mom  Bobby ""Boucher"" Portis"
"This was asked yesterday, and I would to nominate Bobby Portis as LEAST sweaty player in the league."
"Bobby Portis' facial hair screams ""I eat ass"""
PJ tucker and bobby portis are the kinds of guys you want to go to war with
"Marc Albert is such a gem.  Thanasis checks in for the Bucks for Bobby Portis, Marv: 'Thanasis Antetokounmpo checking in for Solomon Hill' - Hill plays for the Hawks...  Capella gets a blocking foul called on Connaughton, Marv: 'Blocking foul on Lopez'....  Never stop Marv, WE LOVE YOU!!!!"
"Every time I see Bobby Portis, all I can think of is the Dave Chapelle Rick James skit when Charlie Murphy was like:   ‚Äúone eye was looking at me, and the other eye was looking at Rick‚Äù"

Got that with him OR Bobby Portis
i won‚Äôt be surprised if the hawks win another game but damn that was a beatdown. bucks defense was flying all over the court and brook finally didn‚Äôt get cooked all game by the PNR with trae and collins. and bobby portis needs to keep getting minutes off the bench cause he‚Äôs giving the bucks great energy and another big who can stretch the floor when giannis is in. don‚Äôt want to say it‚Äôs over but the bucks may take this game and run away with it
I put $100 on a Trae double double and hawks to win. I‚Äôve never been so defeated this early in a game before.   I hate Bobby Portis.
Bobby Portis happened
"I mean. Listen, when we‚Äôre in close games and PJ is 0-4 in 34 minutes I‚Äôm pretty mad about it, especially that Game 5 against Brooklyn because he wasn‚Äôt doing a lot on defense either.    But‚Ä¶. He is one of the biggest differences for the Bucks this season. PJ, Bobby Portis, and Jrue Holiday."
Bobby Portis eyes are enough to win the Finals MVP.
Im convinced that Bobby Portis is a KG clone that went rogue
You know the game was bad when the clip request is for Bobby Portis mic'd up.

Bobby Portis bailing the Hawks defense out.
"jrue seemed fine with it, portis was the one who fucked up the switch and jrue had just scored right before that shot. he was carrying a heavy offensive load during that game  definitely a dangit bobby moment, jrue switched immediately instead of fighting through the screen and you can see bobby realize 2 seconds later oh shit I'm supposed to be guarding trae"
"Last time carrying was called was Giannis against the Nets, last time three in the key was called was game 1 on Bobby Portis, and the last time a 10 second violation was called, it was on Giannis against the Nets. It would be nice to see random enforcement called against our opponents occasionally, but then again, it wouldn't because they'd be whining just like me and I can't stand people like that."
"Was called just last bucks game on Bobby Portis(?), I thought I was seeing things  The refs were really good that game tho"
"I don't think it's the only consideration. You compared their +/- and their 3%, do you think Bobby Portis is better than Durant?"
"Are you serious? It was a middleton iso off the inbound, what the fuck else is supposed to happen besides generate an open 3? My problem is Pat is not a good 3 point shooter this game or in these playoffs so him standing in the longest 3 point spot as the release for the middleton iso was a bad decision. He did nothing else that play except stand there waiting for the ball. It would have been better to have Brynn Forbes or Bobby Portis out there as they have actually shot better in these playoffs.
