"Pop and Buford been doing weird things since Duncan retired.  Like giving a 36yo Pau Gasol a 3 year 45 million contract.  If any year is the year to tank, this gotta be it with Cade, Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Zaire coming in the draft. Move LMA and maybe even DD to a contender for picks or some young pieces."
" Might as well join the FadeForCade Sweepstakes. Lots of talent in the 21 Draft, Evan Mobley, although the Mavs could use a pure scorer too like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams or Jalen Johnson.  Would bubble playoff teams rather have a Top 7 pick in this year's draft?"
Pleasant: Jalen Brunson being back with 50/40/90 shooting splits  Unpleasant: James Johnson and Trey Burke playing 3rd and 4th most minutes because all of our starters got covid.

"THJ, James Johnson, Burke, Jalen Brunson. All have played that role this season or last; when you have that depth, you don't have to overplay your best player in the regular season (that doesn't help either)"
"We are have been missing our 2nd-6th best players for almost half the season, as a result we've had to start 3rd stringers, rookies and G-league players, who are shooting at a historically low % from 3. Defenders do not respect our 3PT shooters so they clog the paint and leave guys like Wes Iwundu wide open for 3. (He's shooting 14% on the year). This means Luka isn't able to drive into the paint, and has to take mid range shots and 3s. His 3s are not good, but a lot of it stems from defenders not having to guard 3 of our starters (WCS, Iwundu and Green) and instead double or triple teaming Luka at all times.   The below players are our primary rotation guys from the past few weeks. Just absolutely awful.   WCS was let go from the Sacramento Kings, he's garbage. He is like 9/14 on dunks this season and a washed DeMarcus Cousins lit him up for 28/17/5. WCS is a -30 in his last 7 games.  Wes Iwundu is shooting 14.3% from 3 and 31.7% from the field. He is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever.  Josh Green is shooting 9% from 3. Green and Iwundu are posting 89 and 90 ORTG and 112 and 113 DRTG.  Boban is 7'4 and has not recorded a single block in 100 minutes of play. He is a nonexistent rim protector, cannot space the floor, cannot guard the perimeter and is slow. He's efficient in the low post and has good hands, that's about it.  THJ has been solid but wildly inconsistent. He's averaging 17.5 PPG on 38% from 3. His defense is below average, and he will have a 30 point game then proceed to shoot 0-12 and have 0 points like he did in Toronto. THJ has had 8 games shooting 38% or lower from the field (4 games of 0-30%), and then 4 games shooting 60-78% from the field.  Jalen Brunson has been great for us but he missed a lot of games. He's probably been our 2nd or 3rd best player as of late, despite only averaging 12 ppg and 3.5 apg.  Porziņģis missed 10 games so far, and is shaking off rust. He's averaging 19 ppg 47/29.5/82 shooting. His defense has been very poor and he's been a negative on court through 7 games.  James Johnson is nothing more than a back up big, he's shooting 3s at 31%, his defense is average and he makes some bad decisions.  That's our current rotation.  Luka, 1-3 average level starters (Porziņģis is a fringe all star usually, but has not been thus far in the season), and then a bunch of end of bench guys and rookies."
"That 2021 Draft is gonna be one of the most loaded in recent memory.  Cade, Mobley, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Scottie Barnes, Kuminga. Jalen Johnson."
You guys need to fade for Kuminga or Jalen Johnson. Garland/Sexgod/Osman/Kuminga/Allen could be a great lineup.  Teams who are rebuilding always seme to try to compete a year too early. Hawks should tank another year. Pelicans need a good guard. Etc.
"yah if wolves get a top 3 pick, then dubs get twolves 2022 pick unprotected. so in that case the hope would be the twolves suck again in 2022, but kat, dlo, ant-man (assuming he figures it out), and cade might make for a pretty good team. if wolves miss out, then dubs are getting a 4th-10th pick depending on how well the wolves do. someone like jalen johnson or scottie barnes maybe?"
i don't think so   starting jalen fucks up the second unit and forces guys like james johnson  to do things they shouldn't be doing

1. Booker 2. Ayton 3. Bridges 4. Cam Johnson 5. CP3 6. Dario 7. Jalen Smith  Though 7 could also be Jevon Carter. I'd be bummed to lose Crowder in this scenario though
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
Jalen Johnson doesn't look too good
"You can’t go wrong with top 7 IMO. I’d take each of them over any of the top prospects in 2020.  Cade, jalen Suggs, jalen green, jalen Johnson, kuminga, mobley, Scottie barnes."

"Crowder is nice, hes a good 3&amp;D wing and gets along good with CP3. Probably wise to start him this year while integrating Johnson more. Hows Jalen Smith? This pick kind of confused me since Cam Johnson looked good in the bubble."
"Absolutely not. He’s not even Top 5 tbh.  First up, using per-36 in an argument for a guy who isn’t averaging anywhere close to it is kinda silly. Jalen Leque is the per-36 lol king in the NBA right now, averaging 29 pts 29 reb and 10 asts on 50% FG. How many of you even know which team he’s from? Means nothing.  Now coming to who is actually likely to win it - here are my top 5: 1. Christian Wood 2. Michael Porter Jr. - Grand Canyon sized gap - 3. Jeremi Grant 4. Keldon Johnson 5. Mikal Bridges/Mike Conley  Honestly, it’s really just between Christian Wood and Michael Porter Jr. right now."
"Just off the top of my head Wood, Jalen Brown and Sexton are probably turning out to be the best value picks in fantasy right now. Keldon Johnson maybe the best for a guy absolutely zero people drafted."
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
"Jalen Smith at 10 in last year draft is actually not that big of a reach, he could be a project player that takes a couple years to develop whereas Cam Johnson is older than Devin Booker and got drafted at 11.  Speaking of which, has Jalen Smith gotten any minute?"
"Luka KP Jalen Brunson Tim Hardaway JR  Maxi Kleber Dorian Finny Smith Willie Cauley Stein Trey Burke  Tough leaving Boban off the list, but these are definitely the 8 most important Mavs. Not sure anyone from our team would be taken tbh. Richardson, James Johnson, Powell, and Iwundu have been underwhelming and we haven't seen much of anything from our rookies yet"
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"I like some of the mid first round projected talent or even hard to project picks just as much or more as the top projected picks   Jalen Johnson, Isaiah Todd, Franz Wagner, Sengun, Brown I like a lot"

"Bridges was a great pick, some people were even surprised he fell to 10.  Cam Johnson was def called a reach by all people. Very savvy move by the Suns.  The Jalen pick should be viewed after 2 years (as most picks should). But people should be fine for having doubts and a bit of disappointment.  In my case, I view the pick as more of a doubt on Ayton than an oversight on Haliburton, Vassell, and others."
"He likes dudes who played like him. Tall, lanky and good shooting form. Cam Johnson and Jalen Smith fit that profile. Haliburton, while tall for his position, isn't exactly big and has a funky shooting form."

"Spurs best suited to trade LMA to a contender and go all-in on the youth and rebuild movement. Get another lottery piece to go along with White-Dejounte-Lonnie-Devin-Keldon. Maybe a Jalen Green if lucky, Jalen Suggs, Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, or Zaire Williams.  Mavs need to get healthy and stay healthy, but they may still be missing a piece or two.  Rockets - very impressive post-Harden era and they haven't fully gelled yet. Wall-Dipo-Gordon-Woods-Tucker-Cousins-House-Nwaba is a solid rotation."
"As a Suns fan who is loving having Chris Paul on his team, I would say that the Suns record from the 2019-2020 season is worse than that team actually was. Injuries/suspensions to Ayton, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio, Booker and others forced Monty to play absolutely terrible bench lineups. I can still vividly remember the 3 pg lineups of: Elie Okobo, Ty Jerome, Jevon Carter, Oubre and Frank. This led to the Suns being worse than the actually were. You may wonder why the Suns played so well in the bubble, well besides major growth from M. Bridges and C. Johnson and the addition of Cam Payne, finally having a completely healthy roster (with the exception of Oubre) allowed this team to play up to its potential.   Also, James Jones had a great offseason - getting rid of Oubre, Okobo, Baynes, and Jerome while adding Crowder, Galloway, Moore, and Nader. Then he added Craig midseason this year and he's been great. The Suns still remain weak in their big man depth (an injury to Ayton or Saric is my number one fear as a Suns fan right now). But the improved depth of this team is tremendous. Everyone on the team belongs on an NBA roster (well, Jalen Smith is TBD there) which is something you couldn't say about most Suns players for the past 5 years.   Point being, while the Chris Paul addition has been big, I think that health and improved depth have been just as consequential, if not more so. In the case of the Suns, it is a massive over simplification to attribute all their improvement to CP3, and it takes away from the work our GM, coaching staff, trainers, and players have put in. I will grant the argument though that without the CP3 trade we don't get Nader, nor do we attract Crowder, Moore, or Galloway.  TLDR: due to multiple injuries at key positions the Suns record last season was worse than the team actually was; thus, using the change in the Suns record from last season to this season as a means for quantifying the impact of Chris Paul on the suns does not paint a completely accurate picture. Improved health and roster depth for the Suns have been just as consequential, if not more so, than the addition of CP3. Without CP3 there is no way this Suns team is a #2 seed in the west, but I believe they'd be sitting in the #5/#6 range if they still had Rubio instead of Paul.   Thank you for reading this rant."
"&gt;	trying to remember the name  Johnson? Springer? Suggs? Green? Shit Masai, which jalen/jaden did we want?"
"He’s on the Spurs; Pop traditionally has rookies on a shorter leash, and they’re stacked at G/F with Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Demar, Keldon Johnson, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay. He’s averaging 17 minutes a game, which isn’t terrible, but it’s the least of any lottery player besides Okongwu, Toppin, Jalen Smith, Kira Lewis, and Nesmith. Those guys suffer the same problem as Vassell- being stuck in the rotation due to roster depth- but I also think they’re significantly worse than Vassell."
"I honestly cannot believe that the trade value wasn’t that high. Like, the Mavs could’ve traded a first round pick and Jalen Brunson, James Johnson and Dwight Powell,"

"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."

He doesn’t play like jordan, he plays like Giannis if Giannis took more threes. He’s definitely gonna make the league. Alex definitely needs to get better but he’ll be scary once pro teams have him in the gym 4 hours a day and he gets stronger. His defense is mega questionable though. Lots of dumb fouls and using his size and athleticism to defend rather than technique. But that’s something he can fix. I can’t speak to his mentality but he did attack a ref after his final game senior year. Take that as you will."
Sengun should not be close to a lottery pick in this next draft. Magic should look at Franz Wagner or Jalen Johnson.

"Suggs too. Along with the guys you mentioned are seen as ""can't miss"" guys. Kuminga has lost a little shine recently, he struggled shooting in the bubble, but he will probably put up a strong showing in pre-draft combine/workouts. I'd be surprised if any of the guys in the Scottie Barnes, Moses Moody, Jalen Johnson tier jumped him."
"Suggs is in play top 5 two, and there are a couple more really good prospects in Jalen Johnson and Scottie Barnes, so things don't hit a sharp drop off until after the top 7 (in my opinion, obviously)."
"Stanley Johnson sucks but he isn't next level, do-everything wrong-and-then-some terrible like Baynes  Edit: This post made me realize that Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels are two different people and some confusion I've had during the season now makes a lot more sense"

"Chuck had a good supporting cast with 7 guys averaging in double figures (KJ, Thunder Dan, Cedric Ceballos, Tom Chambers and Danny Ainge where all all stars at points in their careers... That's 6 out of the top 7 who became all star players vs our 2 in Book and Chris Paul) ...   Kevin Johnson is arguably a better passer than Chris Paul and had an awesome career, Dan Majerle was a great defender (2nd team all defense in 93) but was our best shooter at a high clip at that time (38% on 5.3 attempts); Cedric Ceballos (future all star) had an even higher fg% than Charles at 57.6% that lead the entire league at that time, and he's a small forward, Danny Ainge was still serviceable (played 80 games and hit 40% of his 3s at 4.7 attempts per game) and also averaged double figures; Richard Dumas had a remarkable year as well with 15.8ppg, wc is more than Ayton or Bridges' averages per game, and don't forget about Tom Chambers who was at a decline bit still averaged 12.2 ppg and shooting 39% from 3 while playing 73 games. Mark west and Oliver Miller aren't of the same caliber as Ayton, or even Saric/Kaminsky, but held the middle nicely and passed the ball really well for bigs then, especially Oliver Miller...  I'd argue the 92-93 suns may have the better talent up top, but our 2020-21 suns are better up to the 13th man (still not sold on Jalen Smith tbh).  If you saw that Suns team, they were a joy to watch and also had a strong will to win despite the odds... Chuck was a 6'4""-6'5"" PF for crying out loud, lol... But he dominated on offense and rebounded better than anybody despite his height... That's why they got to the Finals and almost pulled off the championship despite losing the first 2 games at Home... I believed they were a better team than the Bulls, but the Bulls just had the greatest player in the league at that time... Good times :-)  GO SUNS!!!"
Agreed. I think that’s one of the main reasons why Jalen Johnson the forward that was at Duke left early (besides the team being ass). He didn’t get to play in front of the Cameron Crazies which I’m sure was one of the reasons why he even committed there.
"Toronto need a genuine centerpiece to get back up there I think. Lowry, VanVleet, Trent Jr, Anunoby, Siakam, Boucher, Flynn and Birch and then a likely Jalen Johnson pick all seem like the perfect roster to **surround** a superstar with."

"Kuminga. Not sure why Jalen Johnson is sliding in the mocks and he isn't, Johnson played better at Duke than Kuminga did in the G League."
"Jalen Johnson is the biggest mystery of the draft. Raw talent? He's easily Top 10, but leaving Duke early added questions of if he has an ego problem, and we don't know how he's continued to develop since then. He could go as high as #6 if interviews and workouts go well, but if they don't, slipping out of the lottery isn't impossible (OKC would probably take him at 17 at the latest though, kind of fits their shotgun ""swing for the fences"" strategy with all their picks)."
I haven't done research on the prospects but I thought Jalen Johnson and Krispert were top 14 picks.  Funny how Jalen Johnson who some may have as high as 7th falls to Boston at 18th.
"I think the major fall off is after Suggs tbh, he is a solid #4 prospect then there's a drop off.   Kuminga isn't that different from Barnes, Keon Johnson or even Jalen Johnson. They're all athletic wings who can't shoot and don't have a clear path to becoming high-level creators, Kuminga is just the youngest of that group."
"that’s like asking why Jalen Suggs is mocked ahead of Jalen Johnson. Because he’s the better prospect, but things don’t always turn out as predicted"

"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
As per the use.  Whose the Mo Bamba of this draft.  Jalen Johnson?
"NGL, JVG is spitting facts about James Jones and Suns’ recent draft success   Idk about people underrating Bridges, but I definitely questioned them drafting Jalen Smith and Cameron Johnson"
Please no to Jalen Johnson
It has more value because you get the pick of 5he litter. But the anticipated quality of the players is very similar. Jalen Johnson would have been pick 6 at the start of the year but could end up as low as 15 easily.  Pick 8 has never selected an all-star and pick 13 has multiple hall of famers.
jalen johnson or Scottie Barnes
"Man, Jalen Johnson is all over the place in mocks, anywhere from 8th to 25th.  Curious what Cavs fans would think about taking *another* small guard"
"Yea but the Suns picked Cam Johnson the year prior and that worked well so it made sense. Regardless, I’m still hopeful Jalen Smith can improve and make an impact in year 2."
"Barring a direction change based on the new ownership, the team seems to be barreling forward with KAT + Russell as their foundation of the future. That is in part why they took Ant Man #1 over LaMelo--too much overlap between LaMelo and Russell.   With that in mind, the top picks in this draft mostly seem to present the same issue once you add Ant Man to the mix.   With all that said, wouldn't it behoove the Wolves to look at trading back to add some more immediate punch to their team? There's going to be a rebuilding team or two that desperately needs some foundational talent and is going to get unlucky in the lottery, if the Wolves could trade back to 5th-8th they could nab someone like Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, or Corey Kispert that would pair great with the core they already have.  Here's three potential deals I could see  A package involving Al Horford + #5  Larry Nance Jr. + #6  Marvin Bagley  + #7  These all help the Wolves get more veteran help to be more competitive in the next year (when they'll owe their pick unprotected) while still drafting a high level talent that better compliments the core they already have invested in."

"don't have many weakness's. sometimes I guess saric's lack of athleticism sometimes causes us problems defensively when ayton's out vs certain matchups. But even then he wins more matchups than he loses. guess we could use a bit more size but thats why we drafted Jalen smith last year and are developing him.  I guess we have to get a PG who we can develop because PC3 won't be here forever, but he will be here next year.   as long as our young core of Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Johnson keep getting better we good. If kawhi wants to join the team for the MLE I wouldn't say no."
"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
What? That doesn't answer my question. Do you think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs right now? Do you think Alen Smailagic is better than Evan Mobley right now? Paul Reed better than Jalen Johnson? Kyle Guy over Davion Mitchell?
"Jalen Johnson isnt gonna be in the lottery, he’ll go late teens / early twenties. Him being a quitter soured his lottery chances"
"If we get a Top 4 pick, I'd be ecstatic with any of the top 5 players in this draft (Cade/Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga).  If we end up more in the 6-10 range, I like Scottie Barnes, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody or even Jalen Johnson.  I like Kai Jones and Usman Garuba as projects, but I'd only take them if we're trading down into the 11-20 range."
Jalen Johnson is going 15 at the latest. If he was still at Duke he'd be going 6th. As is he is going to fall to like 10-12 most likely. If he falls to us. We aren't passing on him. Unless he really fucks his interviews. He projects to be a Tobias Harris esque player with elite defence and more hops. He's the ultimate boom or bust player in this draft. If he booms he'll be top 10 if not well hell be out the league by year 4.
"Mikal is so dope. I was always a 20 year old raw player &gt; experienced college guy but after seeing how impactful Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson have been from day 1 compared to Jalen Smith, Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender, I’m definitely going to value experience a lot more."
Jalen Rose: Chris Paul is indeed vaccinated.  Jay Williams: Chris Paul walked up to me in the club and whipped out his vaccination cards for both Moderna &amp; Pfizer vaccines. But he also said fuck the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and don’t compare him to Giannis either.
Jalen rose also said CP was vaccinated. Seems like it’s just a case of Johnson and Johnson where you can still show symptoms but they won’t be severe

"8-0 in the bubble. Our team is deep. Any of the players on our team outside of Jalen Smith could get playing time and we'd be fine. Payne,  Craig, Carter, Saric, Johnson, Galloway, Nader, Moore. Depth. Enjoy Space Jam 2."
"Agreed, there are only a handful of a players in every draft that have actual impact on the court for good teams.  Cam Johnson is one of them.  Jalen Smith may never be that guy, but I'm also not going to assume he isn't after his first year in the league."
"You're putting all the emphasis on drafting.  McD had two great drafts.  The rest of everything else he did was fucking garbage.  We had fucking scores of assets with our 3 headed monster and he got nothing in return.  Sure, the Jalen Smith pick looks dubious, however, James Jones picked Cam Johnson (who has been great for us).  He brought in Monty, changed our culture, added all of the pieces around Booker and Ayton.  All of that success led to him trading for CP3.  So, sure, if your entire judgement of a GM is based purely on lottery hits, then you are correct."
Tbh Cam Johnson seems like a solid pick but not a home run pick. He's a good bench shooter who can put up around 9-10ppg but that's probably all he'll ever really be since he's already 25 and hasn't improved much since last season. And James Jones obviously doesn't seem as a long term starter at the 4 if he drafted Jalen Smith to be that guy. PJ Washington would have probably been better. Good shooter like Cam and just has way more all around upside.
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
"Keep: Booker, Ayton, Mikal, Paul, Johnson, Payne, Crowder, Dario.   Dario is debatable. Some people might like Craig, or want to keep Jalen to have some chance at a guy who could blossom.   Craig would get picked up. Someone would take a flyer on Smith most likely. Jevon Carter would be a good presence for a new team as well."
I know this player is random but Jalen Brunson i just lobe the way he plays the game a mid range deadeye who can take it to the rim he finished top 5 in FG% in the paint and he is only 6'0    All time has to be joe johnson
"Suns bench:  Guards - Cam Payne (can start on any team), Etwan Moore (proven vet) Langston Galloway (Microwave scorer from downtown and proven starter), Jevon Carter (best defender among the guards and capable 3pt shooter), Tyshon Alexander (rookie, 3 pt sniper)  Forwards - Cam Johnson (has been a starter as well), Torrey Craig (Proven Vet and rebounder w a sweet 3pt stroke)  PF/C - Dario Saric (proven stretch big), Frank Kaminsky (also proven stretch big) - both of them are capable passers btw ; Jalen Smith (Rookie but can shoot the 3 and block shots/rebound)  Just looking at the Bench, we can field another starting 5 with Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric and still be able to defend and outscore another average NBA starting 5, and have capable backups in Galloway, Jevon Carter, and Frank Kaminsky to run vs other 2nd units...that's a DEEP bench right there...  I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come . Go SUNS!!!!"
"Ideally CP3 opts out for a multi-year deal at less annually. We use the new space to lock down Payne and maybe Craig. If we can then get a backup 5 behind Ayton at a reasonable price, I think we're set to see what we can do for a few years. At that point our team looks like:  Guards of CP3, Book, Cam Payne, and Jevon Carter on multi year deals  Forwards of Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Centers of Ayton, the hypothetical backup I talked about and Dario"
"Sorry I just woke up. Keon Johnson is a guy at the very beginning of the college season were saying was flying high under the radar until mocks started catching up. He's the type where eye test &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his superficial stats. His upside is extremely high. Let me explain the love for Keon:  1) He's arguably the best defensive SG prospect in the draft (maybe only Moody is better) and even though he's 6'5, he has a 6'8 wingspan.  2) Although his shooting splits were bad, he has a very mechanically sound jumper and college shooting is notoriously small sample size for a variable that requires a very high sample size for confidence  3) He has a really strong IQ for off-ball movement, his off-ball cutting is elite.  4) He's amazing at drawing fouls and getting to the line - 40% FT/FA rate. Combined with a tight handle, elite athleticism, and a solid FG% at the rim makes him very projectable as a guy who will be able to get to the rim in the NBA.  5) Both him and Jaden Springer are both SGs - so play finishing wasn't really overly productive at Tennessee due to a lack of playmaking  So you have a guy who is a great defender, can handle well, is great at getting to the basket whether that's through FTs or getting around his man, and the only real flaw is he shot terribly in college which ruined his production numbers, but there's nothing real mechanically wrong or shot that needs to be re-worked. Additionally, pretty much all other alternatives are equally as flawed or moreso - Scottie Barnes doesnt have a jumper, Jalen Johnson terribly underperformed in pretty much all aspects, Davion Mitchell and Bouknight are already older and behind on the NBA development curve, etc."
"So yeah, this is based on who i think will go higher, not who I think is better. I don’t think Mitchell is a lottery talent, but so many mocks I’ve seen have him as high as 6, I think he goes in the lottery, for better or for worse.  Another one is Isaiah Jackson vs Sengun.  I like Sengun better, but knowing Charlotte’s affinity for going for high profile college guys (plus the Kentucky pedigree) that I think they go Jackson.  Jalen Johnson vs Franz Wagner vs Corey Kispert also has me unsure where they are going to go.  Jalen clearly has the most upside but I really don’t know how much his “diva” antics at Duke will push him down. The opposite for Kispert - I think his defense is really sus, but his box score numbers might be super attractive to a higher lottery team to grab him"

I mean sure but toppin had pedigree... jalen smith was outta nowhere and his position and skillset is not really important. Cam Johnson was deemed a gamble but he at least can shoot and is a lengthy wing. Other problem with “developing” a guy.. his rookie contract ends and now what.. you gotta pay him if he shows any promise. I think if you take big men they have to be sure things like ayton otherwise get them in free agency
"That Bridges trade, Cam Johnson   I still for the record hate their last pick tho.. jalen smith   Halliburton was the pick.. imagine him taking over for paul, giving booker a break or just taking Torrey Craig mins in small ball lineup"

Jalen Harris? Paul Watson? Stanley Johnson? WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
"And it don't stop with him. It does not stop with him. Jason Peters was told he was too old, didn't have it anymore. Before he got hurt, he was the best freaking tackle in the NFL. Big V was told he didn't have it. Stefen Wisniewski ain't good enough.  Jason Kelce is too small. Lane Johnson can't lay off the juice. Brandon Brooks has anxiety. Carson Wentz didn't go to a Division I school. Nick Foles don't got it. Corey Clement's too slow. LeGarrette Blount ain't got it anymore. Jay Ajayi can't stay healthy. Torrey Smith can't catch. Nelson Agholor can't catch. Zach Ertz can't block. Brent Celek's too old. Brandon Graham was drafted too high. Vinny Curry ain't got it. Beau Allen can't fit the scheme. Mychal Kendricks can't fit the scheme. Nigel Bradham can't catch. Jalen Mills can't cover. Patrick Robinson can't cover. It's the whole team. It's the whole team."
"Just some incredible names on that list, but Stanley Johnson stands out. Paul Watson and Jalen Harris probably have outside fans confused too. Now we just need Malachi Flynn and Khem Birch to join the party."
"We did do that with Jalen Smith, but he has definitely been a project.  He was a reach where we took him (similar to what Jones did with Cam Johnson the year before), so coming into the season he was fairly raw. Then the lack of summer league hurt him, and he got Covid at the start of the season which also delayed his development.  Honestly, my theory is we drafted him in preparation for future years to have a full squad, and then we overachieved this year and entered win now mode, which makes the pick look worse than it probably will end up being."
Jalen Johnson is not actually good at basketball tho. I feel like Moody or Franz Wagner would be a great pick if they stay at 9.

"big fan of Moody. Also dont think Sengun is a reach at that pick, really a big fan of his defense and IQ. Usman Garuba and Franz Wagner are two that I like. Think Jalen Johnson is a good high upside pick but he's a bit of a project.  Not a fan of Kispert or Williams. I like Kai Jones for the right team, but dont think the Kings are it.  Everyone else I like at that pick range is a guard."
"Part of me thinks they need to go with a high upside forward - so any of Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson or Josh Giddey.  Kai Jones also makes sense if they think they're going to be out a big with Richaun Holmes potentially leaving. Also Kai Jones is supposed to be a half-decent 3-point shooter which would be nice against Bagley."
Jalen Johnson off the bench 👀
"&gt; The very fact you have a 5 who is capable of playmaking out of the low post is a beauty in the modern nba.   It's really not that rare of a skill anymore, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson, Mobley, Prkacin, Wagner, pretty much all the bigs of note in this class can facilitate out of the post.   The notable value point is when you can use those guys as actual primary or secondary playmakers, which is where a guy like Scottie Barnes separates himself.   Even after the Barnes tier, I'd take Prkacin, Mobley, and Jalen Johnson as guys who could develop into 2ndary playmakers before Sengun."
"I definitely feel that Sengun goes in the top 10.  Jalen Johnson would definitely be a good pick for y’all though, especially with so many guards already"
"I want Alperen Sengun so damn much but I'm worried the Hornets will take him just before us. If not, I would take Jalen Johnson. If not I would highly consider trading down with like OKC or Knicks."
I’m all in on Kai Jones and Jalen Johnson then if those 2 are gone I will angrily accept Ziaire or Sengun.   I hate the fact that Giddey is mocked to us so much but that’s a topic I can spend 10 minutes on so I’ll leave that alone lmao

Theres a Jalen Johnson too? This Jalen thing is getting outta hand.
Is Jalen Johnson Klutch too?
"The Suns will:  CP3 either, decline his PO and sign him to a 3 year deal, or accept his PO and sign him to a much smaller 2 year extension. That'll be the end for CP3.  Booker is already signed on for 3 years, no sign he wouldn't further extend.  Ayton has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 35 Mil per year.  Crowder has 2 more years left, on a MLE deal. I would expect a much smaller pay packet to extend him further than that for another 3 years with bird rights, that gets him to 36 years old. So 5 years total.  Saric, has 2 years on his deal... but this is a real unknown, he's now out next season as backup centre. He is also going to be coming back from major injury so I'll hold off on any further contracts. Suns have applied for a disabled player exception for next season, 4.5mil. I would expect to see the Suns sign JaVale McGee to fill that spot. The one thing the Suns lacked was that one extra ""BIG"".  Bridges has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 20 Mil per year.  Jalen Smith has 3 years left on his rookie deal, I would expect him to hang around for the duration of that as the 3rd string centre. Depending how he develops will decide whether he stays longer.  Cameron Johnson has 2 years left on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 year 15 Mil per year.  Jevon Carter has 2 years left on an early bird, currently not getting time as a 3rd string, maybe that'll Change next year.  Now the unknowns, I see the Suns chucking Payne a 3 year 15mil total deal. Other teams will offer more, but the Suns will be reigning Champions... so what will he decide...  Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, Craig and Nader will probably get some 1 year minimums.  Ty-Shon will get another 2 way deal next year.  I don't know what the Suns will do with their only draft pick. But it'll be pretty tradeable.   The Suns will basically have the same team for 3 years, maybe changing a couple 3rd string guys adding one more centre like JaVale. Then for the next 3 years still have a core of Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Johnson, Crowder, with unknowns being Starting PG, and some backups."
"Jalen Johnson: It's time for someone who has the courage to stand up and say,  I'm against those things that everybody hates!   John Jalenson: Now, I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man. But quite frankly… I agree with everything he just said."
"Just received an update, we've settled on Jalen Johnson-James Porter Jr."
Close but it's actually Jalen Johnson-James Jr.
Well we’ve got Jalen Johnson coming in this year so we’re almost there lol
"Trey Murphy III. Big, sweet-shooting wing with defensive upside. Played 3 years in college (older prospect).  Will likely take Jalen Johnson if he falls to 17.  Will trade up to get Kispert/ Moody if available at 10 or 14 if either the Pels are desperate to dump the Bledsoe contract or the Warriors are looking to reduce the luxury tax impact."
"You’re missing the point completely, I brought up EJ to show that getting an awards ballot has nothing to do with ability to host a show. Ernie Johnson and the TNT crew have won what feels like 100 Emmys and EJ is regarded as one of the best at his job ever (he’s in the BBall HOF), yet he didn’t get a ballot for voting until relatively recently despite having been at TNT for over 30 years. This shows that your ability to do a job hosting an NBA show has nothing to do with you voting for awards, the NBA’s voting process is faulty and needs to be overhauled.  Rose and Woj are 2/3 panelists currently on the Countdown show. The same show Rachel is complaining about wanting to host and when you don’t get along with the main people you are supposed to be working with, you’re the problem and the one who needs to be replaced. Also happens that most of the people at ESPN speaking up for Maria are black (Linda Johnson, Jalen Rose, Ryan Clark) what a surprise they would take exception to her insinuating a coworker only got a job because of her race."
"Yeah and Maria Taylor does a better job hosting. She plays the role of a moderator better and allows the other analysts like Woj, Jalen Rose, etc. to do more of the talking instead of going on tangents like Rachel. There’s a reason the ESPN countdown crew likes her better and why Rose has publicly spoken up for her while Woj has called Rachel “a bad teammate”.  Once again I agree that was a huge mistake and I don’t think either of them deserve an MVP vote, but that has nothing to do with their abilities to host the pregame show. Ernie Johnson (one of the most respected hosts in the business) went a long time before he got a vote too."
"I meant Keon Johnson, but yea Jalen Johnson definitely has star potential if he works past his mental stuff. Had he not quit on two teams he’d def be going top 5, that’s how talented he is. I think he’s the MPJ/KPJ of this draft"
Jalen Johnson
They will probably trade it. If they don’t then I would say Jalen Johnson
Mock Draft [Week #29](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o9jrfz/mock_draft_monday_game_thread_index/h3bj3my/)  1) Detroit - Cade Cunningham - PG - OK St  2) Houston - Jalen Green - SG - G-League  3) Cleveland - Evan Mobley - C - USC  4) Toronto - Jalen Suggs - G - Gonzaga  5) Orlando - Jonathan Kuminga - F - G-League  6) Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes - F - FSU  7) Golden State - James Bouknight - SG - UConn  8) Orlando - Keon Johnson - SG - Tenn  9) Sacramento - Franz Wagner - F - Michigan  10) New Orleans - Moses Moody - G/F - Arkansas  11) Charlotte - Alperen Sengun - C - Turkey  12) San Antonio - Jalen Johnson - F - Duke  13) Indiana - Davion Mitchell - G - Baylor  14) Golden State - Corey Kispert - SF - Gonzaga  15) Washington - Josh Giddey - PG - Australia  16) Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba - PF/C - Spain  17) Memphis - Cam Thomas - SG - LSU  18) Oklahoma City - Sharife Cooper - PG - Auburn  19) New York - Isaiah Jackson - C - Kentucky  20) Atlanta - Jaden Springer - G - Tenn  21) New York - Tre Mann - PG - Florida  22) LA Lakers - Kai Jones - C - Texas  23) Houston - Jared Butler - G - Baylor  24) Houston - Ziaire Williams - F - Stanford  25) LA Clippers - Chris Duarte - G/F - Oregon  26) Denver - Josh Primo - G/F - Alabama  27) Brooklyn - JT Thor - PF - Auburn  28) Philadelphia - Trey Murphy - SF - Virginia  29) Phoenix - Miles McBride - PG - West Virginia  30) Utah - Greg Brown - PF - Texas
"Like I said he makes good enough points, it's just hard having to listen to all the fluff before he gets to the point. Maybe he's changed in the last couple of years but whenever I'd listen to him on Grantland back in the day it felt like he was trying to fill out the word count for a school paper or something.  Jalen: ""The Spurs will be contenders.""  ""Tim Duncan, 15x All-Star, 2x league MVP. 5 rings in 18 years. Never missed the Playoffs or won less than 50 games. One of the NBA's nice guys. Doesn't say much, but he's a competitor. You gotta be to win 5 rings... and play for the same team.""  ""Tony Parker. 4x league champion. One of the best Point Guards of the past 15 years. Driving to the lane, hitting the floater. He can do it all man.""  ""Kawhi Leonard. DPOY. San Diego State alumni. He has a Finals MVP in his trophy case too. The youngest EVER after Magic Johnson, the greatest PG ever who has 5 rings and 9 Finals appearances, with some of the best showdowns ever with the Celtics, always willing to take a picture. Kawhi can do it all man!""  It gets boring after a while lol"
"Especially since Rachel Nichols is more experienced and was already assigned NBA Finals hosting duties in previous years and had them being taken away.  Not sure if Maria Taylor is any good, but Nichols is a good host. The ESPN studio show is a wreck this playoffs, but that’s primarily because Jalen Rose and Jay Williams are both terrible. Not sure if that says Taylor is bad or not herself. If she had better talent to work with like Richard Jefferson or Paul Pierce it might be better, but I feel like an elite host like Ernie Johnson would be able to pull together a decent show even with the lack of talent there."
I think Giddey (and honestly all of the other jumbo playmaker wings like Wagner and Jalen Johnson) will be off the table by then. Giddey is pretty heavily mocked for Indiana.   I’ve seen Davion Mitchell and Moses Moody mocked to you all and they seem pretty solid as high floor prospects who could give you all some Immediate depth. Not high on Moody that much anymore since he’s bit undersized to be a 3&amp;D wing but yeah
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
"Tier one is absolutely bonkers but after that these are some creative ideas. I’m not sure how Jalen Green falls to the warriors at 7 though, you’d probably have to be anticipating more of a Keon Johnson around there"
"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"Honestly, almost worth taking the chance on Jalen Johnson if he's there at that point."
"just wondering, what's so great about Jalen Johnson"
"No problem, I've legit forgot Jalen Johnson before so I understand it. I have Roko in the 25-35 range."
"Assuming Wiggins is the salary filler I would do 7 + Wiseman but Ide try and push for 14 as well, maybe send them our 2 seconds back if we need to.   Suggs, FVV, Wiggins, OG, Wiseman. With a bench of GTJ, Boucher, Birch, +2 lotto picks (maybe Jalen Johnson + Kai Jones) would be a super fun season."
DET - Cade Cunningham   HOU - Evan Mobley   CLE - Jalen Green   TOR - Jalen Suggs   ORL - Jonathan Kuminga   OKC - Scottie Barnes   GSW - Moses Moody   ORL - James Bouknight   SAC - Jalen Johnson   NOP - Franz Wagner   CHA - Kai Jones   SAS - Alperen Sengun   IND - Davion Mitchell   GSW - Josh Giddey
"Absolutely. His ceiling is through the roof (Embiid without playmaking or spacing but with fewer injury concerns) and he's clearly made strides on both sides of the ball.  One future concern is that the Suns' cap sheet will get crowded in a couple years. Their young core may be considered to be Booker, Ayton, Bridges, and Cam Johnson. If you're James Jones, you have to at least give Booker/Ayton/Bridges the bag. (Also assuming Jalen Smith doesn't turn into a player worth keeping.) Note: the bag doesn't necessarily mean the max, but Bridges deserves just compensation as an elite prototypical 3&amp;D wing that every team needs.  Also, Cam Payne will absolutely get paid this offseason, Moore, Galloway, Nader, Craig, and Kaminsky are solid end of the rotation guys and I anticipate at least one of those guys (Craig?) getting like $3-5M/yr. Maybe they'd take a discount if they can run it back because they're all on mins, but I doubt the Suns will retain such great depth."
"In the early 2010s they had guys like Mike Wilbon, Jalen Rose, Magic Johnson and Bill Simmons. Way better than this."
I hope the Hornets either go for Alperen Sengun or Jalen Johnson.
"Any one of Moody, Franz Wagner, Jalen Johnson, Sengun, Ziaire Williams or Kai Jones, in that order"
"If we package 19/21 and trade up - Bouknight is my personal fav. But I wouldn’t mind Moody, Ziaire, Keon, Davion, Giddey   If we stay at 19/21 I’m down with any two of: Sharife, Duarte, Springer, Jalen Johnson"
"Honestly, I wouldn't mind doing that and getting either a shooter (Kispert) or a project (Jalen Johnson) at 11. More realistically Kispert:  Garland, Sexton, Okoro, Love, Mobley.  Vet PG, Osman, Kispert, Washington, Hartenstein."
Could take a flier on Greg Brown  Maybe Zhaire but i doubt he falls that low  CBS has Jalen Johnson falling to us at 24 lmao mock drafts are dumb asl
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
"There are local guys who break stories. Gambo (@Gambo987) on the local radio station broke the positive test, Jalen Smith pick, Cam Johnson trade/draft, etc.  But I've never seen Duane Rankin do it."
"The difference between 6 and 9 is being in position for Kuminga or Barnes vs being in position for Jalen Johnson, Sengun, and Moody.   There is more upside at 6 and there’s absolutely a difference there."
"Suns Booker OR AYTON FOR THE FIRST PICK????!?!!? thats LUDICROUS.... maybe Cam Payne or Cam Johnson+Jalen Smith for the first pick, but NEVER those two....  Besides, they should take a page from the Suns...get a competent developmental coach and grow your talent from within :-)"
"I guess its just the position on how it played out, Jalen Johnson might not fit a need but its clearly a decent value play at 21. I'm also a believer in Herb Jones in the NBA. I guess if you take fit out of the equation, I dont really hate any of the NYK picks outside of Jackson. Pick 58 is a lottery ticket no matter what"
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
"I haven’t seen one person say they hope Barnes turns into Kawhi, they play nothing alike other than the fact they’re both good defenders. People argue taking Barnes over Kuminga strictly because Barnes has a higher floor than him and a floor as high as anyone in this class. Jalen Johnson’s stats are misleading compared to his actual game and play style, Barnes was the better college player.   Johnson isn’t a secondary scorer dude isn’t even a reliable half court scorer. And he’s definitely not a creator outside anywhere but the open floor. He’s not a good 3pt shooter. Dude made 8 total 3s in college, shot a bad free throw percentage, hesitated on shots and he has bad mechanics. He’s a better rebounder than Barnes I’ll give you that his rebounding will translate, and Johnson is a good help defender so the block stat makes sense. Barnes is worlds ahead of him as a defender being a impact defender and switchable 1-5, Barnes was a legitimate playmaking option and half court ball handler at FSU so the playmaking thing isn’t even comparable also (Johnson had a negative Assist to turnover ratio). You have it completely flipped around, Barnes is the more NBA ready guy and Johnson is project. Scouting guys is deeper than just looking at their stats"
Everything since 2006 has been punishment for just being Kings fans lol. Lets be real even if we somehow got #1 we would have taken jalen johnson or something
Imagine you guys draft Jalen Johnson on accident.
Jalen Johnson got a good shot but his FT is concerning
"Nah this draft real deep   They could get Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Kuminga, all very high upside   Idk shit about Scottie Barnes who they are projected tho lol"

"[Most recent mock](https://fanspo.com/nba/s/celtics/mock-drafts/Pp9gtIeVLW_mo8/suggs-2). I definitely let Jalen Johnson slide too far- I’ve read about possible character issues and I don’t love his game, but his ceiling’s probably too high for him to escape the lottery undrafted."
"Jalen and Simmons had an unmatched chemistry and were actually good media personalities together. What made them great is they knew good broadcasting was actually having a discussion versus who can dunk on who harder or making a clip for twitter. Magic Johnson wasn’t bad either. Ever since then it’s been the awful production with people who have no chemistry, nor the talent to speak and analyze"
Whoever’s left of Mobley/Green/Suggs in that order at 4  16 if Giddey is there I’d take him for sure. I also like Garuba or if Jalen Johnson settles into this range  18 whoever’s left of Garuba/Jalen/Giddy if they’re available
"Honestly, I think most Thunder fans are so focused on praying they get two Top 5 picks in the lottery, they haven’t bothered thinking about later picks. But personally, I hope they get a wing. I like trying to trade up for Moses Moody in the late lottery, but there have also been rumors that Presti gave a promise to Chris Duarte.  EDIT: As for picks in the 20s, Jalen Johnson seems like the high-upside, low-floor pick Presti likes to take chances on."
"Naw I’m familiar with the class. It’s a great class but it’s top heavy. Realistically at 16, the guys in that range who we were gonna be looking at was Jalen Johnson, Isaiah Jackson, Tre Mann and Like Corey Kispert. Good prospects sure, but outside of like Mann I’m not upset about not being able to get any of those guys or more guys in that range if it meant getting off Kemba’s deal"
He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
Magic would take Bouk or Jalen Johnson IMO
Yeah.  If we can somehow replicate yalls rebuild that would be legit amazing. Y’all went deep in the postseason without Hunter and then added Cooper and Jalen Johnson. Sheesh
No Jalen Johnson  Sad!!!
"Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15OA with the expectation that he would be a good 3+D in the NBA. Certainly no one expected him to be a top-5 NBA player but everyone expected him to be a defensive stalwart, especially once San Antonio drafted him.  Anyway, that's all to say that I absolutely agree with you on these things being teachable but that's why I'm suggesting it's a lazy comparison. He's got the size of Kawhi and is probably more athletic, but not much else is remotely comparable.  Any one of these prospects could flip a switch and develop BBIQ and defensive acumen. Will they? Likely not. But maybe they will. Even so, I'm not sitting here saying Jalen Johnson or Tre Mann or whoever else is going to be Kawhi Leonard because they have similar height.  I'm sure Kuminga will be a good to great talent. But I feel like the Kawhi comparisons are just sports writers pandering to GSW fans for off-season clicks."
You could have a deep team if you chose Jalen   - Jalen Rose - Jalen Green - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Johnson - Jalen Suggs - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith  Funnily enough a lot of them are really young
This is talking about Jalen Johnson
Jalen Johnson is going to be a monster I'm so excited we drafted him
"Jalen Johnson was great. Outside of the 2nd half vs Philadelphia, he was very productive and the game looked easy for him on most possessions. Good signs  Too bad Collins, Gallo, Hunter, Reddish, and Huerter all get the lions share of minutes at the 3 and 4"
"Jalen Johnson fastbreak dunk, was top 5 in my book"
"This was such a strange draft honestly, partially because it was ridiculously deep seeming, and also because a lot of NBA teams didn't get to watch these guys play in person bc of the pandemic restrictions. You can bring them in for a workout sure, but only so many guys, and playing in a meaningful 5v5 game is totally different to 1v0 or even group workouts.  In a normal year someone with Boston's college season would still probably go 2nd round but like in the 30s, not 53. Guys who dropped in this draft *really* dropped, because the average player was so much better than usual, and so less incentive to take a chance. Sengun, Cooper, Jalen Johnson, Keon and Boston are all excellent examples of this."
"Cooper is an absolute steal at 48 and Jalen Johnson at 20 was also a steal. Johnson looking really, REALLY good but no one talking about him. Averaged like 22 during the summer league with a couple massive dunks and a poster over the dude who’s picture was used lol"
He also left out Jalen Johnson
Didn't realize.   Some rookies do skip summer league at times. Like I didn't DeAndre Hunter or Cam Reddish in the Hawks summer their rookie year. I dunno if both were injured or what.    I did get to see Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper ballin out this summer league tho
Jalen Johnson had lottery pick potential so close enough
"Josh Christopher, James Bouknight, Jalen Johnson, Ziaire Williams, Evan Mobley  My thinking was to start with the best player from 21-60, since it's the hardest place to find talent. Then go with Mobley since he's the highest value C and it's the hardest position to fill using this draft. From there, you slot in the BPA for each segment.   For 21-60, I went with Josh Christopher, but I could be sold on Cam Thomas or Miles McBride, maybe even Sharife Cooper. Just the highest ceiling guard in that range (deepest position overall)."
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jonathan Kuminga 5. Jalen Suggs 6. James Bouknight 7. Jalen Johnson 8. Alperen Sengun 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Davion Mitchell 11. Trey Murphy 12. Chris Duarte 13. Moses Moody 14. Josh Giddey

cam johnson and jalen smith
"Alperen Sengun, Jalen Johnson, Quentin Grimes, Cam Thomas and Miles McBride were the 5 who I felt dropped too far."
Cam Thomas at 27 and Jalen Johnson at 20 looking like the steals of the draft.
"This is what I replied too on this post so im glad I found this answer in the comments. Hunter is really, really good. Also, you guys have steal of the draft in Jalen Johnson so Hawks are gonna be goood."
"Can we mention rookies? If so, Jalen Johnson… Not only do I wanna see a kid from Wisconsin blow up, but just looking at his physical size and athleticism, dude has so much potential."
"As for the rookies, Jalen Johnson seems like he’s gonna be a dawg"
"I hope more than 15 of them become NBA mainstays just so I could field a team of Jalens on 2k.   A starting five of Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Brown, Jalen Johnson and Jalen McDaniels is easily a playoff contender, albeit a little backcourt-heavy.   Right now tho the bench seems pretty thin with Jalen Brunson as the only sure thing."
Thanks Brodie   I’m actually quite curious because you like Jalen Johnson which I suspect a lot of folk from Wisconsin don’t. Do you think he has character issues or is he just misunderstood if you don’t mind of course
"Best all Jalen roster? Suggs, Green, Brown, Johnson, Smith would be pretty damn good, especially in 5 years."
"Jalen Johnson tonight: 25 PTS, 7 REB, 3 AST, 2 STL, 1BLK, 9/15 FG, 3/6 3PT"
"There’s a Jaylen Adam’s on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors. Jalen Crutcher, Jalen Green, Jaylen Hands, Jaylen Hoard, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Lecque, Jaylen Nowell, Jalen Smith, Jaleen smith (not a typo), Jalen Suggs, Jalen Tate. That’s just in the summer league. In the nba, there is also Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson."

NCAA propaganda machine doesn’t get talked about enough.  Just take this [clip](https://youtu.be/YhHSHFIrPOc) where Seth Greenberg attacks and relentlessly insults Jalen Johnson both as a person and as a basketball player
"I know someone else already answered and they answered well but I wanted to add why I feel like there’s still a gap.   Hunter seems the most well rounded out of our guys. Hasn’t flashed much as a passer so that may be his biggest limitation but on the positive side he shoots solid %, can create and dribble a bit on his own but isn’t too reckless on either side of the ball (if you watch reddish he gambles and tries to dunk when he should lay it in, plays a bit wild at times, and sometimes is too aggressive on D, etc… hunter is the opposite and plays very smart safe and within himself) and he has a great strong build and IQ for covering 1-4 on defense. If he improves in all of those facets especially creating for himself by getting to the paint this guy can be something super special.   The thing with Collins in my opinion is that if you watch him play and watch his athleticism it seems that he’s the “springy” kind of athletic where he’s so light and has such a good vertical that he can rise up high very fast. Doesn’t have much of a post game but with his back to the basket he just turns and rises quickly and pushes the ball in. Either that, or in a face up just a simple midrange jumper that he can get off because he has a quick hop to him, not much in the way of actual footwork. Solid 3 point shooter too, and a great motor, definitely showed it some in the playoffs with all those offensive rebounds. Besides that he is a very limited passer and dribbler. With that “springy” athleticism I don’t expect him to go Heat Lebron or anything and add significant weight (though I do believe it would benefit him), which is a shame since that’s been a big problem for him defensively. Feel like he doesn’t have enough handles outside to play the 3 but doesn’t have enough weight and strength to play a great defensive 4. It’ll be interesting to see how Jalen Johnson will do with our squad because Johnson has much better vision and can dunk extremely high as well but has more of a versatile arsenal, especially putting the ball down and creating for himself which is something Collins cannot do very well.   So Hunter seems like he can improve on a lot of these things (even if he stays where he’s at he’s super solid) whereas it feels like John’s ceiling can’t move too much, which is why hawks believe it could be Hunter &gt; JC soon."
Hawks got one in Jalen Johnson
"Hi! OKC fan here! I love giddey but no way hes better than Kuminga. I love Tre Mann but hes not better than Sengun, kai jones, jalen johnson. We really messed up. now we wait for Zion to request a trade"
"Favorite Summer League rook not on your team? Loved watching Davion, Duarte, Shareef, Jalen Johnson and Suggs last week.   There's like 40 dudes balling out at NBASL this year. Draft class is legit!"
"Hunter pre-injury was already better than Anunoby, and Jalen Johnson has been better than Barnes in Summer League so far.   Neither of these are hot takes at all."
You really think Jalen Johnson will be better than Barnes? And Hunter better than OG? Yikes
Moody is a guard...... Both have defence..... Moody isnt more potential. They are both good and have upside.  Murphy is nice but you never take him there. Jalen is never taken there. Ziare wasnt in most people top 10. I like the pick though.   Also 90% of rookies are going to be back ups. Unsure why now its not okay? moody is a back up. Ziare is a back up. Johnson is a back up.
You forgot to mention our first round draft pick Jalen Johnson.   We also added Gorgui Dieng as our backup big and Delon Wright as our backup point guard
Jaylen Brown  Jaylen Nowell  Jalen Johnson   Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Brunson  Jalen Smith  Jaylen Hoard  There’s also 2-3 other Jalens/Jaylens who are young UFAs
Can you name 2 rookies this year who have larger character concerns than Jalen Johnson? He might be the biggest character concern player in the whole draft.  Character concerns *had* to be major for him to drop that far.
Don’t let this guy find out about Jalen Johnson.
Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper
"Damn, I put 5k on Jalen Johnson dropping out first"
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher’s defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade’s poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He’s good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can’t create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it’s over. He won’t get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
"There’s a lot of mellifluous J-names: Jalen Johnson, Jarrett Jacks (retired), Jared Jeffries (retired), Justin Jackson"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
Jalen Johnson looked solid and he’s gonna win MVP this year so
"Fair enough, I don’t think his athleticism is bad. He’s certainly no keon Johnson or Jalen green but it’s more than passable, mainly due to his size, nba ready frame and strength. Hoping he does well but only time will tell"
&gt; The fact he and Jalen Johnson  Jalen Johnson went at a reasonable position and so did this kid. Johnson was mediorce all season for Duke and quit on his team.  Sharife Cooper shot terrible in college so he seems like a long shot in the NBA despite being highly ranked.
Jalen Johnson next KD? Sharife the next CP3?
Aren't we talking about Jalen Johnson tho...
"100%. Nuggets with MPJ and Bol Bol are prime examples and 1/2 have paid off big so far. I wasn’t as high on cooper as most but I had him mid 30s, not 48. Jalen Johnson on the other hand I thought would’ve went 9th/10th in the draft when I mocked it and honestly thought he would’ve been a perfect addition for the kings at 9. Draft season is a roller coaster and I love it"
"Quite the contrary sir, Jalen Johnson is sharif’s friend."
Number 1 would be Jalen Johnson
"#1 is Jalen Johnson, who is having a great Summer league debut so far."
The fact he and Jalen Johnson fell so far in the draft and the hawks scooped both is an absolute robbery
Gallo played 24 minutes a game. If/when he gets hurt they're way more likely to try and have Reddish/Hunter play minutes at the 4 than give Jalen Johnson 20 minutes a game.
I really really wanted him on the Spurs. I hope Primo is the real deal because I think Jalen Johnson is
They hit it out of the park with the Cam Johnson pick and then messed the Jalen Smith one up. Perfectly balanced
"We got center and guard depth now with 2 nice acquisitions in Dieng and Delon Wright.  We were one of the most injured teams last year and if Jalen Johnson turns up like he's been, even better forward depth than before which was bad cause we had to start solo (love the dude but he's not a starter)"
"&gt;He's worked JJJ, Jalen Johnson, JR Smith, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Clarkson  What about J Jonah Jameson? Or Jonas Jorgenson?"
"ChrisJohnsonHoops on IG.  He's worked JJJ, Jalen Johnson, JR Smith, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Clarkson and others recently too. Not much to read into."
"It's better if you want to impress Summer League reactionaries lol.   Jalen Johnson hadn't played a game since February and dropped 20/10 and was as impressive as Green/Kuminga, what's the spin for that?  As far as LaMelo, I think if Edwards played on a team as good as Charlotte/wasn't forced to be the #1 option with DLo and KAT out, he wouldve had a very comparable rookie year to LaMelo.   As far as Wiseman, he didn't even play college ball, so ofc he was gonna be behind."
None...Jalen Johnson 20 and 10 and 8/12 from field with crazy chase down block and good defence. Looks likes Hawks hit again..
Jalen Johnson looked pretty nutty. Curious how he works his way into the rotation for the Hawks.
Jalen Johnson
Jalen Johnson no bias
Yeah if he keeps improving he will do as good as Hawks 20th pick Jalen Johnson...🤣🤣
"Man I know that feeling all too well, I used to spend the summers in San Antonio with family and those spurs championships were incredible to watch. I'm a big mavs and rockets fan but I'm always glad when the spurs do good as well. I think Texas basketball is gonna have a big time resurgence soon with Luka, Jalen Green, and Keldon Johnson."
Jalen Johnson really persevered through thick and thin that first game. Great resilience that game
Jalen Johnson dropped 20 &amp; 10 in his debut.
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
"I'd like to nominate the Hawks as a very deep roster as well. Legit 2 deep at every spot.    PG- Trae, Delon Wright, Lou Will  SG- Bogi, Huerter, Mays  SF- Hunter, Cam, Solomon Hill  PF- Collins, Gallo, rookie Jalen Johnson  C- Capela, OO and Gorgui"
&gt;Jalen Green. Jalen Suggs. Jalen Johnson.... Jalen Duren.   Jalen stonks to da moon.
"I mean it was a solid off-season. Two steals in terms of raw talent in Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper respective to their draft positions. Turning two literal zeroes on a roster in Dunn and Fernando into Delon Wright who’s a  very capable backup. Resigning Collins for effectively 4 yr/100 is a fair deal. Signed Dieng of course for relatively cheap and he’ll help against bigger teams and be a stop gap till Okungwu returns from injury. And Lou will returning to mentor Cooper and give us quick buckets if needed.  While we Hawks fan are super excited about the direction of the team, we didn’t knock it out of the park in terms of free agency. We signed exactly what we needed and ducked off. The real prize is having a potentially healthy roster. Hunter and Reddish especially. That will be a bigger addition than any free agent on the market."
Jalen Johnson. Not biased at all
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
Or jalen johnson
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
So do the Hawks but we're actually good   Trae: 22   Collins: 23   Hunter: 23   Cam: 21   Huerter: 22   Okongwu: 20   Sharife Cooper: 20   Jalen Johnson: 19   Skylar Mays: 23   Actually we have 9
"Yeah, the depth we have could be insane  Trae, Delon, Sharife  Bogi, Huerter  Hunter, Cam  JC, Gallo, Jalen Johnson  Capela, Onyeka, Dieng"
"Okay you're ALL OVER the place with this one.  &gt; Considering what is happening in Brooklyn, you hardly have an argument for the city here.  Brooklyn? That's virtue of a superteam and the difference should be VERY obvious. Knicks are also NY, yet aren't getting shit for FAs. You hardly have an argument for the city here.  Expectations? Bruh Jalen Johnson is a freshman 5 star recruit outta Duke arguably as athletic as JC, longer than JC, 4 years younger than JC and actually shot more than JC did in college. Not to mention he can actually dribble a bit better and flashes playmaking ability - two things that JC struggle with mightily. JJ is a good prospect and a GREAT value pick at 20.  Hawks re-signing JC is the priority and its keeping me up at night but in the event that Collins wants to leave, Jalen Johnson is the prospect I want in his wake. Nowhere do I even imply that I want him to replace or become a max contract player, just that we have him if John forces his way out and we aren't ""without any option"" as you claimed.  &gt; So We are talking about max contracts and you bring up 35 year Rondo who commited a robbery on you  Rondo - easily Hawks worst move last offseason - but what robbery? He was traded for Lou Will (helped us get to ECF), 2 future 2nds, and cash. Lou Will salary just came off the books while Clippers are still paying Rondo $7.5m this season. Its kinda funny to watch you babble on when you dont understand what you're talking about.  Where are you getting this stuff about max players?! You realize there's an entire spectrum in between the minimum and maximum contracts, right? Here is [John Collins' BORD$](https://i.imgur.com/n0CKmvS.jpg) valuation. It's a near certainty, given salary cap landscape of the league that Atlanta re-signs him closer to the $26m/yr valuation than the max.  Atlanta VERY MUCH has a choice and them not being NY, LA, or Miami doesn't change that like you claim.   #Hell, at this point in FA John Collins is only a max player if the Atlanta Hawks say so."
"Knicks haven't extended anyone because they are a bad run organization and drafted terrible.  Fournier and Noel were available on the market, you have Work with what you have had. Considering what is happening in Brooklyn, you hardly have an argument for the city here.   Jalen Johnson is who exactly? A kid with zero NBA games and you expect him to replace a borderline max player on your roster? Those are just unfair expectations for the kid.  So We are talking about max contracts and you bring up 35 year Rondo who commited a robbery on you so that he can sign with Clippers? Galinari and Bogi? Who exactly is a max player here?  What exactly Robinson and Nunn have to do with the conversation? You suggest that Nunn is some tier player? And what about Robinson, he is a proven elite shooter and you somehow thing that he doesn't deserve those money?  My argument ita pretty clear while you react chaotically and blame me for your extreme bias..   Good luck replacing max contract with Galo and Rondo.."
"Thats just flat out absurd.  First off, Knicks haven't even extended a player that they've drafted since 1994. They also just paid a New York premium to lure a player in Evan Fournier for $18m/yr and keep Nerlens for $10.7/yr  Second, Miami just signed Duncan Robinson to $90m and lost Kendrick Nunn for nothing.  Finally, Hawks just drafted Jalen Johnson. I hope the highest of hopes that we re-sign JC to $125m/5 and think its beyond fair, especially if we structure it well. But if there were a single guy that I would choose to replace JC someday? Its Jalen Johnson.  Hawks also landed several of the hottest FAs last season in Gallinari, Bogi, and Rondo  Your comment has little to no basis and is grounded entirely in the faulty perception of media's ""big market"" clickfarm bs"
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
Hopefully all the minutes he would’ve gotten go to Jalen Johnson
I think wolves will end up getting him. They basically drafted his hopeful replacement in Jalen Johnson anyways
Trae Young   De’Andre Hunter   Cam Reddish  John Collins   Jalen Johnson
I would've loved to see Jalen Johnson in OKC to be completely honest. He's going to rot in the G league in Atlanta.
"He might be one of those guys where on paper it feels like how are they successful?, but all the intangibles eventually add up to an incredibly valuable talent.   Picking at 6 is also hard. The main “potential star” talents yall passed on were Kuminga &amp; Bouknight and they’re certainly not guaranteed at all to be good. The other “maybe star” dudes like Zaire or Jalen Johnson were just not worth the 6th pick.   Just gotta hope next year the tank leads you to Chet haha"
"Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith, and two firsts probably"
This is why Schlenk is the 🐐. Hunter/Huerter/Cam all with superb D and good shooting. Now adding Jalen Johnson
Pretty sure we got Fs for Cam Johnson and Jalen Smith
"What are the concerns with Jalen Johnson? Is it simply that he left school early? I hear a lot about teams be concerned about him, like he is a headcase or something"
"Why didn’t the spurs draft Sengun, Jalen Johnson or Kai Jones when we don’t have a single power forward on the team?"
Don’t forget Jalen Johnson
Hawks had a great draft sharif cooper is gonna be a steal and Jalen Johnson can be a very versatile player
"Yup. Coulda had a line up of  Giddey, sga, dort, poku, sengun  Jalen Johnson, maledon, jt Thor, etc"
Sengun and Jalen Johnson. Funnily enough those 2 were who I thought we’d take with 16&amp;18
"Better than John Collins, Trae, Deandre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, and the potential of Reddish, Okongwu, Jalen Johnson and Cooper?"
"Capela, Huerter, Reddish, Jalen Johnson, Gallo, and literally any pick you want for KAT"
"Suns fan,  Because we are not flying under the radar anymore. Easier to surprise teams when they don't know how good you are. Teams know now and will give us their best every game.  Also, Bucks exposed us a bit. Our offence is way too predictable and when they cut off passing lanes to Ayton they forced Booker and Paul to iso all game and they failed at that overall. Our offence needs to find a way to actually involve our dominant Center to be more than a lob threat.  Lastly, PF depth. Crowder will hold his own but losing Craig and having Saric injured leaves backup PF thin. Jalen Smith is not an NBA player as it stands and Cam Johnson is serviceable but still more a 3 than a 4. I hope we can trade for Thad Young"
"The following guys will play minutes at C before Jah:  * Capela  * Okongwu  * Dieng  * JC (small ball)  Guys who we have seen play small ball 5, but likely won't do it much barring serious injuries throughout the roster:  * Gallo  * Jalen Johnson (ideal position is 4, next best position is probably 3, but he played some 5 in summer league)"
"&gt;Hawks have done pretty decent with late first round picks. We got John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Jalen Johnson looks like he might be pretty good. If Detroit is rebuilding I think it would be wise to acquire as much firsts as possible and even if they don't want to draft late they can use multiple picks to move up in the draft. That's how we got De'andre Hunter. Jerami grant is good but Cade is so young. By the time he's ready to win I don't know how important grant will be to the team."
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
"There were individual forwards who initiated the offense before Nellie, like Rick Barry on the Warriors.  But those situations were more about the individual player having playmaking skills. Nellie was the first coach to really implement the point forward as a system.   When Pressey tested, Marques Johnson took over as the point forward. The backup point was another forward.  That's different than say, the Lakers. LeBron plays point forward, but it's not the whole Lakers system. When LeBron rested, it wasn't Kyle Kuzma running the offense, it was a regular PG like Shroeder. Or like how when Luka sits, Jalen Brunson runs the offense instead of another forward."
"Both Jalen Johnson and Rife probably not seeing much (if any) minutes this year with the rest of the depth we have, and we'll be missing OO for a few months but I still believe we'll have a very nice season."
"I like this one too, been thinking the same thing:   * They'll have a full season with McMillan, which will help them gel a bit more. Not only that, but they won 68.4% of their games with Nate last year, that's 56 win pace in a full, 82-game season.  * De'Andre Hunter will be back and healthy, people forget they were missing a starter who played like one of the best 3&amp;D wings to start the season.  * They brought back LouWill, who was a nice bench spark plug last year, drafted Sharife Cooper to give them some backup playmaking, picked up Gorgui Dieng (who's a reliable backup C) and Delon Wright (a really solid defensive guard), and they have a ton of high-potential guys like Cam Reddish/Jalen Johnson/Onkeya Okongwu who could break out."
"Phoenix Suns: pg chris paul sg devin booker sf mikal bridges pf crowder  c ayton  bench: payne, shamet, cam johnson, jalen smith, mcgee (if we trade for thaddeus young then insert him at pf)"
Yea and we have Jalen Johnson who’s looked pretty solid and Solomon Hill us a pretty solid 14th man I guess
"Starting: Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton Next 5: Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith, Javale McGee"
"Cam Johnson, Jae crowder, Jalen smith and a pick"
"Raptors: David Johnson  Hawks: Jalen Johnson &amp; Sharife Cooper   For the Raptors, Johnson is actually really interesting because he was actually mocked in the late lottery-first round range before Louisville hit a COVID pause in February and his efficiency tanked after.  I’m shocked he’s on a two way because he’s a pretty good prospect    For the Hawks, Johnson and Cooper are just two of the most talented player of the draft, but both probably won’t be able to find minutes his year (which isba food problem to have). Johnson’s a 6-9 forward with a great athleticism and passing but I actually think it’s good if he gets G league mins year 1 because he has been missing alot of games in his development (Injured at Duke and often in high school, in order for dev it makes more sense for him to play G league than 10 NBA mins) and Cooper had a first round grade in every mock/big board. Should be a cool year for both teams"
"Jalen Johnson is an absolute stud. We’ll have to see if Cooper can handle the ball a little better and avoid turnovers, that’s what he needs to be a impactful point guard"
"Jalen Johnson, BJ Boston, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Trey Lyles, JJJ, etc. There were a bunch of NBA guys there."
"Wym?  Atlanta has multiple prospects, Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, OO, Jalen Johnson, Cooper to name a few  Reddish and Huerter in particular is probably available"
If Jalen Johnson can play then Reddish is definitely gone. They gonna try to move Gallo and Reddish probably.
"Yeah I get that but I don’t see how either of those are similar to the hawks. I would say all 4 of Trae, Huerter, Hunter, Collins are established and fit well together. Reddish is a double digit scorer but efficiency has been bad - still shown big potential in ECF/end of rookie year. Okongwu dropping 21/15/3/2/2 in his only game over 30+ mins and shown a lot of potential in playoffs. Jalen Johnson hasn’t played yet but would be safe to safe to say he has massive potential. Wouldn’t even call guys like Semi, Langford, Grant mediocre at this point - they haven’t shown anything imo to say they are will even be solid role players."
"I mean, we got JC at 19, Huerter at 19, and this year Jalen Johnson at 20. I trust Schlenk to find guys that can be vet min quality players."
Plus Jalen Johnson who has the upside to wind up a Top-5 player from this draft class
Plus Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper
"Thad, Aminu, and Hutchinson for cam Johnson, Jalen Smith and a 1st"
"Ya for cam Johnson, Jalen Smith and a first. We'll throw in Aminu and Hutchinson"
"Not sure if it’s too early, but Jalen Johnson at PF."
"I made a 2021 draft class for NBA 2k21 at the beginning of last season when Boston was still projected top 10. I adjusted the draft class over the course of the year as guys rose and fell (like dropping Ziaire, boosting Sengun) but I didn't touch Boston, because that year for Kentucky was just weird and I'm not buying that it means anything.  Among non-Kentuckians I also didn't dock Josh Christopher or Jalen Johnson either. Them slipping felt like noise to me."
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
Him or Jalen Johnson are going to be the second best player that the hawks need
Well my answer is legitimately Jalen Johnson. I think he’s going to be great
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
"Trae 22 Collins 23 Hunter 23 Huerter 22 Reddish 21 Okongwu 20 Jalen Johnson 19  The point isn't really whether the Hawks can beat the Nets etc this year. The point is how well the Hawks should be set up for the next five years.   I agree that we'll need another star-level player. Maybe one of those guys on that list develops into it; if not, we've got all those guys and all our draft picks if a trade becomes available. A lot's going to have to go sideways for the Hawks to be a one-year fluke."
"Same team, more experience, healthy Hunter, adding ROTY Jalen Johnson, less refs foot getting stepped on. Yep, I like it"
"But that’s not always true.   The TNT guys, Jalen, Marcellus Wiley, Ernie Johnson are all former athletes off the top of my head who are great at what they do."
"Nah he reps Trae Young, Jalen Johnson and Cam Reddish so at the moment all my homies love Rich Paul"
"Idk what they are saying about only having 3 people for the suns lol we have  Cam johnson - 25 (Idk if 25 counts or not)  Mikal Bridges - 24  Devin Booker - 24  Landry Shamet - 24  Tyshon Alexander - 23 (2-way player, maybe actually on the roster this year)  Deandre Ayton - 23  Jalen Smith - 21  That’s 7 players, half our team 25 and under"
"That just means I'd question your ability to value players...they aren't star players or anything, but they have tons of young talent on that team. Hunter, Huerter, Collins, Okongwu, Reddish, plus now they have two high upside looking rookies in Jalen Johnson and Cooper. I would fail to see how the first 3 I listed aren't considered valuable by any team's standards."
"Cam is gunning but I like it. Bogi is still more valuable as the starter but we'll see how things develop.  Hunter is good, honestly the better he gets the more worried I get about managing our depth of talent.  Collins needs to be featured more, he's already good at doing all the little stuff.  We've got good depth at PG, really all over and Dieng gives another option even when Okongwu comes back.  A little less Solo, a little more Jalen Johnson please, especially if we're playing bad teams.  Long term - wondering what Reddish/Galinari trade package could get us...."
"I’m sorry, but one game into the season isn’t enough to say this is a poor version of shooters around Luka. THJ was one of the best shooters in the NBA last year. DFS and maxi are experts at hitting corner 3’s, KP stretches the floor, and we replaced James Johnson and Josh richardson with Bullock and Brown who both shot better than 40% on 3 on more than 10 attempts a game combined.   Like, is this a championship roster? No. But Luka/THJ/bullock/DFS/KP  With Jalen/brown/green/maxi/Dwight off the bench, that’s a great shooting starting lineup. You can criticize interior defense and playmaking, but we have shooting."
The hawks are absolutely loaded. Wait till Jalen Johnson gets going and Lou Will is healthy
"We about to sweep all the awards. Trae MVP, Reddish 6MOTY, Hunter DPOY and MIP, Jalen Johnson ROTY"
Jalen Johnson &gt; Luka
Getting Jalen Johnson was a HUGE steal for Hawks. They are going to be scary deep in a few years if they aren’t already.
Hawks are basically playing with house money with Jalen Johnson
Jalen Johnson? Ok!!
Jalen Johnson has a 100% career shooting percentage.  The top 75 came out a few days too early
JALEN JOHNSON ALREADY THE GREATEST BASKETBALL PLAYER OF ALL TIME?
JALEN JOHNSON ROY
A reminder that Jalen Johnson is only 19
MVP: Embiid  ROTY: Jalen Green  6MOY: D-Rose  MIP: Keldon Johnson  COTY: Steve Nash
We’re gonna have the best bench in the league.   CP3/cam Payne/Elfrid Payton   Booker/shamet  Mikal bridges/cam Johnson  Jae crowder / cam Johnson /jalen smith  Ayton / jevale McGee / Frank kaminsky
So deep we probably won’t get to see much from Jalen Johnson or Sharife Cooper outside of the g-league 😢
"Jalen Johnson is someone I think could be a great rotational player.   6’8 athletic wing with gigantic hands and a 7’0 wingspan. Known for having an above the rim game and being a decent passer. This was someone the Raptors took in to take a look at as well, which makes sense considering he has a super similar skill set to Barnes.   While he has some question marks about his game, he got drafted to the Hawks which I think could be a great fit for him. He was averaging 20/10/2/1/1 in the summer league, and with the Hawks he should be able to come in and focus on being an athletic wing and potentially unlocking some of his playmaking. His shooting is his biggest concern/question mark and what will determine his ceiling but overall I feel like he was not talked about a lot."
MVP- Trae Young  MIP-Keldon Johnson  DPOY-Anthony Davis   6MOY-NAW  ROY- Jalen Green
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
Dieng and Collins probably cover the 5 if Capela misses time. Maybe even some small ball with Jalen Johnson or Gallinari there.
"Payne, Shamet, Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith and McGee is pretty damn solid. Playmaking, decent to good defenders at every position, shooting. Only weak spot is Smith, he looked good yesterday but still holding out hope we can upgrade that backup PF spot sometime this season"
"I know im a hawks fan but I think we might take the cake.  Our 2nd unit will be some combo of:  PG: Delon Wright/lou Williams  SG: Kevin huerter  SF: Cam Reddish  PF: Gallo  C: OO/Gorgui Deing  Then we have Jalen johnson, Solomon hill and sharife cooper to back those guys up"
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9’0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn’t as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6’1.25 H, 8’1 SR), Keon Johnson (6’3.5 height, 8’1 SR), Jericho Simms (6’9 H, 8’10 SR), Jalen Harris (6’2.75 H - 8’1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6’10 H, 9’1 SR), Tyler Bey(6’6 H, 8’9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."
"Bruh the Hawks 8 best players played 3 minutes the entire season. Trae's team was never healthy to begin with the entire year. Now Bogy is a reliable shot creator, reliable 3 point shooter, Collins is actually a post-up face up typa guy player, Capela once in a while can create his hook shots. Hunter would actually take advantage of his height in mismatches, you know what huerter did in game 7 against the 76ers. plus gallo and lou will with young guys in jalen johnson, and shariffe.  You really think our whole offense is reliant only on Trae. Also due to size, Lavine is obviously more efficient. You cannot compare a 6'6 guard to a 6'0 guard through efficiency too be honest.  and sure let's say lonzo would actually make trae earn his baskets more, collins is gonna take advantage in the post against pwill/derozan, while hunter could easily isolate derozan. yes i do think hunter's iso game is underrated as people only know him through a 23 game sample  You act like the Hawks team ain't deep, in fact they are easily deeper than the Bulls, have a better core imho. Troy Brown Jr will literally not get PT from us, Tony Bradley would probably be cut from is.  The games might get closer, but on paper (as we haven't really see the Bulls do something during the actual season) the Hawks would defeat the Bulls"
"Bench mob is gonna go crazy. Everyone from Payne, Cam Johnson, Shamet, Javale were in their bag. Even Jalen Smith was doing the ""garbage guy"" things, and if he continues to do those things we won't miss Torrey Craig's impact that much.  I see us struggling a lot trying to match teams that shoot well from 3. If we get caught in a shootout it's very unlikely we'll match a shootout against Golden State, Brooklyn, Utah. But I trust the defense to make adjustments because we were one of the better 3 pt defending teams in the league last season."
Jalen Johnson will be considered the steal of this draft
"WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT BARNES! We could’ve resigned he and KP and just been over the cap then trotted out Luka/THJ/DFS/Barnes/KP with Jalen, maxi, Dwight Powell etc off the bench. I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
We got another John Collins in training too. Jalen Johnson will be annihilating rims soon as well
"Lmao you were wrong in almost everything you said  &gt;Jared Allen  Think you meant Jarrett Allen, unless you are indeed talking about the former Viking's defensive end  &gt;Similar stats  Ayton is leaps and bounds a better offensive player. Last year was his lowest PPG at 14.4, compared to Allen who has never cracked 13 PPG in a season. 2 years ago Ayton was over 18. And he was at 15.8 in the playoffs. His advanced stats last year are also better than Allen's.  &gt;8-10 mill better is a pretty decent role player that you'd lose  That's not really how you can look at cap space unless teams are under the cap, which the Suns are not ($128M in active contracts right per Spotrac). Signing him with Bird rights doesn't really mean you lose out on the extra cap space he's taking up. It means the owner has to spend more, but since the Suns will be over the cap it doesn't mean if they give him $20M/year instead of $30M/year that they have an extra $10M/year in free agency. Also, they have their team's core really locked up and set for the next few years anyway. Booker-Paul-Crowder-Saric-Payne-Johnson are all locked up through 22-23 at the earliest, with Ayton-Bridges-Shamet all RFAs. That's a pretty set top-9, not even considering if someone like Jalen Smith pan out.  &gt;small market where money matters to sign guys  Phoenix is not a small market. With CP3 there, and after their performance last year, they should have no problem getting ring chasers if they have another good showing in the playoffs this year. Phoenix is a good NBA city - not first tier like LA, NYC, or MIA, but definitely a 2nd tier NBA city with places like Houston. They've struggled to sign guys in the past because of their ownership and how bad they've been, not because of their location."
"&gt;Greenberg will be joined by Stephen A. Smith, Michael Wilbon, Jalen Rose and Magic Johnson for the biggest games, sources said."
"Aside from the starting 5, I want to see a switch everything lineup at some point with Wright/Huerter/Reddish/ Hunter/ OO. Could even have Jalen Johnson instead of Wright to have everyone 6’7” to 6’9”"
"If he’s healthy he’s so good. I wanted him with our first pick even with Jalen Johnson on the board. He’s gotta a sick handle, true jumpshot, and can facilitate at a good rate. Extremely strong offensive prospect. Happy with the value we got a way with but I can see Butler shining"
Also okungwu when he gets healthy and jalen johnson looked really promising in the summer league.
"I know we have a deep roster and are looking to win more than develop, but I really hope the staff are not singling out the rookies and red-shirts to play harder for a roster spot. I know there's not a rush to get Mays, Sharife, and Jalen out there, but I hope we're seeing them as important assets in the future. Cooper and Johnson especially."
"I read this as Jaren Jackson Jr and I got flash-backs. I don't know how much of a run Jalen Johnson was going to get behind the Hawks' disgusting amount of young forwards, but hope it's not serious."
"Jalen Johnson.   5 star recruit that went to Duke. Got hurt and then left Duke early to focus on the draft. The guy is 6’8, long arms and huge hands. Has good athleticism and has shown flashes in the NCAA of excellence. Got drafted 20th to the Hawks.  Overall he is a bit of a project, has good size, and seems to be able to rebound and defend decently, just needs to develop his offensive game more. Currently is a poor shooter, and has the potential to expand on his passing ability but would likely need to be a better ball handler/offensive threat in order to utilize his playmaking."
"Huerter's better than Cam and doesn't have the injury concerns that Cam does. We already got another project wing in Jalen Johnson, so I don't really see the reason to keep Cam unless he shows significant growth this year."
Jalen Johnson will probably be called up
They might as well bring up Jalen Johnson at this point.
"I wouldn’t take grant or wood, but if Barnes is available and we can get him for Cam Johnson, saric, jalen smith and picks id do it."
"I feel like giving Jalen Johnson minutes can't be worse than Hill and TLC getting them, honestly.   And realistically I'm not sure how giving Cooper a shot can be much worse than Delon Wright and Lou Williams have been so far this year.  That's not to say that you don't want to get your vets right by the playoffs, but these young guys have to be options too.    People love to give Thibs shit for relying too much on the starters and not liking rookies, but he played Obi and IQ big minutes last year, and when we've been missing guys this year he's had no hesitation putting Jericho Sims and Quentin Grimes into games."
I would rather see Jalen Johnson than TLC or hill
Just brutal from Gallo tonight. Might need some sporadic jalen Johnson appearances this year.
I'd love to see Jalen Johnson get some non-garbage time minutes now that Cam is out too. Maybe with Collins as small ball five
Even tho I'ma spurs fan and would hate it y'all should try for either Murray or primo form us or go for clay and trade capella for him with picks and pieces and put Collins at the five run Jalen Johnson at the four and y'all are finals bound
"&gt; The 2018 Rockets are the greatest team to never win a title, I’ve gone back and watched some games from them and the Harden+CP backcourt is on the same level as Curry+Klay IMO  Hard disagree.  Prime Nash/Amare/Marion/Barbosa/Diaw/.  Throw in Jalen Rose, Kurt Thomas, James Jones, Raja Bell.  Guy went to jail for fixing games against us vs the Spurs multiple times.  We were the best team in the league, everybody knew it.  Throw in Prime Barkley/KJ/Majerle/Danny Ainge losing the prime Jordan Bulls thanks to a last second three by Paxson.  Kevin Johnson probably the most under rated PG in history.  He had several 20/10 seasons.  Which at the time was unheard of.  Barkley won league MVP and the Suns had a better record than the Bulls that year."
"Book DA CP3 The Warden Crowder Johnson Payne Shamet.   I feel like the only players they'd be interested in is either Saric, or Jalen Smith."
"I agree with this, but since this hypothetical expansion is happening this summer, hawks would let either Kevin or Cam go and keep Jalen Johnson."
"Yeah, late lottery picks aren't really high value so I wouldn't be too mad about this pick but there's a reason people take swings at high-ceiling wings around that range, a hit is so much more valuable than a rotation guard. Sengun, Moody and Jalen Johnson were the realistic picks they could have gone with there instead."
Jalen Johnson
"LeBron for bridges, ayton, Jalen Smith and 2 firsts (plus filler)?  Cp3, book, cam Johnson, Bron, mcgee  With bench of Payne, shamet, Nader, kaminsky  I think Lakers get better too crazily.  If I were sun's, I'd turn it down tho"
"Is there any possible way that the Suns can get Wood?  *Maybe a Cam Johnson + 1st + 2nd (throw in Jalen Smith too, because why not)*"
"He was really bad at Kentucky in a lot of ways, but no-one thought he drop *that* far. This was a really weird draft in that respect, when guys dropped they *really* dropped.  Jared Butler, Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper, BJ Boston, Keon Johnson, Cam Thomas all absolutely dropped and managed to find themselves of high caliber playoff teams which is pretty wild considering their talent level. If they went lottery/top 10 in another (weaker) draft it wouldn't have surprised me."
"Man, I need me some Sharife lobs to Jalen Johnson to heal my soul."
"We were starting Malachi Flynn, Jalen Harris, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson Jr  didn’t really miss them if we weren’t trying to make them"
"The Hawks have so many young forwards with very high potential. Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Jalen Johnson. I doubt you can develop all those guys while also having John Collins"
"everything. absolutely everything. coaching, players making boneheaded decisions, stars not showing up at first, now role players not showing up, sending Jalen Johnson and sharife Cooper to the g league and proceeding to start Solomon Hill and having to give TLC actual rotation minutes."
Everyone got paid and stopped caring.  Nate is starting Solomon Hill while Jalen Johnson is in the G-League.  Capela is Charmin Soft.
"wtf why were they brining in jalen johnson, dude was far from our range"
"&gt;Basically the man couldn’t shoot. He had the worst shooting drill out of all 1-on-0 workouts. Just was totally flat. It was so bad and he was so worked up about it that they called the workout short and told him to come back the next day, even though they already had another guy coming in the next day (jalen johnson). That basically never happens. Didn’t do great on the second chance either."
"Take it with a grain of salt, but here's a comment from an ""insider"" on /r/torontoraptors about his workout:  &gt;Basically the man couldn’t shoot. He had the worst shooting drill out of all 1-on-0 workouts (they worked out about 10, including Bouknight who said he didn’t work out with us for some reason?? Bouknight had the best shooting drill of all by far).  &gt;Just was totally flat. It was so bad and he was so worked up about it that they called the workout short and told him to come back the next day, deven though they already had another guy coming in the next day (jalen johnson).  &gt;That basically never happens. Didn’t do great on the second chance either.  &gt;Scottie killed it. Beginning to end. Great workout, charmed them with his personality, shot the leather off the ball. They just loved him.  &gt;I didn’t want to say anything about the bad workout bc I didn’t want that to get out, in case the FO was trying to trade the pick.  https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/ouc3dj/they_booed_him_for_speaking_the_truth/h72tae3/"
"I personally had Barnes in the next tier down with Moody, Jalen Johnson, Springer, Keon, Sengun, and Wagner.  I thought he was clearly one of the best and most versatile defenders in the draft and had clear elite athleticism, but his lack of a J in college and not having the latitude to be a point forward in the NBA opened up a ton of massive question marks for me.  His multidimensionality in the NBA has been the most surprising thing for me, and I did not think he'd be as good of a scorer as he has been.  Though I'm always curious on how much the summer development played in that considering the Raps have one of the best development teams in the NBA. Like, if they drafted Suggs instead would we be talking this way about Suggs while Barnes struggles on the Magic because playing under the Raps org seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy?"
"Same thing that happened to Kuminga, Moody, Jalen Johnson, Cooper, Springer, and all of the other 19 year olds on teams trying to maximize their competitiveness right now. Buried at the end of the bench.  It's more of a commentary on the Nets than Thomas, I wouldn't read anything into it about him being a bust or whatever."
"Yeah, I don't think we're the best when it comes to drafting, blew josh Jackson's pick, ayton's was obvious (without the hindsight of luka), I believe we lucked out with cam johnson and Jalen is a bust."
Put me down for Jalen Johnson
Give the kid a chance. We haven’t seen enough for Bust talk yet. But wow Jalen Green is already amazing. The Pistons always pick the wrong guy. Detroit took Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell.
"think of all the players who haven’t seen much action: cade, bouknight, kuminga, cam, deuce, sharife, jared butler, quentin grimes, primo, moody, jalen johnson.   some of those guys are gonna be big contributors in 2 seasons."
"If the Celtics are 12th seed or lower, I could see them trading Brown to a Western Conference team for tons of picks and salary filler.  That being said...  Gallinari, Huerter, Jalen Johnson and a few pick swaps for Brown?"
"That face when Alex Len is 100x more valuable than the 4 other top-10 picks (Jalen Smith \[10\], Josh Jackson \[4\], Dragan Bender \[4\], Marquese Chriss \[7\]) in the past 15 years the Suns have had combined.  Apparently the Suns just need to draft in the low-teens from now on.  * Cam Johnson -- 11th pick 2019 * Devin Booker -- 13th pick 2015 * TJ Warren -- 14th pick 2014 * Kendall Marshall -- 13th pick 2012  (Fucking eww, never knew why we did this) * Markieff Morris -- 13th pick 2011 (Even with him being a dickhead, he's still a serviceable NBA player) * Earl Clark -- 14th pick 2009 (We held out hope for so long on him) * Robin Lopez -- 15th pick 2008 (We bitched about him so much until we lost him and had Len as a starter, who we bitched about until we lost him and had continuous garbage as starters until Ayton)"
"Normally I hate these kinds of comments, because they're like ""LOL x team took y player over Kawhi!!?!?""  ...but this one? Yeah, this definitely seemed to be the consensus pick. Along with several others like Vassell, Kira Lewis, Cole Anthony, Saddiq Bey...  The only defense going for this (and the reason why I've defended Jalen Smith so much) is the Cam Johnson pick that worked out so well. I nearly threw my hat in the trash when I saw his name come up in the draft and told myself that I won't be so quick to judge moving forward -- if this becomes a pattern though, then we'll have to see."
"Schlenk has drafted some great wing players in Hunter, Reddish, and hopefully Jalen Johnson. Definitely someone who knows how to amplify a star player in Trae."
"2017 - John Collins  2018 - Trae Young, Kevin Huerter  2019 - Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish  2020 - Onyeka Okongwu  2021 - Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously I'm biased but I'd say the Hawks have drafted better. Every single one of the guys on this list has starter level upside (if they haven't realized it yet) and are going to cause a money squeeze on the Hawks because of how good they all are. The Grizz probably have picked guys better equipped to be rotation and role guys but the Hawks seem to have a lot of guys who would be on a lot of team's starting lineups"
Jalen Johnson did pretty much the same and went too 20 so i wouldn't say this is too high m the other options theoretically aren't much better
Hawks taking him and Jalen Johnson after slides? Sexy ass draft for them
Hawks really got Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper. Basketball Gods love Atlanta.
"Coulda had  Giddey,sengun, Jalen Johnson, and it Thor."
Where the fuck did I ever say Hawks want Jalen Johnson to be a scorer? What kind of strawman argument are you pullling out of your ass boi?
"Look, it's fair to be like ""hey guys let's lay off Jalen Johnson we don't know what factored into all that"". I totally get it, and I'm not gonna bash on him.  I just think it's disingenuous to compare it to Simone Biles. You're comparing a question that has an answer vs. a question that doesn't have an answer"
"I can. Popovich coaches coachable, respectful, intelligent guys. Jalen Johnson is a spoiled quitter with insane athleticism."
Jalen Johnson already threepeated by quitting on three teams already
"Fuck Duke,   But fuck Jalen Johnson more for disrespecting Coach K who was trying to be the first person to enforce rules and say No to him"
"He quit playing at Duke after Coach K made comments that Jalen Johnson needs to hustle more. He was by all accounts a toxic teammate who doesn’t seem to have developed any skills, rather rely on his athleticism to get through everything."
I’m really high on Jalen Johnson. He’s going to be one of the steals of this draft. All star potential
"Gotta love how teams who are confident in their team and future seem to make the simplest, logical picks based on talent and the rich get richer. Warriors get Kuminga and Moody. Hawks get Jalen Johnson.   Meanwhile the kings take a 3rd PG, the magic take a FOURTH point guard, and the pacers draft a 25 year old"
"Jalen Johnson, nice. Hope he balls out for us. Time to read his scouting reports."
Jalen Johnson/ Cam Reddish fight for duke wing
"Jaylen Suggs, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Smith - all I got"
"""We don't know that the pick will be Jalen Johnson""  Yeah you did you liar"
That gender double standard is a mfer.    It’s taboo to question Simone Biles. But media feels no qualms about OPNELY questioning Jalen Johnson
"""We don't know if Jalen Johnson is the pick, it's just a coincidence that we're only talking about him and showing him on camera with a big smile."""
Rece Davis keeps saying he doesn’t know if Jalen Johnson is the pick when he knows for a fact he’s the pick
Jalen johnson can’t hide it hahaha he just got picked by atlanta
Jalen Johnson lmao
JALEN JOHNSON LFG
Hawks gonna take Jalen Johnson?
"One of them will be there for us at 19. Any two of Cam Thomas , jalen Johnson and Kai Jones would be great. Will be so sad if the Knicks pass on all 3"
"So I’m guessing the Jalen Johnson off-court concerns are pretty bad?  Was about to say “shouldn’t Trey Murphy be more highly regarded?” but then suddenly New Orleans* swipes him, lol.  Edit: whoops forgot about that trade"
Butler and Jalen Johnson
Would like maybe Jalen Johnson and Kai Jones to fall to the Knicks.
"How in the hell are Moody, Sengun, &amp; Jalen Johnson all still on the board?!"
If Jalen Johnson goes to the Warriors at 14 that team will be unbelievably stacked. I’ll bandwagon them.
Pop gonna get Jalen Johnson isn't he
I’m betting Jalen johnson   Just seems like a hornets pick.
Wouldn’t be shocked if Zaire or Jalen Johnson end up as one of the best players in the draft.  Memphis deserves benefit of the doubt they have been nailing picks recently.
Ja JJJ and Jalen Johnson
Jalen Johnson could be interesting on the magic
"I think the Magic will go for a big wing, Jalen Johnson is my guess"
Jalen Johnson. He’s going to have a long and successful NBA career and will be a steal of the draft.
Jalen Johnson tbh. Think he’s something special
"1) Jalen Green 2) Jalen Suggs 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Johnathan Kuminga 5) Ziaire Williams 6) Evan Mobley 7) Jalen Johnson 8) Alperun Sengun 9) Josh Christopher 10) James Bouknight/Joshua Primo  I think this is a crazy deep Draft but kinda top heavy with Bust Potential. Not to say all those guys will Bust just that they could, so I'll bet on these guys."
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor

Scottie Barnes    Obviously some 2nd rounder is going to crash the party but I think all 10 of those guys are in great places to be high floor high ceiling.

"Unless Jalen Johnson somehow falls to us, I'd love to take a flier on Wieskamp at #26. If he doesn't work out, it's only #26, and the upside is definitely there. Will likely fall later though."
Star: Jalen Green   Bust: Jalen Johnson   Steal: Jaden Springer
"jalen johnson won’t fall that far, i like sharife cooper or tre mann on the rockets though"
Jalen Johnson is nothing like Cade?
"If we traded down and ended up with some combo of Zaire/Jalen Johnson and Garuba/Kai/Day'Ron, we'd be ecstatic"
6 Bouknight  Trade 16+18 up to 9 or 11 for Moody  If not able to trade then:  Jalen Johnson at 16  Usman Garuba at 18  Vrenz Bleijenbergh at 34  Quentin Grimes at 36
"Tre Mann, Jaden Springer, Jalen Johnson (if he falls that far) would be good at that 24 spot."
"Usman Garuba will be one of the best defenders in the league one day, barring a crazy injury or similar.  I also think Jalen Johnson will be a steal."
Seriously I'd much rather take this than Kai Jones or Jalen Johnson
"if this doesn't happen then I want Sengun. otherwise, shit, if we get him and whichever of Jalen Johnson or Ziaire that's left, I'm stoked. maximum potential and Reddish is exactly what we need, a 3/4 with good defense, passing, and plenty of potential.   this would be magical. if we do this and S&amp;T DeMar for Kuz and whoever at 22, I'm just gonna start screaming. this is the NBA, there's no reason the Lakers and Spurs cant do an under the table handshake deal where they take who we want and we send them DeMar when FA opens."
I agree Jalen Johnson can play and his stock has fallen
"Not sure if this qualifies bit Jalen Johnson slipping blows my mind, that kid can play."
I think first surprise is going to be Jaden Springer. I could see Jalen Johnson sliding.
"Clarke doesn't even fit the TPE. Warriors would have to throw in players to get him, while Bane fits the TPE (2.5 mil + 100k). The problem with Bane is that the Warriors are super crowded in the backcourt already. They only do this if they don't plan to draft Moody/Bouknight/Duarte or think its a big upgrade from Lee. On paper, it's a nice move, but in the Warriors' context, you'd want a vet to fill that spot. Though getting Wagner with the 10th and like Ziaire Williams/Jalen Johnson at 14 would be really cool."

"it's like we started jalen harris, paul watson and stanley johnson"
"Javale McGee, and the Martin twins. Bring back Luke Babbit and Armon Johnson, and that’s a SQUAD!   I would have said Jalen Harris, but ya know..."
"In terms of guys who I'd trade up for or pray they fall in the draft, it'd be Jalen Johnson 100%. For someone who will definitely be available, I like Joe Wieskamp from Iowa; this seems like the kind of pick that might not age well, but he's got good size, speed, and was a 3-pt sniper in college. But he's not just a one-dimensional player either, he gets involved on both ends. I hate to curse it, but he's *almost* ^(Duncan Robinson-like.) Nuggets could use that skillset if he pans out, if not, no biggie, it's just the 26th pick."
Doesn't seem like they would've had to move all the way up to 10 for Jalen Johnson. There's a reasonable chance he would've been there at 17.
Jalen Johnson would be an intriguing fit there
"Jalen Johnson is a great prospect on paper but reporters are saying that he’s falling due to his background, similar to what happened to Mcdaniels last year or KPJ the year before."
"Am I the only one that thinks this is a steal for Memphis?   This allows them to play JJJ at his natural position. Gives them the ability to draft a great wing like Franz Wagner or Jalen Johnson and Adams is only a marginal downgrade from Valanciunas.   Lakers first rounder is likely to be a late first, but Memphis has shown a great eye for finding talent too."
"The Suns  CP3/Booker/Bridges/Crowder/Kaminsky   Bench: Cam Payne, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  Obviously Kaminsky is less than ideal, but Saric and Ayton aren’t American unfortunately"
Jalen Johnson seems like a better fit
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"It’s likely Collins is retained and I’d be surprised if Reddish is dealt…if Hunter is healthy (which is a big if) Huerter is firmly in a bench role.   Now if Hunter isn’t healthy long term, this wouldn’t be a bad draft to take a swing at 3/D guy like Trey Murphy (would likely have to move into the back end of the lottery for him) or take the pure upside pick in Jalen Johnson. We shouldn’t be trying to log Kevin at the 3 when he’s at his best using his size against smaller guards. Seth Curry will tell you that."
"Michigan would be good:  **Starters**: Monte Morris - Devin Booker - Miles Bridges - Draymond Green - Javale McGee  **Bench:** Bryn Forbes, Edmond Sumner, Denzel Valentine, Josh Jackson  **Coach:** Magic Johnson  **Cheerleader:** Jalen Rose  **Water boy:** Kyle Kuzma"
"Ok then, look at the top of this draft, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson, and Evan Mobley are all good-to-great passers."
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"I didn't even think it was open at any point in the last 6 months until the last few weeks.  In order for that team to realistically compete moving forward, they've got to hope Chris Paul continues to age like fine wine and that at least one of their young guys makes a leap.  I think Booker is who he is at this point, so you're hoping for development from Ayton or Jalen Smith.  Bridges and Cam Johnson are both older than Booker, so I don't think there's all that much more ceiling left for them."
If you're docking Wiseman for a disappointing rookie season why are you not docking  Kuminga for being disappointing in the G League or Jalen Johnson in college? Wiseman has a higher ceiling than anyone outside of the top 4 + Kuminga and that's the most important thing in a prospect.  He would definitely even after his rookie season be in the conversion for #7 and wouldn't go lower than 10.

The Best wings out of this draft will be Trey Murphy III and Jalen Johnson.
"Cade Cunningham will be a role player.  Evan Mobley will be the best player in the draft, with Jalen Green a close second.  Kuminga, Wagner, and Keon Johnson will bust hard."
"That's what the numbers say from our poll about who to draft. Go look for yourself. Bouknight had the most votes of the guys remaining at 7 in this mock, and Jalen Johnson had the most votes of guys remaining at 14"
"I took this data from our poll about who to draft at 7th overall. Of the options, Bouknight was the highest available at 7 and Jalen Johnson at 14"
"We need a legit backup for Ayton, especially with Saric out next season. We already needed one, now it's even more crucial. We also hope Jalen Smith, with some development time and camp, turns out. We're likely to at least attempt to re-sign CP3, though the jury is out on what the fanbase thinks of that after this series.  Aside from that, work on improving Mikal and Ayton's game. Despite what anyone says about our luck this postseason, we have a very solid core of those two with Booker and Cam Johnson. We've also still got Crowder for two years."
