"Nobody is arguing that Kyrie isn't a special offensive player. Steph managed all that while shooting more 3's and playing a part of the game called ""defense"" that seems quite alien to Mr. Irving."
"2021 Steph Curry:  28.2/5.7/6.1, 41.4% from 3, .633 TS%   2021 Kyrie Irving:  28.3/4.8/5.7, 45.4% from 3, .647 TS%  Irving is not playing as well as 2016 Curry, he’s statistically playing as well as 2021 Curry."
Kyrie “Kevin “The servant” Durant” Irving
"Kyrie Irving, CP3 ,Allen Iverson, Rajon Rondo, etc. are all average height and yet they still dominated the league. Height clearly isn’t the issue."
"&gt;2 Remaining Spots between Trae Young, Tobias Harris, Malcolm Brogden, Gordon Hayward, Jrue Holliday, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Zach LaVine &amp; Collin Sexton.  Brutal how do you even pick?"
I think they'd be better. You can't build a wall when James Harden and Kyrie Irving are on the floor.
"The definition of all time great is confusing in this thread.  Bosh and Klay are... but NOT Kyrie?  Kyrie is a crazy twat... but the dude can ball.  He's stupid efficient, especially for his position.  Low TO rate for his usage.  Has great handles... creates his own shot.  While he's not a shut down defender his defense, for his position, has never come into question.  Yeah he's no KD or Harden.  He's no LeBron or Jordan.  He's no Kobe or Robertson.  But if Klay or Bosh are making the 'all time' list, implied if not expressed through the 'big 3' sentiment ... Irving has got to be on there to."

Kyrie Irving is without a doubt a top 3 PG in the league.
That’s basketball genius Kyrie Irving fam
"All-stars Kevin Durant, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Nicolas Batum"
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"Kyrie and Harden are super established and in Brooklyn so they could pretty easily take the fan voting. Trae is also incredibly popular and I could see him stealing the fan vote from Kyrie. After those 3 I'd say they only challenger is Beal, but his suck ass Wizards aren't winning. Boston hasn't been great but they're undeniably a playoff presence. Worst case scenario I'd say Brown gets in as a coaches pick. Either Irving and Harden get voted in and Brown is the 2nd coaches pick behind Young, or Young gets that starters vote and I think Brown may even get the coaches vote ahead of Kyrie."

That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance.

You could 100% tell he was not digging it when he switched onto Irving on the left-wing only for Kyrie to pass it to KD at the top of the key with Batum on him. BBQ chicken
Clippers genuinely needed Pat Bev to at least slow Kyrie Irving down somewhat.
"Greatest Big 3 of all time. They will get their damn respect in July. Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving are the underrated trio."

"Nets Big 4: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Tyson Fury."
"Let it really sink in for a sec.   The league seriously let the Nets get away with signing Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  **What the *fuck* were we all thinking?**"
"  Imagine Kevin Durant getting hot. You have to focus on him. Then there’s James Harden, one of the greatest scorers of all time. You have to focus on him. Kyrie Irving, one of the most efficient players of all time. You have to focus on him too. Then, that’s not even the end. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the league. You have to focus on him. And then there’s, Jeff Green. He’s not gonna do anything, right??? Other than shoot over 45% from 3......  This Nets team might be as good as the 2017 Warriors."
"Nets Big 4: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Tyson Fury."
Kyrie. Irving.
I LOV KYRIE IRVING
"Very few things sound better than Ian Eagle saying ""Kyrie Irving!"""
"Thank fuck Kyrie Irving didn't actually retire, what a player."
Kyrie Irving is a fucking Picasso of basketball. Like bro I am so wet right now.
"Kyrie Irving is a cheat code when he's hot, man."
Kyrie fucking Irving
Only Kyrie Irving can stop Kyrie Irving.
True or false: Kyrie Irving is the most SKILLED player of all time.
"Kyrie Irving is SO talented man. I really hope he focusses on Ball again, he's got the chance to create something special in Brooklyn with KD and Harden. If he'd get it together mentally and stop saying stupid shit that damages the team morale he could be considered a clear-cut Superstar, perennial Top10-Top7 level player. Instead he just plays like one and i's a bit frustrating since he's got everything it needs to dominate and more."
This game is a lot of attack Reggie Jackson and attack Kyrie Irving going on by each team
"It really just hit me that the league let the Nets get away with signing Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  What the fuck were we all thinking."
"I like the offense when it goes through Harden more than when it goes through Irving.  It seems to move more.  But man, Kyrie is ridiculous in iso."
I'm Australian and I didn't know either. Turns out to be a Kyrie Irving situation except he was born in the us to non Australian parents and then lived in Australia for a few years.
foolish of us to not be able to predict the classic Bogdanovic Avulsion tear and of course the Kyrie irving falling into Gallinari's leg
"Wrong.  Top 10 in order and if you disagree you’re wrong.  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić"
The Brooklyn Nets by double digits. The Brooklyn Nets are 5-0 in National TV games  (excluding NBA TV games) this season. Only the the Milwaukee Bucks game has been close and that’s only because it was James Harden second game with the team and Kyrie Irving was out.
"You know they say all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at James Harden you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another baller you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal! So you got a 25 percent at best at beat me! And then you add Kyrie Irving to the mix? You-the chances of winning drastically go down. See, the 3-Way in Brooklyn, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning. But I! I got a 66 and two thirds chance of winning, cuz Kyrie KNOOOWS he can't beat me, and he's not even gonna try. So, James Harden you take your thirty three and a third chance minus my twenty five percent chance (if we was to go one on one) and you got an eight and a third chance of winning the NBA Finals. But then you take my 75 perchance-chance of winnin' (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 and two thirds…percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning the NBA finals! Señor Harden! The numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you this NBA season."
Coaches vote for the reserves. I don’t think there is any chance they would vote in Kyrie Irving after all the shit he pulled earlier. For reserves you have to think like a coach
I think Lebron James and Kyrie Irving both going nuclear in the finals cost them a chip much more than any trash talking did
"Against teams over .500 the Brooklyn Nets have an ORTG that would be 2nd in the NBA &amp; a DRTG that would sit 12th.  The 7.88 Net Rating would rank 1st.  Confirms that BK’s struggles on D are largely effort based. Like Kyrie Irving &amp; James Harden, BK only defends against good teams"
Randal is so good now that i traded kyrie irving for him in fantasy

I remember some of my Celtic fan friends bashing Kyrie Irving to me when he went to Brooklyn and making sure I knew that he would destroy the Nets in a similar fashion. Claiming Kemba Walker was the missing piece.   The rest is history...
Kyrie irving for jrue holiday who says no
"What do you guys think of trading Draymond green + any other asset for Kyrie Irving. I know its a crazy trade, Nets need defense and Warriors require someone who can complement steph scoring"
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are only 5 miles away lmao"
Kyrie Irving
"Ish ""Kyrie Irving"" smith"
"Kyrie was injured for most of the year, Jesus do you even follow the sport, of course he wasn’t all nba in 15-16. Irving averaged 27p on amazing splits in the nba finals, it’s not really debatable that he was a top 15 player."
It’s not implying when you state it outright.  Kyrie Irving was injured for half that season so of course he didn’t make an all nba team. Kevin Love sacrificed all his stats when he joined the cavs he averaged 26 and 13 the year before he joined the Cavs and 20 and 12 for his entire Minnesota run he was a top 15 guy.   Wade was better than Bron in the Dallas finals and was still a top player in following year even as he was declining.
I can see Kyrie Irving or Jeff Green becoming coaches in the future.
"Bro, if you took the 2 best players from every team, Kyrie Irving would be the best point guard in the NBA. Simmons, Kyrie, Kemba, Conley would probably be the best 4 point guards in the NBA (in this scenario)."
Dude the Vegas shooting was over in 5 fucking seconds once something more exciting happened.....Kyrie Irving same shit lol I dont even think people talked about the Tennessee bombing for more then 24 hours
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don’t care if he’s struggling in the regular season. He’s a playoff monster.

"Yes, trade Curry for a nice young asset like Kyrie Irving and Draymond for a future all star in Perry. That team would be solid."
"You brought up Trae Young and his record last year. Kemba Walker was also an Eastern Conference starter. That’s a dumb argument. Were there Eastern Conference players last year playing as well as Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown? That were winning games as well?  The Kyrie Irving hate is unreal on this sub. I’m not even going to vote and Kyrie Irving and James Harden will easily be named Eastern Conference All Star starters. They deserve it too, unlike the overrated player that wanted to be in Washington and has the worst record in the NBA."
Why would Bradley Beal start? Bradley Beal is so overrated. He might not even be a top 20 player in the league.   Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown deserve to start over Bradley Beal. They’ve both been better and have been winning games.
"The Brooklyn Nets Big 3 is the greatest trio of all time. Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving is just unfair."
I like those guys in Brooklyn but Harden just got to the East and Kyrie missed a few games too. I also think it's highly unlikely we'll see three starters from Brooklyn and KD is the only one I'd argue is 100% starting but I can see why Harden and Irving would get votes due to fan vote.
"Lol it won't be championship caliber when the alleged point guards starts fucking up the spacing for everyone by sitting in the dunker's spot. Both prospective Western Conference opponents (Lakers, Clippers) would have the best player in the series and so would Milwaukee.

Embiid is 7ft 280lbs it’s not like he’s Kyrie Irving ffs. I guess Lebron should’ve just got dunked on.

"Kyrie irving, best passer? Lol."
Kevin Love is the most overrated 3rd option of all time. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were by far the best duo in the NBA in 2016.   I want Bradley Beal to end up on the Los Angeles Lakers. It would make the Los Angeles Lakers a lock to make the NBA Finals and the Finals would be competitive.
Did Lebron James give Kyrie Irving his third eye?
"It says ""underrated performances."" I'm not surprised when Kyrie Irving has a good game because he is good..."
"No mention of Kyrie Irving, but he was better than half the players you named. The Kyrie Irving hate is unreal."
I’m Kyrie Irving AMA!!!
Celtics Legend Kyrie Irving
I swear r/nba thinks Kyrie Irving is a role player
"Tough decision my ass  KD, Harden, kyrie irving   Im glad Raptors have a ring so i dont have to watch this joke of league that closely anymore"
"Do you have a Lebron boner or something?   Lebron did NOT singlehandedly beat the Warriors he had All-Star guard Kyrie Irving dropped 40 with him in game 5, Draymond green get suspended and a lot of pieces had to fall perfectly for the Cavs to pull that off, it was impressive nevertheless. KD in the year he won MVP did NOT have better teammates than Lebron, Westbrook was out for half the season and KD singlehandedly led OKC to 59 wins which was the second best record in the league, Lebron was still on Miami with Wade and Bosh and they reached the Finals only to lose to SAS. Lebron has been the best player for 15 years but they was never a season were he was robbed of MVP which is a regular season award, since most of you Bron stans even claim he 'Coasts' in the regular season. Lebron should have won Unanimous MVP in 2013 but he didn't deserve DPOY of Gasol."
"When you need a little help getting Keven Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving over the top! You know between the 3 point shot being mastered and exploited analytics also player made super teams.

Kyrie Irving seems really interesting
"Imagine having to be a Brooklyn fan right now, what an absolutely embarrassing group of players put together.   Kevin ""Lemme just join the best team so I can check this box"" Durant  James ""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas, I give up"" Harden  Kyrie ""I'm an Actual Genius"" Irving  Blake ""Detriot?

"My bad it was from an espn article  Kyrie irving came to Standing Rock this week for the first time. He did not come for charity -- he gave the tribe $100,000 a year ago -- and he did not come for photo ops. The main event was sternly off limits to video or photography. He came to honor his mother and he came to understand his heritage. Irving didn't know his mother, Elizabeth, well. His parents separated when he was very young and she moved across the country before she passed away when Irving was just 4 years old.  For the past few years, Irving has been searching for himself a little. It's shown in some of his actions and some of his words. One of the most material ways was reaching and connecting to the Standing Rock Sioux, the tribe his mother was born into before she was adopted."

Asked if he believes the Earth is round Kyrie Irving says - ""That's a conversation that my hermetic brothers and I will have. ...Keep that to a private thing."""
"why the fuck are people trying to police whether Kyrie Irving is ""Native American enough"""
"I get why he's interested in it but he's so far from that environment.  Kyrie was born in Australia, raised in New Jersey. His mom died when he was 4. His mom was adopted when she was 9 days old. That's the Lakota connection.  But [going back](https://ethnicelebs.com/kyrie-irving-nationality) and it seems Kyrie is 19% Lakota going back to his great-great grandparents."
It's not fair. This is how Kyrie Irving plays regular basketball too.

"""*I would've won the 3 Point Contest.*"" - Kyrie Irving"
"&gt;The walking stick Kyrie Irving walked into the arena with is actually a Native American Prayer Stick, which is also sometimes referred to as a Spirit Stick or Medicine Stick. _Kyrie is 1/4 Lakota Sioux, and has made an effort to learn more about this part of his ancestry in the past few years. The Sioux tribe uses prayer sticks “to bless the tribe, and any animal prior to its use by the tribe. The holy man also uses the medicine stick to conjure spirits for the protection of warriors while hunting or during battle.” &gt;Kyrie has actually used the prayer stick previously and was filmed walking with one just yesterday before the game vs the Kings.   The relevance can be seen as Kyrie likening his teammates and basketball peers as either his tribe or his ""warriors."""
Do you not understand the chakras of Kyrie Irving? Things will work out.
Fuck Kyrie Irving
"Yeah I'm sure hearing Kyrie Irving prognosticating about some shit he knows nothing about would be awesome. The less I have to hear from this guy, the better."
that was 50 years ago. most of the anti-vax nutters are white. There is an overlap between anti-vaxxers and flat earthers plus people who think the moon landing was faked.   Do you really think that Kyrie Irving being nutters is related to what happened to black people 50 years ago?

"First of all, homie, it’s a joke. Second of all, was I supposed to let Kyrie Irving coming to my team change the fact that I’m from New Jersey? That the NJ nets were the first NBA game I went to? That I got cheap lower bowl tickets to barclays twice in 17/18? The fuck wrong with you boy"
you're replying to two consecutive 2021 nets flairs earnestly. You're assuming they're smarter than kyrie irving
"&gt; LaVine should be starting over Kyrie 100%  That's just bias, man  Irving (this season) has been only slightly a worse scorer than Lavine  He's better in every other aspect and his team is the top seed in his conference   You might be a fan of Lavine, but him starting over Kyrie is too much of a ""homer"" take"
He fan do that and still lose and get outgunned by kd/kyrie/and irving
"He did win. The NBA just gave Draymond a shadow suspension to give their face of the league, Kyrie Irving, a ring"
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are on that team  Whenever I’d say anything about Curry or Durant winning it it was always “well he has the other guy on his team he can’t win it” so explain why that just goes away now
He was ridiculous against the Bucks. I think he had one open layup. Everything else was some kind of circus shot or contested mid range.  When Murray is right he can be Kyrie Irving level hot. Only taking tough shots but they seem to go in 75% of the time.  Super streaky player but he's on a tear right now!
Some pairs that I can think of that haven’t been mentioned here yet:  LeBron and Horace Grant (03-04)  Kevin Durant and Sam Cassell (07-08)  Dwight Howard and Reggie Miller (04-05)  Kyrie Irving and Gilbert Arenas (11-12)
"The worst thing LeBron ever did was not commit to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Had he done so instead of sign one or two year contracts, we would have had the promise of some stability when recruiting free agents and coaches. Instead, the best we could ever do before 2015 was sign guys like Larry Hughes and Mo Williams. Had he stuck to his guns and said we’re playing for MY team, Dwyane Wade and either Bosh or Chris Paul would have joined instead of them going to miami and we sleepwalk the East for the next 15 years. The biggest question mark is whether we draft Kyrie Irving with the Clippers’ number one overall in 2011 and with Chris Paul and D Wade I don’t know that we do. At that point was the fo smart enough to avoid the mine field that separated 2 and 9? Best case scenario we draft Valanciunas as the heir apparent to Z but could have very well ended up with Derrick Williams, Enes Kanter, Jan Vesely, or Brandon Knight. On the other hand, maybe we look to add a sharp-shooting backup 2 guard with great defense and championship pedigree in Klay Thompson. Another question is whether David Griffen takes over the GM role? He made some brilliant moves that played a big part in our championship but would we have had a player like Kevin Love in 2015? Would his partnership with AD have started years earlier? Would peak Boogie Cousins or Lamarcus Aldridge have joined up? Would a real coach have come to Cleveland instead of the clown car of HCs we have had?  Safe to say he would have rings. Possible he would enjoy two long spells of consecutive championships broken up by a bad matchup here or there or its not outside the realm of possibility he wins a dozen or more rings"
and Marco Bellinelli and Paul Pierce and Kyrie Irving. (He shot over 43% from 3 in all these seasons)
"Jamal ""Kyrie Irving"" Murray. He really reminded me of Kyrie in the Bubble."
"Bro, America was an is a racist nation. The fact you think it’s outlandish for someone who’s native and black to be extremely critical of America is absurd. Trying to paint heroes and villains... the treatment and slavery of indigenous and black Americans is some of the most brutal behaviour in the entire world the last 500 years. America has not done nearly enough to make it right. Seriously look at what you’re defending and saying just so you can’t get mad at Kyrie.   As a person who has a black American dad and native mother and lived on a reservation and the south of america. What you’re saying is a joke. I guess I’m the real racist for criticizing America for being racist. What a joke  How far back it happened, lmao. My grandparents couldn’t go to school with white people. My parents are a mixed couple and technically weren’t allowed to marry in my dads home state.   So fucking butt hurt. He didn’t say white people, he said non disenfranchised Americans have and continue to treat black and native people bad at a systemic level poorly. Which is ducking true. Bro we have to listen to black and native communities be held responsible for all of each other everyday.   “Lose territories and land”. I can’t imagine someone with actual native heritage seriously saying something like this. It’s still happening to them to. America almost wiped out an entire culture and you’re mad it people don’t get over it.   This shit is exactly why people hate Americans. If you have more of an issue with Kyrie than you do with America and it’s continued actions then you’re a lost cause.   Kyrie mentions the brutal history of Americans and you can’t help but say he’s attacking white people. Maybe America shouldn’t have been a villain for its entire existence if they didn’t want to be criticized.   I’m American and grew up in the military. Military culture alone is fucking evil and does way more harm than good. It’s racist and imperialist and is backed with trillions of dollars.   Kyrie has visited and been accepted and embraced by native Americans and been a huge part of preserving their land. Literally almost all of natives were eradicated by Americans and europeans. They also made life for the surviving ones terrible and ripped them away from their families all the way up to the 90s now they continue to fight to preserve what little land that they have.   “Irving, visited the tribe's reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border for a daylong celebration recognizing their tribal heritage and support for the tribe's long battle against the Dakota Access oil pipeline”"
Maybe like a Devin Booker/Kyrie Irving?
"Can we just talk about blown layup aside that Kyrie Irving just blew by a double team, euro stepped a help defender, and then ball faked the big man help defender into oblivion while seamlessly weaving his way into the paint for an easy layup attempt?  He legitimately went 1 on 4 and made it look like he’s playing Sunday pick up games at the YMCA with 45 year old accountants."

"WTH with this nonsense.   First off, Terry is playing shooting guard, not PG. This has made all the difference for him. Big credit to him and the coaching staff for helping him evolve into an elite and \*efficient\* shotmaker.   Second, Terry is playing below average defense. His reputation as a tough defender has followed him, but he is inconsistent on ball, and consistently misplaced off ball.   Third, everyone knows this wasn't Terry for Kemba. It was the Hornets failing to find a good trade for Kemba when they knew they wouldn't be able to (or want to?) resign him. This was a sign Kemba, then, ok here we'll do a sign and trade let's make something work.   Fourth, it was a (calculated) overpay at the time. Some say it's because the Suns targeted Terry (who honestly would have been a nice fit alongside Booker). For those who foresaw Terry improving this much, not to mention the emergence of Devonte Graham last year to take over PG alongside him, credit to you, not discredit to those who dared doubt the gambling overpay. That said, Terry Rozier is a badass and I'm glad to have him.  Fifth, Kemba went to the Celtics, and now he is injury prone. This is part of the Curse of Isaiah Thomas (see also Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving) and what they get for cutting a dude who gave his heart, soul and body to that team in one of the NBA's most legendary single-season performances, but had the nerve to get hurt while playing on a shitty contract. They should have resigned and rehabbed him, but they dumped him on the street for Kyrie. Endure it, Ainge."
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
"Hey Giannis1995 in 2008, Javale McGee is a positive locker room presence on the young 2021 Cavs team.  They're young again? They must have had a long rebuilding process after LeBron retired.  Well, actually, LeBron is still the best player in the league and coming off a FINAL'S MVP. JaVale was actually a helpful part of the title team.  Wait, the Cavs won the 2020 title!!!!  Well, no. LeBron was on the Lakers.  Are you shitting me? LeBron left the Cavs for the Lakers!?  Well, actually, the Heat. To play with Wade and Bosh. They won two titles. Then Tim Duncan and the Spurs spanked them and he went back to Cleveland and they beat a 73-win Warriors team to win another title. Then he left to go to the Lakers a few years later, and was joined by this amazing big man with a unibrow.  Wait, wait. Did you say the Warriors won 73-games?  Yeah, they were like the best team in basketball for a solid 5 years. You know that Durant rookie guy? He left his team after the Warriors came from behind and beat his team 3-1 in the conference finals, and joined the Warriors. He's been the second best player in basketball for like a decade. Now he plays in Brooklyn with the guy LeBron won a title with.  The unibrow guy? Wait - did you say Brooklyn?  No, no. Kyrie Irving. He thinks the world is flat. Yes, Brooklyn. The Nets moved there. But New York is going crazy because the Knicks are over 500 for the first time, well basically, since before your time. It's a shame fans can't be in the stands to watch.  Wait, what? Are they doing construction or something?  Well, we've been in the midst of a global pandemic for over a year. We've basically been locked in our homes, restaurants and other businesses have basically been shut down all over the country, you have to wear a mask every time you leave your house. It's pretty fucked up and weird - over 500,000 people have died, but like 99% of people who contract the virus barely have symptoms. The Lakers won the title in a Disneyworld bubble.  Did you say 500,000 people died?!  Yeah, President Trump really fucked up the whole federal response. Good thing he's out of office now.  Donald Trump?!  Don't ask.  Hey - did Kobe ever end up winning a title without Shaq?  Yeah, two.  You're not going to tell me he's still playing.  I'm going to cry if I answer that question.  Wow, what a world. I can't fucking believe JaVale McGee is a great veteran locker room presence on the 2021 Cavs"
"Signing an aging Chris Paul who you traded after 2 seasons is a bit different than Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving teaming up."
Lebron has won zero games against the KD Warriors (in the playoffs) without Kyrie Irving.  Harden has won zero games against the Kd Warriors (in the playoffs) without Chris Paul.
"He said that if Lamelo was on the knicks he’d be an all star “for sure”, and that’s completely wrong.    He’s averaging 15.7/6.0/6.4 on decent shooting.    The two east starting guards are Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal, he obviously would not have eclipsed them in fan voting, which again is only half of the equation for all star starters.    If he wasn’t a starter he’d have to be chosen by the coaches, which he wouldn’t be. Again, 15/6/6 on ok shooting not gonna cut it for a guard in the east. Trae Young didn’t make it on 27/9/4!!!    So GTFOH with that"

They got an all star who was hurt the one year they did well with him on the team and then the next season he was a major factor in the toxic locker room problems the team had which lead to them not even making it to the conference finals. That was then followed by Kyrie Irving leaving and Boston literally got nothing and lost an all star. The trade was made in the attempt to win a championship and that being the case the trade was a failure.

"&gt; then you look at how horribly Kyrie Irving played in the conference semis against that Bucks team, gifting them a free trip to the conference finals  This narrative that's often repeated that ""Irving threw the series against the Bucks"" is such bullshit revisionism lmao."
"I am on board with telling Kyrie Irving to fuck off. I realize his entire persona is saying stupid shit but this is really ridiculous.  You don’t change the logo of the entire league because a friend of yours died. First of all the logo was just supposed to be a logo, when I was growing up nobody even knew that it was a silhouette of Jerry West, it was just a generic guy. it wasn’t until years later that they started calling him the logo and it became common knowledge that the artist used West as his model.  Second, if someone wouldn’t receive an honor if they were still alive you don’t give them the honor just because they died tragically, in retirement no less.  Lastly, if you were going to rank players as being deserving of having a silhouette on the logo of the league you have to go through a hell of a lot of guys before you get to Kobe Bryant. It’s either George Mikan, Bill Russell, Kareem, Jordan or LeBron. But the real answer is NO ONE, just like the original intent, it’s not supposed to be identified with one particular player.  The complete arrogance and lack of knowledge that Irving constantly displays makes him about the most annoying player in the NBA."

"&gt;Kyrie, so is he a superstar?  I thought he was viewed as one. Durant, Steph, KD, Harden, Bron, Giannis, Irving, etc. etc."
Everyone knows that the NBA all star voting isn't a popularity contest and that clearly Kyrie Irving is a better player than James Harden
"Honestly, a mediocre 76ers team came seconds away from eliminating that Raptors team, and then the Raptors would have been swept by a healthy Warriors, but wound up winning on the back of an insane injury plague to the Warriors; then you look at how horribly Kyrie Irving played in the conference semis against that Bucks team, gifting them a free trip to the conference finals, and keeping those things in mind, the loss in the second round to an unspectacular Heat team was right around the level we should have been expected to be at. The regular season wins both seasons were deceptive because teams didn't game plan to stop Giannis with a simple wall in the regular season, which led to the Bucks were walking over teams that weren't really trying their best to win; whereas, most teams gives LeBron or a defending conference champ their A game in the regular season. With the improvement in the depth in the East this year, I'm expecting a first round exit from Milwaukee unless they're the #1 seed, which doesn't look likely with Philly rising."
Kyrie Irving   Jaylen Brown   Jayson Tatum  Gordon Hayward  Al Horford
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/2/19/22291117/james-harden-brooklyn-nets-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving  It literally says it in the title.   They went all in to beat the Lakers or Clippers.
"Bruh the Nets are in their own tier right now from everyone else come playoff time lol. Rn I’m questioning the Lakers’ health, chemistry, and size even with LeBron there AD has been underperforming this year on top of all that, the Bucks and Sixers are routine frauds, I don’t trust PG to not become Pandemic P come playoff time. Utah right now is the closest thing to them because their shooting and star power (playoff Mitchell is a monster) but I just don’t see a team beating a trio of Kevin Durant-James Harden-Kyrie Irving in a 7 game series with their defense actually tightening up finally."
Fuckin Kyrie Irving.
It’s a shame because this game has given us some amazing moments. The Hardaway Waiters duel. The Kyrie Irving Brandon Knight homicide.
"&gt;Except Kawhi can't leave to team up with a Kyrie Irving-level player and have one of the deepest teams in the league. Once again he'd be signing with a team that's not that good like Chicago or New York. If he wants to go to an already established contender that can't get him otherwise (Bucks, Warriors, 76ers, Jazz) it's gonna cost them. If this situation were to play out it'd be similar to the Anthony Davis situation with New Orleans. It would take 3 young guys (or 2 + 1 star), a guaranteed top 10 pick, and more picks on top of that especially since sign-and-trades can only be for 3+ years and look what they got for Davis with only 1 year left on his.  Except he literally can do that with the Warriors  &gt;It would be a bidding war. Miami and Philadelphia both fumbled the bag with Harden so they'd be in the race. The 76ers would offer Simmons + Maxey, the Heat would offer 3 of Bam, Herro, and/or Robinson, the Celtics would offer Brown and their young guys, the Raptors would call and offer Siakam, the Nuggets would offer Murray, the Suns would offer Ayton, the Pelicans would offer Ingram, the Jazz would offer the Hawks would offer Collins and Hunter, hell... Even the Nets would probably see if they could get him for Kyrie. I think I'd take all of those offers (with appropriate picks attached of course) before taking Wiggins.  It wouldn’t be a bidding war since it’s literally a sign and trade. Do you understand how sign and trades work?   &gt;This discussion is asinine anyway since Leonard isn't gonna be requesting a trade. The Western Conference is weaker than its ever been with the ""dark horse"" being a team that made no significant changes and got bounced in the 1st round last season. This year should be the year we get Clippers/Lakers in the WCF and the healthier of the two teams will triumph.  Again, he wouldn’t be requesting a trade. He would be leaving in *free agency* through a sign and trade.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal) is the definition since you clearly don’t know what it means.  But yeah you’re clearly a biased Clippers fan so I guess I’m wasting my time."

"Article breakdowns from people who cover the league, film study from people who analyze the game on a deeper level than highlights (someone in your own sub may compile this - many fan bases do when they want to prove a point), or even your own detailed breakdown on how Gobert would manage to guard these players 1on1. Like what on earth is he doing vs Kyrie Irving to stay in front, not get fooled by his handle creativity/footwork that 99% of the league falls for while also not giving him enough space for him to pull up. How does he not need his teammates to provide ample help around him in these possessions."
"Brandon ""Kyrie Irving"" Ingram."
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are technically on non max deals.  They both took small pay cuts, their deals each had several bonus clauses, then the Nets signed their off season moves in such an order to add DeAndre Jordan at close to 10M a year over 4 years."
"That's not the argument at all.   &gt;Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  You're using a very generic TS% argument that doesn't actually apply. In the Durant/DJ comparison, both have positive efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a positive addition, therefore you want more of them.   Deandre Jordan = +12  Kevin Durant = +27  +27 &gt; + 12   In the Kyrie/Kemba comparison, both have negative efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a negative subtraction so you actually want less of them.   Kyrie Irving = -21  Kemba Walker = -17  -17 &gt; - 21  It's basic number line math. More negatives is not more good. A guy scoring poorly isn't helping you by scoring even more poorly.   Another example is Carmelo Anthony. Would you rather have Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a star or Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a role player?  At this point in his career, Carmelo Anthony trying to score 20ppg is detrimental to his team, he's better off scoring in a limited capacity and letting other guys take the shots instead.  &gt; so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans.  And for all intents and purposes, when Kyrie was sucking ass through a straw he tried to be the hero and got in everyone's way. When Kemba was sucking ass through a straw he let the Jays take over as the #1 and #2 options."
"Harden is passing to Joe 50% 3-pt shooter Harris and Kyrie Irving - who are Luka, Trae, and Steph passing to? Luka is passing to Tim Hardaway/Jalen Brunson, Trae is passing to John Collins/Capela, and Steph is passing to Oubre/Wiggins - all substantially worse than Joe Harris and Kyrie Irving, which thus makes it harder to create assists."
"Brooklyn has two Top 5 players and a Top 15 player.  And don’t forget about Kyrie Irving, All-Star starter, either."
"That, plus Kyrie Irving."
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"&gt;I agree trading for Kyrie was correct if you're smart enough to handle him like the diva he is, but they weren't so it wasn't correct.   You don't trade for a diva and then treat them like they're not one. Look at how Brooklyn treat him, the moron goes on a 2 week vacation without permission and he comes back and he's put right back into the team and people are constantly saying good things about him even tho he doesn't deserve it. Kyrie Irving is a little baby who needs to be treated like one and if you're gonna sign him and treat him like he's not one you're at fault when he quits on the team."
"""NBA suggests Kyrie Irving should STFU because that's totally not Jerry West on the NBA logo."""
Kyrie Irving has a lot of suggestions.
Kyrie Irving outside NBA Instagram  Chris Paul all time. He's like easily a Top 15 player imo.
"The consistent messaging that I get here is that players would prefer a coach that they can relate to. It's a pretty simply message that has value, and I'm glad KAT shared, but in no way is he calling the hiring process systematically racist. If anything it's a message to front offices around the league to better cater the hiring of coaches to the team's preferences.   Similarly, players like Jamal Crawford, Avery Bradley, and Kyrie Irving have expressed that they'd like to see more black people hired as coaches or front office execs. The thing is, they aren't saying that systematic racism is the problem here. They're just expressing their preferences. I can't find anyone/any article explicitly or even implicitly calling out the hiring process as systemically racist.   And to your final point, I don't disagree with the blanket statement of - ""since systemic racism plays a role in some hiring/admission processes, it's possible that it plays a similar role in the NBA coaching sphere"". But let's say hypothetically that the pool of coaching candidates is exclusively NBA retirees. What type of race-based advantage does a white NBA retiree have over their black colleague? The only thing I could point to would be the constant branding of white players as ""intellectual, good shooters, hard working, team players"". That might give them an advantage, but is that systemic racism? I have no clue, maybe it's warranted, maybe it isn't.   My issue is - when will people stop asking if the NBA coach hiring process is racist? What does the endgame look like? Is it when players feel comfortable enough with the diversity in the coaching role? Because that might create a negative racial bias against white players applying.   Bit of a rant, but I'll close with this. I think everyones goal for a hiring process is a merit based system where everyone comes from equal opportunity. My worry is that the NBA looks at what players like KAT are saying, and they overcorrect their hiring to match the player's preferences. NBA players feeling appropriately represented shouldn't be the only input in the coaches hiring process, and it certainly shouldn't be used as proof of an un-racist system. Probably could have said this more succinctly, but it is what is it. Happy to hear anyones thoughts on it though."
"Kyrie Irving, one of the best off the dribble creators in the NBA, with some of the best handles in the league, the ability to beat most defenders in isolation or in the pick and roll, with a career assist to TO ratio of better than 2:1, has never been a good playmaker?  Ease up on the hot takes there, chief."
"Kyrie ""Black Kings"" Irving"
"Lmao I doubt Adam Silver spends much of his day to day worrying about Kyrie Irving, if at all"
Is anyone gonna post about Kyrie Irving?
"Yes it is, in the context of franchise leaders. Rate stats mean way less on franchise leaderboards, per the examples I gave you. Counting stats mean a lot more, that the player played with the franchise at a high level for a long time. No one gives a shit that kyrie Irving leads the celtics in PER because he basically played one season. Nor that Daniel Theis has the highest offensive rating. If lebron had played half a season here he'd be the leader in a bunch of rate stats. Plumlee is the nuggets leader in efg%. Monte Morris has a higher offensive rating than Jokic.   Rate stats mean a clearly lesser player can be on the leaderboard. That's damn hard to do with counting stats for a franchise"
"Would you recommend a youth large ? I wanna get the Brooklyn nets kyrie Irving city edition Swingman Jersey and they don’t have XL, should I get Large? Or should I not get it"
"Andre Drummond if you don’t actually watch games/just see stats.  I also think Kyrie Irving is slightly overrated, not nearly as much as I used to think, but still just enough to where I think many people rate him a bit too high"
TFW you realize Kyrie Irving is the least efficient player in the 8-man rotation.
So miniscule that Kyrie Irving and DeShawn Jackson shout them out and the black community overwhelming supports them. So miniscule that Malcolm X is still lifted to a God like status. Give me a break.
and some really good role players like James Harden and Kyrie Irving to compliment those stars
"🙄 No tf he’s  not.    The league is loaded. The mvp front runners (Embiid and Jokic) are barely top 10. Kyrie Irving—-KYRIE IRVING—-whos at 27ppg on like 50-50-90, is outside of many top 15’s.   Gobert is a deserving all star but last year was proof: defense-centric players  only get you so far. If you can’t score there’s a cap to how good you are.   Are we not learning anything from Draymond Green? Gobert is more Draymond green—-big time plus player and key cog but still not a star—-than star player. Gobert has been there for years and they were never this good. It’s not all him. It’s Conley finally healthy, Mitchell ascending , and cohesion of the role players"
You forgot his name wasn't Kyrie Irving

"I understand that, but offensively: Kyrie Irving right now is better than Chris Paul was during his time with Houston. I’m not sure this is debatable  Kyrie was second team all nba 2018-2019  year, but got injured. Harden clearly didn’t want to carry the scoring load and CP3 at that point in his career wasn’t doing what Kyrie is now, where Harden can naturally transition into a PG role."
Curry over Kobe is disgusting. Kobe had the ability to lock up Kyrie Irving. GSW wouldn’t dare leave curry alone with him. Your probably a young child who never got to see  Kobe’s prime so I forgive your extreme ignorance

"Why are you on about watching the game then just quoting FTA stats like I can’t get that shit from a BBref page?  Yeah, refs miss a lot of calls on Jokic. They miss a lot of calls on everyone. Jokic probably gets it worse than most but this incessant crying like two guys with wildly differing play styles should be getting anything resembling the same number of FTs is ridiculous. Do you also wonder why Tim Duncan never shot as many FTs as Giannis does? Why Kyrie Irving doesn’t get FTs like Harden?  A man whose game is built around a) backing people down from the high post and b) playmaking is not going to get to the line anywhere near as often as somebody who plays in the low post and face up, because they’re not in a position to be fouled while shooting in the first place. “Watching games” ^TM will tell you exactly why he’s nothing like Embiid at all when you wipe away your teary eyes and spend more time with your eyeballs on the screen watching your own team than searching up Joel Embiid’s FT rate."

"Yeah not like KD joined the team who beat him when they were up 3-1 and had a 73-9 record the year before, won some rings and only ever lost because of injury, then joined up with kyrie Irving and his team traded for a superstar and former mvp who demanded a trade to form a team that somehow is more stacked than the defending champs led by Lebron and AD.

"How can you even compare the 16 GSW to this Nets team? The regular season performance doesn’t mean anything in this case. The Nets have way more talent, two MVPs in their prime and a superstar in Kyrie Irving plus a whole bunch of solid supporting players with a wide range of skillsets like defence, rebound, outside shooting, slashers. Assuming they are healthy come playoffs time which is a big if, no one beats this Nets team cuz we are in the new era now where the rules have made it much harder to guard elite offensive players. If you can’t score 125-130 easily, you can’t expect to win against this Nets team."
"Yup. Even as a high volume player at full health in 2019, Griffin only had 37 dunks, because he was shouldering the Pistons' entire offense from the high post and perimeter all season (and did an incredible job, hence the All-NBA Third Team honor).   Blake couldn't play off of guys like Chris Paul, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, or Kevin Durant in Detroit. Instead, we kind of needed and expected him to be all of those dudes on his own."

Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving going over there didn’t really get anyone in their feelings (I don’t think) but watching harden force a trade to a contender then seeing two solid veterans get bought out so they can ring chase just kinda sucks as a viewer.   Doesn’t make what the players or the team did wrong, and the viewers aren’t necessarily wrong either. Just kinda sucks a little is all"
Or Kyrie Irving style?
I know I'm wrong but I'm also right. When he's on Kyrie Irving has been the best player I've seen in the NBA all season.  Just awesome.
lol a slightly better version of Kyrie Irving is one of the best players in the league. How are you knocking him if you think he's that good. That's an amazing player!
Kyrie Irving 28/5/6 on 51/39/90 and 61 TS%. Yea he’s a superstar this year
KYRIE IRVING WITH THE DUNK HOLY
"&gt;Player-coaches  I was going to say that, then I remembered [these comments.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kyrie-irving-doesnt-see-nets-as-having-a-head-coach-despite-recent-hire-of-steve-nash/)"
"Or well, not shooting 18% from 3 when he has the opportunities would also help. Dame is the most overprotected superstar player in the league by a mile because of his loyalty and game winning shots, dude has stunked up in every playoff elimination series since 2014. Instead of blaming Stotts and his teammates, let's just admit that Portland's problem is that their best player isn't as good as people want to make him out to be.  Damian Lillard has shot under 40% from the field (four times) in a playoff series more times than he has shot over 45% (twice), in fact Dame has shot under 20% from 3 twice in playoff series and that's in 11 series played total for his career, he's just not a good playoff performer that gets a pass in the regular season due to halfcourt 3 pointers.  But whatever, Portland fans will downvote me and say that i'm hating when the reality is that Dame is a slightly better version of Kyrie Irving, but without the playoff success."
Kyrie Irving is criminally underrated
"Ok, you keep changing the subject and not answering anything, so let me go back to the beginning:  What could Danny Ainge have done to prevent Kyrie Irving from becoming a flat-earther lunatic with a victim complex? He traded IT for a top 10 player in the league and then built around him. What else could he have done?"
Kyrie “Black Zetsu” Irving
Kyrie Irving did not drop 27 ppg and hit the championship winning shot in those finals just for some Bronsexual to say Lebron won that series single-handedly 5 years later lmaoooo

"Actually it’s very relevant to the subject since we are talking about finals.  You find me one series where Scottie performed on the level of even 2016 Kyrie Irving?? And Kyrie isn’t even lebrons top 2 teammate. He had a whole decade teaming up with atleast 2 all stars untill he came to the lakers and even then, tried to recruit Kawhi to join him and AD and almost had Lowry. Comparing his teammates to Mj is not even close   Find me one series where Scottie pulled a 2016 Kyrie, 2020 AD, 2011 Wade???? Please I want you too"
"Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, Matthew Dellavedova, and Kyrie Irving (just game 1 but it counts)."
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.       Hopefully you don't mind but I decided to post this ranked table for total differential.        |Rank|Team|Player|Total Differential| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|**17.6**| |2|LA Lakers|LeBron James|**15.2**| |3|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid|**14.7**| |4|Utah Jazz|Rudy Gobert|**14.4**| |5|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|**12.2**| |6|LA Clippers|Paul George|**11.0**| |7|LA Clippers|Kawhi Leonard|**10.7**| |8|Minnesota Timberwolves|Karl-Anthony Towns|**10.7**| |9|Brooklyn Nets|Kevin Durant|**9.8**| |10|Denver Nuggets|Nikola Jokic|**9.8**| |11|Miami Heat|Jimmy Butler|**9.5**| |12|LA Lakers|Anthony Davis|**8.4**| |13|Atlanta Hawks|Trae Young|**8.1**| |14|Houston Rockets|Christian Wood|**7.9**| |15|Toronto Raptors|Pascal Siakam|**7.9**| |16|Detroit Pistons|Jerami Grant|**7.8**| |17|Brooklyn Nets|Kyrie Irving|**7.5**| |18|Boston Celtics|Jason Tatum|**7.4**| |19|Miami Heat|Bam Adebayo|**6.6**| |20|New York Knicks|Julius Randle|**6.1**| |21|Dallas Mavericks|Luka Doncic|**6.0**|"
"Idk man, Vuc is an all star.  Don’t you think going from John Wall’s corpse to Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving might have been slightly better for Harden? That’s just this season."
"No order:  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  John Wall   Russell Westbrook  Derrick Rose  Tony Parker  Kyrie Irving  Rajon Rondo  Kyle Lowry  Damian Lillard  Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas and Kemba Walker are very close"
"Only 16% of Jaylen Browns shots come from mid range 2s, and he shoots them at a great clip. His shot selection has literally nothing to do with the Celtics offensive struggles.   The Celtics struggles come mainly from the ISO heavy offense they play. And before you try and put the blame on the Celtics current personnel, here's the Celtics rank in the NBA in ISO possessions per game   2021 - 7th  2020 - 8th   2019 - 8th   2018 - 7th   Doesn't matter if we have Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kemba Walker, or the Jays. The Celtics have been an ISO heavy team for years, and the only common denominator is Brad Stevens."
"Well what other explanation is it lol  This happens to Steph Curry, kyrie irving, and Zach lavine  It happened to derrick rose.  Some players get way less calls than they deserve   Are you saying that it's a conspiracy? Because I'm saying it's a simple answer. Refs are biased toward certain players."
I was at this game and I would be upset too if my dad was an all star power forward getting clamped up by Kyrie Irving in the fourth quarter.
1. Tracy McGrady 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Allen Iverson 4. Larry Bird 5. Michael Jordan 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Chris Paul 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Yao Ming
Yes.  Kyrie has 2 kids.  Remember the 2nd time he took games off for this year that happened to fall on his birthday?  [Link](https://www.awesemo.com/sideaction/kyrie-irving-and-his-fiance-marlene-wilkerson-are-expecting/)  ^ Thats why he missed it.  His daughter was born that week.
Harden has a +1.0 netrtg on the Nets. Lebron has a +15.2 netrtg this season. You’re downplaying how good the Nets are even without Durant. Kyrie Irving is averaging 28/5/6 on near 51/39/90 splits. Joe Harris shoots 48% from 3 on high volume.
Lmfao are you high? The only way they’re winning the championship is with a supercharged offence and Kyrie Irving is one of the best offensive players in the league.
Kyrie Irving is underrated
Were the nets any good before getting jeff green? Jeff green &gt; kyrie irving
O god advice from Kyrie Irving....
&gt;I don’t know is there’s more skilled player than Kyrie Irving in the league right now.   Imma just say it. I think Kyrie is the most skilled player in the history of the game. The shit he does with the ball in his hands EVERY GAME is insane.
"Kyrie Irving man, what a game! His ability to get a bucket in any way is insane.  The best thing about the addition of LA to the team is that DeAndre hasn't toughed the floor. If Cclaxton can start getting more minutes (he only played 12 minutes last night), I'd be happy -- he's a menace on defense and switches so well. He looked a bit rougher on offense last night, partly because Harden wasn't around much to feed him gimme looks, but I still think he can be a big contributor going forward.  Here's hoping that Harden is fine -- I tuned in after he went off so I didn't see the injury happen, but it sounds like it's largely precautionary. With KD back this week, Harden can hopefully have same time to rest up and have all of the big 3 in shape come playoffs.  In general the Knicks looked pretty good too. RJ Barret was a man possessed towards the end, he just kept hitting big buckets. Randle had a decent look to beat the buzzer for the tie. Glad to complete the regular season series sweep against our bros across the East River, and we'll keep an eye out for them in the playoffs (Subway Series first round??)."
i would comfortably go out on a limb and say kyrie irving probably knows quite a lot about basketball

Who do you mean by Doc? Doc Rivers? Also when did Ainge take Kyrie’s word over his?   Which trade at the deadline was even proposed that included Kyrie? From what I remember he wasn’t even included in talks with New Orleans for AD. [This is what this article says too.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/04/celtics-sheltering-irving-from-the-trade-deadline-whirlwind/amp/)  Even [this source](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2833296-kyrie-irving-rumors-clippers-asked-celtics-about-deadline-trade-got-quick-no.amp.html) says the Celtics gave a “quick no” to the Clippers when they asked about Kyrie. Besides is Tobias Harris and Lou Williams really enough of a “what if” over Kawhi Leonard?
Here’s an article from after game 1. This is my memory of what happened at least in the Warriors’ wins:  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/06/warriors-cavaliers-game-1-kyrie-irving
We've seen Giannis Antetokounmpo underperform in two consecutive high level playoff series directly because of a glaring flaw in his game that can be exploited.   Kyrie Irving shooting like crap in one playoff run means dick. Players have bad overall 9 game stretches all the time. I don't think he can be the best player on a championship team but to suggest that 21 PPG on 49% TS is what you should expect from him in the playoffs because it happened once is pure stupidity.
"&gt;You don’t even have a point  Kyrie Irving - 28 on 61 TS  Luka Doncic - 29 on 60 TS  Dame Lillard - 30 on 62 TS  Giannis - 29 on 63 TS  Jokic - 26 on 65 TS  Embiid - 30 on 65 TS  Zach Lavine - 28 on 64 TS  Beal - 31 on 60 TS  Curry - 29 on 64 TS  &amp;#x200B;  Okay, there's the point. He is statistically not a top 5 scorer in the league."
Let’s go inside the mind of a Kyrie Irving
Knicks just lost to our C team. We were down 2 starters and 3 of our key bench guys. Ouch.   Jokes aside bullock is a damn flamethrower Jesus. Barrett had a great game they should’ve went to him down the stretch. And kyrie Irving put on a damn show like only he can.
some dude named Kyrie Irving &gt; the Knicks’ “Big 15😈😈😈”

yeah in a fat L cause kyrie irving aint a lead man
"one thing is clear, kyrie irving cannot be the #1 guy on a team"
The nets are now being led by Irving because he is the coach. This is going to be a fun game.  At his best Kyrie can carry this. But he could get hurt.

"You must accumulate a minimum amount of makes in each category before you can qualify for the 50/40/90 club. Since this season is shortened at 72 games the minimum makes are 264 FGs, 72 3Ps and 110 FTs. Neither Satoransky who hasn't reached half of the minimum makes in any category and especially Snell (with 7 FTs) are close to qualify for the club given their currents rates.   This season the players who seem most likely to make the club are Tobias Harris and Kyrie Irving, after them I'd say that Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard and Khris Middleton are next in line."

"It really is insane fucking reps to tighten your handle, this isn’t some god given talent that you just inherited.  Literally Kyrie Irving spent hundreds of hours with a grocery bag on his ball working on his handle as a kid"
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Maybe if we define ""skill"" as ""only the parts of the game that Kyrie Irving is the best at"". Then yeah, sure."
What’s your baseline of a good above average 1st pick? Imo it’s Kyrie Irving
"Irving is a superstar in terms of popularity, but not talent. Still good though.  Kyrie + good role players isn’t a contender. A win game against isn’t impressive."

"The hiring of Rod Thorn as the Nets GM, and his subsequent trade of Stephon Marbury for Jason Kidd, changed everything for our franchise. Even the team we have now started in part because Kyrie Irving was a fan of that Nets team and thus came here with KD."

"While I do wish the people who say ""HOW CAN HARDEN BE MVP WITH KYRIE IRVING ON HIS TEAM"" would see how bad the Nets are without Harden running things,  &amp;#x200B;  this aint it lmao"
the nets are going to lose an nba championship because of kyrie irving
"Brogdon is not as good as Jrue but he is younger and cheaper and can fill out maybe 85% of Jrue's production. I'm in the minority around here who doesn't think Jrue is worth potentially five FRPs since he's an injury-prone 30-year old PG now on a max contract.   The Bucks are small market and therefore obviously have to overpay to get people which is its own set of bullshit but I also think the timing screwed them over a bit here. Off the heels of AD and Paul George being traded for massive piles of FRPs kind of changed the market. Just a few years ago, the Celtics got Kyrie Irving for a single FRP and a serviceable PG and wing.  Ultimately I don't think this works out for the Bucks unless they win a championship in the next year or two, and with the Nets looking unstoppable that might be out of the question.   I foresee the Bucks making a run yet losing in the playoffs again this year, leading to the coach getting fired, leading to a new coach and optimism abound, followed by a really strong first year where they come close to the finals, followed by Jrue getting hurt again and coming back at 32 years old and dealing with a laundry list of injuries plus age and therefore not being super effective anymore while on a massive contract that makes doing anything else with the roster prohibitive. The Bucks kind of stall out, they have no lottery picks to help the team grow because they're all in New Orleans, Giannis sees the writing on the wall and bails, and the Bucks are back to square one in a rebuild.  I don't want this to seem shitty towards Bucks fans because I think more than anything they get screwed because of small market bs. But this is my honest assessment. I think the Bucks bought in on Jrue when the market was fucked as kind of a panic move to make Giannis happy, which sold out the franchise in the near future, and I don't think it's going to work.  I think the same thing is going to happen to the Clippers for the record. My prediction is we're going to see a reckoning on all these teams that sold out all their FRPs. The same thing happened with the Celtics/Nets Pierce/KG trade and that was a fraction of what all these mega-trades recently have been."
"Kyrie and Harris in the starting 5 are massive holes on defence. Joel has feasted on DeAndre Jordan (In 7 appearances he’s 6-1. In 2 games this season Joel has combined 53 pts vs Jordan’s 8). Griffin and Aldridge have looked washed defensively this season, but we have no idea if they will show up for the playoffs now on this team.  The biggest issue is they don’t have plus level defenders than can close down their matchup. Harden and KD could show up or go missing, but I’m inclined to think in the playoffs they will step up a notch and at the very least be average.   Dinwiddie is another guard who is eh defensively. Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson and Shamet won’t get heavy minutes but again are all lacklustre defensively.  The only way they can put a team out there who can play defence is if one of Jordan/Griffin/Aldridge shows up and Harden/KD take massive strides to make up for Irving and Harris. Honestly if I’m Nash I’d run Dinwiddie with Harden as much as possible and try and rotate Harris/Irving, as Dinwiddie/Harden/Irving/KD/+Big or Dinwiddie/Harden/Harris/KD/+Big is good enough to not be exposed consistently."
"Friendly reminder that of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry.  And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall."
"Irving played 20 games last year and missed a bunch this year. That's far from being available and at least Durant is truly available when he's not legitimately injured, unlike Kyrie.   Ok, he has more trade value, but you didn't answer who you'd buy with said value.   Yeah, I'm not gonna argue your medical diagnosis on someone who's not your patient. Even if he's more injury prone, taking into account that 1) he's a far better basketball player than Irving, 2) that he attracts good basketball players even when he's injured, 3) that Irving is also injury prone and more unreliable behaviour wise, I don't see why I shouldn't take my chances with KD."
"Oh yeah? I hope Kyrie Irving drops you from the highest skyscraper and Superman comes and scoops you up right before you hit the floor, and then he drops you from higher!"
"I mean it comes down to the players. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Lamarcus Aldridge is a stronger lineup than any 5 the Lakers can put out there."
"Ask Kyrie ""won't shoot 8/22 again"" Irving"
Guess you missed the part where Kyrie Irving put a dagger in the upgraded version of the 2015 Warriors.
"Look at literally any actual basketball analysis and the 2015 warriors are one of the best teams of all time.  Keep your narratives but if youre gonna tell me Jrue Holiday, pat Bev, Mike Connelly, and Kyrie Irving would have stopped this team at any point... well, believe what you want dude"
"To be fair to him this sub doesn't care to mock or to hate a player regardless of age. To Anthony Bennett, Marvin Bagley, Kyrie Irving to name a few. I'm sure you are guilty too so don't act like he is bad and you're good. Atleast he is hating his game. Some here hate players even not related to basketball."
"&gt;single-handedly  Wow, no credit to the other 4 players on the court with him, alongside Kyrie Irving."
"Durant has, by far, the best TS% ever in the Finals. Not sure how that's a worse look for Curry than it is for all of the guys who have shot worse than Curry.

they’re still definitely a top 7-8 team ever. The difference between then being the greatest team ever and just another great regular season team is not a Kyrie Irving stepback 3.
1. Smush Parker 2. Spudd Webb 3. Sergio Rodriguez 4. Earl Boykins 5. Aaron Holiday 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Steve Kerr 8. Ish Smith 9. Steph Curry 10. Kenny Smith  1-5 are complete locks but the latter half can be argued and moved around a bit
"&gt; Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
Kyrie Irving
"&gt;This is factually incorrect as Kyrie Irving was not a max contract player in 2018, he had a salary of $18.8M (**half** of what Kemba is due to earn next year!).   Maybe you should read up on how the salary cap works. Kyrie's contract was a max extension at the time that he signed it. He was on a max contract. The value of a max contract changes year to year and based on experience. For example, Steph Curry makes $43M, so is Kemba not on a max deal?   &gt;And even if you think they ever had a chance of beating Lebron, if they made the finals they were going to lose to the Warriors in 5 games.  They were not at all legitimate contenders that year.   They definitely had a chance of beating Lebron. They were up 3-2 and were in the lead in the 4th quarter of game 7.   And being in the finals makes you a contender. People could have said that the raptors weren't really contenders. Then KD and Klay went down and look what happened.    &gt;I am telling you, it is completely unprecedented and a ridiculous concept for a team to be a **real** contender when you have a bad max contract.   Kevin Love - 9 pts, 7 rebs in the finals - 15 pts, 6 rebs in ECF with very bad defence = nba champion   Michael Finley - 2006 Mavs - 4th highest paid player in the NBA, didn't play   Keith Van Horn - 2006 Mavs - 14th highest paid player in the NBA, played 12mpg   David Lee - 2015 Warriors, highest paid player on 25% of salary cap, played 8mpg in the playoffs   Larry Hughes - 2007 Cavs averaged 11ppg in the playoffs, paid 25% of the cap   Patrick Ewing 1999 - highest paid player in the NBA, injured for the playoffs, knicks made the finals   I'm not going to keep going back but I've proven my point.   20, 4 &amp; 5 of decent efficiency is not bad relative to the examples above. Its not what you hope for from a max contract but its a nice player.   By this logic Mike Conley and Tobias Harris are bad max contracts, too. And they are on the two 1 seeds."
"Historically, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. All three had very high bars for their teammates albeit Duncan was a different more introverted leadership.  This season? James Harden. Looks at yesterday's play he had with Claxton. He managed to even inspire dour faced Kyrie Irving an get him to laugh early in the season and build chemistry."
"""In the locker room, James Harden is watching Hustlers when he calls over Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving: ""You see this shit right here. You die for what you believe in. You die for your boys. This is that mentality we need to have going into the strip club. It’s about making it rain."""
"Such a bullshit narrative. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wanted to team up, and they thought they would cute in black and white. They also convinced James Harden and Blake Griffin to quit on their teams to come join the bandwagon. None of this has to do with skill on the part of the Nets' front office. As long as they were better than the Knicks, they were getting KD and Kyrie."
"I mean, he moved the #8 pick for Kyrie Irving and built a roster with a starting 5 of guys who were or would shortly be all-star level players. Not to mention, a bench led by Smart/Morris/Rozier. I have my criticisms of some of the team's asset management since the Nets trade, but they built a legit contender regardless. Those marginal mistakes only appear more glaring now because that contender ended up falling apart after the Hayward injury."

"&gt;The Nets also traded away half their roster to get Harden so when he doesn't play the depth especially isn't there. Plus he is the only playmaker on the team. Kyrie and KD are score first players.  That doesn't really work as an argument because if Irving or Durant is missing, then the Net's depth is also crippled. The point being highlighted here is that just Harden and one of Irving/Durant would have an insane win rate."
"Celtics fan talking shit???   Since drafting Tatum y’all has had 7 first round picks (2.3 per draft) and u guys still couldn’t make a quality nba roster. You basically traded Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Al Hartford, Marcus Morris for Kemba. You guys passed up on Myles turner for Gordon Hayward and got nothing instead. Despite losing all that talent and having so many young draft picks your team is in #20 in cap space with an Evan Fournier contract coming up. You guys are worse than the Kings, tatum can’t wait to leave your poverty squad and join the Lakers he doesn’t even hide it 😂"
"Lebron wasn’t a perfect fit with other ball dominant players. It isn’t a coincidence that last year was the easiest championship run Lebron ever had. Yes he won in Miami, but that was because the team was so stacked. Yes he won in Cleveland but Irving had to take a back seat and they staggered the line up. Besides Kyrie really isn’t a point guard. He is mostly a shooting guard. And even then they needed an absolute miracle come back and a suspension of Draymond to win.  Yes KD didn’t win with Harden. Harden was only 21 year old.  Yes KD didn’t win with Russ. But NO ONE and I mean NO ONE will win a ring with Russ being the primary decision maker and then having terrible shooters like Kendrick Perkins, Steven Adams, Thabo Sefalosha, and Andre Roberson as the other starters."
"Idk if we’re going off their career in general or just their time with the Nets, but here’s a rough list  Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving/Deron Williams  James Harden/Joe Johnson/Vince Carter  Kevin Durant/Dr. J/Paul Pierce  Kevin Garnett/Derrick Coleman/Kenyon Martin  Brook Lopez  If it’s just about their time with the Nets, then you can go ahead and replace Pierce with Richard Jefferson and Deron with Drazen Petrovic. I’m sure I may be forgetting some people.   Honorable mention based on career: Sam Bowie, Buck Williams"

"Drafting is only half the work. There's only so much a ""generational talent"" can do for a team, if he's not surrounded by a good supporting cast. Look at the Cavs team before Lebron left for Miami, that wasn't exactly what you would call a contender. After LBJ left, they drafted another ""generational talent"" in Kyrie Irving, and...well, still dead in the water. The path to getting good for small markets is drafting, developing, and surrounding the high draft pick player with good teammates."
"Ah yes the terrible, healthy in the playoffs starting line up of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Daniel Theis, Aron Baynes and Robert Williams of the bench 3 years ago. A 4-1 loss in the second round is all that could be expected of such a subpar roster. PJ Dozier on a two way then"
"Nothing. Just a couple of scrubs called Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kyrie Irving."
and kyrie irving. he just ended up leaving them.
"Tatum, brown, james young, and traded one of the picks as part of a package to acquire kyrie irving"
LeBron is better at basketball than Kyrie Irving.
This is really just parroting the same take from the last two years standing on the single leg of an out-of-context stat (volume of shots contested in a single year with no comparison to previous).   Kyrie Irving has contested 48 more shots over the entire season and is worse at contesting them from every range in the tracking data.  It also just doesn't follow from having watched him play the last two years. I don't see how you could think his effort this year is at the same (low) level it was during his first two seasons unless you either aren't watching now or weren't watching then and just decided to pull up the tracking to cherrypick.
If Kyrie Irving can come back and get 4/7 from 3 he could also have a 50/40/90 season

"Kyrie Irving. Exciting and fun to watch, not a winner, he owes his entire reputation to Lebron."
Also have two former MVPs still in their prime as well as an all star starter. The names alone make them a pretty big favorite. James Harden and Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Make whatever excuses you will that team better win a chip
"mason starting talking cuz kyrie was taking too long on a free throw and he thought the ball was dead,it through him off and irving missed the free throw and was pissed. pistons vs celtics a couple years ago i think."

"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.

They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it’s hard to forecast the future.  Can’t believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
"Kyrie irving is not third option on the nets and he is the most skilled offensive player in the league. He's top 3 most skilled offensive player in nba history right behind mj and kobe. I think he's smaller than both of em and does what they do decides dunking, he's probably the most skilled player in nba history"
Kyrie Irving is great at fancy dribbling and did a wonderful job having a top 2-3 all time player as a teammate.
Probably rigged too.  I'd be salty if I were a Minnesota fan.  2011 Twolves had the best odds for #1 in a pick that went on to become Kyrie Irving. Twolves instead got #2 and Derrick Williams.
"&gt;Here’s an indication of Adebayo’s defensive versatility: In its game notes highlighting the 23-year-old’s prowess at that end, the Heat talk about his success against guards, limiting them to 38.9% shooting this season, including 31.8% on 3-pointers. Among the players held below their usual production when Adebayo has been matched up with them – per NBA.com tracking info – have been Steph Curry (1-of-5), Bradley Beal (1-of-7), Devin Booker (3-of-11), Kyrie Irving (4-of-14) and LeBron James (2-of-8).

To think that the 73 win team is any way shape or form the same as the one that added Kevin fucking Durant is laughable. Same goes for the Cavs that just lost Kyrie Irving for basically nothing.
"I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do with a holistic player measurement that suggests Fred Van Vleet is more impactful to winning than James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, and Kevin Durant. If your suggestion is to ignore what doesn’t seem to make sense then it returns back to a subjective evaluation of the data and at that point the LEBRON measurement is pretty damn useless. This has been essentially my critique of all these holistic player measurements. They don’t really add anything to the NBA discussion besides confirmation bias when a player you like/dislike is rated high/low on RAPTOR, LEBRON, etc."
"To be fair you guys have the most emotionally fragile set of stars currently in the league, possibly of all time: Mr. Kyrie ""dunning Kruger, Flat earth, I don't talk to pawns"" Irving, James playoff choker harden, and Kevin ""hardest road, yell at my agent and make a bunch of Twitter burners"" Durant. Totally set for playoff success."
JPM is a multi billion dollar hundred year old organization with a history of exploitation.   Kyrie Irving is a self made millionaire who is trying to grow his wealth through investment into underprivileged and underrepresented groups.   How are they even comparable?

"No I'm not talking about supporting the companies that they invest in. I'm talking about a completely different consulting component for underserved communities. That's the sense i got in the article I read earlier. See: https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/5/10/22429284/kyrie-irving-once-again-reaches-out-to-community-this-time-underrepresented-entrepreneurs  Where did you read that the business was pretty much just a VC firm? Given the actual announcement (where the collaboration with a VC is secondary to the primary program), I get the sense that you're jumping to conclusions and making assumptions that aren't true. Happy to be proven otherwise though if you have a source."
"I'm sure Kyrie Irving is sad to not have your money, u/Adm1ns_R_Cucks."

"Not entirely sure what this is, but it sounds very Kyrie Irving"
"It appears to be an Ankh, it was used by the Ancient Egyptians and it also is used as a symbol for African identity. Egypt is located within North Africa hence part of the connection. Additionally, Kyrie recently dropped a collab sneaker with him, Asia Irving and Concepts. It centers around the Ancient Egyptian culture. You will also see Kyrie has posted on his Instagram a photo of an Ancient Egyptian figure, it's something he has become more and more curious about."
"Even if it was true (it’s not) that somehow the Lakers are bad enough to be a good 1st match up, your reasoning still makes zero sense.   &gt;	Bottom line is you need to beat the Lakers to make the Finals.   Or you just let someone else beat the Lakers in the first round and then you don’t have to face them at all. I’m confused,  on some of you’re comments you say Lakers are easy title favourites... but also a good 1st round matchup? That makes no sense at all.  Given all your posts and comments it seems like you’re just trying to make your Nets *not* seem like title favourites and paint them as underdogs while also bashing the Lakers for being bad enough to face in first round as a good matchup ngl.  Y’all must’ve been watching too much Kyrie Irving highlights to make this little sense."
"You’re right, being an asshole is a personality. I also never said he was a monster. I don’t have a deep seeded hate for him because he’s a domestic abuser. He would actually be in trouble if the nba/American culture actually cared about anti Semitic statements but even then I don’t hate him over it because I think he’s too stupid to actually know what he’s saying a lot of the time. This doesn’t go beyond finding him annoying.   Also, he’s not living a life most people couldn’t understand. There are millions of housewives across the country doing intermittent fasting to lose weight.  Also edit to add: we have literally no idea how his teammates and coaches really feel about him because nobody is going to talk poorly about a guy they currently work with or who they currently play in the league with because unlike Kyrie Irving, most players in the nba strive to at least pretend to be professional."
"So $40,000 fines are the way to get Kyrie Flatearth Irving to speak to the “pawns”. Nice to know!"
Skill boost: Kyrie Irving - imagine Kyrie somehow being even more skilled!  Athleticism boost: Joe Harris - defensively he can be a liability due to his lack of athleticism  3 inch size boost: Kevin Durant - the thought of KD being the same player but 3 inches taller is frightening
"As long as the lack of glory and respect continues to eat away at Kevin “Skin Thinner Than his Legs” Durant and Kyrie “Three Eyes and Zero Brains” Irving, I’ll be satisfied."
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
Why is Kyrie Irving the only one who needs to eat after a game? I think he’s sending a message about what he really thinks of these media sessions.
1 Kevin Durant  2 James Harden  3 Kyrie Irving
"&gt; Unless of course you support the message of the Black Hebrew Israelites, in which case, I mean you're kinda just a shitty person who hates Jews.  Holy assumptions.  Kyrie Irving is fasting and it shows when he plays his game, he simply said 'excuse me i am hungry' and here you are calling that forced."
Did Bezos have a Kyrie Irving? What was the equivalent of a gamewinning shot in a game 7?
"because when a good player develops a stacked resume that puts them in the conversation for all time greatness, any gaps they may have gain additional significance.  let's look at two recent examples of all-time point guards, CP3 and Steph. Steph's accomplishments speak for themselves, as do his per game stats/efficiency. the main thing that separates him from his peers in the top 8-15 range is his lack of finals MVPS. so it becomes a big talking point, despite the inherent ridiculousness of putting so much weight behind a reactionary media award. on the flip side, you have CP3, whose box stats seem kinda lame until you watch a game and realize that the man single-handedly elevates his entire team in almost all aspects of the game. for him, rings and Finals appearances are a problem because his whole claim to fame is his contribution to team success. for example, while CP3 is a better point guard and OVERALL player than Kyrie Irving, Kyrie has been more successful in big moments at his role (score a bunch of points when his team needs it) than CP3 has been in his role (be the mastermind who does all the subtle things needed to make the team better).   it's not fair or reasonable but trying to compare incredible talents is always going to end with some weird and arbitrary nitpicking."
"2 titles were because KD joined a 73-9 win team  Currys other title is due to kevin love and kyrie irving being injured  Aside from shooting 3s Curry really doesnt have much of a legacy  No finals MVPs, no championships that were actually earned, no game winning playoff shots"
"- That 1st quarter is crazy to rewatch with how scorching Porter Jr. was and how cold Kyrie started  - Hopefully Nash has finally learned that win probability and DJ's minutes have an inverse relationship  - I'm not sure if it's a positive for Denver that so many guys got good looks throughout the game or a negative that no one could capitalize on those looks except Campazzo  - Bol-Mcgee lineups, why Malone? Why?  - This was a very physical game, glad the refs didnt decide to get whistle happy at a random juncture of the game  - Durant with his typical quiet 30, Irving stole the show in the 3rd quarter, but Blake was the cog that kept the Nets afloat to stay within striking distance, hitting crucial shots and using the ""Curry Defense"" on Jokic(refs cant call em all)  - With no DJ, the Nets doubles and digs looked so much sharper versus the Milwaukee games"
Russ has been a delight followed by Mr. box office Kyrie Irving.
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"Kyrie ""Technically Correct"" Irving"
“It’s pretty insane how efficient a team with Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving is!!!”
Those people are making a ridiculous argument. He took 26 shots. That’s like Kyrie Irving on an unselfish night. “Stat padding” == hitting shots? Kinda fucked up logic nephews use?
"i just googled ""kyrie irving birth chart"""
These poor Nets fans. Having to survive with just *check notes* Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving
"Yeah I didnt see the ""series he played in"" qualification my bad.   ["" One George-to-Cleveland deal fell apart when the Cavs declined to make a future first-round pick unprotected, a concession they felt they couldn’t make without assurances from James. It is unlikely that the Cavaliers would’ve traded Kyrie Irving with James and George together on the Cleveland roster.""](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/29/report-cavaliers-wouldve-traded-kevin-love-for-paul-george-if-lebron-james-committed-long-term-last-summer/)."
"Yeah in 2014 ... not in 2018. How are you confused about this? It's well documented here: https://theathletic.com/660104/2018/11/19/lebron-james-cavaliers-trading-of-kyrie-irving-was-beginning-of-the-end-of-everything/  He explicitly did not pick the 2018 Cavs, he was under contract and had no choice but to play with them."
"I'm talking Danny Green and their 6/7. You're definitely right, the Sixers have great individual defense. I think for me it's great offense &gt; great defense here. The only matchups I'm aware of so to speak is Ben and Matisse, the other guys are weaker defenders comparably and need to step up.  Seth will be hunted on defense every time he's on the floor, and the Nets passing should be good enough to get out of double teams/find the open man under the basket.  Man Harden is the guy that teams literally had to double at half every time he had the ball. It worked, because he didnt have reliable guys to pass to. Now he has Kevin fuckin Durant and Kyrie Flat Irving. This will not be an easy matchup for any team."
Most of the top players that gets drafted in the lottery past 15 years barely played in college basketball. Each draft class their is less seniors gets drafted in lottery picks. Kyrie Irving only played 9 games in his injured only year in Duke was picked 1st overall.
"Because he has been better recently and because the evidence against Kyrie Irving being a good playoff performer is literally one series. If you think the 2019 semifinals is indicative of the type of postseason player Kyrie Irving actually is without LeBron James, you're just an idiot."
"Then you give guys like Paul George guard eligibility and AD forward eligibility and it throws that theory out the window. It really doesn’t matter if they play those positions some arbitrary % of the time, they still can’t reasonably be compared to guys like Kyrie Irving and Kawhi respectively."

Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving dropped 36 points while fasting on Ben Simmons
Many reasons. They literally don’t have a point guard when its just KD/Irving. Plus alot of those losses came at the beginning of the year and when KD was ramping up and coming back from injury. Plus Kyrie has been fasting the last 3 weeks
Steph and Klay are both better basketball players than Kyrie Irving
&gt;Skills wise maybe  Ok so we are in agreement then. Kyrie Irving is as skilled of a basketball player as AI. Thank you have a nice day.
"FWIW Luka plays with Porziņģis, Kleber, Finney-Smith and Richardson in the starting lineup, while LeBron plays with Schröder and KCP (both guards) and Harden plays with Kyrie Irving an actual PG.   Porziņģis, Kleber and Finney-Smith are all forwards/bigs and do not ever bring the ball up. Richardson is a guard/forward who can dribble here and there but is never asked to bring the ball up. It would be different if Luka was playing with Irving or Schröder who are true guards. Luka brings the ball up every play, and guards opposing guards/wings. He is 100% our PG. Now if we were able to get a player like Paul, Ball, Holiday etc... it would be more of a debate, because he'd share ball handling duties offensively, but would not be guarding opposing guards, thus making him a point-forward.  I think that's the goal going forward, heliocentric offenses hardly ever work in the playoffs (see 05-10 Cavs or 13-18 Rockets). We need a secondary ball handler. Someone like Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball would be great to pair next to Luka."
Kyrie is a SG in a PGs body. He is not nor has he ever been considered anything more then a passable playmaker.  No one is singing Kyrie Irving for playmaking. They are signing him to score.
"How many players you would consider straight better than Gobert?  A ton of players.   But the moment you have to take the more impactful players you'll figure out that Gobert is not the most impactful but he's among the most impactful, way more than players that are just better than him.  Kyrie Irving is having a huge season, high scoring with unreal efficiency and yet there's no doubt that CP3 with his 18-19ppg is way more impactful than him. In fact CP3 proved to be more impactful (not better) than Booker.  with KD and Curry/Harden is the same.   KD is the best player, the other 2 are more impactful for their teams, and overall just look at how teams perform without KD and then without Curry or Harden. I repeat, in KD's career his team overall won 60% of games when he was not playing."

"I never said KD always does, I’m saying he has more consistently than Steph has. At least when KD choked 3-1, he was putting up 30 a game. Steph in his 3-1 choke was getting outperformed by Kyrie Irving.   Regular season wins without each other mean absolutely nothing to me in the context Im saying. Curry is more of a floor raiser, he’s much better at running an offense, but that doesn’t equate to better. The argument isn’t who was more important, it is who is the better player. The player that has the capability to take you furthest is the best player, and KD has significantly more reliably proven to be that player, especially when they played on the exact same team.   In the 2018 finals, KD averaged more points on 9.4% better TS, almost 5 more rebounds, AND MORE ASSISTS. I watched those finals, and so did the media members who voted for KD as finals MVP, and it was obvious who was the best player in that singular series. It was not Curry.   KD in 2012 at the age of 23 had a better finals series than 4 of Steph Curry’s 5. Then, when they played together, KD outperformed Curry during 2 of Curry’s best 3 finals performances. It’s really not that hard."
"The last few minutes of this game was just gross for the Nets. Non stop isos for Durant and Kyrie. Irving also missed another ""you have a ton of time left why are you shooting"" 3 way wide right. Even CWebb as professionally as possible was like ""wtf are they doing run a play ffs"""
Gonna say the team that still has Kevin Durant (and Kyrie Irving) is gonna beat the team whose second best scorer is Kyle Kuzma.
The one with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving???
"Kyrie Irving had 45 points, 5 rebs, 4 asts, 4 steals, 2 blks, 55% from the field, 54% from 3 (7/13) and 4/4 FTs and this is the clip that gets upped. That's really sad tbh."
Playoffs:  Irving – 26/3/5 on 47/37/91 splits  Lowry – 16/3/6 on 46/34/82 splits  Kyrie was better when it mattered.
Kyrie Irving is so damn good
"So much of Harden's tenure was without both Durant and Irving as well, I trust Harden so much more with the offense over the other 2...I mentioned it in the thread but the last non KD/Kyrie basket was at 10:45 in the 4th, it was pure KD/Kyrie isolation afterwards with absolutely no flow in the offense"
How do Irving and Durant combine for 65 and you lose. That's rough.  Looking at this more...how did this even happen? It's not like Kyrie took 45 shots.
"Even if it's a loss, Kyrie Irving is a bad man."
Sucks Kyrie Irving is going to get all the championship glory with Harden and Durant and not Westbrook.
"Yes tell me more about how your role players are equivalent to Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Kyrie Irving or Chris Paul."
2019 ECSF Kyrie Irving type beat
How so?  Is extra rest going to prevent kyrie Irving from falling awkwardly and spraining his ankle??  Is the extra rest going to prevent Jamal Murray from landing on one leg and injured his ACL?  Jaylen Brown landed on his wrist after getting fouled. Had season ending surgery. Can these thing be prevented with rest?  These injuries are Accidents that happen when playing a game. Yeah we don’t talk about other guys on non playoff teams cause they aren’t the ones playing right now.
"Right and if it's only a superstar thing, then the whole narrative should be out the window. Mario Chalmers, Derek fisher, and Kyrie Irving all won championships in the modern era being ""exploitable"" on d. Like Luka would do the exact thing to all of them as he did to Pat Bev. But for some reason they were all able to win multiple championships. That should speak for itself."
"It's not a new phenomenon. Mario Chalmers, Derek fisher, and Kyrie Irving have all recently won championships as bad defenders. I don't know where this ""you can't have a PG liability on d"" came from. It was literally invented to discredit Trae."
"Kyrie Irving, the most beautiful player to watch."
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
"I hear this a lot and it’s really unfair to compare the Warriors injuries in ‘16 to the Cavs in ‘15.   The Warriors lost Bogut, who averaged 12mpg, *after* game 5. Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Barnes and Livingston all played every game.  The Cavs lost Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love for all but one game combined in 2015. They basically played without their second and third best players for the entire series.  These are not comparable scenarios. The Cavs beat the Warriors at essentially full strength. The Warriors beat LeBron with a bunch of bench players who were thrust into starting roles."
Kyrie Irving was born in Melbourne Australia about 15 minutes from where Ben Simmons was born. Weird AF
"Kyrie ""George of the Jungle"" Irving"
"well there's injuries... and then there's INJURIES   like even to the dude you responded to who wrote:  &gt; Like Cavs got injured one year, GSW won. GSW injured, Cavs won.  Draymond getting ejected/suspended for 1 1/2 games is not the same as Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving missing the entire series..."
"If healthy yes, nobody is beating them:   Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid"
"Kyrie Irving was right the earth is flat, lol"
8 all stars should be enough to compete: - Kawhi - Mike Conley - Donovan Mitchell - Joel Embiid - James Harden - Kyrie Irving - Anthony Davis - Chris Paul
Steve Nash is coming back to play point guard; Kyrie Irving retires to become the new Head Coach of the Nets.
"Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Randle all had worse seasons than Jayson Tatum and Donovan Mitchell not to mention that Tatum literally had more All-NBA votes than Kyrie Irving"
How the fuck did Kyrie Irving come anywhere near an All NBA team this year? What a goddamn joke.
"I know it's beyond repetitive at this point, but when it comes to talent, the only team that can stop Brooklyn is the Nets.  Irving out? OK. Harden playing damn near the whole game and yet making one more field goal than you or I? OK. Milwaukee jumping out to a big early lead? OK.   Just didn't matter. Will KD put up another boxscore like last night? I don't think so. If he plays the entire game again, is it possible? Very. He's just that damn good. James will play better. Kyrie will return at some point. Blake suddenly looks like a different player than when he was with Detroit (I know LeBron and KD get knocked for switching teams, but gimme players leaving via free agency after giving it their all over someone phoning it in like Griffin did in Detroit, gut that's a different subject.)"
"I’m also placing Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic over him. Kyrie Irving has a case too, dude kills it on his iso plays. Embiid and Jokic as well... not sure if Giannis is even top 10 worthy."
This is the most kyrie Irving thought I’ve ever thought
this is the most kyrie Irving music I've ever heard
this is the most kyrie Irving shit I've ever seen
art is an explosion - Kyrie Irving
This is art. - Kyrie Irving
&gt;When Harden got injured I was hoping it would be just KD and Irving. I don't consider Kyrie a superstar like KD and Harden so those two make the matchup fair for the rest of the league imo.

They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"""Steve Nash says he won’t rush James Harden back if Kyrie Irving is not able to play in Game 5, or if Harden pushes to play, saying the injuries are “independent” of each other.""  -June 14, 2021"
"If the nets play like they did in games 1 and 2, this will be close.  Surprisingly, it wasn't just having kd and Irving that won them those games. It was ball movement and defense. Somehow a team without a true point guard was doing a great job moving the ball and getting everyone shots.  Of course those shots have to fall, but if they do then this will be a tough game for the bucks.   The nets defense was forcing giannis in to bad shots and they just took turns playing iso. Losing kyrie Irving isn't going to ruin their defense."
LeBron James - Kyrie Irving (2017)  Shaquille O’Neal - Kobe Bryant (2002)  Hakeem Olajuwon - Clyde Drexler (1995)  Michael Jordan - Scottie Pippen (1992)
No one else is a starter on a team normally starting Kyrie Irving and James Harden in the backcourt. Eric Gordon is 2x the player of Joe Harris. Ok man.
"The Bucks are not dealing with nearly as much injuries as Kyrie Irving and James Harden being hurt.  And not all rings are treated equally in NBA discourse. Saying ""a ring is a ring"" ignores that fact."
"Careful talking about fouls, you might invoke the wrath of the Kyrie Irving Defense Force."
"He played the entire 3rd quarter.....and was shooting 50% in the series from the floor with kyrie Irving in the lineup. No one, even lebron James is winning or staying efficient with Mike James/Bruce brown and 99 million salary on the bench"
"No, plain and simple. Just making it to the finals shouldn’t be enough or meet the satisfactory bar to keep someone’s job. Unless he wins, he should be fired. Yes, they would have overcome a lot but the east is only going to get harder with a full year of harden, Irving and Durant and you have to think the sixers make a move too.  They’ve been given (at kyrie and hardens expense) a golden opportunity. They need to capitalize on it"

"@malika_andrews  Kyrie Irving will miss Game 5 on Tuesday with a sprained right ankle, Steve Nash says. Irving had an MRI. Nash adds he has “no idea” whether or not he will be able to return in this series vs. Milwaukee."
"The Bucks won game 3 with Durant and Irving playing and were up like 5 points near half in game 4 with both of those guys.  People decided the series was over after 2 games when it wasn’t. Even with Kyrie it was likely going to be competitive.  Point is, with Harden, KD, and Kyrie they’re likely going to beat any team left pretty handily so that point makes no sense. With KD and Kyrie they’re still a damn good team and the Bucks were starting to show life. Why would people discredit the Bucks for not going through a healthy Nets team when no one else has to either?"

cp3 makes all the difference lol . hes their MVP. booker is like the kyrie irving.
I think Jxmmy did a video about adjusting for Eras and TP was basically Kyrie Irving

"The question wasn't even bad, she just emphasised 'your' in a weird way.  The bit in the question was: ""The Net's lost one of their big stars; Kyrie Irving. He twisted his ankle landing on your foot""  That said, she is a woman, so probably inexcusable."
Dude Giannis is boxing out from a Kyrie Irving push shot. He looks at him as he’s shooting. You seriously gonna argue and say Giannis has no idea who he’s boxing out? Is someone going to pass through Kyrie running 20mph at that point towards the ball?
"I guess we don’t see eye to eye on this but Kyrie was not a top 15 player at the time in my eyes. He was in 16-17 because he made a big jump that year and he just had one of his best if not his best year and is still only a top 15 player at best, no disrespect though because that’s still a big feat. The glaring difference I see is that the backup for Irving was delly which actually ended up working pretty well for you guys, especially his defense, but the backup for bam was Myers Leonard or going small. Also Bam only played 3 full games and went down early in game one. Not the same handicap I agree, but in terms of comparisons, that is the closest one we have in recent memory that ruined two finals."
"That's just blatantly untrue, have you seen how cold the bucks were in the first two games? Or how horrible the offensive schemes were in the first three games? Nets on the other hand had plenty of role players coming up to the task in the first two games, and kyrie irving of course."
&gt; Kyrie Irving? Lmfao  ???
What other allstars???? Kyrie Irving? Lmfao
"lmfaooooo….you’re still making dumb af comparisons.   [just stop bro….we get it, you don’t like Kyrie Irving](https://i.imgur.com/8aaAMv5.jpg)"
"Ya, that is totally the same as James Harden and Kyrie Irving."
I'm Dr. Brian Sutterer and today Kyrie Irving........
"You can still play under the rim, just don't slide you entire lower body in the landing space beneath the person who jumped. In most situations, its not that obvious, but Giannis stuck his entire lower body underneath Kyrie irving, who jumped vertically, not sideways."
On a scale of 1 to 10 how close are you to kyrie irving in term of fitness?
Kyrie Irving is trying to get his teammates to do the we're the Millers prayer right now and they're all thinking about kawhi.  Slinky Durant is jacking off to one of his twitter alts.  Everyone else in the league is too smart to be that dumb.
Yes. Kyrie Irving: innocent bystander.
Some interesting duos of the tonight's game between the Nets and the Bucks.     |Duo|Score (for the Bucks)| |:-|:-| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton|82-51| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Pat Connaughton|53-26| |Khris Middleton + Pat Connaughton|56-31|  &amp;#x200B;  |Duo|Score (for the Nets)| |:-|:-| |Jeff Green + Landry Shamet|15-6| |Kyrie Irving + Jeff Green|8-0| |Jeff Green + Nicolas Claxton|27-21|
Do Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving not exist to you?
"If your team has significant injuries to Kyrie Irving and James Harden in the playoffs you do get to be a bit salty, I think. I think most people see this was accidental."
"If Kyrie Irving really cannot come back and the Bucks pull out the series, who wins a hypothetical Phily Milwaukee matchup"
"You're claiming that Kyrie alone adds 2 wins to the Cavs in a 7 game series. That's an insanely high value to place on Irving, he was nowhere near that good. The Cavs won in that series when Irving was OUT, they lost the 1 game he played in."
"No Nets fan would tell you with a straight face we can win this series without Harden and Irving. We have good role players, but after trading away Levert and Allen for Harden we went all in on the big 3. Hope one can get healthy so we can make this a series.  But the people saying this shows KD is a fraud, and basically commenting as if the Nets are getting exposed, are just absolute clowns. No shit losing without Harden AND Kyrie lmao. Honestly the Bucks should be winning by more."
"Lmao ""no excuses"" when Kyrie Irving and James Harden are hurt, Jeff Green playing his 1st game   Trash."
Kyrie Irving still has the 2nd most points for the Nets
"Yep. Had this same exact thing happen to me in high school ball back in the day, ended up with a broken growth plate and was out for maybe 4-5 weeks. Obviously I wasn’t world class athlete Kyrie Irving, but this doesn’t look good from what I know."
"How ironic that the dude coming off an Achilles tear is on the court giving the Bucks work, while the Iron Man Harden and Kyrie Irving are out"
"So yesterday the nets winning it all is inevitable, but without *Kyrie Irving* it would take a GOAT performance to just get to the ECF?"
"KD isn't missing Kyrie Irving, he's missing his bodyguard"
"Offense is more important than defense, and both 2015 Kyrie Irving and 2015 Kevin Love were net positives when they were on the floor."
Kyrie Irving can now spend time solving world peace or with the flat earth society.
I think Giannis deserves a flagrant for that. Blatantly undercut Irving. Might even be intentional with how little room Kyrie got.
"Giannis was trying to go for the rebound. Do you think he should've tried to rebound from the area where there were no nets players, or from the area with Kyrie under the basket?   He went next to Irving to try and grab the rebound from him, and unintentionally slid his foot under Irving. It should've been a flagrant 1 (someone pointed out that sliding a foot under a shooter should always be a flagrant), but it was not intentional"
If you want to get your kid into basketball direct them to Kyrie Irving. He makes basketball look so cool
"""*I'll spare your career by missing the shot.*"" - Kyrie Irving"
"Ben Taylor, the creator of Thinking Basketball, has a metric called PlayVal, which is described as ""Playmaking value, an estimate of a player’s points per 100 impact from playmaking only.""  According to this metric for the 2020-21 season (regular season), the top 10 players for this stat are:  1. James Harden 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Trae Young 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damian Lillard 6. Chris Paul 7. LeBron James 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Jimmy Butler 10. DeMar DeRozan"
"You won't have an ""alright chance"" of beating a healthy Nets team. It's pure delusion. Kyrie Irving would *easily* be the second best Sixer and it wouldn't even be close. The Nets have three of the top four players in the series and  probably the top two."
"Moments like this are why I don’t blame Kyrie for wanting out. I’m completely sure that he and LeBron get along and are perfectly friendly with one another, but the media circus must be exhausting as hell when you’re no longer seen as Kyrie Irving, but rather, Lebron’s younger sidekick."
"Look. Your team has Kevin fucking Durant, James fucking Harden, Kyrie fucking Irving who is the perfect #2 as their fucking #3, and a fucking insane shooter in Joe Harris who is shooting at an INSANE .48. Not only that, they have a damn good depth.  If the Nets lose without any serious injuries, they deserve to be mocked. But don't worry, they're not losing."
"I feel the same way about the nets. It's just not that interesting when a superteam wins. ""oh wow, the team with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden won. What a surprise."" Itd actually be really cool to see the Bucks win, since Giannis and Middleton have been working on getting there for so long."
"I mean... The guy they got in to be head coach for a Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant had never coached professionally in his life? Sidney Lowe posted a &lt;25% record over two years, got fired, and *still* found another head coaching gig where he played out more than two seasons where he couldn't win more than 23 games?  Sure, I guess I don't know that the standards are higher for women. Who knows, maybe there just aren't any women out there with more coaching qualifications than... None? Maybe there just weren't any women who could do a better job than Sidney Lowe. Sure."
The Kyrie Irving - Kehlani - PND fiasco on Twitter a few years back was pretty hilarious  Edit : Meet me in Temecula was a classic too
KD won 4 scoring titles. The team was always a WCF lock everytime they were healthy and got stopped by injuries. They took out the 67-win Spurs in 6 and were up 3-1 against the Warriors. You really think all of that was because of Durant alone? lol   &gt;Been surrounded with better teammates  There's a difference between playing with good role players and playing with Steph Curry/Klay Thompson/Kyrie Irving/James Harden
"LeBron is better Oscar, Magic, and Kobe?  Kyrie Irving held back the Celtics."
Kyrie Irving was lebron’s best co-star. I don’t think any of his other co-stars could’ve played like he did in 2016
Imagine trying to argue that a team with Kyrie Irving would fire people because they supported BLM a bit too loudly.
"Its only ridiculous if harden was playing, but he's not.  Its 100% true otherwise... unless you think a backcourt of kyrie irving and bruce brown is better than booker and CP3.  And even if harden was playing, this statement isn't that crazy, you can always argue that they are *playing* better, even if the perception isn't that they are better."
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
Kyrie Irving
My hatred of Kyrie Irving and mild dislike of Kevin Durant has made me love James Harden
Tatum was playing with scrubs and single handedly beat two of the greatest players of all time plus Kyrie Irving.        People will talk about it as one of the great solo performances similar to Allen Iverson in the 2001 finals against Kobe/Shaq.
"Plus y’all drafted the unstoppable big 3 of Kyrie Irving, Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins those years."
"russell westbrook, ben simmons, kyrie irving, paul george"
"Steve Nash, Sean Marks, James Harden, Kyrie Irving say no"
Kyrie Irving in shambles
"Not sure why you are downvoted, you aren't saying Kyrie is better than Curry, just that Kyrie matches better against Curry than the other way around.  Seems like people may have forgotten the headaches Irving put Steph through."
Kyrie Irving.  So much so that I don't think his injury cost the Nets the series against the Bucks.  James Harden's injury did however.
"He was never an MVP level talent. To compare to someone in the modern era, he was prime John Wall / Kyrie Irving level. Someone who was one of the best at their position but never an MVP candidate.   The fact he got so many assists was due to using the same move with Malone over and over for 15 years and being lucky that they both were healthy.  He frequently disappeared in the playoffs and got outplayed by worse point guards, similar to Dame nowadays. Lets not forget he was never the best player on his team either.  Ranking him over guys like Nash, Zeke, Kidd, Payton, Russ and CP3 is disrespectful to those guys who all were MVP level guys and lead their own teams."
How about I show you photoshops of KD and Kyrie Irving in Knicks jerseys that you guys made in that offseason before they signed with the Nets and laughed at your franchise? It was really embarrassing.
"If Giannis doesn’t box out Kyrie Irving on a floater while he is still mid air, encroaching on his landing space causing him to turn his ankle almost 90 degrees they aren’t in the finals. I know injuries are a part of the game but he literally caused that injury. Not that it was intentional but still. Obviously the suns had good fortune too but it’s not their fault the clippers advanced over Utah. Leonard didn’t get hurt against them, he got hurt the previous round, and the clippers still beat the Jazz."
Kyrie Irving is better than Lillard
Nets receive: Damian Lillard  Blazers receive : Kyrie Irving and Landry Shamet/Bruce Brown  Dame can guarantee himself a championship IMO if this is done
Kyrie Irving(If you just focus on his basketball ability)
Necessity is different than luxury. To beat the Cavaliers of Warriors didn't need Kevin Durant with their existing roster (they were injured and lost by one minute in G7). But Durant was a luxury and they changed their roster to get him and then he was a necessity to win.   You make it seem like LeBron and the Cavs like he had no help whatsoever. Kyrie Irving Kevin Love LeBron James. All amazing shot creators and their Prime.  You're mixing narratives for the Warriors and KD
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
"Randle takes a step back next season, as does the team defense as thibodeau's style starts to wear on players.  They miss out on all of their big name targets and Thibodeau is fired in the offseason.   Ben Simmons is traded to Portland for CJ which ends up benefitting neither team.  Philly and Portland both end up in the play in tournament.   The Chicago Bulls end up with Kyle Lowry and the number 2 offense behind the Brooklyn Nets and end up with a top 4 seed in the east.   De'aaron fox makes his first all star appearance beating out Shai for the final spot.   Myles Turner leads the league in blocks, makes his first all star appearance and wins defensive player of the year.   The Phoenix Suns make their second straight NBA Finals appearance.   Kyrie Irving gets red hot in the NBA finals as defensive attention is given primarily to Durant and Harden and Irving walks away with Finals MVP."
"I mean it had to happen, I couldn't see the Suns even getting past healthy Lakers w AD, Maybe could of won in 6 or 7 against Murray and Nuggets. No Kawhi and barely survived. Giannis is a top 2 player on the league now, it's not even debatable. He beat great teams on his way to the finals. Nets didn't have Kyrie but they still a better team than Bucks without Irving. Never thought I'd say this but Giannis and the Bucks deserve this ring more. BUCKS IN 6 what a run by Milwaukee!"
"I think the majority of people believe that the teams were fairly even but Durant tipped the scale and ruined everything. Of course there are people who believe the Cavaliers were superior but that’s probably because the breaks that the Warriors had in 2015 far outweigh what the Cavaliers had in 2016. The Cavs still managed to win two games in 2015 with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving being injured which is very impressive.  Being said, I believe the rivalry was amazing to watch until Durant came and made it so one sided that the 2017 and 2018 Finals weren’t even worth watching."
"Never have I ever thought to myself - ""Kyrie Irving is just as good, if not better than Steph Curry"". Much less, ""JR Smith is just as good, if not better than Draymond Green""..."
"Absolutely agree the cp3 has always leaned toward dirty play. (I loved it when he broke his hand slapping down and fouling on the blazers a few years back in the playoffs). However, Giannis is not without his own questionable play. Him running under a prone Kyrie Irving while he’s coming down from a layup and getting his feet under Kyrie’s so that he twisted his ankle on the landing should have been a flagrant"
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
"&gt;I mean kd/steph bron/Irving was a wash  not it wasnt tf. kd/bron a wash, steph/kyrie is not."
"Yup, to me it's not about being international as opposed to the limitations of his offensive game. Luka, Manu, guys like that get the respect because of how they play.  This is kind of reductive, but players tend to respect people like Jamal Crawford and Kyrie Irving, who have a deep bag and can score at all levels.   And compared to guys like Kawhi, LeBron and KD, Giannis is just seen as an athletic freak rather than someone with refined skillset because of his poor shooting. But in reality he can handle the ball and pass really well for his size. If we think of him as a center rather than a small forward, his skill level starts to look more polished compared to say, Rudy Gobert."
"The Cavs were a superteam before LeBron came back????     (And even if Bron didn't come back and it was just Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, I think it'd be a stretch calling us a superteam that season.)     But, whatever, TIL that superteams can go 33-49 and end the season behind the Knicks?"
"Gonna go Cavs just become of my family roots.  Kyrie Irving, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Shaquille O’Neal"
Harden has spent seasons carrying the Rockets and not getting hurt without any Kyrie Irving or Durant at all.  He had his second lowest usage since OKC  Find a better argument.
One Kyrie Irving ankle injury
If only there were some way to predict that Kyrie Irving would get hurt besides reading literally anything about him.
"I wouldn’t bet on a KD-Irving-Harden core being healthy for an extended period of time at all. Shit, Kyrie just flat out doesn’t play when he doesn’t feel like it lmao"
"It's not about you guys passing him, it's about your doctor taking his draft value so he fell to us lmao  Edit - also who the fuck is Kyrie Irving compared to the anti vax KD"
"Isn’t a super team 3+ star players? Like the Nets, or when KD was on the Warriors.  Kevin Durant + Kyrie Irving + James Harden  Stephen Curry + Klay Thompson + Kevin Durant.  I’m not referring to the Clippers here, but some 2 star player teams do give the definition a run for its money though."
"He was passing out to KD or Kyrie Irving, let's calm the fuck down a little"
I agree that people should stop giving Kyrie Irving money. Lmao.
"When you have to act like Jusuf Nurkic missing games was more impactful than Kyrie Irving missing games, you're not a championship team."
Kyrie goes on a boat to have [a party full of white ladies](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwji55ys9ujxAhXGXc0KHS3WAqEQtwIwC3oECAMQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2016%2F06%2F29%2Fkyrie-irving-my-yacht-party-wasnt-racist-i-love-black-women%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vrxzGltWxGveyPUxFDIiC).

"Yo, Lebron, I'm really happy for you, I'm a let you finish, but    Kyrie Irving made a much movie than this."
"Lol Knicks fans are so dumb. Yeah, the same Knicks fans who had a ""we didnt trade Frank Ntilikina for Kyrie Irving Upvote Party"" on our sub. The same Knick fans who thought we shouldnt trade for Chris Paul. The same Knicks fans who thought we should trade Randle for a 1st round pick  Knick fans are more in love with some romantic idea of a team than a team that wins. If we had traded for Paul this year we very well could be in the Finals. The East is wide open. The teams are flawed."
"\&gt;He broke Kyrie's Cavs records for most 3pters made by a rookie.   \&gt;He broke LeBron's Cavs record of most 20 + point games as a rookie, and most consecutive 20 + point games to open a season this year.   \&gt;This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others).  \&gt;Are those all tradeable mediocre players too?  &amp;#x200B;  This isn't ""statistical refutation"" as much as it's post-editing in data-picked factoids that I don't give a fuck about. You still completely refuse to cope with the reasoning as to why the franchises that owned the 22 year old versions of those players wouldn't have dreamed on not extending them, which is so much more telling about what you deep-down know to be true about Sexton's value as a player.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;It's almost as if they need additional pieces to help flesh out their scoring, and like they need a tandem of JAllen, Okoro, and Mobley to provide a solid defensive wall to back up their height disadvantage (and provide some great pick n roll targets).  &amp;#x200B;  If Mobley falls to them, there's probably a slight chance they extend Sexton. I still think they'd much rather re-sign Allen who can fit next to Mobley, and keep that cap space free while rolling with a Garland-Mobley facilitated offense.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;And you're right when have members of the sports media ever been wrong ! /  &amp;#x200B;  What does this even mean? In instances where there is this much consensus smoke, they are right very often.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;Cavs aint the ones trying to shoot loads of cum to hype Sexton for a trade. We just recognize what we have and can provide the stats to prove it. Which is what Ive done consistently and only gotten random opinions in response where no one has yet to explain how we replace our #1 scorer and the 25 ppg and spacing, and gritty infectious attitude, he brings w mid-level draft picks and Obi. No one.  &amp;#x200B;  You can only provide the same singular stat, PPG, and his eFG% and TS% which at least have trended towards league average for a SG that only averages about 4 3PAs a game. You ignore his tendency to ball-stop and really bad defensive fit which help contribute to a bad Net Rating and awful team relative on/off numbers. You also ignore a bad Ast/TO ratio and mediocre Ast% which is discouraging for someone who can reliably break down the defense as much as he can.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;But please give me more opinions I can refute with stats.  You've refuted literally none of my opinions with stats, because my collective feelings towards Sexton already acknowledge that he is developing into a nice three-level scorer capable of being a sole offensive option on a really bad team. It is his holistic package as a player that I am not very interested in.  \&gt;I got karma to burn so prove me wrong w stats or gtfo  &amp;#x200B;  ""muh downarrows"" is cringe enough without ignoring the fact that I'm the one displaying unpopular dislike for a young player that I think has been erroneously labeled as someone that meaningfully moves a team towards championship contention.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't even know why you're taking such offense to this. I'm trying to argue that your team is smart for, rumors have it, choosing not to extend Donovan Mitchell money to a potentially worse version of Donovan Mitchell and for seeing the limited value in that type of player."
"The Warriors take guy was complaining that the KD Warriors were basically in his mind cheated out of 4-peating by Lebron having a ""superteam"" with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving.  The Zion post was someone saying that after seeing Zion's first few games back from injury, there was a chance he could actually be the best player in his draft class which was the weirdest duh post ever."
"All of those stats / accolades are pretty cherrypicked and none of them contradict the comment above you since they're all related to scoring. Maybe you should've looked for something that suggests he's not a terrible defender/passer  &gt; This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others)  This is just obnoxious and could be done with any 1st option player in the league"

"He doesn’t belong between 10-15 either. He’s more 15-20 There’s scorers like him or better who bring more to the table in that range. After the top 11:  Paul George - similar offensive player + good defense and better playmaker  Kyrie Irving - as a scorer, is a better ball handler, 3 point shooter, midrange shooter, and finisher + is a better playmaker  Trae Young - similar scoring numbers but is miles ahead as a playmaker, so he doesn’t have games where he doesn’t make an impact   Jimmy Butler - He had 22/7/7 on All-NBA defense and the best advanced stats of his career this season. I get he struggled in the 4 game sample size this playoffs, but he has shown he delivers in the past.  I’d also take CP3 over him, but I get how Butler and CP3 could be arguable. Booker is in line with Mitchell, Towns, and Beal. Puts him at 15-20"
"Kobe was alway surrounded with more talent than LeBron. Remember Bron was relegated to Cleveland for 6 or 7 seasons before he was surrounded by stars. Kobe won 3 rings with SHAQUILLE ONEAL (an undeniable top 10 and arguable top 5 all time NBA talent) for many seasons. LeBron never had that caliber of teammate until Miami. So LeBron with a young Shaq or LeBron with Gasol/Fisher/ Bynum in their prime might have yielded even better results as LeBron is historically durable. Kobe had injuries that kept him out of entire seasons. That never happened with peak LeBron. Anyone expecting him to Beat curry/KD/klay Thompson without a fully healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love is smoking crack. It’s not a apples to apples comparison because without Shaq, Kobe only has 2 rings. It’s not just Kobe’s mentality to netted him 5 rings he played with elite athletes and was coached by Phil jackson. 2 undeniable variables that can’t be understated and 2 factors LeBron didn’t have until year 7 or 8 in the league. That’s a long time to be losing in the playoffs by yourself. Such was not the case for Kobe."
"Russel Westbrook, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving and James Harden. Thats the people KD built superteams with (not really with Westbrook but he is worthy a mention). You wanna put Ja Morant on a level with those?"
"Replace the ""Klay Thompson"" in the title with ""Kyrie Irving"" and people would be singing a different tune in the comments lmao"
"Not a homer take, but betting on Kyrie Irving to win MVP in his last Boston year was a great one."
"""Shaq couldn't play in today's NBA.""  ""Jordan's Three-in-a-Row will never be repeated.""  ""The Warriors would've won 4-in-a-row if they didn't run into Lebron's superteam.""  ""Could Zion be the best player from his draft class?""  ""Would the Lakers trade Kuzma for Kyrie Irving?""

Bob Cousy is greater than Kyrie Irving but no way he’s better than kyrie
1. Magic  2. Curry 3. Oscar Robertson 4. Cp3 5. Nash 6. Stockton 7. Kidd 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Westbrook 10. Jerry West
&gt;I just have enough data points on Kyrie Irving  Lol
"The thing about pessimism is that when things go wrong, at least you were right.  But I am very much a Celtics optimist. I just have enough data points on Kyrie Irving to form the opinion that he's not a genuine person in the way he interacts with the media. He does great humanitarian work and is probably a cool guy to talk to, but he has a complicated personality (which is not a controversial opinion)."
"*Kyrie Irving will win MVP*  Not really seeing it but because the MVP can be a popularity contest, who knows - maybe Kyrie hires a great promotional firm and can keep fooling people into thinking he's on the same level as Harden and KD.      *CJ McCollum will be an MVP candidate if he gets moved*  Has there ever been a player that's never made an all-star team and gets mentioned as an MVP candidate?      *Russ or Beal will not be wearing a Wizards uniform by the trade deadline*  I could see it      *Kyle Kuzma becomes a legit 3rd option in another team*  Is it a good team? I could see him playing well on a team like the Warriors or Nuggets where they've got some players already. But I don't know about 3rd option.      *Brandon Ingram will be in a Warriors uniform*  You've got me torn on this one. The scoring and the size would be nice but I'm not sure how they could convince NoLa to part with him. I like Wiggins but he doesn't really move the needle.      *Grayson Allen will be an All Star*  Well, it's always good to end with something memorable - like a punchline."
"I stopped reading at ""Kyrie Irving will win MVP."""
Is Kyrie Irving a flat earth? We need to know.
"That's everyone.  The players who were in 2016 and are still at least fringe all-stars but chose not to play are:  Paul George, Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozan, Harrison Barnes, and Jimmy Butler.   I think this team could have used those wing's defense."
Is Kyrie Irving really a flat earth guy or is he just fucking with people?
"Oh sorry that the Bucks lost Donte DiVincenzo, he totally compares to losing James Harden and Kyrie Irving. Look I'm not discrediting the Suns and Bucks, they beat who was in front of them but their injuries just don't even compare to them not having to face a healthy Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard. Those are all arguably top 10 players in the NBA with Lebron, Durant, Harden, Davis, and Leonard usually in people's top 5. They got breaks and the chances of it happening again are slim to none so i don't expect either team back next year."
"Well one of the picks the Clippers traded a while back became Kyrie Irving, so anything is posssibbllllleeeeeeee"
a) It's more accepted than it is in the US b) wtf does that have to do with Kyrie Irving
Episode 7: Why the government wants us to believe in a round world w/ guest speaker Kyrie Irving
"This is the problem with r/nba that people say dumb shit and don’t get checked for it. We HAD bad player development because of Luke Walton’s staff. Now we have had for the last two years the best development coach in all of basketball in Phil Handy. Look at the Kings under Walton and you see their young talent hasn’t quite reached potential, and then look at how literally every NBA player works with Phil Handy. He has been an assistant coach on Nick Nurse’s staff, Tyronn Lue’s staff, and Frank Vogel’s staff. He has and still works with guys like Kawhi, Lebron, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Pascal Siakam, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Spencer Dinwiddie, and countless others that all have sung praises about him. There’s a reason why Steve Nash wanted him on his staff this past offseason and the Wizards were interviewing him for the job this offseason."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot.

You have to delusional to think whoever the Bucks lost was equivalent to losing Kyrie Irving and half of James Harden
Kyrie Irving and Al Horford?
Imagine having to sit through a 50 second Kyrie Irving ad just to watch this game.
"Lmao mine is a dumb take? I'm saying his physical gifts are his best gifts, and you're arbitrarily creating lists of ""Best 6'10""+ dribblers in NBA history"" and ""Best Finishing packages in NBA history for non-guards"". Like what is that Bill Simmons bullshit?   His dribbling isn't that amazing dude. KD is a far better dribbler, for example. But Giannis' massive strides and insane burst speed make his dribbling effective.   And for finishing, yes--it's amazing. But if you're trying to suggest that he's finishing with the same english and finesse as a Kyrie Irving, you'd be wrong. He uses his freakish body to get to where he needs to go, and is strong enough to finish through a ton of contact."

I'm going way out there and say Jamal Crawford.  His ball handling was just ridiculous.  Basically a prototype of Kyrie Irving.
Oooh that's a good one. Storyline-wise I say Neymar = Kyrie Irving.
"Lots of people are saying Lebron = CR7, but a Lebron = Messi comparison is also valid, and then you can also say Kyrie Irving = Neymar. All-time great dribbler, won with the master but then still wanted to strike out on his own."
Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving is so smooth sometimes it’s unreal. I’m convinced that there’s no move he hasn’t mastered
"Chris Paul will opt out his contract to sign a max extension, maybe even a super max. If he wants out of PHO to ensure he gets more titles there are two options  Lakers sign and trade: Schroeder, Harrell, Kuzma, THT, future pick swap for CP3.   Nets sign and trade: Dinwiddie, Harris, Bruce, Shamet, Claxton,  for CP3   Lakers roll out: Chris Paul, KCP, LeBron James, AD, Drummond  or   Nets roll out: Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin  or Suns roll out: Schroeder, Booker, Bridges, Crowder, Ayton with Harrell off the bench  or  Dinwiddie, Booker, Bridges, Crowder, Ayton with Harris, shamet and Clax off the bench"
"Maybe not the worst ever, but there was a rumor that Dion Waiters [requested a trade](http://thehoopdoctors.com/2013/12/dion-waiters-requests-trade-from-cleveland/) from the Cavaliers because [he thought he was better than Kyrie](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/the-dion-waiters-delusion-he-couldnt-understand-why-irving-was-thought-to-be-the-better-of-the-two/)"
"I think Luka was a way bigger prospect than Fultz/Towns/Irving.  He just didn't get projected first because everyone knew NBA teams weren't gonna take him first.  But Luka was a better player than anyone on this list.  I'd say the ranking goes:  1. Anthony Davis  2. Luka  3. Zion  4. Karl-Anthony Towns  5. Kyrie Irving  Fultz was similar tier to Kyrie tbh, as was Ben Simmons.  Embiid would have been fourth on this list if it weren't for injury concerns."
"I can watch Kobe Bryant in the post all day every day.   But dribble moves all inclusive, Kyrie Irving and Steph are definitely up there for me. So incredible smooth with the basketball while being efficient with every dribble.   Tmac is probably my favorite overall in terms of aesthetics though. Smoothest player of all time in my opinion"
Kyrie Irving. My  absolute favorite player to watch.  I used to love watching Jamal Crawford and of course Bean when he played
I’d love to see an hour long compilation of D Rose vs Kyrie Irving layup finishes.
Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving when he's hot
Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving byfar
Watching Kobe play was like watching poetry in motion  Kyrie Irving. Everything about his game is pleasing to watch
Kyrie Irving and his opinions towards the Nation of Islam. That has been the most exciting story to watch.
Kyrie Irving Nation of Islam
Are mods here still deleting posts about the Black Supremecist Kyrie Irving and his hateful ideology?
"You're saying Kyrie is 90% of the shooter and the DEFENDER Klay is and you're calling me a homer????????? Not to mention Klay and Irving aren't really the same type of shooters, Klay spaces the floor more since he moves more constantly without the ball, while Kyrie is more of a Iso 3pt shooter.      Dude stop it lmao, the fact you think Kyrie gives you 90% of what klay does makes your argument void, they do completely different things."
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
Bradley Beal or Kyrie Irving
"Actually other sports have done it.  But this guy explains why Lebron deserved the Finals MVP way better than I could:  *LeBron James is fighting an army by himself. He's probably going to lose, but he's not dying easily.*  James' average line in these NBA Finals is 36.6 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game.  **Only Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and James Worthy** have managed to do that **in a single NBA Finals game** since 1986. **James is doing it every game.** *James is the only person to have 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in that time frame ... and he's done it three times in this series.*  *His 40-point triple-double in Game 5 was the first in decades. James had 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists by halftime, something nobody has done in any game -- finals, postseason or regular season -- since James entered the league.*  James is the Cavaliers' offense. He scored or assisted 16 of their 17 first half baskets, including every one in the second quarter. He ended up scoring or assisting 26 of their 32 field goals.  **He's doing this out of necessity. When James is on the court, the Cavaliers score 97.2 points per 100 possessions. When he is off the court, they score 54.6 points per 100 possessions. THAT IS VERY BAD.**  With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, the Cavs are down their second- and third-best players. None of LeBron's remaining teammates can create his own shots.  J.R. Smith loves trying, but he is woefully inefficient in doing so. Tristan Thompson can score on offensive rebounds, but isn't a great post-up player. Timofey Mozgov works best in the pick-and-roll, which needs James to act as ball-handler. There was one possession in Game 5 where Matthew Dellavedova tried going one-on-one with his defender. It looked like an escaped zoo animal trying to break out of a lasso after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.  There is no course of action for the Cavaliers besides just giving the ball to LeBron over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Against the NBA's best defense, this should end disastrously. But it hasn't been a complete disaster. It's been kind of close.  The Warriors are winning because they're a great team with several great players. Sometimes Stephen Curry is great! Sometimes Klay Thompson is great! Sometimes Andre Iguodala is great! Everybody's great! The Cavaliers have won two games and made two others close solely because LeBron James is playing like a demigod.   By the literal definition of the term, James has been the most valuable player in the NBA Finals.  But if the Cavaliers lose, don't bet on James receiving the award that goes to the most valuable player.  Once upon a time, it was reasonably common for players who put up astounding performances for losing teams to receive championship event MVP trophies, but sometime in the past 40 years or so, that trend fell out of style.  In the NBA, a losing player has only received the MVP once, when Jerry West won the award in 1969, the very first year an award was given. His was as preposterous as LeBron's. He averaged 38 points per game in a seven-game defeat to the Celtics and had a 42-point triple-double in Game 7, the only triple-double with a higher point total in finals history than James' Game 5.  The MLB and NFL have also given out MVP's to losing players just once, and both were a long time ago. The only losing World Series MVP was Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson in 1960. If that series were played now, the trophy would almost certainly go to Bill Mazeroski, who hit a walkoff home run in Game 7. The only losing Super Bowl MVP was Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley way back in Super Bowl V, in 1971.  Hockey players who lose the Stanley Cup are still kind of in the running for the Conn Smythe Trophy, but that's a bit more understandable because it's meant to reward the player with the best overall postseason performance, not merely the best performance in the decisive series. It's been given to losing players five times, with four being goaltenders. But this too is becoming increasingly rare. After two defeated players received the trophy in the first four years it was awarded, only one has gotten it in the past 25 years: Jean-Sebastian Giguere in 2003.  Whether the move away from rewarding losing players is a conscious effort on the part of leagues, a change in the voting procedures or thought processes for participating media or merely a coincidence is unclear. But it is clear that nobody is particularly interested in making an incredibly awkward moment happen.  Picture the scenario of the Warriors winning and James winning the MVP. The confetti-covered Warriors are celebrating their team's first championship in 40 years. It's the photo opportunity of a lifetime, a moment Warriors fans will cherish for decades to come.  And now Adam Silver has to speak into a microphone and tell everybody that none of them was good enough to win MVP. They have to stand aside as somebody goes searching for LeBron. Is he in the locker room? Does he come out, despite being devastated by defeat, to receive the trophy on stage? Does somebody go quietly bring it to him backstage? Does he even want the dang thing? Everybody involved hates it. The LeBron-hating contingent would go apoplectic, convinced once and for all that people will go to great lengths to praise James in spite of his consistent failures.  For these reasons, James will almost certainly need to will the Cavaliers to a win in Game 7 in order to be the NBA Finals MVP. If he doesn't, somebody on the Warriors -- probably Curry, perhaps Iguodala or somebody else depending on what happens in the future -- will get the award.  But let's not forget what James is doing against incredible odds.*"
"Klay Thompson because without him the Warriors are a mediocre team at best (yes I know Steph Curry exists and even though he is on a division rival, I still love his game). Kyrie Irving is a big part of the Nets but when the Cavs didn’t have him, they still made the Finals. Nets didn’t have Kyrie and couldn’t take out the Bucks. I understand that the Cavs had LeBron but the Nets had both Harden and KD to help them. When the Warriors has Klay Thompson, they could have won 5 consecutive Finals."
"&gt;LeBron was gonna wear down no matter who was guarding him- he was forced to carry the team entirely on his shoulders all series.  lebron carried his broken and bum ass team thru the bulls when they were down we had no idea if he was breaking down or not, kevin love broke his arm in the 1st round, kyrie irving was inconsistent as shit and it was unclear if he was really that much of a playoff performer (though he was battling injuries too eventually)"
"Almost like Steph Curry, Lebron, KD, and Kyrie Irving, and possibly the greatest team of all time attracts a lot of viewers. Y'all can complain about those warriors teams forever but fact is a lot of people watched that shit"
"It's  still bothers me Cavs trade Kyrie Irving with an underwhelming players.. Kyrie on Cavs was an Elite Caliber Player, but they just get Crowder, Injured I.T, and the future Pick (sexton). I think they can get more than that."
Do you guys think you would be able to beat James Harden Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving surrounded by shooters and cutters?
"That's obviously not my position. You make the best team that you can, and hope that someone or something else prevents the healthy Nets from stopping you. You obviously still try, I want them to build the best team they can and compete to win championships this year and the next ones. But if your criteria for looking at a trade is 'Will this beat Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving' then you're not gonna find many answers."
"Damian Lillard is another example, he's missed 47ft in his playoff career.  Kyrie Irving was the other notable I could find, he missed 36ft in his playoff career.  Nash is easily the most impressive though, he has the interesting combination of elite ft%, and large number of games played, while still getting to the line so infrequently (3.7/game) that he was able to play 120 games and only miss 44."
"We could have seen Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving trade buckets with Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Ayton instead we get the Milwaukee Bucks..."
Glad we traded the pick that ended up being kyrie irving for him
Despicable team are the nets. Kyrie the earth is flat Irving and carpet bagger Durant along with this doper. No wonder why fans don’t go to their home games.
"PG: Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving (Efficiency is unmatched at guard, 50-40-90 club guys and champions.

The 2022 Nets are going to end up like Mr. Burn's ringer team.    James Harden: Arrested for narcotics in France  Kevin Durant: Hypnotized into believing he's a snake  Kyrie Irving: Fell off the edge of the earth  Blake Griffin: Gets into a car accident while filming a KIA commercial  Joe Harris: Refuses to shave his pubes and gets kicked off the team  DeAndre Jordan: Gets dwarfism eating a special brain and nerve pizza developed by team doctors  Jeff Green: Too buy rescuing people during a hurricane  Spencer Dinwiddie: Knocked out by local oaf over argument about who's the real NY team
"In 2012 the New Orleans Hornets and the Cavaliers finished with the same record, 21-45. They flipped a coin which Cleveland won. The losing set of lottery odds gave the Hornets the first pick and Anthony Davis. Had the Cavs lost that coin flip, LeBron, AD and Kyrie Irving could have teamed up and created a dynasty to rival the KD Warriors."
&gt;I'm Not Lebron James I'm Kyrie Irving  why tf does he have to say this obvious stuff out loud
"You have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden on one team. The only thing that would make it fair is if the Lakers had Kawhi instead of Westbrick.    But for all we know, Kyrie could just end up injured again lmao"
"My favorite mixtape on YouTube is still Kyrie Irving ""I'm Not Lebron James I'm Kyrie Irving"". So fkn good highlights, rookie and sophomore Kyrie was just doing AND1 shit."
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
Kyrie Irving has no business being on this hypothetical team.

1- Kyrie Irving  2- Klay Thompson  3- Michael Porter Jr  4- Kevin Durant  5- Nikola Jokic  Contenders for the greatest offense of all time lol
Yes and no.  Malone helped Stockton way more.  Like someone said above a lot of Stockton’s assists wouldn’t even count as assists today because it would’ve just counted as an unassisted Malone post up or iso bucket.  Imagine if Kyrie Irving averaged 15 assists a game because he passed the ball to KD every possession and KD scored on an iso move after a couple of dribbles.  That’s a good bit of Stockton’s assists.
Kevin Durant : 42 points  Kyrie Irving : 39 points   James Harden: 23 points and 18 assists!

"**How to Talk to Your Dad about the NBA**  Your dad is old. I mean reeeeally old, It’s just one of the facts of life. Here are the facts of life, by the way:  • Your dad is old  • Young Thug is real good   But, back to your dad. He’s old. It’s not his fault that he’s old, but he is in fact very old. The fact that your dad is so old can make it hard to talk to your dad about certain things, stuff like relationships, or electricity. And sometimes, it even interferes with talking to him about the one thing he loves more than all of the stuff he loves more than you; Sports, specifically Basketball.   All dads love Basketball. This is another one of the facts of life, but this fact doesn’t need to be on the list because everybody already knows it. If your dad doesn’t like Basketball, then I hate to break it to you, that’s not your dad (I’m sorry you had to find out this way).   So your dad likes Basketball, but he’s old, so even if you also like Basketball, it can be hard to talk to him about Basketball for any amount of time without him bringing up “the old days” (which he loves because they’re old, like him.) So you came to me. I’m gonna teach you how to hold a conversation with your dad about ball, without him boring you to actual, physical death with old stuff that doesn’t matter anymore. Ok, let’s get started.    **STEP ONE:** Call Your Dad  The first step to talking to your dad is calling your dad on his phone (probably a rotary). If you don’t have your dad’s phone number then he probably doesn’t want to talk to you about anything in the first place, so I would just leave him alone, or hire an impersonator to impersonate your dad for the purposes of this guide.  **STEP TWO:** Greet Your Dad  This one should be pretty self-explanatory, but it takes some finessing. The key here is to properly greet your dad and engage in an acceptable amount of small-talk to lead into a conversation about basketball, but not giving him so much time before the basketball conversation begins that he starts rambling about Polio and The Dust Bowl. My personal advice is to pretend you are currently playing basketball in order to create a smooth transition to basketball. My dad-greetings usually go like this:  Me: Hey Dad  Dad: Hey there son  Me: Hey dad I’m playing basketball, you like basketball right? I’m playing it.  Dad: Yes of course I like basketball, why are you calling me while playing basketball?  Me: cheering crowd oh I just had basketball on my mind and figured we could talk about basketball buzzer sounds  Dad: Of course, son.  **STEP THREE:** Start Slowly  Ok, now for the real stuff. Your dad loves basketball, but he’s old and doesn’t understand what makes basketball great these days. At the beginning of the conversation, don’t bring up things like analytics or three-pointers, because your old dumb dad doesn’t know what those things are. Pretend that you’re Charles Barkley and, as far as you know, basketball has stayed exactly the same since 1961. Begin with a slick reference to someone like Doctor J or another dead guy that your dad probably played basketball with. He will appreciate it, and his inferior old brain will be tricked into thinking that you’re also old, because why would a cool young person ever bring up a geezer like Doctor J.  **STEP FOUR:** Use Wikipedia  It’s imperative to keep Wikipedia open at all times while talking to your dad about basketball, just in case he mentions something like “The ABA” or “The Seattle Supersonics”. When he starts talking about this stuff that you cannot comprehend because it existed so long ago, just read the first sentence of the wikipedia article on the subject. Example:  Me: Man, that Kyrie Irving has some great handles, huh?  Dad: Yeah, he reminds me of Isiah Thomas in that way  Me: Oh yeah, Isiah Lord Thomas III, the American Retired Basketball player that played 12 seasons in the National  Basketball Association. I think what I like the most about Isiah Thomas is that he was an NBA all star 12 times and won 2 NBA Championships. His nickname was the “Babyfaced Assassin”.  Dad: Wow, we both know that information. How cool.    **STEP FIVE:** Don’t Mention Steph Curry  WHATEVER you do, do NOT mention Steph Curry. Dads hate Steph Curry, because he’s young and cool and is still married (unlike your dad). My advice: whenever you would normally mention Steph Curry in a basketball conversation with a cool, young human, replace the words “Steph Curry” with “George Gervin” when talking to your old man. I don’t actually know who George Gervin is, but your dad will love it. Here’s an example for you:  Dad: Who do you think is the best 2-point shooter of all time? Wow that was weird, not sure why I said 2-point shooter seeing as 2 is the maximum amount of points you can make with a basket from anywhere on the court, so specifically saying “2-point” was unneccessary.  Me: Honestly, I’d have to give it to 2014-2016 MVP George Gervin, what a talent he is. He drains half-court shots like they’re layups, It’s like nothing the NBA has ever seen. George “Chef” Gervin is easily the GOAT shooter.  Dad: George Gervin with the shot, boy.  **STEP SIX:** Give Him Your Top 2  With any young person, you would normally go on and on about each other's top 5 list, but it’s different with dads. See, there were only 2 good basketball players before your dad stopped understanding what basketball was, so all dads only ever have a top 2 list. The 2 players on the list are always Michael Jordan (From SpaceJam) and Larry Bird (From Indiana), the only thing that changes between lists is what order you put them in. Personally, I know my dad hates all bulls (ex-matador), so his list goes:  1. Larry Bird  2. Michael Jordan  Just make sure you know what order your dad’s list is in before you bring up the top 2 list. Getting this part wrong could ruin your relationship with your father, which is already pretty bad.  **STEP SEVEN:** Say Bye to Your Dad  This is the easiest part of the whole guide, because by now I’m almost positive that you’re sick of talking to your old dad. The best way to end the conversation with your dad is to silently hang up right as he starts talking about “The Golden Age” (It’ll happen, trust me). Because he has bad, old hearing, he probably won't even notice you hung up on him, so it's a win win. You get to not talk to your dad and he gets to keep rambling about fundamentals, victimless.  **STEP EIGHT:** Repeat  Wait 3 months, and then call him again. This is exactly the amount of time necessary between phone calls that your dad’s brain (with its fading capacity for memory) will have forgotten about the last conversation you had with him, but it’s not so long that he’s forgotten that you exist and stops sending you money “for groceries”.  Anyways, be smart out there, and tell your dad I said “defense wins championships”. He'll love it."
In my humble opinion kyrie Irving is more fun to watch. His bag is more ridiculous
Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving  Russell Westbrook  James Harden

Lmfao James Harden played two games and was basically a pylon because of his injury. Kyrie Irving missed half the series.
They sure as shit aren't James Harden or Kyrie Irving
"No, Kyrie is so much better than Russ and Russ’s lack of shooting and ball dominant style makes him a clunky fit on a team where he’s clearly the third option.  For all the issues with Irving, if he’s your second or third option and can play more of a sg/6th role, he’s a monster. He’s probably one of the most underrated offensive players in the nba. When he’s locked in, he’s a monster."
It is well documented. https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2021/05/25/kyrie-irving-racist-fans-quote/
"&gt; Three of those 33 players -- James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook -- will likely never see free agency. Harden and Irving are on track to sign long-term contract extensions before the season starts."
kyrie irving
Kyrie Irving prime isn't even better Durant's non prime
"*At full strength* is a big stipulation when you have Kyrie Irving as a teammate.   His teams have made the playoffs each of his last SEVEN season, and he has only stayed in through the end of the playoffs 3 times.   This kind of rhetoric just offers a built excuse for failure.  ""Oh... we were hurt.""  We get it. ""What if.""  We don't care about ""What ifs.""   We care about which team is hoisting up a banner.   Hearing players sit back and diminish what other teams accomplish with comments like ""If we were healthy...""  Yeah... and if you weren't playing with two other franchise players, you'd be getting your asses handed to you.   And even when you are, you still get your asses handed to you and have to come up with excuses."
"I don't think anyone is pretending like the blazers are a good defensive team. But teams that are not obnoxiously deep can't typically guard every scheme well.look at the bucks which were the best defensive team in the playoffs: Pg tucker was the best Defender against KD and he was bad against the hawks. Brook Lopez completely locked down bam adebayo and he was a liability against quick guards in the p&amp;r against the hawks, suns and Kyrie Irving. There are few guys in the league who can adjust against everybody and no team is able to stack them.    For the jazz the problem was Golbert offense not his defense. No player in the NBA history can guard five guys in the perimeter who can take their opponent off the dribble and shoot threes at 39%+ , and protect the rim because everybody else was getting beat.  If he dunked on them every possession they would have changed that offense real quick"
a simple google search would show different articles demonstrating ways to land KD. The celtics had the resources to at least entertain the idea but clearly the FO had different plans.  https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2019/02/17/kevin-durant-trade-look-like-boston-celtics-kyrie-irving-golden-state-warriors/  https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/03/07/windhorst-proposes-st-deal-that-would-bring-kevin-durant-to-boston/
"The East has never been weak at the PG position, what kind of bullshit is this?  Kyle Lowry  Kemba Walker  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Isaiah Thomas  Trae Young  Ben Simmons  These guys have all been All NBA caliber PGs at some point in recent memory despite playing in the east."
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
"It depends on the teammates to be honest. On average, stats drop when playing with LeBron but that isn’t the bigger picture. The team overall improves but players individually have to sacrifice their level of responsibility and role in order to play with LeBron. A lot of players need the ball in their hands to get into rhythm and you won’t get that with LeBron. Primary playmakers will have a dramatically reduced role. Shooters will have to settle for way more catch and shoot opportunities over iso, screens, pull ups. That’s why Love fell off so hard after being a first option volume scorer. The coach didn’t run plays for him at all, or was LeBron, sometimes Kyrie, and Love got to shoot kick outs from LeBron’s dribble penetration. Same with players like Irving, Schröder, etc.   LeBron does make certain players better. Like AD, because AD doesn’t handle the ball, he doesn’t need to dribble to get in rhythm, he need a facilitator to unlock his game.  If the team is shit, I’ll definitely take LeBron over KD, there’s no way KD can score enough on his own to win. If the team already has a good roster and especially a good playmaker like Harden, Steph, Jokic, CP3, I’ll take KD over LeBron."
"It’s crazy how injuries have such a huge impact… Not just with the outcome of games, but the perception on players legacies… Giannis was a Kyrie Irving injury away from being labeled as a huge choker and his coach probably getting fired… If we’re being honest, the Bucks more than likely lose to the Nets in the second round if Kyrie doesn’t land on Giannis’ foot… Same with Kawhi back in 2019… The Raps more than likely lose to the Warriors if KD or Klay doesn’t go down… After that series, fans and the media were hyping up Kawhi on how he may be a top 10 player of all time… Even though he had been an all star only like 4 times… Giannis and Kawhi both won two of the luckiest titles ever… Don’t get me wrong, they played great to win those rings… They just played some teams that didn’t just have 1 superstar go down, but multiple superstars at the same time…"
"Also it’s fucking Kyrie Irving, he wasn’t out there putting the clamps on Giannis or some shit. Giannis being terrible in game 2 and Kyrie being on the floor have absolutely nothing to do with each other."
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
It was stephs team and he wasn’t getting credit for superteam rings so he wanted to try and win on an underdog team with role players like James Harden and Kyrie Irving
"So there exists only 1 super team? The Warriors? That’s laughable. It’s all semantics and subjective to biased opinions then. Again, look at what the league was doing, Celtics with KG, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce was the Super team of their time just not labeled. The Lakers and other teams did the same.   Lebron bailed on Cleveland why? Why didn’t he just push forward n win it then? Because he wanted to start Ring chasing with the best odds… look at the intentions and moves. Lebron, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love is a super team. Are we just arguing semantics and minor details here? To split hairs so we can dump 100% of the super teaming on Durant while forgetting all context of every other Franchise trying to super team? Or just excuse Lebron?   Lebron crushed the East for how long with Super teams? Take out Lebron of his teams huh? So why not just take Curry out of the Warriors, Kd with Klay and Dray isn’t a Super team either just an extremely great team led by Durant in that case  I applauded Lebron for leaving Cle the first time, he was smart enough to know he can’t carry alone. The league is trending towards stacked super stars and super teams at the time. He was a genius to orchestrate his OWN super teams on HIS terms. And then he can bail on the franchise (Cle, Mia, Cle) n let them sink of swim. The Warriors were a self made “super team” and Kd joined it. So he had it easier than Lebron having to put together a super team, so what? If I recall at least KD left the Warriors but let them work something out of it. Lebron just nopes the fuck out on the franchise with no help on the future I think."
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about that. There aren’t many good free agents available and the projected cap increase is going to mean that teams have money.   I just looked at available 2022 free agents and outside of James Harden (PO), Bradley Beal (PO), Kyrie Irving (PO), and Zach LaVine, Terry Rozier might arguably be the best unrestricted free agent available. The only guys he’s really competing with is Aaron Gordon. It’s a pretty empty free agent class. Everyone is just re-signing with their original teams.   **TL,DR:** There aren’t many good free agents next year. Outside of Harden, Beal, Irving, and LaVine, Terry Rozier might be the best UFA available. His only real competition is Aaron Gordon."
"Donte DiVincenzo  Kyrie Irving and/or James Harden  Yeah, super important. Completely changes the situation 🙄"
"Kyrie Irving for:  *Kyrie, where’s LeBron??* *SUCK MY DICK*"
All Nets injuries did was make the series genuinely fair. They are a literal cheat code and barring injuries it would be embarrassing for anything less than a ring every year. Individually KD and Harden can will a team to a deep playoff run. You can even argue that KD automatically puts a team in contention talks. Put them on the same team along with Kyrie Irving and you have a ring printer.
"Kyrie Irving was a very early investor in Cresco Labs, but this is not public knowledge."
Laughs in Kyrie Irving
"I really can't understand you people. When he went to Brooklyn it was only him and Kyrie afterwards. It's not like they had Griffing, Harden, Irving and he just went there for the championship. When Harden said he wanted to go to Brooklyn what should've Durant done? Throw a tantrum and leave to Sacramento?"
"that's fair, i have no idea how Klay is going to look after 2 years away. but i think Thompson's defense puts him above Kyrie, even though Irving is a vastly better playmaker and shot creator.  i just judge the impact from scoring roughly equally. Klay relies on someone else to create shots for him, but when he goes nuclear it's game over. Kyrie creates for himself with frankly otherworldly talent, but it's a moot point if he gives up 75% of the points he scores on the other end"
Kyrie Irving somehow still hasn't turned 30.
"The kyrie Irving, his whole “ball on a string” handles package is pretty much illegal"
"Nice effort in this writeup, but 2000s had an entire generation of players with offensive bags like Kyrie Irving? Even if it were accurate, is that supposed to be a good thing? There's a reason 2000s offense was [the worst of any decade in the 3pt era](https://aminoapps.com/c/nba/page/item/year-by-year-league-average-ts/wKgr_EQQspIBPl0l71boaZNMVpbqLvabKb0), and Kyrie Irving is closer to the 25th best player in the NBA than, say, the 5th.  Also, Kobe was athletic but more in a body control and fast reflexes way. He wasn't especially explosive, strong, or even that fast. In no way was he  stronger than James ""I'm a better post than perimeter defender because nobody can move my thicc ass"" Harden."
"To reduce the offensive skills of Harden and Kobe to ""efficiency and playmaking"" versus ""floor raising and off-ball movement"" is vastly oversimplifying their offensive games.  Harden in his prime operated best from:  * The top of the key, operating off the pick and roll where he could:  * hit the roll man (for example, Capela for lobs)  * make the skip pass  * punish the pick and roll big man defender by attacking the paint   * drawing fouls   * hitting floaters  * the midrange (sometimes via the high post), which went away during the D'Antoni years * **his most lethal and signature attack** nowadays is his above the 3 point line isolation game, where he can hit the defender with a flurry of dribble moves to set up a step-back or drive-and-kick.  Kobe's offensive arsenal had more variety, which is partly a product of his time and coaching (Jackson's system). Early 2000s ball emphasized isolation ball, and players like Kobe, T-mac, VC, Iverson, and others who grew up emulating Jordan had some of the most polished and varied isolation games since Jordan. These are the kind of guys who would destroy modern players in 1vs1 simply because of their arsenal. Think an entire generation of guys who had offensive bags like Kyrie Irving.  Kobe could attack from:  * high post, as an initiator of the triangle. He often strayed from the triangle in this position to Jackson's chagrin and let his creativity go to work. * mid post, in isolation with his fadeaway, or as a playmaker in the triangle * low post, especially against smaller guards. Kobe had lethal footwork, surprising strength, and more post finishing moves than the average big man. * pic and roll, especially later in his prime with Pau Gasol. See the 2008 spurs, 2009 magic series where Kobe torched teams with his mid-range, drop-off passes, and amazing finishing against all-time great big men like prime [Tim Duncan](https://youtu.be/5aXVxcLm2qQ?t=324) and [Dwight Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xilW4WiS1Qo). * off ball * 3 point line isolation  There's honestly not enough space to really dive into his entire arsenal. Each of these bullet points could be a whole Kobe masterclass. As I mentioned above, both of these guys are a product of their times. If Harden were in Kobe's era, he would've flourished under the triangle, and if Kobe were in Harden's era, he would've worked on his 3-point shot more. To me, it comes down to their natural gifts, which are really subtle and hard to say definitively.  In my opinion, Harden is the naturally better:  * pure shooter - especially with Kobe's two-shot motion being less reliable. * unselfish team player - Kobe would shoot his team out of a game before passing (and not always because of the triangle) * dribbler - Harden's tight dribble package is phenomenal and his footwork in these positions is really tight  But what Kobe had over Harden was:  * strength - Kobe was just a bit bigger and stronger without sacrificing much if any speed to Harden * leaping ability - Kobe's body type was lankier, which translated into better leaping (especially early in his career) whereas Harden was never the highflyer Kobe was. Kobe's paint attacking was truly amazing and on another level than Harden's. Harden makes up for some of it with his foul-drawing prowess, but against smart, vertical big men Harden struggles compared to Kobe. * cutting and activity - Kobe's motor especially earlier in his prime was amazing to watch. He would physically wear out defenders by coming off of rub screens, posting them up, coming off of screens, and fighting for offensive rebounds. In his prime he was one of the best-conditioned players in the league. * transition - again, Kobe's leaping ability, physicality, and motor made him one of the best transition scorers especially early-prime.  To me, Kobe's era-independent strengths give him the slight edge over Harden. Prime Kobe's modern-day best comparison would be a combination of Kawhi's lethal midrange and post game, combined with Paul George's excellent pick and roll finesse, Booker's off ball game, while also being a top 5 highflyer."
"Never make the Kyrie Irving trade.   And to clarify, not because it was a bad trade. It was a great trade that you do 10/10 times, even with hindsight. But because the basketball gods decided to curse us ever since that trade. The luck we've had since then is comically poor."
"Jackie MacMullan recalls a conversation with Kyrie Irving where he stated that there should be no NBA draft because players aren't **property**, and MacMullan replies ""yeah you are dude, that's the way it works. that's why you get paid all these millions.""   this woman is a writer she knows how to uses a. thesaurus to convey different words through her excellent written pieces. which she has done for like 30-40 years. it should be second nature to her NOT use the word PROPERTY when talking to a black individual. especially when she been friends and colleagues with all these players for decades. most african american would not want to be called property ever.  this isnt some young writer who only been in the industry for 5 years. she followed bill russell and magic/kareem duo. she has experience with prickly individuals and people who like being spoke to a certain way. she knows she has to speak with intentionality. she should be an expert with off the cuff conversations  since that what she did for her job in the 80s and 90s. thats the only way to get good stories which she wrote a ton of."

"&gt;    you crazy bro, if you were a GM, you would keep an injured undersized PG over kyrie irving in his prime?   And if you aren't talking about the trade, but playing through the injury. He has the team doctor and his own doctor for a second opinion. I hate what happened to IT, but you make it seem like everyone could predict exactly what would happen if he played.  He may have never fully recovered from this injury if he sat out too."
&gt; knowing they were just going to ship him out as soon as possible  I’m as much on the Ainge overrated train as anyone but this is just grasping for straws.   When a player on the level of Kyrie Irving becomes available for an injured extremely small PG entirely dependent on athleticism you make that trade 10/10 times.
Kyrie Irving
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense— some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange— I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"
"&gt;“We not trippin' off school. We not dumb. We know how to learn. We don't need school. And school not even teachin' you shit—what the fuck is school?”  I'm not referring to fucking Stranger Things you numbskull.  &gt;What do you even mean by red flag? What exactly about his comment makes him an idiot? Why does Kyrie have anything to do with LaMelo talking about Stranger Things?  A red flag is a warning. He's clearly anti-intellectual in the same vein as Kyrie Irving. They are both idiots. The difference here is that Kyrie has just enough education to be dangerous because he sounds smart, but he's living a delusion of his own making. LaMelo is clearly spouting some dumbass shit saying School doesn't teach you anything, which is fundamentally false.   This same dude didn't know that Michigan and Pennsylvania are fucking states. That's some dumbass shit. You learn that when you're like 6-10 years old. You literally can't pass a grade in a number of places if you don't know the states.  &gt;I’m not calling you racist but at best this comment comes across as really fucking harsh and dismissive towards someone for talking casually about their interests. At worst yeah this looks like a dog whistle.  You're not calling me racist, but you're saying i'm dog whistling? That's calling someone racist. Do you even know what you're saying?"
The Kyrie Irving school of life right there
“We not trippin' off globes. We not lazy. We know how to watch YouTube. We don't need solar systems. And science not even teachin' you shit—what the fuck is a sphere?”  -Kyrie Irving
"The spotlights are gonna be on KD vs LBJ, AD vs Harden and Westbrook vs Mills.   Kyrie Irving commentating."
"Wow he's dumb. Could have gotten such a quality education at one of the nation's top institutions like Duke, for free. Look where it got Dr. Kyrie Irving."
"Yeah, but two of those is a scoring God, an all time great who averaged the most per game of any player in among time.  Another is the kinda guy who puts up enough shots to score 50 each night but one night has 4 the next has 23 then 55 then 6.  And the third is a first ballot hall of famer kyrie Irving."
"Regarding Kyrie irving, I only hated him in 2016 but even the Flat Earth thing doesn't really bother me for some reason."
"Kyrie Irving should be on top of this list. He gets overrated because of the flashy playstyle and sick ball handling, but otherwise, he is not really a winning player and will never be a #1 option"
"Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook."
He was a phenomenal GM until Kyrie Irving. He was terrible ever since.
No i mean actual nba players.....  Look at any podcast that's showcases real nba players...they all admit how talented kyire irving is...i can't believe you don't see it with the eye test alone...kyrie is beyond nice.. Trae special too but kyrie is that dude
"I think even though Phoenix didn’t win the ring, they had way better injury luck this year alone. Kyrie Irving got injured in the Warriors first championship win in their recent run.   For comparison, the Suns ran through a few playoff teams while they were injured. The Raptors ran into no other heavily injured teams. Of course losing Kevin Durant is a huge loss to any team, but the fact is that Golden State team was built extremely poorly for when one of your stars went down. Besides the splash brothers and Dray, nobody provided over 10 points a game. In addition, Klay was the only player on that team to shoot above 35% from 3 on that entire lineup. This was an evident team issue.   In addition people like to bring up Klay getting injured as well, but he missed 14 minutes in a 288 minute playoff series. That’s like 5% of the entire series when put into perspective. You could argue they win that game if Klay was healthy and that series gets extended to game 7 but realistically it was a close game and could’ve gone both ways. It’s fair to say if KD was there, they probably win, but I will never see how this was injury luck. The team was very poorly built and when you compare the players they had for bet minimums to what the Lakers have done this year with their minimums, you can see a very real structure problem"
"Starters:   Ben Simmons   Kyrie Irving   Brandon Ingram   Zion Williamson   Anthony Davis     Bench:   Ja Morant   Victor Oladipo   Karl Anthony-Towns     I'd consider swapping KAT and Zion in my starting lineup, let Ben start so Morant can avoid injury and be the spark off the bench. Dipo over John Wall for a bit of length and defense."
"Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Brandon Ingram  Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis  Off the bench:  KAT, Ben Simmons, Deandre Ayton"
Kyrie Irving / Ja Morant   Anthony Edwards  Brandon Ingram  Ben Simmons / Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis / Deandre Ayton    tbh seems like it's mostly big men and point guards ... not a lot of wings to choose from
"Before we start just naming players, let’s think about what kind of skillset we’re looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won’t really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn’t expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I’d be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn’t need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don’t think he’s the WORST player (he’s very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I’m hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he’s obviously young and still developing, so we don’t know what he’ll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6’5”, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous “Big Body.”   P.S. Another interesting question is who’s the BEST player who WOULDN’T succeed on a team of clones of himself. I’d be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it’s hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn’t still win, given the immense amount of talent present."

Brandon Jennings was a special player to me. Definitely somebody that I thought would be what Kyrie Irving is today.
"healthy Kyrie Irving is just underrated.  I’m not gonna go through the exercise of figuring out which player exactly he’s better than, but he’s a 50/40/90 27ppg guy with the coolest handles basically ever."
"It fully depends on Wall and Irving accepting roles as the clear facilitator(Wall) and the scorer(Irving). It would kind of be what we see between Harden and Kyrie. Obviously, Harden is a very different player from Wall, but, I think if there’s a clear understanding of the defined roles, I see it working really well.  I think Westbrook would work well too. They don’t need an elite big. The Warriors are so good at taking bigs out of games, even the best ones in the game. You need dudes who can take the guards off the dribble, and John Wall would definitely be a guy who could do that in 2017."
You think multiple time All Star Kevin Love and multiple time All Star Kyrie Irving were trash? The lengths people go to pretend that LeBron has never played with anyone good is nuts.
I still think prime John Wall &gt; prime Kyrie Irving.
I think Draymond is a better asset for his teams than Kyrie Irving.
"Kyrie Irving. A++ ball handler, but the combination of injuries, constantly being second in command, and never finding a “forever team” / dedicated fan base will make history forget his dominance quickly."
"Kawaii, Jimmy Butler, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, Kyrie Irving, and as much as it pains me Beal"
"About 6 years ago I played pick up with a former D1 defensive specialist (I think he played as a 2 mainly) who recommended the same thing.   His observation was that casual-&gt; lower level competitive players can't handle the slightest bit of basic defensive pressure because the handling isn't good enough, so learning efficient presses and stealing the ball requires way less effort than trying to be kyrie irving every possession. Top tips were: dribble 2-3 times max before the pass or a shot, keep it low and away, and use the off arm to create space against the reach around.     Dribbling the ball high is only worth it if you're about to jack up a shot, which made sense after being told that lol. I used to bounce that shit nearly up to my waist, and he robbed me like 4 straight possessions."
Kyrie Irving has the second best handles in league history.
Kyrie Irving
"Ben Simmons AND Donovan Mitchell are both better already than Kyrie Irving ever has been. Flashy moves that don't result in winning basketball I have never been a fan of. I truly believe Kyrie is the most overrated perennial all star of the 2010s/2020s. His winning percentage without KD Harden or LeBron is like 44%. And that includes all the games he spent on a really deep Celtics team that had a better winning percentage without him. Truly awful when your entire career has been in the East. He has proven in my eyes that he is not a winning player and never will be. Donovan Mitchell is the definition of a winning player. Simmons too despite his lazy work ethic, if he just puts in that work he could really be special."
"(Ik this is really long but I tried to explain as best I can) Ever watched the Warriors? There are still definitely teams such as them that play more or a team oriented basketball it’s just the offensive talent in the league has evolved and the game and spacing and subtle rule changes have allowed isolation players the freedom to thrive in the NBA I promise there weren’t too many players in the 80s with the offensive skill of a James Harden, Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, or a Kevin Durant and as for the Spurs they didn’t really have a primary go to scorer with elite offensive talent (at the guard spot) so they had to utilize a ball movement oriented system to maximize the talent on the roster"
"&gt; ""Hermetic Friends, Inc. My light Brothers and Sisters! The age of No More Secrets is upon us. World Peace will be achieved in our life time and we better Effin believe it!

Kyrie Irving
"“If he wins with another stacked team with an MVP as his co-star, and Kyrie Irving as his 3rd, he’s top 10.”   This and people saying Lebron James is the GOAT are laughable"
"Came here to say this. I’m sad he didn’t get more time in GS to really flourish (and I think GS title chances were much higher with Dlo rather than Wiggins, though the trade makes sense), but this kid just needs a chance and some consistency/direction to really polish his game. He’s got crazy handles, a smooth shot and makes some outstanding passing reads (along with some bone headed ones too, but he’s still 25). He could be a Kyrie Irving type player in the right situation. Can you imagine if the lakers kept him instead of swapping him for Kuzma? Back court of him and Russ would be a blast to watch."
Kyrie Irving
"Check my comment reply in this thread homie. He has a Facebook video talking about Brother Ben X being one of the people he looks up to and associates himself with, who considers himself a “Student of Farrakhan,” and tweets NOI talking points.  Labeling Kyrie Irving as an anti-Semite is not fair, because he has not directly said anything about Jews, so I apologize for the incorrect label.   However, the people he associates himself with are anti-Semitic, full stop, and the language he tweets reflects their anti-Semitic views. I can’t prove anything he says is regarding the Jewish people, because he doesn’t say it by name, but in my opinion that’s what he’s referring to."
"The late 2000s/early 2010s was around the time when I was really hung up on the idea that it was extremely rare for a PG to be the top guy on a championship winning team, so teams should instead go for SGs or forwards with extremely high ceilings.  I supported Michael Beasley over Derrick Rose, Evan Turner over John Wall and Derrick Williams over Kyrie Irving. I am not a smart man."
"&gt;I'm trying to remember when the idea that ""LeBron needs better teammates"" was unjustifiably argued.  I mean, I can remember quite a few times.  To wit, half the people I talk to barely remember that Kyrie hit a fairly amazing important shot in Game 7.  Most don't remember that Kyrie scored 40 points in a key Finals game.  They all remember the LeBron block though, and the things LeBron ""had to do"" to win the championship.  Replace ""Irving"" with ""Pippen"", and ""LeBron"" with ""Jordan"", and people here would be writing operas to how amazing Pippen was that series."
 (Kyrie Irving)
"He’s had Dwade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, AD, and Kevin Love."
"Yeah man, having Kyrie Irving instead of Delly on the court undoubtedly changes that series.  It has nothing to do with the matchups the Spurs struggled with.  The Cavs couldn't score with Lebron on his own."
"Big 3 of the most hated players in the NBA as of this moment. Andrew Wiggins, Ben Simmons, and now Kyrie Irving."
1. Ben Simmons fires Rich Paul by December 2. Klutch Sports put on some sort of probation by the league office 3. Two or more teams have draft picks stripped for tampering 4. Kyrie Irving retires
"The Nets have had tons of point guards. Assuming we go by their peak, I'd go something vaguely like...  1. Jason Kidd 2. Kyrie Irving 3. Michael Ray Richardson 4. Deron Williams 5. Kenny Anderson 6. Stephon Marbury 7. Sam Cassell 8. Devin Harris  Don't hold me to this, I thought of it right off the top of my head, I'm sure I forgot some people too."
"Mark Price, Kyrie Irving, and... Mo Williams or Ron Harper"
"Serious question:  At the end of Game 7 of the NBA Finals, down by 1 on the road with three seconds left, who do you want to have the ball in his hands? Kyrie Irving or Mike James?  ~  ~  Mike James, because Kyrie won't take the shot."
Kyrie Irving should be more careful. This is why he never finished the season. Trying to step on players feet so they can't get rebounds is shameful.
And nets fans blindly defend Kyrie Irving like he’s paying y’all. Maybe you should direct this energy to a team with players that understand elementary school science
Kyrie Irving has evolved into poutine!
So glad we don’t have dumb “the earth is flat” “mask off” pseudo intellectuals on the Knicks that are putting themselves before the team. *Cough* *cough* Kyrie Irving.
"As we get closer to training camp, I feel like Kyrie Irving is about to become the main headline. As will Andrew Wiggins."
I for one am shocked the flat earther Kyrie Irving is also antivax
"why are you trying to speak for others? clearly wiggins is a filthy trump-supporting anti-vaxxer, same with his non-buddy kyrie irving. they will never get vaccinated because they're too right wing to."
"when Kyrie Irving is there mentally, hes prolly better"
"Does KD win with Middleton and Holiday if Giannis gets Kyrie and Harden? Your premise doesn't actually prove anything because it's not like it creates a fair playing field to compare them -- it creates an unfair one for KD because KD has another MVP on his team and Kyrie Irving, who most people would rate higher than Jrue or Middleton."
"Regardless of if he was or wasn’t, your reasoning is ridiculous. That’s like asking “if kyrie Irving can take time off halfway into the season without consequences, why can’t the average NBA player?” “If Harden can force his way out of Houston, why doesn’t every single NBA player in a unfavourable contract do that?” It’s called special treatment for the most famous people in the league, and it’s been around forever. So disagree with him, but don’t use that dollar store logic to get your point across"

"Obviously Kyrie is more proven and has the better career. That’s not debatable. I was just referring to them as players right now.  I also never said Zach is the clear-cut best 2-guard, I just said he has a case for it. This season will be his chance to prove it IMO. Right now, I think the conversation is between Booker, Mitchell, Irving, and LaVine. In terms of talent and production, they’re all right there. I think any of the four has a case for best SG. I just like LaVine, so I’m picking him lol."
"Welll, it depends right. Because if Golden State and the Nets get in the playoffs. Suddenly you're missing Andrew Wiggins for potentially 3 games out of a series or Kyrie Irving for 3 games out of the series.  In the East, that might not matter too much depending on how it shakes out, but in the West, they're going to need Andrew Wiggins present to have a shot.  The Nets if they make the Finals however are going to be absolutely hurting if they're down an all-star talent for 3 games out of the series."
“Kyrie Irving = French Fries”- 🤓
Do the Cavs win without 2011 1st pick Kyrie Irving? Guaranteed they don't win if LeBron doesn't return but I don't see them winning without the draft either.
**KYRIE IRVING**
Kyrie Irving is going to become Amish to avoid vaccination. He will show up to games in horse and buggy and start speaking Pennsylvania Dutch.
No way in hell is Jamie Foxx better than Kyrie Irving.
Last-minute expansion franchise - the Jacksonville Virus  Starting backcourt: Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins.  Who rounds out the roster?
I got downvoted one that thread by saying the sparks aren’t gonna fucking kick out Kyrie Irving for not being vaxxed lmao kids really think rules apply to everyone
"His efficiency was absurd when healthy, but it's always been absurd. 62 TS% is completely in line with what it's been since the 2016-17 season. And he definitely wasn't the sole engine of the Nets team - that's honestly really underselling Kyrie Irving. Kyrie averaged 20 shots a game with a 27/6/5 line across the season with only a minority of his shots being assisted, and even had a higher USG% than Harden. When it was just Harden on the floor, obviously he took over. But the point is that for some years there's a quiet argument along the lines of 'Harden is shooting 36% from 3 (for example), despite firing 18 a game and having everyone on defense coming at him.' - this year he took less of those shots, but there wasn't really any improvement in efficiency and it didn't feel like his game elevated from a reduced burden.  Basically, put it this way; if Steph Curry shot 42% from 3 but only took 4-5 attempts a game, no-one would be calling him the greatest shooter of all time. High usage players have a hypothetical argument in their favour that usually goes like; if they weren't forced to create something out of nothing as much, imagine how great they'd be? If they had a better team around them, imagine how great they'd be? And I think for some people they might feel they saw that hypothetical version of Harden and it was still ""just"" him."
"If you were in KD's position in round 2 and were missing two max contract teammates, do you think you woulda lost to him in 4 games or in 5?  How embarassed were you that you got taken to 7 by a team missing $100m worth of players?  Finally, how shitty is it to know that the best play of your career was injuring Kyrie Irving?"
"Harden at #10 is gonna get the most attention and rightfully so, but to suggest there are nineteen players better than Kyrie Irving, who became just the fourth player ever to average 27+ PPG on 50/40/90 shooting splits last season, is ridiculous in its own right."
"[Yes.

the disrespect to kyrie irving never ends with the pawns.
Did he not have james harden? But i Digress. This year everyones takes have been this Kevin Durant&gt;Lebron James James Harden&gt;Anthony Davis Kyrie Irving&gt;Russell Westbrook So my take is this if lebron wins with the “Inferior team” alongside the guy Kevin Durant couldn’t win with and Kevin Durant has a guy who Lebron did win with. I dont ever wanna hear Kevin&gt;Lebron. If Kevin wins this year I think the past year and this year Kevin&gt;Lebron
1. He had a back injury that was affecting him.   2. Both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injured.   3. The Cavaliers intentionally slowed down the pace of the game so as to not play to Golden State's strengths. Half court efficiency for most players is far worse than transition (which is a lot of what brings up offensive rating).
"Who would be more liked on the Celtics? Isiah Thomas or Irving, Kyrie?"
"Let me ask you this Stephen A.  Why would the Nets trade Kyrie Irving? a.k.a Mr. Box Office, for Ben Simmons? Think about what you’re saying here, that is blaasphemous!"
"I get that Jrue is probably a better player than Cavs Kevin Love but it's weird to me that Khris Middleton is being portrayed here as an equal to Kyrie Irving.  Even aside from that strange comparison, I have never really seen anyone call Khris a top 20 player.  If that's what he is, then great. He's one of my all time favorites. And I hope he can ride that and his playoff success to the Hall of Fame, like Kyrie was so obviously capable of doing by the time he won that championship."
I mean KD was the best player in both series’.  Like are those rings crossed off for Klay and Steph too?  Do they actually only have 1 ring?  Does that 1 ring have less value than the two they won with KD if the Cav’s were missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love basically all series?
"Jrue honestly fucks the comparison all up by having an amazing regular season then struggling on that end in the playoffs. If we're talking regular season 2020-21 Jrue, he's better than most (not all) of Lowry's all-star years. *Especially* the back half of the season once he recovered from Covid and figured out the system. There were three starting point guards last season who had a .500+ FG% and 15 ppg; LeBron, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday. Remove the 15ppg requirement and the list is the same but Ben Simmons is there."
"Danny Ainge built a team with Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams.  At some point the GM can only do so much. Danny Ainge did everything in his power to start a dynasty, it just didn't work out for non-front office reasons."
"&gt; **before the Hawks meltdown** this would be a tough call.  I recognize that Simmons has slipped and would not get you Kyrie now, but Irving has some major worts too."
&amp;#x200B;  2016: Kevin Durant or Derozan/Lowry (surprised no one mentioned it)  2017: Kyrie Irving  2018: Jimmy Butler  2019: James Harden  2020: Paul George  2021: Ben Simmons
Healthy Kyrie Irving. The greatest isolation guard of the modern NBA and can play high level on ball defense when locked in.

Yeah lmao I’m sure the LA sparks were totally gonna have security remove Kyrie Irving cus he didn’t have a vax card. Clearly it proves he’s vaccinated guys 🤡🤡
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
"I don't know if there is a way to ""fix"" it at all, especially if the player we are talking about is of a James Harden or Kyrie Irving stature (we all saw what happened when they wanted out). I think if anything the Schroder situation showed that only superstar-caliber players can successfully demand to leave their situation and come out better off after the fact. I'm also not so sure the NBA wants to ""fix"" these sort of situations because most of the time they are better for the league and create interesting story lines - the James Harden saga that ended with him becoming part of a super team in the Eastern Conference (something the NBA has been starving for since Lebron left Miami, especially as Golden State got so dominant and Lebron teamed up with AD in La etc.) and now Ben Simmons making headlines practically every week as that story continues to develop. A lof of fans hate the way guys are demanding to leave their situations and I understand it but like it or not, I think the NBA thoroughly enjoyed the way James Harden forced his way out and teamed up with Kyrie and KD - situations like that are very profitable and create an insane amount of buzz around their league."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"

Kyrie Irving for Paul George was among the few rumoured trades I remember
"Marcus Smart as borderline all star in the same category as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Vucevic, Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, and Bradley Beal?  I’m sorry but yeah fucking right, okay buddy lmao  This is why you don’t just rely on analytics alone"
"Nope that's the main reason it couldn't go through. Kyrie said he would sign a contract extension with SA, and SA reportedly was all in on an Irving trade, but they had no assets. They weren't going to part with Kawhi and the only other young players were Slowmo, Murray, Forbes, and White. Aldridge could've been had but then you're stuck with that contract if LeBron left."

"True, but if stint 1 lebron had a “entering his prime”Kyrie Irving, a much better coach in Tye, and a still very good K Love, I think we would be saying the same about his first stint."
"Top-X player. Hate it. You see all the time ""This guy is a Top-10 player in the league,"" like do you know how good the Top of the league is?? It's not disrespectful to say a guy like Kyrie Irving isn't a Top-10 player, it's just a reality. Top-10/20/whatever player has just come to mean ""this is a good player""."
[Charania] The Orlando Magic have traded Terrence Ross to the Brooklyn Nets for Joe Harris. Kyrie Irving is looking forward to having Ross on the team.

We can tick this one off the 'off-season checklist'  Kyrie Irving tweeting nonsense: ✅  John Stockton assists record analysis: ✅   MJ one hand pump fake compilation: ❌  Bill Russell jumping over an opponent: ❌
"AD wanted to play, the Pelicans benched him to avoid injury risk. Harden talked a lot of shit but came back to the team, still putting up all-star numbers. The one who was missing games for absolutely no reason most recently, and actually got deducted salary was Kyrie Irving."
"Oh totally, even the article says ""Players that don’t follow the rules may face fines or suspension, according to CNBC.""  That being said, there is probably  a limit to how much of shit like this:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/brooklyn-nets-star-kyrie-irving-fined-for-violating-nba-covid-19-rules.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/brooklyn-nets-star-kyrie-irving-fined-for-violating-nba-covid-19-rules.html)  The Nets and the league are going to be willing to put up with."
Kyrie Irving
Anything Kyrie Irving says
"Kyrie ""Edgelord"" Irving"
That's flat Earther and part time basketball player Kyrie Irving. Stop posting the dumb shit he say's.
"It's Kyrie Irving, what do you expect. He's the Kanye of the NBA, talent,  fame, bat shit insane."
"“My mask is off. Now take yours off. No fear.” - Kyrie Irving, during one of the worst pandemics in human history, after millions have died."
Kyrie Irving is a fucking idiot.
"When you have one talent that by pure chance happens to be worth tens of millions of dollars and you then surround yourself with enablers and mistake your good luck for understanding how the world works. Ladies and gentlemen, Kyrie Irving."
"Kyrie Irving is pretty fucking dumb. But the man balls, so he gets paid and is given a platform for his stupidity."
Why tweet that tho? Attention? You’re Kyrie Irving.
Kyrie Irving is an idiot.
“My mask is off. Now take yours off. No fear.“ - Kyrie Irving
Then people are failing as parents. But yeah let's blame a basketball player and let him influence your kids' scientific knowledge. You're right the celebrity worship in American culture is the real problem here. I like watching Kyrie Irving play basketball a lot. I am intrigued by some of his takes when it comes to spirituality etc and then laugh when he says something like the flat earth thing and move on with my life
Lebron James and Kyrie Irving
"In many cases, there's nothing wrong with being dumb.  There's also nothing wrong with calling someone who is actually dumb - dumb.  Adding onto your original question, there actually are a lot of things that's wrong with being dumb when you're someone with as much money and influence as Kyrie Irving."
"In many cases, there's nothing wrong with being dumb.  There's also nothing wrong with calling someone who is actually dumb - dumb.  But also, there actually is a lot of things that could be wrong with being dumb when you're someone with as much money and influence as Kyrie Irving."
“My mask is off. Now take yours off. No fear.” - Kyrie Irving
I guess.. I also definitely believe this story. We’re talking about kyrie Irving.
"this is about kyrie irving, not the type of people you're trying to make it about. people are using ""those type of people"" and attaching that to everyone that says something they don't like regardless of if it applies or not. that's what i mean"
"Kyrie ""the earth is flat"" Irving.   I'd be so embarrassed if I belonged to his group of people."
Let’s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Kyrie Irving doesn’t know what he’s doing
Celtics fans 🤝 Kyrie Irving   …..Hating Nick Wright…..
"\[Kyrie Irving\] There's a pandemic happening right now of untrustworthy media people, it's like a virus spreading among us."
"Kyrie ""The Yellow King"" Irving"
"They lie to us. ""Do you believe the Earth is round?""  **""This is not a conspiracy,""  ""The Earth is flat.""**  All these things that particular groups, and I won't pinpoint one group, they almost offer up this education. The fact that in our lifetimes that there are so many holes and so many pockets in our history... **Is the Earth flat or round? You need to do research on it... they lie to us.""**  There is no concrete information except for the information that they’re giving us. They’re particularly putting you in the direction of what to believe and what not to believe. **The truth is right there, you just got to go searching for it.”**   Famous researcher , Kyrie Irving"
"That makes no sense. In that case the tweet is ""Nets have gotten multiple trade offers for Kyrie Irving"" why would the next logical conclusion be ""and they haven't taken them cause Kyrie would retire"" and not ""the Nets don't want to trade him""?"
"You can’t even type coherent English on Reddit without making multiples typos in 1 sentence, and you’re calling Kyrie Irving an “illiterate prima donna” 🤡  Kyrie’s vague tweet could be comprehended a lot easier than your dumbass ranting about him which makes it even more ironic.   &gt;my typos don’t negate the fact that you were trying to criticize people for giving attention to a tweet….which is exactly what it is for…and exactly what his attention was.  Your stupidity knows no bounds. If you’re tired of people seeking attention on Twitter, why take a tweet from Kyrie and give it more attention? If you’re tired of attention whores you ignore them, you don’t feed them by giving them the attention they crave."
"I didn’t give into shit l, I am making fun of him.  And I don’t care about typos on social media, especially when Ian replying to 5 morons at once….like you.  Get over it.  Kyrie Irving is an illiterate prima donna and my typos don’t negate the fact that you were trying to criticize people for giving attention to a tweet….which is exactly what it is for…and exactly what his attention was.  Get out of here clown."
"I don't need to know him. There's more than enough evidence we've seen over the last decade to suggest that he clearly thinks he's smart, yet he spews pseudo-intellectual word salad in interviews and struggles to express coherent ideas much of the time.  I think it's pretty clear that Kyrie Irving isn't as smart as he thinks he is."
"*Write a couple sentences about what you like about* r/nba *and what is something you would change?*      I love how r/nba has a diversity of content, when I'm bored of ben simmons or kyrie irving rumors I can read in-depth analysis on [The Impact of Strip Clubs on James Harden](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/) or [The Charlotte Hornets have a transgender mascot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/joovqq/the_charlotte_hornets_have_a_transgender_mascot/)     *Where would you currently rank the your team (must have flair) in a Powerrankings today?*      I would rank the Kings **17th**. Even though they don't have any superstars(or a competent coach), they are still sitting on a 2-2 record in the west with wins over the Suns and the Trailblazers . However, I also wouldn't put them in the top half of the rankings since they haven't made any significant additions besides Davion Mitchell this offseason and they finished a distant **23rd** last season(**12th** in the west)  *How often do you come on* r/nba*?*   I browse r/nba multiple times a day, from bathroom visits to bedtime reading I'm also on it for most of the day.      *How many games of your team do you watch on average per week during the season? How many other NBA games?*      Usually 2-3 Kings games per week since I own richaun holmes + harrison barnes in fantasy. For other NBA games, I mostly stream them for short periods of time just to check in and see how certain teams are doing.       *If you weren't selected who would you select as a representative?*   No idea, do Kings fans exist?"
So just because only three guys have won championships as a top pick means that it’s pointless to get a top pick? So Indy shouldn’t even try to get a Dwight Howard or a James Harden or a Kevin Durant because they didn’t win a chip with their original team? You didn’t even mention Kyrie Irving btw or how a ton of those top picks have brought their teams to the conference finals or finals… It’s better to be a first round exit every year and take a gamble? You’re mentioning Giannis and Kawhi but it’s just a fact that it’s a lot easier to get star talent in the top ten every year than in the 15-20 range.
Kyrie Irving leadership style.
Kyrie Irving just give hi. too many excuses
Russell Westbrook and Kyrie Irving.
"He might end up being the third point guard Rookie of the Year from Melbourne in the last ten years, following Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons.  Insane strike rate for a foreign city. Or any city, really."
"Turns out dropping out from highschool and then perusing a career where CTE was first discovered as “punch drunk syndrome” (btw don’t believe Dr Bennette Omali and that movie, he didn’t even discover CTE or coin the term) isn’t conducive to create an intelligent, rational, well-adjusted, and smart adult. Who knew.  Really don’t like agreeing with republicans but honestly, athletes should just stay out of politics. Blows my mind that if a professor of political science from Harvard and Kyrie Irving released a statement about the current political landscape, Kyries would get 100* more attention and weight. We shouldn’t be looking to athletes for this type of stuff, full stop."
I am one of them. I know he shrinks in the playoffs.  Can we please trade WB for Ben Simmons or Kyrie Irving already (Staples center doesn’t require vaccination)???  Simmons would be happy as fuck in LA. His new mansion and his hoes are out here. He won’t be relied on to score
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a yurt in the woods with Kyrie Irving. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops sage, shirtless, incense steaming off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Kyrie. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's third eye, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the yurt. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"For ridiculous: Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Kendrick Perkins, Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan."
"Irving was the better scorer by far. Lebron got stats because that's what he does, doesn't always equate to wins or the most efficient offense possible. Everything has to go through his arch angel system so he will always get the stats. Draymond was the real MVP, series was wrapped if he wasn't suspended. Kyrie also clearly outplayed Bron, he was a more efficent offensive weapon and took over in crunch time."
"Ethan Strauss, Rachel Nichols, Maria Taylor and Kyrie Irving"
"Clippers traded an unprotected first and Baron Davis to the Cavs for Mo Williams.   Davis was washed, but the unprotected first became the #1 overall pick for the Cavs (Kyrie Irving)."
"Nah. Lebron has hardly even best the best player in a finals series.   2007 - Tony Parker  2011 - Dirk/Wade  2012 - Durant  2013 - I guess but he also choked.  2014 - Kawhi  2015 - Steph  2016 - Draymond/Irving  2017 - Durant  2018 - Durant  2020 - Anthony Davis  He'd a zero time champion if he wasn't bailed out by Kyrie and Allen, Draymond suspended, and carried by AD.  How many of these games did you actually watch?"
"Everyone knows the Kyrie Irving/ Isaiah Thomas swap was bad in hindsight, but it’s been understated that the Cleveland Cavaliers saw IT’s medicals, knew they were **much worse** than anticipated, and didn’t cancel the trade or receive meaningful additional compensation (only a future 2nd Round Pick in the 50s).  They pretty much knowingly did Boston (who still had a treasure trove of FRPs) a solid by choosing not to squeeze them or nix the trade."
Clippers traded Baron Davis and an unprotected first to the Cavs for Jamario Moon and Mo Williams.  That unprotected first round pick? Kyrie Irving.
Tacko Fall and Kyrie Irving have the same amount of points
"Whether you agree with Kanter's stances or not, this is actually standing up for some real shit. Being an actual rebel with a cause that can have some serious ramifications.  I hate to mention dude, and I probably shouldn't even do so, but it just makes me look at Kyrie Irving and what he's been ""standing up for"" recently as even more corny."
Obsessing over Kyrie Irving getting vaccinated is creepy and lame lol
I am not sure kyrie wants to play basketball.  i think he would rather be the the next joe rogan.  Were the Egyptian AND Mayan Pyramids actually both built by the Ashanti?- Next on I am 14 and this deep with Kyrie Irving and a potted plant.--sponsored by  Draftkings and  Mypillow.
"“The NBA would like you to know the facts about the COVID 19 Vaccine, unlike Kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons”"
"Thank you for saying this. That’s the part where people forget… Leftism isn’t some simple catch-all. There is quite a bit of contention between socialist/marxists and Maoists/Stalinists (How they combined after being at each other’s throat’s is a topic for another time).  That being said, it’s hilarious to see any sort of anti-Chinese rhetoric coming from the west or specifically the US. Here in the US, we are literally guilty for the same exact atrocities supposedly being committed by the Chinese although over here it’s a known fact. Yeah I don’t see any NBA player speaking out or going out of their way because the reality is that these guys are just regular dudes with barely any education and amazing genetics.  Like imagine LeBron somehow being able to get involved politically even though he’s only a high school graduate Who trains several hours every single day? The same with Kyrie Irving or any of these other supposedly woke athletes. There is not enough time in the day.  And before anyone brings up Kareem Adul-Jabbar…think about what you’re about to say… The dude was going to UCLA for four years and was an excellent student during high school. He was involved with the civil rights movement with Muhammad Ali/Malcolm X/MLK/preBlack Panthers. He probably would’ve been much more involved if it wasn’t for his career and how the FBI was actively executing members of the civil rights group  So no. There is no athlete alive speaking out in that manner"
"Kyrie Irving is truly not worth all the absolute bullshit you have to put up with to have him on a team. Talented, but porcelain mentally and physically."
"I mean can you imagine if he did lose his shit though... ""Director Hwang giggled while muttering Mickey Mouse ring under his breath, then responded sorry I don't have Ray Allen or Kyrie Irving to help save my endings!"""
Kyrie Irving is on the right side of history.
"Andrew Bogut would be in lockstep with Kyrie Irving on his COVID/vaccine stance if he was still in the NBA.  His whole twitter and IG is agreeing with conspiracy theories, calling Melbourne a fascist regime worst than Taliban Regime because of the extended lockdowns.  He thinks a bit too highly of his ability to be a ""critical thinker""."
"Kyrie Irving on his playing slump: ""I think I'm playing well. When I watch the film, I'm playing the game well. I'm just not taking the shot."""
Ben Simmons should be traded for Kyrie Irving.
"Kyrie Irving is just a taller Isaiah Thomas (another hot take: after a certain threshold, ball handling is overrated)"
"Winning rings is basically all luck. Valueing someone over someone else because they have more rings is idiotic. If Kyrie Irving misses that 3 in 2016 game 7 and the dubs win by like 1, LeBron’s legacy is so drastically different, and it would be because of his team."
People severely underestimate the power of cultural growth + time. if you traveled back in time and showed James Naismith a 10 second clip of Kyrie Irving dribbling a basketball his head would've fucking exploded
"&gt;Why do you kids always do this?  I'm probably older than you  &gt;No if you took a dude from 50 years ago who has never played modern basketball, doesn’t have the training or health of modern players and just threw him into the game today he wouldn’t do well.  That's the clarification I needed..the previous comment didn't point that out  &gt;If you took kyrie Irving and put him on a team 50-60 years ago would he be the best player?  Unfuckindoubtably!!!! Matter of fact the CIA/FBI/NASA or whoever the fuck is responsible for investigating paranormal stuff would kidnap him and conduct experiments on him. I see the ""they would get called for carrying"" trope get thrown out there a lot but I imagine that's by people who have never done a ball handling drill a day in their life. It's incredibly easy for a player of Kyrie's ball handling ability to make the adjustment and dribble with their finger tips (matter of fact this is what is emphasized in ball handling drills) Case in point - look at Dame handling the ball. But besides the ball handling the first time he would shoot a 3 pointer from 25 feet everyone would run out of the arena. You think Mikan's ass is guarding a pick n roll from 30 feet?  &gt;What’s actually being said is if you took bob Cousy as a child and trained him with modern training methods, modern health and nutrition and better gear along with an understanding of the modern game he would be a great player still.  Yeah sure...maybe. I don't have a problem with this line of reasoning. It's the (pick player from 1962) and they would drop 50 in today's game...you and I know there are people on this sub that believe that...matter of fact they will probably respond to this comment"
"Why do you kids always do this? No if you took a dude from 50 years ago who has never played modern basketball, doesn’t have the training or health of modern players and just threw him into the game today he wouldn’t do well. Why not flip it around this way. If you took kyrie Irving and put him on a team 50-60 years ago would he be the best player? The answer is probably not. He doesn’t have the health as it is to play modern ball so with worse medical advancement and gear he’d never stay healthy and 90% of his moves would be called a carry, a travel, or offensive foul. See how dumb of a double standard this is?     What’s actually being said is if you took bob Cousy as a child and trained him with modern training methods, modern health and nutrition and better gear along with an understanding of the modern game he would be a great player still."
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons come off as divas. And I hate using that term but it is true.   Both of them are in a very good spot to contend and win a chip yet they have the audacity to fuck thwir other teammates over. Like Ben grow up and WORK on your game bruh. Kyrie go over there and help your team. Or are you going to start playing as soon as someone gets injured for having to do more in your absence?  This also ruins team chemistry.
"I call him Kyrie ""Street Clothes"" Irving."
"&gt;I bet you were one of those people jumping the barricades screaming ""let Kyrie play.""  Oh I get it, you're slow. Why would a Knick fan be at Barclays demanding Kyrie Irving, a Net, play? wtf?"
Imagine having Kyrie Irving in charge of anything.  I can't even
Kyrie Irving has contaminated the chat
"If this is what you qualify as an eye test, then you might need to go to your local optometrist. Saying ""one guy hooper one guy no hooper"" isn't an eye test. Break it down. Cause last I checked, being a hooper doesn't make you a better player. If that were the case, the most hooper-ist of hoopers Kyrie Irving would be the easy best player in the league."
I'm not from the US&amp;A but wouldn't Kyrie Irving qualify as a superstar too?
"Well we don't know, just like we don't know the long term side effects of the vaccine. Either way, it's a personal choice and people should weigh the risks that come with either decision. Kyrie Irving is not a bad person."
Breaking News: The Nets decide to move back to New Jersey so an unvaccinated Kyrie Irving can play basketball.
"if the nba can remove Kyrie Irving from nba's Top 75 they came do the same for ADISNEY, Lefraud, and washed up Melo"
"So to recap, Kyrie Irving has convinced his friends to join his childhood favorite franchise, creating a super team that would be the prohibitive favorite to win the title, but now won’t play, not because he is against the vaccine, but because he’s against a mandate, so be can be the voice for the voiceless, who literally never shut up, by not talking about this publicly.  What the fuck did I just type? Am I having a stroke?  He’s gonna give up hundreds of millions of dollars for…what exactly? I’m being serious, is he okay? This is some shit you do before you get institutionalized."
Why do they think this is a good impression of Kyrie Irving? Does anyone find this remotely funny?
Kyrie Irving has United the BLM hoteps and the alt right goobers under one cause.No one man should have all that power. He has himself an army full of idiots
"Fire Kyrie Irving, now."
Imagine going from Steph curry to kyrie irving 🤢
A Kyrie?  An Irving?
...Fuck Kyrie Irving. This will (most likely) be his legacy.
I doubt these people give a shit about Kyrie Irving.
I root for them because of kyrie Irving
"Kevin Durant on Kyrie Irving: ""We support his decision"""
Kyrie Irving easily. No competition.
Would guess only 10% of the bozos are fans of Kyrie Irving or basketball in general.
Yall keep talking about the NBA.com site posting it.   Do you mean at this link?  https://www.nba.com/nets/video/2021/10/20/nba-75-kyrie-irving  That's still the Nets website.
"Right but it said ""Kyrie Irving has been picked as one of the NBA's top 75 players""  In the video Kyrie says he's happy to make the list. I'm not gonna say he was removed as some conspiracy but all signs point to him being on the list at one point"
Post the link  Do you mean this one?  https://www.nba.com/nets/video/2021/10/20/nba-75-kyrie-irving  That's still the Nets site.
"It does, but then it begs the question why the Nets uploaded the video with this description:  &gt;Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving has been named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team of the top 75 players in the league's history.  There's no other way to interpret that other than he was named to the team, unless they put it on there not knowing the results just as a placeholder."
The description to the video is literally “Kyrie Irving was selected to the … list.” And released. I don’t think the official Nets website just happened to make this and publish this on accident
"I disagree. Barring NBA players is super high profile, and the risk is relatively small. Again, it's like 5 total people a few times a year. The risk (however small) of invalidating the vaccine mandate entirely is not worth the barely noticeable health benefits of banning kyrie Irving and co. Plus, it's looking like any remaining unvaccinated players won't be playing anyway so it's good to let sleeping dogs lie.   It can be a pragmatic decision, not everything is a conspiracy. Sf did the best health related thing, and sidestepped a decision with economic impacts that wouldn't move the health needle anyway"

"That sorta makes sense. Makes all the doom and gloom about the Nets (as ridiculous as that is to say three games in) seem even more ludicrous. In the playoffs they'll have their optimal rotation and be much more cohesive, even if Kyrie Irving doesn't actually return."

"Kyrie Irving is the most damaging NBA player in the league at this point.  I wish he'd just retire. He's an idiotic, egotistical piece of shit."
"Ah yes. Kyrie Irving, one of the most philanthropic players in the nba, who constantly advocates for the empowerment of black people...   Is a big fan of the police."
"&gt; Hank Newsome, a Black Rights activist, who has called vaccination ""racist"", is at the protest in support of Kyrie Irving with a group of black pro-Kyrie supporters.

"Kyrie Irving is a fringe Top 10 guard in the league currently. Why on Earth would he be Top 75?  Guards who are definitively better: Steph, Dame, Harden, Luka, PG.  Then you guys guys like LaVine, Mitchell, Book, etc."

"&gt; the next mayor has confirmed that he’ll do what he can to work it out so that unvaccinated athletes for NYC teams can play.  That is your interpretation of what Adams said. To me he's just saying vague politician nothings, and I doubt he's interested in creating a shitstorm by making an exception for Kyrie. At the end he specifically says he'll just do whatever the Dept of Health says to do.  [Sauce:](https://nypost.com/2021/10/16/eric-adams-hopeful-kyrie-irving-will-play-soon-for-nets/)  &gt; “I think this is going to work itself out,” said frontrunner Adams, who is currently the Brooklyn borough president. He continued: “I believe we’re going to find a way to have safety and to continue to keep our standards strong.” &gt; “I believe the NBA and Kyrie, they should work out how they are going to address that, and I think it’s going to be up to them … and the city to come down with a real agreement, and at this time I think the NBA and Kyrie would be able to come to an agreement,” Adams added at an unrelated get-out-the-vote event in Queens. &gt; Adams declined to address whether he would take specific action on the matter, but added that if elected, “I’m going to sit down with the Department of Health and I’m going to follow them in every area of dealing with COVID, every area of dealing with health issues. “I’m going to follow their directions. If their directions call for something, that is what I’m going to follow,” he said.  Also, not specific to basketball, but during the debate this week he was very forceful in his support of vaccine mandates."
Could you imagine if the Kyrie Irving tail would wag the NYC dog?

Ehh...he's putting up similar numbers to Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving
"Candace Parker was packing her bags Wednesday afternoon, prepping for an early evening flight out of Chicago to her home in Los Angeles. She was wrapping up a memorable, whirlwind few days. On Sunday Parker, who grew up in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Ill., led the Chicago Sky to the franchise’s first-ever WNBA championship; the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury 80-74, to win the WNBA Finals 3-1. Parker, 35, had spent her entire 13-year WNBA career with the Los Angeles Sparks before signing with her hometown team in February, with the goal of bringing a title to Chicago. She delivered—and then got to unwind a little. Parker pulled up to the drive-thru at Portillo’s, a favorite Chicago-based hot dog joint, for a jumbo chili cheese dog and fish sandwich on Sunday night. The team was feted at a championship parade and pep rally on Tuesday; Barack Obama called to congratulate Parker and her teammates afterward. Now, real-life beckoned. Following the parade, Parker dropped off her daughter Lailaa, who just started seventh grade, at the airport Tuesday. Though she signed with Chicago, Parker kept her home in Los Angeles, and Lailaa still goes to school there. “She looked at me and like, you have one day to get back,” Parker says. Thus, she was furiously packing on Wednesday, to be back in time to take Lailaa to class on Thursday morning. “So that’s the life of a mom that just won a WNBA championship,” Parker says. Parker’s used to the busy motherhood balancing act: Lailaa was born in 2009, after Parker’s rookie season in Los Angeles, when she won both the WNBA Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards, to go along with an Olympic gold medal that summer in Beijing. Parker, a two-time high school national player of the year who became the first female to win the dunk contest at the McDonald’s All-American Game, is a six-time WNBA All-Star, and two-time WNBA MVP; she clinched her second WNBA title, to go along with her two Olympic golds (not to mention the back-to-back NCAA titles she won in 2007 and 2008 at the University of Tennessee). Her full-circle, heart-warming title for the Windy City comes at an opportune time for the WNBA, which enjoyed a banner 25th season and is growing in popularity, thanks to players like Parker. As an analyst for the NBA’s widely watched programs—she’ll be back at work, fresh off the title, early next week, as the 2021-2022 NBA season tipped off on Tuesday night—Parker’s work is now familiar to a wider swath of sports fans. Due to her on-court excellence and her conversational, analytic on-air presence, Parker’s emerged as one of the most influential figures in her sport. Read more: Candace Parker on Voting Rights In an interview during a brief packing break on Wednesday, Parker put on her analyst cap to break down what this second WNBA title means for her career. “You can mess around and do stuff one time, and people can doubt it,” Parker says. “But if you do something twice, it’s not by accident. So I’ve said, from the time I was at Tennessee, in order for my name to be mentioned with the greatest players at Tennessee, I have to win twice. So I do think this was a legacy-defining moment.” One that was so much sweeter—and memorable—since she won in Chicago. “I just remember watching ‘Bron [LeBron James] when he won in Cleveland,” says Parker. James, who’s from Akron, Ohio, returned to the Cavaliers from Miami in 2014 and led his team a title two years later, ending Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought. “Just the emotion and how it hit him. And I don’t think it was until yesterday when I realized, ‘man, I went home and we won.’ I don’t know if I fully grasped what all of this means.” The Sky finished just 16-16 in the regular season and entered the playoffs as a sixth seed; Parker had injured her ankle earlier in the season and missed eight games; Chicago finished 1-7 during that stretch. “I went out to LA and really thought I got Hollywood,” Parker says. “And couldn’t, you know, be gritty and play defense and rebound and all those things we did this year. It was so hard. That’s why I love it so much.” WNBA boom Parker’s buzzy Finals win followed some key victories for the WNBA this season. Google signed on as a sponsor. The league inked a multi-year deal with Amazon Prime Video to become the first women’s pro sports league streamed on the service. On WNBAStore.com, the league’s regular-season merchandise sales jumped 50% over the prior year, a record growth. The Sky has sold more merchandise on Fanatics than any prior WNBA champion, according to the Sports Business Journal. Regular season viewership was up 51% over last year; it was the league’s most-viewed season for national TV partners in 13 years. The Finals series between the Sky and Mercury drew an average of 548,000 viewers, up 23% from a year ago; these were the most-viewed WNBA playoffs since 2014. June 2009 -10 Questions for Candace Parker 0 seconds of 4 minutes, 49 secondsVolume 0% Changing societal attitudes are driving this growth, says Parker. “We’re filled with a league that people before were scared of,” says Parker. “Like, women should be in this place. I don’t fit that. I’ve never fit that. I don’t want to fit that. I don’t want my daughter to think she has to fit that.” As people grow more attuned to the benefits of diversity, the WNBA will remain well-positioned to expand. “Companies, and actually consumers, are demanding that they are represented by women,” says Parker. “We are a league that is the majority of the minority in this world. I say that in the sense of race, sexuality, gender, all of that. So we’re what all companies want and need.” Tokyo Olympics: Sue Bird 0 seconds of 2 minutes, 56 secondsVolume 0% Back to work Parker will now turn her attention to the NBA; in March, a TNT clip of Parker explaining to Shaquille O’Neal the nuances of playing defense in the modern NBA—where nearly every player on the court, no matter his size, can make a long-range shot—went viral. “Candace Parker Schools Shaquille O’Neal” read one typical headline. Such banter with Shaq, says Parker, happens all the time. “That’s how it is back in the green room,” Parker says. “When we’re watching television, me and D-Wade [Dwyane Wade] are trying to explain to Shaq something. We’re arguing with his viewpoint. ‘Well, when I used to do this.’ Like, Shaq, you were seven feet. Literally, all you had to do was throw the ball down to you and you score. Other people aren’t like that. It’s hilarious and I love him.” She’s been tracking the two biggest storylines entering the 2021-2022 season: the refusal of Brooklyn Nets superstar Kyrie Irving to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, and Ben Simmons’ standoff with the Philadelphia 76ers. Under New York City law, Irving can’t play in Brooklyn’s home games unless he receives the vaccine: the Nets have essentially benched Irving until he complies. “I do believe we are honestly at a point now where, as Chuck [Charles Barkley] said, you do get vaccines for others,” says Parker, who is vaccinated. “I don’t fault the Brooklyn Nets at all. We want you here, but you can’t be here partially. It’s all or nothing when you’re trying to win a championship.” Read more: Nike Stays Silent On Kyrie Irving’s Anti-Vaccine Stance Parker’s more sympathetic toward Simmons. After Philadelphia lost in the playoffs to Atlanta last year, Sixers teammate Joel Embiid called Simmons out for passing up a shot in Game 7 of that second-round series; Simmons’ coach, Doc Rivers, said, “I don’t know the answer to that” when asked, after Game 7, if Simmons could be a point guard on a championship team. “I’m big on keeping internal difficulties internal,” says Parker. “So to hear your coach say that, how do you recover from that?” Simmons held out of training camp and was kicked out of practice this week for refusing to engage; the three-time All-Star was suspended for Philadelphia’s season opener on Wednesday. “I was young once, and it’s very hard to tolerate and handle an organization that doesn’t have your back,” says Parker. “There are not many people in that situation that would handle it at 20-whatever years old professionally. I just think that it’s done. It’s a divorce that needs to happen.” She’ll start opining in the NBA TV studio on Monday. But what Parker really wants to do is lounge on a Mexican beach. “I love the balancing act,” Parker says of her multiple high-profile gigs. “It does get a little bit tiring, just because there’s so much emotion and energy that goes into winning a championship. You just have that crash. But I’ll get it together.” Mexico can wait. If a basketball is bouncing these days, Candace Parker will be there."
Kyrie Irving apparently doesn’t conform to boating culture either.
"If your discussion thread about a recovery performance like Aldridge’s isn’t locked and bombed with a graveyard of blank threads, especially with a damaged heart near Kyrie Irving/resident antivax nephews, you need to relegate to lurking and come back on a 10-day poster contract fr"

"Do Lakers have the same rules for vaccines as the Nets? I imagine they do..? If not then it’s weird to me how much sense a Westbrook for Irving swap makes lol. Like not just for the obvious meme factor. But if Irving can’t play for the Nets, that’s prolly the one team with enough shooting for Westbrook to work tbh. So I honestly think both teams would be better off than their current situation if this was possible. Biggest threat is prolly Kyrie threatening to retire if he just really hates LeBron for some reason  b4 anyone says “imagine westbrook harden and kd on the same team”"

"Yes we are and we should, you compare players relative to their contemporaries who played in the same rules and circumstances  Allen Iverson and Kyrie Irving wouldn't have the same handles if refs didn't ignore them carrying the ball, all these high flying dunkers would have a hard time jumping with the shitty shoes that past players played with, Kevin Durant's career would've been over after his Achilles tear...etc"
"&gt;and having Larry who is a smart defender but I struggle to see him adjusting to the pace of this NBA compared to the older pace where he could defend.  Good defense has more to do with effort than foot speed or athleticism. It helps to be fast and jump high, but Joe Ingles is a better defender than say Kyrie Irving. Kyle Anderson is a better defender than Tyler Herro. LeBron can take the faster player of the 3/4 position if it's a concern"

"&gt; Turnover rate is a function of how much you dominate the ball.  No its not. See kyrie irving and cp3.   &gt;And, are you suggesting KD is an elite passer?    im suggesting your point about curry being extremely turnover is bullshit."
Cleveland got the Kyrie Irving pick in an effort to aid the franchise's rebuild so that there would be a more marketable rival to the Heatles in the East.
"Nets are better than they seem, Harden is playing at his worst ever and Kyrie Irving is missing. We played well against them but at full strength they are a serious big 3 and plenty of good vets."
"Maybe so, but Hayward breaking his leg doesn't let off the fact that Ainge mismanaged other assets. For all of the extra first round picks he had, the only two hits he had were Tatum and Brown, two of the easier calls. At one point, Ainge had so many picks, he had to make sub-optimum drafting decisions. The only time he ever moved a pick was for Kyrie Irving."
"It’s one of the reasons. He has multiple reasons..Being unhappy, unfulfilled, he thought Kyrie Irving and Deandre Jordan could fill his holes, and they did, for a while. He thought he could earn more respects from his peer as the best player in the league unanimously and separated from LeBron and Giannis and Steph, and he did,  after the Bucks series… and now he got what he wants, the Hardest Road with another MVP on his team."
"No it's literally a shot, if you get stripped on a gather they call it a block now, if you are going up it counts as a shot  There are multiple examples of this and why some guards are averaging a good amount of blocks, Kyrie Irving was averaging like .7 blocks due to this and someone made a compilation he averaged more blocks than LeBron last season due to this"

This nets team being a 1 seed *is* the bare minimum. And we have 0 evidence to indicate that Kyrie is gonna get the jab and return them to superteam status this year. We’re calling them a mess because they are a mess. The most talented mess in the league, but a mess."

"Expectations plus the fact Kyrie is a selfish idiot. Sprinkle on the fact they are a major market and have major players, and it's a recipe for biased hatred (I am not a Nets fan, and as far as I'm concerned, they can get fucked until Irving is traded or released.)  But, yeah, they are fine. Even without Irving, there's no team in the East that can beat them in a series other than the Bucks. And even that is a tossup.   And you look out West. The Warriors are steamrolling people. The Suns are tearing it up, but I'd still favor a healthy KD/Harden Nets over PHX. You can never count out a healthy LeBron team, but if you forgot past seasons and only looked at this year, no one would take the Lakers as a serious threat. 20 games into the season, the Blazers are three games back from the #3 seed while also being 1-9 on the road.  The NBA season is just really fucking long. People just have to make up narratives to sell stories."
"Comments like these make me wonder if people watch basketball because the issues with the 2017-2018 Cavs are completely different from the 2021-2022 Lakers. The Cavs central problem, above all else that year, was that the guy they acquired to replace Kyrie Irving for their “big 3” sucked. The Lakers don’t have that problem since Bron, AD, and Russ have all proven this season that they are all still pretty great players. It’s role players who have to step up, and that’s much easier to accomplish especially with 60 games left in the regular season."
"If Kyrie Irving comes back, they stand zero chance. I’d slightly favour them against this current iteration of the Nets."
"Two things.  One; yes, he was still on the Cavs when he said the Earth was flat. Two; I did some quick Googling to confirm this, and in so doing, I found some of his quotes from when he was on the Road Tripping podcast, which is where he first revealed that he believed the Earth was flat.  One of them is quite funny - Richard Jefferson asks Kyrie why he keeping putting the word ""planets"" in quotes (as if he doesn't believe that other planets are real) and here is what Kyrie had to say as an explanation:  &gt; “Because, everything that they send—or that they want to say they’re sending—doesn’t come back,” Irving explained. “There is no concrete information except for the information that they’re giving us. They’re particularly putting you in the direction of what to believe and what not to believe. The truth is right there, you just got to go searching for it.”  I have absolutely no idea what he's saying, but it did make me chuckle nonetheless."
Kyrie Irving has remained injury free for 82 games of the season and therefore wins the iron man award
"&gt;he goes out of his way to hit Jokic  It was a 5v4 fastbreak.  &gt;makes sure to hit the bad knee.  Heat Nuggets was November 8th. Jokic hadn't been listed on the injury report since October 30th, when he was probable.   &gt;What about that play was necessary?

"It’s specific too.  “Hey Steve believe it or not, here is the secret to the 2016 cavs…. when you have Lebron James and Kyrie Irving you just run a lot of iso driving plays w/ options for kick out passes to 3pt shooters”  I doubt there’s anything Ty could tell Steve that he doesn’t already know unless it’s only useful in really unusual situations."
"He was traded for Kyrie Irving to the favorites in the East to play with the best player of all time. Everyone was getting huge bags after winning with LeBron, IT was next in line but got rushed back by the Cavs medical staff/FO. This whole “he got thrown into a trash can” revisionist history is so weirdly rampant around here, bizarre that people think of it that way."
"Dude got traded pretty much straight up to LeBron James in exchange for Kyrie Irving. There's some pretty crazy revisionist history going down: he hated to leave but he was cool with it because as much as he loved us, he wanted to get paid BIG, and he know Danny wasn't going to do that but (if the played remotely like he had been doing) some other GM would have."
"Kyrie Irving, Pistol Pete"
"Irving for Simmons.   Probably the best chance for both the Sixers and Nets to get rid of cancers for their team.  Objectively speaking though, it's probably Philly that turns that down. Simmons' issues apparently stem from mental health. Irving is just a stupid fuck.   Is there anything on Earth that could possibly display how stupid Kyrie is than the fact that Philly would turn down that trade?"
"Kyrie Irving, Scottie Pippen, Derrick Rose, Karl Malone, Allen Iverson  I’m not saying basketball players can’t be smart, or that basketball players are inherently dumb. I’m saying that because they’re very good at basketball doesn’t mean in the slightest they’re smart in real life too.   Why the fuck would knowing where the defensive rotation is coming from equate to real life intelligence?"

"&gt;	On Monday's episode of The Lowe Post, ESPN.com's Brian Windhorst disclosed the Pacers unsuccessfully attempted to nab Irving in advance of the NBA draft as buzz started to build that George was being shopped.  &gt;	""I know that around the draft and in the Paul George talks, the Cavs were not willing to make Kyrie Irving available for Paul George,"" Windhorst said.  &gt;	""The Pacers offered Paul George for Kyrie Irving,"" ESPN.com's Zach Lowe added. ""That's a thing that happened, according to people that we've talked to.""   &gt;	According to a report by Windhorst, Ramona Shelburne and Dave McMenamin, the Cavaliers, Pacers and Denver Nuggets discussed a trade that would have sent Love to Denver, George to Cleveland and assets including Gary Harris and the draft's 13th pick to Indiana..  &gt;	Cleveland, meanwhile, has been left to ponder a future without Irving. Windhorst broke the news that the four-time All-Star requested a trade July 7 as he seeks to break free from a partnership with James.  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2723814-paul-george-trade-for-kyrie-irving-reportedly-repeatedly-rejected-by-cavaliers.amp.html"
"Kevin Durant &amp; Kyrie Irving.   Durant NOT for joining the warriors but for trying to explain that it wasn’t a weak ass move. If he just went “yeah, I joined the best team. Fuck you” I would not have had a problem.   Kyrie is self explanatory"
"Well then I don’t know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren’t good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we’ve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they’re at risk of a shot clock violation."
"Yup, people act like modern players are just evolved humans or some shit lol   People aren’t just born faster and stronger in just a couple decades. They just have access to better training, health care, science and even gear. Let’s see how long a kyrie irving last when he’s playing in a pair of converse and isn’t allowed to do anything but dribble with his hand on top of the ball. Dude would get called for a travel 5 times to open the game and then blow his legs out"
"Guess that process takes a couple decades then? Maybe you'll contend for a ring by 2030, bud lmao. You keep insulting the pacers as an organization as if I don't already know the team is bad and the front office is dumb. At least I can recognize when the team I root for sucks, unlike you. Sad sight to see.   But hey, at least Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker both worked out for you lmfao  Try getting less angry about your team. It's bad for your health, pal"
Kyrie Irving.
"Being called favourites and that too with superteam  does that for you. Look at the lakers. They get flak for even breathing.   Idk what they expect from Nets, maybe something like ""Why don't they win all games?"". Also losing that game against Warriors, having one of the most hated star in a team, Kyrie Irving situation, it's like everything coming together."
"&gt;But I've seen Bird tear teams apart with his shooting prowess in was that LeBron never could.  So he’s a better scorer because he’s a better shooter? I didn’t know point from jumpshots mattered more than points at the rim. Somebody better tell shaq and Giannis they’re not high level scorers. What does it matter how someone tears a team apart? If a player could just dunk their way to 30ppg, what makes that less dominant or makes them an inferior scorer than someone who puts up 35ppg shooting jumpers?   &gt;As demonstrated by his legendary 40/50/90 season.  Also in the 50-40-90 club are Malcolm Brogdon and Kyrie Irving. Do you also think they’re better scorers than lebron?   &gt;I love them both, but LeBron's per-game average certainly doesn't mean he's a better scorer, it just means he got more shots and was healthy longer. I'm not sure what other case there could be made for LeBron being a better scorer than Bird.  Literally every high level scorer took a lot of shots. Do you think Jordan, kd, Kobe, etc just magically scored all their points without taking a bunch of shots? This is just 🤦🏿‍♂️"

"Short answer: no.  Long answer: PGs are targeted on defence for being liabilities in the PnR. Imagine a guy who's an entire foot shorter than Kyrie Irving (not saying he's a good nor bad defender) being targeted on every PnR. He'd be a terrible liability in today's game cause people are just gonna shoot over him every play they can. Practically an uncontested shot for the modern NBA bigs.   Only thing that's making another 5'3 player relevant is an offensive machine like Isaiah Thomas was years ago, except 6 inches shorter. And HE was a massive defensive liability too."
"Oh, please trade Westbrook for Irving! Imagine Lebron and Kyrie, on the same team! Or hear me out: Harden, Durant and Westbrook! This would effectively make time fold back upon itself crating a temporal loop which will free us from covid, Trump and the bubble Suns."
"This is an underrated comment, and not just because I’m a Kings fan.  People haven’t fully grasped what the playin has done to the trade deadline.  I blame the Magic for being entirely too sane last year.  You know who can make the playoffs at the deadline?  Everyone!  Except for the teams that decided to start up the tank at the beginning of the year, you know who’s going to try to make the playoffs at the deadline?  Almost everyone.  Will it be stupid?  Sure!  But because of the playin, now it is the way.  There might be one team that gets to the deadline, has been trying to make the playoffs, can still make the playoffs, and won’t try to.  But that’s not going to be true every year now.  There are not going to be multiple teams doing it.  And it’s definitely not going to be the team in the middle of a drought.  The players available at the 2021 deadline that can improve your team will be John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, and maybe a Spur."

Suns aren’t really a match for GSW especially when Klay comes back in a few weeks. They have way too many weapons. The only team that has a chance against GSW is the Nets but only if Kyrie Irving comes back.   But i am looking forward to seeing the GSW and the Suns going at it. I’m sure it will be a great game.

"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"
"They were both with us for 2 years.   Kemba wasn't a chemistry problem, he was mostly injured and also maybe not a great fit.   Kyrie ""I should have shot 30"" Irving wanted to run his own show. He didn't want to share the limelight with anyone, he caused a lot of the chemistry issues."
"Indigenous people have a lot of distrust of the government and specifically the Healthcare system.  This same system was forcefully sterilizing indigenous women without their consent, this same system stereotypes us as addicts, many native people have died after being refused service or outright ignored.  Thirty steps lead to indigenous vaxx rates. Maybe if the health care system actually cared for us, we would have more trust in it. Regardless of what Kyrie did I'll guarantee he wasn't the only unvaxxed on the rez.  Am double vaxxed but indigenous hesitancy was created by the hostility they are treated with by that system and that includes Kyrie Irving."
Kyrie Irving for Tyler Herro straight up. Who says no?

"If you want real Sports Analysis, you'll find it on Podcasts. All you're going to find on Television is narrative pushing drama because it's entertainment, and the media needs something to keep people's attention. It's not entertaining to watch a team with no drama be successful with the exception of their fans. The Lakers and Nets are the ones that are getting a majority of the coverage because, 1. The National Media had crowned them to become champions before the season started, and now they have a narrative they themselves created because both teams are currently underachieving. 2. They're the ones with the most drama with the Lakers trading all of their players from last season for Russel Westbrook, and the Nets are missing Kyrie Irving.   If you are a fan of any personal team, I would recommend to follow a podcast that specifically covers your team like SB Nation, Locked On, etc...There are other National Podcasts that I listen to that does a good job of covering the entire league such as the Ringer, Bill Simmons (despite his Boston bias), Adrian Wojnarowski, and more.   We all have to stop expecting Television to cover the topics that we want, because these sports analysts on ESPN, FOX, CBS, NBC, etc...only exist to spew out bad takes, and topics that have nothing to do with the game so we can go complain about it on social media. That's exactly what they get paid to do, and it's never going to change until we stop giving them coverage."
"I am a life long MSU/Magic/Lakers fan, but became a warriors fan when Draymond Green got drafted. I went on to be a Curry fan. I hate that Kevin Durant left the Warriors but also hate that he made it obvious that he was better than Curry, while they were teammates.  I have long hated James Harden for on-court reasons. Among my favorite recent NBA moments were the warriors beating the Rockets in the playoffs. I have long hated Kyrie Irving for off court reasons.  I like rooting for the Nets to implode even more than I liked rooting for the Rockets to implode."

"I’m a Celtics fan. I have always hated Ben Simmons for his social-media driven personality and obviously being a somewhat rival of ours (we always beat them so no rivalry), and I despise of Kyrie Irving for the empty promises that he made to our team and the flaky selfish attitude and honestly just the bad memories. LeBron struggling right now, lookin old…I’m not ready to tease Harden just yet…but… As far as basketball karma goes for me, I’m sitting back with my feet up this year listening to the wisdom of Jaylen Brown while eating popcorn just LAUGHING at my foes crumbling.   I should add that I am fully aware of the mediocre season we have had to start, and yes I am still scared of Brooklyn."
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
"Agreed. Obviously if you were building a solution in a lab, it’d be a 6’10 Kyrie Irving. But lebron at the peak of his powers would still be a problem for anyone."
I just really hate Kyrie Irving. I hope he never plays another game.
"There's a whole generation of guards that I hate just because at some point some pundit, or analyst, or rando on this site said was better than Dame.   Kyrie Irving, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, to name a few. Most of these dudes are good guys and very fun to watch, but a part of me loves seeing them have a bad game in the pettiest way, because I know that at some point someone said with a straight face that they were a better player than Damian Lillard. These days Dame usually gets the respect he deserves, but like pre-2019 everybody was trying to act their favorite player was actually better than Dame because of some stupid shit and I still hate those players, just a little bit, because of it."
"You clearly have never watched NBA players playing 1 on 1 nor have watched Kyrie Irving in 1 on 1.  What good does unlimited range have in a half court, 3-dribble setting 1on1? The defender is in your face from the beginning."
"As a kings fan, me too. The headache of Kyrie Irving would be substantially easier to deal with than the headache that our current team produces"
Kyrie IRving
"&gt;You are telling me that he can guard Kyrie Irving 1 on 1? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The guy who shot 50 40 90 last season, and its arguably one of the most skilled players in NBA? Cmon man.  He's not gonna clamp him lol, and Kyrie will probably score alot, but yes, Steph CAN hold his own with the defense he's shown.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;His defense stats are inflated because of excelent team defense GSW is dispaying this season. Same as 2016.     2016 Steph PPP against PnR Ballhandler: 0.75 (Worse than current Steph by a lot)  2016 Steph DFG%: 40%. Similar but worse.  These are individual tracking stats, not DRTG lol. You can't really inflate how well you deal with a PnR that much. And again, if you don't like stats, just watch games."

"&gt;So you think he can guard old Lebron James, and Kyrie Irving now? No. He can't man.  Lebron, no. Kyrie? Hell yes, he could do wayyyy better. His defense has been so good this season. Man, just watch the games, I'm telling you. He's letting up 0.50 PPP when defending the PnR ballhandler per [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) stats. His DFG% is 38.9%. Those are great stats. Just watch the games."
"So you think he can guard old Lebron James, and Kyrie Irving now? No. He can't man. I give Curry his flowers, he is great team defender, he can read ball lanes perfectly, and he talks on defense all the time. But to say he is good defender, as far as 1 on 1 and team defense go, I cant agree on first one, because simple logic is not going in Curry favor."
Kyrie Irving?  He’ll probably get snubbed for choosing not to play this season (if this continues) and for past and possible future similar actions some have already deemed selfish.
"Well maybe he shouldNT do pompous things like set up his own TV special for a decision, or tell Kyrie Irving (when they were playing together) something along the lines of ""Keep this up and you can be my wing man.""  Guy IS a DOUCHEBAG and has been his entire career. Sorry.  PS: and this is beside the fact that his career got a major boost when Stern left, who would have blocked his superteams ala CP3 to the Lakers Sterns last year."
"This isn’t true and this is a basketball subreddit that’s follows the NBA not a debate about race. The players that are considered the best in the league are the ones that really get talked about. And guess what?? 8/10 of them are black. People have been overhyping Tatum since 2017. Everyone talks about LeBron in here. Warriors fans love their guy Poole. The bulk of the discussion on here post Olympics was about Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving. I don’t think. Lastly, you’re a bit of a hypocrite because (and I get it you’re a mavs fan and they’re you’re two best players) all you lost about is Luka and KP. They are both white players and you’re in here making this thread about race?? Why not post more about Brunson or Hardaway?   This subreddit follows the *current* NBA landscape/news/events. Context is always a relevant piece as to when and why certain players are being discussed."

"No, that still probably goes to the 84 class, that's why I said those two are one of the best, and I did not say the best. If you look at who was drafted in those classes it's hard to argue that they're not one of the best drafts classes . Steph Curry, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Blake Griffin, kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Kawai Leonard, Jimmy Butler all came from either the 09 or 11 draft class."
"Slightly wrong.   Lebron left the following year.  In 2018, Kyrie Irving was traded in the offseason to the Celtics and IT was not the same.   The Cavs did a massive roster overhaul which allowed Lebron to push to the finals one last time with the Cavs."
"You forgot Kyrie Irving. Maybe Van Vleet.  Figured they'd consider D'Angelo Russell but seeing what Morey's asking for, D'Angelo's probably not on that list."
"No, this is mad shade at one of the best philosophers to ever do it.   Diogenes would tear Kyrie Irving to pieces and then spit in what's left of his face."

Stop twisting my words.  &gt;and picked up Caris Levert Rights via trade And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD  The reality is [this](https://www.sportscasting.com/why-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-decided-brooklyn-nets/) and I don't know why you'd wanna argue against it, but whatever. Kinda tired of this whole discussion tbh. If you guys wanna think Allen and Dinwiddie are the reason you got Kyrie, KD and Harden, so be it. I'm out."
"Yep, [very smart moves](https://www.sportscasting.com/why-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-decided-brooklyn-nets/).  My hate for big markets lmao. Imagine being this sensitive that you're actually trying to explain how your ""brand"", smart moves etc. are the reason you got a superteam. The reality is in that link."

"This is a ridiculous take. LeBron played with Wade/Bosh in Miami, Kyrie Irving in Cleveland, and Anthony Davis on the Lakers. KD went to the finals with Bestbrook and Harden, and then not again until playing with Curry and Klay.  You can't criticize Curry for only being able to win with other stars when the guys your saying have made teams contenders ""playing with anyone"" have not shown they can win a title or seriously compete when not playing with another superstar.   LeBron does deserve some credit for his finals runs in 2007 and 2018 with mediocre supporting casts, but those teams weren't actual contenders without major injury breaks. The only time they played legitimate title contenders in those playoffs the Cavs got swept by the Spurs and then swept by the Warriors."
"inb4 this thread gets locked from the same 2A, “Kyle’s innocent” crowd who backed Kyrie Irving and him “not giving into that socialist 5G liberal chip vaccine.”"
"Was a starter on the Nets, along with superstars Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.   That was about the only positive thing I can say about him for last year. He didn’t come close to earning those minutes and was consistently the dead weight on the team whenever he was on either side of the floor."
"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.	Stephen Curry	6.23   4.	Kevin Durant	6.03   5.	James Harden	5.95   6.	Magic Johnson\*	5.93   7.	Damian Lillard	5.48   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.35   9.	Chris Paul	5.18   10.	Larry Bird\*	5.12   11.	John Stockton\*	4.90   12.	Kyrie Irving	4.83   13.	Tracy McGrady\*	4.69   14.	Julius Erving\*	4.64   15.	Anthony Davis	4.64   16.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.62   17.	Kawhi Leonard	4.55   18.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokić	7.45   4.	Kevin Durant	6.44   5.	Stephen Curry	6.37   6.	Tracy McGrady\*	6.17   7.	Magic Johnson\*	6.08   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.42   9.	Larry Bird\*	5.40   10.	Kawhi Leonard	5.35   11.	Julius Erving\*	5.33   12.	James Harden	5.26   13.	Giannis Antetokounmpo	5.23   14.	Chris Paul	5.23   15.	Dirk Nowitzki	5.19   16.	Damian Lillard	5.14   17.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	5.04   18.	Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."

"- Both Kyrie Irving &amp; Ben Simmons will return to play before the All-Star break.   - The Grizzlies will go on a fire sale at the trade deadline.  - Either the Celtics or Knicks will miss the play-in tournament.  - Klay Thompson and James Wiseman will make the Warriors slightly worse in the short term but both will be starters by the start of the playoffs.  - Lakers will look fine after LeBron comes back, but will inevitably be upset in the 2nd Round."
Steph only won with Draymond and Klay Thompson due to Kevin love and Kyrie Irving being injured in the finals when they won.  They would’ve lost that year to a fully healthy cavs team like they did the next year. This is why they needed Durant. They never win another ring without him.
"Kyrie only has one father, Drederick Irving"
You've forgotten about Ben Simmons not playing and Kyrie Irving not getting the vaccine.
"Yeah, it's incredible the revisionist history around those LeBron Cavs team. Kevin Love will be a HoFer and Kyrie Irving outplayed Steph Curry in an NBA Finals, but people on this sub act like the roster that went into 2018 was the roster from 2015-2017.  The 2017 Cavs obliterated the Eastern Conference with Kyrie averaging 27/3/5 and Love averaging 17/10/1 to aid LeBron, in fact they were so dominant in the East that some analysists unironically believed that they could've pushed the Warriors in the Finals.  LeBron James is a great player, we dont need to lie about how good or bad his teams were to make him greater. The 2015-17 Cavs were absolutely stacked, they dismantled a 51-win Raptors and 53-win Celtics in 2017 like they were G-League squads.  They were stacked, the Warriors were just more stacked."
"Oh man yeah, he was a 3rd pick -- he didn't play a minute at Kentucky either.   That draft is so weird -- Kyrie Irving was super injured at Duke, went 1, Kanter didn't play, went 3. Then the rest is like Derrick Williams, Tristan Thompson, Jan Vesely, Bismack Biyombo.... and somehow, Kemba, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, Kawhi and Nikola Vucevic went behind these guys."
"The Harden thing actually made more sense than I anticipated, which is to say more than zero. Harden would have some leverage with the sign and trade situation, and I could see him wanting out of any big three that involves Kyrie ""MIA"" Irving."
"I can easily think of 30 players better than Simmons (I'll exclude Embiid from the list)  In no real order: 1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Curry 5. Luka 6. Jokic 7. Harden 8. PG 9. Cp3 10. Kawhi 11. AD 12. Lillard 13. Tatum 14. Zion 15. Butler 16. Beal 17. Trae Young 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. KAT 20. Zach Lavine 21. Booker 22. Bam 23. Jaylen Brown 24. Jrue Holiday 25. SGA 26. Ja Morant 27. Rudy Gobert 28. Middleton 29. DeRozan 30. LaMelo Ball  Also Kyrie Irving if he actually wanted to play basketball  There is probably some you could make arguments for one way or the other and obviously fit comes into play so I doubt they're trying to trade for say Rudy Gobert, but I also probably forgot some players you could add to this list as well.  That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"
"Ok so a lot to unwrap here.  Gathering indoors is the #1 cause of covid spread. Guess what cold weather forces people to do?   #2, the vax mandate being lifted in March is unlikely. Kyrie Irving being immediately reinstated is also unlikely. C’mon dude. Common sense."
"Assuming Irving is willing to play for the sixers and Simmons mental issue is resolved shortly after being traded.  Simmons for kyrie seema like the perfect solution to both teams predicament.    Who says no to this trade?  Morey gets his star to pair with embid.  Nets get a young, tall, elite defender, passer, versatile player to pair with kd and harden.  Both fanbases gets a new nutcase err I mean star to get to know.  Does both teams/fanbases wins, lose or draw with this trade."
"You clowning bro😂 notice how you said “probably” yeah do some research. Don’t come at me saying I’m trying to “concentrate on my agenda” when you’re the one uneducated and you have no idea what “my agenda” is. I commented on one thing (which by the way happened, it is factor information) and you think you know everything about me.  Days after MJ retired the NBA dropped the investigation saying Jordan had done nothing wrong. It was then his choice to carry out his retirement not even for 1 season but for 2. How is mj a good teammate for CHOOSING to not play in his prime but kyrie does the same and he is ridiculed?  Your whole basis is predicted on a conspiracy theory of “mj’s secret suspension”. Next time you try telling someone they’re “pushing an agenda” maybe you should learn the facts instead of saying what “could have happened” or that “you doubt he just retired for 2 years”.   So let’s add the factual “context” you think I’m missing:  Fact: Just days after MJ announced his retirement the league concluded their investigation saying he did nothing wrong. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2020/04/25/michael-jordan-retirement-gambling-conspiracy Fact: He was cleared of his gambling allegation and still CHOOSE to sit out for 2 seasons. Fact: MJ’s father died. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/article/james-jordan-death.amp.html  Fact: Jordan explained his 1993 retirement was due to his father’s murder. https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2891114-michael-jordan-explains-1993-retirement-was-due-to-fathers-murder-not-nba-ban.amp.html  Fact: Kyrie Irving CHOOSE to not get the vaccine; results: he couldn’t play. https://www.google.com/amp/s/theathletic.com/news/nets-say-kyrie-irving-wont-play-or-practice-until-he-can-be-full-participant/ZQmH5TVdCfd3/%3Famp%3D1  Fact: Scottie Pippen was the most under paid player in the entire league his years with the bulls. https://www.google.com/amp/s/in.nba.com/amp/news/the-last-dance-scottie-pippen-the-most-underpaid-superstar-in-the-nba-chicago-bulls/1pgk8tepz4ess1w0aczqwaqnlm  Fact: Scottie Pippen CHOOSE to prolong the surgery so he could enjoy his summer. https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2887502-scottie-pippen-on-delaying-surgery-in-1997-im-not-gonna-f-k-my-summer-up.amp.html  Fact: Michael Jordan called Scottie “selfish” for waiting on the surgery. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportscasting.com/michael-jordan-called-scottie-pippen-selfish-for-demanding-a-trade/%3Famp   You won’t reply to this, you’re a casual that’s uneducated. Mj choose to sit for 2 years in his prime. That is so much more selfish than Kyrie sitting out. If you wanna make the excuse for MJ about missing 1 season that’s fine (even though he still could have played) but a second season? That is straight up selfish.  This is a pattern as well. Jordan had so many selfish acts it’s not even funny. More include: Michael taking super max deals while his teammate (that he couldn’t win without) got paid nothing. Mj going out gambling the night before an elimination game where he then went 3/18 and Scottie carried. Many more I could lost if you’d like.  So how was mj not selfish but Kyrie is? There is absolutely 0 chance you’ll reply to this. You’re an uneducated hypocrite sucking off mj. 🤡🤡🤡"
Kyrie Irving
"Malika Andrews should thank god Kyrie Irving exists, don’t think she would have a job otherwise"
I misread the second part as Kyrie and was wondering why Kylie Jenner was trying to trademark Kyrie Irving
"At the time it looked like Kyrie wanted to be here though, he talked up his connection to Boston through his dad, and [told season ticket holders that he planned to re-sign with Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24896082/kyrie-irving-says-plans-re-signing-celtics).  From what I understand he changed his mind in part due to the death of his grandfather making him reevaluate his priorities, and the absolute shit show that was the 2019 season."
"Again, Tatum and brown are only 22 and 24. U should absolutely expect them to continue to get better, players rarely peak that young. And as we've seen good players are available all the time so they shouldn't jump the gun when they still have time. Like the bucks sold the farm for jrue holiday, that might make sense for a team on the verge of losing their star player who is really in the middle of his prime, but it doesn't make sense for the Celtics. Lastly, it's not true that they don't exercise their assets, they made a great trade for kyrie Irving with one Nets pick and essentially used the other two to draft Tatum and brown."
"""Trader Danny"" doesn't trade at all, actually. Is a very r/nba bad take. Antoine Walker trade, Pierce+KG trade, IT trade to get us into the playoffs, Kyrie irving trade, the trade down from #1 to 3 to get Tatum+assets"
"&gt; On the Lowe Post podcast, I mentioned the possibility of leaving Harden off the Eastern Conference roster after he loafed his way out of Houston. His play with the Brooklyn Nets has hammered home how silly that would have been.  &gt;He starts over Kyrie Irving. Harden is flat-out better. When Irving anointed Harden the point guard, he stated the obvious"
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."
Of course not. He’d just pass that shit to Kyrie Irving or Kevin Durant
"""Is this your best free throw shooter?"".  -Kyrie Irving"
"Kyrie said [he wants to retire in his early 30s possibly](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2807470-kyrie-irving-hopefully-planning-to-retire-in-early-to-mid-30s#:~:text=Boston%20Celtics%20point%20guard%20Kyrie,%22I%20love%20basketball%20itself.). He turns 29 in a couple weeks. I think he's gonna retire in about 3 years."
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
If things went the Celtics way with Kyrie Irving or Kemba or Gordon Hayward  sometimes you just get unlucky
The Kemba acquisition looks bad in hindsight. Obviously at the time he was viewed as a more team friendly Kyrie Irving. Injuries have really slowed him down.
"&gt;miss used so many of their   I think people are looking to clown DA...but it’s not like he let his war chest evaporate w nothing to show for it.  * BOS 2014 1st, tanking year: Marcus Smart  * BKN 2014 1st: James Young  * BKN 2016 1st: Jaylen Brown  * BKN 2017 1st: Jayson Tatum  * BKN 2018 1st: traded for Kyrie Irving  * SAC 2019 1st: Romeo Langford  * MEM 2020 1st: Aaron Nesmith  Langford/Nesmith are incomplete. Jays + Marcus are hits. James Young (at #17) was an obvious whiff, and you could make an argument that the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie."
"But why? The Nets get did nothing to nobody. Durant didn't leave to make a championship team with Irving, he left because Golden State  trainers and medical staff didn't properly find an injury that should've sidelined him for half a year at most and that neglect caused KD to aggravate it into an almost 2-year recovery and the Nets, despite their history of bad coaching staff, bad scouting staff and just bad staff, have always had the best medical staff in the league, bar none.  I get the Kyrie hate though. He's what happens when an intelligent person refuses up get educated. Like he knows just enough to have facts that he thinks back up his terrible points, when in reality, those same exact facts are what disproves it if he bothered to read just a little bit more about it. I'm clearly taking about the flat earth thing, but I think it can be applied to him more generically.  As for Harden, I didn't really like him much before he became a Net, but I also only watched him play when it was against my team or in playoffs. I didn't like his beard and thought he was sort of a shot chucker. He's proven me wrong, I absolutely love him now. I love pass-first point guards that make everyone around them look like superstars à la Jason Kidd in the New Jersey Nets golden age. And Harden is actually out there looking like Jason Kidd with a nuclear jumpshot. He's my favorite of the big 3 now and I used to hate him... KD is still the best player on the team obviously, but I love me some ball distributers.  And the rest of the Nets, Jeff Green, Joey fist pumps, Dinwiddie, TLC, Bruce Brown, they're all likeable guys, every one of them.  I'm conclusion, I sort of get the Kyrie hate."
Kyrie Irving also doesn’t have enough games either he’s at 27.7.

KYRIE IRVING
Kyrie Irving jumped in the air with the basketball in his hands and placed it within the basketball hoop
"I feel like the Nets play okay defense, definitely not good but only slightly below average, but their rebounding has to be the worst in the league. Half of the Nets contested rebounds that they bring in are from Kyrie Irving flying in 100 mph while everyone else stares."

Kyrie Irving is trying to get people into his cult as well please look at my comment.
"R/NBA CENSORED MY SELF-POST PLEASE SHARE THIS BEFORE IT IS DELETED   Tl;dr: Kyrie is undoubtedly influenced by and spreading the message of the hate group/conspiracy cult the Nation of Islam to impressionable people, and I have undeniable proof. It is an imperative that people know that a multi-millionaire athlete with millions of fans and the ability to bank roll the dissemination of this misinformation through social media marketing supports people who are unquestionably anti-Semitic, conspiratorial ,anti-vax, pseudo-intellectual, racist, anti-lgbtq+ and hateful (and Kevin Durant, JR Smith, Stephen Jackson and DeSean Jackson may be involved/complicit in this as well).   While doing research on the hate group and conspiracy cult the Nation of Islam, I found the following video/Facebook post from October2nd, 2020: https://www.facebook.com/brotherbenx/videos/kyrie-irving/753613808552135/ From a “Brother Ben X” Facebook page. In this video recording of what appears to be a Kyrie Instagram live Q&amp;A, he states that he will not be talking about politics “because with that, there comes a different language, and we will save that for a later day because I have incredible leaders that are on the front lines, shout out to my man stack 5,Steve Jack you know shoutout to 19 keys, you know, shoutout to Brother Ben X, shoutout to, just, like I said I go through an array of DMs a day and doin’ my job to connect as best as I can.”  This is when the video cuts off. As you may already know, Stephen Jackson was a part of the DeSean Jackson controversy of supporting anti-Semitism and Louis Farrakhan(https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29428606/stephen-jackson-says-eagles-desean-jackson-speaking-truth-controversial-posts)the notorious leader of the Nation of Islam who has preached wonderful things such as:                   “You are not real Jews, those of you that are not real Jews. You are the synagogue of Satan, and you have wrapped your tentacles around the U.S. government, and you are deceiving and sending this nation to hell. But I warn you in the name of Allah, you would be wise to leave me alone. But if you choose to crucify me, know that Allah will crucify you.”  “And the Christian right, with your blindness to that wicked state of Israel … can that be the holy land, and you have gay parades, and want to permit to have a gay parade in Jerusalem when no prophet ever sanctioned that behavior. How can that be the Israel, how can that be Jerusalem with secular people running the holy land when it should be the holy people running the holy land. That land is gonna be cleansed with blood!”  “Osama Bin Laden didn’t destroy the Twin Towers. That was a false flag operation to take the world’s attention away from the great disunity in America after George W. Bush stole the election.”  “I’m not an anti-Semite. I’m anti-Termite.”  Quotes from the Southern Poverty Law Center    This is not even close to an exhaustive list of the hate and conspiracy that Farrakhan and his associates in the Nation of Islam have said, but how does this relate to Kyrie? He didn’t say shoutout Farrakhan after all and shouting out Stephen Jackson is not the same as endorsing all of his views. Well in the previously mentioned Facebook post by Brother Ben X, who Kyrie shouted out to over 16k people watching him live, Brother Ben X makes his ties to Farrakhan explicit. In the body of the post is the following: “so, when she said ‘I hear Ben X all the time,’ I said yeah, you’re hearing Me... through Ben!”- Minister Louis Farrakhan (September 17th, 2020)   I watched about 2 minutes of another Brother Ben X video(https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1256414397835492 )where he states that black people are trillions of years old and that white people have only existed for 6k years before I turned off the browser for fear of my brain being fried further. Brother Ben X’s Facebook (600k+ likes 1.2m followers) has plenty of other videos about Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, he doesn't even attempt to hide his ties. The Nation of Islam and its supporters believe a wide range of conspiracies ranging from scientology's dianetics to the Jewish New World Order conspiracy to the NOI classic of the evil scientist Yakub who accidentally created the evil white race through breeding them on an island just to name a few.   This 19 keys turns out to be an Instagram account with 300kfollowers which Brother Ben X has also shouted out on Facebook as part of his BWO program which is some sort of program you must pay for in order to receive classes on things like real estate and private banking (??? Have not looked into this deeply):https://www.facebook.com/brotherbenx/videos/bwo-program/1047497469107279/?__so__=permalink&amp;__rv__=related_videos   This 19 keys Instagram posts motivational quotes, cryptocurrency advice as well as Nation of Islam conspiracy. One post(https://www.instagram.com/p/CLVMouyDkxv/) quotes Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam from 1934-1975. Elijah Muhammad was a humble man who has just as many wonderful quotes as Louis such as:   (5 days after the death of Malcom X) “Malcolm got just what he preached.”    Or from Elijah’s book Message to the Blackman in America(1965) which is 5 stars on Amazon with over 2k reviews and suggests black people segregate themselves from the rest of society “either here or elsewhere.”:  “The so-called American Negroes have never had a Divine Messenger sent to them before the Honorable Elijah Muhammad”  “Beware of the national elections, my black brothers and sisters. There is no salvation in them for you—only false promises. The only salvation for you and me now is in unity and being under the guidance of Allah through His Messenger and His program for us all.”   Clearly Elijah was a humble prophet.    I do not see how Kyrie Irving can shoutout these people(19_keys and Brother Ben X)  without being aware of the hate and conspiracies that are a part of these people’s belief systems. This is a man who believed the flat-earth shit for fuck's sake and he admits he reads random peoples DMs to “connect.” Sure it’s possible Kyrie is totally against or ignorant of the Nation of Islam connection or what the Nation of Islam believes, but this seems much less likely than the possibility Kyrie has been radicalized.     Why does all this matter, why not let kooks be kooks? Because along with spreading hate, the Nation of Islam also is anti-vaccination and regularly warns their followers to not get the Covid vaccine due to x y or z conspiracy (Bill Gates comes up a lot). I do not hate Kyrie Irving or the people who believe these things, however it is an imperative that people know that a multi-millionaire athlete with millions of fans and the ability to bankroll the dissemination of this misinformation through social media marketing supports people who are unquestionably anti-Semitic, conspiratorial, anti-vax, pseudo-intellectual, racist, anti-lgbtq+ and hateful (and Kevin Durant, JR Smith, Stephen Jackson and DeSean Jackson may be involved/complicit in this as well).    I googled Kyrie Irving and the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan and saw nothing talking about this. Please share this information with journalists or on social media. People need to know that Kyrie is leading impressionable people into a literal conspiracy cult. I also from here on it will refuse to give any money to the NBA until this is addressed and urge those who care to do the same"
James Haren  Kevin Urant   Kyrie Irving
"Irving is already a starter  So already locked was Embiid, Giannis, KD, Kyrie and Beal  Yet to be called out but very likely would be Tatum and Brown, Simmons or Tobias Harris, Bam Adebayo, Gordon Hayward, Trae Young, Vucevic, Middleton, Sabonis, Randle, Vanvleet/Lowry/Siakam, oh and of course James Harden has gotta be a lock.   Of that full list the guys that probably won't make it would be Randle, maybe Vuc or Bam so there is a ton of competition still and I didn't even throw LaVine into the list.   But basically of that list the following teams will have to have an all star just because of their standings and success and those would be Boston, Indiana, Charlotte, Toronto. So that's 4 spots completely locked up with Boston likely being 2 all stars so really 5 spots. Then Harden will very likely get a spot. That leaves 1 spot left now which will be fought for between Middleton, LaVine, Bam, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Vucevic, Julius Randle. I can see LaVine making it over all those guys just cause of the season he is having but then again the way Beal didn't make the roster last year and Beal was clearly a better player than Trae Young but still Trae got the spotlight at the time. But still LaVine is on a better team and is having a more efficient season from a numbers perspective than Beal was at the time."
Giannis ‘Attempt a free throw’   Kyrie ‘World B. Flat’ Irving   James ‘Jimbo Slice’ Harden  Paul ‘Pandemic/Wayoff P’ George   [and my new fav as of late LeWhereDidHeGo James](https://youtu.be/S_FTjZY-AkI)
"his epm is 27th overall  his BPM is 4.3, which is pretty close to Kyrie Irving at 4.6  I'm pretty sure he's a top 30 player by most metrics now. His +/- sucks, but the bulls purposefully play all their bad young players as starters for some reason  He used to be an empty stats guy, but he's gotten incrementally better every year, and last two seasons is legitimately good, especially this one"
"The clippers traded baron davis and a 1st for Mo Williams, way back in blake's 2nd season. Not an awful trade at the time, but the clippers pick jumped from 10th to 1st for the Cavs, who then took kyrie irving. That one hurts for sure."
"Love seeing players who deserve to play go to teams where they can shine. Dude literally was a starter on an eastern conference final team making clutch shots, then he had to ride the bench cuz of Kyrie Irving, and now he's shining in Charlotte, happy for this dude, happy for my fantasy team too cuz no one wanted to draft this guy, not me though"
"&gt; iso  isolation, meaning one-on-one. on some plays you will notice the guy with the ball working with a screen, other times they clear a whole side of the court and just let him try to beat his man. that would be iso.  &gt;3&amp;D guys  just means guys that can shoot threes and play defense well. valuable archetype of player, because everybody needs good defenders and if you can just stand there and hit open threes you are valuable on offense. it's basically the ideal mold for a role player.  &gt;wing defenders  wings are a pretty broad term for guys that play the 2 or 3 (usually 3s probably?). bigger than your small guards, but not big guys that sit in the paint. lebron, paul george, kawhi, jayson tatum type players.  &gt; off ball players  just meaning they do a lot of work without the ball. creating separation so you can shoot is huge in basketball, some guys are very good at creating this without the ball in their hands.   if you have any other specific questions feel free to ask.  &gt;Which player's highlights would you recommend to get me really hooked on the game? Damian Lillard's half court game winners are absolutely electric imo.  my favorite non-sun to watch is kyrie irving. probably the best dribbling skills in the history of the league, and just one of the smoothest players to ever do it. i've heard people say before that he plays the game in cursive and i think that fits his playstyle  https://youtu.be/HeK6Z-OR7gY?t=43  one of my favorite highlight videos of all time"
"Lebron/Wade/Bosh in Miami, Curry/Durant/Klay/Draymond in GSW and the Durant/Harden/Irving in BKN are the only teams I consider to be superteams in the past 10 years   I can see the argument for the Cavs but I disagree cause I don’t see Kyrie being that unfair as a second option, plus Love was not even that unfair as a third option tbh"

"Not to shit on Joe Harris; he's an excellent shooter. Having said that, any competent three point threat would have roided up numbers if they were starting on the Nets.  Harris is good, but lets be real. He's putting up those numbers because he's got so much freedom to shoot the ball because the Nets have Kyrie, Harden, and Durant. If Joe Harris is putting 40 on you, your defensive game is pretty god damn good.  Harris is a good shooter, it just bugs me when people attribute  his numbers to his growth or him being in a ""system that allows him to finally shine"". Its none of that. He is just a good three point shooter on a team with James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant."
"Lakers shot the same amount of 3s today that they average for the season which indicates that the Nets weren't giving them more open looks then the average team. Your question is dumb as shit, do you actually think Kyrie Irving is going to go 0/5 from 3 every game?  It's really funny how Lakers fans outwardly dismiss this game yet are sensitive af about it"
"Ummm, yeah, turns out they do?   Besides, if you’re a media member, and you’ve got to decide between Irving, Harden, Lillard, Luka, Steph... it’s not unreasonable to leave Kyrie off."
"i mean when you have James Harden and Kyrie Irving, I'd sure hope so they are still good"
You're not beating 2 MVPs and Kyrie Irving with Ben Simmons  Brooklyn will trample through the East

Yes because Kyrie Irving is the absolute epitome of professionalism.

Kyrie Irving?! Wtf
Kyrie play when I want Irving
What’s debatable about it? The wizards stink when Beal plays. Across the board Kyrie hs been more efficient and effective than Beal. No one would take Beal over Irving in a must win game either
"they traded away two old ass players for those picks. they absolutely robbed the nets. its ainge's credit for finding the dumbest gm/owner in the league but they absolutely robbed those players.   Most teams that get those picks dont also have their own picks. boston got smart with its own pick. Most bad teams only get their own pick, boston was picking twice in the first round for 5 years basically. Most teams also that get those picks arent decent free agent destinations. boston was able to get hayward/kemba/horford, most teams cant pull those guys in free agency.  I think the fact that ainge hit on those picks so well is more an illustration on how much hes mismanaged/got unlucky with the rest of the team. kyrie irving trade was a huge flop, trading for such a mercurial personality seems like ainge didnt do his homework on kyrie. Hayward they got unlucky with but his departure seems to be an issue. Retaining him would've kept boston in the title picture this year. Now there are no easy ways to improve the roster around tatum and brown for the next few seasons.   The team is getting worse while its stars are significantly better. Obviously boston did well reaching the ECF three times in the last 5 years, but 2 of those years the east was a virtual joke. The closest to an actual contender boston ever was probably last season.Most people would agree that boston had a once in a lifetime opportunity with all those picks and weren't able to create an actual contender. Now it doesnt look like there is any immediate path to a contender either. Nets have loaded up, Giannis and embiid look like they're in another class right now. Sixers ill give the celtics the benefit of the doubt over since they've bounced them multiple times but the bucks and nets arent going anywhere for the next 2 years. By then browns extension is getting close to up and theres no guarantee those guys stay in boston."

I'm just going to go if sports never existed.  Pau Gasol - Surgeon  Gordon Hayward - video game developer  James Harden - strip club bouncer  Kyrie Irving - curator of a Ripley's believe it or not
Kendrick Perkins said to trade Kyrie Irving for JJ Redick
https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/report-kyrie-irving-was-convinced-lebron-james-camp-tried-get-him-traded  While Lebron has never requested a trade he has never stayed loyal to a team for 8 years. At least harden let Houston get 9 picks from him.
So in that case would Kyrie Irving not be considered better than both Dame &amp; Harden at shooting? Is Joe Harris not a better shooter than Harden because of the ast %s?   Either way I think Dame &amp; Harden are toss ups. Different play styles. The ratio was just wild to me. -9 downvotes to +11 upvotes. Making it seem like we were comparing Ray Allen to Stephen Jackson
"It’s sad that we’ve been let down by the government to this extent.   Kyrie Irving helped feed my kin when people were struggling through the pandemic while the congress was giving themselves another pay raise, more benefits, and taking paid vacation time."
"Dudes the most important player on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on it, but his scoring stats won't be enough because he's facilitating. The assists tite is dope and being 50/40/90 is dope."
Let me simplify for you:  Do they make that comeback without LeBron James? No. Do they get LeBron James either the first or second time without lottery luck? Also no.   Do they make that comeback without Kyrie Irving? No. Do they get Kyrie Irving without lottery luck? Also no.   Nobody is out here saying the Cavs have an asterisk on the title or that the ring doesn’t count. But to pretend like that team wasn’t lucky when ping pong balls built the core of the roster is laughable.
"Kyrie Irving Ron Harper LeBron James Brad Daugherty  Hot Rod Williams  Mark Price Jordan Clarkson Kevin Love Larry Nance Shawn Kemp Kyle Korver  The Lakers have insane bigs so it is a massive task keeping Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, and AD at bay so this team is F/C heavy and Price, Love, Kyrie, and Korver might be able to avoid them inside by stretching the court with their shooting  Prime Kobe vs near-prime Harper would be fun to watch. I tip it to Kobe but Harper’s defense gives us our best shot"

But don't stick too hard to one team at the start, you'll find what you like over time   &gt;Is youth development different in the NBA in comparison to hockey and soccer?  Very. In the NBA teams have nothing to do with the players basically until they are drafted.    &gt;Do players that get drafted in round 1 make the roster right away, or do they play in college for 4 years and then compete for a roster spot or play on the farm team  If you're a 1st round pick your contract is already guaranteed, so the team is gonna be paying you no matter what, so they pretty much all play on the team for at least a bit. Some of them won't last on their teams and in the league, but the guys at the top all generally do. The 2nd round is a different story, their contracts aren't guaranteed and the majority of them never make their teams roster and they never play in the NBA.   Players never draft someone and have them go to college, you'll kind of see it with Europeans who get drafted by a team but stay and play in Europe, but never still going to college. To be drafted players also have to be a year removed from highschool, which usually means playing a year in college before heading to the NBA.   &gt; I understand drafts are essential but do picks have very high value or do teams just trade them continually?  Picks have a high value, but it's a pretty steep value curve, the ones at the top are worth much more than ones later on. How this value works out depends on the draft and how many good players there are. A top 3 pick in a good draft can be worth five times a pick at 12. Teams do trade picks a lot, usually as a move to help them win now at the expense of success in the future. As such most of the picks that get traded are from good teams that are expecting their picks to not be very high anyway (examples like the Nets, Lakers, Bucks), but sometimes doesn't work out and not very good teams owe picks (Rockets, TWolves, the Nets of the past).     &gt;Are there lots of young players that get drafted later rounds that actually make it to the NBA rosters or do they get trapped on the farm team and used as trade bait/salary moves?   It's pretty common for 2nd round draft picks to make it onto NBA teams. It's less than half, especially as you get to the end of the draft, but not insignificant each draft. There's also stars that every once in a while come from the 2nd round, Jokic is currently an MVP candidate and he was the 41st pick. I wouldn't say they get trapped on the farm team (in the NBA this is called the G-League), but it's pretty common for them to be sent down to get reps. You will see 2nd round picks and players moved pretty often, they aren't seen to carry a lot of value, but they are probably the cheapest asset that is still positive value.   &gt;Do top picks bust frequently, as a Canadian, I do know that the hype on Wiggins and Bennett completely died out after 1 year. I haven't kept a close eye on them but it seems that they couldn't transition their game/skills to an NBA starter level?  I wouldn't say frequently, but it definitely ain't unheard of. I think failing to make it to the level of a starter is rarer (Wiggins is actually a starter), but it's pretty common to not meet expectations.   In 2018 Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick and probably won't be a good player, Markelle Fultz in 2017 was the 1st pick but immediately disappointed and is now just a good player, Dragan Bender in 2016 with the 4th pick is already out of the league. There seems to be at least one high level prospect per draft who doesn't get near their expectations.   &gt;I watch hockey and soccer, but the Salary Cap and contract situation in the NBA is much different, based on my understanding, it seems to promote rich owners to throw money and build super teams, so does it make the NBA a bit stale to watch?  There is a salary cap in the NBA, it's just a soft cap, and there is also a cap on the salaries of players. So you can go over the cap, but there are a bunch of restrictions to limit your ability to do so, primarily you can go over the cap to sign players that are already on your team, but you can't go over the cap to get other teams players. However, going over the cap does lead to you ending up in the luxury tax, which the more you go into the more expensive it gets  There's still a big market advantage, but it's to varying degrees. My Nets were able to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency because they are located in New York, but also because they have shown themselves to be a competent franchise who can get some modicum of success. While across the city the Knicks are the most valuable franchise in the NBA, and they haven't been able to get a free agent in close to 10 years because they are so bad. So rich owners (so long as they aren't cheap) have less impact, but the markets teams are in have an impact. The big exception to this I would say is the Lakers, who I think has just a massive free-agent advantage over other teams  On the other hand, some small-market teams are able to hold onto really high-level players over the long term. As I said before there is a player salary cap, where players can only be paid so much. But this quantity is affected by a range of things, firstly how long a player has been in the league, secondly if a player signs with their own team then they can get more and for longer, and thirdly if they are eligible for getting the supermax, which you have to reach certain performance levels for and you can only get re-signing with your team. For example, this led to Giannis Antetokounmpo resigning a 5-year supermax deal with his very small market team the Bucks   &gt;Which NBA organizations are the best to consider supporting for?    Listen to that aforementioned podcast. You want to get on board with a team that is still on the way up, and that once they get there they have a chance to stick around for a while. Just listening to your description of what you want in your team I'd consider anyone except Knicks, Nets, Lakers, Clippers, Warriors because they tend to be the centres of a lot of drama and free agent talk, and just due to competence anyone except the Twolves, Kings, or Wizards, and maybe the Pistons  Just listening to your criteria I think Grizzlies might be a strong option, they are an alright team currently, but they are built around a great young core that should find success in the future. And the franchise has an incredibly strong identity that envelops the team, the Grizzlies are synonymous with Grit and Grind and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Oh and Ja Morant pretty frequently fucks people up with his dunks"
"Kyrie I. No, that’s too obvious, let’s say K. Irving."
[https://www.nba.com/news/kyrie-irving-called-lebron-james-apologize](https://www.nba.com/news/kyrie-irving-called-lebron-james-apologize)  You're combining two different situations
"Kyrie ""Bilbo Baggins"" Irving"
[He was officially accepted into the tribe back in 2017](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24444427/kyrie-irving-embraces-native-american-heritage-sioux-naming-ceremony-nba)
What kind of pants is Kyrie Irving wearing?
"On a team with KD and Kyrie Irving, currently sitting at the 3rd seed in the EAST"
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
James Harden Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it's unfair how they're all on the same team
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
Kyrie Irving has been a phenomenal player and leader for us on and off the court. Suck it haters.

"I can't believe how I need to point out how Harden's usage has collapsed compared to prior seasons because he is now on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. It's literally the lowest it has been since he was coming off the bench in OKC. You apparently seem to know that yourself, but completely disregard it?  Not to mention that despite Harden's usage being way down, he's still playing 5 minutes more per game than Stephen Curry is. Is it that unbelievable to you that Curry is averaging 1.5 less FTA than Harden?  Curry is not unfairly officiated. He does essentially the same shit (but to a lesser extent) and receives the same calls as a notorious foul-baiter. It just looks like you're trying to believe something that clearly isn't true out of some blind love for a player.  and no, I'm not trying to be an asshole. It's not that serious."
Kyrie Irving...?
Kyrie Irving is a better pure scorer than James Harden
Kyrie irving did 9/11
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
"Wut? If J-Kidd had Kyrie Irving and KD as teammates, he'd averaged like 15 assists per game. Harden is a great facilitator, but that great."
Kyrie Irving is good at basketball
"Harden has played 14 games with the Nets, he has had 10+ assists in 12 of those games.  Irving has played 13 games with Harden and hasnt had a single double digit assist game.    When Kyrie said that Harden was the PG and he would be the shooting guard, I think he got the timeline a little wrong."
Kyrie Irving is pretty decent at basketball

Kyrie Irving has entered the chat.
"I desperately hoped we might eek out a W in the end but this was the expected outcome. Tough loss, but I’m proud our guys took 2 MVPs and Kyrie Irving to overtime on the second half of a back to back."
Where do you think Kyrie Irving gets all that hair growth from? ;)
"Strictly from the perspective of skill set and bag of tricks, Kyrie Irving has to be top 10 all-time right?"
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"Hello, I am an official outsider Kyrie Irving attorney. Please tag me if anyone is slandering my man so I can reassure them with facts and logic. Thank you."
People haven’t been watching Brooklyn Nets basketball if they don’t think Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA right now.  The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship.
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
"I would be surprised if we don't retire Kyrie Irving. He hit possibly the most important shot in franchise history over Stephen Curry. I get we ended on a bad note, but I think he did more than enough when he was here to deserve it."

It's a matter if time before steph curry is traded for Kyrie Irving. According the Onion.
Loved: Bam Adebayo  Hated: Kyrie Irving
"Nah man.   Miami staff just didn't want Bam to get any influence from Kyrie ""I fly in planes and regularly see the curvature of the Earth but somehow still think its flat"" Irving."
"The Big Three   Kevin Durant , Kyrie Irving and Joe Harris"
"It will be interesting to see how long this record lasts. Kevin Love got close to breaking it in 2016 when he had his 34 point first quarter, but thanks to Kyrie Irving refusing to pass him the ball at the end of the quarter, he fell short.  30 point quarters are extremely rare (I think there's only been 10 in history), and you are going to need closer to 40 than 30 to break Klay's record."
"the difference between the dlo all-star year nets and the year after nets was levert, dinwiddie, and harris all developing into better players and that ""nothing new"" included kyrie irving lol"
"Yeah, Kyrie ""want my jersey retired in Boston"" Irving is defo real as hell lmao. Gtfo with this take"
Outscoring your other team without playing defence never worked before but this Nets team is different. They have two of the three best offensive players and then Kyrie fucking Irving. “They better never miss” might actually be possible for once lol
"That's what Kyrie thought too. That Lebron must have okayed it. But Lebron was always against trading Kyrie.  &gt;According to the Athletic, when then-Cavs coach Tyronn Lue learned that the Irving trade was about to happen, he drove to meet James and put the latter on the phone with Cleveland General Manager Koby Altman. James was described as “adamant” that Irving should not be dealt away, and Altman reportedly assured the four-time MVP that the trade would not occur.  &gt;A few minutes later, it did, James discovered to his noticeable dismay. At an autograph-signing event in California, James “dropped the pen and slumped in his chair,” per Vardon.  &gt;James suggested that he felt he wasn’t deceived by Altman so much as the GM may have been overruled by Cavs owner Dan Gilbert. James also implied that Gilbert, with whom he had a frosty relationship dating back at least to the owner’s infamous “comic sans” letter in 2010, had ousted former general manager David Griffin to gain more control over his team’s personnel moves.  &gt;“Take nothing from Koby, because Koby [was just named GM], but at that point in time, you realize that Koby’s not the only one running the team, as [Griffin] had done, and that’s why Griff was let go, pretty much,” James said."
&gt;Kyrie 'tanked value' Irving is averaging 30- 4.5- 7 on 52-43-90 from the field having by far his best statistical season.
Kobe Bryant is a legend. We loved him even though he was not always efficient or a willing passer. He would average like 27-5-4 on 44% shooting he was great    Kyrie 'tanked value' Irving is averaging 30- 4.5- 7 on 52-43-90 from the field having by far his best statistical season.  Yeah he's an average defender but his value being tanked is a bad narrative.
"Irving coming back gives them another potent offensive weapon, but  a huge liability to cover for on the defensive end. His skillset might be redundant with harden being a better scorer  and passer than kyrie"
"&gt; Collin Sexton is good, but He's no Kyrie Irving though  Considering all of the baggage that comes with Kyrie, and with how injury prone he is, I'd take Sexton over him right now."
"listen, I know Cleveland feels good since they beat the nets twice, but I promise you, that trade package for Kyrie was horrible. Don't let recency bias tell you otherwise. Collin Sexton is good, but He's no Kyrie Irving though."
Kyrie Irving sat  did some good and got fined too  while they won more games
"“WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN, KYRIE IRVING?”"
Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.
"&gt;Irving wanted to go to Brooklyn to have control over everything.  I thought he wanted to go to the Celtics so he could be the man, then signed with the Nets and Durant once he realized he didn't want to be the man.  I know someone suggested starting Kyrie for like 5 minutes then basically setting it up so he plays with the bench players after that, lol. That might work."
To be honest Kyrie Irving does it way often and cleaner
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20421382/cleveland-cavaliers-send-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-deal-including-isaiah-thomas  The Nets pick turned into Sexton who is developing great and having a hot year.  Isaiah Thomas(all-star 2016-17) played hurt for Boston in the previous year's playoffs, hurt himself more and never returned to greatness.  Lebron James would leave Cleveland for LA at the end of that season."
You don't think that'll make Kyrie just as pissy? Dude was a fucking child anytime someone took a shot he wanted in Boston. The idea he's going to be okay with his playtime dictated by Harden's schedule/minutes is laughable to me.  Irving wanted to go to Brooklyn to have control over everything. Now with Harden and Nash there it's the exact opposite scenario. I guess if you can make him feel like staggered minutes were his idea.

"Kyrie Irving is a bum lol, I’m pretty sure he plays like 40 games a year 😂"
"KD bruh you could've just stayed in the Bay. You wanted to play with Kyrie ""World B Flat"" Irving and now you gotta figure this shit out. Good luck lol."
"Me: *sees [Kyrie Irving], grabs popcorn* Kyrie: *gives reasonable commentary* Me: idk how to feel"
It is a big deal when you have fucking James Harden and kyrie Irving lol
“We have good pieces but it’s pretty glaring that we need a couple more pieces to complement myself” - Kyrie Irving
-Kyrie Irving
Feels not great to be on the business end of Kyrie Irving going off but also fun to watch the Cavs deliberately pick on him as a defender.
Kyrie Irving is screaming in the Nets locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Irving comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Irving is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
This is the Kyrie Irving Boston Celtics.. change muh mind
Kyrie Irving is really fucking good. I don't get people singling him out as if he's the main reason the Nets are losing. I do understand the people that want him to cede some usage to James Harden though.
I'm guessing James Harden and Kyrie Irving don't like each other.
Harden isn't going to get sacrificed for this shit LOL  A duo of James Harden and Kyrie Irving should be a complete showcase of isolation.
Kyrie Irving is still the dumbest shot taker alive.
"My opinion: Not as trash as some people on /r/nba say, but also not good.  Also my opinion: That doesn't mean much though as long as they are serviceable and are able to grab some defensive pieces, because they have fucking Kevin Durant. They also have fucking James Harden. Not to mention that they also have Kyrie Irving."
"Wait so you’re telling me a defense with James harden kyrie irving and Deandre Jordan isn’t good? Shocking absolutely shocking.  BKN has serious defensive concerns but if they figure it out on offense (kyrie doesn’t go on an ego trip like in Boston) and harden feels comfortable enough to really take control of the offense and not be so passive to feed kyries ego, they should be fine."
"All Nba point guard with All team defense quality is not just an ""okay"" number 1 pick. Since Rose in 2008, of all players selected 1st, Davis is the only one clearly better. Wall, Blake, Towns, Kyrie have not that much more. I know Irving has the title and the amazing performances but he was on an amazing team with Cleveland."
My post mentioning Kyrie Irving was deleted almost instantly last week
Ringer did a somewhat decent article on why jazz seem to struggle in playoffs. [ringer article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/6/22216763/utah-jazz-defense-kyrie-irving-nets)
"Stephen Curry comes from a long line of basketball demon slayers; Curry is the family name of a lineage of humans that cooked basketball offerings for the basketball Gods, cast down by the basketball gods for flying too close to the stars.  In response, the lineage turned to demon slaying as a way to redeem themselves before the Basketball Gods, training to shoot the ball far enough away from demons so as not to be slain by their infernal pressure.     Each member of the Curry Clan is tasked at birth with slaying a specific demon.  Steph, a particular promising Curry, was tasked with defeating the basketball demon Dribbadon, Demon-god of Handles.  It is believed that Kyrie Irving, upon activating his third eye, will summon Dribbadon into this world to kill beautiful, team first basketball and replace it with ballhogging Demon-iso play.     Curry tried to summon Dribbadon early, as a way to save Kyrie and possibly all of basketball, by defeating him in the NBA tournament of champions and keep him from activating his 3rd eye.  When Kyrie came into the league, he seemed to have no chance of getting to the Championship -- the expectation for activating his 3rd sight and summoning Dribbadon -- due to being on a terrible team with no change in sight.  Curry was taught diligence at a young age though and, despite seemingly not needing to worry about Kyrie, he still trained and prepared for needing to beat Kyrie if the time arose...and almost out of nowhere it did.    Suddenly LeBron James, Chosen champion of the Gods of Basketball, decided to return to his home -- coincidentally being where Kyrie Irving resided.  Over night the team transformed into a championship level team that rivaled anything in the NBA at the time, and -- it seemed -- Curry was not ready yet.  Except he was, by the  grace of the Gods of Basketball -- injuries to key Cleveland players -- he was.     For a year he was.  Right when it was believed the Warriors would be able to defeat the Cavs a second time and keep Kyrie's eye from activating at all -- and possibly leading to the fickle LeBron leaving his hometown yet again -- the warriors inexplicably lost a 3-1 lead for the first time in championship history.  But this was on purpose.  Curry, the clever skyfucker that he is, had reasoned that it wasn't *just* about winning.  No, Kyrie needed to win *because* of him and his demonic handles, not just as a secondary factor.  Almost in unison Curry knew that he needed to prepare and Kyrie, whether by his own design or that of Dribbadon leaking into the real world, knew that he needed to leave the good thing in Cleveland and find a way to win while being ""the man""... as only then could his 3rd eye activate.  Seeing that his power alone would not be enough, Curry set up to lose the championship game as a way to bring in Kevin Durant, a fledgling Basketball Reaper (basketball champions tasked with helping demon slayers in their tasks, often without even knowing their role in the otherworldly battle).     This lead to Kyrie ultimately leaving for the Celtics and Curry bringing KD onto his team, both sides preparing for an ultimate, final battle.  But... somehow Kyrie getting back to the championship never happened.  Not for trying -- being on stacked teams again and again -- but it just never happened.  In the meantime, Curry has been keeping his power level low, conserving energy until the day Kyrie finally reaches the championship again and possibly activates his 3rd eye, summoning Dribbadon to our world.     There have been small stirrings, people wondering if Kyrie has somehow been slowly activating his 3rd eye in other ways.  While World B. Flat seems to be the going crazy, those with links to the HoF Pantheon of basketball wonder if perhaps he is seeing the world beyond our world -- a flat endless world of black and white...Gods and demons... makes and misses.  There is a worry that perhaps there is another way to activate the demon's eye...and so Curry waits for the coming of Kyrie's 3rd eye.  Of Dribbadon.  Of his purpose.    Anime Title Screen - SkyFucker: Chef of the Gods."
"Kyrie Irving - aside from when lebron was there to keep him in check, he has been the worst offender for this IMO. He gets his numbers but the team suffers and doesn’t get the W. Stops the ball so much that other players can’t get any rhythm, kills chemistry and is non-existent on D, allowing as many points as he scores. He is also an incredibly skilled offensive player so it takes a lot of bad to outweigh that, but he manages somehow. Nets should trade him for some defence.   That being said, he is really fun to watch!"

"""You're just a pawn."" - Kyrie Irving"
"We all agree man. The problem is they don’t look like they’re set up to play 2-way, winning-basketball.  Kyrie scoring 37, KD drops 38, Harden drops a triple double and the team stilllllllll can’t beat Cleveland. That’s the problem.   Kevin Durant is a dumbass for packaging himself to Kyrie Irving in free agency. Durant, Harden, Allen, Lavert, and all those future firsts??? That’s a title team right there. Durant, Harden, no bench, and Kyrie when he decides he wants to show up??? Sorry, have fun with those division title banners cause there’s no rings on the way with Kyrie running the franchise"

"Kyrie will be their Doom, i think they would work a lot better as a powerhouse duo than with a 3rd wheel with overlapping skills. I would trade Irving for 2 pieces that would fit to make the nets a team to be feared"
"Lakers aren’t playing particularly well and the nets didn’t have Kyrie Irving, bucks don’t have any bench depth"
Fuck [him](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/bostons-kyrie-irving-excited-to-now-be-playing-in-a-real-live-sports-city/)
"As a big Game of Zones fan, I watched their portrayal of Kyrie thinking: this content is ridiculous and way the hell too obsessed with Kyrie Irving.  This season I have learned that *real life* is ridiculous and way the hell too obsessed with Kyrie Irving. Apologies to GoZ, they got it right again."
What about Kyrie Irving without the mental instability?
Making a point? Kyrie Irving didn’t take any bad shots. He shot 15-28 too. Kyrie was by far the best player of the Big 3 on the court in the first 3 quarter of that game. Embarrassing box score blog boys.
"I want to see how we handle James Harden and Kyrie Irving being guarded by serviceable defenders in space. Gasol can’t be on the floor with AD in that series.  AD is an elite defensive big, but Harden has show a willingness to pick on even AD in the PNR, so has Kyrie.   We could try AD and Gasol but Gasol is a dead man against Kyrie/Harden/Durant in PNR, and AD is a dead man on KD.  The abuse Gasol would take from Kyrie and Harden isn’t worth it.  It’ll be as followed  Harden/Kyrie/Joe/KD/DJ vs Dennis/KCP/AC or Wes/Bron/AD  The Nets have two heavily favorable matchups whereas the lakers only really have one.  It’s gonna be a shootout of a series. Dennis will be the X factor for the lakers I think. They have good team defense, but in that series the PNR defense kinda has to be on an island and Lakers will need extra scoring punch out of Dennis to help compensate."
Kyrie Irving?
"Lebron has won at least one championship and MVP, he is no longer a bust no matter what happens. Harden has won the MVP and never even made it to the finals. No he abandoned his team for the second best player in the NBA and also MVP/champion KD, and nba champion kyrie irving. He's saying this season is going to be ""like a movie, watch out"". Once again, Shaq is right and you are wrong deal with it"
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
I thought this was an interesting prospective on Kyrie Irving and the decisions he's made in the past few weeks.
"Kyrie Irving didn’t take any bad shots. James Harden took a bad shot towards the end of regulation. I have no problems who takes the most shots in the game, unless they’re taking terrible shots or having an off night shooting wise."
"Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. The Brooklyn Nets have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Brooklyn Nets are very fun to watch. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship."
"Media clown with a clown take. A “Yes Man” doesn’t take a step back 3 when the game is tied with less than a minute left in regulation.   James Harden wasn’t born with the clutch gene. He has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on his team, but a “Yes Man” took that shot? Okay buddy. Kyrie Irving looked like a “Yes Man” more than James Harden when he had to inbound the ball in the last play of the first OT.  The Brooklyn Nets don’t have any “Yes Men” on their team. I’m not going to overreact to one regular season game. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the championship."
"Bingo Smith - *10 Seasons - Averaged 13.2 points, 4.2 rebounds in 720 games*  Zydrunas Ilgauskas - 12 Seasons - *Averaged 13.8 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.6 blocks in 771 games - 2x All-Star*  Larry Nance - 8 Seasons - *Averaged 16.7 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.5 blocks in 434 games - All-NBA Defensive 1st, 2x All-Star*  Mark Price - 9 Seasons - *Averaged 16.4 points, 7.2 assists, 1.3 steals in 582 games - All-NBA 1st, 4x All-Star*  Austin Carr - 9 Seasons - *Averaged 16.2 points in 635 games - All-Star*  Nate Thurmond - 2 Seasons - *Averaged 5.0 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.5 blocks in 114 game*  Brad Daughtery - 8 Seasons - *Averaged 19.0 points, 9.5 rebounds in 548 games - 5x All-Star*  Kyrie Irving - 6 Seasons - *Averaged 22.5 points, 5.7 Assist, 3.7 rebounds, 1.3 steals - 4x All-Star, All-NBA 3rd, NBA Champion*  If Cleveland doesn't retire Kyrie's jersey it's pure pettiness. He's arguably their 2nd greatest player of all time."
Kyrie Irving
Sexton is nasty ruined big 3's debut and kyrie was pissed straight up elbowed him in the face. K irving is turning into trash
"Kyrie ‘Kyle Kuzma’ Irving.   No but seriously the guy has been nothing but issues since coming to the nets, barely playing, starting controversies, leaving, it’s just annoying and if he doesn’t play absolutely flawless and win every night im gonna point the blame his way. Maybe unfairly at times but still gonna do it."
Wow that guy is like the Kyrie Irving of blog bois isn't he
"&gt;	There is an old expression from revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg: “Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.” This quote rattles in the back of my mind as NBA commentators and fans rage against Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving. He is choosing to move, and by doing so, revealing the realities of restraints.  [Well...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/967/spongebob.jpg)"
"Don't know if anyone point that out but Colin Fucking Sexton outscored Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving COMBINED in the 2 OTs 22 to 19!  Moreover he made 0 turn over while the Big 3 made 2.  Cleveland have a new king, the future is bright for Sexton and the Cavs."

I remember thinking they won the trade by a mile and dreaming of a Cavs warriors rematch. It seemed like the Cavs way got better and with the addition of Wade and Rose everyone said they were reloaded. Nets were good and would’ve made the playoffs but D’lo had a knee injury and I think Jeremy Lin got really hurt vs the pacers. Look at this trade grade   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2017/08/23/kyrie-irving-isaiah-thomas-cavaliers-celtics-trade-grades-analysis
Bro they wouldn’t trade fucking Kyrie Irving for a dude would be out of the league in 3 years no matter what pick you attached. You on that purp refer
"ESPN needs to make a 30 for 30 about that pick lol   The fact that Brooklyn originally included it in the trade with Boston that landed them KG and Paul Pierce.  And then it got traded to Cleveland as part of the package that landed Kyrie Irving on the Celtics.  It was THEN used to select Con Sexton 8th overall, who went on to lead the Cavs in a victory against the Brooklyn Nets I. The debut of their New Big 3, of which Kyrie Irving was one."
"Start by watching highlights of some of the games best like MJ, LeBron, Sexton. If you want to see the importance of team basketball watch some of the Spurs clips from several years back or watch Kyrie Irving clips and pay attention to how he is a black hole that sucks the life out of his teammates"
"James Harden is a good defender.   Kyrie Irving, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Landry Shamet are terrible defenders though. Landry Shamet wasn’t part of the rotation today and I hope Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry aren’t part of the rotation soon.   Jarrett Allen was a big loss, but the Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship."
"If you like a gritty underdog story with incredible highs, devastating lows, and lovable young knuckle heads coming together to strangle any bit of recognition and attention from the star studded league there is no better choice than the Cleveland Cavaliers   You'd be walking in at an opportune time as well seeing as how our storylines and narratives are all fresh young and twisting and turning as we speak, it may seem unpredictable at times but we always BELIEVE in CLEVELAND   Though you may want to scuttle in now while the iron is hot- the KPJ Saga might be coming to a close and we just beat a super team after our #2 Young Bull, Collin 'Sexman' Sexton just achieved his next level of power to put our old superstar #2 Kyrie irving and the Nets to bed in a double OT  Imo we're easily one of the most gripping teams to watch, they won't fail to keep you on your toes (hell of an emotional rollercoaster to ride sometimes though)  Well come on then! Join the fight! For glory! For honor! For some God damn respect plain and simple! All for one and one for all! Go Cavs!  (This concludes my teaser for the Cleveland Cavaliers anime; season 50 ⚔️)"
"It's not something that can't be addressed, but Kyrie really interrupts the flow of the offense - especially with Harden out there.    Harden is constantly getting the other guys involved whether it be via his isolations (drive and kick) or in the pick and roll.  He might be doing it to a fault, but I think it's good that he spends the early portion of the game trying to get other guys going.  He's making the right reads and the right plays.    Kyrie clearly isn't the poing guard that Harden is but I feel like he needs to do that more.  Out of his isolation I feel like it's 70/30 of whether or not he's going to take the shot vs pass it regardless of shot quality.  Shooting midrange  contested jumpshot even as Kyrie Irving is not the shot that an offense with Harden/Irving/Durant should ever be content with unless Durant is the one taking the shot.  I think it's tough for Kyrie since he's honestly kinda redundant with Harden, but I want to see him play within the flow of the offense more.  He can still isolate, but he has too many good teammates  to sit there and isolate and shoot like 70% of the time he gets the ball.  It definitely *can* work, but Kyrie can't do what he did tonight.  It's going to be even more exaggerated when he's not on fire from the field in the first half."
"KD thought going to Brooklyn would get him some slack from NBA fans and overreactions, but in less than a month, he got Kyrie Irving acting crazy, James Harden traded to his team, and lost to a lottery team... all with the drama coming back."
Dude Kyrie Irving loves basketball he’s just having some mental health issues.
"Not only that, it's the BKN pick acquired from Boston in the Kyrie Irving trade lol"

Kevin Durant. James Harden. Kyrie Irving.... still not enough to stop Collin Sexton tonight.
Kyrie Irving got schooled by Sexton lol
Kevin Durant. James Harden. Kyrie Irving.... still not enough to stop Collin Sexton tonight.
"Kyrie ""Russel Westbrook"" Irving"
"Kyrie ""heroball"" Irving has arrived."
Kyrie Andrew Irving Irving.
"Kyrie does pull out a Kobe fade on occasion, but he doesn’t play exactly like either of them. AI was much more willing to take on contact, which Irving generally avoids. Kyrie also isn’t an off ball scorer like Kobe was towards the late 2000s. Kyrie plays like Kyrie. He uses elements from both of these players but is mostly his own entity."
kyrie irving almost game winner against twolves in brooklyn debut
"And using the first Google definition of hand eye coordination and warping it to your argument means nothing.  You’re either Kyrie Irving himself, a super Steph hater, or just plain dumb. I even said Kyrie has better handles, and yes there is a degree of hand eye involved there, not denying that, but hand eye is much more than that.   The crazy stuff we’ve seen Steph do, from knocking the water bottle from Dray’s hand, to the crazy high arcing shots, the blind 3’s, his ability to golf (which is inherently a way better test of hand eye than bball) just a step up from Irving. Kyrie is no doubt great in that regard too, and his handles and his blind layups prove it. You’re acting like I’m saying his hand eye is junk, it’s not, it’s probably in the 99.9999th percentil of the Earth, and I’m not taking away from that, Steph is just in the 100th percentile, a slight step up from Kyrie, but they’re both world class in that regard, Steph is just world class-ier. I’m not trying to take anything away from Kyrie but your argument is just your own confirmation bias and warping the wiki definition to fit it.   Steph has the ability to process distance and how much power he needs to use with his hands based on his distance and angle from the hoop, and uses his hand eye to determine exactly how to make shots from 4, 24, or 40 feet, being the best shooter in history relies on an unprecedented, never before seen, level of HEC. The stuff Kyrie does also requires HEC, again I’m not saying it doesn’t, but it’s just not quite as impressive as what we’ve seen Steph do time and time and time and time and time and time again."
"He is now off of Golden State, making history coming back at nearly the same level after an Achilles tear and has Kyrie Irving and James Harden taking the heat."
"Lmao what the hell  You’d go with KD who’s team has the 9th best record in the league, who’s missed 10/27 games this season and who has Kyrie Irving and James Harden as teammates one of whom is having a career best year right now"
"kyrie irving? like, I get your self depreciation but is it making you forget that the cubbard wasn't exactly empty in Cleveland.  not to mention other lottery wins (no matter how squandered).  there was appeal there, even outside of whatever sense of obligation James felt.  just to throw some homerism in there, compare it to a place like Charlotte, which until very recently is a free agent wasteland.  what vet looking to go over the top will take a pay cut to sign into the freaking bobcats? Kemba was able to get a cast off supposed washed up Al Jefferson, but that's still a signing. To say Cleveland has had none, which was the statement I was originally responding to, is incorrect."
Finally a response that is grounded in reality. I bet Kyrie Irving was mad at that.
Why should it preclude you? Should Tobias Harris get in over Kyrie Irving just because the Sixers have a better record than the Nets even though Kyrie is a way better player than Tobias? Why not just call it the Best Record Game instead other All Star Game at that point? The All Star Game is for the best players in the league.
Kyrie Andrew Irving  Also just a way of saying KY
His dribbling is extremely tight. Sure maybe not Kyrie Irving god tier levels of tight but he’s still one of the best dribblers in the league.

I am the gatekeeper of NBA truth and Jamal Murray played 19 games better than Kyrie Irving.  Bow to my superior wisdom you filthy peasant!
Playoff Jamal Murray is better than Kyrie Irving  Regular season Jamal Murray however...  I don't know if Coach Malone forgets he's there or something?
"Proving your point lmaoo. You have no point. Your point is ""you're projecting"". That's not a point. That's just something people say when they have no counter.   You said Michael Jordan avoids contact and your example was a video where he jumps right in the middle of 2 defenders?? You said Lebron has more touch, dexterity, and finesse than Derrick Rose?? The fact that you still havent mentioned Kyrie Irving is just embarrassing. Steve Nash, hello? You just dont know basketball. You're a typical Warriors bandwagon fan."

Kyrie Irving and The Flat Earth Crew
"It would be funny to see him asking for touches in the post in a team with Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving."
"&gt; easily all-NBA third team  I'm not saying he won't make it, but between the likes of Steph Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Damian Lilliard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, and Devin Booker there's *a lot* of competition (and no doubt there will still be names that others will be throwing out there). Definitely wouldn't call him *easily* 3rd team."

*Kyrie Irving has entered the chat.*
"Again, I'm not quite clear on this analysis.  Them playing basketball for money requires the league itself to make money.  Is that a problem with the system?  So no games, no revenue (well minimal revenue, but certainly not enough to support player salaries at current levels).      They are innately aware their bodies are commodities, but why is that disgusting?  They get paid because of their physical skills.  Fans watch because of the demonstration of those skills.  Is the disgust with an economic system that involves physical labor?  Probably a lot of players would have wanted to opt out, but in what system would it be the case that they wouldn't need to balance that need with the knowledge that they have a finite playing career?  Also, how are we defining ""need to survive""?  Are we defining ""survive"" as: making enough money to let you live comfortably for the rest of your life by the time your body declines where you can't play at an NBA level?  What economic system is going to give you that?  Also I don't understand what you're talking about when saying ""having needs met.""  This seems especially odd if we're talking about the ASG.  If Kyrie Irving didn't play this season and opted out, would he be at risk of not having his needs met if he didn't receive a salary?     It just seems you are making criticisms of the economic system (at least in the U.S.) that may apply in a lot of instances but don't make any sense to me in the context of the NBA."
I would have put jaylen brown over kyrie irving since kyrie has missed a lot of games
You are just like Kyrie Irving. Amazing handle.  😂
"Surely, a team involving Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden don't *need* Joe Harris to win. If that's the case, then they're not winning it."

"He's putting up more shots than any time in the last 5 years. He is not ""sharing the ball"" anymore than he used to.  The fact of the matter is that if they are putting up the same stats, Curry is better. It is objectively easier to score with James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Joe Harris spacing the floor than anyone on the Warriors roster."
"His ex-teammate Kyrie Irving said as much when he said KD is the first player he's played with that he could trust in the clutch, that was this year."
"Collin Sexton, Nets pick, dad dicks Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving into oblivion and then does it again a day later for fun"

"I think some situations are different. The Nets are an interesting example cause the third option is Kyrie Irving. But, sometimes that third option is only having an ""all star year"" cause of option shots from the first two."
I like Kyrie Irving. As a player and as a genuinely good weird dude. The league is better for having him.  That said he can be annoying
You can get really good at something if you practice it enough. Kyrie Irving- professional basketball player and professional victim.
I can’t believe he left to play with Kyrie Irving...

Last time he said similar shit he turned into Kyrie “6-22” Irving.
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."

Kyrie Irving is not articulate. He has a larger speaking vocabulary than most people and he utilizes it very poorly.
I feel like he should be the ambassador for the nba players committee.  They got to stop giving attention to people like Kyrie Irving who seems to always have this glazed over look on his face.  I would prefer Dame over people like Lebron or any of the other idiots.
He'd be Kyrie Irving but even more of an offensive threat
"We have seen superstars say they are happy n then leave, not a great example but kyrie irving.."
Kyrie Irving with his attitude should 100% stay active in the NBA to provide entertainment to us on and off the court
"Kyrie irving. I'd have maximum leverage cuz whenever I didn't like a decision my team made, I could threaten them with some stupid shit and no one would bat an eyelid. Then I could retire at 30 with a couple hundred million and it wouldn't even surprise people."
Jaylen Brown is a better player than Kyrie I can really score but that's about all I bring Irving.
"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
I can't believe KYRIE IRVING said this.
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24.

I hate Kyrie Irving. Self entitled prick
"Fuck that and fuck Kyrie Irving.  League would be better off without him in the long run, despite his talent."
He’s not absolutely horrendous. He’s pretty average to good in most areas. But y’all said Kyrie Irving should retire a few weeks ago so why argue..
There goes Kyrie Irving taking way too many shots. Twice the number of shots as Harden and only 3 more points.
"Kyrie Irving, starring in the new reality tv show, The Underdogs: How the Brooklyn Nets so Many Odds."
"Kyrie is having a career year, offensively is Harden the one who has taken the role of facilitator so I see Irving as the second option but oh well what do I know"
&gt;Jesus fans online are annoying nowadays. People have to stop making everything championship or bust.  Do you think having james harden. Kyrie irving. And kevin durant in one team is a factor or is it completely manufactured by annoying fans

I don’t think the goal was to have all 3 of em play together almost every minute Bc that wouldn’t work. It’s knowing you can take Kyrie Irving out and still have James Harden and KD in is what benefits them
"I feel like you read the title of the post only.   The Nets thus far are scoring 8 more points a game with 2 of Harden/Durant/Irving in the lineup versus when they ALL are in the lineup. Wouldnt you agree that they expect better offensive output when they all play given that they traded away defense and depth to get it?   So my question is, do you think eventually we will see signs that the Nets made the right decision to keep Kyrie? Is it just a matter of time? Could it not even happen in year 1 even? Or will it be different in 20 games."
Harden is on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"Jamal ""Kyrie Irving"" Murray"
"I never said it wasn't a foul. I just watch James Harden, Kyrie Irving and a million other guards do it every night without a call."
But with 100% less Kyrie Irving making for a 1000000000% more likable crew.
"I mean, he's traded for KG, Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving, and IT, among other deals he's made (Crowder, Jeff Green when people still thought he was good, then shipping Jeff Green for a pick), and without a doubt his best moves (other than maybe KG) were holding on to the Nets picks and taking Tatum and Brown. This has nothing to do with Ainge leaking information, other people are saying Ainge is trying to make a move. How can you fault Ainge if it doesn't happen here? It's not like he's putting this out"
Super team really is a lost word nowadays huh lol. The corpse of Dwyane wade and Kyrie Irving are not superteams.
"""Or"" isn't enough.    Over the past 5 years, Danny brought in:  Isaiah Thomas + Al Horford + Gordon Hayward + Kyrie Irving + Kemba Walker + Jayson Tatum + (soon to be All-Star) Jaylen Brown.   If ""or"" was enough then people would already be satisfied. Danny fell short because he didn't bring in all those guys ""and"" more.  You have to get every single All-Star in the NBA or you are a failure."
How much does Kyrie Irving make 😂
And also Kyrie Irving
"Kyrie ""smeghead"" Irving"
Fun fact: Stephen A Smith and Kyrie Irving have both had exactly equal basketball impact for the Brooklyn Nets over the past few games.
"[/u/inshamblesx] Right now [Kyrie Irving] can't play better than me. You know why? Because both of us are not on the court. He's somewhere else other than the Barclays Center. I'm on /r/nba shittalking. He ain't doing anything on the court that I ain't doing, because neither of us are there."
Stfu old head not everyone needs to explain themselves to you and definitely not kyrie Irving who is a champ . He doesn’t have to disclose where he is to anyone if it’s personal it’s personal . I’m sure if u Stop getting caught up in another mans problems and put that energy into ur own life you’ll be better than where ur at right now . It sounds like ur old so it’s probably too late for u to make a positive impact on ur life.

"Jackie MacMullan on Kyrie Irving: ""This guy is an idiot"""
"I think much of it had to do with the erratic behavior of Kyrie. This is now an experiment...if they can get these three to gel, then you have a powerful tandem (rebounding and defending role players/sixth men - are much easier to find than stars, plus some in house guys like Shamet should step up with more minutes played)...if it doesn't work out you can easily get role players and picks back for Irving, and still keep a top tier player next to Durant."
Kyrie Irving is the player character. We’re all just NPCs
"Where tf is Kyrie Irving, I be looking on all night, searching on my computer"
"They'll be on TV, seen from the bench. A rookie who doesn't play is not going to get huge endorsement money.  Very few rookies are good enough to make the rotation of a contending team, and if they are, they are good enough to get a huge contract somewhere else AND endorsement money regardless of where they end up. Kyrie and LeBron had plenty of endorsements in Cleveland.  Do you know who the top 10 endorsement earners in the NBA are?  LeBron, Curry, Durant, Giannis, Westbrook, Zion, Harden, Irving, Lillard, Thompson.  &gt; The attraction of large media markets for free agents is a common point made by talking heads in sports media, as large markets presumably open doors for athletes to earn more endorsement opportunities.  &gt; However, three of the NBA’s top 10 endorsement earners — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, and Damian Lillard — all currently play in small-to-medium NBA markets. Additionally, Russell Westbrook had spent his career in Oklahoma City, the NBA’s smallest market, prior to joining the Houston Rockets this season.   &gt; While massive media markets may offer an advantage for off-court earning potential, this list shows that on-court success and personal brand building impact player endorsement value far more than the size of their market alone.   https://opendorse.com/blog/nba-top-10-endorsement-earners/  Zion would've got a near max equivalent and huge endorsements no matter where he went, he is not signing a minimum to ring chase as a 20 year old.  The idea that players go to New York or LA and immediately get big endorsements is based on pre-internet logic where you could only watch players on local tv. Knicks are the biggest market and have no players on that list. The only NY/LA players there were already superstars before joining. Giannis is doing just fine."
"""Wow. Wish I could gain 100 lbs in the off season, fuck around at strip clubs, and throw temper tantrums then get teammates like Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. That's easy. Being a good teammate and staying in a small market. That takes skill."""
Even more interesting is that this is being reported by NESN aka New England Sports Network. Surely they wouldn’t have any existing biases against Kyrie Irving.
"Kyrie Irving gets paid millions of dollars to work out, show up, and play basketball for the Nets. He is a literal millionaire and can do whatever he wants to do.   Having stipulations in contracts that you cannot be employed by anyone else while you are under contract is not inhumane. It's an agreement to work for someone."
Kyrie Irving seems like a Champagne Socialist
"Kyrie had him coming to Cleveland before Lebron decided to come home.  He had another guy too, but i can't find or remember who it was.    https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/david-griffin-kyrie-irving-had-gordon-hayward-committed-cavs-lebron-signed"
I'm not betting on any team with Kyrie Irving.
"This is beyond the warriors super team.  Sorry, but KD is not going to have a legacy.  Yes he’s an incredible scorer, yes he’s a champion, yes he’s one of the most talented players in the league today.   But when has he shown that he is a die hard competitor? When has he shown that he can overcome insane obstacles to win? When has he shown that he can do it on his own?  He hasn’t.  He left the Thunder for the team that BEAT HIM IN GAME SEVEN. And then he left them to “win on his own” which he wasn’t even because Kyrie Irving was there. The two of them were a perfect match, both of them left franchises that loved them, made claims that they had to prove themselves on their own, and now BOTH will be backup singers to James Harden’s headliner.  The league loves Durant now. Give it time. I personally predict and guarantee that he will never be discussed in any GOAT conversations and will be forgotten long term."

Kyrie “MLK” Irving
Breaking News: Kyrie Irving says he'll play now
You seriously think Wesley Mathews and Schroeder are stopping Kyrie Irving and James Harden? You can’t be serious. I’ve seen those guys put big numbers on Draymond and Klay in their prime. Trust me when they get going is futile.
"I’m Tired of people saying that they can’t blend because kyrie won’t be a third option...  first of all, he doesn’t have to be third option he’s Kyrie  f***ing Irving. He can score whenever he wants, where ever he wants, in any way he wants, efficiently.   He shoots almost 50/40/90 every year,  he’s a career 39% 3 point shooter which is better than KD and Harden, he can cut,catch and shoot, and pass very well as he showed in Boston.   You can’t double team any of these 3 lethal scorers who can score at all three levels. 3 guys who can put up 50 any night off of isolation. If things fall into place they have a good shot at the Lakers this year, and they can add defensive pieces in the off-season to make them title favorite every year.   For all 48 minutes , KD, Kyrie and/ or Harden will be on the floor. 1,2, or 3 superstar players will be on the floor the entire game! We’ve never seen something like this!"
"This is going to be so interesting to watch. Or unfold, or unravel.  I agree that it's for Kyrie to break it or make it. If he plays, it should be provide some of the craziest offense we've seen. They could be terribly unbalanced in defense, though. But if they gel right, they could be most amazing.  Call me a realist, or pessimist, but I can't see KD-Harden-Irving working ego-wise. Especially if Irving is prone to taking off.  For me, the big question mark for the Nets before the season was the defense. How well could they defend against the likes of Giannis? What made the teams that beat the Bucks in the past so great is that they ran a tight ship defensively, exposing Giannis's lack of a jump shot or 3-pointer. But is there enough defense in this Nets team to shut the likes of him down?  And when push comes to shove, how much can we expect the big offensive gurus they now have to play defense in a tight spot? How much do they want the ball in their hands in the expense of team strategy and chemistry?  Time will tell. But it sure is going to be interesting. Here's hoping that COVID doesn't completely mess this season up since there's so much going on."
"Kyrie Irving wants total freedom and money too.  He doesn't understand that by accepting money and a multi-year contract, he must respect the team that pays him.  If he wants total freedom, he must assume the risks that go with it and sign one-year contracts every time."
Kyrie Irving

"I don’t even fully believe Kyrie Irving is going to be playing basketball by the playoffs, let alone playing solid D lol"
"Kyrie Irving is a beautiful man, an old soul whose vibrations are in tune with those of Gaia. He is benevolent, enlightened and compassionate. Basketball is a way for him to gain a platform that he can use to pass on his message to his devout followers. His vision is so great that he can see along the curvature of the earth farther than normal eyes, and so the sun goes down later for Kyrie. He also has 4 colour cones in his eyes, therefore allowing him to see beyond the typical RGB palette."
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kyrie Irving. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kyrie's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance..."
Steve Nash coaching Kyrie Irving is either going to lead to the greatest attitude and gameplay turnaround in history or this is gonna explode with much lol

"LeBron played all of his entire contract on all teams. Him being a FA and going to different teams was just a complete overreaction by people since he’s LeBron. It shouldn’t be news that a guy who has played for 17-18 seasons has been on 3 teams (4 if you separate the early Cavs stint &amp; later Cavs stint).  KD (14 years played) played his entire contract with the Thunder &amp; Warriors and then went to Brooklyn to play with Kyrie in FA. The crazy part was who he chose when he went to the Warriors, not that he left. BKN is his 3rd team.  Kawhi (10 years played) had a year left with the Spurs and they traded him to the Raptors. He’s with the team most (if not everyone) projected him to be with that whole season. He’s expected to come back on a max deal in the summer. That’s his 3rd team.  George (11 years played) asked for a trade from the Pacers and got shipped to OKC. Presti made an agreement with PG if he ever wanted to be traded to just tell him. He did that and went to the Clippers and just re-upped on a deal. 3rd team for PG.  Butler (10 years played) wanted Miami from the jump and two other teams traded for him in between that time. He then did a sign and trade to go to Miami. 4th team (which is the most on this list at the time of reaching that trade as a star)  Kyrie (10 years played) asked for a trade from the Cavs once he knew LeBron was out. Him backing out on the Celtics was crazy I give you that. 3rd team still.  CP3 (16 years played) did a sign and trade with Houston after opting out with the Clippers. At the time his 3rd team.  Westbrook (13 years played) got traded by the Thunder and then asked for a trade from the Rockets when Morey stepped down &amp; MDA got canned. 2nd team on the Rockets, 3rd team overall with the Wizards.  And finally Harden (12 years played) asked for a trade after Morey stepped down &amp; MDA got canned. 2nd team. Oladipo was literally in trade talks for almost a year now by the Pacers. 4th team but the 1st time he gets traded as a star.  The only crazy situation was Kyrie and Boston. Everything else was extreme overreaction and people being dramatic. Guys letting teams get value for them after saying they’re not going to re-up isn’t crazy. Players going to a different team in FA isn’t crazy. People did the same thing about the Clippers last year and are now quiet because we all accept the fact him and Kawhi are going to be there for some years. These dudes have played for over 10 years and people go crazy when they say “I think it’s time to leave this team”.  Harden, Irving &amp; Durant having their own team that’s going to follow them during the twilight of their careers is probably the last stop. It’s nothing crazy about that. Only insane people with no sense didn’t see Harden’s trade request coming after Morey stepped down &amp; MDA got canned."
Kyrie Irving definitely could win Finals MVP. Iguodala and Maxwell have FMVPs lol
They barely have Kyrie Irving
You kinda sound like Kyrie Irving.
But he called himself Kai Irving...  Kyrie andrew irving Irving
Might be nice to do something in your life other than hating on Kyrie Irving.
"Van Basten was the best player of the 80s and won more both at club level and individually, Ronaldinho was one of the most fun to watch players of all time, but he isnt even close to the top 10 and I dont really care about if youre talking about Kyrie Irving or not, you said Ronaldinho couldve been the best of all time, I said there were players better than him, that also had more potential than him"

Wait Kyrie Irving?  from the Cavs championship &amp; then got traded to Boston?  What team does he play for now?  I swear I remember injuries derailed his career.  He played for Duke I believe

"Collin Sexton was traded for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry when he was 14, and again for Kyrie Irving when he was 18 before he’d even got to the league. Imagine telling a 14 year old Collin Sexton in his freshman year of high school that he’d be traded for 2 future HOFers, and the NBA ROTY from 2 years ago who just made his first All Star game."
Fuck No Fuck No Fuck. No. Idk when you started watching nba but idk what the fuck you think kyrie Irving has done that makes him better or more valueable than Klay Thompson
"“In 2020-1, Irving will earn a base salary of $33,329,100 and a incentive bonus of $131,250, while carrying a cap hit of $33,460,350 and a dead cap value of $33,329,100” [source ](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/kyrie-irving-8051/)"
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
Why does everybody think the nets are going to be world beaters because of the three pieces they have?  Is Kyrie Irving even going to show up again? He's going to go into a moody funk right before the playoffs and sink them in the first round?
Does it account for Kyrie Irving mid-season awol mental holiday?
Yes. Embarrassing takes in the thread I made a month ago. The Lakers and Bucks were bad value at the time like I said. The Brooklyn Nets are winning the championship if Kyrie Irving decides to play and no injuries.
"&gt;when Kyrie KD and Harden are playing 40 minutes  Durant hasn't averaged 40 minutes in the playoffs since 2016.  Harden hasn't done it since 2014.  Irving exceeded 35 once and just barely, in 2015.  Obviously, all were much younger then.  If that's your plan, it may need some adjustment."
That Kyrie Irving isn't who he thinks he is
"*Enters Kyrie Irving*  “I’m back guys, what did I miss?”"
Kyrie “Tracy “Tracy Morgan” Jordan” Irving
"Kyrie ""I'm never going 8-22 again... and immediately goes 7-22"" Irving   and Kevin ""blew a 3-1 lead and then immediately fled to the team that just beat me"" Durant  Those the 2 guys you're saying who never had any memorable playoff choke jobs...?"
If they trade the Ghost of Kyrie Irving? Sure.
"The Nets now have arguably the highest ceiling of any team I've seen outside of the Warriors. Even then it's arguable.   James Harden is one of the best scorers and playmakers in NBA history who plays at his best with marksmen on his team and a secondary ball handler to pull some of the scoring and passing load off of him.   Kyrie Irving is (IMO) not a first option for anyone but is one of the best backup guards ever, we saw this in Cleveland when he played behind Bron. His ability to slot in behind another expert scorer and passer let's his iso gifts shine bright.  Kevin Durant is the best scorer ever, hands down. He doesn't like the spotlight and like we saw in Golden State is a fucking savant when you need a bucket from anywhere on the floor. Give him two solid playmakers and two legitimate offensive threats to share the load? We might see the best version of KD.  Imagine a KD/Kyrie PnR with Harden sitting in the corner. How the fuck do you even defend that? Either Kyrie eats his man's lunch, Durant picks his shot in the post or Harden lines up a three. If you don't want them in the floor together? That's fine, you have three of the best ISO scorers ever. Stagger them out so every six minutes one goes in and one comes off. Run Harden/KD while Kyrie rests, then Harden/Kyrie, then Kyrie/KD. Those are three of the top 7 1/2 punches in the NBA today and all three of them thrive on picking apart defenses and setting up a perfect shot.  Now that said, they have the lowest floor of any super team I can possibly imagine. If they play poorly or don't mesh they won't just kill the team they may well kill the franchise. The Nets don't have their own pick for close to a decade and they have no money. They're all in on this trio and they are three of the most volatile personalities in the NBA. Harden might go strip club crazy again, Durant might feel iced out and walk, Kyrie might... Kyrie it up."
They all talking about a super team nope the nets just blew their team up by bringing in another cancer. Bad enough they have kyrie Irving insane ass on the team now the have the ultimate ball hawk. Not gonna matter much having one of the best players in the league in KD when he will never see the ball again.
DeAndre Jordan for Serge Ibaka. Spencer Dinwiddie and Kyrie Irving for Wendall Carter? Kristaps Porzingis. Jarret Allen.  I think WSC is Wendall Carter. None of this shit is realistic.
"Kyrie Irving is no Steph Curry. Curry is the must unselfish player in the NBA and brings no drama. Kyrie and Harden together should be fun and the media is really happy now because their is all this potential for drama, KD is still the leader of this team."
"I need to mature because I don't care about Kyrie's mother? Hardly. I doubt he cares about my mother. I doubt you care about my friends. I doubt Bill down the road cares about how some random person in Mississippi is doing. That's not a case for maturity. And nowhere did I once say basketball was more important than someone's life (ironically, Kyrie doesn't seem to put much stock into basketball or life, be it his or others, seeing as how he's fine with partying during Covid).   But if you want to talk maturity, let's discuss the man who you have decided to martyr yourself for.  Is it *mature* to refuse to do your job? Is it *mature* to quit on those around you who should be able to rely on you to carry through with your responsibilities? Is it *mature* to skip work in order to party and hang out with tons of people in the middle of a pandemic that has killed millions of people, completely disregarding all safety and health protocol put in place? Or maybe it's *mature* to speak to people as if they're below you, and to spread scientific lies to the masses, many of which are young children who idolize people in his position.   You want to talk about immaturity, look in the mirror and ask yourself, is Kyrie Irving, Mr. The Earth is Flat, I'm so Woke, You're all just Pawns, is he *really* the person you should be defending right now?  If you've answered yes, I can only assume that you are A) Trolling, which is my initial belief, B) stupid, or C) a child yourself who drank the Kyrie Kool aid. If it's A, then whatever, good for you. If it's B, then not much can be done about that. Stay in school. If it's C, I truly, truly hope that as you get older, you realize that Kyrie is about the furthest thing removed from a role model that you should have."

This is assuming Kyrie Irving doesn't run off to an island and join a cult.
Noo..  It's James Harden dude.  Not to mention they also have Kevin Durant.  And Kyrie Irving. Or maybe. I'm not too sure about Irving. He might've signed with a religious group or something
"Ppl seriously complaining about the bench. They have fucking James Harden, Kevin Durant AND Kyrie Irving AND Joe Harris, Shamet is servicable as well, what do they want that bench to do?"
"They're going to trade Kyrie Irving and the rest of their roster (except Durant) to Washington in exchange for Westbrook, sending out a 3-man-lineup Durant, Westbrook and Harden."
"Brooklyn trades Kyrie Irving and the rest of their roster (except Durant) to Washington in exchange for Westbrook, sending out a 3-man-lineup Durant, Westbrook and Harden."
"I feel it's really unfair to Harden to refer to him as a 'headcase' in the same sentance has Kyrie Irving. If you feel that Harden is problematic because of the way he acted this year, then AD, Kawhi, Butler, KD are all problematic players in your opinion too.   And I mean, outside of him saying he feels like the rockets are not that good this year, which is true, he hasn't really been a problem for his teamates imo. Showed up to play once the season started, and looks like the same old Harden that we are used to see play.   I feel like because people don't like his playstyle, they are way harder on him than most other superstars. In terms of a superstar wanting a trade, he did more or less the same way we've seen other superstars go about it the last few years."
"""Art is life.  Ball is art.  Therefore through the substitution property of equality, one of the eight properties of equality, if x = y, then x can be substituted in for y in any equation, and y can be substituted for x in any equation. If you put in these terms, such as, ball is life, so on and so forth.""  Kyrie Irving - Your favorite intellectual intellectual."
The great thing about this trade for the nets is they get to see if Harden Durant and Irving can coexist and if the team composition is gonna work and if it doesn't they can trade Kyrie later for something more complimentary or bring some depth back to the roster.
thats ironic because the first kyrie irving trade was cavs-celtics. both contenders in the east at the time.
"Lol Nets go all in a decade ago on aging vets beyond their prime. They go bust, and cause their franchise permanent damage while becoming the laughing stock of the NBA.  Did they learn their lesson? Nope.  This time going all in on an aging superstar who doesn't play defense, to go along with one of the softest minds in the game in Kyrie.  This is just history repeating itself again.  The nets will spend the next 2-3 years delaying the inevitable through a sunk cost fallacy. At which point, they'll have to blow it up with no 1st round draft picks beyond the bones thrown to them for the remains of KD, Harden and Irving just like they did with Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce."
"I just can't fathom how this man still has any defenders.  ""*But he's obviously suffering from mental illness*"" Or he's just a prick. Until there is some confirmation on that, he's just an asshole. There are people with confirmed mental illnesses that get less support, less leeway, and make significantly less money that manage to get by in life while holding jobs and maintaining healthy relationships. He's a diva who thinks he's the smartest guy in the room at all times, and generally the people who make that thought known are nothing but narcissistic idiots.  ""*But he's so good at basketball!*"" Yeah, but not when he isn't showing up and quits on his team. Every team he's ever been on. And it's not like he's the best. It isn't like this is some Michael Jordan/LeBron James level player who is actually must see TV and can actually lead a team of scrubs to a finals. He's great, he's not irreplaceable.  ""*But he still does a lot of good with his money and attempts to bring light to bigger issues than basketball.*"" You can do that without being an irredeemable piece of shit. For every good deed he's fine, there are dozens of stories of him acting like a jackass, spreading scientific falsehoods, and treating people he views as beneath him like dirt.  ""*I just still like him because of how clutch he was for the Cavs ring.*"" That goodwill has far run out. Yeah, he was a big piece of it, and he subsequently forced his way out of Cleveland because he felt disrespected. He then goes and sabotages every single team he has since played on.  Fuck Kyrie Irving. He's a piece of shit, and anybody that still actually tries to defend him is as fucking delusional as Trump supporters. He doesn't give a fuck about anybody but himself, which is made abundantly clear by the fact that he's abandoned another team to go party during a goddamn global pandemic. If the NBA has any sense of moral standards, he needs to be suspended for the season, and if I was one of his co-workers, I would be enraged and embarrassed that his man represents my team, my sports, my anything."
"&gt;The claim that the refs did not read the rules at all is both arrogantly presumptuous and relies on when and how Kyrie touched the ball with respect to Randle's position.  It may be arrogant, but it's not presumptuous and not wrong.  Nor is it unique, since there was another case last week or so when the NBA's official statement on a call contradicted their own rules.  This happens more often than not, to be honest.  Furthermore, the NBA's statement did not address the rule section I quoted at all -- so if they were aware, they neglected to mention it.  The play as-described by the NBA is a held ball, since they explicitly said Irving touched the ball, but Randle maintained continuous possession.  In order to call something else, they need to explain why that's not the call.  &gt;Perhaps you would make a great ref yourself, considering how well versed you are in the rulebook and how carefully you are able to look at screenshots of plays  I would, and have, thanks.  If nothing else, I would at least read the relevant rules before making an official explanation -- something that clearly did not happen in this case."
"That’s ridiculous, he touched the ball not his hand. He could’ve got into a better position to get a shot off but didn’t. Good D from Kyrie Irving."
Kyrie Irving wanted to be the reason no one else wore 11. 2 people have in the next 2 seasons. Pritchard ROY
Two ferraris racing against each other make themselves both seem slow. Kyrie Irving is the Ferrari and your street ball guys are Acura Integras.

"Hold on now. Just imagine you are at an inner city park playing ball. You are in some diverse neighborhood and one of your boys works for Pepsi and brougjt a few cases.  Now also imagine that there is something being filmed there. You don't know what, but there are cameras facing the court. Maybe someone is making a mix tape? Maybe some scouts are looking for the next kyrie Irving? You don't know.  Now giving all of these things, wouldn't you also make sure that your Pepsi label was facing the camera? You know, just in case?"
"No, that’s just how we roll.   Now if you’ll excuse me, my black friend, my Asian friend and I would like to drink some delicious, ice cold Pepsi while enjoying the comic stylings of Kyrie Andrew Irving."
"It was a tavel, [but so was what Harden did earlier in the game](https://twitter.com/PhilipDamiano/status/1371656606287601668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1371656606287601668%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fftw.usatoday.com%2Flists%2Fknicks-vs-nets-julius-randle-kyrie-irving-travel).     And it has nothing to do with whether player lost control of the ball. If you watch the Harden play, Scott foster does not signal that the ball came loose (both palms facing up, arms alternating moving up and down), he signals that contact was made with the ball (both palms facing either other).      He admitted there was contact with the ball on the Randle travel, so he just changed his interpretation of the rule during the game.      Again, if his thought process is ""the ball was dislodged on the Harden play"" he would have signaled that the ball was dislodged, not that contact was made with the ball."
"I only speak for myself but I'm not disappointed because it affects me *personally*. I'm disappointed because it affects the world we live in when celebrities with huge amounts of influence, especially on impressionable kids, so casually spread misinformation on topics they know nothing about.

"In the modern era you DO need to be a genius and say exactly what you mean. Everyone holds each other to those standards now - which are obviously unattainbale. Or else people like you come online and destroy them, misinterpret their context, and refuse to see any other theoretical explanation except their own as a possibility. People have latched onto this years later and never listened to the original video. They have, instead, watched everything Kyrie has done since then and reinforced their own views.     I personally understand why Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Lebron fucking James, and Kyrie Irving - during their championship run / the year after - might be having a candid conversation about how the media warps the truth or ""decides"" for us.      Again, it's obvious his ""flat earth"" example was stupid and ruined his point. But how can you say an NBA basketball player can't have an opinion on journalists/media? Just because his example was bad? Just because he isn't up to your standard? Is JR Smith or Kyle Kuzma (random examples) not allowed to talk about the media either simple because they aren't college educated on the subject?      Why do we have any more reason to be here talking about it? Is it because we aren't in front of cameras and microphones? I would argue Kyrie shouldn't need to ""keep it behind closed doors"". He tried to have a philosophical conversation and it backfired; reinforcing his own world view that the media and people can't be trusted.      Our society NEEDS to have a real conversation about how social media, journalists, and news control our behaviours while making us too lazy to search topics ourselves.      Seriously, sometimes I think Journalism is the 4th branch of government; it holds that much power. Yet it has barely any regulation in fear of hurting freedom of speech.     Kyrie tried to talk about stuff like this and misspoke. But then again, I'm sure I did too. And so did you. I personally stay off twitter in fear of doing so. It doesn't suddenly mean we can't talk about it. Just that what people truly mean when we speak day-to-day isn't always 100% perfection - and the media needs to come to terms with that, critically think, ask more questions, and find out what people truly mean. Including you.     If you actually did read all of this I must say you are more friend than foe!"

comparing steph curry to kyrie irving and anthony davis is laughable imo
"I mean, its clearly a travel/up and down. Kyrie grazes the ball while randle is still on ground, randle maintains possession, jumps, and then lands still with the ball. He then proceeds to throw a temper tantrum and knock over a chair. Knick fans should be more angry with randle getting clamped by Kyrie Irving in the clutch than with the officiating. Even with end game fouling, they still shot more FTs than a Nets team with two of the best players at drawing fouls. Refs even correctly called the 2 jump balls at the end of the game in favor of the Knicks; most refs just immediately call a foul. Was an awesome game, Knicks showed a ton of heart coming back from 18 down. Its a shame their effort will get overshadowed by whining about referees"
"He absolutely cannot be the 2nd star on a title team. A 2nd star on a title team is a Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Steph Curry, ... not a Paul George."
"NBA's headline right now ""**Nets hold off Knicks' late push to win 5th straight**: Kyrie Irving scores 34 and James Harden gets a triple-double as red-hot Brooklyn survives New York's rally."" It's all about the narrative now"
"I think people tend to let their opinion of Kyrie Irving the person effect their opinion of Kyrie Irving the player.   But yes, he’s definitely bordering on top 10 in the league when he’s on. Only thing is that he can be a little hot and cold but he’s starting to remove that from his game as he gets older and more experienced."
2012: Superteam to beat a bunch of literal children  2013: Bailed out by Ray Allen  2016: Bailed out by Kyrie Irving  2020: LeMickey ring  Yeah this one checks out
Kyrie Irving the chosen people of the refs
"The Knicks are fun to watch, but [Kyrie Irving](https://imgur.com/a/EXCUk01) and the Nets are just too good. Imagine when KD comes back, damn."
Kyrie Irving is 100% a superstar.
When coaches game plan do they say “okay guys today our game plan is to stop James harden!” No. They say “okay our game plan is going to be trying to stop James harden Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving.”  Edit: and harder shots?? That’s just straight false
 Watching **Kyrie** Irving play basketball is a blessing
"It's not like he's always playing on a stacked team, Kevin Durant has missed more games than he's played and Kyrie Irving missed a little over 1/4 of the Nets' games.  He definitely has an easier situation, but he's still been the biggest driving force in the Nets' success."
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
"That’s not Kyrie Irving, that’s Barmelo Xanthony."
lol fr. apparently the difference of the 2016 Warriors being the undisputed greatest team ever and just historically great regular season team is a Kyrie Irving stepback 3

Kyrie Irving only played 11 games in college as well.  The talent for both guys was pretty clear even before joining the NBA.
"Of course, because I bet that JR Smith or Kyrie Irving knew the long term effects of all the other vaccines that they took and what they contained 🙄"
Kyrie Irving if things go south in Brooklyn and he wants out  but realistically its probably someone like Fred Van Vleet
I personally don’t think Paul will get the nod over Kyrie. Irving is capable of getting 2nd team in all honesty.
I don’t know who’s more incoherent Draymond Green or Kyrie Irving
"&gt;  I didn't even call you unsophisticated, only people who just want to flat out compare numbers.  Fair enough.  It seemed like you were making that implication, but if you're not I appreciate the clarification.  &gt;  Also idk what you consider prime Ray Allen, Bucks or Celtics. It's true I didn't watch him on the Bucks, but on the Celtics, he wasn't being double teamed regularly.  None of his years with the Celtics were close.  His years with the Sonics were much, much better, although the end of his Bucks tenure was solid (minus when he basically got replaced by Michael Redd).  &gt;  Also wtf, you claim Lillard has McCollum to prevent him from being double teamed? I think you are the one who does watch Lillard enough. Even with a healthy McCollum Lillard still gets double teamed on most plays. Go watch any series against where the Warriors beat the Blazers.  I can flat out promise you I've watched more Lillard than you have.  I was a few years above him on the same AAU squad, I watched him dominate from very young all the way through Alameda and have been a huge fan of his for his entire career.  The Warriors almost never double teamed Lillard.  Zone trap is not the same as double team, and Lillard purposefully drove into extra defenders so he could move the ball and work the 4v3.  Lillard purposefully driving into an occupied area of a zone to force more defenders on him and make a teammate open is not the same as shooting against a double team.  Lillard is almost always guarded by Klay 1v1 when they play the Warriors.  &gt;  Also I am a Blazers fan and a big fan of Dame, but this has nothing to do with that. Here is a list of players I also think are better shooters than Allen. Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, obviously Steph.  Dude....this is just bad.  Really bad.  Trae Young isn't even a top 10 shooter in the NBA right now.  Just because he has highlights hitting 35 footers doesn't mean he didn't miss 10 before he made that.  His shot selection is piss poor and his percentages are worse.  Not that that's the end all, and he is a talented player, but he's just not a very good shooter.  Damn the disrespect to an all time great here is savage.  Not one of those people besides Steph is a better shooter than Ray.  &gt;  I simply value the ability to create your own shot more than I value the ability to catch and shoot.  Then it might interest you to learn that Ray shot a better percentage on 3's he created than any of the people you listed in the last paragraph and Dame.  The fact that Ray Allen was shooting 40% regularly in an NBA that didn't value the 3 and would bench you for shooting off the dribble is insane.  Devaluing his accomplishments just because we're not qualifying them with context is a huge mistake."

"Oh not sure if you know, they also have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving"
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokić|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Dončić|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
&gt;He has an injured star demanding a Brinks truck on an expiring deal. He trades him for Kyrie Irving. You literally could not write a better outcome from the Celtics perspective.  How about having the star be healthy and using those assets on acquiring a 4th star instead of replacing a 3rd?
"I mean now we're just walking down a completely different road and I respectfully give up. Danny Ainge is not unlucky.  It's a matter of perspective. He has an injured star demanding a Brinks truck on an expiring deal. He trades him for Kyrie Irving. You literally could not write a better outcome from the Celtics perspective.  Any injury is ""unlucky"". To be able to trade him for a superstar and have a pro team not understand his condition, insofar as pausing the damn deal....very lucky.     Now re the injury.. look, I understand it very well, I'm an ER doc and familiar with the diagnosis specifically.  He grinded and dropped 25+ PPG on a labral tear for months until it was very symptomatic in the playoffs.   He was NOT diagnosed properly. He had a PRP groin injection in December for a ""groin strain"". He probably tore the labrum then. In March, KAT falls on him and he misses 2 games for a ""right knee bone bruise"". They either didn't know or didn't disclose, but I'm not accusing them of the latter. It's extremely common for this type of injury to be misdiagnosed as a groin injury.   It's not unreasonable to avoid surgery either, judging by his comments he didn't understand his injury very well, so I don't think he was bucking any recommendations. The Celtics also fired their trainer and strength coach at that time. Teams can say what they want, and we can choose to believe what we want..."
"Ok without going deep down the hypothetical road. You argument for him being unlucky is based on injuries.   What actually happened: The Celtics traded injured IT for Kyrie Irving (conveniently available premier PG) and even had to add a 2nd rounder when he fails the physical. Unlucky would be the trade failing bc of said degenerative hip condition. Unlucky would be the Cavs.  Yes, Hayward's injury was very unlucky but he spent 3 years on the Celtics and cost them nothing beyond the signing. Unlucky would've been trading a young star and picks for him.  Danny Ainge is not unlucky. At all."
James Harden isn’t playing better than LeBron.. AD had played 23 games.. KD had played 19. It’s not like there’s a big difference in games missed between the two... Are we ignoring the fact that James Harden’s second best player is Kyrie Irving? Or did he die when KD got hurt lol. You’re the one who sounds like a “casual” bud
"he was the youngest player in the Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson draft"
How the fuck can you win MVP in a season when 1. You publicly take a dump on your team and force them to trade you 2. You're playing on the same team as Kevin Durant AND Kyrie Irving  It's stupid.
"I see how they’re directly related but as previously stated I, along with all 30 nba GMs would do that deal again if we thought we had a chance in hell of keeping Kyrie. It’s not a bad trade, the bad part is we lost Kyrie. The trade for Kyrie isn’t bad, I would still do that again even if it meant possibly losing Kyrie for nothing while Sexton is balling in Cleveland because that’s how damn good Kyrie Irving is"
"#118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that’s the MVP.   I could even argue the reasoning for his offensive numbers being so good is due to his lack of impact/effort on D. Atleast with Embiid he was doing both offence and defence at a high level so I could see his case. But jokic has no REAL case hence why lebrons ahead of him in almost every MVP race right now except the one that ranks MVP standing on pure stats."
"LOL if I must.   #118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that’s the MVP."
They’d have two of the top three players in the series against every team plus Kyrie Irving. They don’t need a great defence to win.
"I mean it’s alright to be a realist and say they haven’t won a championship yet, but if that’s your description of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden immediately after, thats pretty disingenuous.   Good thing Embiid doesn’t have any injury or weight problems! Knockdown shooter in Ben, too."
"It’s Kyrie Irving hours out here now, crazy theories coming in hot"
"&gt; Multiple all-nba is exceeding expectations as a #1 pick.  Let's see how many #1 picks have 2 all-nba team selections or more.

"Stupid question. Yes, you have your lebrons and Ads but on the flip side you have your Michael Olowokandis and kwame browns. Kyrie Irving is doing just fine."
"You gotta give it up to Jokic too, 7 footer finishing like Kyrie Irving man. Absolutely amazing."
They'd have two of the three best players in the series against every team PLUS Kyrie Irving. Their defence might be trash but they have enough firepower to make up for it and then some. They're second in the East even with Kevin Durant missing half the season.

"&gt;There is no discussion that Kyrie Irving and Allen Iverson is comparable player. You are getting that response because you are writing something a little foolish and trying to turn it into a discussion.   Sure there is. We’re discussing it right now.   &gt;This would be similar to trying to have a discussion whether Rick Barry or Michael Jordan was better. The gap between their accomplishments are similarly big.  Sounds like you’re the one who started watching 5 years ago.  &gt;AI was a better scorer. A significantly better scorer, the stats and anyone who saw him play will tell you that.  Hey, this sounds like discussion to me!   Actually, the stats don’t say that at all. You should probably expand your opinion of “better scorer” besides “who has the highest ppg”.  Allen Iverson was pretty average efficiency wise relative to other high level scorers of his era. Don’t get me wrong, 31.1 ppg on 25.5 FGA is still very good all things considered, but it’s certainly not “significantly better” than anything Kyrie has done. Let’s compare their best scoring seasons.  Iverson: 31.1 on 51.8 TS% (league average was 52 TS%)  Kyrie: 27.7 ppg on 62.5 TS% (league average is 56.5)  Now, obviously you have to consider that Kyrie is playing with KD and Harden which bolsters his efficiency. But even if you want to hypothetically decrease Kyrie’s efficiency to account for his teammates, scoring at league average efficiency on the same volume is not out of the question for him at all.  Iverson and Kyrie are similar caliber scorers. Iverson just...took more shots out of necessity."

"On this day in 2015, Kyrie Irving scored a career-high and Cavs record 57 points in a win over the Spurs.  Irving shot 7-7 on 3P and 10-10 from the FT line. He and Steve Smith are the only players in NBA history to make at least five 3P and 10 FT in a game without a miss."
Kemba: *Smiles at his teammates while on the bench rehabbing*  Celtics Fans: “Now *this* is worth 3 million more than Kyrie Irving”
"**TEAM PACERS (with a twist)**  Billionaire Bruce Wayne sells his corporation and buys an expansion team, complete with an alternate timeline version of the Indiana Pacers.  Current teammates Paul George and Kawhi Leonard prove that -- while social media may hate them right now -- they can fit like a glove on virtually any roster in the league. They provide some excellent perimeter defense that, coupled with Myles Turner, leads these new Pacers to one of the best defensive ratings in the league (finishing # 2 overall.)  Offensively, the team can get caught up in some ""iso ball"" at times, but they manage to get bailed out by Kawhi Leonard's ability to win in those situations. The Pacers end the league year with the # 1 seed out East. The question from here is: will they step up when it counts? Or will PG+Kawhi fold once again?  Round 1 is easy, with the team sweeping the Knicks. In round 2, Boston doesn't provide much more resistance, with another 4-1 win for the Pacers.  The Eastern Conference Finals appear to be more of a challenge, as KD, James Harden, and Kyrie arrive in town ready to test that top-tier defense. Kawhi and Paul George gamely step up their games, but James Harden manages to create some foul trouble for them that limits their minutes. The Nets go up 2-1. Game 4 is even worse, as Kawhi Leonard runs cold and Paul George goes 3-13.  Now down 3-1, it appears as though these Pacers may be folding. However, they do have some aces in the hole: PG Malcolm Brogdon has emerged behind the scenes as a key leader for them, encouraging them to stiffen up and fight their way back into the series. Brogdon even steps up his share of the offense, bullying smaller Kyrie Irving and going for 19-7-8 in a Game 5 win. Kawhi and PG find their rhythm again in Game 6, leading to another win! The team has officially tied it up, 3-3!  Going into a pivotal game 7, everyone looks tight. The offense is slow -- stagnant at times -- and perhaps relying too much on one-on-one play. T.J. Warren tries to do a little too much of that, coughing up 3 turnovers in a game where he should probably be in a background role. In turn, the Nets get hot beyond the arc with Joe Harris hitting 4-7 threes. The Nets end up pulling away and winning this one 115-107.   Afterwards, the Pacers are disappointed, and wonder how much could have changed if they had the full effect of homecourt advantage. Alas, COVID had other plans in mind this particular season."
"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."
"Jrues been guarding Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for the last 10 minutes, completely dead tired but they finally go off.  James Harden checks in"
Because the last four years of sample size where we was a 48% shooter fro the field vs the 27 games this year where he's jumped to 52%. Even in his best playoff year he only did 48% from the field. Just an unreal 44% from 3 in their championship run. I've just watched a lot of Kyrie Irving and this doesn't seem sustainable to me. Could always be wrong.

"Because the Nets have James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving"
Does Malika Andrews report on anyone except Kyrie Irving? She's lucky he has his weird personality
I love Kyrie Irving and I'm not ashamed to admit it!
Kyrie Irving.   Also shoutout to Shamet
There are 3 eternal truths in life  1.	Death 2.	Taxes 3.	The Boston Celtics leaving Kyrie Irving open in transition
"Kyrie Irving is good, shame hes crazy"
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
"Yeah no way former MVPs Kevin Durant and James Harden, and all NBA player Kyrie Irving can do it without washed DeAndre Jordan."
"You mean the guy that was considered the 2 times finals mvp. was seen as the better player on the same team and was ranked higher by kerr himself while on the same team is not the better player. Kd has also been elite for way longer and is not a defensive liability.  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
Being forced to attend a flat earther lecture being given by Kyrie Irving. A fate worse than death.

"Or when the Celtics traded Isiah Thomas to the Cavs for Kyrie Irving. Cavs went on to an NBA finals after that trade, insane."
"And khris Middleton, Steph curry, Zach lavine, Kyrie Irving, Kevin durant, Paul George are also close"

A team assembled by a bunch of stars who literally half assed their jobs on their former teams so they could get bought out or traded to a free ring with the Brooklyn snakes. Oh and kyrie irving
"The most-recently-drafted Top 10 draft pick to even play in the Finals is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- drafted #8 overall by the Pistons in 2013.  The most-recently-drafted Top 10 pick to play in the Finals with his draft team was Harrison Barnes -- #7 overall by the Warriors in 2012.  Of the past 100 top 10 picks -- 2009 through 2019 -- only Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry have even played in the Finals with their draft team.  &amp;#x200B;  This idea that a team just needs a first-round pick to win is not well supported."

Man I think you need to watch some Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving highlights or something. Either of these guys can give you 50 any given night on top tier efficiency
Kyrie Irving is the coolest player to watch in the league
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"Yeah Danny. It’s the players fault that you replaced Kyrie Irving, Rozier, Hayward and Horford with Evan Fournier, Rob Will, Nesmith, Pritchard and Romeo fucking Langford."
"Uncle Drew as the Ancient One and Kyrie irving as Dr. Strange.  IT as Bruce Banner and Zion as the Hulk. ""That's my secret, Captain. I'm always hungry.""  LeBron or Durant as Nick Fury recruiting everyone to team up with him. LeBron would look better than Durant with an eye patch.  Klay Thompson as Hawkeye cause he's a marksman who only shows up hot from time to time."
Wow even Eric Bledsoe huh  Tatum had kyrie irving/Marcus Morris/Marcus smart/al horford/jaylen brown and couldn’t even get out the second round
" Harden’s most played 3-man lineup is with starters (Harden/Irving/Harris).   Harden’s most played 4-man lineup is with starters (Harden/Irving/Harris/Jordan)   Harden’s most played 5-man lineup is with starters (Harden/Irving/Brown/Harris/Jordan).  Go through the lineup data on basketball reference and you’ll see that the bulk of Harden’s +/- is built on lineups with starters.   And if he’s some god-tier MVP candidate, how does playing with serviceable bench players drag his net rating down **so much** that he’s hardly positive when he literally starts and plays a shit ton of minutes with Kyrie?"
"100% agreed. The actual “work” was pulling them out of the gutter, which is commendable. It takes zero effort to say “yes” to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant volunteering to join your team."
"Hard disagree. He’s done a good job, no doubt but the market he’s in helps tremendously. Better run teams than the Nets can make deep playoff runs for multiple seasons in a row and not sniff a meeting with a marquee free agent. The Nets get the 6 seed one time and bow out in 5 and get rewarded with fucking Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. He’s definitely good, but not the best in any sense of the word."
"&gt; Irving is playing almost at the same level,   Stop it.  There have been games where Kyrie has been better but Harden on the aggregate has been much better and is clearly the better player and (correctly) the focal point of that team."
"It was on first take but SAS went off on some tangent about kyrie Irving and Durant averaging 30.  He also brought up donald sterling, which I thought was a good parallel since he got railroaded after saying racist thing but Durant just went on a homophobic tirade and players won't bat an eye."
"Rfed, this is an incredibly optimistic view of the NBA.  Durant has missed almost 30 games this season Anthony Davis has missed around 25. Kyrie Irving has missed close to 15 games.   These are “the best athletes in the world” according to you. It’s not that they are not “performing well”, **they aren’t even performing most nights.**  It’s a joke to think that this is a great version of the NBA."

"&gt; This team doesn't play defense,  I agree that they're not elite on defense, but this is the greatest offensive roster ever constructed with Kyrie Irving as the 3rd option when KD is back. It would be the biggest embarrassment in league history if they do not win the title this year. hard to see a scenario where it happens, but I hope it does."
now do kevin durant and kyrie irving
"Imagine if the Nets do not win the title this year with Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc (assuming they're all playing). It would be an absolute embarrassment.   I'm honestly rooting for them to choke to see the backlash."
"i mean [look at this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mhjenf/why_is_lebron_so_widely_considered_to_be_higher/)  people bring up kareem winning with magic and people bring up lebron needing kyrie in 2016 as if kyrie irving is comparable to magic johnson, arguably a top 5 player in nba history  he's definitely extremely overrated and you wouldnt expect such comparisons from a player with 0 mvp votes"
u/ProudStephew do you think Kyrie Irving is a star or superstar?
&gt;If Kyrie Irving is so talented  and   &gt;He is very talented
My man Kyrie Irving.
"Ohh like Dwayne wade, kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Kevin love, Chris Bosh?"
His teammate is Kyrie Irving.  His team has given zero indication they care about things like this.
2011 when the Clippers who were like ~20 games under .500 traded an unprotected 1st round pick for Mo Williams. That pick became Kyrie Irving
"It's crazy how those picks basically turned into Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Colin Sexton (who was traded for Kyrie Irving) and yet it is likely that the Nets will end up winning a title before the Celtics."
"LOL ""muh defence!!!""   That means dick when the Nets will have at least two superstar offensive talents on the court pretty much at all times. Their third best player is Kyrie Irving. No defence is stopping this Nets offence when they have the most offensive firepower in the history of the league lmao."
"Steph/LeBron.  KD/Kyrie/Harden's season can still be ruined by a reporter asking Kyrie, ""Kyrie Irving, what is your opinion on used furniture?"""
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
"I’d rather he say “I could win a championship too if my teammates were James Harden and Kyrie Irving” or something similar which is a shot at a KD type guy, and it’s warranted, rather than just praising himself with the loyalty crap.  But people would also take it as insulting his teammates."
"I mean Wiggins and Bennett allowed them to get Kevin Love, which lead to a title in 2016. Their other 2 #1 picks (in the past 20 years) got them Lebron James and Kyrie Irving. Nephews on some weird shit atm"
"Two MVP’s, Kyrie Irving, and three other former all-nba players.   Yeah it’s championship or bust."
Whoever gave you that award chose the perfect one for kyrie third eye irving.
"Kyrie Irving, who you didn't even list, is a better offensive player than anyone on Utah's roster"
I don't think it's true that winning a couple championships equals another 10-15 million dollars in retirement. That's also to say that if you don't end up winning then you just cost yourself 10-15 million bucks by betting that you would win the championship and that in 15 years companies will pay you tens of millions simply because you were on a winning team. I think it only matters if you're a superstar or have a following like a Kyrie Irving. For all that you might as well negotiate the most money you can get on the front end.  Not to mention taking less fucks up the market for other nba players.
"The Nets have the NBA’s second-best record and second-best offense since landing James Harden. They’ve managed this despite Kevin Durant missing 24 games in that span, Kyrie Irving missing nine, and Steve Nash’s coaching staff having to cobble together a back half of the rotation reliant on up-and-down performers like Landry Shamet, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot, and Tyler Johnson. Harden has still managed to thrive despite the roster instability, leading the league in minutes and assists while also averaging 26 points and nine rebounds per game to keep Brooklyn surging. -Dan Devine"
"Even still. It wasn’t hard to watch the things he did and not be impressed. I think the biggest thing is an actual good team behind harden. Even with just Kyrie Irving, not a top 15 basketball player, and an incredible supporting cast he’s been allowed to flourish more than ever. He did all of the morey bullshit because he had to and they let him"
Well... Unless said player was Kyrie Irving
"If Harden was alone in Brooklyn, very few players would join this ship. James is forgetting Durant and Kyrie Irving is on this team, along with veteran auxiliary players. Ego is what the beard is cooking."
"What? Lost Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Kyrie Irving, Marcus Morris, and Gordon Hayward. That's a playoff starting 5 in the east"
"He literally had Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Isaiah Thomas, and Dwayne Wade all on that cabs team at some point. Just stop.   If that was KD and he got all those player yall would be crying about how a ‘super team’ is being formed just to beat lebron again regardless of how far out of their primes they are."
"bro harden has played like 5 games without kyrie and durant. You acting like he's playing with scrubs when he's got kai motherfucking irving almost every game dropping 28 points and 6 dimes with his typical dominance in the clutch. and he's got the best sniper in the league joe harris and some defenders like brown and claxton. And some other decent players. They should be a two seed, especially considering there are literally 3 legit playoff teams in the east.   &amp;#x200B;  Jokic is in one of the most stacked conferences of all time working with no other all stars and a bunch of scrubs. He has murray and porter and then scrubs."
"I mean its not the worst take. Most people have kd ranked higher tho. been elite for longer. More accomplishments- and was considered the go to guy when both were together. Its hard for curry to be as good just because of his size. Late playoff games are decided by iso ball. the game slows down plays break down and the only place to create space is the midrange. last 4 championships have been decided by midrange iso players. kawhi kd kd and lbj/davis. its harder to create space when you are small as you cant shoot over players. Also lebron stated that kd was his nemesis. Kerr stated that lbj kd and kawhi were better than curry in those years too. A two way wing is always gonna have more impact than a small pg. here are his words. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr isn't playing favorites, but he also isn't shy about naming the best player on his stacked title squad. Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact. ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer. ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game."" The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible. ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said. ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill. ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league. ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
"I was around for those series, I HATED Jason Kidd &amp; Kenyon Martin.  I hate the Lakers MUCH more than I hate the Nets, but I hate Kyrie Irving the most."
"I've been watching the NBA since the 90s, I am originally from Newton, MA (I live in Portland, OR now and there's no love for the Lakers out here, let me tell you), my hatred for the Nets has more to do with asshole New Yorkers and how loathsome Kyrie Irving is.  Trust me, I hate the shit out of the Lakers and I don't want to see the Lakers win at all, there's just something about this Nets team that really rubs me the wrong way.  But good on you for making some sweeping character judgements about me based on one comment, you must truly be a Masshole.  There certainly isn't any room for nuance or feelings that differ even slightly from your own."
Wait why KD? Literally all he did was join a team in free agency that was also signing Kyrie Irving.   Like is KD supposed to try and force the front office not to make any trades or sign any free agents? Was he supposed to go to Sean Marks and say he wouldn’t play if they traded for Harden?
"I feel the same way.  As deeply as my hatred for the Lakers is ingrained in my soul I hate all things New York, I hate the shit out of all the bandwagon Nets fans and I hate Kyrie Irving more than any other athlete in pro sports today.  I've rooted against LeBron for his whole career, but I respect the hell out of him (how can you not?) at least.  And there are tons of Laker bandwagon fans, but there's at least a history of success with that franchise that's understandable, the Nets are a garbage franchise that hasn't won anything &amp; their ""fans"" are walking around with their chests puffed out like they're coming off a 3-peat."
"So we’re just gonna ignore the fact they only went there to play a with a prime lebron James, kyrie Irving and kevin love?"
Lmao you just tried to use Wade from 2006 🤣🤣🤣.  Yes Lebron beat a team that was 73-9 with Kyrie irving.  Wade regressed yearly after 2010
"There are a lot of problems with the NBA cap and salary rules.  The biggest IMO is the max salary rule.  There is no way a team should be able to afford Durant, Harden, and Kyrie Irving, but the max salary is artificially lower than market value for those guys.  Meanwhile, small market teams (or teams with a competitive disadvantage of being in another country like Toronto) have to give max contracts to lesser stars like Gordon Hayward, Harrison Barnes, Pascal Siakam, etc. in the hopes that they develop or play up to their contract.  Meanwhile large market teams get to compete for the real stars, and they have enough money to apparently sign 3-4 of them because the max contract is artificially low and the salary cap is flexible."
"In fairness, that Warriors team that added Durant just lost the Finals, and who knows what would have happened in 2015 if Cleveland doesn't lose Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. They had a 2-1 lead and their 2nd best player was Matthew Dellavadova.   So maybe they needed KD?"
PG: Chris Paul (Reserve: Stephen Curry)  SG: Kyrie Irving (Reserve: Klay Thompson)  SF: Kevin Durant (Reserve: Scottie Pippen)  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Reserve: Kevin Garnett)  C: Nikola Jokic (Reserve: Hakeem Olajuwon)  Assistant Coach: Mike Dan Tony  Head Coach: Dick Carlisle
"Well, KD is right around the corner, and Irving and Harden have played the majority of their games together. KD is an easy insert, it's not like he's gonna be clueless with Harden and Kyrie.  I've seen the games. Chemistry is fine."
Ironman version of Kyrie Irving with lower fg%. When he was in Denver he was hovering around 45/35/75. Who knows how he would be if he grew up during the 3pt era. He grew up in an era of basketball of attacking the rim and midrange.
"I mean he’s shooting 40% this year from 3, so you can’t pack the paint lol  He’s one of my favorite players, and he doesn’t get near the recognition he deserves for being on of the top 5 best prospects in the league.  My comp would probably be something like Kyrie Irving tbh. His ability to finish at the cup and play big. He obviously doesn’t have the handles, but he has the size that Kyrie plays like he has lol."
"Kobe wanted out aswell but the Lakers got him all the help needed to compete and win championship. The others had great coaches and great or ""competent"" management aswell. They got everything needed to make it work from the team they got drafted to.  Bron was twice on the Cavs and the management clearly let him down - especially the first time around , so he left to play with best friend D-Wade in Miami but also wanted to fullfil his promise to bring a championship to Cleveland ""sometime"", so when he saw Kyrie Irving having crazy potential and he knew he ""owns"" the East - he knew it was time to leave Miami to rejoin the Cavs. Maybe if he stayed one year longer on Heat he would had a better chance in 2015 finals, but 2014 finals was really rough for him and even worse for Wade and Bosh.   Now Kyrie wanted out already after the 2016 finals win, which also lead to him not really talking with the team in the 2017 playoffs. So far lebron had a hand in every move cavs did so far after returning , but after Kyrie wanting out - the management took the upper hand in decisions. Now they somehow won the trade but IT and Crowder didnt workout, then ultimately dealt Rose and Wade away and I would argue especially the Wade trade led Lebron to wanting to leave again. I think if Kyrie stayed he would have done the same the following year and ended his career in Cleveland aswell."
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-wouldve-signed-with-knicks-if-team-was-run-halfway-decent-says-jared-dudley/  Because your the knicks, youre a historical franchise. KD definitely wanted to be there. Theyve literally traded all that young cast at this point. Kyrie + KD makes any team a contender without a cast just like lebron and ad in LA."
"""Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving each missed two games in the first round against the Hawks yet they still won 4-1""  I could see something like that"
Andre Drummond is nowhere near an all star anymore lol you must be slow if you really believe that. Nets have 2 top 5 players plus Kyrie Irving. Foh
Hahaha hahaha hahaha ***KYRIE IRVING?***
"You're exactly right and anyone who's not an idiot foresaw that the Nets are going to be fucking insanely nice. I cannot believe people thought James Harden KD and Kyrie Irving would just crumble becuase people thought they would have to have less touches lmao. It's honestly the disrespect to Harden since people legit don't watch him play (but are actually are watching him this year) and so they didn't realize that a player who has been a top 5 player for the past 5 years is actually good at basketball lol. People realize now that he's one of the best playmakers in the league and so he can elevate everyone around him, including KD and Kyrie. It's also the disrespect to Kyrie since he's a little bit nuts, but people forget he's a certified bucket in the playoffs. KD's game speaks for itself tho, people doubted he would come back this nice but he's looking just about as good as ever. I mean even if the three have to split touches, any one of Kyrie, Harden, or KD being relegated to catch and shoot for a possession or two is gonna result in a bucket lmao. We're talking about star players here they're gonna get buckets regardless lol"
"Because when superstars go public with their demands for a trade, the team makes it happen   See Kyrie Irving 2017, Anthony Davis 2019, Paul George 2019, Russell Westbrook 2019/2020, James Harden 2020..."
Wait kyrie irving who outplayed Steph curry in the finals and went toe to toe with him the next year? The guy who has one of the biggest shots in the history of basketball? Or James harden who dropped 35/7/5 on 62 TS% vs the kd warriors in the playoffs? Or James harden who dropped 30 on 60 TS% vs the lakers last year who had the best defense in the league?
"You realize Heat had three all stars too right? And Ray Allen who had all star performances during the playoff. Lebron left the Heat in 13, so your argument is that he had one year where Wade wasn't good, and then he immediately bailed to make another superteam. That's kind of a shitty argument.   &gt;    The point about Lebron is a hypothetical again, and Lebron’s won without “super teams” unless you consider Kyrie Irving and the shell of Kevin Love a superteam   You are fucking with me right? Kevin Love made all nba teams in both the years before joining Cleveland, and averaged 20/12 for his entire Minnesota run. If you somehow think he fell of a cliff in 2 years at 27 then you are seriously deluded. It's not his fault Lebron didn't know how to use him, and he had to stand in the corner shooting 3's. Kyrie had one of the best finals performances ever when they won? and hit a ton of the most important shots. He was also all nba and made like 4 all star teams in those years.  &gt; Durant may have been the best player, but Steph Curry led those teams. He was the franchise always.   Again a hopeless take. Durant was by far the best player on those teams. That's like saying Wade was the leader of the Heat teams, and therefore Lebron was the second most important player on two of his championships. Wade was also the heat franchise."
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30897633/kyrie-irving-tells-james-harden-point-guard-going-play-shooting-guard-brooklyn-nets-settle-roles
"Tony Parker, Chauncey Billups, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving"
"Golden State was way better than those Miami teams. 3 all stars and a Sixth man who played at All star level during the playoffs. Wade was fantastic until he got hurt in 2012, wasn’t the same player afterwards.  The point about Lebron is a hypothetical again, and Lebron’s won without “superteams” unless you consider Kyrie Irving and the shell of Kevin Love a superteam. Dude if you think Kevin Love was a top 15 player during any of those Cavs runs to the Finals you clearly were not watching the games lmao   Durant may have been the best player, but Steph Curry led those teams. He was the franchise always."
"Lol.   You had Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on your team, signed an all star in Gordon Hayward, then traded for Kyrie Irving all while still having a decent abundance of assets.   If issues and injuries didn’t get in the way, you could have had a team with 4 elite top 20 talents."
"Yeah no shit. Was it harden, Blake griffin, kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant that gave it away?"
"&gt; call it Harden’s streak as much as you like but it just isn’t.  He is literally destroying Kyrie in adv stats, even in additive stats like VoRP and WS he was ahead way before they were to reach parity in played games.  Harden is the definition of a team leader, of the kinds that win MVPs when also couple their performance with a high seeding.  Compare that with Steph's inability to hold his own (stats wise) once KD joined his team. Again, I am arguing facts here. KD missed (way too many) games yet still went toe to toe even in additive adv stats w Curry (in 2017).  Harden is more like Lebron when he joined the Heat. Yeah they had Wade and Bosh, however Lebron was the clear alpha. Apart from adv stats eye test concurs (irving-only games were often losses, Harden-only games are wins). They are different universes those two. Kyrie is a great scorer I can give you that, but he is a clear number two of the kinds that many teams have.   Now KD *is* on Harden's level, prolly better too if he could ever get himself healthy, however he is simply not playing in this stretch where Harden is leading the Nets to the 1st seed.  As for bad teams. Harden had one in 2019 , half his team was out, *still* beat you a$$es with that buzzer beater, you can't forget, it was quite the dagger.  Look I am not some Harden super fan, nor a Curry hater. Curry is a serial scorer much like Irving or Beal. I am merely trying to show how much more valuable what Harden does is. Ever since he reached his prime (since 2017 basically) he is basically that overman who could never find his no2 to compete properly (for a ship). Heck maybe he still hasn't , Kyrie is a scorer , but not much else, KD is an injury risk and may miss time in playoffs even and the rest are bags of bones. As far as superteams go this is one possibly pathetic one.   Contrast it w GSW's. Klay/Dray/Steph/KD all in their primes + a dependable bench. So it is a bit funny to hear y all talk about superteams. But anyway that is a talk for another time.  My point is that Harden should get his due. He is *leading* a team to a top 2 seed. He should be MVP frontrunner. I see BB ref already has him as No 2, so maybe it is a matter of time before everyone else wakes up. Maybe Harden haters won't, but thats OK, he is playing w the whole world (being) against him for his whole career. And again, I am most saying this as Harden fan, I have often been critical of him in the past, but rn he plays like a man possessed and I *have to* give him his due. How can you be so blind?"
They can just hand the Nets the throphy now this chip is over  who is stopping that squad when KD Kyrie or Irving can give you 40 a piece a night
"Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving &amp; Lebron James was a super team in 2015.  The reason the Warriors got to the Finals that year was because the talent level was low in the league. Like I said, transitional period, the old guard in Duncan, Kobe etc were moving on and the young guys weren’t established in the league yet.  Besides Warriors and Cavs. You had Lob City Clips, Al Horford Hawks, Lowry Derozan Raptors, Harden Dwight Rockets, Dame LMA Blazers, KD &amp; Russ who were hurt a lot.  That’s how bad the talent was. Most teams had 1-2 All Stars at most. Lebron-Kyrie-Love is 100% a super team in comparison to the rest"

"Not only did harden tank his value and demand a trade.   Kyrie irving also tanked his value by skipping games and creating fake drama in the team. This opened the trade field with basically ""nobody wants kyrie irving"" once he was untradeable they knew that harden would be a target and they could take all 3.  If kyrie was playing the way he is now and did IMMEDIATELY after the trade happened then there is no way he wouldnt be requested in the trade for james harden.  Fuck both those guys for gaming the system. Fuck blake griffin for faking it in detroit, fuck kevin durant."
"famous nets drafted players like james harden kyrie irving and kevin durant all of which came due to the incredibly successful and prestigious nets organization, not at all because they happen to be in the new york market"
Do you play 2k? As someone who sparingly plays with the all time nets Kyrie Irving is the only current Net on the All Time Nets in 2k   https://www.2kratings.com/teams/all-time-brooklyn-nets
Embarrassing. One of the best supporting cast but they are trash without him?  'Superstar' Kyrie Irving? GTFO there's like 5 superstars Kyrie isn't one of them.  And none of what you described compares to the Warriors or the Nets teams. These are historically stacked teams Lebron's teams were just big 3s in a league with a history of endless big 3s.
"Lebron joined up with Wade and Bosh, and had the best bench in the NBA with one of the best coaches. Then jumps back on a team with superstar Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, again with one of the best supporting cast in the NBA. Then goes to the Lakers with a top five player and one of the best supporting cast. Dawg."
"Imagine telling someone 5 years ago that the Nets could field a starting 5 of:  James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge"
"People were bitching because they added LMA and Blake for free to a team that already has Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
Kyrie Irving
"What superstar free agents signed with the Nets? 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge? Blake Griffin with no knees? Brooklyn was such a joke two-three years ago that even Knicks fans were like ""lol nobody cares about the nets"". Name one superstar free agent besides Kyrie Irving that signed with either Brooklyn or New Jersey.  I'll wait."
"I can understand trading for all these guys, but using the buyout market is simultaneously fucking over the franchise they just left and creating a loophole for the new team to acquire talent for nothing. Blake is making $32 MILLION off the Pistons, and the Nets have him on a minimum contract. Aldridge is making $18 million off the Spurs. It's making a mockery of the salary cap.  Add this to my distaste for James Harden and Kyrie Irving and you have the most despicable team ever assembled."
"&gt;They have Harden, KD and Kyrie, 2 of the 3s shots are gonna be falling a night at least  Harden, Griffin, and Irving are inefficient shooters in the playoffs.  Aldridge is terrible in the playoffs.  Harris has been poor in a small sample.  It's a lot more complicated than that."
You're still here? Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and James Harden and Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge want to play for the Brooklyn Nets. That is all I'm going to respond to you from here on out. Continue to bash your head against Brooklyn brownstone if you'd like.
And I still don't care. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and James Harden and Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are playing for the team based in my hometown.
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
Lebrons teams have all been “super teams” as well. Lebron wouldn’t have won in Miami without all stars Wade and Bosh even Ray Allen. He wouldn’t have won in Cleveland without All Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and he wouldn’t have won with the Lakers without All Star Anthony Davis.
"Definitely not. A player of KD's calibre doesn't choose a team because Kyrie Irving is there. He actually stated multiple times he went to the Nets because they have the best medical staff in the league, which he needed after the Warriors fucked around misdiagnosing the seriousness of his injury."
"eh, not so much harden. kd and irving left their teams for wack reasons. harden didnt.  i think if tilman hadnt pushed both mda and esp morey out, harden leaving woulda left a much worse taste in my mouth. but we all know prob the biggest reason for harden leaving was tilmans completely mismanagement and meddling with the team  kd and kyrie otoh were much much less justified in leaving okc/cle/bos"
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge want to play ball with Brooklyn on their chest. I'm so proud of my hometown, and the work that Sean Marks has done."
"Maybe he was referring to the addition of them to, you know, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. I have a strong feeling that he wasn’t suggesting that LMA and Blake are better than Lebron and AD lmao"
I can’t believe there are still nephews out there that think Lebron rejoined the Cavs to “finish business”. That’s hilariously pathetic. Yeah let’s just ignore the fact that the heat were getting old and battered by the end of their 2014 run and let’s also ignore that the Cavs had Kyrie Irving (one of the best young players in the game who’s playstyle really compliments Lebron well) and enough trade assets to get Kevin Love who was absolutely dominant back then. But sure he did it for Cleveland and not because it put him in the best position to win and once again own the East so it was a clear path to the finals. You are one of the biggest nephews on here.
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."
"That’s not the point though  James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Joe Harris WILL play when it matters and then when one of them comes off you got extremely experienced vets to come on and maintain leads   They’re going to be insanely hard to beat 4 times out of 7 games, they have 5 or 6 players that could score 25 points in a game pretty easily"
"Imagine if 5 years ago someone told you Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge would team up to play on the freakin Nets"
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc  This is a finals lock, it would be an absolute embarrassment if they do not win the title this year."
"“Kyrie Irving, a practicing Muslim”... since when? Maybe I’m just out of the loop but I never knew he was Muslim."

"This is your first year as a truly elite defence, so you might not be aware but when you have a league-leading defence, your players are generally all really highly ranked in team defensive metrics.   In 2017-18 we had a 1a/1b defence alongside Utah. Smart, Brown, Tatum, Rozier and Horford were all top 20 in DRTG that season.  That doesn't mean they were all top 20 defenders.   In fact, here's some early Kyrie stats for the season:  &gt;[He currently ranks second in the league in steals per game, eight in defensive win shares, seventh in individual defensive rating, and sixth in deflections per game.](https://www.celticsblog.com/2017/11/8/16612652/film-study-kyrie-irving-and-the-boston-celtics-pick-and-roll-defense)   You can't come out of that and say ""well if he keeps it up he's DPOY"" because he still wasn't having that sort of impact on the court. Even playing this well, he was at best our 5th-6th best defender on the roster.  Very good, yes. DPOY, no.  When your whole team is playing great defence it's normal to have guys peaking in stats like this.   He's a fantastic defender but at 6'5 and still unable to get serious playing time because of his poor offence, Mattise doesn't have the size, versatility or opportunity to be DPOY."
"Siakam was a killer during that playoff run. Doing everything on D, acting as a second banana and scoring when he saw his chances.   He probably isn't going to lead us to a ring as THE guy, but as a 2nd best player, he's elite. Kyrie Irving ain't leading shit as THE guy either. Very few players can."
Kyrie Irving or Tracy McGrady
Kyrie irving. His game is beautiful to watch and truly graceful/skill based.
Not for this one.   You’re thinking of the ESPN type stats that are like “Kyrie is the first person in nba history to win a ring with the Cavs in 2016 while also having played for the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn nets while having the last name Irving”.

Kyrie Irving
"&gt;His ability to get to the rim and slash in the halfcourt is much more limited than the likes of Kyrie Irving. That does not mean that he's not a dominant finisher,  Sure it does. When the game slows down in the playoffs (in a real series, not against injured teams under .500) that's exactly what it means"
"Once again - Giannis' scoring doesn't get worse against the Western Confernece. This point you are making is entirely disingenuous and not supported by fact. It is hard to take you serious here when you aren't willing to spend five minutes fact checking your statements.  Second, Giannis' efficiency has been driven down by poor FT shooting and not being able to reliably convert on attempts outside of the paint (his lack of counter moves is a problem). Though he is a dominant **finisher**, he doesn't have great handles. His ability to get to the rim and slash in the halfcourt is much more limited than the likes of Kyrie Irving. That does not mean that he's not a dominant finisher, because once he's in the remote vicinity of the rim he can finish above and through contact like few others ever have been able to."
They got beat by Jimmy Butler I’m taking Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for sure
LEFRAUD HAS WON 0 RINGS!!!!!!!  2012: Baby Thunder  2013: Carried by Ray Allen  2016: Carried by Kyrie Irving  2020: LeMickey Mouse Ring   LEBUM AINT WON SHIT! MICHAEL JEFFERY JORDAN WOULD NEVER
KD has evolved beyond what ordinary humans think is an excellent basketball player. He doesn't need approval of earths terrestrial species - not kyrie irving
Kyrie Irving (personal reasons) will miss rest of the season
"Also, what does Kyrie Irving have to do with me being a young buck? I can’t pick anyone in todays league? I don’t understand the correlation. I called you a young buck for not agreeing that Ray Allen is a dawg... and hoping you aren’t going off of the latter years."
"not in the name of Lebron, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving, and Lamarcus Aldridge"
"Steph way above the rest. Steph had 2 finals run and almost two peated before KD joined. Steph makes KD look good.  Kawhi led a team he joined for one season and won.  KD is behind Kawhi because joining not only a championship ready team but also the team with the BEST regular season record ever should get no credit whatsoever. People need to stop value championship hopping players.   Harden had Westbrook, CP3, and decent teammates. Never even got in to a finals. He is overrated like Paul George, or Kyrie Irving. Harden is not even on the same level as the other three players."
"The ""greatest shooter ever"" doesn't even have a top 10 3 point playoff shots of all time  Ask Ray Allen what it means to hit a big 3 in the playoffs, ask Kyrie Irving, Ask Robert Horry"
Mike James is like Kyrie Irving Light but more problematic lol
"Draymond isn't a true part of the big 3.  He's a great supporting cast player, he has never and will never be able to score like Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, Steph, Klay, etc etc etc.  Draymond would be the worst player of any ""big 3"" Ever."
Harden is also passing it to kyrie Irving and legit shooters while westbrook has one of the worst shooting teams in the league
Kyrie was already at Cleveland   Wade was already at Miami  Are you saying Kevin Love or Chris Bosh are the equivalent of James Harden or Kyrie Irving
he keeps tryna do stuff like he's kyrie irving. He's gotta simplify
"Kyrie Irving, 54 points on 19/23 shooting  Harden 53-16-17  Lebron james scoring 29 out of the last 30 to beat the pistons  Westbrook 50/16/10 and a buzzer beater vs the nuggets"
"Bruh the Nets have JAMES HARDEN and KD, 2 of the top 3 scorers in nba history on their team. They also have Kyrie Irving who might be the best 3rd option in nba history. When you have those 3 guys and shooters surrounding them their defense just has to be slightly average for them to win everything. Because at the end of the day Dennis Shroder, Kuzma and Drummond won't mean shit when Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, and Landry Shamet are getting wide open looks because teams are trying to double Harden and Durant."
"You can’t anoint a Nets team that hasn’t won anything.    The Warriors super teams are very good, but even they lost to a Cleveland team whose second best player was Kyrie Irving.  They didn’t win the title when they went 73-9.    And sure, let’s just start making up more fantasy by saying “remove X player and fictitious stat”    Lol.  You’re a clown, dude."
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
"I think this shows how good Durant is. And how good LeBron is. They played with hall of famers but they were always the best player on the team. Durant vs Curry is close but that just helps my point, KD can play with Steph Curry and still arguably be the best player. So if you open this discussion up to stars who weren't the best player, it's probably Kyrie Irving because he played with LeBron and KD. Who has more help right now, KD or Kyrie Irving? Clearly Irving, because he has KD on his team. KD doesn't have anyone on his team as good as KD. The answer could also be Scottie Pippen or Kevin McHale or James Worthy or whoever was the worst ""star"" on the Bill Russell teams. The way your question is framed makes us want to cheapen the success of whichever player is the answer, but I argue you can look at it the other way around and use it as an argument that whichever player is the answer and was always the best player on the team is truly great."
"LeBron has played with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving,  Kevin Love and Anthony Davis"
"Kawhi beat a prime 76ers team, Giannis, and the Warriors to win a championship. His second best player was Kyle Lowry. Lebron needed Kevin love and Kyrie Irving to do the same thing. Kawhi’s also beaten Lebron to win a championship.   He’s not even 30 yet. Lets allow him to finish his career first before you call him 25-40 all time. If he wins a ring with the Clippers he will be top 10."
"Ok this is just ridiculous. The Nets are not THAT good.  The best basketball of Oladipo's life is a player that's on par with Kyrie Irving.  Butler has shown to be one of the best playoff performers in the NBA, and Bam shows up in the playoffs too. They'd still be less talented than KD/Harden/Kyrie, but not to a ridiculous extent. Add to that the fact that the Heat would be elite on both ends of the floor if Robinson and Herro were able to consistently perform at their best, and the Heat could absolutely win the series.  Is very very unlikely that those things happen, BUT, if Dipo, Herro, and Robinson were playing the best basketball of their careers, the Nets would absolutely not win in 4 or 5, thats ridiculous."

Kyrie Irving is 0/8 when guarded by facts and reason.
"Bullshit. We all saw how Lebron lost to the Warriors in 2015 when he tried to beat the Warriors single handedly. Kyrie was incredible in the 2016 Finals (did you forget his championship winning shot?) and if he isn’t there Lebron loses again. Yes, Lebron beat a Warriors team with massive fire power. But Jordan never had a teammate as offensively talented like Irving or loads of 3 point shooters like the Cavs."

Close to Kyrie Irving. 100% serious
Kyrie Irving literally picks when he plays.
"Easy to get an assist record when your teammates are Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Joe Harris"
"They made some huge roster changes this season and very quickly became the one of the favorites for the championships. As a result they have a lot of bandwagon fans that don’t really know too much about basketball or the team and those people are the most toxic. I don’t see that as a reason not to like them though. Just have a sense of humor about yourself and the team and you’re better than 90% of other people that started following this year.  The team itself is very entertaining to watch. Of our big three, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, all of them have very different play styles. Harden is a monster of a point guard, very good at getting buckets and even better at assists. Kyrie is one of the best ball handlers playing the game today and his playing is always smooth. Durant is almost as famous for his antics on social media as he is for his bball skills and the man is on many lists as one of the top three players. He makes the difficult look easy, a master of his craft.   Besides the superstars, there’s Joe Harris, one of the best three point shooters in the NBA having the best year in his career. They have three young players, Alize Johnson, Shamet, and Nic Claxton, with a lot of hustle whenever they come off the bench.   Basically, it’s a team with a very new roster and high offensive potential but glaring defensive weaknesses. It’s a great opportunity to watch three future hall of famers play together."

"Yeah from my perspective getting Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Kyrie Irving because of a trade was a terrible idea"
That’s a good point so what’s Kyrie Irving a star player or a superstar
Pick one   Fucking Kyrie Irving gets time off everytime he watches a sad movie.
Kyrie Irving could but he'd have an issue with the globe aspect
"Right, but he is the third most important player on his own team.  You dont think Mitchell or CP3, who are fringe act MVP candidates themselves, should make it over Kyrie?  Abd you didnt address the point about Irving missing games for personal reasons.  People pay attention to that.  CP3 has missed just one game despite being 35 yrs old.  That's an accomplishment in itself."
Booker doesn’t take the team anywhere just like Kyrie Irving didn’t take the Cavs anywhere. Luka takes your team to the playoffs just by having him. Would gladly trade Booker for Luka any day of the week and throw in a top-3 protected first round pick also if needed.
To be honest man I don’t follow the NBA to closely so don’t take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he’s my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that’s why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
I feel like here maybe a good place to comment this great article:  https://theathletic.com/2518117/2021/04/15/aldridge-kyrie-irving-says-its-time-for-all-of-us-to-retire-the-n-word-and-hes-right/?source=user_shared_article
"&gt;I guess that would fix the problem, but it's too much collateral damage to me.  I don't think having LESS playoffs makes the product better... when NBA are playoffs are one of the best things in sports period.  And that's the trade-off one makes.  This happens in every sport.  You can either have an inclusive playoff, or an intense regular season, but not both.  &gt; So, Not only would the Nets have to pay $20 million tax PER PLAYER for all being $20 million over the ""max per year"" rate.    This doesn't matter unless some small-market/cheap-owner team can afford to pay $80M for Kyrie Irving, while fielding a mediocre team.  They cannot, or will not.  &gt; So, while it may not completely fix the problem... it will help.   It won't -- unless you are a Clipper fan.  Look at baseball.  Look at futbol.  Those are the models you are copying, and they do not produce parity -- and would be far worse in a sport where a team doesn't need 7 to 10 players to dominate."
How are the LaMelo Ball-less hornets beating Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant????  &amp;#x200B;  Those guys need so much help to win.
"Kyrie Irving missed 3 Playoff Series, Gordon Hayward missed 5 playoff series. Kyrie alone is more then Embiid and Simmons combined (when Philly has made the playoffs)"
"Uhh that's not what he said at all.   &gt;I was supposed to guard [Kevin Durant]. We match up well size wise. KD’s out. The next person I’m guarding is Kyrie [Irving]. Like, who’s doing that? It’s not many players who are doing that. And to be doing it at a high level like that? I don’t think there’s anybody else really doing that. I mean, Kawhi [Leonard] when he was really playing defense like that, of course. But, it’s not too many guys.  Interviewer: Didn’t Kyrie have, like, 37 last night though?  &gt; Yeah, but we won. His plus/minus was negative, too [it was -13]."
Like Kyrie Irving if he was 90% worse
"&gt; I was supposed to guard [Kevin Durant]. We match up well size wise. KD’s out. The next person I’m guarding is Kyrie [Irving]. Like, who’s doing that?  Simmons really acts like he's the only good wing defender in the league."
"&gt; DeFeNcE  The Nets would have two of the three best players in the series plus Kyrie Irving, who is so much better than any Lakers role player it’s not even funny. Defence probably won’t matter much with 60% of an All-Star starting lineup."
I still bet you'd rather him than Kyrie Irving bailing on you
"We woulda done some 15ft runner floater off the backboard like we put away the raptors. LeBron has Championship DNA, Kyrie Irving needs assistance"
"This some BS right here. Lebron didn’t drag Deldova to the Finals. Kyrie Irving was playing most of the playoffs in 2015. He got injured in Game 1 of the Finals. So its not like Lebron carried the whole team because Kyrie played in the ECF and earlier rounds. Plus Lebron had the luxury of playing in the weak East. He only had to face the Hawks which were a pretender. And lets not act like the Cavs were role players were bad. Mozgov, TT, Shump, and JR were all solid players. KD might have had slightly better players but he had to play way better teams in the West. Lebron carried the Cavs to 2 wins in the 2015 Finals. But that is only 2 wins. Don’t act like he carried the whole team without other Stars through the whole playoffs."
Bruh LeBron James is 100% a better scorer than Kyrie Irving. You can give Kyrie as many gold stars you want for arbitrary categories but a mountain of evidence that spans over a decade points to a very clear answer
kyrie irving gonna need a personal day to process this
Now you had KD Harden and the ghost of Kyrie Irving
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
"I hate Pat Bev and I hate KD for two different reasons, Pat Bev is a dirty player who thinks hes better than he is, KD has an immense skillset but he needs to win a ring without putting together a team that is heavily favorited, but honestly nowadays i hate kyrie irving the most. He doesnt show up to play, he talks down to people media players with a superiority complex and there is something incredibly phony about him the last few years"
Kyrie “Jacob “Stephen “Bradley Beal” Curry” deGrom” Irving
Kyrie “Jacob deGrom” Irving
"The fact that kyrie irving hasn't retired from basketball this year is what impresses me the most about Steve Nash. Say what you will about on the floor strategem, but as far as leadership and culture he's kept our team tightly focused. Also with so many moving parts in our lineup, in genuinely amazed how well every combination gels together in such a short amount of plays. Very proud of our coaching staff this year especially on whatever they are doing in practices."
"ben is 6’11.. smaller people move quicker laterally. plus this isn’t a regular person, this is kyrie irving, best ball handler in nba history (or AI)  edit: he didn’t even blow by him, played decent defense on him"
&gt;	Sorry but 30 points on 54% TS is not being shutdown. Especially against an elite defense  He went from 63.4% to 54.2 % thats dogshit and hilariously bad. Look at any other all time great and they don’t dip nearly as bad as Durant did before moving to golden state. It wasn’t until he had an all time great guard do all of the heavy offensive lifting so he could get the easy mismatch in the low post shooting over kyrie Irving. Lol
"L take. Nets have two top5 players, Kyrie irving and a solid supporting cast. If we beat them I'll be out of my mind, but they're just way too good"
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/01/25/report-kyrie-irving-threatened-have-knee-surgery-if-cavs-didnt-trade-him/1067094001/
If you seriously think Kyrie Irving is better than Allen iverson you’re out of your fucking mind man.
AI is more skilled and better than Kyrie Irving
I’m just over people clutching their pearls every time Kyrie Irving doesn’t want to talk to them. Who cares? Who wants to hear from this dude on a regular basis? My man sounds like he eats Thai Sticks for breakfast. The media needs the content so I understand why they get so upset(I don’t agree with them but I understand) but I’ve never understood it from the fans perspective.
Kyrie weighs less than Durant.   So how is Irving the most skilled and Not also the best pound for pound?
"No, KD just hasn’t accomplished anything impressive for a player of his skill level.   Curry won back to back MVPs, including the first unanimous MVP. Award or no, was the most valuable player on a finals team (probably multiple tbh.) Led the greatest regular season run of all time. Was a nut kick away from beating a great team led by maybe the greatest player of all time in his prime.   Harden won an mvp, almost beat the greatest team basketball has ever seen, and is clearly the most valuable player on a team consisting of Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving.   Kevin Durant won an MVP, choked a 3-1 lead to Curry, and won maybe the two most meaningless championships of all time on someone else’s already dynasty-level team.   And this is advance metrics and on/off numbers aside, which don’t bode well for him when compared to Harden or especially Curry."
I was expecting KDWarriors level dominance so anything below that would mean I am disappointed. I just had way too high expectations. I wish we got to see them together a bit more but I'm worried at this point about Kyrie Irving not fitting in with the others
"Yes, both of their games are built on intangibles. But I think CP3’s intangibles are better. Steph Curry and Kyrie Irving are both great shooters, but one is one of the best of all time and other is one of the best of his generation."
"&gt;  without complaint because it helps grow the sport and fan engagement  I really doubt a lot of players care that much man. They do it because they get told to. Besides no one is tuning into the NBA more because Lebron told us ""both teams played hard"" or some shit.  I really don't see how it's a big deal. He didn't do something he was meant to, got punished for it. That's the end of it really, my enjoyment isn't impacted by not hearing some platitudes from Kyrie Irving and I can't imagine many people are. Even on this sub where it seems to be a big deal"
CP3 is the last pure point guard in the league. Sure he's not a great shooter as curry is but he's a far better defender and playmaker than curry.... don't put cp3 and curry in the same conversation. They excel in different aspects of the game. Its like comparing Ray Allen and kyrie Irving
"I think its just an experience thing too, knowing how to show the ball or open yourself up to the contact so its an obvious foul. Some players who are acrobatic/finesse finishers (like Kyrie Irving or Zach Lavine) have trouble accepting physical contact but Ant is a power finisher who's gonna draw a lot of calls in his prime.  Bradley Beal went through the same issues but now he's like a FT magnet."
The less words from Kyrie Irving the better. The dude is a fucking idiot.
Do you remember watching Harden play the Jazz in the playoffs? Now imagine if he also had Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving next to him.
Kyrie Irving is a fucking moron.
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving vs Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley.  Brooklyn in 4."
I think “discussing stupid” is exactly why the Kyrie Irving story never goes away.
The players are a product that's what the price for being payed extraordinary amounts of money the fans that see it as a product are the ones that are keeping the league afloat because that's what people want answering some questions and playing basketball is what allows kyrie irving to live the luxurious life he does and he can't even do that. Nba superstars arent your friends they exist to entertain us for what? 10 years of their life in change they become part of the 1% and get more wealth than a person can waste

Did Kyrie Irving teach you to be an anti vaxxer on his flat earth spaceship?
"I think the most underrated player depends on how you get your sports news and updates.   Zion seems to be flying under the radar this year despite being a Top 10 scorer, similarly to Zach Lavine and Kyrie Irving.  I also don't hear much about Mitchell, Fox, or Sexton.   Marcus Morris, Bryn Forbes, and Michael Porter Jr. have all been lights out from three this year."

"No, they’re gonna depend on James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving to score. You just asked who else they had.  KD and Harden are a guaranteed 30 in the playoffs. Kyrie is a possibility but probably closer to 25. Still don’t see your point. They have the best scoring team of all time on paper."
"Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, The Celtics big 3 trade albeit they were old. Deron Williams, Dr J, Buck Williams, Rick Barry, Drazen Petrovic, Kenyon Martin, Joe Johnson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden. I know plenty about the nets they’ve always been a team I’ve followed.   They had a few bad seasons in the late 2000s early 2010s but as far as talent, the Nets have had a good chunk of the top 50 come through there lol.  Edit: forgot to mention Darryl Dawkins"

The point is Bron is pissed that now he might have to play in a sudden elimination tournament when he was more than happy to have other teams do so just a year ago."
About how the Nets will walk to the finals. You moved it from that all the way to me saying who can guard Kyrie? You’re just trying to argue about anything to defend the 76ers lmao   Matisse Thybulle cannot guard Kyrie Irving...at all.
"No you weren’t, you were just trying to move the goalposts of the argument once again. You relinquished small points but still stood pat on the integrity of your debate. “Yeah we don’t have Butler but we’re better”, etc. That’s a disingenuous point, you’re definitely biased.   I hate Kyrie much more than any team, you can play the biased angle all you want but it’s a little hypocritical from the guy claiming Matisse Thybulle can guard Kyrie Irving. He can’t and he’d get embarrassed."
"Let me break this down for you even further, since you still don’t understand it.   Matisse Thybulle cannot guard Kyrie Irving and in a playoff series Kyrie will have his way with him. You replied to my claim with “so nobody can guard him???”   Lol no, I said Matisse Thybulle can’t guard him. Now, you’re trying to deflect that point by saying “well who can guard him then” as if Thybulle is the best defender in the league and if he can’t nobody can lmao. I could name 100 players and I’m sure you’ll nitpick and argue each one, I’m all set on that. Matisse Thybulle can’t defend Kyrie and that’s all that matters pertaining to *this* conversation. You did misrepresent my point, you’ve done it a few times. That’s not even debatable.   I don’t want to argue about this at all actually. It’s 3:47 AM and I have a biased 76ers fan who’s been arguing every single point I’ve made that wasn’t pro 76ers for hours to the point where he’s trying to convince me Matisse Thybulle can slow down Kyrie Irving in a playoff series lmfao."
"""You won't be able to score on us buddy"" the last time the sixers and nets played Kyrie Irving dropped 37 points on 13/22 shooting in 32 minutes. The Nets scored 117 points without Harden and KD, arguably the 2nd and 3rd best scorers of all time. But yea I'm sure your defensive players will be able to stop them."
"Nba #1 picks are probably the most sure fire #1 picks of any of the 4 major American sports. In many cases even if you don't get the best guy, you'll still end up with a hall of famer like Hakeem, AI, and Kyrie Irving"
"Not exactly the answer to your question, but...  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best."
"Kyrie is a great point guard, who's to say Harden would do better handling the ball on any given night.  I'm not convinced he will contribute that much more on offense with Kyrie and Durant out there. I mean staggering shifts will certainly give them top tier offence for 48 minutes. But the Nets D is weak and he certainly won't help, especially in the staying rotation with Harris and Irving."
"What's the difference between getting a switch for KD and Kyrie vs. having Harden there to potentially making getting good switches easier? Not a lot.   And replacing Jeff Greens decent defence with Hardens bad D might be a worse overall trade off. You have a line up of Joe Harris, Irving and Harden to defend Gianiss - yikes."
Kyrie Andrew Irving with the assist
"They won because kevin love and kyrie irving didn’t play   When they did play, they blew a 3-1 lead in the most dramatic fashion in sports history, right next to playoff p and kawhi collapsing last year"
"Does it count if LeBron leaves your team, causing you to tank and draft Kyrie Irving, then LeBron returns to the post-tank team because he’ll have a better supporting cast this time around?"
Probably the hate on stars like Kyrie Irving and KD
"The history of Islamic empires, militias, or regimes has nothing to do with kyrie Irving’s decision to convert nor the Muslim youths embrace of kyrie Irving. It also has nothing to do with Islamic ideology or Islamic spirituality. I have indicated many times I have no interest in any discussion over the past because it’s completely irrelevant. By talking abt states and this random stuff that has nothing to do with kyrie or Islam, you make Islam and Muslims look bad in a thread filled with ppl trying to find a reason to justify their hatred of Muslims. This is why ur comment is akin to misinformation."
How? Please explain to me how Kyrie Irving using the Star of David emoji at the end of this message shows that he is antisemitic and thinks that the jews are controlling the media.  He's just being a drama queen. That's what he does. There's no hidden layers here for you to dissect there no reading between the lines here
"It would be considered a pagan ritual and not cool if you ask literally any Imam. And you should, reddit and Kyrie Irving are not sources of Islamic scholarship, but Sage doesn't even grow anywhere near the Middle East"
"Yeah, my family burns it for the smell of it.  This is different form upholding a pagan tradition that Kyrie's native ancestors used to purify a place.  Islam is very strict about Monotheism of Allah, and rejecting polytheistic traditions. Muslims are taught that they just need to make prayer to Allah and Allah alone. Allah is the only one who will provide.      "" But, literally, it's more or less for us to stay connected and for us to feel great about going to work and feeling safe and provided for from our ancestors. I'm not going to bring too much of the spirituality into basketball, but yeah, it's part of my native culture where I'm from.""  Burning sage, or ""smudging,"" is a [Lakota ritual](https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/indigenoustraditions/%E2%80%A2-ceremonial-reflections/smudging-geertz-and-ceremony/) which is done prior to most ceremonies with the intent of using what is considered to be the ""cleanest"" herb to chase away the ""dirt"" of impure thoughts, actions and other related issues.

currently it's Tristan Thompson.  All time probably Ricky Davis although you can make a better case for it being Kyrie Irving than you can for the world being flat
"&gt;Well that’s because the language he’s using recently is very close to that of the NOI.   Like what, I googled ""Kyrie Irving Nation of Islam"" and all that came up was stuff about him fasting for Ramadan"

&gt;does so against much tougher defensive pressure  Does he though? Its been a while but its not like Kyrie hasn't shown out against playoff level defenses either. And he's only gotten better in the past few years.  I don't particularly care whose better but you're disrespecting Irving if you seriously think that.
"Derek fisher, mario chalmers, kyrie irving"
"Thank you.  Isiah Thomas - Kyrie Irving - Kemba Walker  All high usage, negligible playmaking, zero Defense undersized PGs whom the NBA has already moved on from and can no longer be the Center piece in an elite team.  Starting to think Ainge is overcompensating for being the forgotten member on the 86 Celtics."
"&gt;	 KD doesn't need to be a top playmaker, he actually being good even if he's not top playmaker on top of him being the best scorer and best offensive player OF ALL TIME   If that were true why couldn’t he be the playmaker without averaging a turnover per assist when trying to create without Westbrook in OKC? Why was he never trusted with the ball (according to touches, time spent with ball, dribbles per possession, pass completed) in golden state: that was left up to Curry and Draymond green. Why? Because the moment Curry (or Westbrook) left the floor Durant’s efficiency cratered and he turned the ball over at an embarrassing rate if he’s an all time great.   What other top 20 player constantly turns the ball over at a historic rate when he doesn’t have an all time great creator doing all the heavy offensive lifting?   Here’s an idea: the *idea* of Durant being the best scorer ever is nice but when it comes to him being the primary ball handler/creator and scorer, he turns the ball over and over and his efficiency plummets below league average.   The “””””haters””””” on this sub are critical of Durant because of his play within its proper context.   This isn’t even to mention that he choked massively alongside an MVP-candidate then joined a 73 win team with the reigning MVP in his prime. Now he’s with james harden and kyrie Irving lol"

How is Kyrie Irving much better than Dame?
kyrie irving
"Kyrie Andrew Irving, his initials"
In no particular order :  MJ C. Drexler  Iverson White Chocolate Vincent Carter Curry LeBron Magic Shaq Rodman CP3 Damien Lilliard Kyrie Irving KD
They traded him to a lebron team. For kyrie irving lol i would do tbat deal too
"Jason Kidd changed the whole Nets culture while guys like Kyrie Irving were watching as kids. There is no superteam today if it wasn't for him.  In the same way that the All-Time Warriors team has Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Durant, Chris Webber etc... but Steph Curry is obviously the team captain. The All-Time Nets have Dr. J, KD, Harden, Vince Carter, etc., but Jason Kidd is the captain."
He played hurt physically and emotionally after his sister died unexpectedly for the boston celtics after getting them to the playoffs and even won them a series. They lost the next round because he couldn't play anymore. Then ainge traded him to the cavs for kyrie irving and thomas has never been the same since.   And no good free agent has chosen the Celtics since. Save kemba and horford.
"Better with kyrie. Irving fills his role of being a scorer who occasionally passes about as well as anyone. He gets to shine at what he likes to do.  Harden is already about as good of a playmaker as you can ask for, so there is no need to add CP3. Also those guys don't like each other so I don't see them working well together."
"I dont know how people determine positions. Personally I dont care what your official title is. Harden is a point guard. He runs the point. Kyrie Irving is a shooting guard. Both players CAN fill either role. Kyrie Irving even said Harden should run the point. If you run point, you are the point guard."
Is Kemba a better point guard than Kyrie Irving?
"My problem with this is that all players are role players, the difference between stars and non-stars isn't what role you fill, but how much value you provide in a role. Playmaking is a role, Lebron is just ridiculously good at it and provides even more value in other roles too, making him the best overall role player.  If you just mean ""role player"" as in ""not a star,"" then it's more about where you cut the line between stars and non-stars. That's just asking for hot takes like people saying Kyrie Irving isn't a star because he's never elevated a bad team to the playoffs or something like that though."
He had one bad game against Delly. You’re not going to convince me Steph performs worse in 2015 on offense if Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving are getting 30 mins a game a each and getting dragged into actions over and over again
"He embarrassed Kyrie so many times, especially in those pre-Lebron-return years  Had to dig this up from way back syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2274294-there-is-no-comparing-john-wall-and-kyrie-irving-anymore.amp.html"
"Lol. They were bad defensively because they were starting Kyrie Irving, Lebron, JR Smith and Kevin Love. They were still 11th in defensive rating out of playoff teams. You should go back and watch those playoffs because they were horrible defensively. Their defensive rating in the playoffs was worse than their defensive rating in the regular season.   Those Finals games could’ve been a whole lot closer if they had just focused more on their defence. Their were possessions where they weren’t even trying, they just left guys open. Even when Klay, Curry and KD weren’t all on the floor together."
"I do think they are having an off year, but I also think everyone is overreacting a bit. They still made 3 of the last 4 conference finals and have a solid young duo in Brown/Tatum and some good young pieces in Smart, Timelord, Prichard that could be a solid supporting cast. I do think they also had a lot of really weird scenarios.  Let's talk about Terry first. The consensus was Terry was a 6th man guy at best and there were a lot of rumors about locker room issues with him. He seemed to be a big factor in a lot of the issues during that last Irving season so I'm not surprised they moved him. They got back Kemba in return for basically a swap of the two. Seemed like a good move at the time. Terry is playing pretty well this season but it just feels tough to blame the Cs on that one.  Let's now talk about Kyrie. This one is a mess. I think you could argue the Cs fucked up here a bit by not dumping him when they knew he was going to walk. They were not playing as well in the 18-19 season and it was clear Kyrie wasn't working. However it does seem like Tatum and a few other guys really liked their time with him, so there was a chance they were just trying to ride it out. However they ultimately lost Kyrie for nothing, however given they didn't sell a whole lot to get him :shrug:. I do think this situation could have been handled better.  Horford, man that shit was just ridiculous. The 76ers literally gave him one of the worst contracts in basketball. I can't even blame them for that. I'm sure they would have kept Horford on something cheaper, but I don't think they assumed the 76ers were gonna do what they did.   Hayward, I give a bit less of a pass on. Hayward had a player option, and the Cs had been trying to shop him. Danny I think got a bit too greedy behind the scenes and I think believe Hayward wouldn't walk on his own. That was a mess up there, I think they had to move Hayward as their 2-3 rotation was just clogged down, but they needed to secure something for him.   The picks, absolute disaster, a team trying to win needs to move all those damn extra picks that was stupid.  That being said, I still don't think they are totally lost. They have two potential superstars in Brown and Tatum. Timelord looks like he is working his way to becoming an elite defensive anchor. Smart is a 6 man teams would die for, with his hustle, shooting, defense and playmaking. It's a rough year, but it's a strange shortened season, they've dealt with a lot of injuries, Tatum is still overcoming COVID etc. I don't think they are on that much of a downward spiral. Maybe I believe a bit more in Tatum and Brown than others, but I think this team will be fine next year. I think they'll probably swap coaches before they blow it up."
"But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys. Please explain to me who we could have traded those picks to and when to replace the production of Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, and Al Horford. And please tell me which salaries are coming along for the ride to make the deals work."
You acting like warriors fans didn’t say this exact thing even though the warriors recruited him after they couldn’t beat bron when kyrie Irving was playing
Watch LeBron James or Kyrie Irving
"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I’m not sure where the number four comes from?"
"It must be nice to not have to ever worry about hitting a draft pick.   Just trade away 5 years worth of picks for a couple of late 30's stars that ends up going down as the worst trade ever, then casually sign Kyrie Irving &amp; Kevin Durant in free agency a couple years later. Then give the Rockets hardly any value for James Harden because their owner refuses to trade with Daryl Morey."
Kyrie Irving who didn’t make the playoffs before LeBron and Kevin Love who disappeared in the finals = teaming up with a 73-9 team that has multiple hall of famers and the reigning league MVP  Why would LeBron try to stack the deck against a team he just humiliated in the finals?
Gtfoh. You act like Lebron didn’t joined a team with Kyrie Irving and draft assets to trade for Kevin Love. Lebron tried to stack the deck too but the Warriors played the game better
"Yeah, I'm sure teams were dying to sign a guy who has the unmitigated gall to iso and jack up terrible shots with KD and Kyrie Irving on the floor."
"Joe ""Just a Shooter"" Harris with 6 assists and really good defense  Nets with 7 out of 8 players scoring double digits, none of which were Kyrie Irving lol  I love Jeff Green so much, if we win a ring he will damn sure have earned his"
In a game with Kevin Durant kyrie Irving Kyle Lowry siakam and ffv MIKE JAMES was the guy who took over in the 4th.   I don’t wanna see the raps ever again gg
"If I were to make a top ten of most skilled players of all time, the list would include players like Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving, Steph Curry, Larry Bird, Isaiah Thomas, Jerry West, Jason Williams, Sweet Lou and J Crawford. I wouldn't put Manu on that list.   But I could agree with Manu as the best sixth man followed by Crawford, Lou and Tony K."
Or Kyrie Irving for an injured Isaiah Thomas.
"Taller Kyrie Irving is his absolute ceiling. His finishing and handles are already ridiculous, and his shooting and playmaking are getting to really good levels too."
What assets did the Heat have besides a declining Wade and a Chris Bosh who eventually got blood clots? I don't blame the Cavs mismanagement of Kyrie Irving considering who he is and the rise of the KD Warriors that denied the Cavs at least one more ring. And I highly doubt the Cavs two years from now are going to be in a better position than the Heat pre-Butler.

Maybe because Lebron and Kyrie were the better players who were more important in winning a championship than Love. Why the fuck would you want Kevin Love taking more shots when you have Lebron and Kyrie Irving

Bruh we hate Kyrie cause he’s a moron. Well just me   Mr Flat earther my big toe Hurts so I can’t play until March madness so I can score 20ppg and not give a shit about winning the tourney Irving

"If the Nets lose and Kyrie has a bad game, we're gonna get to hear another compelling story after from Kyrie Irving about Kyrie the mythic hero overcoming the monsters set on him by the goblin prince."
"Well Tatum just has too big of a scoring load now. Kemba just hasn’t panned out for us and they don’t have scoring beyond that. Not to mention they’re facing KD, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving."
Is it? KD left in free agency.   Harden failed to show up to his team's training camp and instead was attending strip clubs during a global pandemic. He then proceeded to mail it in the first few weeks of the season and then forced his way out after getting bitched by the Lakers two games in a row. To top it all off his former team got next to nothing for him in the trade because he only wanted to go to a team with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.   The Rockets gave Harden everything he wanted. Morey was the most aggressive GM in the league during Harden's time there.   KD gave OKC 8 elite seasons before bolting.  Harden gave Houston 8 elite seasons before bolting.   Not sure how anyone can argue that what KD did was worse lol
6ft9 270 lbs 36 year old man dribbling and finishing like Kyrie Irving is absolutely nothing to be astonished by!
All he can do effectively in this series is drop***   Switching Brook Lopez onto Kyrie Irving or James Harden is instant death. They can probably switch 1-4 in that series but Lopez switching onto any of their stars is just asking to get curb stomped.

"&gt; One. Nobody is denying that Boston has a racism problem  [Except for the GM himself...?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2021/05/27/danny-ainge-responds-to-kyrie-irving-i-never-heard-that-from-celtics-players-in-my-26-years-in-boston/amp/) He literally said “as far as I’m concerned, it doesn’t matter.”  Also bringing up the plight of Celtics fans “being attacked 24/7” when having a conversation about racism is like the definition of whattaboutism."
&gt; But Kyrie Irving won't be booed because he's a black man tomorrow. Kyrie Irving will be booed because he treated a fan base like shit  He wasn't talking about being booed lol
"Paul Pierce was a cold blooded killer, I'm just glad the Celtics never had to face him in his prime haha. He did that shit to everyone. But yeah, a lot of young talent throughout the league right now, and this Knicks team came out of nowhere, so you guys will be in the mix now too. Any team that joins the fight to take down Brooklyn and Kyrie fucking Irving is an ally in my book, even if it's temporary!"
After you got fans throwing popcorn and fans spitting on players in the last day alone you think it’s dumb for Kyrie Irving to say let’s not be racist to a fanbase that’s known for being racist?...
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."
"I know it's not the same anymore since they left, but the Nets do treat Jersey players as the hometown kids  When Kyrie Irving is introduced in the starting lineup, it's ""From Duke University by way of West Orange, New Jersey...""  Although I think Isaiah Whitehead had some special recognition when he started for the Nets a few years ago, doubly special given he was both an alum for Lincoln HS in Brooklyn and Seton Hall University in NJ"
Joel embiid possessed by the spirit of kyrie irving

"Stupid argument because you are talking about player defense vs team defense.  Only two teams with a defense outside of the top 10 has ever won a ring.  And your DPOY argument is beyond moronic.  No one said DPOY = rings.  But being great at defense does.  GOAT list - MJ, LBJ, Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Wilt, Kareem, Bird, Moses, Dr J, Hakeem, etc etc etc - have all been named to NBA all defensive teams.  Rudy Gobert or Jokic? Neither have a ring and neither are getting one this year so whats your point?  Both are young enough to still win multiple.    Marcus Smart or Kyrie Irving?  Lebron got Kyrie his ring.  Lebron is first defensive team player.  Ben Simmons or Devon Booker?  Neither have a ring, but Simmons is more likely to get his this year than Booker is.  Tony Allen or Allen Iverson?  AI never got a ring.  Ben Simmons or Luka?  Neither have a ring, but Ben is in a better position to get his this year than Luka is.  Michael Cooper or Magic?  Magic and he was first defensive team... dafaq you smoking on this one nephew?  Bruce Bowen or Steve Nash?  Nash - no ring.  Dennis Rodman or Charles Barkley? No rings vs 2.  Ben Wallace or Dirk?  Obviously dirk, but why this comparison?  Dirk wasn't a Center."
"As someone who grew up around the area, there are plenty of racists in Boston. I’m not one of those Boston fans who will claim Boston isn’t a racist city. But the idea that Celtics fans hate Kyrie Irving for any reason other than him being Kyrie Irving is laughable. He lied to the fans, betrayed the city, said the dumbest shit imaginable in his media appearances, and gave up on his team multiple times including in a winnable playoff series. Because he is who he is, the Celtics consistently played better when Kyrie was hurt than when he was healthy. That’s why none of us like him. Now he’s trying to frame it as a race issue so he can look like the victim in the situation lmao. Dude made his decision and I don’t fault him for it. I was happy to see him leave for all the aforementioned reasons. But let’s not act like Boston is the only city where people would react negatively to his return. Shit, look at IT. We all still want him to come home. Why? Because he gave more effort and showed more heart in any given game than Kyrie showed in his entire time in Boston."
"This is a mostly subjective arguement. KD will go down as one of the most skilled scorers in the game of basketball, Top - 20 all time guaranteed.   Now, a three peat is a different dimension all together so let's just say he wins two or three titles in BKN w/ FMVP atleast twice. This should, on paper, make him move up in the rankings considerably to atleast top 10.  This should theoretically put him in the pantheon of the players who were legendary at their position like Bird or Duncan.  However historical context is definitely important in terms of the legacy arguement. Pure stats alone shouldn't determine the all-time rankings. One should take into account that for most , if not all, of these title runs , Durant had the best supporting cast ever consisting of transcendent players who themselves are atleast top 30, like Steph Curry /James Harden (?) and players who were elite in the roles they played like Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/ Kyrie Irving. Not to mention that the there were almost no teams in the NBA even remotely close to being as good as the GSW dynasty (We'll see how BKN does). So it must take a bit away from KD's personal role on these rings. Don't get me wrong, he was still the best player on these legendary teams, but we should look at the bigger picture here."
&gt;he experienced racism  https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2019/03/kyrie-irving-says-he-hasnt-experienced-racism-in-boston-but-hearing-about-it-its-a-little-saddening.html  not in boston according to... kyrie irving
I’m predicting a “YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE RACIST TO HATE KYRIE IRVING” sign
"No, him being a little chubby and slow means unatheltic to me. He is not Kyrie Irving. He is not even Facu Campazzo; he is exactly what I said: unatheltic. Has nothing to do with his race."
It's the truth. Kyrie Irving is better
"Yeah, too bad he was on such a shitty team with Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris Lavert, Joe Harris, and Jarrett Allen. That team already had a good shot of winning the title but Durant can't help but always take the easiest way possible."
"Miami Heat: Dwyane Wade (13x All-Star, 1x Finals MVP, 8x All-NBA, 3x All-Defensive, 1x Scoring Champion) and Chris Bosh (11x All-Star, 1x All-NBA, HoF 2021)  Cleveland Cavaliers: Kyrie Irving (7x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, 50-40-90 club) and Kevin Love (5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, NBA MIP, 1x Rebounding Champion)  For almost all of the series with that heat team, Dwyane Wade would have been the best player on the court without LeBron. Some series Chris Bosh would have been the best behind them too. Kyrie would have been the second best player in the Atlanta series and the Detroit series in 2016. Kevin Love was also better than anyone on Detroit and probably Atlanta too. DeMar DeRozan was incredible in 2016 but although he was considered ahead of Kyrie, it's not open and shut 100%. so there's an argument that LeBron's team still had the best player on the court without him all the way until they faced Curry in the finals  He's LeGM for a reason"
Maybe a Kyrie Irving celling. It kinda looks like Luka is a generational talent though. Still way to early to tell. It took Steph a few years to become what he is today.
"Mate I’m not saying that you’re calling me a racist, I’m just saying that Kyrie has no reason to bring up racial harassment at the garden when he said he’d never witnessed it one of the last weeks of his life that he’s been at the garden: https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2019/03/kyrie-irving-says-he-hasnt-experienced-racism-in-boston-but-hearing-about-it-its-a-little-saddening.html?outputType=amp   It’s his first time back, so it’s disappointing to see him trying to get ahead of the narrative when he KNOWS he’s gonna get boo’d and harassed. Respect to Kyrie for knowing how to work the media, perhaps they are pawns after all 😂😂, but that’s the gist of what I’m saying. Hate the guy and wish and I could be there to boo him too 🥰"
Yeah I’m sure you’d love to follow the Kyrie Irving Show with no MVPs anywhere on the horizon....
"Boston being racist and Kyrie Irving being a clown are not mutually exclusive, both can be and are true."
You heard it here folks in this god/Allah/tree spirit given flat earth there is only one place that's racist and that's Boston and that's the only reason they hate Kyrie Irving not because of promises and under performing no it's racism
"Dennis ""Kyrie Irving"" Schroder"
Kyrie Irving calls 100% Democrat politician city Boston a racist city..:
"I know that nobody gives a fuck, but for those keeping track, Kyrie Irving is yet to lose a first round playoff GAME in his career, he is a perfect 18-0 in playoff first round games, i wonder if anyone is even close to a start like that."
"a better player cant join a lesser player? there is a reason kd was the one winning the finals mvps when they were together. and just to quote kerr.Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."" also he once said “I would say Kevin (Durant) is ... when you factor in everything, size, speed, athleticism, I think he’s the most talented basketball player I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kerr said.  “It was more just a level of basketball that I’m not sure had ever been reached before.”"
"Kyrie Irving grew up as a Nets fan. I think he's happy now and great for him.  And yes, no love for the Nets."
Kevin “I want to win on my own” Durant  Kyrie “I plan on resigning with Boston” Irving  James “Houston is my city” Harden  Blake “I can’t dunk anymore” Griffen  ^this should sum up my thoughts on these players in particular
Steve “Kyrie ‘Kevin Durant’ Irving” Kerr
"""Ayo Harden, Im getting Lavert, Allen outta here, I'll see you soon!""- KD  ""Bet, I'll come outta shape and lazy so it's easier to trade for me""- Harden  ""I'll make the fans think i can't dunk anymore and pistons will buy me out and I'll join you guys!""- Blake Griffin  ""----------""- Kyrie Irving"
"The game is being commentated by Marv Albert and Grant Hill, Marv of course who is retiring, in the 3re quarter Marcus Smart has just made made a sequence of 3's, Kyrie made a 3 of his own, kyrie comes down the court and is being guarded by Nesmith, Marcus smart is guarding someone in the corner, Marv says something along the lines of ""Here comes Kyrie Irving, guarded by Marcus Smart."" This doesn't really relate, but I thought it was funny"
Kevin “I want to win on my own” Durant  Kyrie “I plan on resigning with Boston” Irving  James “Houston is my city” Harden  Blake “I can’t dunk anymore” Griffen
"Imagine telling someone a few years ago that one day James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Blake Griffin would all be in the same line-up... and Joe Harris would outplay them all."
"Kyrie Irving, first team All-NBA hairiest armpits"
Imagine double teaming James Harden so he passes to KD who then kicks it to Joe Harris. Personally I’d just kill myself. Meanwhile Kyrie Irving is resting on the bench getting ready to check in.
"Welp I’ve seen enough, see you guys at 10pm to watch the lakers lose. Fuck Kevin Durant and fuck kyrie Irving"
Have we got one mention of Tristan Thompson and Kyrie Irving being on a championship team together yet or being drafted the same year by the same team?
"weird, i got the correct definition:  am·phib·i·ous  /amˈfibēəs/  adjective  able to use both hands equally well:  ""Kyrie Irving is amphibious"""

"Jimmy ""2019 Kyrie Irving"" Butler"
Lebron James and kyrie Irving existed
"""What do socks mean to you?"" - Kyrie Irving, probably"
The Kyrie Irving effect
"Normally I'd agree but a team that has KD and James Harden on it is gonna be considered one of the favorites, add Kyrie Irving and you'd be trippin to not think they are the clear favorites."
"Is this a joke lol. What did we do beside draft, sign, and trade for good players, make 5 finals, and win a ring? Lebron came back because we could surround him with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and good to great role players. Sorry we can’t all pass up the chance to avoid drafting a generational talent like Luka after tasting cavs ass for 2 decades like the hawks."

"&gt;It doesn’t matter if the event was distanced, tested, or required a full colonoscopy and endoscopy before attending.  Actually it does fucking matter. Alot. If what has been reported is true that:  1. The Party was outdoors (confirmed) 2. All guests at the party were to be vacinated and PCR tested (confirmed)  Then, there is quite literally ZERO reason to be mad, in fact the likelihood of a spreader event in such an enviroment is close to null. There is a reason why the government has lifted the mask regulation for those vaccinated both INSIDE and OUTSIDE at this period in time.  Lou William, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden all attended completely packed indoor clubs BEFORE the vaccines were rolled out. Furthermore, Kyrie Irving's party didn't even bother to PCR test, making it entirely understandable why there is a discrepency in the punishment.  Any reasonable person with 1 goddamn braincell could make the assertion that LeBron's attendance was extremely low risk, and thus shouldn't be held liable to the same standards of carelessness exhibited by Harden during the height of the pandemic."
Kyrie ‘the catalyst’ Irving
"Pippen was a top player in the league for like 5 years before injuries caught up to him, before that he still had a lot to prove getting manhandled in those Detroit series and before THAT he was a developing young player who had small minutes  Jordan was winning MVPs and DPOY long before Pippen got there, you can’t seriously convince us one Scottie Pippen = D Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Anthony Davis without sounding like a fanboy"
POV: you're Kyrie Irving and everyone is looking at you after reading this comment
Mom can we have Kyrie Irving?  We have Kyrie Irving at home.  Kyrie Irving at home:
Kyrie Irving was in Boston when Lebron went to the finals in 2018. Also K Love was a reserve that year.
I mean Kevin love was an all star player and he did have Kyrie Irving. Lmao like why pretend that he was carrying bums.
"I remember there was one Nets game where Kyrie Irving literally ran his elbow right through Sexton, which was called a foul at first but then challeneged and somehow successfully overturned. If the situation was the other way around, Sexton would've been called for a flagrant."
"I was saying, when Kyrie got to the line they chanted “KYRIE IRVING” lmfaooo"
"why? Don't get me wrong I'm A knick fan so obviously don't like the nets(don't really hate them or anything just meh), but I like Kyrie Irving,  I also tend to like NBA players who /r/nba hates(except Lebron, I'm still bitter about that flop on tyson chandler and the whole heatles thing)."
Kyrie Irving lost like $800k in pay and missed 2 weeks because he went to his sister's birthday party
"Been saying this, KD/Kyrie/Harden on the same team is crazy  Irving has the ball, drives to the basket but the opponent stops his drive so he dishes it out to Harden, defense scrambles but get a good close out so Harden passes it to an open Kevin FUCKING Durant   Bruh…"
Kai Irving! Put some respect on that man's name! I don't wanna hear none of that disrespect on Kyrie from the /r/nba nephews here again!!
Kemba Walker is the Mad Catz controller version of Kyrie Irving.
"Couldn't have traded for Anthony Davis with Kyrie Irving on the team and he wasn't interested in playing for the Celtics, a team with Anthony Davis and essentially nobody else (because Brown/Tatum+Smart would be gone) would get nowhere.   Kawhi Leonard is the only one that I think is maybe possible, but that's just hindsight bias. It took a lot of things lining up just right for the Raptors to win - KD getting injured, Klay getting injured, etc. Also he left anyways and if just one of KD/Klay weren't injured things would be different. Also they didn't really have to give up anything for Kawhi, just Derozan and a first round pick. Spurs wanted Brown and Smart from us and if things went differently that would look like one of the dumbest trades of all time (losing Brown/Smart for nothing and having Kawhi leave afterwards with no championship to show for it.)"
"I am in the ""Kyrie Irving is overrated camp"" but damn Kyrie is so much better than Kemba it's not even funny"
Kyrie Irving in the garden is all we have to look forward to this series
"Lillard and Irving aren’t even negative on defense at their position, like I said, you’re just really underrating Dame and Kyrie my dude."
Kyrie Irving is a glorified Evan Fournier
Imagine thinking KYRIE Irving was better than marcus smart what
When he met Kyrie Irving
"lol @ announcers saying all of the nets big three has tremendous basketball IQ  Kyrie ""I won't shoot 8/22 from the field again"" Irving lmao"
It’s Kyrie Irving. Only one who can slow him down is a NASA curvature specialist.
"""I am absolute."" ~~Akashi Seijuro~~ Kyrie Irving"
"Nets starting lineup: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin  💀"
"I never said he wasn’t the best player on that team, but you’re acting like he carried that team which is extremely untrue. That was a team win if there’s ever been a team win. FVV bailed his ass out a few times with clutch ass 3s and good rough defense on Steph. That year the Warriors sacrificed depth for an unbeatable starting 5, losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson is NOT comparable to losing Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. Especially when there’s no depth because you have 4 stars eating up cap space."
Kyrie irving. Please ima need a 40 ball.
"Time for the Nets, led by Kyrie Irving, to begin their path to a title. He has a great #2 and #3 in James Harden and Kevin Durant."
Lmaaao the 8th pick landed kyrie freaking Irving for the Celtics back when Cavs and Celtics made that trade lmao you guys are acting like if siakam is Anthony Davis or something lol
"LeBron James is only in the GOAT conversation because of Ray Allen, Kyrie Irving, and that man right there."

Mike Breen: “Tucker now yelling at Kyrie Irving”  No he was yelling at that stupid ass security guard for hockey checking him.
12% is very unlikely. 3.1% is significantly more unlikely than *that*. You're the goofy mf who tried to argue that Joe Harris and Bryn Forbes having poor shooting nights is somehow equivalent. It's clearly more rare for Harris to shoot this badly than for Forbes.  Also lmfao hold up you want me to check on the low chances for the Bucks to shoot badly because you think it *helps* your point  Do you see the roster of the other team? Are you aware of who you're playing against? Like the Bucks are a good shooting team that had a poor shooting night but that's Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving out there. You think it's more likely for them to shoot this badly? Okay buddy
Reggie Kyrie Irving Jackson
"Kyrie Irving says something dumb every so often, but the media and fans just stay dragging this man for the smallest of things."
"I mean, we can discuss hypotheticals all day but when it's all said and done, Bruce Brown should not be tasked with the game winning shot when Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, or even Blake Griffin are on the floor.  Not discrediting the defense but this was not a smart play on offense."
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
&gt;yeah im sure 2x champion 2x FMVP Kevin Durant and NBA Champion Kyrie Irving will take games for granted  It was not these guys who would be affected but the role players who would be
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"Understand that most are upset about Bruce taking that shot.  But, With all the spotlight on Durant, I was secretly hoping that Nash will let Kyrie take the last shot. Remember when Kerr used Damien lee and Poole as surprises .. may be worth the shot especially when it is Kyrie fucking Irving!"
"hard to screw up a play more than bruce brown did with 11 seconds left.  drops the pass, runs into kyrie instead of letting him have it, and then decides it's all on him even though there's still 8 seconds left and kevin durant and kyrie irving on the floor.  that means his brain just exploded in a big moment and he panicked."
"You got Kyrie Irving and KD on the outside who are some of the best shooters to ever live especially KD, Blake Griffin on the inside, and for some reason Brown who refused to shoot all night ignores KD and Kyrie and drives past Griffin and throws the ball on top of the backboard."
This man Bruce brown has Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on his team and tries to play hero ball LOL
Why not Kyrie Irving?
"Imagine needing a clutch bucket, having Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the floor....  And Bruce Brown takes the shot"
you have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the floor and somehow Bruce Brown took more shots than them in the final 4 minutes.
Fuck Bud run a set for the love of god we shouldn’t be running more ISOs than a team with fucking Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
How does Kyrie Irving do what he does with the ball. It’s like the hips and knees coordinate with the handles
Kyrie. Irving.
KYRIE IRVING OMG
"Goober would have the advantage of surprise, and maybe Kyrie would be startled, looking for security, trying to hear a whistle, and miss the layup or even get blocked.  On the other hand it's Kyrie Irving."
Wtf is Kyrie Irving going to do? I wanna see him really get into it one day cause I don’t think he’s dropped anyone in his life
"# ""CAN YOU BELIEVE THE BRILLIANCE OF KYRIE IRVING?? HE LOOKED UP AT THE SHOT CLOCK AND THEN SHOT IT!"""
KYRIE IRVING
I want to strangle Giannis. He’s jacking up more 3s than Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.  I’m honestly starting to think he’s a fraud.
It’s one thing to get beat by Kevin fucking Durant or Kyrie Irving   Imagine getting beat by a 6’4 dude with two first names playing Center lmao
Lol someone said the same thing you said when a 2K report said Kyrie Irving was taking more PTO to ponder the mysteries of the world
"I was having a nice nap on my couch during the 1st quarter of the Bucks, Nets game when I was suddenly awoken by gunshots on my television! I was confused at first but then I realized that the noise was just KYRIE IRVING bricks bouncing off the rim! Keep it down UNCLE DREW !"
"Kyrie Irving looks like Alton from Snowfall.   Thank you, I'll see my way out."
"I loathe Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. I think they're both pathetic borderline deplorable human beings and I hope the Nets lose, but with that being said, they're both so god damn smooth and fun to watch the basketball purist in me finds it hard to realllly hate them. Conflicting emotions"
Who are you gonna leave open lol Kyrie Irving or the 48% 3 point shooter  Also Mike James and Blake are very capable of knocking down an open 3 or driving to the rim with lots of space
&gt;Bud has has time to adjust to the Nets offense  goodluck with that  &gt;The nets will not take game 3 as serious as the Bucks will  yeah im sure 2x champion 2x FMVP Kevin Durant and NBA Champion Kyrie Irving will take games for granted
completely helps that Joe Harris and Kyrie Irving are part of the 50-40-90
"I mean he had 34 or on 34 minutes and 16/24 shooting on GM1 and everybody completely forgot. What makes you think that playing great on GM3 would matter if they also lose?  If he repeats his GM1 performance people would simply ignore it. If he plays like GM2 only then would people take wind of (it).  No! he needs to win. If he doesn't then people would clown him regardless of his individual games. Remember Kawhi back when the Clippers were 0-2 to the Mavs? People couldn't care less of Kawhi's individual performance.  That is exactly why KD, Harden and Irving actually formed a superteam. They got tired being called losers (KD in OKC days, Harden in Houston, Kyrie supposededly being under Lebron's shadow or whatever).  The *media* (popular or social) build superteams, not the players. The players merely do what is needed so that to not be be remembered as chockers/losers/w/e...  The fans' attitude literally form the NBA of current."
Kyrie Andrew Irving = KAI
"I've never seen a better scorer than KD. He's legitimately a 7 foot Kyrie Irving. He can shoot over you but if you stick him, he can dribble right past you. He can hit floaters, step-backs, pullups shots, and if you foul him, he's a 90% free throw shooter. And coming off a damn achilles injury? Jesus Christ."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"“ is Chris Paul in your top 15 point guards of all time list.” Did they seriously mention bob cousey, Kyrie Irving and Tony Parker and leave off Chris Paul, John Stockton and JKidd? 🤦‍♂️"
"I'm probably one of Giannis' biggest defenders here and I'm getting irritated at how people are trying to give him a pass because his statline looks okay. The Bucks need him to dominate the paint in order to have any sort of chance and instead he's trying to trade jumpers with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in the first quarter. I've even seen someone say ""well maybe Middleton should attack the rim more and create easier looks"" as a way of giving Giannis a pass for his broken approach to the game"
Kyrie Irving. I don’t always agree with things he says or does but I’ll keep riding with him as long as he’s not hurting anyone lol
"I enjoyed it.  Here's my favorite part when describing the Big 3 and how unfair it seems on paper:  The Nets’ Big 3 are almost comically different, physically and spiritually and stylistically. It’s like the opening screen of a video game in which you have to choose your character, each of whom comes with a different set of pros and cons. Do you want the tiny quicksilver thief (Kyrie Irving) or the burly crafty woodsman (James Harden) or the tall ethereal phantom (Kevin Durant)? Choose carefully — your survival depends on it. Somehow, Brooklyn figured out the cheat code that allows you to pick all three."
Kyrie Irving because he is without a doubt the most skilled player ever with the basketball.
"&gt; I always think the key to any championship team is a top 10 offense and top 10 defense.  I mean if that's true the Jazz should be a lock. Top 5 offense and top 5 defense, only team in the NBA that's top 5 at both.  But realistically despite how horrible their defense has been on the season the Nets should be considered a heavy title favorite because *they have 2 of the best 5 players in the entire NBA*, oh yeah and also Kyrie Irving, and a bunch of solid role players like... Blake Griffin with his time machine. Nobody else in the league really matches up to just how much sheer fucking talent the Nets have, and in particular their experience in bigtime games and clutch moments."
Kyrie Irving
Was that Kyrie Irving just now??
worth noting Kyrie was also [on the table](https://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/Rockets-Nets-James-Harden-trade-Kyrie-Irving-picks-15867405.php) and the Rockets still chose picks
"Bruh..what are you smoking lol did you just started watching the NBA this year? Kyrie was drafted in 2011 while lebron was in Miami. He was there for 3 years without lebron. In those 3 years he probably felt he had the keys to the franchise, especially after he got his multimillion dollar extension. There was reports around that time that he wanted Gordon Hayward to play with him in Cleveland. Obviously when the best player in the league comes back to play for his hometown team it's gonna take some of the limelight off of the other guy.   https://sports.yahoo.com/report-kyrie-irving-never-really-wanted-lebron-come-back-cavs-heat-2014-213102651.html Here's a source."
"Facts. It’s always “Kyrie wanted out”, but nobody ever mentions [CLE trying to ship him to PHX..](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2729572-kyrie-irving-reportedly-nearly-traded-to-suns-in-3-team-paul-george-deal)"
"&gt;That’s where my comment came from. Nets quickly dispatched of them  ...Because the Celtics were hobbled and offensively challenged, and don't have two offensive playmakers like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant to step up when their second leading scorer goes down. You've decided this is irrelevant.  &gt;Also, Nets best defensive games, thus far, have came against the Bucks  lol do you think the fact the Bucks were down by 50 at one point in one of the two games they've played might have had anything to do with their overall level of effort?  ...Nah, I guess not. A sample size of two games is plenty, after all.  &gt;Uhh...cause they are. Both this season and the bubble season aren’t remotely comparable.  lmao, so if Brooklyn is supposed to be some kind of an exception, then you can't use the fact that lots of other contending teams don't try in the regular season as precedent for the Nets. You can't have it both ways. Either the Nets are their own beast, in which case you can't point to previous teams as proof you can flip a switch in the playoffs; or they're not, and the Nets are underperforming the last decade's worth of title contenders. Pick one, and pick only one.  &gt;You have yet to dispute one single argument I made  Because what you're saying is unfalsifiable. You're ignoring the fact you're working with a sample size of 7 games and somehow saying that these 7 games are more meaningful than the 72 games played before that. I've pointed to precedent that ignoring the regular season isn't valid, and you dismiss that. I've pointed out that there are meaningful confounding variables affecting the 7 games the Nets have played in the postseason, and you dismiss that. Clearly, all you want to do is tell yourself you're right, without any regard to why you can't come to that conclusion yet.  It's not my fault you've never taken a stats course beyond high school."
"“With the help of Kyrie Irving, a top 15 player in the league.”"
[The Real Kyrie Irving](https://youtu.be/MYGw2_TNSTo?t=2922)
"This is it. And it all started from Kyrie Irving requesting a trade from Cleveland. Any GM worth his salt would at the very least look into what they could give for a generational talent, and most would try to make a trade happen.  So Danny did, I think (and this statement is just speculation on my part) before he had known what he had in Jaylen and Jayson. Now you've got Kyrie Irving and Al Horford on your team. You are going to try and compete.  When, in my opinion and with the obvious benefit of hindsight, the best move from the jump would have been to officially enter a rebuilding stage around the Jays. But the front office didn't know what the Jay's would become, and they were always told that ""We compete every year."" So the Celtics overstretched themselves and tried to go all the way every season since 2018 without realizing that their real centerpieces were those two kids they just drafted.  That led to mediocre performances and growing pains that manifested themselves as locker room issues and of course, the max-players and free-agents are going to take the brunt of the pain, both in terms of their performance and the blame from the media/fans.  That's my opinion on the Celtics struggles since 2018. Trying to pin this on any given player or individual is missing the bigger picture. The overarching problem is that we tried to compete when we should have been developing and if you play like that then every year when you should be ""winning it all"" is going to be a disappointment, and someone is always going to be blamed."
"All made up narratives. Kyrie was the problem for most players.   Horford went on record saying if he knew Kemba was coming, his decision would probably be different.  ""As far as on the court, it’s certain Horford wasn’t interested in playing another hand from the same deck. I asked him if his decision would have been different if Irving had remained.""  &gt;“I’m not sure that has anything to do with it for me,” Horford said. “I just think that if Kyrie would have stayed, I don’t know if it would have worked. There would have had to be some major changes as far as players, because it was just clear that the group that we had just wasn’t going to be able to coexist.”  &gt;And what about if he’d known Kemba Walker was coming. Horford paused.  &gt;“I don’t want to get caught up in the past,” he said, “but, yeah, that would have been totally different.”  Haywards comments  &gt;“I have no regrets about anything that happened in Boston, and I really appreciate all the fan support — for supporting me through a wild ride of ups and downs,” Hayward said in a wide-ranging interview with The Athletic’s Sam Amick.  ""Hayward — who said he doesn’t keep in touch with Irving, aside from saying hello at games — explained that the way things played out is not really anybody’s fault.""  &gt;“It’s unfortunate what happened because I don’t think we ever really got a chance to be the tandem that we wanted to be. I got injured right away, and then he got injured. Now, I’m trying to come back. We just didn’t get a chance for it to take off,” Hayward said. “Like I said earlier, I loved my time in Boston, the relationships I built. No regrets.”"

"**Milwaukee Bucks**  With Harden out, Jrue can really focus on Kyrie Irving   There’s no stopping KD, but Tucker and Middleton can at least slow him down. Not to mention DPOY Giannis   Offensively, Giannis going to feast on the Nets. They have no real rim protection. Who are they going put on him? Blake Griffin lol  Harden’s the engine of this Nets team, with him out its 60/40 Bucks imo"

"Tatum couldn't beat Milwaukee with Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart and Al Horford, with Brad Stevens as a coach. Cope how you want, Embiid is better. OH, and Luka will ALWAYS be a better player than Trash Young."
"Embiid couldn't beat Kawhi in the 2nd round with Jimmy Butler, Tobias, Covington, Reddick, and Simmons  Tatum took LeBron to 7 games in his rookie year with Hayward and Kyrie Irving out for the series. and he beat the sixers 4-1 his rookie year and swept Embiid last year.  Cope how you want but Tatum is clearly better."
Kyrie Irving is a top-25 class player and has been since 2015. DWade was a top-10 class player and AD is a top-10 class player. Also Chris Bosh was a top-15 class player who toned down his game for MIA.   IMO  Wade = AD  &gt; Bosh &gt; Kyrie.
"And then he had [the 7th worst playoff game](https://stathead.com/tiny/EPVuv) in the last 5 years, thanks to a nobody who looked like a part-time accountant.  It would be the equivalent of, idk, Luke Kennard inducing a 2/16 shooting night out of Kyrie Irving in an elimination game. You don't really care how well Kyrie did in the early games of the series; if a balding dork shuts down someone who has the reputation of one of the best 5 players in the league, it's funny, it's memorable, and you rag on that top 5 player for being shitty against someone that they by all rights should have absolutely owned."

Westbrook and Kyrie Irving
"Hardens average TS% is higher than Irving for regular season and playoffs. Harden averaged 2.3 less points than Irving on 3.4 less shots. While he was able to get to the line 7.3 times a game compared to Kyrie who only attempted 4. His TS% was 61.9% compared to Kyries 61.4 this year, and was at 76% in the first round compared to Kyrie being 60.4.   Harden was more efficient than Kyrie and actually handled the playmaking duties. It speaks for itself that Harden consistently carried a franchise for 8 years to 50 win seasons in the west and likely would’ve won in 17-18 if CP3 didn’t get hurt. Kyrie has never lead a team in the playoffs. He’s always been number 2 to players like KD and LeBron. The one time he lead a team to the playoffs he was embarrassed in 18-19."
"I’m not sure what you were watching but they certainly let Curry play 1 on 1 for the majority of the series . You’d think if he were getting doubled and tripled curry could get above 7 assist especially during those finals games when it matters most but nope not even with the amazing shooters he played with. Even if the Cavs were playing let’s focus on Curry and Curry only who’s going to stop him Kyrie Irving , jr Smith , Kevin Love ? Stop it ! As I stated Shaun Livingston played much better when Curry was off the floor , not next to curry but when curry was on the bench . For those games Curry had an average plus minus of -5 , he was hurting his team more than helping them. I’m using stats because what else am I going to use to prove he isn’t unguardable… he’s getting shut down by Delly a nobody and Irving a below average defender! imagine he played in a more physical era where guys like Gary Payton and Dennis Johnson could hound him the second he crosses the half court line . Curry has some major flaws all together especially on the defensive side of the ball but that’s a story for another day . I’m just sick of people overstating how great he is when he couldn’t even lead his team to the playoffs this season …. Yet people were calling for him to win the mvp ? absolutely delusional thoughts by fan boys. To make matters worse people try disrespecting the true all time great players by saying Curry is a top 10 player of all time , someone needs to stop the madness because 7 prime years doesn’t get you close to being a top 20 let alone top 10 all time great player . Curry has had great success in the nba and in the playoffs for sure he’s a no doubt HOFer just need to pump the breaks with saying he’s unguardable and he’s an all time top 10 player because those are such bogus , biased narratives that completely ignore the nba’s history !"
"&gt;Nets: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmp, and Joel Embiid            Welcome to the 2022 NBA Season!"
"He got DPOY for his impactful help defense. Not his man to man defense. Also, it's Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. KD puts efficient 30 pieces on every past DPOY you can list."
"I wouldn’t say it’s a fair asterisk, but people hate him enough that they’ll probably asterisk it even if he does play just because he has Kyrie Irving and KD alongside him.  I get him not getting as much credit if he doesn’t play, because, for the obvious reason that he didn’t play, but he’s definitely a big reason why the Nets are in the position they’re in right now, both seeding-wise from what he did in the regular season to what he did in the first round of the playoffs."
"Of course I get downvoted for speaking the truth but I forgot anytime you say anything bad about curry all the fan boys cry.   In the 2015 finals   Game 2 when Irving got hurt and was replaced by Matthew Delly  Curry scores 19 points on 21% from the field   Fast forward to the 2016 finals   Curry game 1 was either guarded by Irving or left on an island vs Delly and scored 11 points on 26% from the field while getting out played by Shaun Livingston off the bench who scored 20 when curry wasn’t on the court…  Game 3  19 points 3 assists under 50% again with Kyrie Irving guarding him all game    Game 7 when they need him the most  17 points 2 assists shooting 31%     Curry has his amazing moments but he is absolutely not an unguardable player. He’s been shutdown plenty of times by lesser known defenders in games when his team needs him to score badly he has turned into a ghost .   Lebron gets ripped for his 2010 finals stats but curry gets a pass? I don’t think so , everyone has their flaws and curry at times can’t hit shots and when that happens he can barely score."
"&gt; The ball is spreading everywhere and each player is playing with confidence.  As it was with Harden.  &gt; KD and Irving are in rhythm.  KD is, Kyrie less so.  &gt; Harden is a regular season guy and did his job by buying rest time for Kyrie and KD for these moments imo  Harden is flat out a better playoff player than Kyrie is, what are you talking about?"
Feel like im dreaming. We went from Jordan Farmar and Travis Outlaw to Kyrie Irving an Kevin Durant.
"Curry is guardable idk why you brought him up just because he’s the best shooter of all time doesn’t mean he’s unguardable. just ask Matthew Dellavedova in the nba finals how “unguardable” he is . Curry is arguably easier to guard than Kyrie Irving , when both players are hot Irving just has more to offer offensively but with that being said Kyrie isn’t unguardable either . Put a Kawhi on him and that’ll give any smaller guard problems . Durant on the other hand is in a league of his own"
"Pure point guard just refers to a true playmaker.  Somebody who is looking to get everybody invoked and make plays for others most of the time, but can also get their own shot.  Somebody averaging above 7 assists per game is what I think.  CP3 is a 10 apg type of guy.  A non-traditional PG is Kyrie Irving or Damian Lillard who looks to score first and pass second.  CP3 looks to pass first and then he turns it on to score in crunch time in the 4th.  He’s not the teams main scoring threat all game, that would be Devin Booker."
"&gt;KD never disrespectful of other baller.  When asked to list the top 5 players he's ever played with he picked Serge Ibaka over Russell Westbrook.  Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Serge Ibaka  Serge was on the team when he roasted it with the burner account saying him and Russ were the only good players and ""he couldn't win with those cats.""   KD has absolutely disrespected other ballers."
"Mavs also had Luka and a bunch of scrubs. This team has Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving, plus a James Harden sitting in the sidelines"
"Shaq, Dwyane Wade in 2006 was not a great shooter but he still had to shoot all those free throws and did pretty well lol, and Greek Freak I do believe can lead a team to a championship, however it's like whoever it was on one of these Sports shows said, he is a Shaq who needs a Kobe, if Giannis had a Devin Booker/ Kyrie Irving type as his second option, obviously with a solid team around him that could be a title Contender right there"
"There’s nothing curry can do that Kyrie can’t do....   Kyrie is also faster, quicker than Curry   I’d give Curry the slight edge mainly because he’s selfless and egoless and not much drama/ baggage   But Irving can hang with Curry toe to toe"
"Yeah but imagine being Giannis and being confined to helping off Blake Griffin who is draining threes like it’s 2018.   Imagine being Giannis and having to guard the best offensive player of the century and getting blown by on every move and being just a hair too slow on every contest  Imagine being Giannis and being stuck on Kyrie Irving exclusively because he doesn’t get roasted off ball when switching on screens which would lead to an open 3 for Kyrie or the screener.   No matter how you look at it, Giannis is not an elite defensive asset against the Nets, not with a 5 out offense"
Kyrie Irving is a good person. Always get downvoted when I say that.
Maybe that’s because their best player was Kyrie Irving
Never in my life would I have thought that fans would agree that a team with Kyrie Irving Blake Griffin and Kevin Durant is not considered stacked.
&gt;Put Ricky on the same teams as Kyrie Irving and Ricky would have at least 5 championships. Put Kyrie on timberwolves and they break record for worst team in history.  Uhh what
"I kept trying to tell people fans were just trying to hype themselves up into thinking anyone has a chance against the Nets. People would say ""oh they don't have a rim protector"", MF you really out here thinking you need defense when you have KD, Harden, and Kyrie?   People were really out here convincing themselves Giannis, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday were gonna compete against Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Got me fucked up.  I will say one thing I was wrong about, I said the Bucks have a chance if one of the big 3 gets injured but right now it's looking like that's not even true."
"Kyrie Irving is the #1 most overrated point guard in NBA history because of his fancy dribbling. He never led winning team by himself, only wins when teamed up with MVP players.  Put Ricky on the same teams as Kyrie Irving and Ricky would have at least 5 championships. Put Kyrie on timberwolves and they break record for worst team in history."
"Yeah I guess you have a point actually. 55/40/90 is a lot more exclusive than I would have thought. Literally the only members of that club is Kyrie Irving x1 and Stephen Curry x3.  On the flip side, setting it to just 50/40/90, but instead using 2P%, gives us the following:  Larry Bird x2  Mark Price x2  Reggie Miller x1  Chris Mullin x1  Peja Stojakovic x1  Steve Nash x4  Jose Calderon x1  Ray Allen x1 (I forgot to check minimums before saying he'd get like 4, my bad)  Kevin Durant x1  J.J. Redick x1  Stephen Curry x4  CJ McCollum x1  Kyrie Irving x2  Malcolm Brogdon x1  Khris Middleton x1  In retrospect and after remembering what the minimum makes are, I actually agree with you. I think this list covers it pretty well, with it being largely the same except for a couple newcomers, as well as Steph, Price, and Kyrie getting more of these seasons."
Lol right? “Beyond Kyrie Irving and Kevin Fucking Durant this Nets team isn’t really all that talented”
"They still have Irving, KD, &amp; Blake looks like he was playing opossum in Detroit so they're still loaded, they're very very close to a super team.  Kyrie Irving was right there with Lebron coming back 3-1 going head to head &amp; arguably outplaying Steph Curry."
"Look if Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving beats us by hitting open jumpers all day, I can live with that.  *loses by 40*"
He's guarding Kyrie Irving...
"Bucks deserve some hate but let’s give the Nets SOME credit. Shout out to:  Kyrie Irving for showing everybody that next step he’s taken to a bonafide star.  Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James for being those role players off the bench playing great minutes and filling in on the offense without losing a step.  The bench unit for stomping on the Bucks bench unit in garbage time.  Steve Nash for having these guys all play up to their potentials and play good basketball. And good defense."

"Kyrie Irving has already proven that he can win a championship as the second best player. Full strength Lakers were the only team capable of stopping the Nets pre-Harden. With Harden, that's gg"
see my comment to the other guy--  &gt;switchign every time to shutdown star players is a fuckign pipedream. Kevin and Ky are getting whatever the fuck they want regardless what brook lopez does.  obviously playing drop against shooters is tough but kevin durant and kyrie irving will get their shots either way to a certain extent so its like shrug lets just do what we do?
Imagine thinking LeBron had to carry a trash Cavs team including the super heavy garbage Kyrie Irving 🙄
Kyrie *Uncle Drew Not a bad shot* Irving
"Kyrie ""OT Lilliard"" Irving."
Kyrie Irving! This Nets team is playing beautiful basketball.
Kyrie Irving is a Brooklyn Net.
"For comparison, here's the list of key players who missed  games in the 2015 playoffs due to injury. (I chose this year at random, but it may have been an outlier as well)  *Stars/Borderline Stars*  * John Wall * Pau Gasol * Kevin Love * Kyrie Irving * Rojon Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul * Mike Conley  *Key Role Players:*  * Andrew Bogut * Tony Allen * Kyle Korver * JR Smith"
"“As a bucks fan, you hate to see James Harden injured.”  “As a bucks fan, you hate to see Kyrie Irving injured”  “As a bucks fan, you hate to see Trae Young injured”"
&gt;Step 3. ~~????~~ undercut kyrie irving
"I had never heard of the VORP before, and looking through the all-time rankings is actually super interesting. I didn't realize certain guys were as good as they were (or maybe recency bias is more pronounced). For example:  Detlef Schrempf is rated higher than Blake Griffin and only decimal places behind Kyrie Irving. Ballin'.  Rod Strickland better VORP than a bunch of bigger names (Kyrie Irving, Melo, Paul George). Don't remember him being such a stud.  Lowest-rated Hall of Famer I saw was Sabonis with a VORP of 18.44. He is sandwiched between Dale Davis and Danny Manning, with Jamal Crawford close behind.   Andrei Kirilenko just above Isaiah Thomas (!)"
Kyrie Irving for Dame? Doubt there is any truth to that rumor so Nets would not do it.
"Kyrie is 3rd option. When i think about it its insane, Kyrie is clear 3rd option but still 40/50/90. Harden Durant and Irving is so insanely OP"
Name the last time a team won the Finals without their best player.   The few times even a game or series is so small:  Patrick Ewing and Kyrie Irving might be it. And really that just told us that Tatum was the actual best player.
Why don’t you include Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love though?
"""...Back in 2015, the Warriors were basically billed as a three-time lotto winner -- to the point that plenty of people STILL put somewhat of an asterisk by that title -- because they faced injured opponents along the way. Jrue Holiday missed the first round for New Orleans. Mike Conley missed the second round for Memphis. Most notably, LeBron's Cavaliers were without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving (for all but Game 1) in the Finals. """
Kyrie Irving did this when he was with Celtics. Didn’t travel for playoff games.
"""I see things nobody else can.""  -Boogie 'Kyrie Irving' Cousins"
Steve Nash and Kyrie Irving are the epitome of elbow-in shooters.   It's simply about having your shooting foot in front of your non-shooting foot and your shooting shoulder rotated to point toward the basket (and therefore your elbow as well) to allow for a natural release of the ball.
Kyrie Irving is a Superstar.
"yeah, here it is.   Kyrie Irving, in Free Verse  What does ""government"" mean to you? Is it oppressive, or society's glue? It holds us together, that is true. But I ask you now to take another view:  For you see, science is fake. Heed my call, yall must wake! Every white coat says none but lies. The truth is airplanes can't fly.  Fly? Where? Around the GLOBE? Ignorance is bliss while you interlope. The world is flat, God said it right. Just use your eyes and trust your sight.   The NBA is a weight on my back. Ignore my 150 million dollar contract. Wake up, friends! Don't accept lies! For the revolution will not be televised!  NAMASTE!"
"Melbourne, Australia city with the most number 1 draft picks. Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving and Andrew Bogut"
You see what you want to see. I said I haven't watched. I do have a clip of him purposefully not giving Kyrie Irving a place to land after jumping.
"Alright. Well, i know my sister knows Kyrie Irving and not James Harden, but I'd be awfully hesitant to say Kyrie is bigger star than Harden."
"For starters, I hated the Rockets when Harden was there. We had to play this man in 4 playoff series since 2015, and they always squeezed out at least one game in no doubter series and pushed us to the limit when Nike started showing up on jerseys. When he became a Net, I was questioning how his isolation style was going to transition with another iso man (Irving) and a complete unicorn (Durant). Also, other stars' playstyles were much more interesting. Curry has the accuracy and improvisation, LeBron is a basketball IQ guy, Giannis is the braun of basketball, and etc.  Luka made the cut on the list of players who I found had a more interesting approach to the game than Harden. And he's reinforcing that by carrying a future contender with all he can. Just a little help will get them into the CF. For Harden, the Rockets did all they can to give him help and save for 2018, they were still out of reach. I also find Harden to be a tad bit predictable now. I know he's going to do those moves when he's the lone star on the court or if he's there to take weight off of KD or Kyrie.  I don't know."
"True, people should acknowledge this when the make statements comparing him to the greats as well.  Trae bad game = he’s young, first playoffs etc Trae good game = he’s the most clutch, confident player ever, ICE TRAE, better than Kyrie Irving blah blah blah"
That dog is more durable than Kyrie Irving.
"Kyrie Irving in Game 5 of the 2017 Finals absolutely sold. He probably knew it was his last game there anyway so I'm not sure how hard he was trying, but IIRC, he didn't make a single shot in the 2nd half of that game."
"I’m probably in the minority, but IMO Pippen has a point - neither Kyrie Irving nor Kevin Love were legitimate #2 stars on a championship-caliber team in 2016.  Considering the team around him (and for that matter the fact the Warriors went 73-9), the 2016 NBA Championship is LeBron James’ greatest career achievement."
Chemistry is never an issue for a LeBron team? I think Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love would disagree
"I've always thought that the ""next generation"" stuff or dividing players by generation was dumb.  Durant, Curry, Harden, others were considered the next generation in ~2012-13  AD, Kawhi, Kyrie Irving &amp; several others was considered the next generation in ~2015  Giannis, Jokic, Embiid were considered the next generation after that  And then came Trae Young, Luka, Zion, etc...  It doesn't make sense to split NBA players by generation. The NBA is always gradually changing. There is never a sudden shift from one generation to the next."
Uncle Drew was Kyrie Irving??
so we should start comparing Cade Cunningham to Kyrie Irving?
"Ehh I've met several Koreans abroad who were into the NBA so there's definitely a base there. I met a Korean dude in India who didn't speak much English and we had a really cute conversation where one of us would bring up a player (say Kyrie Irving), the other would go ""Ohhh yeah he's really good. Really good!"" and then we'd repeat with a different player haha."
"Little do you know, the best thing that can happen to Boston fans is Bill Simmons and Jackie Mac no longer discussing us.   Also Kyrie Irving was the main antagonist in that series. We have no qualms with KD."
Below Kyrie?! non-basketball fans have never heard of Kyrie Irving lol
Correction: kyrie irving won a chip without any help
"Look kid, I don’t know how subtle you think you’re being, but it’s pretty clear you’re a die hard Luka fan and I’ve gotten you pretty flustered.   “Bu- but.. L-Luka shot 1% better this y-year”   We are discussing who the better overall shooter was.  Again, if your argument is that Luka shooting *1%* better this year equates to him being a better overall shooter, ill let you be deluded in peace (you are embarrassing yourself lol) there are so many more variables to take into account. Talk about grasping at straws. At first it was the better overall shooter, then you move the goal posts upon getting proved wrong? Laughable. You sir are fanboy with tunnel vision   Zach Lavine shot a higher % overall from 3, AND a higher % from 25+ feet, on MORE volume than Irving, Heild, Harden, Young, Doncic, Bogdanonvic, Tatum, Hardaway. Who in their right mind would say Zach is a better shooter than everyone on that list? Maybe like 3 of them?. This is why you don’t go by a single season. If we went by this season alone, we would have to conclude that CJ and Kyrie are better shooters than Dame.   It’s a little sad that you have to hyper fixate in on a **1%** difference in a single season, because the stats show Trae is the better shooter for his career.  Trae shoots better for his career by almost every metric you can find. Sorry dude, but that’s checkmate."
"Lebron never has any help. He's only played with Kyrie Irving, ADisney, Dwane Wade, Chris Bosh and Kevin Love."
"Honestly if fans overstep their bounds, there’s a part of me that wishes players could set them straight.  Like earlier this playoffs.  Obviously Trae Young and Kyrie Irving are not that guy, but no fan would assault Russell Westbrook if they thought he would be allowed to do something about it."
"JMAC drops some real bombs like ""that Kyrie Irving... he's a real hooper, if he can stay healthy.""  Real fuckin profound commentary there... jfc"

It doesn’t matter how many words you write. Comparing Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish to James Harden and Kyrie Irving is laughable. Take off those homer goggles.
"I really hope he pulls a Kyrie Irving and makes a shitty movie about an old man punking young kids on the courts in the hood.  And call it ""Trae Old""."
Kyrie Irving told a stadium filled with season ticket holders he would re-sign with the Celtics
Kyrie Irving and Paul George have generally not been very consistent in the playoffs. I’d take Trae over them.
"Trae Young is not a better basketball player than Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, and Paul George. All of these guys are more consistent and efficient than Trae Young."

"&gt; But you put KD in Brooklyn, and Kyrie [Irving] gets hurt and James Harden ain’t that guy, now KD not only has to score for them but also make plays for them.  I'm addressing this point that Scottie made, if Harden isn't injured, then he is the one who runs the offense and sets the table for everybody else and allows KD to only focus on getting buckets. That's why their partnership is so lethal, allows KD to focus on what he does best."
"No, and I don't think Scottie is wrong really, he makes some good points, with the exception of the Harden bit, which was dumb.   &gt; It’s not an individual game, you can’t go into basketball and beat nobody with an individual record. And I used this example of what happened to Kevin Durant just the other day: this is the first time we’ve ever really seen Kevin Durant have to be the man and bring the team home. We ain’t never really had to see that because he’s had [Russell] Westbrook, Steph Curry, Klay [Thompson]. He’s been beating people, definitely in Golden State, by committee. With a team. He did that, but that team already knew how to win without KD. But you put KD in Brooklyn, and Kyrie [Irving] gets hurt and James Harden ain’t that guy, now KD not only has to score for them but also make plays for them. And this is no knock to KD, but they asked me, “Has he surpassed LeBron James?” And my answer was: LeBron James knows team basketball better than KD.  Other than his stupid commentary re Harden that ignores that he was injured, the rest of this is pretty fair.   &gt; KD can score better than LeBron, probably always have been able to. But has he surpassed LeBron? Naw. He tried to beat the Milwaukee Bucks instead of utilizing his team. You see what I’m saying? LeBron James would’ve figured out how to beat them and he wouldn’t have been exhausted and he may not have taken the last shot. But LeBron ain’t KD, and KD ain’t LeBron. KD is a shooter, a scorer. But he doesn’t have what LeBron has.  I feel like this is a good summary of the LeBron vs. KD debate and why LeBron is better. KD would win in a game of 1v1 100 times out of 100 vs. LeBron, but that's not what this game is about, it's about who is the best 5v5 team basketball player and LeBron is better at making his teammates better. KD doesn't really do anything to make his teammates better, he's the ultimate individual player."
"Maybe this doesn't meet your arbitrary bar, but Kyrie has absolutely done more than sing a song about unity or some shit: https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/ny-kyrie-irving-absence-20210120-buw6yvgfabgevkb6iov4kglv5e-story.html"
"Ypu dont know himneituer but your rushing to defejd him.  No, I've seen enough. Kyrie irving is an ass. And anyone who disagrees is either a nets homer, or doesn't watch the NBA."
"I’m glad the bucks were able to choose to protest, I’m glad the NBA let them, I’m glad they were able to choose to finish out the bubble. Not every player felt the same way as kyrie Irving so it’s absolutely fucking true. Again you’re trying to take the moral high ground here but I’m all for the player right to choose. I like watching basketball so I’m happy they chose to play."
"Seriously, Kyrie Irving is the greatest player I never get to see play."
"What about Kyrie Irving who just landed on a foot and twisted his ankle? Or Paul George who snapped his leg in two? Or Lebron stepping on Soloman Hill's foot? How is time management supposed to help solve these freak accidents? Injuries are just about luck, all NBA players are receiving top of the line care"
Kyrie Irving on the Clevelans Cavaliers  won a championship as a point guard. He made it to the Conference Finals and then beat the Warriors for a chip. How is Trae Young the first black point guard to win a game in the conference finals?
"Bro your right, his standing reach is 2 inches shorter than Kyrie Irving who is 6'3"" in shoes with a 6'4"" wingspan https://www.nbadraft.net/nba-draft-combine-measurements-2/"
They’re trash. I threw them away after Game 2 against the Nets when Giannis decided to be Kyrie Irving. If they get a new coach they could be bullies.
"Watching these conference finals, the Kyrie Irving trade was actually a good return for the Cavs. Jae Crowder is a championship level role player as seen by him starting in back to back finals on different teams. They got to take a flyer on Isaiah Thomas, but most importantly they got an unprotected pick in the 2018 draft that included Deandre Ayton (1), Luka Doncic (3), and Trae Young (5). This was a brillaint gambit by the Cavs GM, as not only could they get one of these franchise altering players, but it could have also convinced LeBron to stay if they got someone that could lead a team to the finals like Trae Young or Deandre Ayton."
"I think that racism can manifest in many different ways. For example, segregation. If you look at the racial breakdown of neighborhoods, and correlate that to aggregate family wealth, the numbers are staggering. Also, Boston is a very cliquey place. This creates a division of social circles, which exacerbates the issue of segregation, as it goes from where you live to who you associate with. A lot of Boston is made up of moderately wealthy young adults, and the suburbs are a lot of older-thinking townies who are your classic racists: the n word saying people who don’t like interracial relationships. Those people tend to be the ones at games, ergo the behavior exhibited at times (see Marcus Smart). I can bet you a million bucks the lady who called Marcus the n word was a suburban dwelling, moderately wealthy person. The racist behaviors in Boston are so meshed with class/wealth/social status, that the overt nature of racism doesn’t need to be displayed in order for it to have an effect on Bostonians of color.   You’re right: every major city in the US has these same issues. And Boston shouldn’t be held up as the only place who has these issues, but it’s always important to point out. I think Jaylen had the best comments about this when asked after Kyrie’s dig:  https://www.celticsblog.com/2021/5/28/22459234/jaylen-brown-boston-celtics-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-marcus-smart-danny-ainge-racism  A lot of this “Boston is so racist!” Stuff ends up diluting the actual conversation, because it gets into a back and forth about who lives in a more racist place, which is absolutely bizarre."
The best player being hurt wouldn’t affect the outcome lolol.    James harden coming in fat and kyrie Irving / ad being constantly hurt along with kawhi sitting out of he stubs his toe does not take away from the fact playing through injury as a great player affects outcomes lol.
"Went through the 5 stages of grief in that last series:  Denial game 1: ""He's not ***that*** good, he's just ring chasing with Kyrie, we got this...""  Anger game 2: ""I friggin hate KD...""  Bargaining, games 3+4: ""Maybe he will be worse without Irving.""  Sadness, game 5: ""...fuuuuuckkkkkkkk...""  Acceptance, game 6+7: ""KD is an incredible ball player and should be respected."""
"&gt;  Remember as well, the Cavs have sucked since 2018, and they’ve been rewarded for it plenty of times.   False.  They've had zero lottery picks since LeBron left after 2018 until now.  As the Cavs dropped out of the lottery each of the previous three years, they were not ""rewarded"" for sucking.  Since 1986, the Cavs have drafted in the top 3 a total of..... 5 times.  In 35 years, it's been six if you count this pick (the lottery didn't expand to the top four picks until 2019):  1986 - #1 (Brad Daugherty) 2003 - #1 (LeBron James) 2011 - #1 (Kyrie Irving - *courtesy of the LA Clippers*) 2013 - #1 (Anthony Bennett) 2014 - #1 (Andrew Wiggins) 2021 - #3 (TBD)  The 2013 &amp; 2014 draft classes are among two of the worst rated classes in the last 25 years, &amp; Kyrie doesn't even really because it was the pick from the Clippers trade involving the Baron Davis salary dump.  If you consider being given the #1 pick in two of the worst draft classes almost a decade ago being ""rewarded"" I have some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you."
You’d trade Kyrie Irving for Jae Crowder?   That’s the take you have?   Fine let’s break this down:   1. Bucks aren’t trading Jrue they need his defense  2. Suns don’t have the money for a Jae for Kyrie swap   3. Lowry is a FA and a Lowry ST for Kyrie means the raptors are probably giving up assets they wouldn’t do this   4. PG13 isn’t getting traded.
"Name a team that wants Kyrie Irving, can afford him, and has that player."
"Via Nets Wire:  &gt; Sullivan is the author of “Can’t Knock the Hustle: Inside the Season of Protest, Pandemic, and Progress with the Brooklyn Nets’ Superstars of Tomorrow,” which released on Tuesday. In a conversation with our friends from Celtics Wire on their podcast, Celtics Lab, Sullivan said that Nets ownership was unhappy with Irving over his midseason “pause,” and that Irving could be available for the right offer.  &gt; Celtics Lab: “Kyrie Irving has a player option for ’22-’23. Kevin Durant has a player option for ’22-’23, and James Harden has a player option for ’22-’23. Do you think that the Brooklyn Nets win a championship in, let’s say the next five years, and is it with that big three?”  &gt;Matt Sullivan: “Let me give you guys a little news, I’m not sure that’s been out there. I’ve heard that Nets ownership was quite upset with Kyrie’s ‘pause,’ especially that maskless party that turned his psuedo-paternity leave into more like a COVID suspension. And in the last week I’ve heard rumblings – whispers, really, because cracking the Nets is kind of like breaking into the Kremlin, that Brooklyn GM Sean Marks would maybe, possibly, apparently be willing to at least listen to a trade offer for Kyrie this offseason.  &gt;Now, I’m not sure what the market for Kyrie is at this point. It’s not like Ben Simmons giving you the headache on the court. It’s that complex personality that comes from off the court. I think it’s been annoying some people in the franchise. I can’t speak to his teammates, who obviously want to play with one of the world’s best and get him back there.”"
"Ray Allen and Kyrie Irving are probably ours. I never got the deep love, but it was real-- people who love Kyrie really, really love Kyrie."

Kyrie FUCKING Irving
"Out of all the people in the NBA, Kyrie fucking Irving is the last person who's thought process I could explain to you."
Yup the Kyrie Irving pick was the first in my mind. It had a lot of impact on the league
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
"And the Collin Sexton pick essentially led to Kyrie Irving in Boston, *who then signed with the Brooklyn Nets two years later.*  I literally just made that connection in my head."
"Reminds me of a reporter asking Steve Nash if he was going to bring back James Harden in the Bucks series after Kyrie Irving got hurt. Nash scoffed at the question, and then proceeded to do it anyways.  For as much deserved shit reporters get, I kind of feel bad when they get dunked on in press conferences for asking questions that turn out to be exceptionally valid."
"Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Lamar Odom, LeBron James, and    Kyrie Irving are the only players to win an NBA championship and Olympics Gold Medal in the same year.  &amp;#x200B;  Chris Paul will be joining that list this year."
"Harden's rockets were better because of Harden. Giannis has never played against the same competition as Harden. Look at the playoff competition and it paints a clearer picture, Giannis has won 5 playoff series in his career. 1 against the Pistons...., 1 against the Magic.....1 against the Heat, 1 against a dysfunctional Kyrie Irving Celtics and the most recent one against a injury ridden Nets where the Bucks needed the Nets to lose 2 of their top 3 players in order to win (Harden on one leg shouldn't count, if Kyrie didn't get injured...he wouldn't be playing)"
"3 number 1 picks in 4 years when Lebron left and 2 number 4 picks.   Those players were Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters,  Anthony Bennett, Tristan Thompson and Andrew Wiggins (traded for Kevin Love)."
"It’s his brother they’re worried about. Thanasis, who just singled handedly beat Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Steve Nash in a best of seven."
"Only K Love was injured at the start of the 2015 Finals.  Kyrie got injured in game 1 Overtime after Lebron missed the game winner (if he hits that shot, Cavs would be 1-0 with Irving and I think they would had won it.)  With Irving I think CLE beats the Rockets or Grizzlies."
"Who have we fucked up outside of Anthony Bennett?  Austin Carr, Brad Daugherty, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were all the right pick. Wiggins got us Love.  Stop it with this nonsense.  Only recent argument you can have is passing over Shai for Sexton which really isn't that big of a miss. Okoro and Garland are solid picks."
"Hey, this is just pure speculation but do you think a line up of James Harden, Kyrie Irving, KD, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin would work in today’s nba? Offensively they’d be a monster but I feel like opposing teams would constantly score 120+ points on them every game."
All they needed was Kyrie Irving healthy for 1 more game
Kyrie Irving has been injury prone since he was at Duke. He’s never played a full nba season and he missed numerous time in the playoffs with every team he has been on.    This is open shut… oh yeah he got hurt again this post season
Kyrie literally waived his trade kicker to come to Boston you actual imbecile lol.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2728968-kyrie-irving-reportedly-waived-trade-kicker-to-facilitate-celtics-deal.amp.html  Unreal cognitive dissonance good luck not drowning in the bath my man.
"You referred to the teams in the conference finals. The path to the conference finals have undoubtedly been shaped by injuries. You said “You love to see it.”  For instance: Giannis injuring Kyrie Irving, sidelining him for the rest of the series. So, question: as a Bucks fan, did you love to see that?  Kyrie landing on Giannis’ foot, his ankle bending in a 90 degree angle, falling to the floor and grimacing in pain... was that what you were referring to?"
Kyrie Irving is unlikely to play as he doesn’t like basketball.
Kyrie Led League hence the term “Drew League” and Kyrie is known as uncle drew.   It’s a boot camp for NBA players to improve their ball handling coached by Kyrie Irving
"Kyrie (54) played more games than Harden (44) and Durant (35) this season, and the Nets eight-game winning streak came off the heels of the Harden-Irving combo."
It's fair for you to think that because you just saw the stats this series.   Since you are in Basketball Reference go the main page of the Nets and look up two players: it's Kyrie Irving and James Harden. If you their numbers and resume you'll see that's the reason people were talking about a superteam  But it's a nice step that you already were searching about it on BBref.
"no, i’m right.   https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/21/16012292/kyrie-irving-trade-demand-cavaliers-spurs-heat-knicks-timberwolves-lebron-james  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2723780-report-suns-timberwolves-top-kyrie-irving-trade-destinations-heat-a-long-shot.amp.html"
He's got James Harden and Kyrie Irving. Its not like he made a mistake lmao
"Oh come on. GMs definitely put weight into the Doc and Embiid quotes, not because they think it devalues Ben but because they know it’s forcing Phillys hand even more in trade talks so they can give less to get Simmons.  This sub is fucking idiotic sometimes. Isaiah Thomas for Kyrie Irving? Kawhi Leonard for DeRozan? James Harden for 1st round picks? Those all happened because a team had to make a trade and the teams they were trading with knew they could hold out."
Irving shoots you out of the game. He's never scared to shoot. Kyrie is not mentally weak lol.
We're talking about Ben simmons not kyrie irving
"Ooh nice. Now Kyrie Irving and James Harden to Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance, wonder where Lebron would be if you gave them those for a few games even if they didn’t play the entire series"
"Celtics entered a rebuild pretty much at the same time as the process too. Since then:  Made an ECF with a bunch of misfits led by IT.    Used the talent on that team to create an apparent contender built around Kyrie, Hayward, and Horford. That team blew up due to injuries but made an ECF anyways with mostly rookies/2nd year/bench players.   Team blew up even further due to the continued awakening of Kyrie Irving, retooled for the third time around Kemba walker, Tatum, and Brown. Made the ECF.   That team was hard capped by kembas broken knees. Are now retooling yet again for a team with Tatum and brown as the undisputed leaders.   Obviously starting the rebuild with KG, Pierce, and Rondo as tradeable assets made things easier than they were for Philly, but you don’t need to suck for most of a decade to build a good team."
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
Kyrie Irving missing playoffs due to injury is a recurring alert in my calendar
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
"What are you talking about? Pretty much the only negative things Rozier said about coaching/the organization was that they catered to Kyrie and Hayward to some extent at his expense.   For example, he said “Whatever Kyrie wants done, he’s gonna show it. That’s what he wants done. And you have to adjust” while complaining about the organization/coaching staff “treating Gordon and Kyrie — I wouldn't say different than everybody else — but I feel like they just treated them like they was on that level where there were no adjustments that could be made”.   He straight up recognizes that “Coach was in a tough position, one of the toughest positions” and said that his game plans weren’t being followed. He implied it was Kyrie not doing so and ended up outright saying it in a later interview along with the fact that Kyrie seemed to think he was a coach and acted like it.  Quotes should all be in the sources below:  https://sports.yahoo.com/celtics-mess-of-a-season-rooted-in-kyrie-irving-and-the-franchises-obsession-with-the-future-063908327.html  https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/05/14/terry-rozier-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-nba-free-agency/?amp  https://www.audacy.com/weei/blogs/nick-friar/rozier-talks-brad-stevens-and-kyrie-irvings-relationship"
Goddamn Boston fans have a really unhealthy obsession with kyrie Irving lol.
"*”Just underlying racism, and treating people like they're in a human zoo. You know, throwing stuff at people and saying things. There's a certain point where it just gets to be too much.”* Kyrie Irving, May 31, 2021"
"So you think Jokic is an incredible ball handler, akin to Kyrie Irving etc.?  Or Allen Iverson? Like wtf are you talking about"
"Irving wanted to be the man after he left LeBron in Cleveland, then couldn't handle being the main guy in Boston and ends up as arguably the #3 guy in New Jersey. And what does LeBron do without him? Drags a team of scrubs to the Finals in 2018 and wins another ring in 2020. And the other 2 seasons he was actually injured, so fully healthy LeBron is basically 2 Finals appearances and 1 championship post-Kyrie."
Kyrie irving lost his Ironman status the moment he left Cleveland this dude is NEVER available in the playoffs.
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
"You're dumb.  The Celtics replaced a hobbled IT with Kyrie.  That 2018 team was a real contender (sort of, maybe if KD got injured that year instead).  Danny built a great team.  It was just really unlucky that Hayward snapped his ankle and Irving missed the last 2 months.  Still they pushed the Cavs to 7, and Tatum and Brown got some good experience.  Also it was Sexton, not Shai."
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
"Kyrie Irving, mostly off the court  Edit: The catch here is we're trading him for LeBron"
"That's exactly what I'm referring to, people using blanket statements irrespective of that player's role, who their teammates are, what type of system they play in etc. Nobody who watches their games can tell me with a straight face that Kyrie Irving should alter his game and take more threes just because analytics demand it."
"This right here. Kyrie Irving is a great person, there are no “complications” with his character and he gives back to his community more than most millionaires.   Does he have stupid opinions for someone that went to a prestigious private university and constantly flies in airplanes? Yes, but none of that reflects poorly on his character as a human being."
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, so four?"
"Strawman. If you’re raising kids that easily influenced by Kyrie fucking Irving then you’re the problem. Those same kids sit up and play call of duty and games literally centered around murder, why aren’t you as upset about that?"
"If kyrie was just a regular person at most he would be considered eccentric. If he was just Kyrie Irving, CPA he might bounce around to a couple firms but has a good client roster. His two faced stuff would probably work better in corporate world. His conspiracy theories wouldn’t be an issue and probably not leave his 2 bed 2 bath condo in Hoboken.   He’s never been in trouble and seems like an alright dude to teammates. Just that he’s not as good at hiding his weirdness when the lights are bright."
Kyrie Irving has the best offensive arsenal in terms of pure skill in the history of the game.
"LeBron doesn't have the diminutive-size aspect, so maybe Steph Curry instead? However, LeBron also rests a lot in game for defense like Messi does, although this is obviously different in basketball and soccer.  You can also look at things like comparing Messi/Neymar to LeBron/Kyrie Irving."
"C'mon man. You especially should know for every Lebron James and Kyrie Irving you manage to find you'll get just as many Anthony Bennett's and Andrew Wiggins'. No disrespect to Cade because I'm sure he will kill it but SGA is one of the fastest developing players I've seen in years. And I'm sure the Thunder were ""extra careful"" with keeping him on the sideline this year considering how many games they were winning."
Kyrie Irving is a pathological narcissist and needs counselling.
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
The media vs Kyrie Irving is a pretty interesting battle
"You can and definitely should be able to talk about people more holistically. This sub, the internet in its whole tbh, tends to reduce people to fit whatever narrative it wants to push at the time. People are often very complicated and contradictory.   Kyrie is a narcissist who refuses the work and evidence of scientists who put far more work into their fields than he or us ever will. He also demonstrates a wonderful sense of empathy and compassion with charity outreaches like this and this (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/ny-kyrie-irving-absence-20210120-buw6yvgfabgevkb6iov4kglv5e-story.html%3foutputType=amp).   His proliferation of conspiracy theories shouldn't be handwaved away, but neither should his charity.   People are, not shockingly, right about some things and wrong about others."
"Kyrie Irving lives in the reality he wants to live in. That's honestly the best way to put it at this point. Kyrie wants to do humanitarian stuff, he's gonna do it. Kyrie wants to take a week off from the Nets to muse internally about family values and society, Kyries gonna do it.    I don't always agree with his decisions, but I envy his ability to always do what he thinks is the right action, regardless of the input of those watching."
"Part from Kyrie's apology: ""“I do research on both sides,” Irving said at the time. “I’m not against anyone that thinks the Earth is round. I’m not against anyone that think it’s flat. I just love hearing the debate.”  Not exactly an apology, more like he was called out and he had no choice but to address it. Good for him but it's very obvious his stance is still flat earth.   From the same article: Irving said he’s since learned certain thoughts are best kept in “intimate conversations.”   [source](https://www.nba.com/news/kyrie-irving-regrets-flat-earth-comments)"
"&gt;then so is everyone else who works for a living, including Kyrie  How? Everyone else is isn't being paid to push nonsense agendas or make bullshit narratives.   &gt;Media members also happen to be part of the reason that superstars like Kyrie Irving make millions. Their narratives bring in viewers.  No it isn't. Kyrie's skill is the reason he's paid millions. People pay to watch him play basketball."
"It’s their job. It’s what they’re paid to do. If that makes them pawns, then so is everyone else who works for a living, including Kyrie. Media members also happen to be part of the reason that superstars like Kyrie Irving make millions. Their narratives bring in viewers. He should respect where his bread gets buttered.  I should clarify that I don’t think he’s a bad person. He’s a *good* person and a *great* basketball player. He just puts his foot his mouth a lot and it makes it easy to root against him as a fan. I would never wish ill on him in life though."
"Its an interview about his book that details different issues and quirks that the Nets stars present within the franchise and hes specifically asked by begley “do you think there are misconceptions about Kyrie Irving”  He didnt just add it for no reason, theres context within the interview/question that justifies saying it."
"Yeah it adds to the narrative of the Nets as villains. Narratives are a huge part of the game for fans, are you not aware of this?  Plus, some of the dumb shit he says is just flat out really funny.   I could flip this around too. If the fact that I hate on Kyrie Irving bothers you, why not just ignore me?"
"I disagree, dude. And a lot of other people do too. It’s great what he does for the community but his pseudo-intellectual BS really gets on my nerves. There are few things in the world that annoy me more than stupid people who think they’re smart, and Kyrie Irving has shown numerous times that he falls into that category."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/movies/kyrie-irving-nba-celtics-earth.html   &gt;Mr. Irving, a West Orange, N.J., native, is among the most popular basketball players in the world, and he has one of the best-selling basketball jerseys in the N.B.A. With that popularity has come controversy: He has questioned several times whether the Earth is round, and in an interview on Friday with his most in-depth comments to date on the subject, he said that it was still worth debating.  &gt;“Can you openly admit that you know the Earth is constitutionally round?” he said to me. “Like, you know that for sure? Like, I don’t know.”   This is from 2018. I've changed my mind, the guy is just a fucking idiot straight up.   Sweet mother of god:    &gt;Well, I would push back and say that there’s a real picture of the Earth taken by astronauts. Do you not believe that picture is real?  &gt;No, I’m actually — yeah. Like I said, I do research on both sides. I’m not against anyone that thinks the Earth is round. I’m not against anyone that thinks it’s flat. I just love hearing the debate. It’s fun to talk about."
"&gt; You can’t just look at season averages and blindly apply them.  No but you can make reasonable assumptions.  If you think Jae Crowder is going to go 0/8 every night or the Bucks are gonna shoot 45% from 3, you're going to be very disappointed.  &gt; After all it was just a few weeks ago we got obliterated by the Nets to go down 0-2 in that series.  You do understand that you guys probably don't win that series if Kyrie Irving doesn't get hurt right? Unless you plan on injuring some Suns, I wouldn't use the Nets series as a reason to not panic."
"If the discussion is how the suns got to be a finals team and you want to talk about Kyrie Irving and not the actual team that is in the finals, sure I’ll gladly tune that out."
Kyrie Irving
Hey Israel was very for America being over there. You’re playing victim a little hard here. Maybe that’s what happens when your political opinions come from whiny basketball players who are functionally useless human beings such as kyrie Irving or KD.

The IRS would just make them pay the backtaxes plus interest. I highly doubt Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are going to jail for tax fraud.
"He will never top Kyrie Irving, and this is coming from a Celtics fan, we hate Schroeder for how he schooled IT"
"The year prior DeAndre Jordan was a NY Knick and would have given them info on how the org is run.  But KD literally once cited the black jerseys as a reason he joined, so it might not be that complicated.  &gt;New York City was the Mecca of basketball, and KD wanted to live there. But he felt like Brooklyn was his vibe: ""chill, on the low, all-black everything."" He’d been eyeing the Nets for years now, and they him.

"&gt; This will almost certainly result in a league investigation in BKN   ...AND AT NUMBER 11, IN THE POINT GUARD POSITION, KYRIE IRVING  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, GIVE IT UP FOR YOUR SEATTLE NETS"
Is Kyrie Irving adopted and hes real father is Coach Bud?
"I would agree with you on that. The only point i was making is that Kyrie Irving has yet to put a team on his back and carry it to the playoffs, when the comment above implied that he had. Take from that anything you will. Its 100% a flawed metric."
*Kyrie Irving has entered the chat.*
"The Nets came pretty close to beating the Eastern Conference champs with just KD and a peg-leg Harden. As someone who used to make Chris McCullough memes, I have no complaints about a prime Kyrie Irving that just averaged 27PPG on 50/40/90 shooting being on our team."
"Absolutely.  &gt;The veteran Blake Griffin has officially signed for the Brooklyn Nets. This mid-season trade is expected to be the hottest news as of now. However, the team is aggressively pursuing free-agents. DeAndre Jordan has finally reunited with Blake Griffin since Los Angeles Clippers’ days. Veteran Blake Griffin said that it was not DeAndre Jordan who recruited him the most to join Brooklyn Nets rather it was Kevin Durant.   &gt;   &gt;Since the trade a lot of teams including the Philadelphia 76ers have expressed their opinions. This is a clear warning that the team is making a title contending squad. Blake Griffin recently met with head coach Steve Nash. Griffin said that KD was mostly in touch with him. He said, “I talked to KD the most,” he said. “I’ve known James, KD, Kyrie, and DeAndre for a long time, so this is a familiar team for me.”  He's very good friends with Irving too. I'm assuming the Team USA had some factor into that."
Kyrie Irving 100% smokes blunts
"Sometimes teams will take on a contract to get a draft pick. Usually they're not lottery picks.   The pick that became Kyrie Irving was. Cleveland took on Baron Davis's remaining contract dollars in exchange for Mo Williams. The Cavs' extra booty for taking on this extra money was the Clippers' unprotected lottery pick that year. The cavs won the lottery with that pick. It was somewhere between 7 and 9 in the draft order prior to the lottery.   This was the Donald Sterling Clippers. They were not smart.   As stated many times on the thread, there's a limit to how much teams can send out and take in per year. The rule came into effect after Portland bought a lot in the mid 2000s and Minnesota sold a lot. The rule used to be capped at 3m per transaction. Now it's adjusted to 3% more per year, or something close to that. Currently, ~$5.6."
OP is Kyrie Irving
Fuck are you Stephen Jackson or Kyrie Irving?
"“That’s just boring ass way to talk about the game”... but previously proceeded to bring out fractions. Exciting. When compared to Kyrie Irving for example, sure they’re not as skilled with both hands. These players go with their strength and they don’t prioritize showing you that they can drop 20 with their off hand. If they’ll force a shot attempt with their off hand, logic dictates might as well pass to a teammate that is in a better position to score. No one at the NBA level looks at the ball when they dribble and all are capable of finishing with the off hand because these are basic. It’s more about consistently attempting and making those like Kyrie or Kobe. They have the green light to force those type of shots but I would say majority if not all are capable at the NBA level."
Get out! Kyrie Irving acting entitled and flagrantly disregarding rules while constantly trying to play the victim? I’m shocked.
Kyrie Irving was that dude in high school where you’d say “good morning” and he’d respond with some obscure quote from The Art of War or some shit. But he also had like a C- average because he never paid attention and never actually read any of the books he quoted
"Oh really? A team featuring Kyrie ""what I say is not what I mean, and what I mean is not what I say"" Irving and Kevin ""my social media burner accounts are a modern day memory hole"" Durant? Nah... nothing Kremlin-esque about them."
"&gt; Boston Celtics star Kyrie Irving says he has been reaching out to ""a few people"" this season, trying to figure out how to be a better leader.  &gt; Just don't ask him who those people are.  &gt; ""I will never tell you guys,"" Irving said with a smile at shootaround on Wednesday. ""Never tell you guys. I like having a **mystical wisdom**, like, older board of people I like to go to."""
"Classic case of mistaken identity—it was Ky Birving, not Kyrie Irving."
&gt; I think we win 3 rings if KD doesn’t go to GSW  really unfortunate that the superteam LeBron tried to build in Cleveland with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love got defeated by an even better one
"Kyrie Irving being flat earth really easily sums up every issue I have with him.   The total lack of self awareness, humility, and critical thinking to believe everyone else is wrong and YOU are right about something as easily provable as the shape of the earth…  What a jackass. Lol."
"Here’s what Kyrie’s said on KD’s podcast about the  situation (copied/pasted from https://netswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/01/kyrie-irving-kenny-atkinson-was-great-for-the-group-that-he-served/)  “I want to give a shout out to Kenny Atkinson because some people came out and was like, ‘Yo, Ky and KD got Kenny fired.’ And look, that was completely false. Listen, Kenny was great for the group that he served, and I was very appreciative of what he was giving us throughout the season when we were playing. We always heard how great Nash was or saw how great Nash was as a player, but also when you get to know him as a person, you understand why he can co-exist with us because we don’t need somebody to come in and put their coaching philosophy on everything that we’re doing and change up the wheel and, ‘Yo, you guys need to start doing this,’ and we start running on the first day of practice, and it’s just like, ‘No.’”  I want somebody, I need somebody that’s going to understand that I am a human being first. I serve my community and where I come from first, and then basketball is something I come and do every single day because I love [it], and also I have the right ingredients and people around me to come in and do my job at a high level, and I know that they will hold me accountable to that level. It’s no disrespect to Kenny or any other coaches I played with, it’s just Steve coming in at this moment and then following up with putting together a great coaching core was going to make us more successful.”"

Kyrie Irving is an anti semite so Kyrie Irving can go fuck himself.
"They're injured currently, Middleton is the go-to guy, it is what it is. If Kyrie Irving was there for Nets, Nets would win imo, but it's only ifs and what could haves."
"&gt; Go look at the rosters of the teams LeBron beat to come out of the East.  Which ones are you referring to?   LeBron's 1st Cavs run roster is underrated, particularly 2009 and 2010 roster when they shot 40+% from 3 excluding LeBron from the percentages. It was an elite shooting team backed by the best driver in the game. There's a reason why they won 60+ games those two seasons while the other seasons they were only around 50. The competition in the 2nd Cavs run was just straight up embarrassing and overrates LeBron's accomplishments. I mean the biggest threats were literally Paul George, Oladipo Pacers, Isaiah Thomas, Rookie Tatum, lmao. Literally Kyrie Irving was way better than all those guys, let alone the role players + Love."
"Almost every star this playoff got injured though, especially on the teams they faced.  You saying almost every team built a team of injury prone players?  Anthony Davis,  Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Jaylen Brown  I mean even Chris Paul got hurt, and Booker broke his nose.  Those are just the guys who would be considered stars."
"""It's Kyrie Irving on the drive....and scores!""  -Marv"
"That was a Kyrie Irving level finish in traffic, damm"
"There are 2 videos in particular - one about Setting the record straight about All The Smoke podcast, and then there's one where he's talking about Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving being targeted by the media - which you should definitely watch."
The Clippers traded an old Baron Davis and a 1st to the Cavs for Mo Williams so they could save money. The 1st was Kyrie Irving
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn’t move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn’t move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That’s a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn’t work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
"Yes, who could have predicted the likes of Anthony Day-to-Davis, Kawhi “degenerative knee condition” Leonard and Kyrie “skips the playoffs literally every other year” Irving missing time.  Shit happens, that’s not their problem."
"Yeah that was definitely an omission on my end although one can quibble about how much of that is solely due to LeBron being born in Ohio.  One could have easily imagined the mid 2010 Cavs hitting the salary cap to keep their ‘talented young roster’ of Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins together."
"I put empty stats in quotations for a reason. They’re not empty, but inflated due to the role they get to play. And Kyrie, Mitchell, and Beal are more complete offensive players. They’re better passers (assist count doesn’t always correlate to better passing) and as you mentioned, better offensively anyways. Beal, Mitchell, and Irving are top 25 guys while Lavine and Fox are closer to top 50 despite their stats portraying them as all nba guys."
"His injury history is pretty wildly exaggerated at this point, he plays way more than Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving did over the last five season and you never see these kinds of comments about them."
Best hairline n the game: Kyrie Irving. Paul George second.
"No whats important is common sense. But yeah ur right, I guess kyrie Irving and James harden being injured was irrelevant, u sound like a smart guy"
Kyrie Irving and Lebron is not a super team
https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/washington-wizards/kyrie-irving-reveals-he-believes-earth-flat-believes-other-conspiracy-theories
It’s pretty much only Kyrie Irving. He avoids contact in general.
"People keep saying ""there's no way Milwaukee gets back here again"" as if Kyrie Irving isn't injury prone, James Harden isn't fat and out of shape and in his 30s which led to his injury, and Durant doesn't have an Achilles injury in his history. That team is not guaranteed to do anything."
"DeAndre Hunter is our most versatile defender and having him at the 4 full time takes him away from how we’ve used him defensively. He’s always the primary defender on whoever the opponent’s best perimeter scorer, even if it’s someone smaller like Kyrie Irving.  Also collins’s defense this playoffs has been good. He gets exposed going against Portis and Lopez because he’s not capable of guarding bigger centers full time and that was a great adjustment by Bud to limit how effective Capela is by stretching the floor at all positions and forcing Collins out of his weak side shot blocking role on defense."
Kyrie Irving went vegan in 2017: https://www.foxsports.com/nba/kyrie-irving-player-injuries
"4 years ago after LeBron's 8th Finals appearance, Kyrie Irving would comment: ""Never seen so many guys happy after a trade."" Kevin Love would reply with: ""You can't trade me."" Now they're headed to the NBA offseason."
"Hmm, maybe Kyrie Irving, Wade, or Anthony Davis?"
"Player A: 27/5/3 on 48/40/85 shooting  Player B: 16/6/5 on 39/32/75 shooting   Player A is Kyrie Irving in the 2016 finals, player B is Pippen in 1998. I also didn't cherry pick Pippen's one bad year or anything. He was never a prolific scorer at any point in his career."
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
You summed it up pretty well. 60 years ago Bob Cousy would go behind the back and the defender had no idea what to do. They’d probably accuse Kyrie Irving of witchcraft if he played in the 60’s
LeParentalRole.  Cause of that press conference from a couple years ago with Kyrie Irving where the reporter asked him “what kind of parental role has LeBron had” and Irving said something like “I only have one dad.”  Lol.
"Ah yes, Cause relying on Kyrie Irving to be healthy has been such a reliable bet lets see!  2015: Got hurt and missed 2 games in the Atlanta series and then hurt in the finals  2016: Healthy  2017: Healthy  2018: Ruled out for playoffs before regular season ended  2019: Healthy but we all know how he played  2020: Ruled out for playoffs before regular season ended  2021: Sprained ankle against Bucks"
PATRICK “Kyrie Irving “ BEVERLEY
Why is kyrie irving playing for the clippers?
"Kyrie Irving was worse as a number one scoring option than every single one of those guys has already been in their young careers.   I genuinely don’t see how kyrie is better than trae. Trae is a drastically better playmaker, comparable scorer, and already proven better leader than kyrie. Add in that trae is generally a healthier player than kyrie and I’m not buying that kyrie is above him for any other reason than he’s been in the league longer.   No one would take kyrie over Luka and I think trae is closer to Luka than kyrie is to trae."
Even as a Boston fan I’m a little surprised how many people put 23 yo Tatum over prime kyrie Irving lol
"Kyrie, Tatum, Trae, Booker, Mitchell.  The best Kyrie Irving I’ve ever seen is without a doubt better than all these guys."
"Kyrie Irving being called ""**THE OLD BRIEFCASE**""  (for his nasty handle)"

"I’m not sure I should respond but firstly the heat were down like 15 in g1 when healthy. Secondly, if you watched the actual basketball, Kelly olynk was actually huge for the heat that series, him being a stretch 5 actually worked out very well for Miami.

"One bad first round game when they were already up 2-0... Plus all of this are way way blown out of the proportion, thanks to lunatic lebron fans.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19220425/tyronn-lue-cleveland-cavaliers-upset-media-portrayal-kyrie-irving-kevin-love-benching  Kyrie dropped 37 the game before and 30 the game after yet no one talks about that."
"Give he a career with Scottie Pippen any day. Are people here forgetting just how good he was? Comparing him to Kyrie Irving, the disrespect."
"Just a bunch of salty Celtic fans looking through the hindsight bias glass XD  Kyrie use to be famous for his wild drives where he's running downhill at fullspeed and throws up a one handed shot that looks inefficient. Except, it's Kyrie Irving. He made that shot look efficient.  In that series, Buck's lengthy defenders actually exposed that shot for what it is. An inefficient shot.    You can tell Kyrie learned/reflected a lot from that series. Because he cutdown on those drives this season. And replaced them with postups/fadeaways."
Paul George and Leonard comnined are going to miss the same amount of games as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving combined.  Charlotte gets their first ring somehow. Let's say a fourth previously unknown Ball brother carries them to a 65 win season
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden."
From the U.K. as well. I’ve been drawn to miami even tho I’ve never watched their games. The kit is saucy. Most games I’ve watched are nets ones cause kyrie Irving is a wizard. He’s like prime ozil but for basketball
Let's also not forget about the Kyrie Irving Defense Force.

"&gt; Kyrie  Lol Kyrie Irving has a ""wholesome or kind"" public perception???"
"max player doesn't mean superstar.  &amp;#x200B;  Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are not on the same level as Giannis, Harden, KD, and Kyrie Irving. They're great players, to be sure, with their own strengths that Harden and Kyrie may not have, and you'd rather have them in some situations (defensively), but they aren't superstars.  &amp;#x200B;  The league has a salary cap. If the NBA had a free market Kyrie and Harden would be making a lot more money than Middleton and Jrue."
I’d think more along the lines of kyrie irving. Actually surprised he didn’t see him at that nutjob convention.
"Four most fun players I've ever watched: Vince Carter, Jason Kidd, Kyrie Irving, Steph Curry"
You have a harder time than AI himself then [AI on Kyrie and Steph](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2465203-allen-iverson-says-stephen-curry-and-kyrie-irving-have-better-handles-than-him).
I did it with current players    Russ 6’3  Kyrie Irving 6’2  Anthony Edwards 6’4  Harden 6’5  Draymond 6’6   Not the best but probably fun to watch

"Kawhi will definitely make it.   Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Derrick Rose, and Klay Thompason might show up on the list as some 2010s players that aren't on there, but they will be more fringe cases. I'd put the order in terms of likelihood as being Kyrie, Klay, Butler, George, then Rose.   Rodman, Vince, Grant Hill, Carmelo, and Ben Wallace would be the guys most vulnerable to being replaced."
"&gt;Regardless he's a good player if you don't look at him from the worst possible perspective.  Yeah that's exactly what I would say, at least aside from the injury. He was the first option on an average team. The Nets had to play most of the season with him and not Kyrie Irving doing that, and they didn't look worse at all from it. Am I the one missing something? He was good."
Anthony Bennett led to kyrie Irving being drafted so not all bad
Kyrie Irving was also an elite isolation scorer while being efficient
kyrie irving was a ball stopper in cleveland
I'd say he's more like Michael Jordan and LeBron mixed with some Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
Karma gave him a little taste . Guy hurt my boy kyrie Irving .
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love aren't Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The public perception was that the Cavaliers weren't the superteam that the HEatles or the KD Warriors were.
"I can make a list of point guards better than him and then add on other guys as well from other positions and he's clearly in the 30 to 40 range as a player.  Off the top of my head.  CP3 Steph Dame Trae Young Jrue Holiday Ja Morant Kyrie Irving are all point guards better than Russ.  You can argue Ben Simmons (I won't) but that's the range where Russ is.  And then we have players who are better like Beal, Bam, Butler, PG 13, Middleton, Booker, Tatum, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Gobert, KAT.  And then you add Harden Lebron Jokic AD Giannis Luka Kawhi Donovan Mitchell so yeah he's in the thirties clearly."
His stats look worse in the years he's actually not the number option because he's just been declining offensively but that's neither here nor there.  He's not better than Kyrie Irving. That's my point.
Is it better than Landry Shamet?  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * Ben Simmons * Joel Embiid * Kevin Durant * Kyrie Irving * James Harden * Devin Booker * Deandre Ayton * Most likely CP3
"&gt; His impact in his role is too small, even if he’s real efficient at it.  25ppg scorer and elite POA defender.  He'd be one of the highest-scoring #2s in NBA history.  &gt;He could keep getting even better, but it’s unlikely he’ll get to that point. The #2 on the top tier contenders are the likes of AD, Harden.   Lol.  Here are some other #2s over the past decade:  * Kris Middleton * Pascal Siakam * Kyrie Irving * Klay Thompson * Tony Parker * Jason Terry"
"I know the Kings can't draft for shit, but the team that acquires that pick is gonna be laughing if its unprotected  You're in the West so that pick is a lot more valuable than you think it is, imagine if the lottery gods suddenly decide its shooting up and becomes #1 lmao (just ask the Clippers, they dumped Baron Davis with an unprotected pick, that pick became Kyrie Irving)"
"Did you not even read what I wrote? Lebron has never had a ""stacked"" team. He joined a literal lottery team in Miami with an aging Wade and Bosh. Because he was tired of dragging Cleveland to the finals every year single handedly surrounded by literal garbage.   He joins a rookie Kyrie Irving and a past his prime Kevin Love in Cleveland with literally no supporting cast. And he won his championship with Kevin Love out.   He goes to LA on a lottery team playing with rookies and sells the farm for AD surrounded by a b cast of veterans.   Lebron has never had a stacked team."
Oladipo off course was the guy Cavs should have picked but they had Kyrie Irving and Dion Waiters.
"So did LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, and Isaac Okoro"
Best active basketball players alive  1.) lebron James  2.) stephen curry  3.) kawhi Leonard  4.) Kyrie Irving  5.) giannis anteteonlydunkstho    Best player to deceive community with burner accounts  1.) Kevin Durant

"We're in a dimension where Westbrook, LeBron and Anthony Davis will play Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden for an NBA Championship   If you told 2010 Thunder fan me that this would be the situation, I would shit my pants in indecisiveness on who I want to win."

"Shamet has played for four different teams in his first four years.  He has played with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Devin Booker, and possibly Chris Paul."
"The majority of star athletes don’t do as much as kyrie for the world lmao. I don’t think any player does as much as Kyrie does, he literally puts charity work first and basketball second. Nobody puts time and effort like Irving into this kinda shit other than probably Hakeem. When you try to equate little trivial shit he does that doesn’t have any bearing on his character and ignore the insane amount of good work he has done… you just sound like an ignorant hater."
"Next the Sixers are going to ask for Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nic Claxton, #27 and 4 unprotected future first-rounders for Ben Simmons and a cherry Jolly Rancher"
"Kyrie is just another nba star dude, nothing special. Can’t do shit as a first option. Your comparing him to a fucking billionaire superstar rapper, producer, recently engineer, fashion designer, artist and everything   you can think of. Guy was married to the most famous woman in the world and has literally helped break in artists like Big Sean, Cudi and other top acts. I work in the entertainment industry, no one gives two fucks about Kyrie Irving dude, he’s just a regular nba all star. Your comparing him to a top 2 generational rapper( him and Wayne). His music is bang average now but he made insane music for like the first 15 years of his career by way of producing and rapping. How is Kyrie genius level at his craft? One time ring winner and that was with arguably the greatest player of all time on his team. Plays no defense, injury prone, and never has amazing stats. What’s next, Tatum is as good as drake? 😭😭"
"Kyrie Irving: Guy who sells crystals that ""cure"" everything from a kiosk at the mall"
The life of a taller Kyrie Irving with no jumpshot?
"By the end of his career shai will be better than ky. He’s bigger, a more efficient scorer than Irving was at this point in his career, and a much better defender (he’s not good rn but has the tools to be great).  He’s significantly better than fultz Bennett wiggins Ayton antman. He’s better by a decent chunk than kyrie and wall. You can debate KAT.  Zion and AD are the only better ones"
Kyrie Irving inevitably finds irreconcilable differences in all of his relationships.
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."

Compared to kyrie? At least they had a lot of support while getting criticism. Who was supporting Irving?
You also make your own luck. 28 other teams could have traded for the pick that became Kyrie Irving but the Cavs made it happen
Cries in Kyrie Irving :(

Kyrie Irving
Watch as this sub interprets that to mean you can’t criticize Kyrie Irving because someone’s character is simply a bar that moves up and down depending on ones latest actions
Yea it's hard for me to believe that at no point did Nike contact Kyrie Irving about his Kyrie Irving brand shoe. I'm sure if Kyrie wanted a say he could have had one.
"May Kyrie be rewarded, and may God keep him healthy and happy. Pakistan has a looming water crisis and Sindh is atrociously underdeveloped so any help like this is greatly appreciated. LeBron has a well somewhere in Sindh as well I think. Most of the local people who depend on these wells probably don’t even know who LeBron or Kyrie are but I am sure they will be very grateful. Thank you Kyrie Irving for caring for my beloved motherland."

"Man, there's some players I'd rather see in 3v3.  &amp;#x200B;  Kyrie Irving would be amazing here."
You really think Nike wants to be punitive with Kyrie Irving over a trash looking sneaker? The PR hit would go way beyond whatever they could recoup from whatever you imagine they could even do to him.
Who said they didn't try lol? Can you imagine a business discussion with Kyrie Irving?
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook

"“The earth is flat, my own shoes are whack” -Kyrie Irving 2021"
Kyrie did.  Durant's incentives were not classified as 'unlikely'.  [Link](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/07/10/here-are-incentives-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irving-must-hit-to-get-max-salaries/)
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
US sport media is total BS. Why would he care that he’s playing with people who beat him in the finals? MJ ans Scottie were on the 91 team and they beat almost all of them. What the hell are these forced stories? Man Kyrie Irving had it right.
"That's true. Curry, DeRozan, Lillard will probably get there. Anthony Davis is ahead of Andrew by a decent amount, as is Kyrie Irving. Giannis is well on his way as well. Booker and Towns may pass Wiggins as he's climbing."
"After watching him the last two seasons, SGA is a ceiling top 10 guy most likely top 15 type of player IMO. Kyrie Irving level is where I see him. History tells us that you need at least one top 5 player on your team to win a championship. I thought that was going to change this season with the Suns. Alas, the power of Giannis overcame them. With that in mind we won’t be able to make a championship run with him as our best player."
"Kevin Love was not getting more attention than Kyrie Irving in a playoff series, watch more basketball"
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
"&gt;What if that trade happens and Cade ends up a Durant level player? He's regarded very highly relative to other number 1 picks.  He is regarded at the same level as Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving, not Zion, AD, or even Wiggins. Sure he might end up like Durant, but it's more likely he doesn't. There's a good chance he doesn't even end up as good as SGA is right now."
"Its probably the Kings  However the Kings weren't bailed out by 1st picks in very obvious drafts (Lebron James, Kyrie Irving) so Cavs get a congratulations for taking Lebron over Darko award"
Usually a 5 star hotel near the stadium. We used to get a lot of baseball teams staying at the hotel I worked at in downtown Seattle. Kyrie Irving was a regular guest as well.
https://nothinbutnets.com/2021/06/14/kyrie-irving-injury-history-updates/
"From 1990-2019 * Shaq * Chris Webber * AI * Tim Duncan * LeBron * Dwight Howard * Derrick Rose * Blake Griffin * Kyrie Irving * AD * 2 of KAT, Simmons, Edwards, Zion will get there  So about 12/30 = 40% chance. If you want to be more conservative and count out Kyrie and say only 1 of Zion, KAT, Simmons, Edwards will get there still 33%. Thing is though Cade is much more hyped than your average 1st overall pick. The only players that I think match the hype in the last 10 or so years are Zion, Simmons, and AD. I’d give him a 2/3 shot of being top 10 at some point in his career."
Damian Lillard is traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown
"Nooo, My Kyrie Irving-Blake Griffin Duo~  David Stern"
I’ll never forget when Reddit said the Cavs fleeced the Celtics when they traded Kyrie Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas.
"&gt; Might or might not be the D’antoni effect but I’d say he is essentially a slightly juiced up Irving.  I don't think juiced up Irving gives him enough credit.  Kyrie has nowhere near the court vision and passing skills that Harden has.  I think the only rational choice for putting someone over Harden at PG would be Steph, and I think it's fairly close.  They both do different things at an elite level.  I think Harden is clearly the superior on-ball player whereas Steph is clearly better off-ball."
"Could be a Kyrie Irving-esque situation. Misses half of the season due to injury, misses out on all star and all nba due to lsck of games played, then turns it up in the playoffs."

"Khris Middleton is a better #1 option than Kyrie Irving, and is comfortably a top 15 player in the league."
Kyrie Irving
"I always will recommend a few teams   Pistons: got the newest #1 draft pick and you get to watch a team go from being ass to getting somewhere good in time. Basically see a bad team go to being good  Lakers: arguably the greatest NBA franchise. It’s got the current face of the league in Bron there along with multiple superstar/all star players in Anthony Davis and former MVP and current triple double all time leader in Russell Westbrook   Nets: has the walking bucket in Kevin Durant, the guy with arguably the best handles in history in Kyrie Irving, and the guy who can do it all offensively in James Harden  Warriors: Steph Curry is just one of the most fun players to watch and the way they play offense is fun.  Portland trailblazers or Dallas Mavericks: you can watch Dame or Luka on their respective teams do a carry job as they drag their teammates to potential playoff births and defeat.  Feel like each of these teams offer variety and you can tell where they’re each at currently in their timelines. Lakers and Nets are in win now, pistons are looking to become good, Warriors are looking to return to form then Nlazers and Mavs are fun to watch but still a ways away since the teams management need to get their shit together."
"AD, Kyrie Irving, Zion, Wall, KAT, Ben Simmons, Ayton, Edwards, Wiggins, Fultz, Benett  Maybe I'm ranking Wall a bit too high but before his career changing injury, he was so entertaining to watch. I was hoping he could age gracefully but alas.   The back court of Beal and Wall was fun"
Kyrie “oh we on some bullshit today” Irving.  Lmao that face was everything
"Imagine thinking Durant has a ""sharper BBIQ"" than Lebron James and Curry. He's the worst playmaker of the 3, reacts the slowest on defense (obviously more effective than Curry nonetheless due to his length), and the worst at off-ball movement.   He's still ridiculously good because he's effectively a 6'11 Kyrie Irving with worse handles and a crazy wingspan but none of his strengths are what we conventionally associate with ""BBIQ""."
"“Kyrie Irving shouldn’t be All-NBA.”  This, despite him leading a top 4 team, and #2 seed in the East, in scoring (and playing the most games, by far, of the Nets Big 3). And despite him also joining the very elite 50-40-90 Club with 25+ points per game (along with Bird, KD, and Steph).  Fun fact: The All-NBA voters tried their best to agree."

"1: Paul George (turned up when Kawhi was injured. Has also led a team in Pacers and was an MVP candidate at OKC)  2: Devin Booker (made the finals with a 40 piece twice. Arguably best player on that team. No major injury issues. Has potential to be the main player on a championship team).  3: Kyrie Irving (won a chip with Bron with one of the clutchest shots of all time. However has shown poor leadership, very injury prone and locker room CANCER)  4: Trae young (showed up in the playoffs this year. One of the best scorers and playmakers, has made the playoffs, arguably can be placed over Kyrie).  5: KAT (great player who puts up good stats. Never made the playoffs though and hasn't shown the ability to elevate his team like the others on this list)."
Kyrie Irving ranked 20 after a 27-6-5 season on 51/40/92 efficiency? The mental gymnastics to diminish this dude are strong.

"Celtics 2018 was ridiculously talented. Probably most talented team in the league besides GSW. Bill Simmons was right to get all giddy preseason and make his ""lots of smiling and high fiving take"". They just couldn't figure out how to play together at all. But they were stacked and honestly had dynasty potential. Probably should have beat the Bucks but Kyrie and Tatum played god awful.    Irving, Tatum, Brown, Hayward, Horford, Morris, Rozier.     Crazy how they went from all that to a .500 team last year"
"The Hardest Road - Kevin Durant ft. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson,  Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving and James Harden"
"Kyrie Irving is extremely overrated. Dude has made 2 playoffs without LeBron. 1 in Boston (the first one he did not play at all so I don't count it, same with first with Nets) and 1 with the super stacked Nets. For someone who has only made 2 playoffs in his entire career, I hate how people say he's a top 5 PG all time. Stop it."
While this makes sense basketball wise but would never happen because of friendships and the volatility. What about Simmons for Kyrie Irving. 76ers get better offense and Nets get better defense. Probably won’t happen though since Kyrie probably retires right away after that trade
"My unpopular opinion is that Kyrie Irving is much more popular with other NBA players and the Nets organization than Reddit wants to admit. We often only see glimpses into that world, but the reality is that these franchises are all high-quality organizations that know more than most, if not all, of us about matching on-court and off-court talent for maximum effect, which could be focused on revenue rather than championships."
"Daryl Morey is trading himself and Ben Simmons for James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Steve Nash"
\- Klay Thompson is better than Kyrie Irving as a 3rd star of a superteam  \-Zach Lavine is the best dunker in NBA history  \- Chris Bosh was a superstar before joining the Big 3. He is a better fit than Melo ever would have been for the Big 3.  \- Prime Kawhi (16-17) is better than any Durant season
"Omg, for a second I thought it was Kyrie Irving joining Steve Nash's coaching staff! Kyle Korver will be an amazing developmental coach, would love him on the Raptors one day!"
"If you define elite player as someone who can win a chamoionship as the number 1 guy.  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  Paul George  Are not and never will never be elite players. The love this sub has for Kyrie is asinine in my opinion. He's flashy. He doesn't know how to win. His winning percentage in games where he doesn't have another all star is under .500 I believe. That's awful, especially considering he's played his entire career in the East.  He actually has a 48% career winning percentage without LeBron and a 72% with LeBron. And that 48% includes all the games he's played with KD and Harden. LOLOL if you remove those games he is likely pretty close to 44%, and that includes his time with a really deep and talented Celtics team that had a better winning percentage when he was injured."
"- Kyrie Irving without LeBron is nobody.  - Popovich gotta seriously retire.  - Mike D’Antoni is a terrible head coach.  - As a Warriors fan I hated seeing KD in our jersey because everyone discredits our rings during his tenure.  - The Sacramento Kings shouldn’t even exist and I was mad af when the NBA halted their relocation to Seattle.  - We all talk about D-Rose, Brandon Roy, etc. but imho one of the greatest “what if’s” in NBA recent history is Jabari Parker. The hype around him was huge back in the day.  - The “Big 3+1” Boston Celtics were a “superteam” but everyone kinda avoids this conversation.  - The Hall of Fame has become a f*ckin joke.  - The Nuggets are the most overrated team right now."
"1. Kyrie Irving is the most offensively talented player in league history. His offense is so good people sleep on his defense. He is actually a great defender. 2. James Harden is supremely overrated his jumper is inconsistent af but i think he plays way better defense than he gets credit for 3. Draymond has been the best overall defender in the league for years but has regressed so much on offense he may as well be matisse thybulle  4. The Lakers roster is awesome i loved every move...shame they couldn't get Rudy gay tho 5. The bucks don't get passed the second round next year and the sun's getting bounced in the first 6. The Cavs are going to compete for a play in spot next year 7. Bol bol is being under used and under developed under Mike malone 8. Phil jackson is the most overrated coach of all time in any sport 9.  Hakeem is the ""best"" center of all time regardless of rings 10. Larry bird would be joe ingles in today's game"
Who do you think is better: Kyrie Irving or Luka Doncic?
"&gt; How the fuck do you know if a championship was ""stolen"" from you guys  I'm not a Pacers fan, just FYI. I just think it sucks that the NBA totally destroyed one of, if not *the* top contender for the title that year. I'd hate it just as much if the NBA suspended Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving for much or all of this year. I want to feel like the competitive balance is left to the teams and players to decide. I think it's always a bad thing when you're left feeling like the league itself is tipping the scales.   As a Laker fan I hate that people feel like the league has tipped the scales in my team's favor in the past (specifically how everyone still talks about the 2002 WCF), and I hated it when the league vetoed the Chris Paul trade. As an NBA fan, more than anything I want to feel like the league stays out of shit like that that can unbalance everything. It really seemed like in 2004 David Stern effectively said ""because of what happened in Detroit we don't think the Pacers should be able to compete for a championship this year"" and that is just gross to me. Some suspensions or fines would have been fine, but he basically just ended their season in November."
"Kyrie Irving outburst aside is one of the most overrated point guards , ever.  He did nothing ever without lebron, did nothing after he got himself away from bron, and then formed another super team, (as of now) still did nothing. He’s like a flashier jamaal crawford who demands the ball way more."
Kyrie Irving should’ve won the 2016 finals MVP. He was the spark plug that got Lebron and the team going when things weren’t going their way.
Kyrie Irving is not worth the max extension.
Kyrie Irving is the best pg of all time with a terrible attitude and poor focus
Agree with all but number 1. Tobias Harris’ contract is absolutely ridiculous.   I think Kyrie Irving is more overrated than Sabonis as well. He’s a scoring machine but he’s not even close to the level of superstar status he seems to have. He’s not physically big enough to make many plays on his own and will always need a guy like KD with him to make it to the Finals.
Healthy John Wall &gt; Kyrie Irving
"something ironic about that personally for me, is that i was also in rome during the time of the trade and my parents were freaking out at me for still being awake but i was like ""dad were about to get kyrie irving"""
"&gt;Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  Oh wow this is an extremely hot take. 2022-23 I can somewhat see due to MPJs limitless potential but right now he's not at that level yet.  I can agree he's better in the regular season but Murray's offensive IQ, shotmaking, chemistry with Jokic means he's much better in the playoffs. And I'm not just talking about the bubble, talking about 18/19 as well   Edit - my unpopular opinion is that Kyrie Irving will NEVER be a first option on a successful playoff team due to mediocre passing and non-existent defence plus polarising personality"
"Your logic falls on “Ben Simmons isn’t a franchise player, I’d much rather bet against Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden to suck enough for us to get a good draft spot to hopefully hit on a draft pick” also how is that a better bet than betting on Embiids health and for good Sixer picks? Make it make sense."
"I highly doubt kyrie Irving signs an extension this off season and I also doubt he leaves the nets. I think kyrie wants to attention and by him not signing his contract extension he gets that.  Everyone will be talking about how they need to resign him, and then he gets to be "" The man"" in free agency.  Kyrie fancies himself on the same level as KD, LeBron and Harden when in reality he is 2 or 3 tiers below them.   LBJ,KD,Curry,Giannis, Harden  Dame, Jokic, Embidd, Kawhi, Luka  AD, CP3, Butler,  Tatum, Mitchell   I wouldn't be mad if you put him in tier three ( over Mitchell) but I think he's more of a tier four guy"
"If he played today he'd have to work to get that 3pt% over 40% if he would want to be offensively effective and efficient to be anywhere near GOAT potential. I don't think people remember just how many shots he took and how poorly that would translate today.  Transport 2001 AI to 2021 and we're essentially looking at a 5'11"" Westbrook who shoots 10 times more a game, or Kyrie Irving with less range and is torpedoing himself into centers 10 times a game.   Plus organizations are holding him out of games constantly instead of letting him play through everything he used to, so he's either missing a ton of time or that aggressiveness to the hole would have to be reigned in."
"And how many games did Jordan miss due to injury? Or “load management”? Still lost in the first round  If you’re referring to the two Houston championships, Jordan was playing baseball up until about a month before the 95 playoffs AND STILL MADE THE SECOND ROUND!  And I’ll give Lebron credit that Cavs run was his best, but let’s be honest the Warriors lost that series more so than Cleveland won it.  If Draymond Green doesn’t get suspended, they more than likely win that series.   And like I said “with the exception of Rodman”, but are you seriously comparing an end of his career Ron. Harper and Steve Kerr to guys like Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, AD, Kyrie Irving?  And Harper and Kerr were brought in BEFORE Jordan returned.  And I say Lebron disappeared because he made it to the finals what 11-12 times?  AND ONLY WON 4 so that means he lost more than he won WITH MOSTLY SUPERTEAMS.  And if you bring up that first Cavs team he took to the finals that was in one of the weakest eastern conference in years.   And the fact that you can list 4 years Lebron didn’t show up in the finals proves my point because answer this, name a time Jordan got to the finals and didn’t deliver."
"Do you have a source on that? I can't find anything on Google that says he got the second assessment when he first injured it (which was against the TWolves, not the Cavs). The Love collision was in the playoffs, which was the re-aggravation.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/8/26/16209064/isaiah-thomas-hip-injury-kyrie-irving-trade-void"

"You're going to outshoot Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden in a 7 game series? Heavy doubt"
Get both bands back together. Russell Westbrook for Kyrie Irving. Who says no? Aside from Lebron of course.
The Bucks sacrificed their future to try and win and if it weren't for Kyrie Irving getting injured...they would be in the same boat as another 2nd round exit. Anything can happen in this league.
"Round 1 - Rondo: His goal has never been to outscore the opposing PG. His job is to facilitate and get the W’s which he did. Bulls had a 2-0 lead and the only reason why Isaiah Thomas got past the 1st round and not labeled as a choker was because Rondo suffered a fractured right thumb in Game 2.  Round 2 - John Wall: He’s more of a facilitator as well with his usual double doubles. Also, he had to feed Bradley Beal. That’s the only reason why he didn’t score more than IT.  Round 3 - Kyrie Irving: LeBron had the ball most of the time. Kyrie still did his thing more efficiently than IT and negated whatever IT contributed. Most importantly, he got the W.  For the playoff guards out West, we all know those guys would dominate IT in playoff situations. They don’t wake up for the Celtics no matter what their seed was because they could back down the PG any day and kill him on switches."
"13: Curry :  Curry has never won with his athleticism. Even at age 33, he’ll still be the best shooter in the world and one of the NBA’s most electric players with the ball in his hands. I don’t see any way how Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, or even Russell Westbrook is going to pass him up over the next four years."
"Nets GM Sean Marks said that the Nets are talking to Kyrie Irving and James Harden about contract extensions.   Marks said he is “confident” by the time training camp starts, Brooklyn’s ‘Big 3’ will be under contract with the Nets long-term. Durant already signed his extension."
"2019 is probably be the goat offseason. 2016-18 were all pretty crazy too but 2019 was nuts  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   Kemba Walker   ALL switched teams, and more then a few of them were pretty unpredictable"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"if you’re trying to imply you thought kyrie irving was a head case before that trade, that’s your opinion of him. he no longer wanted to play in cleveland and he had his reasons.   his value still made that trade worth it at the time. it’s just too easy to say it was the wrong move when we now know how his tenure in boston went."
that’s hindsight tho.   if you have the opportunity to flip IT and colin sexton for kyrie irving you’re making that trade 10/10 times.
"&gt; edit: to put that in context, Paul Pierce and Kyrie Irving have each made 2nd team only once. Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, and Klay Thompson have never done it.  that should tell you more about how weird selections are than about how good he must have been"
Not only did they make the obvious upgrade of Kyrie Irving they traded IT to the Cavaliers to play alongside fucking LEBRON JAMES what a tragic exile the celtics forced him into. FOH
"We basically do send our best 12 every year. Stats wise, 4 out of the top ppg leaders in the NBA post season were on the team. Outside of players being retired, usually we do have our best players. It's sort of difficult to know if Chris Paul or Russel Westbrook should be playing in front of Dillard. And Kyrie Irving should definitely not have been on this team. LeBron is retired from international basketball I believe. I think the only one who did not play that should have was Anthony Davis."
"The first season he played for the celtics he made that team better and they were predicted to take the warriors to 7 games before his injury. The inconsistency of the 2019 Celtics had no business making the postseason. You seemed to have skipped over the part where I added kyrie was dropping 30+ in losses because nobody wanted to step up. Again, will never understand how any Celtics fan expected that team to do damage in the playoffs. All year long it was the locker room cancer narratives, team was bound to implode.   Again, he was 21 years old? Not even Lebron could lead that team that’s why he left. Why don’t you go ahead and take your own advice and see how dumb and flawed your argument has been.   You’re delusional if you believe Jayson &amp; Jaylen are even on par with Kyrie Irving right now. In case you aren’t educated kyrie’s coming off of a 50/40/90 year taking 20.1 shot attempts a game. Also has a ring he earned averaging 27ppg in the finals.   Stop running away from the fact that Westbrook hasn’t done anything being the best player on his team so your original statement made no sense."
"Let’s set the record straight really quick:  Ain’t nobody wanna hear the truth in this subreddit but imma let it out anyways. I will always love Isaiah Thomas, he put his heart and soul on the floor every single night for the Celtics and quite possibly ended his career in the hopes of a championship that season, and for everything that he went through over the last two years of his Celtics tenure I feel absolutely awful.   But let’s not get it twisted, literally any org in the entire league would’ve made that trade back then 1000x over; trade an undersized point guard that publicly was asking for a Brinks truck in the off-season for an in his prime hungry for “his own ring” Kyrie Irving. No one would ever not make that deal. Today if the exact same situation were to come up just with different players, no matter what team it is they would do it 100%.   That being said we’re definitely cursed from it and who knows when the curse will end. I’d love to sign him this year and give him the opportunity to show out and prove his worth, but I’m not Brad Stevens or Zarren. I’ll never stop rooting for the guy either way. This video absolutely broke my heart and I really hope he finds his footing somewhere, whether that be on the Celtics, elsewhere in the NBA, or in other leagues."
*Kyrie Irving has entered the chat*
"Look at Patty Mills, balled the fuck at the Olympics with 40 points in the bronze medal game against Slovenia and now he’s going to sit on the bench in Brooklyn and watch James Harden and Kyrie Irving"
he is better than james harden and kyrie irving
They let everyone in the HOF. Do you really think Kyrie Irving won’t be in the HOF? He’s basically a lock tbh.
Don’t have to. Kyrie Irving
"My man, you are clearly not understand me corectly.  The way how you talk about James, I only hear the same talk from people who do not understand basketball, and most of them admit that they are casuals. And since you find yourself in my words, well...sorry man.  Also, casuals watch ESPN and all those fake sports shows on TV, who glorify what brings them money. If you want to know anything about basketball stop watching ESPN.  Regarding your talk about what happened, I know what happend I watched all those games.   Now, for my words, even the most skilled center of all time agrees with me:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xj0zNOV1nw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xj0zNOV1nw)  Jordan was lockdown defender and best defender on the court in most times, while also carrying an offense, scoring around 30 points.  He played with only one all star teammate.   He has the most scoring titles with 10, and he is only player with Wilt Chambrlain to win them seven times in the row. For this I am not quite sure, but he is one of only two players who won scoring title and championship in the same season.  He played all 82 games seven times and 78 or more in 11 of those 13   seasons, finishing top-three in MVP voting in all of them, save for his    rookie season. The Bulls made the playoffs in each of Jordan’s prime    years. In his prime, Jordan averaged 33.4 points (56.8 true    shooting percentage), 6.4 rebounds, 5.7 assists and three combined    blocks and steals in 41.8 minutes over 179 playoff games. His Bulls made    the Eastern Conference finals in each of his final eight full seasons,    winning titles in the last six of them. Jordan also has the most blocks for guard in NBA with 828, and second is Wade with 804. He also has the most steals on sg position. He was death island on offense and defense, while same cannot be said for James. Jordan also has the most blocks for guard in NBA with 828, and second is Wade with 804. He also has the most steals on sg position. He was death island on offense and defense, while same cannot be said for James.  Michael Jordan never lost three games in the row from 1991 to 1998. That is something that Lebron will never achieve. He also won far more in less time and he still has more individual and team trophies then Lebron. He played both sides of the court, all time. He is 6 0 in finals. He averaged over 40 points in 93 finals against Phoenix. And so far as assists and rebounds go, when Jordan played a short stint as point guard on Bulls in 1991 season, last 41 games, he achieved these stats:  He averaged 32.2 points, 9.4 assists and 8.3 rebounds in 41 regular-season and playoff games as the Bulls' point guard, and that stretch included a streak of seven consecutive triple-doubles.  Jordan never left for another team, especially not to team up with anybody to win championship. He used what was given to him, and used it to perfecton. He would not be where he is if wasnt for Scottie Pippen, who was beast of a player, especially on defensive end, and later he would play with another defensive beast in Dennis Rodman. First he won one triple, and later on another. Lebron James played with Bosh and Wade, two players in their prime, and they didnt won triple. Now he has Antonio Davis and Russel Westbrook. Also Kyrie Irving is worth mentioning.  Also, Lebron James plays in era of fast offense, where players score more points, have more rebounds and assists. Especially with modern day offense where one player dominates the ball as soon it leaves opponents team hands, and that makes stats more inflated then they should really be. And for defense, when hand checking is removed, it become easier to score in the paint, since defenders couldnt place hands on player they are guarding above three point line, it is always nowdays automatic faul; heck, like that is from 2005 or something.  All these are facts that you can check.  Its just foul analogy to compare Jordan and Lebron.  I am not bashing Lebron. I am not the one who will say ""Ray Allen won Lebron championship"" or same for Irving. I am well aware that he is one of the best basketball players that I ever seen, especially in that 2012/2013 season. That 2016 comeback I consider the best comeback of all time. It was pleasure to watch those games.  If you don't agree with me, thats fine man. Its basketball talk."
I have a hard time believing this sub collectively hates Kyrie Irving more than Patrick Beverly.

"You’re forgetting the part where Kemba Walker is a significantly inferior player in every possible way to Kyrie Irving lol, stop acting like they’re comparable.

"Ultimately, as a result of trading Pierce, Garnett, Jason Terry, and DJ White, the Celtics have gotten:  * Marcus Smart 6th overall in the 2014 draft (this was the Celtics' own pick, but it is unlikely they would've been drafting 6th if they kept their core)  * Jaylen Brown (pick from Nets)  * Jayson Tatum (pick from Nets, traded to 76ers for 3rd overall pick and 2019 15th overall pick)  *  2018 8th overall pick Colin Sexton (traded to Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving)  * Romeo Langford  The ***only*** thing I fault Ainge for and felt was completely boneheaded in the moment was giving an aging undersized guard a 4 year $141M contract.  Other than that, I can't really think of anything he did wrong.  Hayward was an awful contract but at the time of the signing it seemed great.  And I don't put much stock into ""rumors"" that don't pan out, because none of us are in these front offices, and I would bet that over 80% of NBA rumors are complete BS made up either by reporters or GMs just as a smokescreen."
Kyrie irving.
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.

I don't remember the last time a wing player has ever been able to contest a Kyrie Irving shot:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maw81LpW1vs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maw81LpW1vs)     Again, Trae Young making mockeries of taller defenders:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-WTWaYyjbo     Modern NBA moves like hesitations, fadeaways and floaters absolutely make height much much less both offensively and defensively.  If you really think 1 inch in height makes a difference, then Luka would not be in Lebron's league as a passer because he's 3"" shorter."
I think Kyrie gets a couple too. In 1v1s though how many times have you been locked up on the perimeter? You can be locked up going to the hoop but the perimeter is wide open. I’m just trusting Curry is gonna knock more 3pt shots than Irving
"Going off your first two paragraphs its clear you dont understand what efficiency is at all. Ai averaged 33 on **30 attempts per game** on really supar TS% even relatively for his era when it isnt that high. I'm taking harden averaging 31 on better efficiency and 6 less shots over ai doing that on 30 attempts per game lol  &gt; why did he fold as soon as CP3 went down?  Fold? So you're telling me if ai was in this same situation he's beating arguably the greatest team ever by himself? The same team that beat lebron (who's a top 2 player ever) and kyrie irving (was better than cp3) in 5 and beat lebron by himself in 4 games?   &gt; As with Harden, nothing I’ve seen from him in the playoffs as the number 1 option gives me any confidence that he could make finals appearances in that era and ain’t no way he carrying that same sixer team to the finals lol, AI was just different  I'm just positive you just ignored his 2018 playoff run for you to say he cant win as a number 1 option. Also again if you put in that weak eastern conference no defender back this is stopping him in that conference consistently and he's the definitive best player in that conference hands down (unless you for some reason would argue a prime kidd is better than Houston Harden)"
It was always Irving. IT was really good and a great story but there's no question Kyrie was viewed as a better and more valuable player.
"I'd rather have a healthy Kyle Lowry than an injured Kyrie Irving.   I don't give a shit how good he is when he's missed more playoffs due to injury than he's actually finished.   Look, I had this conversation when he got traded to Boston. Boston fans down voted me and said the same thing you said.   Guess what happened. He missed the playoffs, and they did better without him than with him.   Then he signed with BK.   I said the signing was a mistake because Kyrie wouldn't likely not even be around for the playoffs.   People down voted me.   Guess what happened.   Then this, year, when people were saying that Nets were the odds on favorites, I said it was more likely that Kyrie goes down with an injury than they get to the finals.   I got down voted.   Guess what happened.   His finished the playoffs on the injury list.   Again.   Who gives a shit how fancy a dude can dribble when he's more likely to finish the playoffs on the injury list than playing?   His skills do no good for a team when he isn't on the court.   Period.   2015: Injured.   2018: Injured.  2020: Injured.  2021: Injured  That three years he played, and four years he missed.   He's currently more likely to missed the post season than finish it.   That's a reality.   Anybody who ignores that when trying to put a contender together doesn't deserve to be a GM.   The only rationale for signing Kyrie is to make sure you get KD, and not that he's locked in... well... you can cut Kyrie loose.      I'm not saying he isn't great. I'm saying it doesn't matter because you can't count on him being healthy."
"Most of the current top NBA players are from the US. The list is subjective, but I would say about 14-15 of the current top 20, or 19-20 out of the top 25 are from the US. If we were to make a team from these players, then the US team would have more depth for sure.  &amp;nbsp;  If you want to list them, in no particular order: LBJ, Durant, Curry, Harden, Leonard, AD, Lillard, Beal, Tatum, Butler, KAT, Chris Paul, PG, Booker, Irving. To 25: Holiday, Adebayo, Mitchell, Randle, Zion.  The European players are Jokic, Antetokounmpo, Doncic, Gobert. The remaining players not from the US or Europe are Embiid and Simmons, and Kyrie Irving has dual US-Australian citizenship.  &amp;nbsp;  Just some lists from media outlets for comparison: [[1]](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/5/4/22416337/top-25-nba-player-ranking-lebron-james-nikola-jokic), [[2]](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/2021-ranking-top-20-nba-players-right-now), and [top 100 if you want a larger sample size](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/14/top-100-nba-players-2021-daily-cover)"
"How many play off games did Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving play without Lebron?      If the East was ""pretty crappy"" and Kyrie couldn't even make the playoffs, how much of a number 1 guy was he?       Lebron beat the team with the best record in history, and lead every player in every statistical category for the series. &lt;- There is no greater achievement in basketball history. It can literally only be matched, not topped.      Lebron has won a championship with 3 completely different franchises. Each time he leaves a franchise, they absolutely crater. Where as Jordan's team were still good the year after his retirement.      Lebron has longevity, availability, and the higher individual peak. He's a significantly better passer and a better rebounder. Could guard 1-5. Similar scorers on a night to night basis even if Jordan has a slight edge.  Lebron may coast in the regular season but he can throw out a near 40 point triple double on command."
"Nets Big 4: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Patty Mills.  Don't even need a 5th guy."
"“Free agent Kyrie Irving is meeting with the Brooklyn Nets in New York on Sunday and both sides are motivated to move quickly toward reaching a 4-year, $141M deal, league sources tell ESPN.”"
Kyrie Irving game 7 finals winner
Bron would have 2 titles without Kyrie Irving and ray allen LOL
"Kyrie Irving, he makes his own words."
He wants to go to a contender so the only realistic locations/packages would be...  To the Clippers for Paul George  To the Lakers for Russell Westbrook  To the Nuggets for Jamal Murray  To the Suns for Chris Paul  To the Nets for Kyrie Irving  To the 76ers for Ben Simmons  To the Celtics for Jaylen Brown  I doubt half of these deals would ever happen tho. Philly seems the most realistic.
"This dude Patty is about to be on the same team as Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and KD.....  May god bless the east"
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
"And Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Paul George, etc."
"It seems like you're confusing the difference between skill and physicality. Given the less physical defense today, players are as skilled as ever today. They took what other players did before them and added shit to it. For example, Kyrie Irving is one of the most skilled guards in the NBA today and he wouldn't be nearly as successful in the 90s  because of the physical defense."
"I know where it’s from, I wasnt responding to the picture. My statement stands on its own and is still true. Really try to think about how a discussion works next time.   KD’s played with Westbrook, Harden, Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Kyrie Irving and still has two less rings than Bron"
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.  Starters:  Bradley Beal  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Others:  Jaylen Brown  James Harden  Julius Randle  Mike Conley Jr.  Brandon Ingram  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Zion Williamson

Wait so a team got Kyrie Irving and James Harden AS A FAVOR to another player?  I wonder why no other front office thought of this. Nets would be so much better off if KD wasn’t so selfish and forced us to get two top 15 play
Kyrie irving… but the opposite way.
"Power duo of Grayson Allen and Giannis ""Literally murdered Kyrie Irving in cold blood"" Antetokounmpo"
Kyrie Irving = MyKnee Hurting
"and if we had james harden and kyrie irving it wouldn’t have mattered, your point?"
Except Kyrie Irving is much better than Westbrook you dolt lmao. You probably think the 2014 Heat were a super team LOL
"yep, defensive perception rises and falls with narrative. When a shit defensive player gets offensive accolades or has a great offensive season, suddenly people say, actually he's much better on defense than people think. See: Harden, James; Irving, Kyrie; Lavine, Zachary; Booker, Devin; Westbrook Russell; Jokic, Nikola, etc etc. Not all of those guys are equally bad, but what they have in common is their were suddenly considered improved defenders after monster offensive seasons. Do we really believe that's true? C'mon."
"Curry  Luka  Lillard  Trae   CP3  Kyrie Irving  Fox  Morant  Holiday  Murray  Harden and Shai are both listed as SG's (I know Harden at least is just lying about that label) so if they're counted Harden slots in at 2, and Shai would be ahead of Morant. OP what did De'Aaron Fox ever do to you?"
It's actually funny but imagine Simmons going to the Nets for Kyrie Irving.
Kyrie Irving &amp; James Harden are older injury prone players that havent done anything in the playoffs in a while lol
kyrie irving just isn't that good of a player
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity
"I understand your point, but I am going to have to disagree with you. There is more than one way to skin a cat. The Warriors roster is led by veterans in Curry, Klay, Green, Looney, and Wiggins. The first four of whom have been together for a long time and gone through championships.  To say that a team cannot compete for a title with young players on the roster seems short-sighted and oversimplified. The Suns were very young this past year and made the finals (Ayton, CamJohn, and even Booker is pretty young). These players were starters. The Warriors young guys are back of the rotation players.   in 2020 the Heat had Bam starting in the finals in his third season.  in 2019 the Raptors had Siakam as a key part of the team in his third season. Same with VanVleet.   Kevon Looney played significant minutes on a finals team in both 2018 and 2019 after struggling through injuries his first two seasons.   Pat McCaw played spot minutes for the Warriors in 2017 and 2018 in the playoffs in his first two years.   Kyrie Irving was the 2nd best player on a finals team from his age 22-24 seasons.   Again, I understand your point. LeBron likes having vets around him. But from an organizational standpoint, another strategy is to compete now, but also not sell out the future if you can avoid doing so. A blend of vets and young players can build dynasties as seen with the Spurs and Warriors. A team of only vets often results in ""championship or bust"" and after the vets leave or retire the team is awful (2013-15 Nets, 2015-18 Cavs, 2013 Lakers, 2019-20 Rockets, etc.).   Just because the Celtics have not won a championship does not mean that the strategy to have vets and young players on the same team does not work. It just did not work for them, yet. They are also a perennial playoff team and Tatum and Brown have developed into stars in their own right."

Day to Dayvis and Kyrie IRving
Who exactly are Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook supposed to be? Are they not all future HOF locks lmao?  The moment you even said that dumb shit you invalidated you’re entire point.   Social media didn’t create shit. A lot of us weren’t born in 2003 and actually grew up getting to watch both Jordan and Lebron lol
"I lost all respect I had left for him after this comment. I genuinely hate him as a person now. How he can teach anyone about history in such a condescending way while using shady Twitter accounts as sources all the while never having touched a real history book and be kinda antisemitic at the same time. I'm still baffled how anyone let him say that. If he were Meyers Leonard and not Kyrie Irving, his career would just be over"
"&gt; for a lottery team in Cleveland, granted they added Love  this is so disingenuous. lebron fucking james isn't leaving the miami heat to go to a lottery team. he went to a team with kyrie irving, a top 10 point guard and all-star talent and kevin love, a top 5 power forward of the time. if you really think you can convince people lebron went to a shitty team after he left that shitty team years prior, you're just biased.  he leaves teams when he sees he can be in better situations. that's it. point blank. not much to it. it's a knock on him legacy-wise  lebron is a helocentric player, just like harden is, when teams who have one guy who does pretty much everything on offense leave they will obviously falter since the whole roster is created to maximize the guys talents. it's no coincidence that the rockets and cavs sucked after the 1 guy left because that 1 guy was literally their whole system  that's not a knock on lebron but it's not some gotcha moment when the whole roster was top to bottom created to bolster his game. why would you have a ball dominant star player next to harden/bron when all they need are spot up shooters in the corner who can defend and rebound?"
"Calling Kyrie Irving and a healthy Kevin Love ""role players"" is definitely insulting lol."
"They don’t need kyrie irving, but if he can’t hit 3s at a respectable clip, teams are just gonna ignore him on offense.  He’s been abysmal."
Why I think Kyrie Irving has been circumcised…despite many people telling me he hasn’t
Kyrie fuckin Irving
Kyrie Irving on the Nets is going to be a problem with this I’m sure
"Obviously LBJ has had some terrific help from players like AD, Kyrie Irving and Wade, but Jordan literally had Pippen and Rodman, which were both pretty good. Kobe won the majority of his championships with a stacked Lakers with Shaq.   That's the thing. Everyone of them had help from other people. It's what happens when a star comes to your team- you build a roster around him.   The whole 'who do you want to take the shot' thing is absolutely biased and obviously the only way to take a GOAT claim seriously is by looking at the statistics of the player rather than championships and 'legacy'."
Kyrie Irving special
We’re excited about a 2nd year PG with a lot of upside who gives us everything our starting PG doesn’t have.  Nobody from Philly is acting like he’s Kyrie Irving in a serious manner.
Can we all just shut the fuck up about Tyrese Maxey already   Dude will be lucky to be a serviceable starter this year and Sixers fans act like he’s Kyrie Irving
Almost certainly Kyrie Irving. I can’t see anybody stopping him in that setting.
"Ok, I didn’t think this needed to be said, but the thing Steph has that Joe doesn’t is volume. Both kyrie and Steph are extremely talented volume scorers. Both are historically great. Just because the cavs beat the warriors once everybody wants to go on and on about how kyrie Irving is their pops. Yes, it was fucking fantastic, historic performances typically are. Stephen Curry is a slightly better finisher, that’s my argument, if you tell me to go watch Kyries highlights then I’ll just say go watch Steph’s. Also, ok great, so what lebron defended Steph? Kyrie has been held to bad outings by good defenders, the nba isn’t frozen in the 2016 finals."
Kyrie Irving is more skilled than KD. KD just shoot better.
Yes because Kyrie Irving has never had a bad game before right? He’s basketball Jesus basically
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.

"More than average:  Wilt: Lakers, 76ers, Kings, Pistons, Knicks, Wizards   Jordan: Trailblazers, Jazz, Suns, Bucks, Spurs, Hornets, Celtics, Rockets, Cavaliers   LeBron James: Bulls  Adrian Dantley: Mavericks  Kyrie Irving: Pelicans  Allen Iverson: Raptors   George Gervin: Clippers  Kevin Durant: Thunder, Warriors    ——————-  Less than average:  Jordan: Heat, Nets, Pacers, Hawks, Magic, Nuggets, Timberwolves   Durant: Grizzlies"
"Worst / least accurate take was that the Celtics would become a borderline dynasty following their first ECF appearance.   They made it to the ECF led by a super short point guard playing his heart out, had some great young players thanks to the Nets, then traded for Kyrie Irving, signed Gordan Hayward, and drafted Tatum 3rd overall.  Imagine adding Kyrie Irving, pre-injured Gordan Hayward, and having the top 3 draft pick the offseason following an ECF appearance.  Then the first disaster hit, Hayward gets hurt game 1 then Kyrie gets hurt before playoffs BUT THEY STILL MAKE IT TO THE ECF and take freaking Lebron to game 7 led by a freaking rookie.   It makes complete sense to assume they'd be a dynasty by 2021... things just didn't work out"
"Bonus drama points to him for being teammates with the following players before: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and even Shaq.  &amp;nbsp;  Having an opinion as an ex-teammate of LeBron James itself will get clicks. But along with that he's also a teammate of all the guys above and a lot of them either had beef with others there or have fanbases that have had rivalries/beefs with one of the other fanbases. Examples: LBJ fans vs KD fans, LBJ vs Kyrie, KD and his fans vs WB and his fans, Harden fans vs Westbrook fans, LeBron and his fans vs Celtics and their fans, LeBron and Ray Allen vs Celtics, LeBron vs Pierce, Ray Allen vs Rondo, etc.   &amp;nbsp;  There's plenty more headlines and drama I haven't even listed yet but Kendrick brands himself as someone who can provide unique, locker room insight, so it gets more juicy for drama lovers (especially when he's forced to pick a side)"

"It's a joke dude. It's what the guy wants, not what he thinks is actually gonna happen. Just like how everyone hated KD on the Warriors and wished he'd sit out, but people weren't actually saying they wished he'd get injured. He meaning that it has is that they don't want Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving playing on the same team because it should be easy championships. The guy was straight up asked if he wanted a player injury, and he responded with no. Idk what more you want than that."
Kyrie Irving and PG  Footwork and handles is what makes watching them so smooth.   It's what today's players don't work on enough. Footwork adds so much flow to your game.   Watching Hakeem was such a cool experience.

"Giannis eliminating Kyrie was also nowhere part of the series.  But yes who could have possibly predicted Kyrie Irving, of all people, would be injured?"
"That doesn't even do it justice. He was 11th in the league among qualified players in TS% at 65.5% and the only guard in the top 20. The top 10 is almost exclusively 3pt specialists such as Joe Harris and MPJ or lob threats such as Gobert and Zubac.   The only player in the top 10 who could be considered a first option is KD who only played 35 games and had some of the best spacing in the league with Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving and James Harden to space the floor for him. Steph had the worst spacing in the whole league, was double, triple and even quadruple teamed and still won the scoring title on insane efficiency."
"Rose appeared to be able to force his way to the basket at will, and I believe Lillard is unable to do so.  He'd string together a series of herky-jerky manoeuvres that would render the defence helpless.  He was one of the explosive athletic combo-guards of the 2010s, alongside John Wall, Kyrie Irving, and the manner he moved on the court was so modernized.  He truly had a good feel for the game. I don’t know what it was about him specifically but he just played the game his way."
What about LeBron and Kyrie irving?
"&gt;15 years from now people will look back on the conversations that are had around here every day in horror at how bigoted much of what gets said is.  I think we'll realize that closet ""progressive people"" on this sub used their ""well if I shit on Americans I can still support the foreign white person with coded language, and remain ""progressive"""" paradigm over and over again.  To wit - we all *know* you shouldn't be saying Kevin Love is more ""classy"" than Kyrie Irving (if you believe that).  But it's totally fine to say Jokic is, because, European White."

He did it three and a half years into a 5 year deal. James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, etc These guys have all done the same thing in recent years. Can you tell me who their agents are?"
Kyrie Irving
1. Kyrie Irving will retire with multiple 50-40-90 seasons.  2. The Wizards will be mocked for passing on Alperen Sengun.
"When you take a step back it's even kind of weird to have a strong feeling about a professional player - like, these millionaires don't know you, they don't care about you, and here you are wasting your whole Thursday night arguing with another weirdo on Twitter because he put Klay Thompson above Kyrie Irving on his ""GOAT Players I Would Fuck If I Was Gay (I'm Not Gay)"" list.  But having strong feelings about a fucking agent? What are you doing? You can't play in a Fantasy Agent League. If there's a video game where you simulate being an agent, I bet it sucks ass. At least stanning for a player makes the smallest amount of sense, because they're cool and can do things you can't. Agents are just regular ass dudes."
"I might get slaughtered by my fellow Celtics fans but Kyrie Irving. Loved his game before he went to Boston, still love his game now."

"We really do appreciate everything he did for us, especially for playing after his sister's death and through injuries.  If Danny keeps him for the season, lets him walk for nothing, the reports come out that we could've gotten Kyrie Irving for IT and now everyone blames DA for not getting a return. Public opinion: He's a bad executive  If Danny gives him the money he is looking for, he begins his downward trend from his MVP season and the future of our team is in the water. Public Opinion: Danny is a bad executive.  If Danny trades him, he's a horrible person because of everything IT has done for us. Public Opinion: Danny is a bad executive.  You see how in every avenue we take, the celtics FO looks bad. So why would we not choose the best option available, which makes us look equally as bad but in a different way?  You guys continuously bring up how the Celtics FO has let players like Kyrie and Gordon Hayward walk for nothing, but when we do trade a player, you blame the FO for being scumbags and making a phenomenal basketball decision. It's heartless, but every executive in the league would've done the deal."
"&gt; NBA agent Rich Paul says he warned the Boston Celtics about trading for Anthony Davis for their own good.   &gt;Paul told ESPN’s Dave McMenamin — in a report Tuesday about how the All-NBA big man’s blockbuster deal from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Los Angeles Lakers went down — **that he tried to persuade other suiters, like the Celtics, against mortgaging their future for Davis.**  &gt; “The last thing you want to do is put a GM in a situation where he trades away an asset and then the guy walks out the door,” he said. “Like, you can’t do business that way. So it’s not really a hard conversation to have.”  &gt; Paul — who represents a number of high-profile stars, including Davis and his new Lakers teammate LeBron James — **had made it clear at the time that his 26-year-old client would likely leave in free agency next summer if the Celtics acquired him from the Pelicans.**  &gt;“I don’t think it stopped Danny Ainge from trying,” he told ESPN.  &gt;The Celtics had tried to compete with the Lakers’ trade offers last June and some fans urged the team to go all in for Davis, a franchise-caliber talent. Ainge has reportedly coveted the six-time All-Star for years. However, according to Paul, he ultimately “wasn’t willing to give up the young players.” While the Celtics were reportedly open to trading some combination of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Marcus Smart, they weren’t willing to match the package of players and draft picks that the Lakers ultimately sent to the Pelicans for Davis — especially if he might leave Boston after one season.   &gt;“I don’t blame him,” Paul said. “I wouldn’t give them up either if the guy is not going to re-sign.”  &gt;Davis had narrowed his preferred destinations to the Lakers and the New York Knicks — and Paul pushed to make sure other teams knew that. **David Griffin, the Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations, told ESPN that Paul “had done such an effective job of smoking out all of the competition” that the team realized they wouldn’t get a better deal than what had been offered by the Lakers.**  &gt;**In May, Paul told Sports Illustrated that the Celtics could trade for Davis, “but it’ll be for one year.” Shortly after Davis first requested a trade in February, his father also spoke out against the idea of his son playing for the Celtics, “after what they [had] done to Isaiah Thomas,” who was traded for Kyrie Irving while recovering from a hip injury he sustained during the 2017 playoffs, which derailed his career.**  &gt;Paul didn’t express opposition to the concept of Davis playing for the Celtics, but said he made the risk clear to the team.  &gt;“**If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020,” he told SI. “I’ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don’t blame Rich Paul.”**  The 'Ainge has no loyalty' narrative was steaming hot at this time and the quote was used at the perfect time when Celtics seemed ready to finally pull the trigger on AD now that it was clear he wasn't staying in New Orleans. Just seems awfully coincidental."
"There was an article last year (October 2020) that surveyed agents across the NBA anonymously, and one highlighted all this stuff a while back and went into some detail. [Here](https://theathletic.com/2143454/2020/10/22/nba-agent-survey-part-two-lebron-james-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-best-player/?amp) is the source, but because it's behind a paywall I've copied the relevant part.  &gt; “The worst thing that LeBron is doing is forcing this power with Rich Paul and what that is, in terms of, he’s a player, but he has prowess in the media space. His company Spring Hill, that’s awesome. Doing the movies and all of the projects. That’s so commendable. I love that. But now that they’ve jumped into the agent game, which the reality is, it’s illegal for a player, particularly if you’re in the state of California, to be licensed to represent talent.  &gt; “Now I know it’s this façade that it’s Rich Paul, but it’s really LeBron who recruits for Rich Paul. So it’s almost like they’re trying to control AAU at the NBA level. This is my AAU team and they’ve carried that to the highest level. And because of his power and his prowess, people, the young players are seduced by LeBron James in the same way people were seduced by Michael Jordan with David Falk. He went from having Michael Jordan and a few other players, to getting the top players in the NBA, because of the Jordan factor. Rob Pelinka had tremendous success as an independent agent because he had Kobe Bryant and the players idolized him. **So, the fact that LeBron recruits and has empowered Rich Paul, and I get it, on the top guys, but if someone does their research, a lot of these guys have really gotten screwed, a large number of them, by mismanagement.**  &gt; “**There’s at least five or six massive casualties.** Nobody is saying anything and you can even say that the union should take some responsibility because they represent all of the players, not just LeBron James. Because this is anonymous. I hope you have the courage to put this out there, because nobody is talking about this but this is the reality, and if you ask any other agent what I just said, they would all agree.  &gt; “**They’ve been able to leverage KCP, two or three years in a row because they have the power and they’re forcing it down their throat. Nerlens Noel. There are four or five of them that have suffered millions of dollars from mismanagement** but nobody has the courage to support it, because all the media wants access to LeBron. They want access to AD.  &gt; “What he’s done is he’s taking AAU basketball to the NBA, because he has the ability to do that because these young players idolize him. I’m starting to hear some rumblings that they might be overloaded. Because you can’t have this level of expectation for a client and service all of these guys. Ben Simmons. Garland. I know this as an agent, you can’t service them all at this level. You can seduce them, but you can’t service them all, at that level with what they say they’re doing. **Nerlens Noel. Norris Cole. Shabazz Muhammed. They lost $80 million in Detroit. This is real talk.**  &gt; “That’s the only disappointment is LeBron has leveraged his popularity with young players for seducing them for Klutch and it’s not serving all the players well. But for the players that are suffering, there’s no repercussions. Nobody is criticizing what they’re doing. And you have to call out the union. They should be meeting with Rich Paul, saying, ‘What happened here? What happened here? They represent all the players. They all pay the same amount for dues. If Rich Paul were a lawyer, he’d be disbarred five times. But because LeBron is so powerful, there is no accountability. And that’s the only bad part with LeBron. Everything else is great. It’s commendable. It’s progressive. I love it. The part that he’s pushed Rich Paul in this position and these naïve basketball players, that’s pretty egregiously irresponsible.”"

"He has more All-NBA defense nods than anyone ever. He was guarding the other team’s #1 option on defense, while being the primary ball handler on offense.  Kobe gets so much flack for playing with Shaq, but imagine any other player being All-NBA defense while also putting up 30ppg. It’s like Paul George, mixed with Jimmy Butler, mixed with Kyrie Irving, and then some.   Shaq played for a while before Kobe became great and never won the finals before that. Kobe deserves more respect for their wins because obviously Shaq isn’t winning with just anyone."

Kyrie Irving is better than Steph Curry..... SMH
"A couple years ago my wife said she was a Cav's fan so I asked her to name 2 players besides Lebron.    ""Kyrie Irving and Kevin Hart."""
You mean all that for two years of Kyrie Irving which lead to two years of Kemba Walker on a bigger contract?
"We literally did. We have Isaiah Thomas (who’s not in the league), Jae Crowder, and the pick that became Colin Sexton for Kyrie Irving.  You’re the casual"
Boston won the Kyrie Irving trade
I think the dominant narrative is that the dude plays with James Harden and Kyrie Irving and a guy who shot 47.5% from 3 as a 4th option.
"Zach Lowe, Bill Simmons, Charles Barkley and Kyrie Irving."
"What does “bad” mean?   If it’s just based on individual statistics, Kyrie Irving has never had a bad season."

**Breaking News:** Kyrie Irving requests trade to the Phoenix Suns
Lebrons legacy is saved from ray allen and Kyrie Irving.
"&gt; The Bagels traded Bruce Brown, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, a 2023 1st round pick, and a 2025 1st round pick to the Cyclones for Bam Adebayo, Dewayne Dedmon, and Kyle Lowry.  Lol, thanks Brooklyn."
Kyrie Irving - flat earth joke. What a creatively funny guy.
Kyrie Irving 3 in Game 7. Thought it was a terrible shot at the time. When it went in it was like a shock to the system. About 3 minutes of bricks broken up by that.
"Yes I watched the whole fucking series. I mean the Bucks played what came in front of them. The calculated risk is Irving, not Harden. Asking Kyrie to be healthy for that series is like hoping that the sun won't rise. Although I suppose you could call it another calculated risk to rely on Harden to seize the moment in the playoffs, which he's so used to not doing. Hobbling around on one leg would at least offer a shooter a chance to be a threat, especially for Milwaukee which was leaving some very open spots past the three point line."
u know there are stats for this bro   https://nbacourtoptix.nba.com/en  some of yall say shit just to say shit.   kyrie irving is the 18th most doubled player in the league. he faced a double around 19 times a game this season. neither harden nor durant were top 20.
"No shit. But you don’t assemble a team with Kyrie Irving, KD off an Achilles tear, and Blake Griffin getting huge minutes expecting for everyone to be healthy."
"LeBron will still be a top 20 player in 5 years (age 41-42 season)  Devonte' Graham will average close to 10 assists and shoot over 40% on very high volume from deep playing next to Zion Williamson.  Ben Simmons figures it out on his next team, and averages 23/8/8 whenever he's traded.  Kyrie Irving signs his 4 year extension with the Nets, but randomly decides to retire 1 or 2 years into it.  As a result of his 1-year showcase contract with the Lakers, Malik Monk manages to cash in a 4 year deal around $80M next summer."
You know Kyrie Irving is Weevil Underwood...
"Dray got himself suspended and he only missed 1 game. Iggy played the entire series and Bogut missing 2 games isnt exactly the same as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love missing the entire series lmao Cavs 2nd best player was Matthew Dellavedova, comparing that to Draymond missing a game cuz he wont stop kicking mfs in the nuts is fuckin shameless"
"They were on the border a super team, but not nearly on the same level as LeBron's Heat or once Durant joined the Warriors.  Outside of LeBron, the All-NBA selections were Love 2nd team in 2012 and 2014, and Kyrie 3rd team in 2015. In other words, they only had one consensus top 15 guy. LeBron was the only Cav to receive a single all-NBA vote in 2016 (although if Irving had missed fewer games he'd have gotten some at least)"
"I mean sure, but my point stands. Kobe wasn't the best player on his team for most of those championships, but people act like he was. Nobody treats, say, Kyrie Irving the same way."
Man I don't know how they'll survive having to lean on James Harden and Kyrie Irving more.
1. Stephen Curry  2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Trae Young 5. Chris Paul 6. Ja Morant 7. Jrue Holiday 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Ben Simmons 10. Russell Westbrook  That's their top 10
&gt;	injuries remain  &gt;	#2: Kyrie Irving
"[Kyrie Irving] ""Don't get the vaccine"" means   You stop taking something you're not supposed to and stop poisoning yourself. It’s the moment you discover the real you and can walk around with 5G in a society that shows a lot of the vaccines people get to track who they truly are.  *nothing COVID rule related!! Relax"
"Just as JaVale McGee would have all ten spots in the top ten for Shaqtin' a Fool, so to would Kyrie get all the spots in the top ten for [worst quotes](https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/craziest-kyrie-irving-quotes-6b2c42b573bb45eb)."
"&gt;One has happened significantly more often than the other.  You're right about this, but I think it proves a point you're trying to fight against. There's been a number of high profile players who have asked for trades (Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden), but it's hard to find any that just showed up and played hard for their team after doing that. Some were traded before it got to that point, and in the rest it became a mess.   About the only example I can think of when someone made a trade demand and still showed up and played hard and it wasn't a mess was when Kobe Bryant did it in 2007. But IMO that's an anomaly because he had a No Trade Clause, so it led to a stalemate between he and the Lakers, where he realized any trade package the Lakers would get for him would make his new team weak enough that he'd no longer want to go play there anymore. As a result he just stayed (and then the Lakers ended up being much better than he'd expected).   I think it's far more likely that this Simmons thing gets messier and the Sixers eventually give up and just trade him for whatever they can. If you're expecting Ben Simmons to show up and play great for you guys to rehab his value, I think you'll end up disappointed."
Insert Kyrie Irving quote
Anything Kyrie Irving has said.
Kyrie Irving just existing
Kyrie irving deserved that water bottle to the head at Boston. The guy is an asshole
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."

"That's a really good outcome for a #1 pick in an average draft.  You would be pleased if your #1 overall turned out to be a low level all-star player.  Take a look at the last 10 #1 overall picks, and Ben is clearly in the top range.  2010 - John Wall  2011 - Kyrie Irving  2012 - Anthony Davis  2013 - Anthony Bennett  2014 - Andrew Wiggins  2015 - KAT  2016 - Ben Simmons  2017 - Markelle Fultz  2018 - Deandre Ayton  2019 - Zion  Ben would be top 3 or 4 on that list, only Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving I would say are clear cut better than Ben Simmons, and both of those guys have serious injury concerns"

"Yes, because it’s very clear that players who demand trades lose respect in the NBA player circle.

"&gt;Irving was seen burning sage -- which is known as ""smudging'' -- on the court at TD Garden during warm-ups before his Nets beat the Boston Celtics 113-89 on Friday night in the NBA preseason finale for both teams.  &gt;""It just comes from a lot of native tribes,"" Irving said after the game. ""Being able to sage, just cleanse the energy, make sure that we're all balanced. When we come into this job, we come into this place, it's not anything that I don't do at home that I did today. I saged last game, and I plan to sage almost every game if the opposing team will allow me to.  &gt;""But, literally, it's more or less for us to stay connected and for us to feel great about going to work and feeling safe and provided for from our ancestors. I'm not going to bring too much of the spirituality into basketball, but yeah, it's part of my native culture where I'm from.""   &gt;Irving was inducted into the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe -- of which his mother, Elizabeth, was a member -- in the summer of 2018.

"I agree with PG being better than Kyrie. I would also argue that Booker and Mitchell are clearly better.   For starters, Booker and Mitchell are far more available than Kyrie is, and that matters. Irving has only had one healthy playoffs since 2017 (four seasons) and he was absolutely putrid the one time he was healthy. He is also prone to missing large portions of the regular season. Both Mitchell and Booker are far more durable during the regular season and thus their stats come on a higher volume of games played than Kyrie's.  Booker and Mitchell are also more accomplished in the playoffs as the focal points of their teams. Booker's one playoff trip resulted in him leading his team to the finals. Mitchell has had four runs as the guy in the playoffs and has made the second round twice and lost in the first round twice. Irving has had one run as the guy in the playoffs, during which he lost in the second round behind an absolutely horrendous series against Milwaukee. Booker definitely wins this category, and while Mitchell has also had bad series' in the playoffs, he has had far more good ones than Kyrie has, so Kyrie comes in third in this category.  From a statistical standpoint, they all have very similar statlines. Kyrie was the most efficient of the three by a decent margin, so we can give this category to Kyrie. Although, it is important to note that Kyrie's team had the worst record of the three and he spent a decent amount of his time playing as the second option compared to Booker and Mitchell spending all their time as the first option.  Based on all of this, I would pretty easily take either Booker or Mitchel as the superior players. I also think you could make an argument for Beal and Lavine, although that's a whole different can of worms."
Kyrie Irving
" ""And I'm not necessarily saying that was wrong to do I'm just saying LeBron is not going to Minnesota or Sacramento for a ""challenge"".""  &amp;#x200B;  Kyrie Irving or not, he wouldn't have went back to Cleveland if not for his Cleveland ties. He was trying to win a title for Cleveland. There were a lot of better places for him to go. The context of the time was that he proved he could win titles from his time at Miami. He very specifically chose to go back to Cleveland. He put himself in a position to win, but there were a several better places for him to go. The only big FA they ever got was Love, because he played for one of the only places worse than Cleveland. Every other ""big"" FA they got was washed."
"On the first point - gobert is the Dpoy and he gets embarrassed on the perimeter, I could bring up Terrence Mann this year, Steph currys 2 ankle breakers and he is not some kind of all time talent on the perimeter,   On the nets D.  Rondo isn’t on the Lakers I thought  That leaves a starting and closing lineup off  Bron, Davis, Westbrook, Nunn/Ellington/Ariza , and probably Melo/C/Another SG   Plus if rondo(if he is on  and Westbrook play they get killed on defence  Matchups Bron/Davis on durant Bron/Davis on harden WB/SG on Irving  Melo/C/SG on Harris C on Blake   Harden on Melo/SG/WB Blake on Davis Durant on Bron Irving on SG Harris on C/Melo    Overall my thoughts are that harden will be able to contain WB, and Bron/Davis will take 80% of the offence. I think the nets offence will kill any defence in the league. Passing it goes LBJ&gt;Harden&gt;&gt;&gt;KD/WB and I have question marks about the Lakers abilities (WB) to play iffball and esp after his time in Houston and his willingness to shoot esp with being a 32% shooter, Bron being a 35% shooter and Davis being a 25% shooter  Another comment is that the Lakers should focus on the west since IMO a healthy clippers/Nuggets team pose a chalkenge and if Bron/Day-to-Davis are out I don’t think that the old home can win a playoff series against a top team  Same as the nets with harden/Kyrie  Anyway gl man"
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"The ""point guard"" position seems kind of outdated imo. Are James Harden and Kyrie Irving both starting Point Guards? If Kyrie is the Shooting Guard, does that mean we're labeling that as ""his"" position? Will he go down as an all-time point guard or shooting guard? Is Giannis a PG? LeBron? They take on a lot of ""primary ball handler"" duties.  I personally break it down into either Guards / Wings / Bigs or Guard / Wings / Forwards / Bigs. The best players transcend positions- i.e. Lebron is a Guard/Wing.  Ben Simmons is the most interesting version of that because he's one of very few players in the league who ""jump"" one of those labels and is a Guard/Big imo, but that's because his skillset is so far removed from being effective on the perimeter, where Wings tend to operate.  Anyway, even among anyone fitting the ""Guard"" label, I don't have Ben top-10. He's maybe an average starting Guard in the league."
"boozer literally was disbanded by his agents for how dirty he did the cavs, they’ve spent more than anybody in history, and kyrie irving has already forced one trade from another team so i don’t think it’s a cleveland problem"
Kyrie Irving then?
"I mean, when school teachers have to re-teach their entire curriculums because Kyrie Irving publicly thinks the Earth is flat, yes, we should care."
"Hated team all the way. Not that the loved team is bad by any means, but the hated team has Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Paul George. I’m not sure they would ever miss a bucket, as basically the only two defenders on the loved team are Middleton and Giannis.  On top of that, you have Rudy Gobert and KD protecting the rim, and you have two really good defenders(so long as they are putting in the effort) in James Harden and Paul George, and a guy who doesn’t have the size to be effect, but is at least going to put in the effort in Kyrie.  Aside from that, switch out Middleton for Klay Thompson. I think this sub doesn’t give Middleton the credit he deserves, but this sub *loves* Klay Thompson.  Also, Westbrook and Lebron have to be on the hated team over Gobert and PG. I don’t think anyone truly hates either Gobert or George.  Even if you make those changes, I’m still taking the hated team."
I thought that Markell’s Fultz was a can’t miss prospect at point guard in the same vein of Kyrie Irving/pre-injury John Wall. Oof.

Kyrie Irving and his flat earth theory in shambles
People I didn't mention here but could have easily been mentioned:   2021: Ben Simmons  2020: Siakam or maybe even Westbrook again  2019: Kyrie Irving vs. Bucks(didn't put it over Westbrook because Bucks were still the 1 seed unlike Portland)  2018: Damian Lillard vs NOLA  2017: DeRozan again
"Trae Young did something last year that Russell Westbrook hasn't done since Kevin Durant left Oklahoma City in 2016, which is make a Conference Finals, he did that while averaging 29/3/9 on 55% TS.  &gt;  Harden is a SG, not a PG.  No he is not, he was listed as a PG last year and Kyrie Irving himself said that James was the point guard of the Nets, but who knows, maybe he just averaged 11 apg for fun.  &gt; Russ is a 9x all star and MVP  And that has zero value on how good of a player he is RIGHT NOW, he won an MVP in 2017, LeBron James played in Cleveland when that happened.  &gt; He is going to be completely in the MVP conversation this year, getting to play with Lebron and AD.  Damn, dude didn't even make an All-NBA team last year, but will be in the MVP convo this year just by changing uniforms, LA water is something else."
"&gt; Also James Harden is primarily a SG.  I guess Harden averaged 11 apg last year, was listed as a PG and was called the PG of the team by Kyrie Irving for fun.  Also, Trae Young and Luka Doncic aren't better than Russell Westbrook? The same Trae Young that led the Hawks to the ECF last year while averaging 29 and 9 and the same Luka that averaged 36 against Kawhi/PG?  Wow, what joining the Lakers does to people, Russ went from not even making All-NBA last year to being better than Luka freaking Doncic."
"Similarly, Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson were both drafted the same, although one of those picks was from a trade I believe"
Kyrie Irving and Tristen Thompson
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
He pretty much says it here:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2018/10/kyrie-irving-lebron-james-boston-celtics-cavs-trade-comments-move-career-nba-lakers/amp  And it’s true let’s be real. Anyone could see bron was done with Cleveland
"HARDDDD disagree  lebron, kd, giannis, kawhi, steph, james harden, jokic, embiid, ad, luka, dame time, paul george, chris paul, jimmy butler rudy gobert, tatum, booker, bam bam, kyrie irving, khris middleton are my personal top 20, with very loose ordering before anyone flames me.  can you really make a case that kat is actually better or has more actual realized impact for the team he plays for than any of those guys? I cannot, I really dont think hes underrated by a long shot. Hes properly rated"
"&gt;Bucks had a slightly better record vs the west than Mavs did.  Of course, they don't play the same teams.  If you compare the regular season schedule of the average western team to the average eastern team its laughable.    &gt;They were also a clearly better defensive team who could put Giannis, Jrue, Tucker on KD for multiple posessions with Kyrie and Harden playing injured... He was the focal point of the defense.  Irving played the first 4 games &amp; Harden was still demanding defensive attention when injured.  PJ Tucker &amp; Holiday are midgets, Kawhi has eaten these dudes alive in the past.    Who did KD have to guard?    &amp; the Clippers almost beating the Suns showed how good they were, they beat the #1 seed."
"Lebrons teammates in 2015 were kyrie Irving and a bunch of shooters lol. He was inefficient because he was hurt that year, and dealing with back injuries. They say he’s the best player cause he took the warriors to 6 without kyrie and love.   43% and 28% is unheard of for KD. That’s not just the warriors, it’s the entire run.  If you’re gonna talk about it being such a good run and that they were up 3-1 on the warriors, you gotta look at how good his supporting cast cause. You can’t have it both ways and say the supporting cast wasn’t good but also hype up kd for going up 3-1. That makes no sense.   Kd had a stacked team in 2016. Yes having more shooting would help, but that’s not why he lost. They lost cause him and Russ shit the bed."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"So much skill in such a small frame, still the pound-for-pound greatest. Curry kinda hampers that argument but ultimately he's like 25lbs heavier and deadlifts like a power forward. Iverson legitimately never found out his strength potential because he was afraid of mitigating his speed advantage.  The idea that a top 3 ballhandler (and probably the greatest until Kyrie Irving arrived) would be even *better* at a sport that didn't require that level of dexterity is mind boggling. Professional athletes are insane."
Kyrie Irving with a league average brain would be a perennial MVP candidate.
"I really have to disagree - and I guess it's more to do with the term ""champion level PG"" than your comment in particular. The starting PGs since 2010 of NBA Champions are:  * Jrue Holiday * Alex Caruso * Kyle Lowry * Steph Curry (x2) * Kyrie Irving * Tony Parker * Mario Chalmers (x2) * Derek Fisher * Jason Kidd   This list goes to show ""champion level PGs"" vary wildly. Also shows that if Ben Simmons had a jumpshot and replaced the PGs in the list, he would've been an NBA Champion more often than not."
Thybulle is an overrated gimmick defender  Tatum is a perennial all-star but won't ever be good enough to be the best player on a championship team - Paul George 2.0  The talent and overall product in the NBA has never been better  Jalen Green will force his way to the Lakers at some point during his second contract  Kyrie Irving is one of the best human beings in the NBA  Sixers' championship window closed as soon as they lost Butler
Kyrie Irving is not even a top 15 player in the NBA
"While I agree, as we have seen with Kyrie Irving, Paul George, and potentially a few others. Contract length does not matter anymore."
Every single game Kyrie Irving is listed on the card as a SG harden PG   Same with doncic   When Lakers didn’t have Westbrook lebron ran the point but was a SF on defense. Bruh your just wrong

Kyrie Irving - Klay Thompson - Kawhi Leonard - Kevin Durant - Kristaps Porzingis
"&gt; Have you ever played football?  yes, trained it regularly in local club as 10-16 years old and then I focused on basketball. Also in elementary school, best kids at basketball were also best kids at football. One kid start training basketball while few others (including me) started playing football and with time gap in skills was visible but football kids were still better basketball players than non-athletic kids.  &gt; juggle indefinitely for hours without dropping the ball, doing consistent 50 meter passes all falling within at most a few meters of the other players, controlling those same passes in a single touch with several different parts of their bodies, changing directions constantly while following attackers in a full on sprint  Kyrie Irving starting playing football as 8 years old and training it regularly for 10+ years would be able to do it too."
Kyrie Irving
"Your edit is kinda funny too. Disrespectful? Regular, proper, focused training is one of two most important thing and another one is natural ability to use your body in not clumsy fashion. If you will go to elementary schools to recruit future point guards and I will go to there  to recruit future centre backs, we will pick same kids because those sports. Then different training will shape them differently and Kyrie Irving would lack thousands hours of kicking and dribbling football and Kalidou Koulibaly would lack thousands hours of shooting and dribbling basketball"
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"[Marcus Smart](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments) talked about it a few months ago. I know you're being sarcastic, but unfortunately yes, Boston is racist as shit and the players know it. [Bill Russell](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2899150-bill-russell-fans-called-me-baboon-coon-n-word-during-celtics-games) knew it, too. [Boston racism in basketball](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/02/29/celtics-discuss-racial-dynamics-still-play-boston/) is honestly a pretty popular topic that seems to keep coming up all the time. Same as Utah.   Honestly your comment reeks of ""But I have a black friend"" energy. You're saying that Boston was nice to one black guy, so how could they be racist? I bet Tacko Fall and any other black player would be able to explain to you all about it."
I don't like using Kyrie is an example because his ball-handling skills and his movement are just flat unfair to use as a comparison for defensive skill because he's not anywhere near average. Easily one of the hardest possible positions for Defender to be put into is staying in front of Kyrie Irving consistently.
"I mean Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are Nets. How do you think I feel?"
We will also need Australian-born Kyrie Irving as an incentive to take back this distressed asset.
"Kyrie Irving, who prior to the 20-21 season indicated his plan to post-up more, has a PPP of 1.30 (4th in the league) though only on ~20 possessions for the season"
"Kyrie Irving - man, he’s crazy at times, but he plays beautiful basketball. You cannot watch his game and not appreciate the his mastery and skill at it.  And what he was doing this year, during the Muslim month of Ramadan, while fasting (no food no water from sunrise to sunset), was unbelievable. If I don’t eat or drink for a couple of hours, I get cranky and can’t focus. Guy was putting up MVP level numbers. Just insane. Just like Kyrie I guess."
"They would have swept everyone if they were healthy. Curry without kd : won a injured astersik finals, blew a 3-1 lead in finals got outplayed by Kyrie Irving, got carried 2 years in a row by KD and then 2019 dude couldn’t get the job done AGAIN without KD and then he missed the playoffs 2 years in a row without him. Dude has never accomplished shit without multiple hof teammates"
"I'm just not gonna like.. go through the list of superstars that were out these playoffs with injury (and who was eliminated as a result of that) and then be like ""oh yeah but Donte"" after looking at Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Trae Young, etc. Just a dishonest comparison. The reason the dude says ""a starter"" instead of Donte is because everyone knows where Donte is and saying ""a starter"" sounds more important."
"Kyrie Irving, he's a weird but good guy."
2022 Finals Potentially crushes all  PG Kyrie Irving  SG James Harden  SF LeBron James  PF Kevin Durant  C Anthony Davis  SF PF can go either way
"Kyrie? He is part of one of the most iconic finals OAT and played amazing + hitting the dagger in G7. Maybe not now, but in the end he will be remembered for that mostly.   Dirk obviously. KG not at all.  Same for Irving, nobody remembers him here for his chip, but for unique style and signature dunk.   Other best answer is Curry in my opinion. Multiple MVP. Best record of all time, but got carried to his rings. We would've remembered him by that behind the back pass out of bounds and getting blocked by LBJ."
Kyrie Irving for sure
"This is a weird thread.  There are a lot of good names in the discussion.  If you were to ask whose legacy was least affected by a ring, I'd certainly name Clyde and probably pick Kyrie.  Without a ring KD would still have decided to team up with Kyrie in Brooklyn.  With or without a ring, Clyde is usually forgotten because he's the shooting guard that played during the Jordan years who was extremely good but not as good as Jordan.  He was a dream teamer and held in far higher esteem by fans *before he got his ring* than he is today.  Dirk and KG are obvious top answers, but I really like Dr J.  Without a ring, I think Julius Irving is remembered more like Iceman Gervin or Bob Mcadoo. Nephews here just wouldn't know who he is.  With the ring, his is someone whose name will always be known by basketball fans because he is generally considered to have been the best of the 70s (Kareem was better but is also remembered for his play in the 80s).  Without the ring, that slot for ""70s great that even casual basketball fans would know"" would be filled by someone like Robert Parish or Bill Walton."

Kyrie Irving told Cavs he would get a selective surgery if they don’t trade him.            Teams don’t fine players for not showing up because it doesn’t do anything good.
Hard never on Horry Sikma Kyrie Irving
There is a belief in some corners of the league that Kyrie Irving would... (insert bizarre behavior/statement).
"I don't think Ayton should be that high, there was already a strong contingent of people who thought Luka should go 1st in 2018, and there were concerns about his motor in college.  In 2014 many people thought Embiid was the most talented prospect in the draft, and only slipped due to injuries. If Wiggins and Parker are on this list I feel like he should be around them somewhere.  Cade Cunningham is too high, there are already some people who believe Jalen Green or Evan Mobley have a higher ceiling (look at the GM survey) so he already has a fair amount of doubters entering his rookie year.  It's been a while but I think Kyrie Irving should be a bit higher. He was the consensus #1 pick all year."
"For a guy that loves and worships Kobe, Kyrie Irving does not love and worship basketball anywhere near the same level that Kobe did."
"&gt;healthy non-imbecile Irving 100% puts the 76ers as contenders, but real life Irving means Embiid's prime will be wasted.  Not when Brooklyn fixes their only weakness and loses scoring that they can very easily replace in exchange. Simmons is also less injury prone than Kyrie. This move would make the Nets the ONLY contender this year, because this Simmons is a better 3rd option behind two 3+ time scoring champs than even Klay was in Golden State."
"""ponder retirement"" is the type of word association you'd relate with Kyrie Irving tbh"
"Ah yes, Kyrie Irving...the most educated, well-minded, down-to-flat-earth person the NBA has ever seen.   Kyrie is a great basketball player, but if he is your poster boy for anything not resembling basketball, you probably should just give up while you are behind."
You're applying too much reason in simulating the thought process of Kyrie Irving lol
"I love the ""Deeply ponder"" like Kyrie Irving is some kind of deep thinker. When did this storyline of Kyrie being some kind of deep thinking smart genius who struggles with his feelings start? Kyrie is just another soft celebrity who has a ponytail on his heart and a lock on it because ""he can't get hurt like that again"". Kyrie wears rubber boots and splashes in puddles on a rainy day with his mouth wide open catching raindrops. No Einstein here just charmin soft. Just trade his goofy ass"

"Kyrie Irving will be looked on as one of the biggest fools In history, if he doesn't just get the shot and end this whole thing.   One of the most devastating events in history, and he chooses to be a champion for those fighting against life-saving medicine, because of what he read on Instagram  And going as far as losing millions to do it."
"It’s pretty funny that y’all learned actually nothing from the Harden situation. Talent is the most valuable thing you can have and teams will bend over backwards and ignore everything else about a player if they have it. Kyrie is going to get whatever he wants because he’s one of the most talented players ever. This is what will happen. Everything else in this “discussion” is smoke. Irving will either get the vax or play part time for the Nets this season, whichever he chooses, maybe take a fine or catch strays from Stephen A and Skip, and the Nets will still more than likely walk to a chip with no sleep lost by any of them.

Okay Kyrie.  &gt;“I do research on both sides,” Irving said at the time. “I’m not against anyone that thinks the Earth is round. I’m not against anyone that thinks it’s flat.

You're not getting peer reviewed studies searching that way.

Like if you look up the satanic plot bs then the first link is USA Today saying ""there's no luciferase"", an article from the Sun Sentinel which is paywalled but talks about how evangelicals are concerned about it being a satanic plot, then an article about *Kyrie Irving*, and then several other first page links are from conservative sites with people pushing the narrative like Tucker Carlson, a pastor, and a GOP rep from New Hampshire. So yeah, if they researched like a rational person then they'd find rational results, but **these people are not rational** and so they are getting back irrational results from their nonsense fucking searches."
Kyrie Irving. When you are that good you also need to be a leader. He is just not. Not sure if it is because he grew up along LeBron and could afford to follow his lead.   .
"Kyrie Irving   I love Kyrie’s game and this guy literally has an infinity gauntlet of moves he can bring out offensively in all facets of offence - scoring , dribbling , creating space , fakes , He can beat you from 3 , mid range , post and a bag full of layup finishes.   And well that’s the idea …….. But in reality for a player as skilled as him he doesn’t dominate the offensive scoring like Steph or Harden. What’s also surprising to me is for a player with such a deep bag of tricks he’s never won a scoring title.   Last season he had a masterclass of an offensive season which is the ideal for the most part.   But then there’s also injuries and the drama lol.    The idea behind Kyrie might just be a basketball ninja equipped for any situation on offence with multiple weapons but the reality is a shaved off version of that filled with on court and off court issues."

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

"Overrated:  Simmons. He's the best point of attack wing defender in the league in my opinion but unlike a lot of guards who play that role he's easy to screen out of the play. Even at his size he hardly provides any rim protection and he isn't a particularly smart defender either so he can't play free safety like Draymond which is a role that has a larger footprint than a run-of-the-mill perimeter defender. He shouldn't have sniffed 2nd in DPOY voting.  KD. People keep calling him borderline elite for whatever reason when he's never even made an all-defensive team in his life. He was straight up known as an average to below average defender until his last year with the thunder, had a couple good years in 2016 and 2017, and didn't really get back to that in the following years. He's a good isolation wing defender but there is so much more to playing defense than that. Like Simmons he's easy to screen out of the play but unlike Simmons he isn't very good at staying in front of quicker players. He's a good weakside shot blocker but he's often late on help. All in all he grades out as above average, not elite.  Underrated:  LeBron. He's not the only player in the league who takes plays off once in a while or accepts he got beat and concedes an open shot, yet he's the only one cherry picked to death and every time his defense is mentioned it comes with the qualifier ""when he's fully locked in."" He's played legitimately good to elite defense every year of his prime since '09. At least, outside of 2018 when he had one of the largest offensive burdens a player has ever had in their 30s. He's been snubbed for all defense 2nd team at least twice now and if he stayed healthy this year, probably would've been a third. These last two years he's been elite even in the regular season.   Yes, he has another gear reserved where he ""locks in"" for the playoffs but the difference isn't him going from a lazy, average defender to a good one, it's him going from a great defender to arguably the best non-big defender in the league. In 2020 he was the best perimeter defender in the playoffs and he's #1 all time in postseason DRAPM, ahead of Kawhi and Tony Allen, and any other defensive specialist you can think of. As far as perimeter defenders go the only guy who has the peak and longevity to match him at this point is Scottie Pippen.  Curry: I keep seeing people call him a liability. Getting targeted and scored on by LeBron James, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving doesn't make you a liability. He was being targeted because he's been flanked by some of the best defenders in the league at their positions, so logically if you're going head hunting he's the best option available. He's an average man defender and above average team defender making him a neutral defender at worst."
Kyrie Irving? Straight to jail
"Yep, just trade the guy already...  **10 NBA Superstars Who Forced A Trade**   NBA players switch teams all the time, whether through free agency or a trade. Sometimes a player is traded because another team wants them to improve their roster, or because of salary cap constraints. But other times, players get traded because they request the trade themselves, and then end up at a destination that they prefer.    NBA superstars’ trade requests carry a lot of weight. These players are the face of the franchise, and are usually the highest paid players on a roster. If they request a trade, then their franchise usually trades them to avoid dealing with a disgruntled superstar, and in hopes gaining value for the future in return, such as high draft picks. If the franchise holds out, then the player forces a trade using the leverage that they have. Here are 10 superstars throughout NBA history that have forced trades to other franchises:      1. Anthony Davis   2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Wilt Chamberlain   5. Chris Paul   6. James Harden   7. Kyrie Irving   8. Vince Carter   9. Carmelo Anthony   10. Paul George"

I've seen people get 1000s of upvotes calling CP3 a whiny bitch or much worse because he flops during basketball games. Now I say that he's irresponsibly promoting a conception of society that places the individual over the self, and suddenly I'm being too harsh? Obviously, you are not responsible for this phenomenon, but it's strange that calling people every horrible thing under the sun for playing basketball dishonorably is a-ok but expressing mild disappointment for endorsing public health risks is somehow verboten. This is as high-stakes as it gets. Lives are LITERALLY on the line. I'm not saying that Kyrie Irving is the voice of a generation, but it's a team effort. Every voice towards getting vaccinated matters, and everyone making excuses for those that aren't matter too.

"Colin was definitely. Definitely. Blackballed. However, I think the reason they were okay with blackballing him was because… he was pretty much exposed at that point. He was an nfl caliber starter and certainly a really good player to have as  a backup but he was never going to lead a team to a super bowl.   If kyrie Irving was like, only averaging 14 a game he would have probably been black balled years ago. But owners want championships. Because that’s more money. So they will grin and bare it.

The Bucks escaped that series by the skin of their asses even with the comical injury luck Brooklyn suffered. They had 3 games of Kyrie Irving and two games of James Harden at like 25% capacity. Give me a fucking break.
All Kyrie Irving did was refuse to get a vaccine and simply continue to do what he was doing. And yet some people act like he is the antichrist for desiring body autonomy.
it will depend on if part time nba player Kyrie Irving decides to become a full time nba player
"Steph after flirting with the idea that the moon landing was faked on a podcast: immediately retracts and clarifies, and when the pandemic happens uses his platform to disseminate credible info by reaching out to Faucci and posting their converstation on YouTube, goes public about getting vaxxed and now making these comments, continues to be a legend  Kyrie Irving after the world is flat comments: doubles down, ruins the Boston Celtics, multiple word salad interviews, more conspiracy theories, court incence purifications, claims was KD in another life, more conspiracy theories, abandons team, publicly questions teamates and tries to get them traded, breaks covid lockdowns to go to parties, calls people who call him out on his bullshit pawns, more consipracy theories, continues being an attention prostitute with mask comments that supposedly were not about covid but obviously were about covid, is about to ruin another franchise because he's antivax, keeps being the fool on the hill who really thinks is smarter than everyone while the whole world laughs at him  Conclusion: be more like Steph"
"Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, and Kyrie Irving if by least popular you mean the most hated."
Friendly reminder that you don’t know and have never spoken to Kyrie Irving.
"What did the agents for Juwan Howard, Glenn Robinson, Vince Carter, James Harden, Carlos Boozer, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving and whoever else advise their clients to do?   Kyrie literally threatened to have surgery if the team didn’t trade him and he sure as shit wasn’t signed by Klutch. Juwan Howard &amp; Glenn Robinson were rookies who even refused to play for the teams that drafted them and Klutch didn’t even exist.   What you are attributing to the agent you should be attributing to the player. The formula has always been make shit as uncomfortable and contentious as possible so the team trades you. Ben Simmons &amp; Daryl Morey are essentially playing a game of chicken.   An agent with a fiduciary duty to act in the client’s best interest is not going to advise their client to give up money, especially given the fact that the money cannot be recouped.   It is Ben Simmons decision to not report and y’all continually suggesting that Rich Paul would advise his client to give up money means you fundamentally don’t understand agent representation or the laws that govern agency agreements.   Again, y’all’s Rich Paul’s hate boner is fucking weird."
"If Dame or Beal requests a trade, why are they so sure it'll be the Sixers lol? A dysfunctional franchise with a stubborn gm, an asshole coach and a trade asset that's only less unpredictable than Kyrie Irving- If I'm Dame, I'd rather join Jokic in Denver while if I'm Olshey, I'd rather take Murray in injury recovery over doing business with the Sixers."
"Has Kyrie Irving already taken previous vaccinations, like smallpox, etc?  If yes, why hold out on the COVID one? Hypocritical much?"
"Kyrie Irving part-time basketball player.  Full-time idiot.  And I'm pretty sure Elgin Baylor was already a part-time basketball player at one point.  &gt;Baylor, a United States Army Reservist, was called to active duty during the 1961–62 season, and being stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, he could play for the Lakers only when on a weekend pass.[18] Despite playing only 48 games during the 1961–62 season, he still managed to score over 1,800 points.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Baylor"
"Kevin Durant must be fuming. The guy just wants to play basketball and win more titles, then this woke snowflake comes along and starts acting out like some 21 year old Instagram girl.  Too bad the players have so much power in today's NBA. Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, who's next to stir shit while having immunity from being punished?  Well, Ben is getting punished, but it really seems like a slap on the wrist in the grand scheme of things.   Way too often players talk about their rights when they should instead be talking about your responsibilities. How about your responsibilities to your team mates, Mr. ""Vaccine is a racist plot"""

&gt;	Press Release: Kyrie Irving is donating his in game salaries to  The Brooklyn Vaccination Awareness Foundation
Nets will find some PR savvy way of doing it.   Press Release: Kyrie Irving is donating his in game salaries to an undisclosed charity
"Kyrie Irving legitimately believes that the vaccine is part of an elaborate plot by the ""elites"" to manipulate black people by way of a supercomputer powered by Satan.  Not one word of that absolutely insane sentence is a lie. Check Rolling Stone's recent article on Kyrie's hijinks. This dude is absolutely out of his motherfucking mind."
It’s unfortunate for humanity that Kyrie Irving is so good at basketball.
"As good as we would be if KD and kyrie came to the Knicks instead, I’m so glad that isn’t the case at this point. Irving is super hard to root for fuck that guy"
"With the amount of drama Kyrie Irving brings the list of players I would rather have on my team than him runs a hell of a lot deeper than that.  I wouldn't trade him straight-up for Jordan Poole, and I'd be iffy on Mychal Mulder, and Mulder's usually only good in garbage time. Genuinely I think Kyrie might be a net negative, just for the sheer scale of drama and distraction."
"This dude is one of the most dramatic players in recent memories, every year there's some non-basketball story related to him.  Kyrie ""I'm more than just a basketball player"" Irving"
Kyrie Irving has entered the building.

how would you solve a kyrie irving and ben simmons situation?
"Allen Iverson - an all time great but he's waaaay overhyped  Kyrie Irving - his fans talk about him like a top ten guard ever, he's really really not  Andrew Wiggins - was supposed to be the next Lebron, instead became Wigs   Ben Simmons - lol  Jahlil Okafor - LOL"
"A regular season record. Jazz were the #1 seed and so were the 76'ers. Look what happened. People ignore the season performances until they need it for an argument lol. Not to mention, the injuries GSW had, and the ejection on Draymond helped them turn the tables. Also, just proving my point he had Kyrie Irving the #1 pick and Kevin Love on his team. Kyrie averaged 27 points, helped lock down Steph at points, scored 41 points in an elimination game 5, and made the game winning shot."
Can't wait till we see the trade of: Ben Simmons for Kyrie Irving
"It's not the Bucks though. Some time after we learnt how Kyrie was damaging that team. Just after that series all pf us thought that it was indeed a great Bucks win. It was only *after* that post season that we had to take that back when more and more became known of It's deleterious effects on that team.  Again, I invite you to read threads just after the series ended. Nobody thought that the Bucks got it easy, in fact everyone thought that the Bucks' dominant performance ensured that they will prolly steamroll over the Raps. So much so that we thought it was disappointing that they eventually lost **despite actually being similar teams**.   Bucks' convincing win over the Celtics overpowered them in the eyes of people during that post season. So don't give me how the Bucks destroyed those C's reputation. It's simply untrue, again, go back and read the threads after. Nobody was calling those C's trash at the time *or* after.   It's only after the whole KY drama , months later, that we learnt the whole extend of the issue. Ever since KY is avoiding the Celts and in the one series they actually beat them he *actually* went on at the center of the court and stepped on lucky w malicious ""intent"", pretty much giving credence what was widely reported: Irving hates the city of Boston and more specifically the Celtics and willingly sabotaged them so that to get the trade to the team he actually loved (at the time, I don't think he does anymore).  All of them are public record. You can't just ignore them and pretend that the Bucks had anything to do with it.cThe Celts drama preexisted *and* outlived that series. That series merely showcased the cancerous growth that the Cs had to contend with already.  I'm sure that we find similar things about these Nets eventually. As in they may well underperform and it will be shown that they were trash all along because Irving poisoned their waters (metaphorically speaking, I don't expect him to be as crazy a to do it literally). I am sorry, that is the kind of dude he is, it's a miracle that Lebron won anything w that guy. Don't go on telling me that the Bucks did anything to the preexisted Celts' malignancy called Kyrie Irving."
"Oh right I forgot he played with another #1 draft pick on his team twice. Oh wait, no that was Lebron. Pippen needed time to develop when he was drafted and Rodman was already a problem athlete by the Spurs by the time he joined the Bulls. Tell me how they compare to #1 pick Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis in their primes, Dwade and Bosh in their primes?"
"IF Simmons is really going to exaggerate/fake injuries to avoid playing and still get paid, it will put the Sixers and NBA in a very difficult position.  Identifying and diagnosing injuries/pain, (let alone mental illness) isnt an exact science.  Kawhi and the Spurs disagreement about the condition of his quad injury is a recent and famous example.  The Spur's doctors cleared him medically but Kawhi and his doctors disagreed, which caused him to miss most of the 2nd half of the season.  The following season Kawhi demanded a trade and the same quad injury would periodically limited him in stints with the Raptors and Clippers.  Kyrie Irving is another reported example.  In his demand to be traded from the Cavs, he threatened to have knee surgery prior to the season if his demand were not accommodated.  The Cavs traded him soon after.  If Simmons' complains of back pain or other such injuries that are hard to verify or is subject to different diagnosis from different doctors, the Sixers and the league are left with very little remedy in terms of getting him to perform OR withholding salary.  This doesn't even touch on the even murkier area of mental health which is even harder than physical injuries to verify and diagnose.  And before someone say, this issue must be fixed in the next CBA.  There really isn't any clause or provision that they could add to fix this, due to the nature of guaranteed contracts and the difficulties of diagnosing injuries/pain."
"The same Pippen who was garbage/average the first 4 or so years before they won their 1st chip? Unlike AD, D Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, and in some regards Kevin Love?"
Kyrie Irving never plays games in cleveland or Boston anymore so he doesnt get booed.
"In 2018, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, DeMarcus Cousins, Kawhi Leonard all became injured by playoff time. Just give up already. The Bucks won the title fair and square. Injuries are part of the game every single season. I'll continue to prove you wrong and you will continue to make a fool of yourself if you want to keep commenting and keep carrying on this salty conversation."
"If you were the commissioner, how would you handle the Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving issues going on right now."
So what's your thoughts on Kyrie Irving?
Enter Kyrie Irving
"Toronto when Durant went down in the finals. Bill Walton, Portland Trail Blazers, 1978 NBA Playoffs. Kyrie Irving/Kevin Love, 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers. Bill Russell, Boston Celtics, 1958. Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks, 2003 NBA Playoffs. Derrick Rose, 2012 Chicago Bulls.   Injuries happen. Bucks were still a top team in the league and have arguably been the best team in the league, record wise, the last 3 years. Cry more."
Top 20 all time what? That's such an insult to anybody who played basketball before Kyrie Irving.
He is a more versatile scorer and I agree a better scorer overall but the gap isnt as big you’re making it out to be. You wouldn’t say that Kyrie Irving was a better scorer than shaquille o’neal simply because Kyrie can get you a bucket whenever he wants.
"&gt; He’s been a very good player but I feel like there‘s still so much potential wasted by his weird personality  100%.  MVP talent but All-Star production.   It's actually crazy when you look at how much better he can be from pretty much every point on the floor without being better overall.   From 2018-19:  Shot Type | Dame| Kyrie| Difference ---|---|----| --- 0-3ft| 56.4| 63.3| 6.9 3-10ft | 35.7 | 44.4| 8.7 10-16ft | 42.9| 52.4|9.5 16ft-3P | 47.3 | 47.6|0.3 3P | 36.9 | 40.1| 3.2 **TS%** | **58.8** | **59.2**|**0.4**   He has the better handles and ability to get to whatever shot he wants. He also shoots better from just about every point on the floor.  But there's a marginal difference in terms of the individual scoring efficiency because Dame's taking better quality shots and more willing to get to the line.   Kyrie is better in any given situation. Dame puts himself in better situations.   And that's before talking about the run-off effect their scoring has on the rest of the team's offence.   From Jackie MacMullan:  &gt; During a rare practice in the middle of last season, coach Tyronn Lue, who was standing next to assistant coach and Irving confidant Phil Handy, called out to his young point guard. &gt;  &gt; “Ky,” Lue said, “I want you to play a little faster.” &gt;  &gt; “Why?” Irving asked. &gt;  &gt; “Because if we play faster, we get shots off easier.” &gt;  &gt; “I don’t need to play faster to get my shot off,” Irving replied. “I can do that anytime.” &gt;  &gt; “I’m not talking about your shot. I’m talking about RJ and JR,” Lue said, citing teammates Richard Jefferson and Smith. &gt;  &gt; “Well, that’s No. 23’s job,” Irving replied, referring to James. &gt;  &gt; According to members of the Cavs organization who witnessed the exchange, Lue ended the conversation by walking away, shaking his head. &gt;  &gt; Both Lue and Handy, whom Irving affectionately calls his “OG,” confirmed the incident but declined to elaborate. “Kyrie is a great player,” Lue says. “Please tell him I wish him the best.”"
"If Iggy thinks Kyrie Irving is a top 20 player of all time then I can definitively say, yes, I know more about basketball than Andre Igoudala."
"Aight then Dre, take someone off then. Say ""Kyrie Irving is better than Player X"""
"The lakers were lucky they played a Suns team where Chris Paul got hurt. If we’re lucky Murray got a season ending injury, are we also lucky Klay Thompson got a season ending injury? Were the bucks lucky Kyrie Irving and James Harden got injured? These are excuses"
"I would say there are 20 PGs in history *greater* than Kyrie Irving, but not 20 PGs who are *better*."
Very Kyrie Irving of him
"We’re gonna be doing this every time these Lakers lose, I’m afraid. Enough to make a guy wish for more Kyrie Irving drama."
Just in the wrong sub. r/freefolk would eat it up. If I wanted upvotes I would’ve made the comment about kyrie Irving
At scoring? Yeah.  Defense? Not even close.   Rebounding? Not even close.  Passing? Not even close.   Leadership? Not even close.  Only way you can think Kyrie Irving was better than Jason Kidd is if you didn’t watch him in New Jersey and read box scores in hindsight
Kyrie Irving is better than Jason Kidd.

it’s cuz everyone sees someone being wrong. no one ever sees the same person later admit they’re wrong and apologize for it.   case in point: kyrie irving has admitted multiple times that he was wrong about earth being flat. it’s still pretty universally accepted that kyrie is a flat earther.

""But when you get to the playoffs, the main thing is the main thing, and we’re brothers, and we’re pulling together to get this thing done.""   His stats for the first 9 games of the playoffs, when he was ignoring teammates, was pretty bad. 22 points on 40% shooting and 27% from 3. He was good after that tho, idk what changed"
"Yeah, autodraft espessialy loves Kyrie and Westbrook this season. I have Irving on one of my teams, and I still haven't decided what to do with him. I might actually drop him later tonight if someone from waiver wire plays really well, because I don't feel like Kyrie will budge anytime soon."
"Philly has had enough drama and instability recently. The absolute LAST thing we need is Kyrie ""Woke"" Irving on the team."
Brooklyn is missing kyrie Irving. Huge difference
"I totally disagree with this take.  Kyrie was amazing in 2016 especially the playoffs.  Kyrie had 27 ppg on 46.8% shooting, 40% from 3.  It gets lost with time but the Warriors did not have an answer for Kyrie Irving in the finals - it is not an accident he took the game winning shot."
" Bro what?! You a casual? You don’t remember kyrie wanting out and it being a big ass story of them trading him to Cavs for kyrie???

They said it was in one place. It was not in that place. It ended up being in his hip. Therefore, when they traded him, he was already quote unquote damaged goods to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Remember, the trade was rescinded. The Cavs had to accept Isaiah Thomas injured. Once he went to the Cavs he was already hurt, he only played a handful of games there. The training staff of the Boston Celtics got let go because of it. Now, Isaiah Thomas, two teams later, is a substitute going into free agency injured. After now finally getting surgery. That cost him $100 million. No question about it.  -Jalen Rose"
"Any respectful coach would bench this guy until he is, at least, 255 lbs. I just hate how players have all the power in this league, while not fulfilling out their contracts. This guy, along with Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving, are just 3 examples of how wrong things are in the NBA. You’re playing a game, getting paid millions to do it, have a whole city and organisation behind you, and you decide to throw it all away because “it’s not the city I want to play in.” Fuck that, these contracts need to be enforced otherwise you’re getting multiple Kyrie situations over the next decade."
"i guarantee Kyrie Irving has no idea what ""status quo"" even means."
Kyrie Irving is an NBA champion. Fuck the narrative.  Is he an antivaxer? That's also true.
LeDad giving Russ the Kyrie Irving treatment
Jaden Smith said all that crazy shit when he was like 13 or 14.  Which isn't really that ridiculous for a kid.  The funny part is that almost-30 year old Kyrie Irving talks like 14 yr old Jaden Smith.
Kyrie Irving and Muhammad Ali don’t belong in any sentence that isn’t “these two men were black athletes.”
The Nets don't care about the regular season and will probably punt in situations where a comeback is unlikely so they can get KD/Harden extra rest. Especially as long as Kyrie Irving is out.
"Kyrie is a flat earther. Refuses to get vaccinated despite having a new born at home. Your'e also disregarding the fact that Kyrie got into Duke because of his basketball skills and not his academics.  If they let Kyrie play and him or one of his loved ones gets seriously sick or dies.. and the infection is traced back from an NBA game? The Nets are protecting Kyrie and themselves from Kyrie's idiocy.  Kyrie is an idiot. This is known. And all of this chatter on social media.. it does matter; simply because people look up to Kyrie because of his basketball skills. Not too long ago I read about how this primary science teacher got sad and vented on reddit, because one of his students insisted that the earth is flat.. when asked.. the child said because ""Kyrie said so"". It won't be surprising if a lot of the kids or teenagers after seeing Kyries stance.. won't get vaccinated because of Kyrie. This will also embolden anti vaxxers.  Sure, Kyrie says he believes in the science of the vaccine and whatever on his IG. But thats bullshit; people have been losing their jobs due to the vaccine mandate just recently. The vaccines have been available about 7 months ago - especially accessible to multi millionaires. Kyrie is simply an anti vax person. If you believe in the science; you'd have gone for the vaccine as soon as possible. This guy is a liar.  But okay. Sure, he has the right to his stance. But no one should apologize for him if he loses out on an nba job. And personally, I hope he never gets another contract from another team. Also, let's keep one thing clear. No one is strapping down kyrie to a chair and forcing the vaccine on him. There are hwowever consequences - and as mentioned before. These consequences are to protect Kyrie and the league.  Covid is no joke. Vaccines significantly reduce the spread of the virus. And if you do get infected as a vaccinated person - you will likely not get the severe symptoms and also most likely live. Also, if you get vaccinated - you are less likely to spread the virus. All science and backed by data. The sooner everyone gets vaccinated, the better. All these variants? They form because they mutate. Mutation of viruses directly correlates to how much it spreads. Ie if everyone gets vaccinated - then the sooner we all get back to what life was like pre covid.  This is why Kyrie Irving is being shamed publicly. And rightly so. We all want out of this pandemic asap."

"Yeah, the Simmons and Irving scenarios are pretty different. The Sixers can continue to not pay him if he doesn’t commit to playing. The Nets are opting to not playing Kyrie on the road, which means they have to pay him for those games.   I think the Simmons situation demonstrates the CBA is working in the teams favor. The Irving situation seems too much like an edge case to truly impact negotiations, but I suppose vaccinations could be a part of the next CBA talks."

Did you type up the same speech when non-Native American Kyrie Irving tossed sage all over a basketball court awhile back?
*Kyrie Irving states he is demanding a trade from the Brooklyn Nets after finding out Barclays Center violated sacred Native American land during construction*
"I don’t know when the Law has ever made that much sense or been fair. So I really don’t get the caping for Kyrie Irving. First they don’t trust the science, now all of a sudden they don’t trust the laws and rarely talk about that science they know. Why should he be appeased if the rest of us won’t be?"

This sub is easily as bad when it comes to glamorizing drama as any other media outlet, if not way worse. We thrive off of it apparently"
This is pretty racist since sage is a Native American tradition. It’s like saying  “Kyrie Irving dropped the fried chicken” or some other racist stereotype.
Ben Simmons for Kyrie Irving. does Philly feel about that?
"Sources: Steve Nash asked Kyrie Irving to get a vaccine today. Irving refused. Nash asked again. Irving said no again. Nash then told Irving he should go home, and Irving dropped the sage and left."

"I think the challenge is that the drama stuff is way more universal and easier to talk about than game content. As a Thunder fan, I want to read and discuss game content about Thunder games and players but haven't watched enough of Talen Horton-Tucker to be able to discuss his play. As a Lakers fan, you probably want to read and discuss game content about the Lakers but probably don't have much to say about Darius Bazely.  However, when Kyrie Irving says the earth is flat, that's an easy discussion point to all of us because everyone on this forum knows who Kyrie is and is generally familiar with accepted cosmology. There's no barrier to entry to discussion.  We'd all love to *read* other people's analysis of how the Kings' defensive schemes don't properly utilize the talents of Tyrese Haliburton or whatever, but this content takes a significant amount of effort (research, film study, analytics code/spreadsheets, visualizations, etc) to *produce*. Any OC on this forum with the slightest modicum of effort and insight is instantly upvoted to the top, but you can't upvote what isn't there. I tried to write up a film study thing for /r/cfb earlier this season, but my god it takes *so. much. time* to produce something worthwhile.  Commenting ""lmao I bet Jimmy Butler and Rachel Nichols hooked up"" or ""lmao MPJ finally found a shot he won't take"" takes 3 seconds."
"the funniest thing to me about this whole ""debate"" is how the pro vax side can only argue via analogy ""you wouldnt let someone burn down his house"" ya thats not what he did though. No one from what i've seen has come up with an actual meaningful analogy. It is a matter of fact that kyrie irving has not harmed anyone, this is not debatable."
"He's just a really cool player man, no one has ever claimed he is as good as ""kyrie irving, chris paul, or even derrick rose.""    Also you have zero obligation to be a fan of his.  If you aren't, then you aren't.  I think he has some of the sickest highlights in the NBA and seems like a cool dude, and obviously he plays for my fav team (and is my favorite player) so I'm a massive fan.  I've also always been a sucker for players with a high ""highlight-to-production"" ratio.  Dudes like JR Smith who might not score 30 every night but still is obviously an insanely talented player with insane highlights and capable of popping off any night.  Difference between JR and Jamal is that both are that, but Jamal clearly has a bit more of a ""killer instinct,"" leadership and focus on the game.   But if you watch his highlights and his bubble performance and that's not enough to make you a fan, then it's fine just not being a fan.  This is an odd post"
"Kyrie Irving, you can't pay a player that much money for someone who doesn't really have a the right mentality to play. An activist 1st, an Nba player as 2nd.  I'm not gonna really want to debate about his ideals that much cause he might be a good person at heart tbh, but it's pretty clear that the Nets got the short end of the stick with that one."
"I mean i will vote for him. And i never liked kyrie whatsoever. But the meme and the fact of the joke that the nba is basketball second and entertainment first makes this a logical choice.  Gonna be something like Ben Simmons, Kurie Irving, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan (if hes coonted as a big) and Embiid."
Does this story end with Kyrie Irving getting locked in a cage with Justin Gaethje?   Because I’m very here for that lmao
Come to Clevland. Make the all-star game and go home. Thank you Kyrie Irving.
"If Ben is truly a better player than Finals winner, Gold medalist, and all time great skill player Kyrie Irving (which I don't think can be true about Simmons who attempted 4 4th quarter shots across 7 games in the semifinals, but I guess you're allowed to think so), then why is the player who would help them win more in the short term the better rebuilding player?"
&gt; what Ben Simmons is doing  What Ben Simmons *and* Kyrie Irving are doing...people seem to forget Kyrie in all of this

Kyrie Irving
"The West is pretty open right now. If Klay is at least 85% of his former self by the time the playoffs role around, I give them a good shot to make it to the Finals.  As for winning it, the answer lies with Kyrie Irving lol."
"Idk, Kyrie Irving has nothing on Q-Aaron."
"ok man. i'm not picking apart anything, that's literally what you're doing. i'm taking him at face value.  you just tried to say that a man who said ""It’s up to the NBA and Kyrie Irving to work something out."" didn't say ""its up to them to work it out"". your words. i didn't look at your flair at first but i guess this is an insecure knicks fan thing or something, sorry to have stepped on your toes there."
Bruh are you stupid? What part of Kyrie Irving isn’t playing don’t you get?
"Kyrie is on the roster and played for them.last year. They built a superteam with durant  Irving, harden, griffen, mills, Aldridge and Harris."
I cannot fucking believe that we are now living in a world where Aaron Rodgers is a bigger COVID nut job than Kyrie Irving. Unreal.

"Kyrie ""Aaron Rodgers"" Irving"
"Karl Malone, Delonte West, Meyers Leonard, Kyrie Irving"
Nets going to be the one seed behind a rested Kyrie Irving going insane (in a good way) at the end of the season.
-Lakers are too old and do not make the playoffs.    -Kyrie Irving is the Aaron Rodgers of the NBA. Overrated.   -Tatum is being wasted in Boston.    -Cameron Thomas will be rookie of the year.
"What makes Al genuinely special offensively is his screen setting. Not only does he set good screens but everything else he does kind of comes from screens as well.     Ideally, he should have the ball in his hands and he should be setting a screen for someone. His skill set and decision-making in those situations is so elite.   * His best passes are off screens  * His best drives are off screens  * His best jump shots are off screens  * His best off-ball spacing comes from how his screens      During his first Boston stint he had guys like Isaiah Thomas and Kyrie Irving who he could set screens for and then make plays out of those screens.   * Sometimes he screens and rolls to the rim * Sometimes he screens and pretends to roll to the rim but then seals a defender to open up a driving lane * Sometimes he screens but instead of rolling he pops out at the FT or 3P line * Sometimes he slips the screen and spaces out to the perimeter to pull the big man out of the paint * Sometimes he fakes the handoff and drives to the rim * Sometimes he fakes the handoff and swings the ball around to someone else * Sometimes he fakes the handoff and then throws an entry pass to the now cutting guard who he just faked the handoff with * etc etc.  The possibilities are endless and it makes him so effective because you never know what he's going to do and he reads and reacts so well that he can kind of make it up as he goes.   Then he goes to Philadelphia where neither Ben or Joel use screens and Brett Brown's system didn't really use them either. Harris is a nice PnR scorer but it took the 76ers a while (and a coaching change) to figure that out.  You're right, Al is super plug-and-playable, but he ended up on the one team in the league that didn't really value his screen setting.   They tried to play him off-ball and that's kind of missing the point.  Signing Al Horford to a big contract and then not having him set screens is like signing JJ Redick and not having him shoot 3s."
"Draymond ""Kyrie Irving"" Green"
"&gt; I hope at least some people already noticed when he, you know, won a championship.  a lot of folks did. If he can have the same success (which I think he will), it will really solidify that he's been the best PG in the East since about ~2014 (yes, over Kyrie Irving).    Only now, with Harden taking the PG duties (if he does), would I say he isn't."
Kyrie “Kyrie” Kyrie Irving
Does this include or exclude Kyrie irving? Cuz teams could surely beat the Irving-less Nets
Nets hole- kyrie Irving
"&gt;Kyrie and KD can take turns as head coach some days  ""I don’t really see us having a head coach. You know what I mean? KD could be a head coach. I could be a head coach.”-Kyrie Irving"
"What are you even talking about? Any trade that lands you 3 stars in Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Kyrie Irving is obviously a win, regardless of how it turned out with kyrie"
I’ll give you one Kyrie Irving who’s unvaccinated
"I don't want Simmons anywhere near this team and haven't almost since the moment trade rumors started cropping up lol. I admit I briefly entertained the idea that he'd be a decent (not great, but decent) fit, but even then *only* if we kept Buddy, Hali, and Barnes (our best 3P shooters).  As soon as the toxic antics started I was over the idea. I hate that kinda shit and I honestly don't care how good the player is, I wouldn't want any piece of it. Same shit with people taking about Kyrie Irving trade rumors. Nah."
Kyrie Andrew Irving
Kyrie Irving
I think he will average more points than Kyrie Irving this year.
He’s probably just chilling with Kyrie Irving.
"I believe Silver [wanted a mandate](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32425851/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-wanted-vaccine-mandate-says-kyrie-irving-status-issue-new-york-city), but the Player's Association wouldn't agree to it. Having notorious-weirdo Kyrie be [one of your VPs](https://nbpa.com/leadership) seems like a recipe for trouble."
Hows Kyrie Irving?
"So how did the Nets, Celtics, Cavaliers fare with Kyrie Irving?"
KAI is also his initials. Kyrie Andrew Irving
"For some reason people call Kyrie Irving “Kai” instead of “Ky”, idk if it came from him or elsewhere"
"Not often, honestly.  Jimmy Butler and Giannis however are examples of people who kept getting responsibilities increased as their effort increased until eventually the entire team revolved around them.  Jimmy was literally just a hustle guy role player until his 4th year, but he kept locking people up, kept doing what Thibs asked, kept improving, always played for the team.  A lot of times, people come into the league thinking they're leaders because they're lottery, everyone sucks their dick and has insanely high optimism for them, no one actually listens to them so much as roots for them to do shit.  They start basically thinking like Kyrie Irving, like ""oh, even though there's 10 people here, it's really just me winning or losing the game.""  That's how leadership dies.  No one believes in those people enough to change what they're doing because they don't sacrifice themselves.  With Kobe, you saw how bad he wanted it, and how much he sacrificed personally to get a ring in exchange for not having any fun, and some people hate that leadership, but the people who rolled with Kobe voluntarily rolled hard and believed.   It all comes when you start grinding away in playoffs, in my experience, that you end up with the kind of leadership you're talking about.  The people on your team see you for who you really are and how bad you really want it.  I don't think Tatum and Brown have it in them if they haven't figured out how to rally their team, they've already been in the playoffs for years.  They drop buckets and play well but they don't inspire others."

Erik Spoelstra for Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving. Just joking. That’s unfair for the Heat.
"In a vacuum yeah Irving is better but I'm talking about consistency, and Lowry has been way more consistent than Kyrie ever since the Cavs won the title  I also think it's closer than you think. Irving is an other worldly scorer but beyond that what does he bring? Lowry is a good scorer who is also good to great at every other asset of the game."
"I share your enthusiasm, but I’m also gonna be really honest here. Kyle Lowry is not better than Kyrie Irving. Better PG? Absolutely (Look no further than Kyrie vacating his position to Harden last season). However, Kyrie Irving is a special, special basketball talent."
"The return was jalylen, Tatum, and then trading the pick that became Colin Sexton for Kyrie Irving. Take a lap"
It’s crazy how much damage these guys are willing to take when there’s pretty much a 99.99% chance they’ll be fine. Like if Kyrie Irving got vaccinated today he’d probably forget it about in like 2 weeks lmao. I wonder if he’d feel stupid doing all that for nothing lol.
Highly doubt Kyrie Irving is a stats guy
Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Jay Huff  Unstoppable
Nets Lakers:  1. James Harden 2. Kyrie Irving 3. Lebron James 4. Kevin Durant 5. Anthony Davis
"Just because Irving and Kemba can score doesn't make them bad playmakers.   Kyrie has always been a high level facilitator and Walker was the best pick and roll ballhandler in the league before he started to lose a step, and he's still great at it.  You're also forgetting Hayward."
"Bulls are really fun this year on the court, but part of the appeal of keeping up with the NBA is the off-court drama/soap opera of it all. This year, Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving have been big stories, for example."
"meh dude formed a roster of  kyrie irving, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, gordon hayward, al horford, terry rozier, and marcus morris  thats a really fucking good team. like.. really good lol.   but got hit with basically worst case scenario and then the celtics were too content with not making moves after it fell apart  while he made mistakes, he did legitimately form an amazing team in 2018. just unfortunate that it didnt work out"
He needs to go to the Kyrie Irving school for little guards whose shot you can't block
"Yeah I’m sorry they did nothing wrong.  Any competent GM makes that trade 100/100 times.  Did I hate seeing IT go? Damn straight, but at the time getting Kyrie Irving fresh off a championship in Cleveland?  Seriously the narrative that NBA nephews spew is nonsense."
Jason Tatum is a dollar store Kobe if Kobe learned to be a star from Kyrie Irving.
"Lol what a shitty comment. In 2018 they had the potential to be something much much better than whatever they are now. It was a mixture of poor drafting, poor asset management, and the ever elusiveness of Kyrie Irving."
&gt;  tried to scapegoat Kyrie   Lol he played for them three seasons ago and was rightfully shit on for his catastrophic performance against the Bucks. Who the hell is blaming Kyrie Irving for the problems of the 2020-21 Celtics?
Answer: LeBron has played with &gt;!8!&lt; number 1 overall picks.  They are:  &gt;!Shaquille O’Neal (1992)!&lt; &gt;!Joe Smith (1995)!&lt; &gt;!Dwight Howard (2004)!&lt; &gt;!Andrew Bogut (2005)!&lt; &gt;!Greg Oden (2007)!&lt; &gt;!Derrick Rose (2008)!&lt; &gt;!Kyrie Irving (2011)!&lt; &gt;!Anthony Davis (2012)!&lt;
"Just shut up you sound like a moron.  A player’s trade value can go from low to nearly untradable, Kyrie Irving is in a similar position."
"That is because among 7 footers Giannis is the most skilled and athletic of them, that doesn't mean that he is more skilled than Kyrie Irving, James Harden or Stephen Curry.  Giannis is skilled for his size, but if you could magically have Steph be 7ft while maintaining his skill and coordination, it wouldn't even be close, that's why people are jealous of his physical gifts.  People didn't act this way with Shaq btw, Shaq was even more of a freak than Giannis, but nobody tried to act like Shaq was more skilled than AI or that he was a super skilled player when comparing him to guards."
"Well, they did play H2H against each other last year and KD did in fact outplay Giannis. KD averaged 35/11/5 to Giannis 32/13/3, it was close, but KD was the better player, Giannis had the healthier team.  The physical aspect is true aswell and Harden has expressed this sentiment before, If Kyrie Irving was 7 ft tall he would be the best player in the league, Giannis didn't have to work to be his size, it was a gift."
"If you're going to make a post about someone else these days it has to be Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving or Scottie Barnes. Didn't you get the memo?"
Probably pissed off at the whole Kyrie Irving situation. Harden is struggling as well and he's the only guy they can count on. It's like he's back in Oklahoma City.
Fucking Kyrie Irving being a shitty person
"Kyrie Irving.  - Misses 30 games per season  - is hurt every year but two in the playoffs  - has failed everytime at doing anything positive as the best player on his team (including in the non Lebron minutes in Cleveland)  - has never made anybody better despite being a point guard   Insanely talented scorer who got hot at the perfect time, but if he didnt get drafted by the franchise near the birthplace of a top 2 player of all time he'd be viewed as a slightly better Kemba"
"there are always going to be a few idiots here and there, but the vast majority have maintained that the Nets are in the top tier of title contenders, even with a fully healthy Kyrie Irving deciding not to play."
"""Is LeBron James a father figure to you?"" Now that would put many so called examples of microaggression to shame.  In hindsight if anyone should be the subject of such a dastardly question, it should be Kyrie Irving. It is oddly fitting."
"“James Harden is done being bailed by the refs and Kyrie Irving is a fuckwad. I’m tryna get traded, the fuck you think I’m doing?”  \-KD, probably"
"I think his case for usefulness is basically figuring out if he's Kyrie Irving or Lou Williams. He's not a playmaker, he's just a flat out undersized scorer so the question is will his scoring, particularly his ISO scoring, hold up in the playoffs? Because then he would still be very useful.  My feeling is it's not going to hold up to a Kyrie level based off the eye test.. he doesn't have that skill level that Kyrie has. Sexton compensates by playing hard and credit to him for that. But eh honestly I don't know and we may not know for a long time because it may be a while until he makes the playoffs."
He's a taller Kyrie Irving so IDK
Friendly reminder that JJ went to the same “higher learning” institution as… Kyrie Irving.
lol if the Knicks had drafted Zion Williamson it's possible Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are New York Knicks right now.

Simmons and Ayton both had great games. I feel like Zions was the most memorable though, 22 points in 18 minutes, 4/4 on threes, even though the Pelicans lost that was still a fun game. Oh and on that note: Edwards, Ayton, Towns, and Bennett all won their debut. Fultz, Simmons, Wiggins, Davis, Irving, and like I said Zion all lost their debut.  ^^^hopefully ^^^there ^^^aren't ^^^any ^^^mistakes ^^^in ^^^there"

"&gt;Giannis needs ONE specific style of teammates around him because of his unique skillset. In comparison to Lebron, there is no one specific style of player or play that is required.  No, there is. He wants offball 3nD. This has been proven over and over. Giannis doesn't NEED spacing, like Lebron doesn't NEED non ball dominant players, but both REALLY want it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Maybe you want to check the usage rates of Wade, Kyrie, Davis, Westbrook if you think Lebron hasn't played with ball dominant players. 3&amp;D? That's what Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, Chris Anderson, Javale Mcgee, Deandre Jordan, Anderson Varejao, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Daniel Gibson, Mo Williams, Drew Gooden, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis are all about! /s  You wrote /s but this actually sounds like an argument, so I'm not sure whether to reply or not. Eh, whatever. Take care."
Zero hard feelings between Kyrie Irving and the city of Boston.
"[Laughs in Paul George, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving]"
"Kyrie Irving is a fucking idiot, respectfully."
Because their teams sucked and their coaches sucked. Do Dwayne Wade and Kyrie Irving add nothing? What about the role players they were surrounded with? Got Tyronne Lue and Spoelstra among top coaches in the league even post LBJ. They completely changed teams; they didn’t just start playing with Lebron.
Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving 🤝 Kyrsten Sinema  Being difficult to feel important
Most 1st overall picks wouldn’t.  If they were in this last draft class at 23;  Anthony Davis wouldn’t have gone 1  Kyrie Irving wouldn’t have gone 1  Jalen Green wouldn’t have gone 1
"You argue like Kyrie Irving yet see yourself as an intellectual lmao. “What does sycophant mean to you?” And again… bringing up some next shit with the “bib” talk. Do you *ever* answer things?  Also, what does porridge mean to you? Define porridge."
Ill take one unvaxxed Kyrie Irving please. I can offer a fresh Kevin Love.
"I mean, to pretend like it *isn't* a basketball issue is to be willfully deluded. Kyrie Irving is a basketball player who isn't allowed to play basketball games at his home basketball arena, and the basketball team who employs him is struggling as a result of his decision.   Sure, if Kyrie got vaxxed and walked back all of his dangerous rhetoric and it caused a significant portion of people to also get vaccinated, that would be a great thing for the world in general. But if Kyrie digs his heels in and gets traded to Minnesota for some junk and it keeps the NBA title race wide open... Well that's a good thing for basketball fans '_'"
"I don't get why it's such a big deal if Kyrie is vaxxed or not. Beal is not vaxxed, from what I know of, and he's playing. There's a bunch of other dudes not vaxxed and no one cares to talk about them but Irving is a huge topic of discussion."
"God, Kyrie Irving is so smart, and cool, and brave. I wanna be just like him. Anyone got any tips?"
"It’s called the Dunning-Kruger Effect, but I feel it should be renamed to the Kyrie Irving Effect, like how ALS is colloquially called Lou Gehrig’s Disease"
"he's getting penalized for all nyc games according to spotrac.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/kyrie-irving-8051/  just scroll down to the transactions.  unfortunately for the nets owner, i don't think this reduces his cap hit/luxury tax burden, and the money might go to charity rather than back to the owner."
Need to trade a vaccine to Kyrie Irving
"[Woj] Kyrie Irving had been kidnapped, sources tell ESPN"
"""Kyrie Irving FLAT out betrayed you!""  No pun intended 😂"
Kyrie Irving is such a problematic bitch like what the fuck is he doing. Why would anyone want this guy on their team
Are we getting a preview of post-NBA Kyrie Irving?
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"I think it honestly shocked the Nets, they weren’t prepared for that to happen to Patty Mills and it really hurt their offense. Kyrie Irving aside, if Joe Harris was out there then maybe the triangle and 2 wouldn’t have worked as well. But besides the defensive scheme, the warriors were all over defenders and passing lanes. A lot of strips and deflections. Great effort"
the decision to go to Brooklyn was fine.  The problem was going there to play with kyrie Irving
I don't think anyone is under false impressions though. The team has made it clear that he has no chance of playing until he is vaccinated and he has made it clear that he doesn't want to be vaccinated. I don't think anyone is waiting with baited breath for Kyrie's return. Also they've already worked out the details of his contract (he's gonna be paid for every game he was eligible to play in unvaccinated) so we don't get the Kyrie Irving has depression but the Nets don't believe him saga.
Chris Bosh (that season after LeBron left before the blood clots)  Brandon Ingram   Kuzma (so far)  Danny Green (post first Cavs stint)   Kyrie Irving before he absolutely meltdown after his injury that first season   Schroder so far is looking as if he’ll have a career year   Korver   I’m not tryna give an entire list but these are prominent examples of players who were “trash” and slandered a lot for being no help
Kyrie Irving is the most skilled player the NBA has ever seen
I wonder what Kyrie Irving is doing at this exact moment.
kyrie irving exists
"While the 76ers struggle to look for a team to trade for all star point guard Ben simmons, they should at least consider a three way deal that involves Kyrie Irving and Russel Westbrook. It is proven that irving is lost because of the vaccine issue and basically the nets seems to already move on from him since they already have harden and Patty mills. Nets seem to lack a facillitator point guard not a scorer so simmons might be a good fit. Westbrook on the other hand seems to struggle to fit in the laker culture with all these lowest of low games despite having highest of high games(which he is not consistent with) so he seems to be quite fit when he plays with a team with at least 1 allstar big in the name of Joel Embiid, embidd plus westbrook would be a threat to the pick and roll game and would crush the boards and wreck havoc inside. Then that puts us left with irving going to LA, him reconciling with bron + playing with AD(a better PF than love) would make a lot more sense. Considering irving is also lost without bron, this trade would really make sense and would shock the whole nba."
Still not convinced when it comes to the warriors they faced the Nets without kyrie the wise one Irving and no Joe the Goat Harris and plus KD wasn’t even trying this game so in my book the warriors are still frauds with an easy schedule 😤
This team is going to be crazy when they bring back Kyrie Irving
Where is Kyrie Irving when you need him
"Traded him before or after you failed to treat his injury effectively turning his carreer into a big what if like Grant Hills?  Your office your staff was incompetent with dealing with another human beings health.  And when shit hit the fan they discard him.  Dont you do this BS of trading him to a contender speech.  You know damn well what your franchise did to this man.  And lets get this straight you didnt trade him to a ""contender"" out of the kindness of your heart.  You did it because you got Kyrie freaking Irving for it.  No morality was involved in this decision stop trying to make it look so."
"The best version of this rivalry would be one where Harden falls into the abyss and gets replaced by a vaccinated Kyrie Irving. KD and Kyrie is just such a better duo, and more fun to watch."
"Now imagine these too at full strength (real life : 70%klay and no irving , wishful : klay at 100 and kyrie back"
"Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Ja Morant"
"""Anthony Davis led his team to a title"" lmao    That's the equivalent of saying ""Klay Thompson led the Warriors to a title"" or ""Kyrie Irving led the Cavs to a title""    No, he played sidekick to the greatest player in NBA history. He didn't lead shit. We're seeing right now what happens when AD has to lead a team."
"An argument can be made that Tatum has not been better than a LaVine for a second of their careers. Since Tatum has joined the league, Zach has averaged 25/5/4 on 58% TS to Tatum's 19/6/3 on 56% TS.  Zach has had the misfortune of playing for terrible teams for literally his entire career while Tatum was drafted by a 53-win team that also acquired Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward before he ever played an NBA game."
Kyrie Irving has entered the chat
Kyrie Irving out for tonight's game
GM LeBron of the Lakers has a agreed to a trade with the Brooklyn Nets sending LeBron James &amp; Anthony Davis to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Lakers are also throwing in 4 future 1st round picks (no protections).
"Ben Simmons for Kyrie Irving would've been interesting. Both talented, but neither are playing at the moment due to personal issues. Kyrie with Embiid would be filthy, I think. Same for Simmons with Harden and KD."
Kyrie Irving: 0/0/0 29.8 mil
That's literally everything on this sub. Its all massive circle jerks where any opinion that runs counter to popular opinion will immediately be met with a barrage of instant downvotes.   Here's a quick example of how ridiculous it has become on this sub.   [In a comment thread about Kyrie Irving vs. Stephen Curry](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qtds9x/what_are_some_popular_casual_myths_and_wrong/hkj3y2d/) I was downvoted to -25 with no responses for pointing out the things that Kyrie is statistically better at than Curry and suggesting that there is a case that Kyrie is a better playmaker than Curry.
"[Woj] Kyrie Irving is still a moron, per sources"
"Yeah, probably even more if you replaced Kyrie Irving with Klay Thompson and Blake Griffin with Draymond Green"
"I mean, as of today this applies to Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis."
Kyrie Irving is pretty amazing player but his dad is in the convo of one of the GOATs along with MJ and Kareem. Compared to that KAI is only decent.
"Definitley. I don't think they're that good. I have Miami, Milwaukee and probably Philadelphia above them in the East and I don't think Kyrie Irving changes that."
I straight up forgot Kyrie Irving existed. In that sense I'm blown away by how the story just died. Of course they're the best.
"&gt; There’s a reason Klay was the one guarding James Harden,Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving during those warriors playoff runs  The question is about the Regular Season.   Likewise there can be other reasons why Klay guards opposing PGs - to conserve Steph's energy on offense, to prevent Steph from getting into foul trouble, etc.   Same reason Battier sometimes guarded the best opposing wing over LeBron."
"Steph is okay on defense but he’s allowed to roam way more since he’s always on the weakest offensive guard. There’s a reason Klay was the one guarding James Harden,Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving during those warriors playoff runs"
Kyrie “please take me back I’m sorry” Irving
Kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons
And even Kyrie Irving is pretty fast. He had the 2nd highest speed at the 2011 draft combine. This is why guards tend to fall off a cliff once their athleticism goes. Kemba still has sick handles but he’s not fast anymore so he barely gets to the rim.
Kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons take your pick  Ik it must be tough choosing between both of these incredible flawless players
"Kyrie Irving very very easily, achilles or not."
"I'd rather have literally any player in the NBA than Kyrie Irving, let alone one of the greatest shooters in NBA history"
"well yes, but there is a reason for this, steph shoots more 3's than 2's, kyrie irving however shoots far more 2's than 3's"
&gt; I've seen some People on YouTube say this.  And some people on YouTube think the vaccines have microchips and think Kyrie Irving is smart.
He's a good playmaker. And lmao rebounding. Kyrie Irving does not need to rebound the ball. This is why Reddit is dumb. Sure he's not a elite defender or rebounder and you can use that as your superficial little mark against him but guess what he's still an NBA level defender and athlete and that's all that matters. The real margins to be gained are on offense in this sport
"&gt;Kyrie Irving belongs on any top 75 list   for fucking what lol? He was the second best player on a championship team once. He has never been in MVP conversations, imploded the Eastern favorite celtics, doesn’t make his teammates better, and has played 3 healthy seasons in his 10 season career.   absolute clown take just because muh handles"
Kyrie Irving is Better than Vince Carter nd Yao Ming nd Mutombo
"LeStans: ""you guys severely underrate the great Ho Grant and Bill Wennington. Also, Kyrie Irving and Chris Bosh suck, and Dwyane Wade was a walking injury"""
Like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love?
Lebron had a mentally stable Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love to win one championship.  Jordan won three titles with a similar caliber supporting cast and basically won those three titles all by himself.
"See: Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Jon Gruden, Henry Ruggs, Damon Arnette  Pole Assassin's monkey story is up in the air"
That first sentence is some Kyrie Irving word salad nonsense.
"I'm not trying to say Seth didn't do a sweet package here, I'm just honestly baffled how, in 30 years...""one of the best plays I've ever seen"" would imply this is better than almost *ALL* of the best dunks, crossovers, alley-oops, blocks, steals, pump fakes, passes...from some of the best careers in the NBA. I've been watching the NBA for over 20 years and I think it's common for recency bias to make people forget how amazing previous players/plays were.   This is a sharp play, and if you asked is it one of the best fake outs I've seen, definitely, at least in the past 5-6 years. As far as ""sequencing"" moves goes, there are many of these that I can think of just off the top of my head. Seth Curry's brother has many and these often came against all-time great defenders. Off the top of my head:  - [Curry against Gobert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZOCU2ZzhwE) here he gets the drop on Gobert with a crossover --&gt; hesitation dribble sequence   - [Curry against Kawhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUF8MGH9Fh8) here he strings together a series of feints without the ball to try to lose Kawhi, and then pump fakes into a step-back 3-pointer  - [Curry against Clippers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP54guVj_XE) strings together splitting two defenders into a double crossover (in front -&gt; behind back) into a 180 degree step back 3-pointer.  Curry has many other sequences those are just the ones that occur to me most often.    Kyrie Irving has many memorable sequences: - Vs LAL: https://youtu.be/vT22q0eclyg?t=19 - Vs WAS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpSdLwz10Cs - Vs Team USA: https://youtu.be/a9MfQKnvEkk?t=5 - Vs POR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC0BukoeRQ - Vs MIL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZhpHvTmsmk  Honestly there are so many players who are crafty wizards with the ball and string together moves every night. Just google highlights of skill players like Luka, Kyrie, Joey Crawford, CP3, etc. Almost anyone who is not super athletic and uses moves and tricks to get shots off instead of just jumping over a dude or blowing by him."
In this same interview he calls Kyrie Irving the 4th best point guard of all time lmfao
Like Michael Chandler in the UFC  or a mild Kyrie Irving
"Then why are Kyrie's teams consistently bad or underperforming when he's the number one guy? His Cavs teams were picking first overall more times than not. His Boston team underperformed until he went out injured. The Nets team he led was worse than the previous season without him. Kyrie Irving has got to be the most overrated player over the last 20 years in the NBA. People say Westbrook isn't a winning player, but what makes Kyrie any different?"
"Without Lebron James, Kyrie Irving would never come close to sniffing a ring. Are we really gonna say Kyrie is better because he was on a team that got to the finals because the East was terrible and he's on Lebron's team? Dame has carried the Blazers in a way Kyrie has repeatedly proven he is completely incapable of doing as the number one guy. Just stop it."
What an absolutely ridiculous opinion.   There is absolutely no possible way any intelligent person can have Kyrie Irving over Oscar Robertson. There is absolutely no possible way that any intelligent person can have Kyrie ahead of CP3 or Nash or Stockton or Gary Payton or Steve Nash or Jason Kidd. And it's absolutely insulting to even have a Kyrie or Steph discussion.  You want to argue Chauncey or Kyrie? Fine. Kyrie over Tony Parker? Fine. Kyrie over Tim Hardaway? Fine. Kyrie or Russ? Fine. Kyrie or Dame? Fine.  But he is nowhere near John Stockton. And Deron Williams doesn't belong anywhere near this discussion.
"Lol come on now. I agree Chris is better but Irving has a meaningful impact on the floor, he can score from pretty much anywhere with great efficiency, his presence disrupts defenses. There is a reason if last year just Kyrie and Durant were blowing the Bucks out of the water."
no. there were many valid trades for him but the sixers wanted a james harden level player back. kyrie irving was the only one available

Anthony Davis DNP - Bitchitis  Kyrie Irving DNP - Mental Disability
"yeah im serious , he is the ""fakest"" superstar ive ever seen, even kobe said he could not win with his playstyle , just dribbling on top of the key , teams in the playoffs can gameplan for that easy. yeah on paper everyone is saying the nets are the best team , yeah they are good but fundamentally they are not a championship team , the have too many iso players, all there three players are iso, kyrie, durant, harden, need the ball in their hand to find a rhythm to their game, their rythm players and when you take them off their rythm the arent as effective and harden / irving have never player championship playing defense, they dont put fear on anyone being locked down by them. the kids here look at their offensive power which is fun but nobody really is scared of them in the playoffs, they aint dogs.   &amp;#x200B;  if harden was a superstar player he would ride it out with the rockets but they ended up trading, for me superstar players are the players that teams cant let go of them, like lebron and kd , these players own their franchise, they hold their future in their own hands, if you recall the teams never wanted to let them go, they went on their own, those are true superstars, players that own the owner, harden isnt one, and its funny a bunch kids here think he is one, he is good offensively but play no defense, doesnt put fear on anyone .   &amp;#x200B;  rockets fans dont miss him, and the only reason they dont talk bad about him was because the nba rigged them to get the 2nd pick so they can stay queit. If you didnt know the nba is rigged for entertainment , every player is good in the nba, its the nba that allows the players to be good."
"The Nets storyline was starting to get pretty interesting until the Irving debacle tho. They got fucked by injuries last playoffs and everyone was excited to see if LeBron, Steph, Giannis or some other player attains godhood by beating them at their healthiest. Now it's uncertain they'll be all in on winning even if Kyrie returns sometime during the season.  I personally would love to see this ""Strength in Numbers"" Warriors 2.0 get a title beating the Nets in the finals, and Steph finally getting a fmvp vanquishing 3 superstars who have had major roles in his career trajectory."
Morey needs to wake up and accept the fact that the only thing close to what he wants is a trade for Kyrie Irving.
"How is this an ego thing? He has a certain belief that vaccines are bad (sidenote: not my opinion, I am completely vaccinated). Hes not forcing his opinion on anyone else. Also he did a lot more than land one shot in the finals lol. If Kyrie Irving didn't exist, Lebron would've retired without ever getting Cleveland a championship."
I responded to one on a Kyrie Irving thread a few weeks ago and they are still DMing me three weeks later demanding I provide proof that more than 10 people died at Tiananmen Square lmao
I think because of Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving we will see the Owners try to force some kind of accountability on the Players under contract who demand a trade or flake on the organization.   Idk what it’ll be and I’m sure the NBAPA will fight it but I can’t see how it will continue as is. Owners could lockout the Players and it’s Billionaires w/ unlimited time as an Owner vs Millionaires w/ a limited playing career.   Believe this current CBA lasts until 2023-24 so Zion would be 1-2yrs into the next contract.   Only way I think it makes sense is to eliminate the Restricted Free Agency after the Rookie contract. Make it so the Rookie deals are the full 5yrs and then Players hit Unrestricted Free Agency vs the 4yrs and RFA or being forced to take the Qualifying Offer in the 5th season to be free.   If you remove the RFA then Players will only be with the Drafted team for 5yrs instead of the 8yrs they would between their Rookie and Restricted Free Agency contracts. That should also force teams to get their shit together and not tank season after season.   Ben Simmons wouldn’t be on the 76ers if he was free to leave before the contract extension. He was essentially forced to take because he wouldn’t have the freedom to choose his team until he was like 27yrs old.   Teams would still be able to offer the 5yr vs 4yr contracts and potential Super-Max deals vs the standard deals in Free Agency.   Still wouldn’t help the Nets in the Kyrie situation since he’s just a full on Anti-Vax Flake who chose the Nets as a Free Agent vs being forced to play somewhere he didn’t choose.   As a Nets fan I’m starting to think when Kyrie flaked on the Nets last January it was because the Far Right failed to overthrow Democracy.   Kyrie had every chance to speak out against these clowns like Bradley Beal did but he remains silent. If he doesn’t speak out against the people using his name then he must stand with them. Funny since those are the same people who cheer on the cops after they murder minorities.
"KD and Harden as a duo are not even close to LeBron and AD. HarObese is a perpetual playoff choker who plays closer to Russell Westbrook come playoff time than AD.  Therefore, the Nets formula collapses without the cheat code that is Kyrie Irving. KD will have to carry  again in a losing effort if he doesn’t come back."
"He'd be Kyrie Irving.  Not really because of his play, mostly because of his crazy conspiracy theories.  In terms of play he'd be thought of as a top 5 point guard in any era."
Does that mean Kyrie Irving shouldn't be making layups against anyone 6'7 and taller?
"LeVert is the only guy on our team who can create for others (besides TJ McConnell) and is also our best 1 on 1 player. He's still rounding back into form after missing all that time from his surgery. If you don't watch, you gotta just look at random stats to make your points, I get it. Our team is actually functional when he plays, and when he doesn't, tonight happens.  Also ... Scoring below league average is first of all false, but also irrelevant since he was playing with and behind Kyrie Irving in Brooklyn.  TJ Warren was literally the Pacers #1 scoring option before he got hurt. He was averaging 27 ppg in the bubble ... And then he got hurt."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
&gt; The only time they were legit was in 2018 when Kyrie was their leader   Yeah the Kyrie Irving who played in 0 of our 3 ECF runs was def the only reason we were legit lol
"Other than ""The shot"" and the overall finals performance he had against the Warriors in 2016, Kyrie Irving's career is not that impressive. He's always injured, always missing games for odd reasons too, has never carried a team. In fact, all the teams he has led have been mediocre or flat out terrible, except for the Celtics that one season and he missed a ton of games that year, and they almost made the finals without him. I don't think Lillard should be in the list ahead of Howard but he should definitely be ahead of Irving."
"A million stars have been traded in recent years. Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday etc   The Blazers never seriously went after any of them. They could have beaten what some of those guys got back from the teams that traded for them."
lol idc what u say nobody wants kyrie irving who can’t play and might retire if he gets traded as opposed to westbrook
"Kyrie Irving. He's amazing with the ball, but just haven't liked a thing about him since all way back to Cleveland."

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
Kyrie Irving and Kevin loves corpse compare to the hamtpons five now?
there was never talks of trading him and it’s laughable that u call him the weak link when kyrie irving won’t even play out of stubbornness and is worse than harden
"Ben Simmons plays in an official NBA game for the 76ers again.  Trae Young dunks in an official NBA game.   Rudy Gobert hits a three pointer in an official NBA game.      Kyrie Irving gets fully vaccinated and returns to the court."
&gt;steph won a ship without  Yeah without kyrie irving and kevin love on the other team  &gt;best player of that era in kereem  I completely disagree with this kareem was the best player of the 70s but NOT the 80s
"here's a crazy counter-factual for you: what if the Celtics didn't trade for Kyrie Irving going into the 2017-2018 NBA season?  They'd have the Nets pick (turned into #8 that season), the Grizzlies pick &amp; the Kings pick along with Smart, Rozier, the Jays etc.  Instead of trading for Kyrie, if the Celtics keep those picks they could've drafted SGA in the 2018 draft or potentially packaged the last Nets pick, the Kings pick &amp; the Grizzlies pick to Sacramento for De'Aaron Fox.  The Celtics then could've had FOx/Brown/Tatum with enough complimentary pieces left over to make some noise immediately"
"Using this list and your assists #s above, here's assists per game (from most):  * Anthony Davis:	2.05  * Kevin Love:	1.59  * Chris Bosh:	1.35  * Kyle Kuzma:	1.35  * Zydrunas Ilgauskas:	1.22  * Dwyane Wade:	1.15  * Drew Gooden:	1.15  * Mo Williams:	1.04  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:	0.90  * J.R.

For fucks sake ... Did they learn nothing from having kyrie Irving on the team for a while?
It'd be closer to Tom DeLonge in terms of respect.  Joe probably doesn't even know who Kyrie Irving is
"Minus the 2 decades of influence on pop music and fashion, sure.   Kanye is eccentric and unstable, but he's a lot closer to David Bowie than Kyrie Irving"
"That Celtics team the next season consisted of Kyrie Irving, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, and Shane Larkin. They were not gonna take another guard"
Kyrie Irving talking with Joe Rogan and Alex Jones about illuminati conspiracy theories is something I’d pay to watch.
[Woj] Kyrie Irving still stupid
Kyrie Irving was born in Australia and has a career high of 57 points
"Kyrie Freaking Irving, damn"
"Shit is hilarious. As if retaining Al Horford or Kyrie Irving would have been worth it. And Hayward brought the biggest TPE in history, Terry Rozier brought Walker, and Marcus Morris is a bona fide bum who makes 72 million now."
"&gt; i think so, but i think the same for all top-10 level guys.  I remember Joakim Noah was top 5 in mvp voting one year. A lot of it is based on narrative. I have little doubt that Luka will win MVP one day because of how much volume stats he puts up and how great of coaching his team has.   &gt;a range or level you think luka actually is vs. what people think he is?  Last year Luka started with like 60% TS and the Mavs were like a middle of the road playoff seed team at the very start of the year. His reputation immadetly went to a top 5 MVP player and he carried a lot of that reputation for most of the year despite his efficiency cooling down and his team going down the rankings. His stock is lower than this point of the season last year. The Idea that Trae may be a comparable player wasn't even entertained but this year at least it is discussed. However, the Mavs got on a slight tear where Luka did amazing recently. I think prior to this year people thought he was a top 5 player but he is like a top 12ish player. I think he is considerably worse than those players who can play both sides of the ball like Kawhi, Lebron, Giannis, and Embiid, and he is also worse than those players that can both play make and shoot well like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard. I think he is closer to Kyrie Irving than he is to James Harden in terms of how good he is."
hilarious that bill simmons thought a team who made the ECF and then added Kyrie Irving would be good at winning basketball games
"Lol the Celtics asset management the last few years have been awful. Here are some names that the Celtics have lost for nothing:  Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris. If that’s not bad asset management, then I don’t know what is."
"&gt;But Steph is an S-tier character while he has the ball and is also S-tier without it  What? S-Tier typically means the best you can possibly be, and he isn't on that Lebron or Harden level of offensive talent on ball. His passing, while good, is nowhere near theirs. Nor is his ability to break down opposing defenses on ball. He can't be rated S-tier at something he both does not do very often (hence the surge after Draymond returned) nor does at the level of the actual S-Tier players.  &amp;#x200B;  And right now, Harden is playing with Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving and it's still better for him to be on ball than anyone else on the team. He's averaging the most assists in the NBA by a lot while putting up a very efficient scoring season. You can't hold what he does off ball against him when the only person in the NBA that might be better than him on ball is Lebron James. It's just not an indictment on him that he's so good at running an offense.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Harden himself awknowleged you can't really win playing that kind of hero-ball  This is a mischaracterization of the point. He had to play that kind of basketball to win *when his teammates were that injured.* He is clearly very capable of not playing hero ball. But when you don't have the supporting cast to make it worthwhile, you do have to if you want to win. Look at how Harden's old teammates are doing without him running the show for them"
"True, and I think that's the thing that I think most players have a gripe with. But like, what are we supposed to do, not trade him for Kyrie Irving when that's on the table?"
"Disagree. Joe Harris is not essential offensively on a team that has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Kevin Durant. Your offence will be elite with or without Harris. Meanwhile you defence is turnstile regardless of who’s on the floor."
"Kyrie Irving has entered the chat, left the chat, entered the chat, is sitting on the chat, stepped out briefly from the chat, has rejoined the chat....."

"&gt; I'D RATHER BE ON VACATION SOMEWHERE. WTF. Like, that's so not higher risk of getting it. With all the restrictions NBA is holding up to it could be the safest place they will be considering how immature they are  That's another point I brought up in another thread and I got shit on for it, but it's worth mentioning. Kemba was the player who said it  You already know players like Kyrie Irving, James Harden and a lot more around the league are gonna use that little bit of off time for the season as an opportunity to vacation at crowded clubs or beaches or wherever, which will spread the virus more considering there's less testing that the NBA will be conducting on them then.  I'm not blamin them or saying they shouldn't be trusted to make their own decisions or anything like that, but if your goal is to limit the spread of a virus then bringing them all together in one spot where they can be tested (even if it sounds counterintuitive) rather than having them spread out makes more sense."
"Maybe I should've made the title ""Kyrie Irving with the solid post defense on Draymond Green before ~~getting tea-bagged by~~ *being rewarded with the teabag from* Kelly Oubre."""
"&gt; They did take that risk with Irving and he walked away,   They sent over IT, Jae, Zizic, and one pick.  That wasn't really risky at all lmfao.  I'm not saying trade away their entire future like the Nets did with Harden, but the Kyrie trade is not a good example of taking a risk to acquire top end talent."
Harden / Irving / Harris / Green / Durant is averaging a 66% TS and the low guy is Kyrie Irving at 64%.    Imagine a lineup where Kyrie Irving is your least efficient offensive player.

Kyrie Irving up there
I blame Kyrie Irving 🤷🏿‍♂️
"Damn that's long, you really wrote all this in defense of Kyrie Irving? A man who can't even be bothered to explain why he's not showing up to his job?"
"PG: Not happening and the nets already have excellent wing players.  Simmons: Why? Again, wing spots are full, and the PG spot can be run by Harden or Dinwiddie. He could be a good fit, but the Sixers aren't making that move with a direct rival.  KP: I think he's too injury prone and not as talented as Kyrie, so it's not a good value deal. I'd keep Kyrie.  Holiday: Waaaaaay below Kyrie's market value. I love Holiday's game, but there's no way I'd trade Irving for him, plus they need a front court player more than a shooting guard."
Lol these are some ridiculous ass trade scenarios. Why would those teams in the East strengthen a super team AND take on known-headache Kyrie? The amount of 2K level trades on r/nba boggles my mind. Gobert for Irving? Utah wouldn't do that in a million years.
Kyrie Irving is not a top 15 player
"Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and Anthony Davis. All of these players have been considered top 10 in the NBA at one point in their careers. I agree that LeBron is the better player. And that he makes his team better too. LeBron has had help lately too."
"No, we need Kyrie Irving. Harden and Durant can't keep playing 40 minutes a game."
"I bet the BKN under, confident Irving would do Kyrie things (he has) and KD wouldn't play B2Bs and would maybe be 90% of who he was.  The Harden trade is going to make my bet very hard to make now....and KD being closer to 100% than 90% hurts.  Still, KD had a monster game. Without it, BKN loses. I'm happy for KD and sad for my $20."
I want to add that to me the most glaring issue right now is Kyrie Irving. Not in terms of his play but because of his weird behavior. I truly believe that Celtics team that he was on could have gone all the way but he refused to buy in. This could be a 2.0 version of that. Nobody knows what that guy is thinking. I don't know if he'll be happy playing third fiddle. I don't think Harden + Durant are enough to get it done against the Lakers/Clippers/Bucks/Celtics etc. They need Irving to buy in.
kyrie irving and literally anybody else
Can only go up from here. They also have soul searcher Kyrie Irving returning from his quest of activating his third eye. Who’s to say they can’t stagger Harden and Irving to run both the first and second unit’s offense.
"They don’t have the personnel to compete? No they only have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Do you honestly believe what you write..? You could argue their center position is very weak with an aging DeAndre Jordan and a few rookies. Nonetheless they have great defenders otherwise with Harden and Bruce Brown as positive defensive guards. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet also help space the floor. The farthest the Sixers ever recently been was with Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick on their roster. You won’t even convince Sixers fans today that their current team is better than during that ‘18-‘19 season."
"No it's a binary situation and a factual statement. I'm not trying to disparage the man, or deny his skill or whatever else you might think, just stating the obvious at midnight on a Sunday. If Kyrie is playing or expected to play we can have a discussion about his standing with regards to basketball skill in the wider NBA. If he voids his contract and stops playing (note I'm not endorsing or predicting anything by saying that) then he'll have to be considered historically either by his entire career or in his prime whichever flavor of off season hypothetical suits you better. The best ability is availability and right now Kyrie Irving is unavailable for reasons best known to himself."
"Because someone will think they can do it differently and better. Someone will think ""this is Kyrie Irving we're talking about, what if it does work out?""."
"Some mediocre team may take a risk for sure but probably not this season where no fans are allowed to watch live. A bunch of solid role players is definitely better than Kyrie ""AWOL"" Irving."
That was the system Harden was put in by D'Antoni. We've seen Harden play off ball earlier in his career and is much better at it then kyrie. Therefore I think kyrie needs the ball more to succeed. Any player in that D'Antoni system would have stupid high usage rate especially with a player as good as Harden. I just think Harden is a better offball player than Irving hence my comment
Are you seriously saying Kyrie Irving is more ball dominant than James Harden? Kyrie was 22nd in time of possession in his most recent healthy season and Harden ranks first in that stat consistently
"1st game with Harden, who didn't practice. No Kyrie Irving. Are we really playing this game, my dude?"
"Yep. The New Jersey ""2019/20 Los Angeles Clippers"" Nets. Starring James ""Pandemic P"" Harden, Kevin ""Kawhi Leonard"" Durant, and Kyrie ""Pat Bev"" Irving."
As a guy who actually surfs and lives in San Diego for 10 years now I can firmly reject the notion that Kyrie sounds like a surfer. Kyrie Irving simply sounds like a dumbass
Now they’re saying it was Kyrie Irving who saved Levert’s life
"Similarly, Kyrie Irving has been in the league forever, but is a grizzled vet at 28."
"3 team trade (assuming Lowry wants out):  Tor: Harden, AD, Kyrie Irving  Nets: Lowry  Lakers: Malachi Flynn + Terrance Davis + three 2nd round picks"
No one is going to trade for Kyrie Irving. He chose to go to the Nets and look how he's been acting.. What do you think he'll do if he gets traded to Indiana? They'll never hear from him
"I know for a fact that you're wrong lmao. No team, I don't care what team it is, is going to be worse with Kyrie fucking Irving playing"
"They’re still missing this guy Kyrie Irving, he’s pretty good  They also have three empty roster spots lol"
"Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, green alien from Space Jam, Jesus Shuttlesworth, Barack Obama, Paul George is always good for a trade demand, Dr.Naismith, and you’ve gotta watch Elena Della Donne after she broke Chicago fans’ hearts."
It’s not fact. The “picks” that ended up enticing Lebron’s return were Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins as a trade piece. Both were a result of Cleveland’s poor regular season results.  The Heat ended up trading 2 low FRP and 3 SRPs. They wouldn’t have been enough to get Lebron to stay. The problem was the Heat were stuck on their 4th year over the salary cap and even keeping a MLE-salaried player was costing them 20mm+. Micky Arinson wasn’t willing to pay and the team’s depth suffered as a result.  Please think before you type.
"Maybe, but isn't KD fresh off his own injuries?  Isn't Kyrie simply absent from the team?  There's a lot more questions than answers, and it will be fun to watch their 1st disagreement right when head coach Irving comes back from his retreat or whatever he's on."
Nets trade Kyrie Irving to the Hornets for Bismack Biyombo and Terry Rozier.  Who says no??
People are underrating how great of a basketball player Kyrie Irving is. I was witnessing Peak Kyrie Irving before he took personal time off. Kyrie Irving will be the best player on the Nets some games. I wouldn’t be surprised if he wins a FMVP.
What about the whole kyrie irving being a weirdo who doesn't want to play thing?
"And they don't have a player who's going to come in and fuck up their spacing and brick shots left and right from the perimeter like a Westbrook. Kyrie takes a lot of stupid shots but he's going to hit the open looks he'll get. You're going to have to go toe to toe,shot for shot with this offense in halfcourt playoff basketball and then make shots in the last 3 minutes of the game to beat them. I don't trust any of those Eastern conference teams to be able to go shot for shot with them in the final minutes of a game.   76ers who got Ben Simmons and Bucks who got Giannis on the court closing games, y'all better hope they make their free throws. Steve Nash played this game a long time, I'm sure if it's a close game he won't hesitate to hack a Simmons or hack a Giannis just like he saw the spurs hack a shaq when he played with him.   Good luck. They're gonna win a lot of games and while they might not play the best defense, all they need is one of those three to get hot and they'll be in the game and they have Harris drilling that 3 ball. All they need is a Javale McGee and another wing piece that might end up on their roster after the deadline.   Y'all wanna crack jokes on their defense but in a 120-120 game with 2 minutes left between them and the Bucks, who you betting on, Giannis, Jrue and Khris or KD, Harden and Irving?  One of those 6 players can't hit a free throw 🤷🏾‍♂️  Embiid, Simmons, Curry or KD, Harden, Irving?  One of those 6 players can't hit a free throw 🤷🏾‍♂️  It'll be Lakers Nets"
It was a stupid take for golden state. It is absolutely not a stupid take when talking about a team that has kyrie Irving.
Kevin Durant and James Harden are the best duo in the NBA. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the second best duo in the NBA. James Harden and Kyrie Irving are the third best duo in the NBA.   The Brooklyn Nets have too much talent. Would not be surprised if they go 16-0 in the playoffs. The Brooklyn Nets are very fun to watch.
"Kyrie Irving for Alex Caruso, who says no"
"Nets trade: Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan   Cavaliers trade: Colin Sexton, Jared Allen    wsn?"
"Harden and Durant isn't fair whatsoever, to think Kyrie Irving will be added to this is ridiculous"
Said this to myself watching the game. He’s a much better point guard than Kyrie and Durant and Irving off ball means you pretty much can’t help on a Harden PnR or iso.   They just need to stagger the minutes between him and Kyrie and then finish with all 3 on the court
Imagine if they also had Kyrie fucking Irving to penetrate..
They both subscribe to daily Kyrie Irving wisdom podcast
"Losing to the disgraceful Orlando Magic. The Nets lost the trade, they're a first round exit. Trade Harden for Killian Hayes, Durant to Cleveland for Sexland, and banish Kyrie Irving"
We have no Centers. We still have decent enough Depth with 2 MVPS and a Kyrie irving.
James Harden: Available   Kevin Durant: Available   Kyrie Irving: Appear away
Highly doubt it will matter much when they have 2 MVP caliber players and Kyrie Irving
"kyrie, kd, and harden aren’t players that you can just “eh, they’ll throw some guys at em”-at. they are all-nba players. three of them. on one offense. you will not be able to double-team any of them either. the nets also have incredible shooters that can space the floor and make the offense unstoppable. these three will not have their production eclipsed by one good center, or any center for that matter. these takes need to be put to rest. it does not matter if they can “match up” with giannis, bam, embiid etc. Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden, on the same court, on the same team, will comfortably nullify any impact that those individual big men have on the game."
"It is a 7-6 team, but they looked great with Irving and Durant both on court. Does it matter? I think in the playoffs it would matter more. In the season so far, Durant didn't even play half of the minutes, not to mention Kyrie who looked good but is off to something else at the moment. I wouldn't take that record as too telling then.  I guess the predictions of Nets' playoff success are assuming these star players will be available during the key series, as always a big ""if"" in NBA."
"Yall wildin lmao. They got two top 5 players and Kyrie Irving. The last time two superstars didn't make the finals was Shaq and Kobe in 03 and that was after they threepeated. Whatever, basketball is a team game--until you have KD and Harden and Kyrie. Unless Giannis starts nailing shots like KD, or Embiid and Simmons both turn into Shaq there's nobody I'd have over them even closely."
Kyrie Irving played the first 2 finals game
"It's actually shocking how many quality players Kentucky produces out vs. Duke.  I feel like so many turn into above average/All Star level players - off the top of my head: Wall, Cousins, Bledsoe, KAT, Booker, Murray, SGA, Fox, Bam...  There's probably a lot more but right now from Duke: Tatum, Kyrie, Irving, Zion"

Kyrie Irving
He's doing it as we speak.  Kyrie Irving.
"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
Try convincing Kyrie Irving to take a vaccine hahaha
"If he had to take games off for his actual mental health then fine, even if he was a total shit in terms of communication, responsibility, and overall just being a mature adult.  If this was just him throwing away money because he's an ass and he's Kyrie Irving then fuck him."

"We know why he's missing games [now](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30719193/brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-remain-sat-vs-orlando-magic-due-protocol):  &gt; On Friday, the league announced that Irving had violated the league's health and safety rules. The NBA investigated videos that began circulating on social media earlier this week that showed Irving at a family birthday party, maskless.  &gt; The league fined Irving $50,000 and announced he would forfeit his salary for the two games he missed during his five-day quarantine, which ends Saturday. According to ESPN's Bobby Marks, Irving will lose $816,898 in salary."
"Over in Japan, they’re having baseball games with half full stadiums because they all took it seriously by quarantining and distancing. They all did it together.

I pray for not only KAT (especially with everything he’s gone through), but for Rubio, Juancho, and any other players and people.  Fuck Kyrie Irving and Rudy Gobert"
"One of the reasons Irving needs to be severely punished is that his actions chase fans away from NBA basketball, altogether!  People are suffering. They were suffering before Coronavirus. Now, it’s worse and more extensive.   The last thing the average suffering American, potential NBA customer, wants to see is rich, pampered athletes, not even showing up to work, and still getting paid tens of millions of dollars a year, while they’re home suffering emotionally and financially.   Kyrie is basically spitting in the face of the average American consumer."
The NBPA have one vice-president in Kyrie Irving. So now what does all this mean to you?

"&gt; If I hire people to fix my roof, they do not become my property (implying that I have infinite jurisdiction over them).  Not only are you getting hung up on the word ""property"" which I pointed out in my original post, but this is a terrible analogy. If your roofer decides he doesn't want to fix your roof any more, you can sue him and hopefully get your money back and hire another roofer. In the NBA there is a limited amount of talent and the skills and reputation of that talent is differentiated. Kyrie Irving is an incredibly popular player along with being someone who could help you win a championship. Losing that player is much more of an issue for an organization than you losing out on your first choice roofer. The roofer is much more replaceable.   I don't want to talk about the semantics of the word ""property""."

"Anybody else think it is bizarre that this is the president of the player's association, and his VP is Kyrie Irving?"
"Not sure where you’re look but he has earned 160 million dollars from the NBA alone. That’s ignoring his signature shoe deal, pepsi commercials, and any other endorsements he has( hubba bubba and what not).  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/kyrie-irving-8051/cash-earnings/"
"“You’re welcome team, I GOT JAMES HARDEN to this team during my hiatus. I had to envisioned it in my 3rd brain and it came true.” - Kyrie Irving."
"Outside of flipping Kyrie for other assets, was getting Irving really in the Rockets best interest anyway?  Kyrie + Wood is not going to win you anything even if he was motivated to play with the Rockets.  You weren't going to get the same collection of picks if you took Kyrie so I think they probably did about as well as they could in this trade scenario.  I think I still would have taken a package around Ben Simmons (depending on what the rest of the return was) but Oladipo + depth + a million first round picks seems about as good as you are going to get."
I'm sorry but this sub is filled with delusional Lebron and Laker fans. If you actually think Dennis Schroder and Harrell are comparable to having Kyrie Irving as your 3rd option you're not very smart. The Lakers are screwed
"I don't like the word ""forfeit"" in the title. He didn't show up for work, so it should be more like ""Kyrie Irving will be docked pay $816,898 for the 2 games missed this past week."""
"I think they will be unstoppable offensively but will need to get a few defensive pieces at the deadline/buyout market. Literally all they need is like 3 other bodies that can defend and this team can win it all. I see them running through the East just obliterating teams.   The only hope of this not meshing would’ve been Durant not being back to himself but he is, now add prime Harden and then add a Kyrie Irving that is balling when he’s on the court. That is simply unstoppable."
I’m taking bets on the next Kyrie Irving drama 20 games over/under?
"This is why I don't like the Kyrie Irving.  He acts like he's all about deeper thought, and acts like his job is trivial in the grand scheme of things... which is true in reality, but the ""realer"" reality is he could have played those two games, made a million fucking dollars, and donated it. Whatever bullshit he thinks, his general time is not more valuable than his time playing basketball. He can join a fucking zoom call with social activists, but he doesn't add shit to that and it doesn't actually achieve anything. He'd be better off using the talent he actually does possess, and then forward that to a cause he believes in.  Instead, he saved a billionaire a million dollars.  ... So I don't fault him for his beliefs, but I fault him for his inability to use basic god damn logic, then smugly act like he's better and smarter than everyone else around him. The dude is actually too fucking stupid to help the people he may genuinely want to help."
Kyrie Irving really out here trying to give his ‘95 Jordan impression.  I swear one of these days he’s gonna arrange a media conference and the first words you’ll hear from him is: “I’m back’   That’s when I’m gonna roll my eyes so hard that I’m gonna go blind
She said this directly to Kyrie Irving. Don't deliberately take things out of context.
"lol what kind of stupid are you?  You would bet EVERYTHING you own that a team with a prime Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving have no shot at coming close to winning a title?"

that is literally what happened  https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/kyrie-irving-district-attorney-candidate-nets-nuggets-game/1ftvv2pmpdu6d1i6nsx74uxqwd
"i think the zoom meeting was like 30 mins prior to tip off for a game, he coulda done it remotely from the stadium and kept a cool $400k.  https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/kyrie-irving-district-attorney-candidate-nets-nuggets-game/1ftvv2pmpdu6d1i6nsx74uxqwd  The event began at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday. The Nets and Nuggets tipped off at the Barclays Center around 7:30 p.m. ET.  but tipoffs are usually 30 mins late right?"
"Wasn’t even the dumbest shit she said this week  &gt; So I will tell you this, I was thinking of all the conversations I’ve had with Kyrie (Irving) through the year,” said MacMullan around the 15-minute mark of the podcast. “One of them I had, I don’t know, two years ago,   we got into an argument about, you know, something. And he’s like, ‘Well there shouldn’t be an NBA draft. Players should be able to go wherever they want to go. We’re not, you know, someone’s property.’ And I’m like, yeah you are dude. That’s the way it works.”"
"Sorry if you think I am being rude to you but how do you take what Kyrie is saying as joke, I don't see nor his facial expressions nor his tone as someone who is joking. Not trying to be an armchair analyst of a 30 second of a random Durant-Irving talk and I am not taking it seriously just to me it seems like he has belief in what he is saying."
"I'm 50/50 on the whole thing.   Harden wanted out and made it known in the offseason, so there's that looming over the whole deal. Also, with his weight gain, comments, and play Harden was clearly done with the Rockets (though he was still under contract so yeah).   Irving had it in his mind that he did not under any circumstances wish to get traded and made himself untradeable now and in the future. I don't think anyone outside of Brooklyn shows interest in Irving again.  Houston wasn't dealing Harden to Philly, so really Brooklyn was the only organization in contention from the jump.   So this deal happened due to narrow circumstances that only allowed Harden going to Brooklyn without giving up Kyrie. Harden was done, Irving refused to be traded, and Houston wouldn't deal with Philly."
"I, for one, am shocked that Kyrie Irving has rediscovered his love of basketball after the Nets trade for James Harden."
The Kyrie Irving Flat Earth Awareness Fund.
"I don't think anyone ever had trouble pronouncing Dwyane Wade's or Antawn Jamison's names, despite the weird spellings. And sportswriters (and their editors) knew to spell those names correctly every time, too. We know that Jimmy Butler's first name is literally Jimmy. Kyrie Irving has an upward inflection in his first name (but is often ignored when pronouncing his full name).  And Shaquille's own name was probably pronounced incorrectly quite a bit before he became a superstar and household name, and I'm guessing that's a big part of the reason why he became known as Shaq."
"There are still a lot of questions about the Nets. On offense, I do wonder whether Kyrie Irving and James Harden can accept fewer touches.  Irving has a history of resenting a secondary role, and here he would be asked to accept a tertiary role.  Harden also left Oklahoma in part because he wanted to be the primary option, and he thrived in that role, but he apparently had trouble sharing the ball with Chris Paul and Westbrook.  Durant is the only one of the three who has proven he can thrive without the ball in his hands all the time.   At least we know all of them *can* be superstars on offense. Will they play defense?  Will they have enough help to play defense?  It's by no means certain that they will dominate the East, let alone the NBA.  As for Houston, when you have an unhappy superstar with inadequate support and decide to rebuild, yes, this is the kind of trade you get.  All things being equal, it's not a fair trade.  But under the circumstances, it was the best trade they could get, and they had to do it.  So I don't blame them at all for taking what they could get and focusing on a rebuild."
Exum went to the Rockets.  Another this sub might remember is Isiah Thomas to the Cavs for Kyrie Irving.

Best handles in the history of human mankind. Kyrie Irving
Has Kyrie Irving been playing this way his whole career? Even when he won the Ring with Lebron and was on top of the world? Are you telling me he suddenly became some selfish player now that he's with Harden and Durant? Did people hate on him his game so hard when he was going to finals with Lebron?   The disrespect i was also referring to was all those people actually talking about him being Harden and Durant's chaffeur like he's some bum compared to them ability wise in the game of basketball. Like he's some distant thrid option. Any of those 3 guys could be first option on any given night. Give them all their respect accordingly. No need to shit on Kyrie to praise Durant and Harden.
Kyrie Irving punched Harden in a brawl and Durant is breast feeding him.
"Genius? They just throwing that word out these days. smh. Einstein, Hawking , Kyrie Irving"
"It's only a dumb take to you because you're too dense to understand that the harder you are to replace the more leeway you get. Not once did I say this should be excused.   It's also very obviously not ok with the Nets either considering all of their comments have been they don't know and hope that it is justified. But they aren't going to do anything because it's Kyrie Irving and he can get away with a lot. Crying about how you wouldn't be able to do the same at your job is idiotic, that was my point."

The Los Angeles Lakers don’t have a player with the clutch gene. The Brooklyn Nets are fortunate to have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on their team. They were born with the clutch gene. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league.
Are we not considering Kyrie Irving from New Jersey?   EDIT: oops nevermind should have read the FAQ section!
"Nice to see you backtrack from saying Lebron carried.  In 2016, Kyrie Irving averaged 27ppg on 47/41/94 shooting splits, 3.9 assists and 2.1 steals. They had similar shooting splits, but Kyrie average more points, which is far more important in the finals. In the finals Kyrie was definite a better player than AD. And this is all disregarding the fact Kyrie played a 73-9 warriors team, and AD played a depleted Heat team."
I would rather have a James Harden and Kyrie Irving duo over LeBron James and Anthony Davis duo. Kyrie Irving and James Harden is the greatest backcourt of all time. People are sleeping on Kyrie Irving.

The Kyrie Irving hate is exhausting and overblown tbh - it's so trendy to shit on him right now for whatever reason
"I think returns for disgruntled star players shouldn't be hit too badly.   Out of those 15 teams, 8 of them still have some kind of future 1st to offer, and there's always the chance that they offer more in terms of players, or that they trade rookies right after draft day that they wouldn't be able to trade in advance as picks.  Some of those teams may not even be in the market for another star. I don't know how much a 4th star would add to the Nets, if they could even fit one on the payroll. If they're sending out Kyrie Irving; there's even less incentive to make the trade because they're not upgrading by as much."
"And the winner with 18 votes is RekeHavok and Irving henceforth shall be referred to as kyrie “missing in action” Irving.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your time."
"We have seen Joe Harris without Durant/Harden/Irving.   He had every chance to be the man last year when Kyrie missed practically the entire season, and they chose to mainly feature an offense designed for Dinwiddie and LeVert. Who are good players, don't get me wrong, just not on Butler or Dragic's class. The Heat featured Duncan super heavily in their offense, despite having other excellent backcourt options."
"Yes im very sure my dislike of kyrie irving has bled into my life, you really got me. I wqtch basketball here and there guy,  im a football guy first.

Youre defending a man who used his family as a lie to go party with people, guys actual scum but defend him all you want since you clearly just wanna talk shit about me instead of disproving why anything i said was wrong   Thanks for kinda proving my point, the only defense kyrie fans have is “actually youre a loser leave him alone :(“ this guy gets infinite free passes because hes an idiot and a conspiracy theorist so people feel bad for him lamo, imagine being an NBA star and being pitied by people"

" Playoff strategy is about optimizing roles, not indulging weaknesses. Simple example is the Lakers last year, the only two people on the roster that handled the ball were LeBron and Rondo. The Lakers didn't say ""hey let's allow KCP to run some PnR because he's decent at it"" or ""how about AD leads the break"" or ""You know Kuzma should ISO a little"".   The Warriors are not a model for future championship teams and the sooner NBA fans realize that the better. The Warriors had literally perfectly optimized pieces and players hit the league with an absurd, never before seen cheat code in Curry who was a threat to score efficiently from 30+ feet regardless of how much space he had.  Kyrie never ""ran the offense"" in Cleveland, he was used as an offball scorer, pretty much a shooting guard. In fact that was one of his complaints on the way out.   &gt; ""I'm ecstatic,"" Irving said. ""I'm just looking forward to playing my position. I'm looking forward to becoming something that I've always envisioned myself being -- and that's being a complete point guard on a great team. I want to be able to come off pick-and-rolls and be able to dissect the defense, and be able to have guys that -- this is not a knock on anybody that I was playing with, but **my role was completely different (in Cleveland).**""  Source: https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2017/09/kyrie_irving_wants_to_be_a_com.html  People have to get it out of their heads that the way to play is like the Warriors, it's not going to happen again."
"KD, Harden, and Kyrie have been working out with each other since [as early as 2018](https://heatnation.com/videos/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-and-james-harden-link-heat-offseason-work/)  It's not a stretch to suggest that Harden were talking about linking up with KD &amp; Kyrie as earlier as their 2019 FA. Around the same time as Harden leveraging the Rockets to get Russ."

"i think he is already consider one of the best scorer of all time. but my hypothetical is that if he didnt play on these supremely offensively talented teams and somehow won two championships with a normal championship level team, 2011 mavs, 2015 warriors, 2019 raptors, i think a lot more people would undoubtly put him in the top 10 all time players easily. Whereas even if he won with harden and kyrie irving, i really dont think he would be consensus better than wilt, magic, bird, tim duncan, kobe, jerry west, big o, hakeem, shaq"
"Imagine it's something totally justified, and if you're having personal or family issues it's actually totally fine to be able to hop on a zoom call about social justice even if you don't feel okay to play games.  I wonder how many people here would feel like complete jackasses if they knew the full story. Life lessons. I'm sure if DeMar missed some time for personal reasons and didn't want to get into it, everyone would have the same responses as they did for Irving.  For the slow kids in the back: If someone's having a tough time and needs to miss work, that doesn't mean they're faking it if they go to a movie or do something enjoyable in the meantime. You can not feel well enough to perform at work, and still do something fun to take your mind off, you don't have to sit in your bed crying all day for it to be a justified leave of absence. People using the fact that Kyrie was on a zoom call as proof that his life wasn't in complete shambles or whatever, so dumb.   Obviously he didn't handle everything perfect, but its so funny seeing all your drama frogs with such double standards."
We just beat the Lakers with a sorry ass G-League squad /s  The way I see it is two things.   Will DeAndre Jordan be able to hold his own against the premiere bigs in the league?   And how will the Nets integrate Kyrie Irving back? There is only one ball and one of those 3 will have to take a step back... the last two games it was good to see Harden facilitate and distribute the ball. His assist numbers are going through the roof this season.   Your thoughts?
Lol Kyrie Irving is a much better offensive player than Klay Thompson. This isn’t even debatable.
"Sorry, not sorry. Lets move on - Kyrie Irving."

"What makes you think the organization was fine with it? He ghosted the front office and coach. They had no clue why he wasn't showing up and were completely blindsided.   &gt; “Without a doubt, I’m not going to shy away from it, without a doubt the organization is disappointed with not having any one of our players, in this particular case Kyrie, not amongst us, not in the trenches with us and so forth. And so I don’t want to speculate and say why he’s out and so forth. I’ve had conversations with him and I’ll continue to have conversations and I look forward to him being back in the gym and he will address this and we’ll sit down with him.  &gt; Asked if it was OK that Irving was missing time, Marks said, “If it’s [for] well-documented [reasons], we’ve got to support whether it’s our players or our staff, and you would do that in any industry but you also hope that there is a more than adequate excuse as to why he needs personal time and he will address that without a doubt.”  You're asking an NBA fan why they're upset that an NBA superstar decides not to play. You probably know exactly why fans would be upset with this. It makes the games less entertaining and and role players would not be able to get away with this."
"Curry literally averaged more points as a second option than Kyrie did as a first option...furthermore in 2018 Curry as a second option averaged more than Kyrie has ever averaged.

"NBA media has been trying to make false narratives against Kyrie Irving ever since he left the Cavs. He was definitely in the wrong here, but people need to at least show when he apologizes instead of going out of their way to make him look bad."

He said he didnt talk to pawns. You added the pushing propaganda part to fit your narrative. Referring to people as pawns in a dismissive context is a very common thing.   &gt; * He concluded that statement with a Star of David and talking emoji, which would seem to mean something like ""Jews talking shit"" or ""Jewish mouthpieces""  Since youre such an expert in Kyrie emoji symbology then why not explain to us why he uses the star of david on many of his other instagram posts? Or why he has the hamsa tattooed on the back of his hand? Is he trying to express his dislike of jews by tattooing jewish symbols on himself?   &gt; * [Kyrie recently shouted out Stephen Jackson and Brother Ben X](https://www.facebook.com/brotherbenx/videos/kyrie-irving/753613808552135/), who is a student of notorious anti-Semite and NOI leader Louis Farrakhan  Did you notice who Kyrie quoted in that Instagram post?

"How much _we_ fucked _him_ up? What?  When has Kyrie Irving _ever_ demonstrated that he is capable of handling ""being a professional basketball player"" - with the emphasis on _professional_?  Kyrie Irving had (has) all the tools to be one of the most successful athletes of his generation. Nobody forced him to air his private (ludicrous) thoughts. Nobody dragged him away from his career obligations for a family birthday party. Those were his decisions."
It takes mental gymnastics to suggest that Kyrie Irving (or any player) has any obligation whatsoever to bettors. Does Elon Musk have obligation to do right by the idiots over at r/wallstreetbets because they're constantly making ridiculous gambles on Tesla with margin/futures/etc.?
"This is an extreme over-simplification.  Harden is much bigger, stronger, a better rebounder, a better defender and a better passer than Irving.  He is also elite at drawing fouls, while I would say Kyrie actually tends to shy away from contact.  This is not a criticism of Kyrie per se, but watching him on the Celtics it is apparent he definitely does not rely on free throws for his offense.  Kyrie is a better ball handler (although Harden is also elite in this area) and a better jump shooter at all levels (although Harden is an above average jump shooter and elite at creating his own look)."

It is incredibly wild to accuse Kyrie Irving of being an anti-semitic Q-Anoner because he used a Star of David emoji (a symbol which he has tattooed on himself).
Kyrie Irving is a phenomenal mid-range shooter as well.
"Stop comparing yourself to Kyrie Irving. You are replaceable, you are not a major player in your company unless you're in the top 15 of the chain. It's a dumbass comparison to be making, I'm sorry but it just is. Everyone keeps saying this. You're fireable because you don't generate potentially millions in revenue. Whether we like it or not, Kyrie Irving is worth far far more than any of us for the spreadsheets, regardless of his attitude. We can condemn what he did but people gotta stop using this comparison, it's completely stupid. ALSO he has a union, and this is illustrating the good aspect of having a union."
"You really seem to be projecting here and I'm not even the other guy.  Yes you are not Kyrie Irving, and yes its a personal issue that you don't seem to be able to rectify that.  The media are like clients to the NBA, Kyrie doesn't necessarily owe them (or us) a full explanation. The team is fine with it, he obviously is back, so what is the issue?  The only people saying ""Kyrie went off the rails"" here are conveniently fans of other teams lol.  Does nobody remember when Derrick Rose was supposed to start and literally just left the arena before tipoff and left his team to dry for a month after that?

"Kyrie Irving would be the best guard to play for the heat since DWade. I can’t speculate on what you would do at the 5 (although turner would definitely do a great Bosh impression), but to say you wouldn’t trade bam for a chance at pairing kyrie with butler is very short sighted imo."

"The funny thing is, all of this behavioral shit seemingly started from how Kyrie felt about LeBron in Cleveland. Treatment he got from the organization, calling him a child to the media...   Forget the K-Love thing, did LeBron give Kyrie Irving schizophrenia?"
Yeah no shit Kyrie Irving has more leeway at his job than you do
"[Andrews: Kyrie Irving apologizes to fans he disappointed by not playing.

I just needed a pause.""](https://twitter.com/malika_andrews/status/1351597454458814473)"
"Kyrie has arguably the greatest handles of all time, and is practically unguardable himself to be honest.   Having 3 of the League's best iso players is going to be insanely difficult to stop. Cant leave KD open- he'll splash from anywhere. Can't leave Harden open either with his stepback 3 and insane driving ability. Leaving Kyrie Irving open is not recommended either, man can get past anyone with his insane handles, can shoot rly well, and his finishing is insane. And dont even get me started on Joe Harris's shooting ability. Literally 4 of the Nets players cannot be left unguarded. Quadruple Threat"
"Yeah, this is the biggest issue. I just don't see a contender wanting Kyrie because of his off the court issues, and his locker-room attitude. I can see a midling, small market team that tries for him for the superstar draw, but even that's a stretch. For better or for worse the Brooklyn Nets are married to Kyrie Irving for the majority of his current contract."
If I am the GM of the Brooklyn Nets I am not trading Kyrie Irving 😃
"So.  Harden is a better Point than Kyrie. Kyrie must become the off-guard.  Durant goes out, Harden slides to the 2 or 3. Irving moves to the point.  Harden goes out. Irving stays.   And so forth and so on.   This will not work any other way."
NBA.com actually has it    1) James Harden: 9.0 PPG  2) Kevin Durant: 8.8 PPG  3) Ja Morant: 8.8 PPG  4) Kyrie Irving: 7.8 PPG

The Nets are not trading Kyrie Irving.
Kyrie Andrew irving
Kyrie “Dwight schrute” Irving
&gt; ~~Kyrie~~ Kai Irving on Kyrie  Just because there are pandemic voices in one's head doesn't mean they get to be the main identity.
Ainge was wise not to trade for George we had good assets and a max FA slot. So if you trade for George before FA then you use the assets and the slot on one player. Instead we waited to FA and signed Hayward and used the assets on Irving. This made the math George or Butler vs Hayward and Irving. Despite the Kyrie and Hayward acquisitions not working that’s the right move.  Cousins would have cost Brown +. That’s a bad move.  AD costs you Tatum and then some and he made it pretty clear he wasn’t staying so I’m glad we didn’t do that either.  Kawhi was a miss  Harden remains to be seen
"The issue with that is that Harden is also a flat out better scorer than Irving.  So he should be a main scorer and frankly Irving should sacrifice the most of the lot.  He's by no means bad, but Harden is just flat out a lot better than Kyrie is."
"The need to “Sacrifice” is overblown. Even the most selfish players don’t take every shot. Honestly with Harden, KD and Irving, I’d be fine with any of them taking a shot or going ISO as long as they are not double teamed.   If double teamed then pass it out.   I’m sure Nets will be fine even with Kyrie coming back."
"Gee, I can't imagine why anyone would be worried about Kyrie Irving not showing up."
ESPN: James Harden said Kyrie Irving has no talent
"Seriously, since when is it a controversial opinion to think Kyrie Irving is a better player than Jrue Holiday? This sub is fucking nuts sometimes, lol."
Why would a ring with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving put James Harden over Wade. Why not just say he's better than Wade now if that is all it would take to convince you.
"Kyrie Irving on Kyrie: ""I know what type of player Kyrie is. He’s one of the best players to ever touch a basketball. It’s God-given, 6-foot 2-inch, and can basically do everything. For me, it’s not trying to compete with that. It’s allowing Kyrie to be the best Kyrie he can be."""
Kyrie Irving bought a house for George Floyd's family.     Discuss Below.
"Honest question - do the Nets even want Kyrie back that badly?  The only people that need to take 20+ shots a game for them are Durant and Harden, they have history and already complement and play well off of each other. Harden is as good of a “point guard” as any. Irving doesn’t bring anything defensively and I can’t imagine him wanting reduced minutes.  Kyrie coming back kind of seems like diminishing returns."
Eight years ago I told Kyrie Irving the earth wasn’t flat and he proceeded to attack me with a rack of baby back ribs. The sauce was terrible.
sounds like a great conspiracy theory but too many variables for him to know his actions would equate to that.   it seems like adding james harden was more of a move because they expect a team without kyrie irving and want to make moves to win NOW while the East is weak and they have the SLIM REAPER
"Because they can sign Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Lebron and get a top six pick in a stacked class?"
"Ernie: ""And *maybe* Kyrie Irving."" smh"
"they've had like one practice and are missing Kyrie Irving, a $35 million dollar player.  &amp;#x200B;  y'all have the same starting lineup you've had for forever, have way more chemistry, and ugpraded from Bledsoe to Jrue Holliday.  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis so bad in crunch time the play they drew up was hoping he could run in and get a putback off of a miss"
Now imagine adding Kyrie Irving to this...insane
"Landry Shamet is in his third season and has played with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden."
Jaylen Brown is who Kyrie Irving thinks he is.
"Wardell Stephen Curry II is past his prime. 4 regular season games against the Pistons, Bulls, Blazers and a Luke Walton coached team doesn’t change anything.   Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA right now. So many people in denial."
But he played well against the Blazers and a Luke Walton coached team.  Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.
Austin Rivers &gt; Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving isn’t selfish
"“I’m not Thales of Miletus, by no means,” Kyrie Irving scoffed at suggestions that he was brought to only be in a physiologoi role, vociferously denying he was the late inventor of the Flat Earth theory, according to NYTimes article describing his ontological stance on the matter."
"yea seriously.. TP was like kyrie irving before kyrie irving, his acrobatic finishing at the rim was insane and he actually won shit lol"
"Kyrie ""patient in my approach"" Irving"
"**Kyrie Irving** Secretary of ""Whatever-the-fuck-he-wants"""
"Well bs like ""Kyrie Irving missing a layup flipped Senate seat(s)"" is the type of stuff that when entertained or believed likely actually has a negative effect on American politics."
"Despite what I used to think, This confirms that Kyrie Irving is a misunderstood genius"
The only way 2020 could possibly end is with Kyrie Irving potentially saving American politics on the basketball court.

"I know people will focus on all the role players, lineup changes etc., but I have to say that Kyrie Irving was absolutely PHENOMENAL this game. He came out on fire(9-9 FG to start) and set the tone on BOTH ends of the floor. He showed truly leadership and lead from the front. He also set up team mates and was supportive of everyone. One of his best games as a Net."
"Correction: there is one reason, which is to prevent Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant from whining about their friend not getting enough minutes"
"Because it's just as ridiculous and insulting to suggest that it's black and white that one was the beneficiary of help while the other was the architect of their own success. Both are legendary players with incredible propaganda behind them and the beneficiaries of great FO (like literally all great players) yet people are trying to pretend they are any different in how they approached the game.  The way 2016 is talked about you'd think Lebron carried G Leaguers who shot 2% from 3 to the title and not had an incredible team loaded with shooters with an amazing scorer in Kyrie Irving who were favourites over literally the exact same team the year before. You'd really think Lebron was ""coming home"" rather than going to a team with 3 no.1 picks, 2 top players in Kevin Love and Kyrie guaranteed to join at the time, and a FO willing to do whatever it took to get the exact roster construction Lebron wanted.  The Heatles (along with the recent warriors teams) are literally the definition of stacking the deck as much as you can and yet the mental gymnastics people do to say Lebron didn't do anything remotely similar to what KD did are are frankly hilarious. The only major difference worth criticizing more for KD is one joined the team that beat him but in both cases the anticompetitive undertones of their moves are exactly the same. Yet they'll actually portray it in retrospect as if Lebron was ""wronged"" this whole time.  You'd really think the Lakers management didn't get him Anthony Davis, and pulled out ALL the stops to try and get fucking Kawhi to join them as well while loading the team with quality players championship calibre players like Gasol and Green. But sure, Lebron had ""no help"".  It's frankly insane, people here are complaining about how biased the last dance is, which it is of course, it's a) a documentary, and b) storytelling. They're all biased. But then turn around and preach about how Lebron always got the short end of the stick in his NBA career from roster construction and created his own success so much more than Jordan did. When the Lebron documentary inevitably drops, it will be just as biased.  Go on, downvote me. I have karma to spare. But deep down y'all know."
"Cavs have had a bunch of great point guards too:  * Kevin Johnson, no less * Mark Price * Terrell Brandon * Andre Miller * Kyrie Irving * World B. Free * Colius Sexland"

This Kyrie Irving fella is pretty good at basketball.
On days like this Kyrie Irving is a top 10-15 player in the NBA.
"Stockton is an above average defender but it isn’t like he’s All-Defense level bigger guards would give him trouble. Terry Porter absolutely abused him for example. Plus guard defense isn’t THAT important.   Lillard and Harden are much better players then Kyrie, that could change this season as Irving as looked good but that is to be soon.   Plus with other scorers I imagine Harden can adopt and me even more dangerous because he wouldn’t be constantly doubled"
Kyrie Irving giving us that MyCareer experience right now.
Kyrie fucking Irving

"Embarrassing takes. People really expect the Nets to have a hard time to make the NBA Finals?  You’re betting on Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Mike Budenholzer over Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in the playoffs?   Skip to the NBA Finals already."
"This isn't directed at your comment at all but I get a little annoyed how some on social media want to make it about who's better, Curry or Dame.   They are both elite talents and two of the best point guards today. There are some really great point guards in this league, CPIII is still great even if he's showing his age, Ja Morant a great guard of the future, Jamal Murray growing into a perennial all star, Westbrook still elite, Kyrie Irving still dances with the ball on string, De'Aaron is likely De'Fastest guard in the league today, Trae Young is looking like a really special talent, I enjoy watching these guys do the things they do on a basketball court."
Kyrie Irving. Pretty decent player not a lot of people have heard of.
"&gt; If Harden gets to Brooklyn, reportedly his top preference, would he give up shots and some control to mesh with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, two of the league’s most dominant scorers?  In Brooklyn, Kyrie should probably be the one giving up the most shots of the three.  Harden and KD should be sacrificing the least in my opinion.  Obviously everyone should sacrifice *some,* but I think it makes sense for Kyrie to sacrifice the most, as he's the worst player of the three by a good margin."
"I mean every team goes through turnover over a 2-3 year period. Here's some of the players the Celtics have lost since your championship run: Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Aron Baynes, and several other players that weren't starters but were part of the rotation."
"NBA Finals games and playoff games impress me more than regular season games.  Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the NBA Finals and there are better regular season players than him in the league.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving are better than Wardell Stephen Curry II. Two regular season games against the Blazers and Kings doesn’t change anything."
There has been some. In the last game Kyrie Irving called a timemout and Kd came over angry asking why he did that but Kyrie kept looking away from Kd.
Kyrie Irving  Jaylen Brown  Gordon Hayward  Jayson Tatum  Al Horford
"""It's okay. You had a good run. You had the last ten shots, the next 10 shots are mine"" - Kyrie Irving, approved by Patrick Beverley"
Going into the finals LeBron and Curry both were playing good basketball and it was close. Personally I would have put LeBron ahead of him because his defense was back to his near DPOY form but you can argue whichever way you like really.  In the 2016 finals though LeBron was easily the best player on the court and that’s where he separated himself from Curry.  Even the most deluded GSW homer wouldn’t argue that Curry was better in the finals.  LeBron literally led both teams in every statistical category while still being efficient. Kyrie Irving outplayed Curry across the board that year.  LeBron clearly being the best player on the court in that finals series while Curry couldn’t even be the 2nd best player on the court is what separates LeBron ahead of Curry to me in that year.  Curry is great and he’s an all-timer. He was never really better than LeBron tho unless you want to count 2015. But if you’re the type to make excuses for Draymond and Bogut’s absence in 2016 then you can probably understand the excuses for Kyrie and Love’s abscene in 2015.  Not being better than LeBron isn’t a bad thing. There’s only one maybe two other players that you can argue have ever been better than Lebron.
Kyrie Irving and Buddy Hield are the same age
I’d take current Kyrie Irving over both if I want to win a championship.   Wardell Stephen Curry II and Russell Westbrook suck in the NBA Finals.

"* Rui can guard KD surprisingly well. There's some shit that KD is just going to get away with because he is KD. But not bad at all.  * Brooklyn's approach to rebounding cost them. Washington had 13 offensive rebounds, 17 second-chance points. They keep rebounding to set-up the transition offense rather than just being fine with securing a rebound to set-up their half-court set.   * I don't know how Kyrie Irving is able to do as much as he does in a 24-second shot clock.  * Bertans really looks lost on the floor. I don't know what he did this offensive but he's misreading half court sets and is losing shots as a result.   * Beal good."

"How can we clown Kyrie Irving for saying he plays with a clutch player? He's talking about fucking Kevin Durant, it's just a true statement. Game winners are missed all the time."
"No it’s misquoted. He said “One thing I’ve always been comfortable with is, I’ve felt like I was the best option on every team I’ve played for down the stretch. This is the first time in my career where I can be like “that motherf***** can make that shot, too.” It’s not supposed to be a shot at lebron but praising durants shot making ability. Lebron is a better player than both them but what Irving is talking about is a specific ability to create jump-shots in typically one on one scenarios, like in this video. Lebron 90% of the time is driving because he’s a better, smarter basketball player. Irving and KD will keep doing this but find success, Lebron can do this too just not as well, (at this point in his career he’s probably on the same level though) so he just takes what the defense gives him will kyrie and KD like taking tough jumpers for game."
"Too bad both of them suck during the playoffs. Wardell Stephen Curry II is probably the worst NBA Finals performer of all time.  Kyrie Irving is better than both. He doesn’t choke when it matters, unlike the other two."
"*""One thing I've always been comfortable with is, I felt like I was the best option on every team I've played for down the stretch. This is the first time in my career where I can look down be like, that mother fucker can make that shot, too""*  - Kyrie Irving"
"&gt; For small players like Step who are skilled in shooting have difficulty carrying the team if shots are not falling.   Lmao this is the same kind of cliched criticism that's been used since 2015 and proven false over and over again. Steph impacts the game immensely without making his shots. He's one of the most efficient driving guards of all time, he has higher contested FG% at rim than Kyrie Irving. He's got an efficient midrange game and ball handling to pick his options."
Kyrie...Irving?
&gt; Kyrie Irving is a better offensive player than Wardell Stephen Curry II  &gt; I watch basketball games    You sure about that?
"Media personalities, but switch Kevin Durant and James Harden. Kyrie Irving is a better offensive player than Wardell Stephen Curry II too.   What an embarrassing post man. My opinion is not based on other people’s opinion. I watch basketball games and ignore the media clowns."
I’m more annoyed by the commentator calling him “Irving” instead of “Kyrie” more than anything else. It just sounds.. wrong.

"He's been broken since at least the halfway point of last season. He started off hot, feeling himself... playing like he's about to be KD, taking fade aways, crossovers, 3s, etc... then something happened and he stopped feeling himself and now can't even make anything, even his old go to bank shots around the basket. Before last season, he was getting baskets cutting, off of rebounds, fastbreak points... he played solid D... all that is gone with him focused on being Kyrie Irving, but he's not. He's fucking nervous, clumsy and can't pass out of a double to save his life.   Dude is broken. Worst part is that our team's system and chemistry seems to work with him off, because he keeps stopping the ball and failing when he's on, so not only does he fuck up, but our other players stop cutting, moving, trying...  Siakam seriously needs to go back to what he was good at, hustle, cutting, transition and D. The added 3pt shot is great, but he should be catch and shoot, not isoing. Our offense can't slow down for inefficient iso that leads to turnovers half the time. He's not a 1st option and we can't waste time or his talent on this pipe dream."
"Kyrie Irving and Paul George.  No matter what they say or do they’re getting hate.  Majority of it is not justified.  Out of the 1000s of things they say there are only a few comments that are particularly questionable.  So from these comments they are granted an unwarranted reputation.  People hang on to everything these nba players say.  The media and us to a certain extent, find a way to twist their words and make it into something it’s not"
"Kyrie Irving’s KAI Family Foundation has been particularly active during the COVID-19 pandemic. SInce March, Irving has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to food banks, hundreds of thousands of meals to hungry, thousands of pieces of personal protective equipment to his late mom’s Sioux nation in the Dakotas as well as $1.5 million to help those WNBA players who couldn’t participate in the Bradenton “wubble.”  He also has personally distributed Thanksgiving turkeys to disadvantaged families in his two New York area “hometowns,” one in New Jersey, the other in the Bronx.  Now, with the holiday season upon us, Irving has broadened his giving with his “11 Days of Giving,” As Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson reports Friday, the list is varied...  —Donating school supplies to 25 teenage girls in Kenya, Africa  —Donating 100 Book Bags to kids is Newark, NJ  —Donating money to Moms of Black Boys United for Social Change. In Brooklyn, N.Y.  And in the most dramatic move, Irving agreed to pay the tuition of nine students at Lincoln University, a historically black university in Pennsylvania."
Hawks fans might be more embarrassing than Warriors and Lakers fans.  Hawks fans need to chill out. Your favorite team won 20 games last season. Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the East too.

"Yeah, don't know why people use initials for guys who have the most unique name ever and are probably the top 1% of the league.      When you say LeBron or James, you know its lebron james. When you say Kyrie, you know its Kryie Irving, when you say KD, people know its Kraft Dinner. Like come on."
Kyrie Irving is better than anyone on the Celtics. Kevin Durant will most likely be the clear cut best player in a couple months.   Superstars win championships in the NBA. Celtics might be 5 years away.
"Wow you’re smarter than most people on this subreddit.  Kawhi Leonard is top 3 though. In what world are Luka Dončić, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Joel Embiid better than Kyrie Irving?  Decent list, but not perfect."
The worst case of this was when someone on First Take called Kyrie Irving “KI”. I forgot who but god it was so annoying to listen to
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would easily shoot at least 50/50/90 in the NBA Finals against the Lakers, especially with Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and Talen Horton-Tucker on the team.  As a Kevin Durant fan.... I would much rather face the Lakers than the Clippers in the Finals.  Nets in 4 against the Lakers."
I absolutely would not think of Kyrie Irving if someone said Ky.
Kyrie Irving is the best Australian player in the league and it’s not close.  Ben Simmons can’t shoot and will never make the Finals as a top 2 player on his team. Same applies to Giannis Antetokounmpo.
"I saw someone say something about KI a couple weeks ago, and I thought “who the fuck is that?” And he was talking about KYRIE IRVING! Like, made me feel like an idiot for no reason because no one in history has called Kyrie irving KI."

It’s close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."
"&gt;Dude are you really arguing Terry Rozier is better than Kyrie Irving?   Where in any of my comments did I say that, you troglodyte?   &gt;Chemistry was an issue the next year, but that year they were still in the honeymoon phase. Boston fans and the team still loved Kyrie in 17-18.  Ok... irrelevant to what we're talking about  &gt;Terry Rozier in the playoffs averages 9.8/4/3.3 on .393/.335/.809. Kyrie averages 23.5/3.3/5 on .453/.398/.879 in the playoffs. How are they even remotely comparable as players?  Never said Rozier was better, but that the fit was better. That's evident with the fact the Celtics had more wins in 2018 and went farther in the playoffs  You can be a worse player than another but be a better fit. Ben Simmons would be a better starting PG than Kentavius Caldwell-Pope, but he'd probably be a bit worse fit on the Lakers considering the way our lineup is built and our system is.  This point has been argued to the point of irrelevancy.  Trying to bait me into saying Rozier &gt; Kyrie, when I never even implied that, is an attempt to get me off topic. The 18 Celtics were better, full stop."

"Wardell Stephen Curry II, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Dončić are the overrated trio.  You know it’s bad because I didn’t include LeBron James. Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis and Trae Young are better players. The bias of the media is embarrassing."
Deadass lol. Acting like the year before they didn’t go against a team that was missing Kevin Love AND Kyrie Irving. Warriors fans are fucking ridiculous
"Wardell Stephen Curry II regressed since choking in the back to back Finals (2015 and 2016). Kevin Durant was carrying the Warriors and no one appreciated his skill when he was on the Warriors.  Kyrie Irving might be the best point guard in the NBA right now, but the media hates him.  Kyrie Irving needs to be clear cut better than every other point guard to get his respect. He’s going to show everyone in July.   Get the excuses ready for LeBron James and Wardell Stephen Curry II."

"There are examples of teams subtracting a higher production player due to poor fit and getting better even with lower production players. An example would be the 2008 and 2009 Nuggets. Chauncey for Iverson may not be the only reason the Nuggets got to the WCF, but the advanced stats say that Chauncey was a way better fit than AI for Melo. Memphis in 2013 also traded Rudy Gay for Tayshaun Prince and got better. From a team perspective, it's harder to replace what Dragic brought to the table for the Heat in 2020 than it was for the Cavs in 2015 for Kyrie. The other players are valid arguments because it represents how a team could compensate for the lost of player. LeBron evidently could compensate better for the loss of Irving than Butler could for Goran's absence. I'm not arguing that Irving is better than Dragic in a vacuum because he is, but if we're arguing what the impact of a loss is to the team then it's definitely a factor if a team could make up for lost production.  In the same vein as 2015 Thunder, the 2020 Warriors lost Steph and Klay to injuries and missed the playoffs. Jrue definitely had it worse than Dame, but there were injuries, nonetheless. I don't argue 2015 had it worse, but that it's not an extreme fluke as you're making it out to be. I mean to be fair, in every series both the Lakers and Warriors played it's valid to say that upsets would be more possible due to injuries. The Lakers had 2/4 series affected with significant injuries or illnesses (WB and Heat)  and 1/4 with a minor injury relative to situation (Dame), the Warriors I'd argue had 2/4 series affected with significant injuries (Pels and Cavs) and 2/4 with either injuries that didn't also last the entire series (Memphis) or an injury to a relatively less significant player (Beverley). The 2015 Warriors had it luckier, but it ain't that far.  And all I'm saying is that the 2016 Warriors were closer to the 1996 Bulls had they won, because the playoffs aren't the only thing that matters and considering the injury and suspension situations, 15-9 has a lot of context to it. But they didn't win, so it's really no contest."
Imagine caring about all-time lists....  LeBron James will probably finish his career having the most points all time even though Kevin Durant was a much better scorer and they played in the same era.   John Stockton all time leader in assists and steals... “he has to be a top 3 point guard of al time.” Embarrassing takes. I would rather have Kyrie Irving or Chris Paul than John Stockton.  Who cares? The NBA regular season is kind of a joke. 2/3 of all NBA teams make at least the play in game. You got Atlanta Hawks fans acting like they won the championship because they beat Kevin Durant in the regular season. Embarrassing.
"Andrew ""Markelle ""Kyrie Irving"" Fultz"" Wiggins"
Indeed it’s difficult. Kyrie Irving is better than James Harden for the exact reason you mentioned.
Kyrie Irving is unguardable. De’Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish didn’t lock him up. Embarrassing takes. Probably the same people that think Kevin Love locked up Wardell Stephen Curry II in the Finals.  Bad shooting night from Kyrie Irving.... it happens in the regular season. Thank god it doesn’t happen in the Finals like Wardell Stephen Curry II.
"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving  It’s 5 games into the season, he’ll find a middle ground as the season progresses"
"Westbrook is pretty popular and hasn’t missed an all star game since his injury season when KD was MVP, being an all star 9/10 years. Irving is a tough one too as the only time he’s missed it since his first one was when he was out through December in 15-16. Lowry hasn’t missed one since his first one.  Realistically there’s 2 spots for Westbrook, Beal (long shot imo), Brown, Kyrie, and Lowry. Trae and Simmons seem to be locks."
"&gt; a good example of how pro athletes are the exact opposite of the classic ""dumb jock"" stereotype; we have to give credit where credit is due. draymond is the perfect testament to that  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/draymond-green-defends-kyrie-irving-earth-may-be-flat"
Kyrie Irving: Bad defender  Joe Harris : terrible defender   KD: used to be okay. Slow as fuck these days  DeAndre: terrible against guards  Allen: overrated as hell   From top to bottom you guys are filled with horrible defenders. I can't name a single plus defender. Maybe Jeff Green? And he's like 40
"Correction, Kyrie Irving does not lose to Kyle Lowry with the second greatest player of all time next to him. And it's been quite some time since 2016 for Kawhi"
Kevin Durant doesn’t lose to Kawhi Leonard. Kyrie Irving doesn’t lose to Kyle Lowry.  Nets in 4.
Prime example: Kyrie Irving
I’d rather have Kyrie Irving than Wardell Stephen Curry II because he actually shows up in big games.
"His defense has been great this season. You don't watch our games, that much is clear. See [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/NekiasNBA/status/1344650282832158721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1344650282832158721%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netsdaily.com%2F2021%2F1%2F1%2F21180693%2Fbrooklyn-nets-atlanta-hawks-nba-game-preview-kyrie-irving-trae-young-new-years-day) thread for just a few examples"
I think you’re underrating how great Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving have been in the Finals. They show up in the Finals unlike Wardell Stephen Curry II.  LeBron James might end up scoring 8 points again and Anthony Davis might end up with 5 rebounds.  Nets in 4.
"this  also,   NO TEAM IS TRADING DOWN FROM 1  Cade is right there with Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving as far as 1st overall prospects go."
"Cade is an elite 1st overall prospect, think Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard  no team is trading that pick"
Yeah I thought so too but [this article popped up](https://brobible.com/sports/article/kyrie-irving-steve-nash-kevin-durant/) and I am pretty sure I already saw it on reddit a couple of hours ago.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavsnation.com/cavs-news-kyrie-irving-was-convinced-at-the-time-that-lebron-james-wanted-him-traded/amp/  Jackie McMullan   K bye, you aren’t worth another reply"
"Kawhi is too loveable in comparison. PG13 is still gonna get hate cus he bailed on two franchises and those teams are always entitled to their salt, but hes only getting hate when hes not producing in the playoffs.   Whereas you can hate Kyrie Irving year round."
"Only incompetent teams trade unprotected picks. The Clippers traded an unprotected pick to the Cavs in exchange for cap relief. The pick was projected to be the 8th pick of the draft, but instead the Cavs won the lottery and drafted Kyrie Irving. A few years later, Kyrie's presence on the team helped convince LeBron to return to Cleveland and help them win a championship."
Once I attend flat earth U I’ll finally understand the basics of Kyrie Irving lol
To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Kyrie Irving.
"&gt;Kyrie Irving publicly said his team didn’t need a head coach, decided to sit out the last few games because he didn’t feel like playing and didn’t give a reason, broke COVID protocol, communicated with nobody on his team  Got some things wrong here"
"Lol bro the Nets have no defense, no bench and Kyrie Irving is Kyrie Irving.  They have no money, and no draft picks."
&gt; it to see this 3 ring circus come about. &gt;  &gt; Irving doesn't like to play basketball. Durant is an iso master. Harden needs the ball in his hands with a 100% usage rate with the world revolving around him.  World can't revolve around Harden if its flat - Kyrie probably
"Kyrie ""~~second~~ third fiddle"" Irving. He's gonna love it."
"Fair point but they also have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving on their team."
man you sound as crazy as kyrie irving right now
I'm just curious to see how the league and the Nets handle this situation. I guess at this point if you're the Nets then you have to hope the Irving situation works itself out with this recent acquisition. And if nothing else you got Harden and KD so I guess that nullifies any possible disruption from Kyrie.
This is my first time seeing this and I don’t know anything about the trade. But if Houston got Kyrie Irving there screwed.
SB needs to do a collapse video on Kyrie Irving alone.
"Any Nets fan who isn’t a fan of this is out of their mind. You have three players that will give you 75+ points a night, and buyout guys come onto the market every year.  Who the fuck cares about 10 years from now, even if they win just 1 title from this, this trade is 1000% worth it.  If worst comes to worst and you want to blow it up, you have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving to trade. That’s pretty fucking solid. Just buy in now and pray for the best."
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
"Imagine thinking one of Kyrie Irving, James Harden or Kevin Durant won’t be at the court at all times excluding blowouts. Embarrassing.   You’re sleeping on Nicolas Claxton. Nets getting a DPE for Dinwiddie too?"
"Ya I think we can outscore Embiid with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden lol."
"You don’t just simply become “best friends” with Kyrie Irving, we’re not on his plane of existence"
"Yooo...If it's for Kyrie Irving, someone over on another thread hit the nail on the head. That Kyrie got a waft of the trade , and attempted to tank his trade value.    I like it IF they don't have to give up LaVert."
"This will not end well at all. It's not a super team really, its Durant and Harden (awesome) plus Kyrie (who will not be happy or effective) and a massive void on the defensive end. This would have been much better if a NJ could have gotten the Rockets to accept Irving and held onto Allen."
"No, the earth is also a flat circle   Cc: kyrie Irving"
"“Lol KD can’t win by himself”  Now that KD has one with James Harden and Kyrie Irving I believe KD can win by himself.   Good point, sort of hilarious logic behind that one."
"Who had Steve Nash leading Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and James Harden to a championship run on their 2021 bingo card?   Anyone?"
"All I know is James Harden, Kevin Durant and 45% of Kyrie Irving are on one team"
"I cannot believe Brooklyn has Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving LOL imagine telling a Nets fan this would happen even three years ago"
"Honestly, fuck Kyrie Irving. They had a legit championship team, and he just fucked all these hard working guys out of that, and he's getting rewarded with a possible dynasty."
"Mental health issues are no excuse for repeatedly bad behavior. Either have the self awareness to seek help and address your issues, or deal with the consequences. Irving is dealing with the consequences. Criticizing his behavior is absolutely appropriate in my eyes, and like millions of others, I have mental health issues as well, but know when to take responsibility for my actions that result. Why can't Kyrie?"
Kyrie Irving... The Kanye West of basketball!
@wojespn: “Kyrie Irving has been moved to active for tonight’s Nets game.”
Caris Levert is dope. Nobody wants a Kyrie Irving who doesn’t wanna play
So Nets lineup once/if Kai Irving returns is Kyrie/Harden/Harris/KD/DJ with Green/Shamet/TLC/Prince as bench pieces. Not too bad on paper
"Oh fuck.  I'm going to hate this, aren't I?  I swear to fuck if we just got Kyrie *Goddamn* Flat Earth Irving I'm going to flip."
"James ""Cheeseburger"" Harden joins Kyrie ""Doesn't wanna play"" Irving and Kevin ""Tweets himself"" Durant; my guess is this will work out fine..."
CAN I ASK DR KYRIE ANDREW IRVING IF HE PLANS TO SHOW UP TO WORK IN HOUSTON TEXAS???????
He’s Vice President of the players association. I don’t see this mentioned enough in this nonsensical melodrama.   &gt; This was the right time for me to run for a leadership position in the NBPA  -Kyrie Irving.
"when you factor in everything that comes to winning team basketball games, Kyrie isnt top 5, top 10, probably not even top 15.   Theres a legit argument that he is a net negative asset. Call me a biased Raps fan, but I take Lowry over Irving 100% of the time, and I would bet you good money a lot of GMs would do the same"
"Kai Irving, he's really good friends with Kyrie Irving"
The best friends name was probably Kyrie Irving.
"Harden is on a rebuilding team.  Irving is on a team that with him, is considered a Finals favorite. It's a weird scenario where a contending team would be most likely to trade for Kyrie. The odd piece being the Nets have plenty of depth, and would probably want a star back.  Who the fuck is giving their star up for Kyrie right now?"
“Kyrie Irving has not been playing and the Brooklyn Nets are trying to find out why.”
“James Harden and Kyrie Irving are both All-Star Guards in our League.”
James Harden and Kyrie Irving are both NBA players! - Magic
Kyrie plus a shit ton of picks. I think this is just Brooklyn announcing that Irving is now available.
"Yeah the teammates are pretty much my only general concern in those situation. I don't know whats going on behind the curtains, but I think you have to stay professional to your teammates. Same with the Kyrie Irving situation. I'm fine with whatsever going on there, honestly I don't even know whats happening, but as soon as one of the other Nets will complain about the drama, I might jump the ship with Kyrie."
Fuck Kyrie Irving
They start with Harden Claus and end up with the Kyrie Irving Clause
Volume stats can only take you so far and I'm not disputing that Harden is a better player than Kyrie Irving.  Harden can have a monster game 1-4 and then put up poor performances in the next few games and still have good stats. We've seen him constantly have his worst games in the close-out games that matter in the playoffs.  Kyrie's offense is completely fluid based on what the defense throws at him. I value his offensive arsenal in the playoffs more than Harden's.
Kyrie 'Deshaun Watson' Irving
"&gt;""**I just think the material gain in it just doesn't really matter to me anymore as much as it once did.** The little things are just what make the game special. Coming every single day and playing with these guys, and still try to figure out what that challenge is, to be better as a basketball player rather than like, 'What's my popularity like?' or 'What branding could be done here?' or something like that. That all comes, but I think the love of the game should always outshine everything else that comes with the NBA lifestyle."" [Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25355510/boston-celtics-guard-kyrie-irving-says-hoping-mid-30s-retirement)  That was from 2+ years ago, but he's been very outspoken about retiring earlier than most of his colleagues. ([Here's another article from the end of the Cavs days where he talked about it too.](https://kingjamesgospel.com/2017/05/18/cleveland-cavaliers-kyrie-irving-early-retirement/))  I mean, I agree with you $70M is a fuckton of money, but if anybody would be willing to just walk away from that it would be Kyrie."
"I'm sorry, but Kyrie Irving is no Kobe Bryant."
"Kyrie Irving isn’t gonna retire and forfeit $100 million plus that is owed to him the next 3 years. If he’s gonna retire early, it’ll be after this contract."
This is the real reason why Kyrie doesn’t want to play.  Kyrie: We have to be on the same page like Bron and AD to win a championship.  KD: I agree.  Kyrie: Do you think that the earth is flat?  KD: No  Few days later...  Nets: Kyrie Irving will not play due to personal reasons.
Houston legend Kyrie Irving.
This is the real reason.  Kyrie: We have to be on the same page like Bron and AD to win a championship.  KD: I agree.  Kyrie: Do you think that the earth is flat?  KD: No  Few days later...  Nets: Kyrie Irving will not play due to personal reasons.
"Let me tell you something. If the Rockets end this messy divorce with: Christian Wood, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Caris Levert, Jarret Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie and 5 picks, they would have done a damn good job.  I do not think that is the deal, but even if it ends up being Kyrie and a broken Dinwidde + STILL all those picks? WORTH IT."
Imagine telling someone in 2017 that Kyrie Irving would make Kevin Durant look like a hero in just a few years
Kyrie Irving took his ball and went home
"People are upset for various reasons. One of them is like you said a grown man being able to do what he wants while dealing with issues. The average person can't just not show up to work, ESPECIALLY without telling anyone why, unless it's a very extreme circumstance (like a death in the family). If the average person just didn't show up to work for multiple days in a row for ""personal reasons"" but then was caught partying and going to unrelated meetings, then they would get fired. So some people are mad that he gets to be in a place of privilege to not fulfill his contract/job obligations. Another one is because he's an entertainer working for an entertainment organization. Some people watch the NBA for Kyrie Irving, and others just love watching him play. He's not playing, so obviously fans can't watch him, which is upsetting to people that paid money to buy his jersey, his shoes, or even those who just take time out of their day to watch basketball and see Kyrie play. The last reason I can think of (and the only one that really upsets me) is that Kyrie is going out during a pandemic and partying. People who do that are just going around spreading COVID and some people haven't done much other than be at home or go to work for the past 10 months. He might be a grown man but it's extremely selfish to be going out during these times and it rubs people who have been taking this seriously the wrong way.   I'm sorry for the essay but I just wanted to give you more of an idea why people are mad. He's a public figure and he knew what he was getting into when he chose to play in the NBA, so he's not getting any sympathy from me"
The nets are gonna have a hard time trading kyrie Irving cause he legally changed his name to kai irving
"We're about to get the ""Kyrie Irving Clause"""
"I feel like New York is still a team that would take a chance on Kyrie. What about something like this?:  * HOU receives: Caris LeVert, Julius Randle, Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, Brazdeikis, BKN 2021 1st Rounder, BKN 2023 1st Rounder, BKN 2025 1st Rounder, 2022 Pick Swap with BKN, 2024 Pick Swap with BKN, NYK 2021 1st Rounder  * BKN receives: James Harden, PJ Tucker  * NYK receives: Kyrie Irving  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y4ye7wuc  Brooklyn doesn't completely gut their roster and retains depth but they have no draft picks to trade for 5 years. New York gets a top 8 PG (when he plays) without giving up a core piece like RJ or Robinson. Houston gets younger good upside players who can contribute immediately or can be flipped for more picks.   Thoughts?"

"Wtf are you guys talking about? I saw the screenshot of the Zoom meeting, that was KAI Irving, not Kyrie.  I swear the media is just out to get him."
"sorry boo i did mention specifically that ""us mere mortals"" bit. I know we dont compare to your lord kyrie ""woke no mask"" irving."
Kyrie Irving is acting like a spoiled asshole. Chuck might be right about nobody telling this kid how to behave his entire life.
SAS is simply piggybacking on Kyrie’s own comments about retiring [young](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2018/11/23/kyrie-irving-retirement-age).
Man it’s just really interesting to see how responses talking about how this outrage is getting ridiculous get downvoted. Basically screams “THIS IS A KYRIE IRVING HATE THREAD”
Kyrie Irving
"It's a terrible look to trade a guy like Irving if he didn't ask for it or go AWOL like he did now. Kyrie was playing extremely well too, doesn't make much sense to just ship him off because Harden is better. I don't Durant was ok with it back then too."
"If him and durant are healthy and playing they have good chance of coming out of the east,come on it is kyrie irving and kevin durant they both can average 25-30 ppg in a playoff series.   So no, i dont think the reason he ghost them is because he thinks his team doesnt have any chance to win"
"Kyrie Irving has perfected the tanking of trade value play-style that James Harden used to have with John Wall. It's even better that he doesn't have similar problems in the media that James Harden had.  We thought James Harden was the pinnacle for dropping trade value but Kyrie Irving is rewriting history. John Wall and the rest of the staff are probably super jealous of the coaching staff behind Brooklyn because this team is going to even greater heights."""
"Kyrie ""Antonio Brown"" Irving lol"
"As a mere media member, what right does SAS have to talk down on Kyrie Irving? Smh"
I don’t know why the Rockets would even bother trading for Irving at this point. He’s a worse player who already isn’t showing up for games on a team with two of his best friends on it.   The Nets would have to attach a bunch of picks of something for it to make any sense. No way Kyrie just shows up in Houston and starts playing
"&gt;You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at Steph and you look at Kevin Durant and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another shooter, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But Steph’s a genetic freak and he’s not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, to beat him. Then you add Kyrie Irving to the mix, your chances of winning drastically go down. See the 3 way, at 3pt shooting, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but Steph, Steph’s got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because after Kyrie refused to show up to Nets game, he KNOWS he can't beat Steph and he's not even gonna try!  &gt;So Kevin Durant, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus Stephs 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at 3pt shooting. But then you take his 75% chance of winning, if he was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, Stephs got 141 2/3 chance of winning at basketball. See Durant, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for the Nets at the finals.  -Lebron James, probably"
"No, we will never see Kyrie Irving play in the NBA again"
"""what are you gunna do about it bitch""   -Kyrie Irving  Nets won't do a goddamn thing lol"
"Meanwhile, James Harden and Kyrie Irving..."
At this point I think the Nets have at least approached KD about this. I am sure KD has to be somewhat concerned and doesn't want this translating into the post season. Honestly I could see Kyrie retiring that is how unpredictable he is so what is Irving value?
"Kyrie ""don't fucking mute my zoom call"" Irving"
Kyrie Andrew Irving Irving
"Lebron's second cleveland era made lebron a true leader. After dealing with too many weirdos, he totally learned to control all people near him. JR Smith, Kyrie Irving, Iman Shumpert, Kevin Love, and many who came and gone. Man, it should be too easy to play with an ambitious schröeder now."
"So, your real issue is, Kyrie is rich, you are not, and he is doing things you can't do? I don't get the point of bringing up his salary. Strip him of every dollar, and he is still Kyrie Irving - but you are saying you won't have a problem with him as much, then, because he would be broke? You know there are people from third world countries who consider 1st world citizens spoiled, wasteful, and lazy? The same way you look at Kyrie's behavior relative to his income level, someone is doing the same to you. Income doesn't change character, though. The same personality and character flaws Kyrie has, someone won't make 1/10th of that in their lifetime, has those same flaws. Money isn't a cure-all, but people that don't have it seem to think it should fix character issues. Nope, Kyrie is no different than the people who have a lot less than he does; he just have more money than they do. Nothing more or less."
"Kyrie Irving is black, where did I call Linda sarsour black?  Kyrie Irving is hanging around with anti semites. Connect the dots."
"Awesome intentional misinterpretation.  Kyrie Irving is black, and he's hanging around anti-semites. Connect the dots, asshole."
Bro it’s kyrie Irving I would not be surprised if he didn’t tell Durant lol
"Kyrie ""I just dont want to play"" Irving"
"If he stops playing, he'll be former NBA superstar Kyrie Irving. There won't be any reason for people to stop paying attention lol.   Also, he hasn't brought up anything related to the flat earth shit in years. And I'm pretty sure the last time he did, he apologized for it."
Also who the fuck in their right mind would want Kyrie Flat Earth Fake Dumbass Philosopher Irving spewing his bullshit on a zoom call on important social awareness topics. I’d rather listen to more coherent people talk on the matter and maybe Kyrie can donate some money instead
"&gt; Get caught on a social justice zoom call. Change that narrative as best you can  The dude is pretty big on the activism front.  It's not particularly hard to believe that the whole capitol shit really upset him since that was when he started.   Sorry I mistyped, kyrie Irving is crazy"
"Kyrie irving is the kanye west of the nba.  Thinks he's better than he is,  bat shit crazy and dumb as a mother fuck!"
"Kyrie Irving is a diva who has little interest in basketball.  I don't remember who mentioned the Stephon Marbury effect during the off-season, but it's quite that unfortunately for Kevin Durant and the Nets."
"While I get that sentiment. It’s kyrie Irving, one of the best, and on the nets side they’d have dead cap and guarantees to pay him. Firing him isn’t really an option"

"&gt; If you keep thinking your window is later you’re gonna reach a point where Tatum and browns deals are gonna be up and it’s not a lock the resign.   Our window isn't now because Tatum and Brown aren't good enough as players yet.   All you dumb Nets and Lakers fans who have an agenda against the Celtics like to create this faux state of urgency for the Celtics, when, if you actually fucking watched a Celtics game, you'd know that both players have a LONG way to go as players if they want to compete for a championship if they are the best players on the team. Neither of them know how to make anybody on their team better.   &gt; People aren’t clowning you for not trading for jrue they’re clowning you guys for having the best draft capital haul in history and not making a title contender with it  The 2018-19 Celtics had a starting 5 of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and a bench of Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes.   That was the best 9-man rotation anybody in the NBA had that year. Vegas had us as favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference.   Not Danny Ainge's fault that Gordon Hayward was a shell of himself after he broke his fucking leg and couldn't be the 2nd best player on the team like he was supposed to be."
"Ask every GM who would you rather have in the Playoffs between Irving, Beal &amp; George. I bet my life Kyrie is the overwhelming choice to that answer."
"IT chose to play through whatever pain he was feeling because it helped him cope with his sister. He was also traded for kyrie fucking irving which means he was on the finals team that year. Hardly an insult, IT also says he would love for a chance to play in boston again and holds no hard feelings about what happened"

"Kyrie makes $33,329,100, where Steph makes $43,006,362.  The most Brooklyn could acquire while sending out just Irving is $38,428,465, so no they could not acquire Curry for just Irving."

Ok lmao. Kyrie Irving is a top 5 player in the league by your shit judgement skills
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"He’s actually a pretty normal dude. My sister had her 21st birthday at a popular karaoke bar in Los Angeles, and we had a big group. I was set to go last, but as I was walking to the stage, a man in a hooded sweatshirt and hat asked if he could perform. I absolutely hate singing, so I was happy to oblige. For the next 15 minutes, Kyrie Irving performed poetry slam about the the government using birds as a means of controlling society. Everyone in the venue was so moved, my sister’s boyfriend captured a pigeon outside, and Kyrie decapitated it on stage."

"First off, Kyrie Irving is very much alive. Secondly, the number of beers is actually highly disputed."
Celtics: Trade their most beloved player for Kyrie Irving and get them to championship status  Fans: I can't believe Ainge would do that to his team and his most loyal player  Celtics: Don't trade Brown and Tatum trusting their potential as 22 and 23 year olds  Fans: AINGE WONT DO ENOUGH TO GET US TO THE TOP  Y'all need to stfu and pick a god damn lane. We played damn good basketball in the bubble and the Heat hit insane clutch shots to beat us in 6 games. We've been minutes away from the Finals if it weren't for the greatest player of this generation. Year after year we compete and play fun basketball. The fuck more do y'all want when we're right there duking it out for the top and are minutes away
"First of all ""didn't trade for any of the major stars""- see Kyrie Irving.  2nd of all OK by your measuring Rob Pelinka, Michael Winger are better than Morey, Presti and Ainge?"
Kyrie Irving did it last week!
"I think a few of them could end up better than LaMelo. It's considered a strong draft. But you don't know which ones, and the Minny pick is #4 or #5 at best. And LaMelo is probably going to be pretty good, I wouldn't bank on anyone being *that* much better.   Like in 2012, would you rather have the #4 pick in the draft, or a promising ROY (Kyrie Irving)?   Maybe that #4 pick turns into Lillard, who is arguably slightly more valuable than Kyrie - but just as likely to be Dion Waiters or Thomas Robinson."
"Of the top 7 players on this team in minutes (Harris, Irving, Harden, Green, Jordan, Brown, and Durant), the lowest TS% among them is Kyrie... AT 61.7%!!! The team as a whole shoots 61.5% TS which I'm fairly certain is a record without having to look it up."

"**TEAM KD RETURNS TO WASHINGTON**  Flash back to 2016. Fans of the Washington Wizards rejoice as hometown hero Kevin Durant announces that he's taking his talents to D.C. to rejoin his old coach Scottie Brooks (recently hired). Immediately, many peg the group as a true contender despite only finishing 41-41 the season before.  The Wizards start a little rockier than some expected, given the youth on the roster. After all, Beal (23 years old) and Bogdanovic (year 3 year in NBA) have not fulfilled their full potential yet.  At the same time, the overwhelming talent of prime John Wall and Kevin Durant proves to be difficult for the league to handle. Wall takes charge as an alpha dog leader and attack dog in transition, showcasing his underrated vision and passing ability. KD passively aggressively snipes to the media that Wall is the ""best PG he's ever played with,"" leading to a surly Westbrook press conference the next day.  Overall, it's hard to argue with the results. Durant helps lead the team to an immediate +15 game turnaround (going 56-26), winning MVP honors in the process. Wall leads the league in assists (11.1) and earns 2nd team All-NBA honors.  Of course, the true test comes in the playoffs and -- more specifically -- the Eastern Conference Finals where Durant matches up with rival LeBron James (still on Cleveland.) The series is an instant classic, with KD and LeBron trading punches, and sidekicks Wall and Kyrie Irving having their own big games here and there. The teams head into Game 7, deadlocked at 3-3.  In that final game, it turns out to be Kevin Love who provides the difference. Love catches fire and hits 5-7 threes, leading to a 26 point barrage that helps the Cavs slip by and head to the Finals once again.  The Wizards go home disappointed, but hopeful that they can be right back in the title mix as Bradley Beal continues his ascent."

"thank you for posting this. I’ve been trying to point this out and nobody will fucking listen. Saying a slur is awful, posting about and supporting people that think Jews are some thieves of heritage and not the real victims is just as bad. Fuck Kyrie Irving"
"Would he slap Durant and Kyrie Irving for declaring this is right?    &gt;Former NBA player Stephen Jackson made anti-Semitic remarks Wednesday while continuing to defend Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who apologized Tuesday for anti-Semitic social media posts he shared over the weekend.   In an exchange Wednesday with another Instagram Live user, Stephen Jackson said: “The Jews are the richest. You know who the Rothschilds are? … They control all the banks. They own all the banks.”  .....  &gt; DeSean Jackson appeared to be making a similar claim in his posts. He shared a passage from a book containing a quote, incorrectly attributed to Adolf Hitler, stating that “the white Jews knows that the Negroes are the real Children of Israel,” that Jews “will extort America” and that “their plan for world domination won’t work if the Negroes know who they were.”  ......  &gt; While the 33-year-old wide receiver followed that with a pair of public apologies, Stephen Jackson took to social media Tuesday to assert that DeSean Jackson had been “speaking the truth.”  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/08/stephen-jackson-says-desean-jackson-is-speaking-truth-adds-anti-semitic-claims-his-own/%3foutputType=amp"
"So when a bench riding nobody says a slur on a relatively obscure twitch stream it's the talk of the town but when NBA champion all star Kyrie Irving is actively promoting anti semitism to his Twitter followers, we're gonna just let that go, huh? Cool. Leonard is an idiot for this and deserves his punishment but what he did is minuscule compared to the NOI Farrakhan bullshit being pushed by everyone's favorite ""woke"" superstar."
"I didn’t realize I was talking tough?   And, I did. I provided Google.com. Those of you that know how to use your thumbs and are truly interested can easily type in Kyrie Irving Anti-Semite and enjoy some good reading.   I’m sure you’ll go into it with an open mind."
Kyrie Irving? I'm really not sure why this kind of reaction from the league shouldn't come back again on his comments
"Cool, now do Kyrie Irving."
"I mean, Dame has done it tho, along with Klay Thomson, Dirk, Kemba, Brad Beal, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, etc.  Not quite the same as the dunk contest.  And a lot of times the best 3 point shooters are more role type players anyway.  I'd say vet players just tend to avoid entering, but I do agree Steph is build differently and would probably compete in it when he's 40."
"I’ll say this, I believe Kyrie is a better non first option than Paul is. He’s 8th in the league in scoring with 2 top 5 players on his team, he’s more clutch, a better finisher, goat handles, and despite belief otherwise I think Kyrie is a very good passer. If Paul George is the main star I’ll take him because he’s the better leader and has proven he can string up a MVP level season with elite defense. However the fact Kyrie can play with KD and Harden and constantly not get out shadowed does it for me, and I feel the Clippers just get better with Kyrie instead of Paul.   Paul George is the more complete player but I want Irving."
"One team also has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Joe  Harris, the rockets Have Christian Wood."

Kyrie Irving
"Kyrie Irving watching it in the chat ""Fuck yeah bro I agree"""
Kyrie Irving
"They support people that do, Kyrie irving tweeted similar"
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
"Not only this, but the beginnings of what is now the National Basketball Association have roots in Jewish immigrant America.  Doing a cursory glance of many players from the early years there was a profound jewish influence.  While Kyrie Irving and the flat earth society may say the NBA was started by black kings it would be more fair to say it was started by some Melechs"
I just don't think the league should be involved in non-basketball related offences unless it's explicit calls for violence. I don't want a situation where a week before the finals kyrie irving says something like the US military is a bunch of terrorists and gets suspended for a game
And people that kneel such as Kyrie irving are racist themselves. Just ban both of them from the league.
He and Kyrie Irving can crack these jokes together.
"How about Kyrie Irving, that would be a start"
*Kyrie Irving is on another plane right now. Please try again in another celestial age.*
"beal sounds smart. i wish the media gave him as much attention as kyrie ""2D brain"" irving"
"Just learned about this ""movement"" Kyrie Irving is leading and have some viewpoints on it that might (probably) align with others, so I'm sorry if this is a redundant statement.      The tag line that caught my eye was "" [**KYRIE IRVING DEMANDS NBA TO CHANGE ITS LOGO: 'BLACK KINGS BUILT THE LEAGUE'**](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kyrie-irving-nba-change-logo-black-kings-built-the-league) ""     I don't necessarily agree with this (completely). There have been many upon many African American players to have change the game from time to time, that we know as a fact. BUT there are also Caucasian players to have changed the league as well. Now I know that might sound like ""White Privilege"" but I don't think it is. Granted there are more African American than Caucasian players to change the way things are done so I definitely think there is merit to celebrate Black culture more but Kryrie's demands are unwarranted.      Kyrie wanted to use a proposed logo with Kobe on the front. Why? because he's deceased? Kobe was a great player no doubt, but so was Lebron, MJ, Steph Curry, Vince Carter, Wilt Chamberlain. (the list goes on). I know Jerry West doesn't want to be on the logo any longer, but I think the NBA should go more along the route of the NHL or NFL with not having a silhouette in their logo. OR if they still want to keep the overall logo, make the silhouette more like the MLB's logo in which you cant tell who it is. (more generic of a man)"
yet they traded that washed version of Baron Davis and got a pick that turned into kyrie fucking irving
"Yeah, I don't think you're comprehending..   I'm saying that Lebron's voice has weight and people trust him.  People take a lot from these stars.  Kyrie [literally apologized](https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/10/1/17925768/kyrie-irving-apology-flat-earth-theory-celtics) to science teachers cause their students were believing the earth was flat, because of what he says on social media.   Can you find me a single instance of Kyrie directly telling people have to believe the earth is flat? Of course not, but people listen and admire players.   A lot of young people are doubting the vaccine's safety . A lot of old people too. Lebron being non-committal has an effect.   He can totally stay that way, but if he were to come out and provide good information, it could help a lot of people.  All I'm saying."
"Idk why, but ""and Kyrie Irving"" is hilarious."
What if Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward never got injured in 2018?
"Like I said even if you don't use the metric of everything going the same way, the other team has Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with nearly two minutes left in the game I'm sure they could find a bucket in that amount of time after the tension of nobody scoring had been broken, now had the block happened with 50 seconds left instead of a minute 50, I'd probably give it a little more credit, the way things stand now it was just a really pretty moment that's been drastically overrated"
Bro KD leaves Superteam to prove haters wrong and then Nets become another Superteam with solid veterans and 2 MVP caliber players where Kyrie Irving is your 3rd option. Jesus Christ the haters are gonna pounce so hard if whether they win or lose.
"If the game plays out exactly the same Golden State doesn't score another point after the layup, Kyrie hits the 3-pointer and LeBron hits the free-throw after the Draymond foul so yes Cleveland would still win using the exact same way it plays out oh, now if you want to make the case that the layup would have broken the monotony of neither team being able to score the other team has Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love with nearly two minutes left in the game I'm sure they can find a few buckets lol"
Why does KD always ask for so much help? Was Kyrie Irving not enough?
"You watched this game and came out feeling that Embiid alone is enough to win a series against Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin fucking Durant?"
Yes it's very worrisome that there's a team with Kevin Durant and James Harden and Kyrie Irving on it. Thank you for asking.

"&gt;I’m not quite sure you know what those stats mean since you just listed them off with no analysis.  You chirped at me, ""do you not follow the nba?"" and you don't know what ""+/- per 100"" means??  Are you trolling me?  And this whole exchange is analyzing him.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Nets didn’t do well?? He played 7 games (way too small of a sample size) on the nets and shot 50/40/90 before harden. And now he’s undoubtedly having the best season of his career. Very confused about this?  He played last year too, not most of the season but a good chunk.  And he's historically been an injury liability, so it's absolutely fair to factor that in.  And neither his box stats or the advanced metrics of +/- per 100 or RPM show that this season is especially different.  His box stats are slightly better in some areas, slightly worse in others, even if comparing to Celtics seasons.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Show me one source that said the nets wanted to get rid of kyrie in the harden trade.

You're calling me biased, while saying a dude that at his top is maybe 10th best in the league, is frequently injured, and is a certified knucklehead as a leader and off the court deserves a max contract -- all of which show up in his teams historically doing good but not great, when he hasn't played alongside one of the game's all-time best players in their prime. ""The proof is in the pudding.""  If he had the durability of prime LeBron or Harden, I'd say he'd deserve a max contract.  I'd also say the same if he had the intangibles of LeBron or prime Steve Nash, which would show up favorably in the W-L columns."
Kyrie Irving
Wait what?!? Kyrie Irving is playing??? Must be a misprint.
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"

But would winning a ring or two with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving add that much to his all-time ranking?
How would that disqualify wade? He won his first ring without a superteam. Hardens only ring is gonna be with Kevin Durant and kyrie irving. Harden bitched out he had a good squad in Houston before he forced a trade for Westbrick and then golden state broke up. They’d be underdogs vs the lakers but not horrible underdogs.
"Give me Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden"
With Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving? Harden looks like a bit of a fool now with how cp3 has held up. He couldn’t man up and get his shit together and stick it out with cp3 and instead forced a trade for westbrick and then dipped and went to create a superteam. Cp3 was willing to stick it out with harden and now has led okc to the playoffs and is helping lead Phx to a 2 seed.
"James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving"
Jaylen is who Kyrie Irving thinks he is.

"Well that’s the point. When Russ did it during his mvp season it was impressive because he was doing it while playing at a top 5 level. Now he’s doing it while not even being a top 25 player in a fast paced league. You compare him to magic and Oscar, the big difference was those guys consistently led those teams to huge offensive heights, something Westbrook has never done by himself even as well as someone like harden.   The point is that Westbrook here is acting like this makes him a good player. It doesn’t, getting 10 rebounds doesn’t make you better than Damian lillard or kyrie Irving. Doesn’t even make you better than a guy like jrue who can be a difference maker defensively and space the floor. It might not even make you better than a guy like Fred van vleet.   Getting triple doubles when you use most of your teams possessions and are horribly inefficient isn’t that impressive."
"I agree, you'd see players like Lebron and CP3 are probably the most efficient offensive players in totality but people tend to think scorers like Curry and KD are the hallmarks of efficiency because of their shooting, which obviously they are.    But a player like Kyle Lowry compared to a player like Kyrie Irving would be more interesting if there was a more all-encompassing stat."
Uhhh... did you forget Kyrie Irving is on that team?  Truth to be told he’ll probably show up at the reunion and argue the universe is a trapezoid
"Probably Klay Thompson, before the injuries of course, I don't like a shit ton of attention on me, but I am competitive and I do like to win, I also like engaging an herbal medication and fucking Instagram hoes while contributing valuably to my team's Championship success over the years, I'm pretty chill and laid back as well            Now I answered the question based on who I kind of relate to I guess, but if there was a time limit on this hopefully and it was just like a 2-day trial run, give me Kyrie Irving I got to see this dude's fucking thought process lol"
"&gt;**They could have** a starting line up with Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, and Kevin Durant   But they wouldn't"
"I hate to entertain this post but you forgot Colin Sexton. He was selected with one of Nets picks. To go back even further, we traded the 6th pick for Gerald Wallace. 6th pick turned into Damian Lillard.   So really its:  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, and Colin Sexton"
"When facing the hoop: Kyrie Irving or Steph Curry  When back to the hoop: Jayson Tatum, Demar Derozan"
"Cuz apparently dude had to deal with Kyrie ""look into the pinwheel with your 3rd eye"" Irving and a literal manchild in Kevin Love"
Who tf praises Lebron for that lol? Give me Kyrie Irving on my team next to Giannis any day of the downside is an occasional mood swing
Kyrie Irving. Don’t ask me why. He’s the real MVP
Kevin Love is what people think Kyrie Irving except without the talent
Imagine comparing Kyrie Irving to Ben Simmons. Absolutely disrespectful to Kyrie
"I somewhat agree but it’s a really complex issue.   Hypothetically, let’s imagine there are two of the exact same play with a different offensive player.  Imagine the defence applies the exact same contact on each play.   Player 1 Kyrie Irving drives gets the contact and falls to the ground - ref calls foul, no complaints   Player 2 Ben Simmons drives gets the contact doesn’t fall to the ground - ref calls no foul.   Do you believe a foul should be determined by the level of contact by the defender (which would mean both players should have a foul called) or should it be determined by how much the contact effects the offensive player (player 1 gets the call, player 2 does not.   I’d be interested to know what everyone thinks."

"here's the really interesting counter-factual: what if the Celtics had never made the Kyrie Irving trade at all?  They'd have gone into the 2017-2018 NBA season with IT/Rozier/Smart/Jaylen/Tatum/Hayward/Horford along with the Nets pick still.  Now fast forward to the offseason prior to the 2018 draft, the Celtics could've made a godfather offer to the Kings of Rozier, Nets Pick, Kings Pick + Grizzlies pick for De'Aaron Fox, giving the Celtics a core of Fox + the Jays + Smart + Timelord.  Alternatively, if the Kings say no then the Celtics just take SGA with the last Nets pick."
I'm more worried about getting the kyrie irving government question answered lol
How was Kyrie Irving as a teammate?
Kyries is way more controlled. This guy just moves his body cause he can.  Kinda like a Derrick Rose Kyrie Irving mixture
That’s not how basketball works at all lmao. The Lakers won’t get swept or anything but they’re pretty heavily outmatched against a full strength Nets team. We’re talking about two of the ten greatest offensive players ever and the best version of Kyrie Irving we’ve ever seen.
"Gotta love this level of denial lmao. Yeah bro, the Nets would be just as good with Kyle Korver out there instead of Kyrie Irving LMAO."
The Nets will have 2/3 best players in the series and Kyrie Irving is immensely better than anyone else on the Lakers roster
"Lebron James stats in the clutch: 4.4 points, 47.6% FG%, 39% 3PT%, 37.5% FT% (yikes)  Kyrie Irving stats in the clutch: 3.7 points, 47.5% FG%, 44% 3PT%, 88% FT%  Kevin Durant stats in the clutch: 4.3 points, 53.6% FG%, 40% 3PT%, 84.6% FT%  Lebron is definitely clutch outside of shooting free throws"
"It’s crazy to think that, as good as the Warriors were, it took either the absence of Kevin Love *and* Kyrie Irving, or the *addition* of Durant to the greatest regular season team in the history of professional sports in order to win."

Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving trading secret hesi techniques during practice.
Yeah I highly doubt anyone in basketball would pass up on a top 15 player ever and kyrie Irving cuz of an injury concern. Especially when the franchise hasn’t been good in 7 years.

"&gt;Yeah and the sample size is so small that it's virtually worthless. Again, we have an ENTIRE season where he was the ""#1 option"" and he was easily more efficient than current Luka. I think it's safe to say that an entire season matters more than a six and nine game sample size.  Yeah but the reason he couldn't do this in the playoffs is because teams extensively game plan, which is why weaknesses and faults in players are revealed. If you hold the regular season and playoffs on equal footing go ahead but it's def not the norm lol.  &gt;Besides, isn't Irving leading the nets in PPG and usage rate? This ""#1 option"" stuff is getting silly.  \#1 option has to do with defensive attention, Kyrie isn't being guarded the way Luka and Dame are.  &gt;As for your last point, I guess 00-02 kobe wasn't top ten. After all, he wasn't an elite defensive anchor and the #1 option.  Yeah that's mb should've elaborated, being an elite defensive anchor is ONE of the ways to surmount not being the #1 option. Kobe was still the first option in terms of perimeter defensive attention, Kyrie has players like KD or Harden to take that off him.  At the end of the day, the only advantage he has over either Luka or Dame is efficiency, and it's very slight at that. They're both much better playmakers, and have to bare the brunt of the defensive attention a team throws at them. Don't take it the wrong way fam, Kyrie's one of my fav players to watch, just don't think he's on that level."

I'm not even saying Kyrie is top ten, but his efficiency advantage over Luka has very little to do with kd or harden. We saw that in 2019 and 2020."
Crazy that this guy on Reddit isn’t Kyrie Irving. I know that’s hard for you to fathom.
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).  KD."
I'm personally taking Kyrie Irving over Dame &amp; Luka. There isn't some huge gap between any of them. I trust Kyrie over those two against any defense.

Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
"You play well all season during the regular season, and then you wake up and the other team has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it doesn’t matter anymore."
People really need to stop referring to Kyrie Irving as Kai   Cringey as hell
Most years you don’t have kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
"You realize they were traded over a year after Kyrie Irving and Kevin fucking Durant CHOSE to go there, right?"
"I mean the high profile FAs you’re taking about were Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. I love Randle and given his age and contract I do think he’s ultimately a better signing for the Knicks than Durant or Kyrie, but he’s not better than either of them."
Yet Randle keeps getting left off the top 15 on the kia mvp ladder smh. Keep putting Jimmy Butler and Kyrie Irving ahead of him.
Currys not really a playoff performer. They would have lost in 2015 too if klove and Kyrie Irving had played
"Jimmy Butler and Kyrie Irving own an underwear company together. They didn’t start the company, but they’re both heavily invested in it.  https://www.psdunderwear.com"
"I am one. Kyrie Irving is who got be psyched about bball. So my loyalty lies wherever he goes. Also, I'm not from the US so I don't have any geographical obligation to support a specific team."
"That's true, but Kyrie is one of those black Americans who does have Native ancestry. [His mother was Sioux](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24444427/kyrie-irving-embraces-native-american-heritage-sioux-naming-ceremony-nba), and she was born in the Reservation at Standing Rock."
"If Trae came into the league in any other context people would be freaking out about him and recognizing him as a historically great young player, but I guess it was decided with the Luka trade that he cannot ever be good   Remember last year when Trae by impact metrics was the worst defensive player to ever pick up a basketball and it was essentially 4v5 with him on the court so no amount of offensive impact could ever erase that?  But then this year Damian Lillard is worse, Kyrie Irving and Ja Morant are equally as bad, and everyone mysteriously forgot about all the defensive impact metrics?"
"""Stop lying to your people, Europe and America. The original people are returning""   - Kyrie Irving, POS"
Are we all gonna collectively ignore the fact that apparently Kyrie Fucking Irving converted to islam like 2 months ago?
It doesn't surprise me at all that Kyrie Irving is a recent convert to Islam.

"There's nuance and context in every case. The cases where people got punished was due to direct contact to someone with confirmed covid, or being in an enclosed space during a time vaccine was rare.

If you can't see the difference then I don't know what will"
"well, yeah, i've personally seen Kyrie go nuclear in the playoffs, even in the finals.  I've also seen a lot of Harden doing the exact opposite.  Last year both in the OKC series and the lakers series, his play was massively underwhelming.   Without Durant, aren't they similar to Houston?  They've just swapped out westbrook with irving, and a few wily older big vets instead of the wily older 3 point shooting vets.  Heck, even d'antoni is still there.    What's the argument that Steph and Harden are better than KD and Lebron?  I can maybe see a case for KD since he's been hurt and has to do less, but what's the argument that either is better than the current reigning finals mvp?  aside from like free throws?"
[Huh?](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kyrie-Irving-with-the-NBA-Championship-Trophy-Game-7-of-the-2016-NBA-Finals-Photo-Print-16-x-20/402594305)
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
"Agreed. Curry is amazing. Though I’d think Kyrie Irving, when he decides to play, is on the same pure skill level. Not as great of a shooter but an amazing finisher near the paint. Those two guys are fucking incredible.   I try to copy them in pick up games. And holy fuck has it worked easily. (Remind, this is post a 20lb COVID gain)"
"here's the thing, we need to start talking about players in tiers rather than just arbitrary cut-offs at 5 or 10 players or whatever.  The reality is that there are more than 5 players in the NBA that have a top 3 or top 5 ceiling, and on any given night they might be there.  Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving aren't top 5 players in the NBA, but on any given night they can be the best player on the planet if that makes sense.  The differences between the elite guys in the top tiers of players are so marginal that you can make credible cases for them to be put in almost any order."

mentioning pawns reminds me of Kyrie Irving
You can see the Kyrie Irving spot just inside the left wing all alone.
Haha what are you smoking!? LeBron played with prime Dwayne Wade and Kyrie Irving. Chris Bosh and Kevin Love. Fuck.
Yup most of the Kyrie Irving Slander comes from this... it's so sad to see
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"Certainly there's Asian bias, I'll even provide you with some examples:  * [1st team all state (California) alongside Ryan Anderson, James Harden and Chase Budinger; co-MVP with Kevin Durant of McDonald's All American game](https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/california/post/_/id/631/jeremy-lin-and-the-2006-all-state-team). Despite these accolades, he doesn't get any scholarship offers to notable colleges, aside from a walk-on at Stanford and a full ride with Harvard. * Slam Online article ""Life in the Fast Lane"" shared Lin's Draft Combine scores (or BAM):AVERAGE SPEED Jeremy Lin: 16.66 mph Derrick Rose: 16.60 mph John Wall: 16.48 mph Kyrie Irving: 15.67 mph Lin wins this battle.START SPEED Lin: 13.93 mph Wall: 13.25 mph Irving: 12.64 mph For Rose, BAM has only average speed data. Lin wins this battle too.TOP SPEED Lin: 18.85 mph Wall: 19.30 mph Irving: 18.74 mph Lin comes in second to Wall.Yet he's ""deceptively athletic"" * [Michael Lewis, economist and author behind Moneyball talks about why Daryl Morey passed on Lin; despite his metrics demanding he be drafted in top 15](https://youtu.be/tQ5hfd2lkLs?t=314)  Mind you, the evidence of bias I've provided is all based on Lin prior to joining the NBA. While we can argue that he's not in the NBA currently due to age or injuries, I wonder if perhaps things would be different had he gone to an actual top 16 college; or been drafted where the scouting metrics had him; or been acknowledged for his physical attributes.  Your 50 downvotes are certainly due to fans of Lin who are biased in their opinion, but the greater bias lies elsewhere."
"It's pretty ugly.  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 8 out of 100: James, Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 13 players, only 6 were top 3 picks and just 4 were first overall -- over 20 years."
Yeah if I’m Russell Westbrook I want to have to play against Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons on defense instead of Kyrie Irving and Blake Griffin
Kyrie Andrew irving
And it's all because of that no good dirty rotten ring stealing Kyrie Irving
i was gonna say i might have to add Elite Rim Protector kyrie irving to the list
"That was a bit intentional, I didn’t want to give it away and I don’t think anyone would think to compare Kyrie to Sexton.   Shit, I’m not even doing that, it’s just weird that there’s so much of a gap between how the league views Sexton and how they viewed Irving"
"Ball handling might be KD's worst skill, that means jack shit when you're that great at everything else. With guys their height you don't really look at ball handling they're god damn kyrie irving."
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier. Sounds like a pretty solid team to me. Except it wasn't, and we know exactly why, because only one of those guys is still a shitty teammate. And it just so happens he was supposed to be the one that held it all together."
"Dude this isn't Law and Order, anyone who followed that team knows exactly why the locker room was cancerous, and his name is Kyrie Irving. He pulled the same exact shit last year in Brooklyn, and the only reason no one is paying attention now is because he's being shielded by two better players and an insanely overperforming team. If Brooklyn was .500 this year, those missed games for ""personal reasons"" would become a lot more controversial."
"KAT stands for Karl-Anthony Towns, KAI stands for Kyrie Andrew Irving, don't see what's wrong with that."
Kyrie irving. 50 40 90
"The dude fuckin ""smudged"" the arena when he came back to Boston in the pre-season. I think the obsession goes both ways:  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kyrie-irving-explains-why-he-burned-sage-around-td-garden-court-prior-to-nets-preseason-game-against-celtics/"
"KAI are his initials, Kyrie Andrew Irving."
Theres only one ex Celtic I have distaste for. Kyrie. Irving.
"He’s better now for one then he was when him and wall were making their playoff runs I’d argue...also if you really just switched d Mitchell and Beal do you really think either the jazz or the wizards would be in a different situation...or a kyrie Irving with this wizards instead of brad what would that look like...brad has no spacing and is avg 30 point on 50 percent shooting do you even think Murray would excel like this? I just don’t know if people know what they are watching...imagine Beal on the nuggets instead of murray, oh my god it would disgusting"
"I agree with this example. Ray Allen also “only” had 2 all-nba selections, but at least he was a 10x all star.   Some other guys:  - Vince Carter (2x all-nba, 8x all star) - Chris Bosh (1x all-nba, 11x all star) - Ray Allen (2x all-nba, 10x all star) - Kyrie Irving (2x all-nba, 7x all star)"
"I will take prime, healthy, Iron-Man Bosh every day of the week, consistent, doesn't quit on his teammates, over Kyrie Irving as my third option, every day of the week.   Did you get a chance to watch Bosh when he was on the Raptors?"
"true but we've also never seen 3 stars of this caliber team up and not to mention the stacked bench, it's still Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving"
"yeah but that adds the variable of refs. kyrie irving gets to the rim and gets fouled with a LOT of no calls, meanwhile dame does the same thing and gets more calls."
would you rather have Simmons defending Kyrie Irving or Mike James?
"Considering the top tier of PGs includes Steph Curry &amp; Kyrie Irving, he still isn't in it even with a theoretical 22/7 (which would be better than even his best year)"
"If this blows your mind, wait until you hear about Kyrie Irving"
"&gt; And we did build our team, we didn’t need several free first rounders to do it either.  Just nets superfan Kyrie Irving to convince his best friend and free agent Kevin Durant to team up with him. And then for them to convince James Harden to shoot his way off his team to join them."

"The only correction I'd make is his FT shooting is fine he just doesn't get the line enough. For someone as athletically gifted as Wiggins, he is pretty bad at getting fouled. Kinda Kyrie Irving syndrome where he avoids contact in the paint"
Probably the second one and that a lot of other notable players copied Kobe’s moves (kyrie irving being a notable example) so players can learn the move from not just Kobe himself.   Edwards is 19 and he picked up basketball late so he’s probably grew up more in the Lebron/KD/Steph/Harden era than 08-010 when Kobe was everywhere. I could be wrong tho just a guess
"Good column, even if I don't agree with all the choices.   But the end where he says he picked Kyrie for 3rd team because he felt like he had to pick someone from the Nets is just lazy.  &gt; As for Irving, it felt wrong having zero Nets even if circumstances would have justified it. Irving has been the closest thing to a constant among Brooklyn's three stars, and was unstoppable: 27 points on 50/40/90 shooting. He was efficient in crunch time. On most nights, he competed on defense with active hands. &gt;  &gt; The Nets outscored opponents (barely, but still) when Irving played without both Harden and Kevin Durant."

I remember 2 months ago when half this sub was convinced that Kyrie Irving was about to retire.
Lmao wtf is that lighting. Did you color correct this? Is Kyrie Irving low-key directing a movie starring people who have no idea they are in it?
KYRIE IRVING 50 40 90 CLUB
"You’re just replying to say something. His performance against the Warriors, Jazz, and POR were not due to injuries. More so against OKC/LA last year. He had 3 20+ games against LA but also 2 10 point games. Coming off injury he had 7/17/20 against OKC. Proof is in the pudding and unless he can make it out the first round without a co-star, he’s not going to be considered a playoff threat. I doubt Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are shitting their pants over someone that couldn’t get past Joe Ingles and a Rookie"
"I legitimately read ""Kyrie Irving used his press conference to discuss Palpatine"" and thought that's classic Kyrie, maybe he's watching Bad Batch – until I got to ""and Israel"" haha. W nonetheless."
"VanVleet is roughly 5’11 Klay Thompson to me. But he definitely has his flaws.   Playing off ball, he’s amazing. We’ve seen it time and time again from going supernova in the playoffs to dropping 54 points on 11 made 3’s. His jumper is elite and his on-ball defense is potentially the best amongst guys his size in the league. True 3 and D stud.  But then there’s his weaknesses. It’s a block party whenever he drives to the rim. He has very little shot creation for himself yet likes to think he’s Kyrie Irving for long stretches. He’ll get supreme tunnel vision and it’s the most frustrating thing to watch in the world.   So he’s best in a specific role where he just plays off-ball and plays stellar defense but sadly he wants to be a lead playmaker which just isn’t the best role for him."

Ray Allen and Kyrie Irving.
"I feel like you've fallen for the reverse circle jerk and assume Harden is a decent defender, when he's still horrible at defending in space (his teams need to switch for him to be effective). Harden might be one of the worst player at fighting through screens. While Kyrie has shown an ability to turn his defence on and at least be decent at getting through a screen (see his 2016 finals performance).   He's still not a good defender, but he has more scheme versatility than Harden. Though it's fucking stupid to think Irving is a better or more important basketball player."
"This is some Donald Trump Charlottesville ""violence on both sides""-ass bullshit. How could Kyrie Irving of all people miss a layup as easy as condemning ethnic cleansing."
gotta love defending Kyrie Irving as a point guard by saying the shooting guard can distribute
Kyrie Irving is spectacular.
"Guys, are we forgetting Kyrie Irving in all of this?"
Kyrie Irving
"Yeah, is he trying to accuse Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving of being racist against black coaches? It makes no sense"
"Name a GM that wouldn’t trade IT the pick that became Colin Sexton and Jae Crowder for Kyrie Irving and I’ll name you a GM that won’t be around very long. Free agents were never going to Boston because Boston isn’t a cool city to live in. That’s the way the NBA works you want to get a show stopping free agent you better be in Los Angeles Miami New York or the player’s hometown, a big free agent is never signing in Boston."
"One thing I can comprehend is your comments bathed in condescension.  And boy it must feel good to think of yourself as some cogent argument maker.    Pelinka put shooters around Lebron. Not just AD.  The FO hired the right coach. The FO righted the ship when Magic jumped. The FO handled Buss family conflict as well as possible. Jerry West was a great historical GM. Mitch Kupchack was serviceable.  And as far as my deep down internal feelings - I fully concede that it's easier for attractive free agent destination teams to win - and I don't care. I have no psychological problem with this. It doesn't make me feel any more or less about any of the championships. It's sports, not anything I can have a personal impact on. It's just a reality. Just like the Celtics can attract FAs because of their heritage. Just like they can be gifted KG from McHale.  I'm not bitter about other teams having advantages like you seem to be.  I will say that for all the ""nobody wants to make a trade with Danny Ainge"" and ""Brad Stevens is a genius coach"" you all didn't seem to accomplish much, if anything. But you were able to attract Kyrie Irving and he isn't some throw-in FA. So maybe your FO isn't so great either."

"Lmaaaaaooooo this is such a shitty take.   2015-2017: WHY ARENT THE CS TRADING FOR BOOGIE TO BECOME 2ND ROUND EXITS???  2017: Celtics trade for Kyrie Irving   2017-2019: OHMYGOD THE CELTICS CANT STAY HEALTHY. THEY SHOULD TRADE THEIR FUTURE PIECES FOR A YEAR LONG RENTAL.   Irving leaves, Hayward breaks his legs, horford leaves, etc etc etc....  That was all freak luck. When you break it down, Ainge provided the Celtics an amazing championship window from 2017-2020 but it fell short. You can't blame him for not trading for Kawhi. I would rather have Jaylen brown. Ask any C's fan.   The only bad, unjustifiable moves that have happened have been from late 2019-now, when he signed panic signed Kemba. In hindsight he should've kept Terry and have him start but he the Charlotte contract at the time was huge.   ALSO, everyone keeps bringing up: OHMYGOD AINGE COULSVE HAD MYKES TURNER BUT HE ASKED FOR TOO MUCH!!!!   No. No. That's not what fucking happened. Hayward was asking for too much money to sign and trade and Ainge was asking for those players becuase they needed to be included to make a deal work. Then MJ swooped in with the bag and killed the deal. Long story short, Indy didn't want Hayward for the price MJ was offering becuase they didn't have the fucking cap space to make it work without sending over someone like McDermott with Turner.   Rant over. You're being way too harsh in Ainge, especially coming from a goddamn Bulls fan. What has your gm done besides land Zach Lavine and an aging Vuc?"
"It was a horrible look for the Celtics after IT played through the hip injury that derailed his career. Basically torpedoed their shot at AD but Celtics fans won’t acknowledge that.   [I would never want my son to play for Boston after what they done to Isaiah Thomas,"" Anthony Davis Sr. told ESPN on Friday, referencing the former Celtics star point guard who was traded for Kyrie Irving amid his recovery from a hip injury. ""No loyalty. Guy gives his heart and soul and they traded him.""](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/02/01/ads-dad-id-never-want-my-son-to-play-for-boston/)   There’s a right way to trade a franchise hero and a wrong way. The Celtics move was widely panned by players."
"Man I don’t know how the fuck people come to these conclusions. Ainge is one of the top GMs in the league. He let go Isaiah at exactly the right moment. Scary Terry at exactly the right moment. Signed Irving, signed Hayward, signed Kemba. Drafted Tatum, drafted Brown.  In a normal universe the Celtics would’ve won rings by now. It isn’t his fault shit imploded for unforeseeable reasons. It isnt his fault Horford decided to leave for Philly to fuck up both teams. It isnt his fault Kyrie goes 1 for 39394 in big playoff series.  Now, I don’t know *what* needs to be done to change things. Obviously something. I don’t know what to feel about these front office moves. But calling into question Ainge’s competency is more than idiotic."
"Plenty of things have to do with race, but you cant just throw out ""he got the job because he is white"" and let that be your argument. You are defaming an organization and a person without any sort of proof or real argument. If your argument is ""well there are black people who would also like that job"", then thats not really an argument.  Brad Stevens wasnt great this season, but they have made it to the ECF 3 times with him. He started with a team that was supposed to have Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, lost both of them, and is just as competitive without them.  Its one thing if Stevens is just unqualified for the job. He isnt. Who are the black people you would put ahead of him? He knows the celtics culture, players, fanbase, and has a good relationship with the back office."
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
The only man who can stop KD/James Harden/Kyrie Irving.
"A couple of years ago they had Irving Hayward Brown Tatum Horford Rozier Smart Morris Theis Williams all on the roster. As Tatum moves into his prime you would think they would try to improve the roster each season but its been going the other way, and now they really only have Brown Smart Williams an injured Kemba Walker making $30 million a year.  I think the Celtics honestly just got a bit unlucky. Haywards injury, Kyrie heel turning on the city, Philly losing their minds and offering Horford that contract, Kemba getting hurt, Turner being snatched out from under them, etc."
And you are comparing those players to Kyrie Irving.   It probably still would have been sexton though because the Celtics would have needed a guard and not a wing.
"I don't understand this take.  Trade for Kyrie was amazing.  Drafting Smart, Brown, and Tatum was amazing, franchise-changing.  He assembled a team with Smart, Brown, Tatum, Irving, Horford, and Hayward.  Ainge was great, sometimes things just don't work out."
Lebron played with kyrie and elite shooters everywhere on the floor. And he did put up great numbers and we praised him for it. We can also praise harden. It’s not a coincidence that lebrons post season numbers spiked when he played next to Irving and love who provided him space
Kyrie Irving
"To be honest....... Jrue Holiday isn't *that* far away from a Kyrie Irving. What he lacks in offense he makes up for in defense. Yes, Harden/KD is a clearly better #2 than Middleton (who is still a great player).  It depends on the rest of the team makeup. Do the Bucks have enough on the rest of their roster to overcome what they lose in their top 3?"
Kyrie “Bone Saw” Irving
Pissed away what window? Tatum is 23 and Brown is 24. The reason the Hayward and Irving window didnt work is because they both got injured the first year together and then Kyrie literally quit on the team in the 2nd.   Ainge has been operatating on 2 windows and the 1st one not working has more factors than Ainge not being bold enough
Kyrie Irving gave Brad Stevens coaching depression

Honest question: Does Kyrie Irving have Bipolar disorder? This is potentially a hypomania type of thing.
Kevin Durant James Harden and Kyrie Irving amount for a win tbh
Kyrie “daenerys targaryen” Irving
This is a level-headed take. Celtics tried to build something and it didn't work out and as the star Kyrie deserves a good chunk of the blame but some Celtics fans go overboard and assign him 110% of the blame. I don't think people will ever come to terms with it and both sides will hate each other the rest of the way but Tatum I think really looks up to Kyrie Irving despite how Celtics fans feel about Kyrie.
Kyrie Andrew Irving folks.
"Irving is 14-13 without Harden this season, Durant is 11-7 without Harden. Harden 7-2, Durant 7-1 without Irving.  Kyrie only played 52 games, Nets were 12-6 without him and 36-18 with him (ie no change).   I know there are other factors like injuries etc but I just don’t see how Kyrie was critical for you guys like Dame was for the Blazers, Trae was for the Hawks - these two guys absolutely dominated as offensive hubs en route to the playoffs with much weaker teams.   Mitchell and CP3 ran the offenses of the two best RS teams with great numbers. Kyrie was barely .500 without Harden.   Simmons is a close one - his offensive value is barely all star level but he is in DPOY contention. I think that combined package is better than Kyrie’s borderline All-NBA offense and slightly net negative defense.   Kyrie’s only argument against any of these guys is efficiency - the other guys are clearly more fundamental to their team’s success and much more valuable as a result. Defense, floor raising, availability, all also clearly not in Kyrie’s favour."
He's wearing red coloured Kyrie Irving socks while everyone else are wearing black NBA socks
"Kyrie ""The Menace"" Irving with his first 2 points. Let's see if he can find that pot of gold by the end of the game."
"&gt;Durant came in one day to [a film session], he was the first one in film room. He walked up to Kyrie Irving and said, ‘What does underdog mean to you?’  &gt;So Irving went into some absolute soliloquy saying absolutely nothing because he didn’t know what kind of trap door any sort of word was. And then Irving said, ‘What’s it mean to you, Kevin?’ Kevin said, ‘Warriors.'"
"Perfect games by KD, Harden, and Irving means they combine for 110-120 points.  30 point games for KD is an average game for him, not a perfect game. Same with Kyrie. Same with Harden."
Yeah...and a lot of people who hate kyrie irving in New England so I think he’ll be alright lol
Kyrie Irving.
"Hahaha aright, you’ll move the goalposts no matter what I say. It’s fine.  “You’re yelling fuck you at him. He fucked your first? Get over it, and don’t say shit again about it. He’s allowed to fuck you over, you need to get over it and don’t say shit. And if he does respond by stomping your logo, don’t say shit to that either. Just shut the fuck up and sit silently in the stands or at home.”  What you’re saying. We can’t say or do anything correctly unless it’s groveling at the feet of Kyrie.  “Oh, thank you mr. Irving for graciously blessing our franchise for two years. We really needed you for that Indiana sweep in 2019. We would’ve never gotten lost that hobbled team without you!”"
"fans overrate scoring in blow out games  KAT has been shut down by Embiid, Capela, AD, Bam, he’s not this generational scorer yet people act like he’s the C version of Kyrie Irving"
It’s simple. We get kyrie arrested.   https://www.change.org/p/national-basketball-association-arrest-kyrie-irving-for-assault-with-a-dangerous-weapon?redirect=false
Abuse them on the boards. Isolate kyrie Irving every possession and attack him. Pray that jrue/middleton can hve the defensive performances of their career and defend kyrie/harden/Durant one on one.   Lopez/Portis/Forbes have to be able to stay on the floor against the nets. If they’re getting picked apart the bucks won’t have enough shooting to keep up.   Giannis has to be the best player in the series. He has that capability. He’s in a dream matchup against a twam that has no interior presence at all. If he can’t dominate the series then it’s likely over.
"I got no love for Kyrie Irving. He’s a man who does a lot of good for other people and I respect that. But, his comments and actions in this series, nevertheless his lame exit from Boston, will have me forever rooting against him.  He’s made himself a villain, and he should expect to be treated as such by fans. That said, fans should not be throwing stuff at players.  Want to see the team (Celtics) respond tonight with physicality and make sure Brooklyn remembers them win or lose."
Kyrie Irving
"Ok so re-read what I wrote because it seems you didn't. And I don't give a rats ass about Kyrie or the Celtics. But it's clear he meant to disrespect the organization and to pretend otherwise is to be willfully ignorant. Even he wouldn't say ""I don't know why people are mad."" He knows what he did and why he did it that's it. I have no problem with it because I couldn't care less about the Celtics, if you do care about them then it's reasonable to be upset with Irving. That's it. End of story."
Don’t forget that Kyrie Irving launched a basketball as hard as he could into the stands and hit a child.
I mean that's fair. I was just being a dick about the current state of media/social media/celebrity douchebags tbh. The guy very well could be a racist for all we know but assuming it because he likely was drunk and mad at Kyrie Irving/his own team is uhhh troubling to me to say the least lol.  With that said I don't condone the bottle throwing at all. Learn how to handle something that doesn't go your own way and not be a fucking idiot about it.
All this fake outrage over Kyrie Irving and a fucking logo
"Beer bottles are glass and are easily more dangerous than a plastic water bottle (that was very likely half-filled). I'm not denying that it might hurt someone, if it happened to be full. What I don't buy is the idea that anyone who threw a water bottle at someone else would ever get charged with it, if they were a normal person. This is all a big show by the DAs and police because it's a celebrity like Kyrie Irving."
"The fan that threw the empty water bottle at Kyrie Irving is being charged with assault and battery with a *deadly* weapon.   If he was black he would be getting the electric chair, I agree with you. Black dudes can't chew bubble gum and watch an NBA game without cops showing up en masse to execute them for no reason.   Kyrie and his fellow black NBA players are truly oppressed and I sympathize with them. Their many millions of dollars they are paid to play a game is some small consolation at least."
"Kyrie Irving... Lakers fan in London so I used to catch the trash early East coast games when young players on bad teams would Duke it out. Caught a lot of young Kyrie and John Wall and as much as the Cavs weren’t winning, man is he fun to watch. I’ve had to route against him a lot with my anti Lebron bias and obvious anti Celtics bias but he’s really an artist on the court.  While routing against him, I’ve developed an affinity for Curry and Lillard."
"Brooklyn has Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, and the rest of the team isn't even awful. It's the biggest CHOKE in NBA HISTORY if the nets do not win the championship this year."
Kyrie Irving on the list?
I think Nurk is the second best player on the Blazers. Harris might be better than Simmons at this point. I’d probably do a lineup of:  Kyrie Irving  Jrue Holiday  Andrew Wiggins  Kyle Anderson (or any 3&amp;D PF)  Ayton
 Kyrie Irving
"Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, James Harden..."
"This entire thread is about a bad, and clearly ignorant take from over a decade ago. So yes, the topic is the comment, and making a stink over it now, 11 years later simply to point fingers and shame. And yes, this is common social media outrage. And it's terrible for discourse. Hivemind attitudes maligning people whether it's Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Bill Simmons (right now), or the next person. And for fucking what? It's a circle jerk of self satisfaction.   And your list of Bill Simmons grievances are frankly unrelated. You could cherry pick things to fit your argument, as could someone trying to prove the opposite.   Until something completely egregious occurs, maybe try to cut people some slack?"
"I don't have a source, but I am positive Kyrie Irving told a kid who came over to play at his house, ""my house my rules"" ."
"Name something more sensitive than a Kyrie Irving. Dude is made of glass, physically and mentally"
"The flat earth shit. The constant media drama. The guy sounds increadibly condescending everytime he's spoken in the past 5 years. Giving up on the celtics. Calling out the role players in brooklyn after he plays like shit early on before he recruited 2 of the best players in the league to win him a championship because he failed at leading a team on his own. His lack of self awareness. His pretentiousness.  The guy called reporters ""pawns""... what do you think he thinks of fans?  Fuck kyrie irving, he might be the least likable athlete ive ever seen. His handles are great and he gives some of his money to activist charities and thats great. Doesn't make his personality any better. Nobody would like being around someone like kyrie Irving if he didn't play basketball well."
"I'm sorry...an assault with a deadly weapon? It's a plastic bottle, it's not like Kyrie Irving is a god damn sea turtle. I know they want to send a message but holy shit. Was terroristic activities off the table or something?"
Oof. Imagine comparing her to Kyrie Irving.
"If it weren’t disrespectful Kyrie wouldn’t have done it, as much as idiots on /r/NBA want to argue otherwise.  It was disrespectful when we chanted “FUCK YOU KY-RIE” too.  Just because it’s part of what makes the sport fun doesn’t mean it isn’t disrespectful. It’s fun *because* it’s disrespectful. If you don’t think it’s disrespectful and go “it’s just a piece of painted hardwood” then you’re a giant cuck and I imagine get stepped on (no pun intended) all the time in real life.  It’s fun/funny the crowd chanted fuck Kyrie. It’s fun/funny Kyrie stepped on Lucky. Both are disrespectful and that’s the point. If they weren’t neither side would’ve done what they did.  Fuck water bottle guy too, but I don’t know why this thread is so hellbent on him anyway since that happened *after* everything else. He’s sitting in a cell right now. I’m about 100% certain KD wasn’t talking about water bottle guy vs. Kyrie Irving and was instead referring to the city of Boston vs. ex girlfriend Kyrie Irving"

"It's a lesser charge, dangerous weapon not deadly weapon. We can argue all day about whether or not its a good idea to charge people with that, but thats the law. If I'm out partying on some city street and a cop sees me throw a water bottle at someone and wants to charge me, he can do that. This is the same situation. That's why you don't throw shit. I'm not alienated as a fan, I'm mad that the guy threw a bottle. There's no place for that bullshit at a game. I think it's unrealistic to expect Kyrie Irving to hear about what happened and take a stand on the issue."
"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.)"

Kyrie Irving is secretly a JoJo

The crime is in the attempt, not the result...and would probably be worse if it HAD struck someone.  Obviously calling a water bottle a ""dangerous weapon"" is a stretch, but that's pretty boilerplate according to the law when you throw an object at someone.  As someone who has actually been hit with a water bottle when I was a kid and it drew blood (hit me in the back of the head, the rim of the lid cut my scalp)...the punishment fits the crime. People have to be held accountable sometimes."

Kyrie I don't talk to poor people Irving
"This is the reason fans can't stand Kyrie Irving.  It has nothing to do with racism.  It has everything to do with the fact that he is a giant self absorbed primadonna, with zero clue on the activities in the real world.   He needs to take a long walk on a short pier.  Preferably one that leads to the edge of his flat earth. Can't stand this guy.  If he dissapeared from this earth tomorrow nobody would give a shit."
"None of what you’re saying has ANYTHING to do with your original post which refers to Houston’s (paraphrase) &gt;&gt;Failure to surround James Harden with other offensive talent that eliminates his need to fight through multiple coverage&lt;&lt;.  I point out that the standard of a front office surrounding their star player with literal generational talent is a totally unfair expectation.  Then, when pointed out that Harden played with great talents such as Russell Westbrook and CP3, you switch focus from the front office to now say Hardens help either sucked or weren’t available. Ironically, Kevin Durant and Kyrie have been LESS available than either CP3 or RW. Furthermore, I disagree and say Hardens talent was plenty good with great spacing and a team built to his strengths.  Now you say you’re talking about playoffs only. Well, Harden played plenty of games with CP3 and Capela and never before average 80% TS. Then you somehow go on to talk about Harden having to average 36 a game to GET INTO the playoffs, which completely deviates from you saying we’re only talking about playoffs.  I didn’t bother reading the rest. Pick what you want to say. You’re all over the place with this bullshit.  Harden is great. His lack of surrounding talent wasn’t what was preventing him from unlocking god mode scoring, assist, and efficiency. He had talent. He still put up amazing numbers. Now he has generational talent. So now he’s putting up ungodly numbers. You’re implying that with literally any good player, Harden can be this efficient. I’m telling you no, he’s playing with Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving."
" &gt; • How many games did Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving play with Harden? In comparison to CP3 / Capela?  Not sure why that’s relevant given  a) the nets are in the East and literally second seed despite Harden playing 36 games this season (best believe Houston would not make it out the west)   b) I was talking about the playoffs as well  &gt; • Is # of games played together relevant at all? Or is only the games they played together relevant? See the previous item when answering this question.  What?  &gt; • Which seasons do you want to talk about in regards to this with player availability in the first place?  Again, you’re not understanding my point. You’re absolutely delusional if you don’t think Harden HAD to average 36 pts a game for an entire yr + bust his ass off for the last 5 years just to get us to the playoffs, then lose steam come playoffs. Meanwhile nets are a top seed without him having to break a sweat. Why do you think that is? Regardless, we didn’t have it in Houston.   &gt; • We just gonna let you write off Russell fucking Westbrook like he’s not on the general same tier of talent?  I love Russ and he’s definitely one of the GOATs, but the whole small ball experiment and trading CP/Capela etc was a mistake. Him and Harden don’t work as well as Harden/CP, but I also understand the trade was done because of Westbrook’s longevity. Ironically, he got injured right before the playoffs as well...  &gt; • What does player injury history have to do with front office surrounding players with talent that demand opponent defensive coverage?  It means that those players are not available to play games and take away defensive attention lmao? CP and Harden worked very well when they played together, but when CP was injured, nobody was there to take defensive coverage away from Harden. Make sense?  &gt; • What other valuable role players did Harden with? Ariza? Gordon? Covington? Other great floor spacers?  And look at them all now, all shit. Harden has a tendency to make role players look a lot better than they are. It’s what he does. Remember Mclemore? None of these guys can take any defensive attention away from Harden... maybe Gordon when he used to remember how to play pre knee injuries, but that man has not had a single good game since 2017"
"Donte DiVincenzo is out, which means that Bryn Forbes will likely spend significant time guarding one of Kyrie Irving or James Harden. Other than that, the Bucks are a great matchup, and it's a series I'm looking forward to, win or loss."
"Put your hindsight aside. *Context matters.*  ATL was 11th in the East before the ASG.   Also, if you want Trae in, pick one of these guards to substitute at the time of the All Star Game.  - Ben Simmons - Jaylen Brown - James Harden - Zach Lavine - Kyrie Irving - Bradley Beal  Personally, I'd have swapped Jaylen for Trae. But that would've been incredibly unpopular before March 8th LOL."
"oh yeah, absolutely, thats why if he was still playing, that buyouts would be illegal energy would be louder, but since he retired and blake griffin is playing like crap, thats definitely subsided  also, speaking of which, the nets roster reads like an all star team lol, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan. That's an all star team from 2-3 years ago hahaha"
"I mean Harden is great, but a series against Boston without Jaylen Brown better be child's play on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving."
Right did fucking J Jonah Jameson post this 😂😂😂😂 GET ME PICTURES OF KYRIE IRVING
Boston fans deserve credit in regards to Kyrie Irving
"Kyrie ""Plato"" Irving"
KYRIE IRVING
"kevin ""kyrie irving"" durant"
He just doesn’t look good compared to Kyrie Irving.  I wonder what Giannis will do now that he won’t make the conference final again. Switch teams?
See: Tonight for my point.  He was barely positive game 1 and he had likely the best game of his career  Playing drop coverage on Kyrie Irving is fucking laughable.
WHY DO YOU DROP BACK AGAINST KYRIE FREAKIN IRVING
Ughhhhhhhhh lopez dropping back against KYRIE IRVING
"But it just looks like such a tall order nabbing 4 games from this team...  So many other teams are struggling with injuries but with the Nets is like “oh look MVP Harden goes down in the first minute! *yaaaawn*... looks like MVP KD gonna get deep minutes.”  And then you got one of the best shooters in the league with Harris, Blake Griffin and his Benjamin Buttoning knees, and even Mike James, who’s playing as well as how Dennis Schroeder thinks he’s playing.   And fucking Kyrie Irving balling out like every bucket he makes kills one of his enemies."
https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/study-whos-the-mosthated-team-in-the-nba-right-now  https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/6/4/22519241/in-latest-surveys-of-fan-hatred-nets-most-hated-team-kyrie-irving-second-most-hated-player    only two I could find quickly
"Because they haven't won anything yet.  Durant signed with a bad team, and is coming off an injury.  Their depth isn't that impressive.  Kyrie Irving is a wild card.  Also, they do get hate.  Fuck all three of the big 3."
"I am SHOCKED that a team with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Blake Griffin is moonwalking to the NBA finals"
Khris “Kash Money” Middleton is getting locked up by Kyrie Irving
"Empty possession after empty possession against the defensive stalwarts, Blake griffin, mike James, and kyrie Irving. Inexcusable"
People act like Blake was washed with the Pistons. Literally anyone can look like an allstart when you have fucking KD &amp; Kyrie Irving passing you the ball.
"Imagine telling someone in 2015 that Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Blake Griffin would eventually all be on the same team"
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, good role players"
"Q1 1:12 MIL 17 · BKN 31 Kyrie Irving has tied Vince Carter for 97th on the All-Time Playoffs points list with 1,593 source: NBA alerts"
Obviously it sucks that Harden is injured. But at the very least playing without him on a national stage in this series will show all the haters around here:  1) Our role players have really improved through out the season  2) Kyrie Irving is a fucking stud
"Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers? That's cool and all, but we have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and that handsome fellow James Harden on the bench."
Kyrie Irving is a basketball genius
kyrie irving looks like he just woke up
"He averages 7 FT attempts per game which is great for any position. He shoots 63% at the rim. For comparison, Kyrie Irving who is a considered an elite finisher at the PG position shot 62% at the cup this season.   He isn't a great defender, I'll give you that, but his offense is so elite that you can live with his defensive shortcomings. Overall, most of the points you were trying to make don't really hold up."
"You should talk to Kyrie Irving then too.  Big talkers defending Boston.  I will never defend racism by any person, but sort of odd that the most educated city in America in the most educated state in America has the most racist fans in America.  Actually it is F'ing SICK!"
"You know, whenever it came up that Olshey gave away the first overall pick  (traded an unprotected pick in a salary dump, barely missed playoffs, accidentally won lottery), people don't really clown him.  I always figured because pick protections might not have been a thing back then.  But then I remember his cap-spike signings and now this and wonder again.  Why don't people clown him for accidentally giving away Kyrie Irving?"
"Kyrie Irving was technically born in Australia, and holds an Australian passport as such, but he won’t be playing for the Boomers"
"Irving and Love were OUT FOR THE SERIES. Bogut was out for a few games, I'll give you that. Draymond was suspended for a game for being a stupid dirty player and Steph was playing """"""through injury"""""".  In reality Steph came from 30 point games in the semis, and probably was at the absolute least at 80% of his game.  Yeah, the Warriors had some pesky issues in 2016 after going 3-1, shit happens, but the ammount of Warriors fans that compare it to Love and Kyrie being out for an entire series is pretty annoying."
&gt;Kyrie Irving is 2nd choice. Kyrie is better than Harden.  Lmao
"Nikola Jokic.   He’s at least a top 3 player in the NBA, but most of y’all don’t even think he’s top 5. He’s just as good as Kawhi and I hope he gets the respect he deserves as being the indisputable 2nd best player in the NBA when he leads the Nuggets to the Finals.  Kyrie Irving is 2nd choice. Kyrie is better than Harden."
"He’s like the same height or around the same as Steph Kyrie Irving, Trae young, and taller than Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry"
"&gt; I'm not sure why people thought Milwaukee was better than a healthy Brooklyn  Because they think they're smart for parroting ""dEfEnSe"" incessantly as if any defence is gonna stop a team with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving."
"Huge Nets fan here, obviously we don't have the greatest interior defense. We do have Claxton who's so far in the playoffs and in the regular season has guarded Giannis very well. We also have DeAndre Jordan but he gets completely exposed on switch-offs and his lack of ability to guard the perimeter at all even to contest a shot. That's the reason he hasn't been playing. What it really comes down to is the bucks hitting shots. Something the Nets proved All season is that it didn't really matter how good your defense was, you just have to outshoot us. I don't expect the bucks to shoot 6 for 30 from 3 again, however to be fair I really don't expect Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving to shoot 25% from 3 again either."
"Luka has 5 40-point playoff games. That’s more than:      Damian Lillard   Carmelo Anthony   Tracy McGrady   Kyrie Irving   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Vince Carter   Tim Duncan   Karl Malone         **Doncic has played only 13 career playoff games. The players above have played at least 50.**"
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to play 44 minutes and Giannis 34 minutes
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
"Paul George- probably   Kyrie Irving- 100%, you can’t tell the story of the NBA without mentioning him  Jimmy Butler- Probably, if he declines further his chances go down. He’s not a HOFer right now   DeMar DeRozan- No, sadly  Rudy Gobert- Needs more. It took Ben Wallace a while and he had a ring against a great team. Defense isn’t valued as much clearly"
"They were 19-17 without Harden this year... they were a pretty average team without him.  And that's still with Kyrie Irving, who barely missed the top 10 list."
Durant is a year removed from tearing his Achilles off the bone on National TV and he’s playing 41 minutes. Kyrie Irving played 45.  What the fuck just leave him in there man!

"giannis could average 40/15 and it wouldn’t matter because kevin durant, kyrie irving, and james harden are on the other team. but I agree, will still be a failure"
Kyrie Andrew Irving is trying his best!
"It really is common sense, you have to match your best players minutes with the opposing teams best players. Especially when it’s Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the other side."
Almost like having Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the same team as you makes it easier to play basketball.
"Which superstar you missing, can’t remember there’s so many? Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin.....??"
"New flash: A team with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, and Blake Griffin is still really fucking good."
Kyrie Irving FEASTING with the passes tonight!
"I feel bad for you guys. Hopefully Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving can carry you guys past the Bucks. I believe in the Nets though. Even as the clear underdogs, they can win out through heart and determination."
Kyrie Irving is also a Franchise Player of the Nets
Kyrie Irving is such a joy to watch.
Kyrie. Irving.
The fact Middleton (6’7”) got blocked by kyrie Irving (6’2”) tells you everything you need to know about Khris Middleton
"I think its ""Kyrie Irving"""
"Why are the fans chanting ""KYRIE IRVING""? weak ass chant lmfao"
Best player in the series Giannis needs some help! If he had Kyrie Irving this game would be over!
Better player?  Jrue Holiday or Kyrie Irving?
"There is no one true answer but we can elaborate and categorize them.  -team was aging and deteriorating,main pieces that includes bosh and wade was not healthy and they were coming to the end.  -in 2014 miami was really hard with the cap space so contract problems -miami was choking in 2014 against spurs,they kinda kicked their asses(4-1)  -(roumor has it)Lebron’s aka leGM communication problem with the eric spo and the other coaches.They say lebron wanted spo gone but pat riley anwered “really harsh”.Some says riley fired back and said “nobody will tell him how to run the organization”.(later that pat riley squashed these rumours but its kinda debateable.)  -Lebron wanted to establish his legacy so no matter what he was going to leave miami to win another ring with different team.  -Cavs was the win-win situation because obviously its his home and wanted to for his people and community, Other thing is young kyrie irving was shining and it could be the wingman for his championship run.  -Also we shouldn’t forget that firstly he was going to sign with knicks in 2010 but then things have changed in a bad way for ny.  Personal opinion:Pat riley believes STAR POWER so he is going to make big moves for the team.Via trading i believe he is going the acquire a star guard(maybe lillard,maybe other candidates).Riley wants miami to compete in championship run through 2023/4-2027."
If Giannis doesn't play nearly the entire second half the Bucks are going to lose. Coach Bud can't pull his sub-36 minutes with Giannis shit against Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
He's kinda been the European Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving is the best point guard Durant has ever played with
Kyrie Irving low-key my favorite of the nets big 3. At least basketball game wise. Very pleasing game.
"yall acting like its over for the nets when they still have KEVIN ""burner"" DURANT and KYRIE ""spitonleprechaun"" IRVING"
Can this heavily depleted roster of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving still compete 🙄
"Yes, but a lot of people really underrate the power and impact of star players for some reason.   Look at all the people who were saying to trade Kyrie Irving for depth.  It's not how the NBA playoffs work outside of the extremely rare anomalies."
MJ was never an underdog and never took a team down 3-1 vs what would have easily been claimed as the best team of all time. The hunger of retiring in the middle of his prime with a giant gambling issue really makes MJ an underdog... Kevin Love being on your team 100% makes it a super team... Anyone remember the trash LJ took to the finals when Kyrie Irving left(huge super team)?
I'm going to answer your question with several questions:  Will Kevin Durant say something with passive aggressive undertones anonymously through a Twitter burner account?  Will Kyrie Irving continue to miss basketball games because he is in his feelings?  Will James Harden get fat in the off-season in large part from partying at strip clubs and 'making it rain' ?
"Yeah, I didn't watch a lot of Pistons games, but when they played against the Hornets it always felt weird that he wanted to do Kyrie Irving shit as a big guy, I remember he did one play that break I think Dwight or Cody ankles and he tried to do it over and over again just because one time it worked lol."
Kevin Durant and James Harden have never won any Eastern Conference playoff games without Kyrie Irving. Really makes you think.
"All of which still doesn't counteract the point that Harris + an average shooter is not overall better spacing than two elite shooters. Lets look at the most used Nets lineups these playoffs:  KD, Griffin, Harden, Kyrie, Harris: 64 mins  KD, Harden, Irving, Brown, Harris: 28  Green, Claxton, Harden, Harris, Shamet: 13  KD, Brown, Harden, Griffin, Irving: 12  Harden, Harris, Johnson, Claxton, Shamet: 10  &amp;#x200B;  Now for the Clips  Batum, Kawhi, PG, Morris, Jackson: 78 mins  Beverley, PG, Morris, Kawhi, Zubac : 23 mins  PG, Kawhi, Jackson, Morris, Zubac: 15 mins  Rondo, Batum, PG, Morris, Kawhi: 13 mins  Rondo, Batum, Kawhi, Mann, Zubac: 9 mins  Overall that's an incredibly similar amount of spacing that Kawhi and Harden have played with these playoffs. The most well spaced Nets lineup that is at least functional defensively: Kyrie, KD, Harden, Harris, Green, is not even one of their top 5 most used lineups so far. Meanwhile, the Clippers have played their most optimally spaced lineup possible for the heaviest number of minutes."
Its not very hard to play great as a former MVP in ur prime playing alongside another former MVP in his prime and Kyrie Irving...
"You also have to take into account they’re now coming up against Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, who despite not seeming that motivated, are probably more than ready mentally to take on the Bucks  I can’t fucking wait"
"Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving"
Kyrie is better than Harden. Explain why Kyrie is the 2nd option? No one remembers anything Hardens done in the playoffs except choke. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving will be the two best players in this Bucks series. Nets in 4.
Why don't Australian born Kyrie Irving get some love?
Harden also plays next to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
**Kobe vs Wade** - Kobe  **Duncan vs  Garnett** - Tim Duncan  **Dirk vs  Robinson** - Dirk Nowitizi  Some of my own:   **James Harden vs Kevin Durant**  **Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker vs Bradley Beal**  **Rudy Gobert vs KAT**  **Jimmy Butler vs Kyrie Irving**
"I am not a LeBron stan but this post is so bad and relies on zero context for anything and is solely made to shit on LeBron.   &gt;2007 - Lebron’s Cavs finished 2nd in the East with a modest tally of 50 Wins, which would have placed them 6th in the West. They got dominated and swept 4-0 in the finals.  His team was terrible with the second best player being Boobie Gibson. The fact that team makes the finals at all is an achievement and he loses to the best team in the league and one of the best of decade.   &gt;2011 - Lebron forms arguably the first super team of the 21st century and sets precedent. Heat have a pretty easy run to the final, but again get dismantled by western opposition and lose 4-2. Lebron averages 17.7 ppg and is mostly pretty bad.  This is the only outright bad thing of his career I would not really try to defend it. Other then saying that Mavs team does get horribly under rated as we only look at this series as the LeBron collapse.   &gt;2012 - Lebron now in his prime at 27, wins his first ring against a very young OKC team 4-1 in a lockout shortened season.  He was awesome, and beat an amazing young team. Lockout or not great win.   &gt;2013 -heat narrowly win a 4-3 ECF series vs a young and beatable pacers team. Heat again narrowly win the finals after a series saving shot by ray allen. Series win be characterised as being won by the roleplayers. Most accounts say Spurs were the better team and it was theirs to lose.   That Pacers team was fantastic and built really well. Let's not forget the years on Roy Hibbert being a defensive beast at the rim. Also LeBron I believe dominated Game 6,7 of that Spurs series and clawed them back in game 6. So ya Allen hit the shot, but they were in that game cause of LeBron.   &gt;2014 - Heat are again taken to 7 by a young and beatable Pacers team. An ageing spurs and late 30s Tim Duncan Don’t make the same mistake as last year and dismantle the heat 4-1 quite embarrassingly. Puts last years narrow loss into perspective.  That Spurs team was built perfectly. The aging Dwade along with a poor supporting cast built so much stress on LeBron. I do agree this series should go longer considering his greatness, but that Spurs team was just amazing.   &gt;2015 - lebron leaves Heat after 4 years and goes to Cavs with the intention of forming another super team with Kyrie and others. Cavs get a modest 52 wins, which would have put them 7th in the west. A good series vs a much better team and Lebron’s cavs lose 4-2.  KLove, and Kyrie were injured in the finals. Hard to beat a great Warriors team that won 67 games, when your second best player is Tristan Thompson. Iggy got the finals MVP for just guarding LeBron. This similar to 2007 I don't see how anyone can shit on him for.   2016 - another 4-3 win after big momentum shift due to Kyrie irving heroics and other roleplayers. Again by most accounts, Similar to 2013 Spurs series, it was GSWs to lose and they did.  He was amazing in this series. I don't see how anyone can really take coming back from a 3-1 lead in the finals against a person, but you somehow did lmao.   &gt;2017 - similar to 2014, GSW made it right and dismantled Cavs for a 4-1 victory. Putting into perspective last years loss 2018 - 4-0 GSW, 2nd sweep of his career in finals  Lumped these together, cause for the love of god look at that Warriors team. Hard to beat it. Especially in 2018 without your second best player.  &gt;2019 - no AD, Lakers don't qualify for the playoffs.  He was injured and that Lakers team was meh. They make the playoffs if he's healthy all year, but that team was not good enough to be anything more then a second round exit at most.    &gt;2020 - Beat the Miami heat 4-2 for his 4th ring. Led by example and played well throughout the series, massively supported by AD.  Ad was awesome, but so was LeBron. A ring is a ring. Jordan needed Scottie to be great. The fact AD was also great does not take away from his greatness.   &gt;2021 - AD injured, Lebron led Lakers are a first round exist.  Injury riddled season. The suns were a better team possibly even without the injuries.   I personally think LeBron is the best player ever. But, I have 0 reason to argue that Jordan is not the best. You can fully think what you want. But, let's not just shit on him for minimal reasons without adding context. If you switched their careers we'd be doing the same thing to Jordan. Just look at these players as great."
"hey chris!  during your career, who was one player (could be from past or present) that you've always wanted to play with? im asking this because are a 7th grader wanting to become a pro basketball player, ive always wanted a few teammates ive wanted to play with. like kyrie irving, bradley beal, larry bird, etc."
Kyrie Irving was never a #1 on a good team and is a defensive liability. Bosh carried the Raptors to the playoffs twice and affects the game in way more areas than Kyrie. Kyrie can score. Every other part of his game is mediocre or worse.
"Harden is good at both. personally still dont think hes as good of a ceiling raiser than durant. Harden works well on this team because durant is excelent off ball and very good defensively still. Kyrie has also been decently good off ball and attacking quickly when he gets it.   Harden isnt effective off ball that much, he obviously provides great spacing but his work rate off ball is low. you're not gonna get harden coming off a screen for a jumper or crashing the boards for offensive rebounds.   So this team mostly works imo because of how malleable durant is and how irving has adjusted his game. Harden essentially hasnt adjusted his game at all outside of shooting less and passing more. You can see how harden and westbrook didnt work that well as proof of how if you put harden next to another limited ball dominant star he can't really be that effective in the other aspects of the game.  Now this concept doesnt necessarily matter here. Lebron is an example of someone who actually is the same way a bit. lebron was always a much better defender, and better off ball too with his cuts/screening/offensive rebounding but wasnt that great overall because of his lacck of shooting."
"Dwayne Wade, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love... He's had some of the best teammates of any player in NBA history."
Any team with Kyrie Irving as their 3rd best player isn't losing before finals. I'm convinced you could replace the entire Nets bench with clones of Schroeder and they're still winning this series.
"Do you understand how good a top 20 player all time is? You legitimately think both Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving are better than player like Dr J, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnet, Dirk etc?"
bucks in 7  kryie blames everyone.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/02/nets-kyrie-irving-were-uniting-the-whole-world-with-this-championship-run/
Uhhh Kyrie Irving?
"So, after the incident that happened with the fan and him being charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon I wondered why. I talked to some legal experts around the country why the fan was charged with that for cbs news. Here’s the link to the articles https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/kyrie-irving-cole-buckley-assault-water-bottle/?__twitter_impression=true"

"Holy cow, you dug through a lot of comments about Survivor! Congratulations! If it wasn’t obvious that I hate the Lakers, I apologize.  And yeah, I would considered both years “squandered.” From 2011 to 2018, every LeBron team made the finals. He is capable of greatness, even when they’re injured players on his team.  In 2015, LeBron took two games off the Warriors in the Finals without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. The second best Cavalier in that series was Matthew Dellavadova! That is how you get the most out of a unlucky LeBron season! The 2021 Lakers team didn’t lose talent of that level. And even Post-AD injury, the 2018 Cavaliers had a worse supporting group than the 2021 Lakers and those Cavs still managed to make the finals. Dropping two all stars is more significant than the Lakers injuries this year. Simply put, this Lakers team was a bust. You had LeBron, who might the best ever, and couldn’t get out of the first round. If that’s not wasting talented, nothing is."
"RIP Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, and Anthony Davis"
"2016 Cavs was not weak by any means. They had Kyrie Irving playing at an MVP level in the finals. That's pretty big.  6 Finals appearances might be unimpressive, but 6 winning championships is very impressive. Jordan didn't just make it to 6, he WON 6. That's very impressive.  It is a debate, that's why I have LeBron at #2 all time. We're debating right now aren't we?"
"I know World B. Flat is a pretty good nickname for Kyrie.  But I got a new one.  Kyrie ""Giraffe Pussy"" Irving.  Coz he's that high."
"No fucking way. Please no. Just fire Pat Riley if he pulls this move, no one can tell me Heat Culture™ can turn Schröder around. He doesn't even fit, he's too old to align perfectly with Bam and he's a streaky shooter and another bad guard defender. Our center can guard Kyrie fucking Irving but none of our guards can guard a bag of rice."
Kyrie Irving mixed with a little bit of Uncle Ted Kaczynski  &gt; The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government. I saw it on an IG Live by @ThirdEyeMemes
"never really cared about the bucks at all even if Giannis is an amazing player to watch  that said... GO BUCKS!  you will never convince me there is a bigger POS in the NBA than Kyrie fucking Irving, and also fuck that snake KD and fatty james harden. hope  the nets crash and burn, so im rooting for any teams they face. teams dont usually piss me off (except clippers), but this nets team is just SO easy to root against"
Marv Albert has mistaken me for this dickhead Kyrie Irving. It seems logical because Kyrie also plays for the Nets and in fact does the exact same thing I do.
"It's funny all the people who were calling the Lakers ""lucky"" because CP3 got hurt completely ignoring how lucky the Suns are that Cam Payne decided to start playing like his name is Kyrie Irving"
"Lol why are you sweatin it? Your position is just as locked in, you’re a hardcore kyrie Irving fan bro"
"Kyrie ""Robin Forever"" Irving"
"Nothing after that trade? He hired Stevens, traded for IT and Crowder who he eventually flipped into Kyrie Irving, signed Horford and Hayward, drafted Brown when he was not a consensus pick at that spot and wanted Tatum over Fultz and Ball who were seen as consensus top 2. That's of the most impressive rebuilds in NBA history transitioning from the Big 3 era. It may not have worked out perfectly and the last 2 off-seasons were disastrous but you can't rewrite this as just one good trade. With a little better health and personality luck they'd have likely been a serious contender."
I haven’t read the article but I’m gonna guess that it’s because he threw a water bottle at Kyrie Irving.
Is there a whinier fanbase in sports than Lakers fans? Their incessant bitching about those billboards and marketing slogans might be worse than the whining from Celtics fans about Kyrie Irving and their stupid ass mascot
"THE NETS ARE OFFICIALLY CITY CHAMPS, CONGRATS TO KEVIN DURANT, KYRIE IRVING AND JAMES HARDEN ON THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT"
yes kyrie irving with his 0 minutes in the last three games was super helpful
"I actually made a typo lol. Kevin Durant had FOUR all-stars on his team (James Harden, Blake Griffin, Kyrie Irving, and DeAndre Jordan)."
How is it not a Super team with two MVPs. 6 time all star Blake Griffin. Best 3 point shooter in the NBA Joe Harris. Just because Kyrie Irving wasn't playing in games 4 5 and 6.
"The Bucks beat a team that was put together by KD and was suppose to be unbeatable in the playoffs. Team chemistry cannot be put together, it has to be create by each team member contributing. Nets do not play as team and that was their downfall. Kyrie Irving is a worthless individual and will never be a winner because he only play for himself. He abandons his teammates for personal party time! Maybe someday teams owners will prevent Irving from joining thier locker rooms to destroy the team atmosphere and character!"
Kyrie Irving is like 60 in a 15 year old body.
Kyrie “Anthony ‘Street Clothes’ Davis” Irving
You really trying to compare the loss of DiVin-fucking-cenzo to the loss of Kyrie Irving?
https://www.si.com/nba/2018/05/28/kyrie-irving-game-7-absence-celtics-deviated-septum-surgery
"I assure you you wouldn’t beat Ben Simmons in a shootout. The 3pt line is farther back than normal, I’ve seen him consistently make 3s in multiple videos of him practicing.   You sure probably just stop talking before you embarrass. Also for your friend beating marrow I would bet money that he wasn’t trying since it’s a training camp. There’s no reason for him to try. I could say my friend who was 12 years old at the time scored on kyrie Irving, that doesn’t mean kyrie is fucking ass that just means that kyrie didn’t want to fuck up a 12 year old.  Theirs a reason why you and your friend aren’t in the NBA."
"You'll run it back, and never win anything.  You've invested your franchise's entire capital in this run, which include perennially injured players, and weak minded individuals who quit on their teams.  After the next 2 years are over, after you constantly will have to dodge injury and non injury related craziness (Kyrie Irving), you will have nothing to show for it.  You'll spend the next 10 years rebuilding draft capital, and eating albatross contracts until you can compete again.  And you deserve it."
He Zaza Pachulied Kyrie Irving. I wouldn't be surprised if the bucks win the chip. They seemed favored by the league and you have to make giannis resigning with a small market appear like a great decision. Ps....this is a billion dollar business. They are going to do what is best for business
"Nothing makes me happier than knowing that Kyrie Irving will be going home early in the playoffs, again."
Bro it’s a joke.  I can guarantee you that the leprechaun didn’t curse kyrie irving.

"sure, if by ""a lot of help"" you mean ""a healthy James Harden and/or Kyrie Irving"""
"Don't care. People trash LeBron for it so if KD is ""the best player in the world"" he doesn't get a free pass. He left OKC to go win with a 73-9 team. Now he's on another team with kyrie Irving and James harden. With them out the picture, it was his moment to prove he can get it done. And he failed."
Nets missing Kyrie Irving (their 3rd best player) and Dinwiddie while Bucks without Donte DiVincenzo and Jordan Nwora seems just like superteam vs last years 1 seeds with injuries to me. Nets still got 2 MVPs on the court.
It was to fix residual damage from his facial fracture.   https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kyrie-irving-attend-game-due-deviated-septum-surgery/story?id=55489108  Lol stay classy Boston.
News from the future:  Kyrie Irving won't be there next year's playoffs either at some critical moment.

I’m loving the Celtics fans piling on the Kyrie hate. As a heat and also LeBron fan I too want to partake.   As the guys from PTI say: Kyrie Irving is the most miserable person in professional sports
"Kyrie ""He was phenomenal before he got injured"" Irving"
If Irving/harden healthy Durant doesn’t go for 50 tonight. It’s tough to know. They played so little together this year.   On paper - yes. But bucks have had the same general team for years. The chemistry is something you can’t overlook. So I don’t feel comfortable saying nets game 7 barely lose + kyrie + healthy harden = win nets  Although certainly it’s favorable. But to just chalk it up like you are as a guarantee is oversight
"When you win against a team with offensive monsters on steroids in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving ang slugging it out until game 7 which you forced by having to win a Game 6, celebrating that precious win is a way to release all that stress and tension of almost losing it all. Just look at how everything was on a knife's edge. What a relief for those Bucks fans!"
"Kyrie ""A lot of help"" Irving"
"Bruh they have KD and their offensive talent is more than enough to at least compensate for Kyrie Irving, and they had the Bucks on the ROPE in Game 3."
With all due respect to Donte but he’s nowhere near losing the caliber of player that are kyrie irving or a healthy James Harden
"That's what you get with Kyrie Irving. Call up Lebron, he can tell you."
With a healthy kyrie irving
This went down to the last shot with Kyrie Irving injured most of the series.  The Nets clearly win in 6 with him healthy. They’re clearly the better team.
Donte Divencenzo vs. Kyrie Irving and half of Harden is a wash? Clown
Lebron &gt; Kyrie Irving
"As usual, Kyrie Irving proved to be unreliable."
KD had James harden &amp; kyrie Irving on his team bro shut the fuck up 🤣🤣🤣 y’all are so desperate for KD to be compared all time to LeBron
The universe won't let Kyrie Irving win.
"dont build anything with Kyrie Irving, you will fail"
"Kyrie Irving to KD after this game: ""what does a second round exit mean to you?"""
"Kyrie Irving is another ""Street clothes"" player."
Kyrie Megamind Irving
"Kyrie Irving &amp; Tatum both lived/live in West Newton, you're an absolute clown. Take your ball and go home to Detroit."
Sometimes you’ve gotta Kyrie Irving
lmao this reads like something kyrie irving would say
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-kyrie-irving-calls-out-young-teammates-after-loss-to-magic/  ""The young guys don't know what it takes to be a championship level team,"" Irving said, via Keith Smith of Real GM. ""What it takes every day. And if they think it is hard now, what do they think it will be like when we're trying to get to the Finals?"""
"you know what here's one for you to interpret.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/11/12/18086792/kyrie-irving-quotes-celtics-vets  We’re not as good as we think we are,” Irving said. “That’s what it comes down to.”  “Right now I think it would be nice if we had someone that was a 15-year vet” Irving said. “A 14-year vet that could kind of help us race along the regular season and understand it’s a long marathon rather than just a full-on sprint.”   This is SB nation of course so not sure what your media preferences are"
[The handful being the Celtics?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10006208-report-celtics-saw-lack-of-reaction-to-kyrie-irving-stomping-logo-as-a-red-flag)
I would trade Gobert for Kyrie Irving. Helps both teams
"I think the Celtics main issue was that the Nets had Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden all playing while the Celtics were missing Jaylen Brown. Was Tatum not showing enough competitive spirit when he scored 50 points in a playoff game?"
&gt; several team sources suggest the Celtics’ culture of competition is eroding — **with more than one source pointing to the players’ perceived indifference toward Kyrie Irving stomping on the Celtics logo after the final home game of the season as a red flag they did not exhibit the same sense of pride in the organization** that has been the Celtics’ calling card in years past.  Big Baby Davis would never 😤😤😤
"I can do one even better   &gt;Smart has long been a favorite of both Stevens and predecessor Danny Ainge, even as Ainge was reportedly exploring trades for Smart. Despite the continuity in leadership, several team sources suggest the Celtics’ culture of competition is eroding — with more than one source pointing to the players’ perceived indifference toward Kyrie Irving stomping on the Celtics logo after the final home game of the season as a red flag they did not exhibit the same sense of pride in the organization that has been the Celtics’ calling card in years past."
"this to me is the best part here my god lmao   &gt;Smart has long been a favorite of both Stevens and predecessor Danny Ainge, even as Ainge was reportedly exploring trades for Smart. Despite the continuity in leadership, several team sources suggest the Celtics’ culture of competition is eroding — with more than one source pointing to the players’ perceived indifference toward Kyrie Irving stomping on the Celtics logo after the final home game of the season as a red flag they did not exhibit the same sense of pride in the organization that has been the Celtics’ calling card in years past."
"The Lopez comparison is kinda unfair for a few reasons:  1.	Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden 2.	He actually punishes the Nets inside consistently but Bud insists on not feeding him the ball 3.	He’s old"
"Yep, I’d say so as well, though less so if he manages to win a championship without James Harden and Kyrie Irving."
They made Reggie Jackson look like Kyrie Irving
"They were bad moves because they were overpaid, even for their ‘16 performance, and then subsequently went on to drastically and rather expectedly (especially in JR’s case because everyone and their mother knew he was streaky, and TT had pretty much only had one really impactful season)underperform even their ‘16 performance and almost (JR was good in ‘17 tbf but was still overpaid) instantly became bad untradeable contracts. For the production they gave them, they could have gotten a lot cheaper players as defending champions with Lebron James and Kyrie Irving under contract for the next 2 seasons at least. People don’t traditionally go to Cleveland as free agents, but Cleveland are also not traditionally defending champions with their three top players under contract so that’s a bit of a mute point. Lebron pushed two bad moves in the heat of a cap spike, just like Portland’s front office who‘ve been crucified for it for years."
"He's a great coach. Gotta him credit for making the right adjustments and allowing his team to stay within the moment, even as adversity hits.  While its great to have players like Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love on your roster, he was able to put it all together to make it all work out. At least so far in these playoffs."
Then why haven’t they [ruled him out](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2021/6/18/22540761/kyrie-irving-ruled-out-of-game-7-injury-not-deemed-season-ending-says-steve-nash)?
"last time i checked, kyrie irving was african american"
 * The Bucks blew a 17 point lead against a Nets team without Kyrie Irving and a one-legged James Harden.     * The 76ers blew a 26 point lead to the the Atlanta Hawks and failed a score a FG in the last 4 minutes at home in front of AI and Dr. J     Those two games pale in comparison to what the Utah Jazz managed to pull off tonight.
Kyrie Irving
"Elaborating on the All NBA stuff, I’ll try to explain this to the best of my ability. Tatum received All NBA votes as both a guard and as a forward. He actually got enough overall votes to make the third team over Kyrie Irving but was classified as a forward because he received the most votes there. He didn’t get enough votes to edge out any of the forwards on the third team and as such didn’t make the third team. Apologies if that’s poorly explained, I don’t fully understand the situation myself."
"AD also had LeBron James. Thinking that AD is more valuable than Tatum is utterly insane when Tatum is 5 years younger and just had 2 50 point games in the postseason beating James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving while the Celtics were missing 3 starters including 2 stars and Timelord who has all-nba level impact statistics like 3rd in the league in WS/48 and 11th in the league in BPM."
"Well they traded walker out but if you look at the other 3 separately it makes sense, kyrie is probably always leaving to play with KD but it was a gamble for 2 years of Irving and it didn’t work out. Horford got a huge over pay from philly and Hayward just couldn’t stay healthy(if he doesn’t roll his ankle in the 1st round last year maybe they’re in the finals). Zach Lowe and Windhorst went over this like 2 weeks ago, windhorst said ainge failed because he never cashed in all those picks for a star and lost all these guys in free agency and Zach pushed back and they went over it 1 by 1 and covered all the trades Danny tried to make to get stars(Jimmy butler and PG)"
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.    Past 10 drafts  2010 Best Players  * John Wall (1)  * DeMarcus Cousins (5)  * Gordan Hayward (9)  * Paul George (10)   2011 Best Players  * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * Jimmy Butler (30)  2012 Best players  * Anthony Davis (1)  * Bradley Beal (3)  * Damien Lillard (6)  * Draymond Green (35)  * Khris Middleton (39)  2013 Best players  * Victor Oladipo (2)  * Giannis Anteokoumpo (15)  * Rudy Gobert (27)  2014 Best Players  * Joel Embiid (3)  * Julius Rangle (7)  * Zach Lavine (13)  * Nikola Jocic (41)  2015 Best Players  * Karl Anthony Towns (1)  * D'Angelo Russell (2)  * Devin Booker (13)  2016 Best players  * Ben Simmons (1)  * Brandon Ingram (2)  * Jaylen Brown (3)  * Domantas Sabonis (11)  * Pascal Siakam (27)  2017 Best players  * Jayson Tatum (3)  * De'Aron Fox (5)  * Donovan Mitchell (13)  * Bam Adebayo (14)  * John Collins (19)  2018 Best players  * Deandre Ayton (1)  * Luca Doncic (3)  * Trae Young (5)  * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)  2019 Best Players  * Zion Williamson (1)  * Ja Morant (2)  2020 Best Players  * La Melo Ball (3)
"I don’t know why you guys care about NBA players saying dumb shit.   JJ Redick said he doesn’t believe in dinosaurs. Kyrie Irving is a flat earther. KD is a 5%er.   These guys are authorities on how to put a ball in a basket, nothing more."
"He already does a lot well for a 21-year-old, plus he is 7'2.   Celtics were not going to compete for anything with 6'6-6'8 guys playing at Center. Not in a division that has KD, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam, Kyrie Irving, &amp; Ben Simmons.   I get that small ball is the trend right now, but the Celtics need a guy who will make elite players like those guys that think twice about driving to the hoop.   Tacko is tall, but got into basketball really late and it shows because he's still very green.   They needed some true bigs that could come in &amp; play right away. And Stevens should sign Brown to a contract that's more in line with a late first round pick to keep him around."
"So in a way, they turned Terry Rozier, Al Horford, Kyrie Irving,.Lbs Walker, Gordon Hayward and a first round pick into older Al Horford.   NEAT"
You’re telling me you wouldn’t trade an injured PG for Kyrie Irving?  30/30 teams make that trade.

Celtics can only hire a black coach at this time. Danny Ainge and Kyrie Irving brought it upon them. They are waiting for Chauncey Billiups.
"Do you know how hard it is to get good at &lt;insert-job-description-here&gt;  A guy like Linus Torvalds has changed the entire planet and gets no recognition for it, meanwhile flat earther Kyrie Irving makes millions by choosing to stay home or come to work whenever he wants to.  Basketball players do not work harder than anybody else out there.  A lower-class single mother with 3 kids works harder than anybody out there."
Traded Baron Davis and a first round pick for Mo fucking Williams. That first round pick? Kyrie Irving
As yes missing Kyrie Irving and a 25% healthy James Harden is equal to missing Dante DiVincenzo…
"You said LeBron isn't good together with another ball-dominant player. LeBron won a championship with D.Wade almost 9 years ago, which has made your point moot at exactly that point in time. It was quite a common point until then. He also won another championship with Kyrie Irving another few years ago, which makes your point even more dense. Being antagonistic towards somebody for discussing in a meme format on Reddit is great as well. If you want serious discussion hop onto /r/nbadiscussion, though they would laugh you out of the subreddit with your take.   MJ didn't start winning championships until he had another HoF-player and elite role players that complemented him either, does he have nothing to offer to a team as well? And for the record, I still rank MJ as the GOAT."
dude all those words don't mean shit since kyrie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donte  donte is way more replaceable than Kyrie fucking Irving who gives af about team schemes kyrie is an all nba talent lol
"Lol objectively speaking, winning a series because you were lucky enough to face a gutted opponent doesn't change the facts of the matter. If you were gonna fire him for losing in 5, you shouldn't really change your mind just because they Nets suffered another injury that allowed them to win the series. He didn't magically become better just because the Bucks were able to beat a Nets team with Kyrie Irving out and James Harden on half a hamstring."
Is kyrie Irving the most important net? Find out tomorrow on undisputed.
Kyrie Irving?
The NBA IS BANNING CRITICAL RACE THEORY BECAUSE OF KYRIE IRVING!!!!
Paul George and Kyrie Irving are A-Tier.
"KD isn't gay, but he wants to live in a log cabin in the woods with Kyrie Irving. They won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as KD stands in the kitchen window watching Kyrie play 2k and lift weights.  KD will run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing himself to think of women while his thoughts drift back to Kyrie. He won't be able to climax and he'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes they will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but they both deny themselves and go back to what they were doing.  One day one of them will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"I'll be grateful for KD joining us, but damn if this guy isn't the most insecure basketball player I've ever seen.  And fuck you Kyrie ""Littlefinger"" Irving"
"He’s actually a pretty normal dude. My sister had her 21st birthday at a popular karaoke bar in Los Angeles, and we had a big group. I was set to go last, but as I was walking to the stage, a man in a hooded sweatshirt and hat asked if he could perform. I absolutely hate signing, so I was happy to oblige. For the next 15 minutes, Kyrie Irving performed poetry slam about the the government using birds as a means of controlling society. Everyone in the venue was so moved, my sister’s boyfriend captured a pigeon outside, and Kyrie decapitated it on stage"
"I'm not denying Donte's impacting is being missed. I'm pointing out that his injury is way less jarring in terms of costing a team a championship than like Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, and Mike Conley"

They were all hallucinating boston fans thinking the court was kyrie Irving/s
"It was actually a pretty big talking point at the time because the Cavs still had LeBron and Kyrie Irving was demanding a trade. Chauncey has also been regularly interviewing for coaching jobs and front office positions, just like Ime Udoka, and Becky Hammon have these last few coaching cycles. He's been pretty relevant and up for higher profile jobs than this one."
"Ask John Collins, Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving？"
"What do you mean by legit, are they legit contenders? yes. If Giannis is out for the series and they make the finals, did they benefit from injuries to key superstars Kyrie Irving and Giannis? also yes."
Some where Kyrie Irving is saying “Karma is motha” to Giannis.
Anthony Davis  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Donovan Mitchell  Joel Embiid  Mike Conley  Jaylen Brown  Chris Paul  ---  No Trae or Jamal Murray
See: Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving is the next Kobe…
The Nets will be better off going forward if they trade Kyrie Irving for solid role players
Kyrie Irving for Ben Simmons would be a good trade
"Kyrie Irving is soft as hell and overrated compared to the upper echelon of the league. He has never been the consistent best player on a team, which was the fake reason he pushed his way out of Cleveland. Year after year he plays when he wants then gets injured when it matters the most."
"Really not true.   It’s the same perception as calling players in bad teams “good stats bad team”. You think any coach can make an adjustment when he was the Hawks against a Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love championship Cavs? How about the fact if they beat the Raptors in 2019 they likely beat the Warriors as well (assuming everything else is equal).   You can’t say “Bud actively puts his team at a disadvantage” when he has consistently had his team completely but in to every role that they have been assigned, and they are favourited to win it all this year."
He’s doubled teamed every time he touched the Ball. The Knicks figured out how to play zone within those rules. Now any coach can say Ill just play a zone. Back then you had to be very detailed to pull off playing a helping defense which the eastern conference teams did. There are 12 year old right now who don’t know how insane Miami Lebron was who are saying Kyrie Irving is better than him. I can’t wait for the day they get to their keyboards and spread their ignorant opinions all over this sub. You didn’t watch the games then so you can’t know.
Kyrie Irving is a misunderstood genuis. The Kanye West of basketball
Kyrie Irving is way way way overrated. If he didn't have the one ring from 2016 he would be considered a meh player
Kyrie Irving is on 30.000 ft a few times a week. He does not believe in the flat earth.
"Kyrie Irving missed the '15 Finals, the '18 ECF, the '20 playoffs, and now '21 Semis with injuries.  It's like the Lakers losing a game by 3 and saying ""if only Shaq didn't miss 6 free throws""."
"and giannis literally *personally* injured kyrie irving. whether it was intentional or not, he personally undercut him. and that's why they won. just sayin"
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R. Smith|40.0|35.6| |Tristan Thompson|63.6|0| |Richard Jefferson|51.6|16.7| |Kevin Love|30.4|26.7| |Iman Shumpert|26.3|16.7|  OKC  |Player||| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|42.3|28.6| |Russell Westbrook|39.5|31.7| |Serge Ibaka|47.2|34.4| |Dion Waiters|35.8|31.8| |Andre Roberson|52.0|44.4| |Steven Adams|53.3|0| |Enes Kanter|48.6|0|"
"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters. You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure. But compare it to the Cavs squad in the playoffs.   |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|52.5|34.0| |Kyrie Irving|47,5|44.0| |J.R. Smith|43.6|43.0| |Kevin Love|38.5|41.4| |Tristan Thompson|52.7|0| |Richard Jefferson|52.4|39.3| |Iman Shumpert|41.7|38.2| |Channing Frye|59.4|56.5|"
Kyrie Irving as well.
"This post just reminded me that everyone always talks about Lebron during that 2016 NBA Finals, but I swear to god, I felt like games 5-7, Kyrie Irving torched us and hit the biggest shot at the end of Game 7."
Kyrie Irving is way too high. Kyrie Irving cannot lead a team far in the playoffs.
Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving were scrubs? Good lord
"In that case, why not put Kyrie Irving at center?"
"Danny ""[I've never had a player complain about racism""](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/5/28/22457604/danny-ainge-kyrie-irving-racism-boston-celtics-nets-comments) Ainge"
"I think the implosion was in large part situational, as in I think both pressure on Ben Simmons from the Philly side and the Hawks being an unusually bad match-up for Simmons made him look worse than he is. The Sixers were a shot away from winning game 1, an injury (albeit to Embiid) away from winning game 5, and a few free throws away (albeit from Ben Simmons) from winning game 3 (I think I got the number right), and if we imagine them coming up against the Bucks, but particularly the Nets, who despite injuries to Kyrie Irving and James Harden were an inch of KD's toes away from winning game 7, Simmons would have been absolutely indispensable to the Sixers' chances in the Conference Finals. His value would be very clear in a series against either KD or Giannis.  Also, in Philly, he was often the second scoring option, basically unless Seth Curry was hot. Minnesota has what he lacks (KAT for shooting from a big, DLo for a playmaker who has the threat of just pulling up) and he has what Minnesota lacks, a good secondary ball-handler, good defense to cover for KAT or DLo depending on opposition, and good passing out of the interior. If you could get him for Ricky Rubio and some young guards/wings that already sit behind Anthony Edwards and Dlo and would sit behind Simmons too if they stayed, doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world.  But I'm a Knicks fan. I'm the kind of person who thought it was realistic that KD, Kawhi, and Demarcus Cousins were coming in 2019. So what do I know lol."
Kyrie Irving by accident lol.
"You *can't* use players that won titles? You're kinda fucking us here but let's give it a go:  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Antoine Walker  C: Bob McAdoo?  Reggie Lewis vs Jaylen Brown was tough for me, but we never really got to see Reggie's prime. I also *wanted* to put IT here, especially considering how Kyrie's Celtics tenure went, but I can't really argue that IT was the better player. We only had Bob McAdoo for 20 games, but he was still pretty damn good that year, so fuck it, it counts. He's better than Ed Macauley."
"I iant saying Okoro is the next Kawhi, but as a 19 year old kid he guarded literally every single All-Star night in and night out and held most of them to well below average scoring and play.    https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/04/isaac-okoro-undaunted-after-defending-gauntlet-of-nba-stars-including-stephen-curry.html   “But Isaac makes you beat him. He doesn’t give you angles, he doesn’t go for steals and get out of position. He makes you have to score over the top of him, and I thought he did a great job of that in the first half for sure.”  Harden’s attempts to get past or around the stout Okoro were to no avail, so much that he didn’t even take a shot until a minute and 25 seconds into the second quarter.   “It was impressive from the young fella,” said Taurean Prince, who scored a season-high 17 points in his Cavs debut. “Usually you see guys kinda get happy feet guarding those caliber of players, but he was staying solid and sticking to his principles. Definitely stuck to the game plan. He definitely looked well-prepared and focused out there, and that’s truly all you can ask (for) out of the young guy.”  Of course, Harden is not going to be held down for very long. He found some success in the second-half and overtime periods, and ended up dropping 21 points (along with recording his third consecutive triple-double for the Nets). With that said, when you look at the shots he made, he didn't actually score on Okoro until the 3:28 mark in the fourth quarter.  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-isaac-okoro-swarms-james-harden-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-defense  Pre All-Star break, a span of time consisting of 31 games, Okoro averaged a mere 8.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Not exactly encouraging numbers for a top five pick averaging 33.2 minutes a game up to that point.  Post All-Star break, the rook has scored at a rate of 10.6 points per game, adding 3.4 rebounds and is still dishing out just 1.9 assists. What’s more? Okoro is having a great month of May as through seven games, he is posting about 16.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists.  “Ice,” as he is often referred to, showcased exactly what he is capable of in a May 4 matchup against the Phoenix Suns (currently the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference) in which he exploded for a career-high 32 points while defending two of the game’s best in Chris Paul and Devin Booker.  He did a bit of everything offensively as he hit 10-of-16 of his field goal attempts and shot three-of-four from three-point range while also going nine-of-nine from the free throw line.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/05/14/cleveland-cavaliers-should-isaac-okoro-make-one-all-rookie-teams/"

"Nobody is killing for 2018 Kevin Love lol. You had one of James Harden or Kyrie Irving playing alongside KD every game, even if Harden wasn't great after injury."
 Roberson provides more floor spacing than Kyrie Irving. is that what you're tellling me?
that's very cute if you think Roberson provides the same spacing as Kyrie Irving. that's a L in itself
Lmao are you joking? LeBron with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love is the closest out of any player to carry a team ?
"I think Kyrie is an idiot for his thoughts on the flat earth, but the whole ""kids look up to him"" thing is bogus. If your kid grows up a flat-earther because of Kyrie Irving, then you royally messed up your job as a parent.  There's plenty of people who admire sports players but don't hang onto their every word outside of that respective sport."
If only Ozymandias knew about Kyrie Irving. Do many my lives could have been spared
"Yeah, like that 2014 World Cup team that consisted of scrubs like Steph Curry, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Derrick Rose, Paul George, and Kyrie Irving. To say they don't care is not totally accurate."
"I'm gonna go here, I blame Kyrie Irving for this loss. Ever since he declared the Nets big 3 was gonna be coaching as much as Steve Nash he highlighted the problem with USA stars.  They think they can just go one on one whenever they need a basket, they don't really need coaches, and they complain for calls too much."
"Why don't the US ever put a full strength team forward?? The arrogance of assuming any team we put out will win is astounding.  In 1992 NBA players were fighting for the opportunity to make the olympic team, but now players think it's not worth their time.  How can we call this an olympic level US team with no James Harden, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul or Bradley Beal?????  But instead we got Keldon Johnson, Javalle Mcgee and Draymond Green? Are you kidding me???"

"LeBron James, Steph curry, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant are all ahead of Luka and Giannis."
"This same exact block of text was written in 2004.   &gt;Yeah you can argue they are not as stacked as they could be  Folks seem to gloss over this as though it's an afterthought but this is how it's been for decades now. If Team USA doesn't send the best of the best, things can get variably dicey.   Everyone was convinced the world had not only caught up to the USA, but perhaps even surpassed them in the mid-2000's. Then when USA got their minds right and actually sent the cavalry the next time out (2008), we got original Dream Team types of results.   Circumstances are different this year because so many stars are out with injuries (as opposed to just opting out like they did in the 2000's). But you can't leave these guys at home...  * LeBron James  * Stephen Curry  * Anthony Davis  * Klay Thompson  * Kyrie Irving  * James Harden  * Donovan Mitchell   * Paul George  * Kawhi Leonard  ... and then turn around and casually be like, ""I know we didn't send our best but still."" There's literally a Dream Team sitting home and for a long time now, when those guys aren't in the fold, nothing's a sure thing."
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristian Thompson is about as good as Steph, Klay , and Dray"
"Kyrie Irving. My age is showing, but I saw his step back on Brandon Knight and have watched every game of his that I could ever since"
Fun fact. Book has 113 thirty point games. Kyrie Irving has 116.
Maybe kyrie Irving is a better comparison
"LeBron James - He’s like a father figure to Kyrie Irving already. If he can babysit Kyrie, he can babysit any kids. Plus he knows the Looney Tunes."
Anyone citing the LeBron help narrative is talking about how Kyrie Irving averaged like 30ppg in that series including a 41 point performance in the elimination game. I hate it when people say LeBron singlehandedly brought the Cavs back from 3-1 down.
"In no realm does a 37 year old LeBron, Anthony Davis, and 36 year old Kyle Lowry take on Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin Durant all in their primes. The offensive power is just too great, Lakers can’t match their shooting"
"watched kyrie irving give a... performance in the Disney XD show Kickin It when i was like 9, looked up his highlights and my jaw hit the floor"
Gilbert Arenas as a DC native he was electric and the first pro ball player not named Kobe or LeBron that I noticed as a kid.   Kyrie Irving and James Harden got me back into watching in 2018 because I loved their play styles
Pound for pound the best basketball player of all time MJ and Shaq attest. He has the best cross over of all time. A decent comp would be say take Westbrooks attitude and insanely high motor and put it inside kyrie Irving.
"So will a team with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden."
"Kyrie Irving. First saw his mixtapes in HS, then he looked good for a few games in college. Kept an eye on him and he was the coolest player I’ve ever seen his first few years on the Cavs. So much swagger and confidence, best highlights ever. When Lebron went to the Cavs me and my little brother were jumping up and down screaming with joy. Kyrie made me love basketball. The conspiracy stuff and him just being a general asshole really sucks to see because he made me love this sport."

"Why didn't anyone else survive the gauntlet? Milwaukee and Phoenix played multiple games without their best players. Depth and roster construction saved them. How's that luck? It's not like Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving getting hurt was a completely unlikely scenario.  Rather than trying to discredit them for being lucky, why aren't we saying the superteams were poorly constructed for being so top heavy?"
Kyrie irving
"&gt;Ben is likely going to be tiers better than anyone drafted at that spot.   We are having separate conversations then cz mine is the 4th pick has more value than Ben Simmons right now. Do you disagree with that?  Edit: here is the Kyrie no4 pick stuff i was talking about  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/03/kyrie-irving-lebron-james-cavaliers-suns-trade-talks   ""In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson."""
"Clippers: Kawhi is out for next season.  Lakers: Lebron James is going to turn 37 this year and Anthony Davis is injury prone.   Nets: The only team that's likely better than the Bucks. And that depends on their big 3 being healthy. I am a Bucks fan, so there's bias in this, but I genuinely don't think the Nets will be a Great team going forward. I think they're too glitzy and have too many non-basketball distractions. They're top heavy. Irving and Harden aren't known as being good teammates. The players seem to run the team as opposed to coaching and management. And Harden/KD/Kyrie haven't yet shown how they're gonna play together. There's an unusual vibe with this team and they haven't had a solid season of finding a style yet.  There's an asterisk for every NBA champion every season. There are always aberrations with injuries, fluke one-game performances, significant referee involvement in outcome, etc.   But every season's champion IS the champion. Flat out. The champion is always on the receiving end of most favorable or least unfavorable aberrations. To put it another way, skill is a huge part, but so is luck with the winning team generally having fewer injuries and competing teams having more injuries (among all the other factors).   ANd still, I kind of agree with you. I don't have any great confidence that the Bucks will win again next season. Not anywhere near the confidence I had in say, the Warriors, during their run where they seemed invincible. The Bucks aren't THAT good. But it's also a little premature to say they only won because of injuries and that they're not gonna win again. They deserve more respect than that. They earned that title."
"1. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both go to the Lakers 2. Chris Paul wants to go to the Lakers only to be turned down because of the salary cap issue and stays with the Suns instead 3. Lillard doesn't stay in Portland, but gets surprisingly traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown 4. Spencer Dinwiddle goes to the Clippers 5. The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the OKC thunder in exchange for Kemba and 2 first round picks and flip Tobias and those picks to the Blazers for CJ McCollum, Simons and Covington 6. Lonzo goes to the Bulls 7. Kawhi Leonard stays with the Clippers"
Kyrie Irving can dribble the basketball pretty damn well.
"Kd is a better defender than giannis, giannis just plays dirty and lunges at people (see: 1 kyrie irving)"
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, and Kawhi all went to LA and Brooklyn recently. Not to mention Kawhi left/forced his way out of 2 contenders to get to a specific city and he’s an impending free agent."
"bennet, Wiggins , leborn, kyrie irving... some franchises don't even get one top pick in their whole history."
Paul George for Kyrie Irving
"I say Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and AD. Great handles, shooting and defense. In the small 3×3 court they would be very effective."
NBA Heels team:  -	Kevin Durant -	James Harden -	Kyrie Irving -	Blake Griffin -	Patrick Beverly
"From 2004 to 2021, almost every injury asterisk is for a player whose name starts with K:  2004: Karl Malone  2009: Kevin Garnett  2010: Kendrick Perkins  2015: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving  2017: Kawhi Leonard  2019: Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant  2021: Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving"
"&gt;11 - Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Bump Kemba Walker for Nikola Vucevic for your starting 5.  Not saying Kemba is not as good as Vuc, but I am saying Kyrie, Klay, and Jimmy are better than Kemba and this lineup needs a big man, Vuc is a 2x all star."
It doesn't matter which team or how good they are at the playmaking / shot creating / etc. you add Kyrie Irving without hesitation
I'm a lifelong warriors fan but currently the only NBA jersey I own is a motor city Jennings piston jersey. Loved his high school mixtape and I remember in his like his 7th game dropped 55 on us. I always knew he wasn't necessarily in the upper upper echelon of PGs but his game is one of the all time most aesthetically pleasing to me. Kyrie Irving is Jennings gone super Saiyan.
"I’ve seen Steven Adams be Kyrie Irving in an off season video, I’ll believe it when I see it."
"Yeah mostly that. And also Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, both of whom were all stars that year. They were a really good team and defending champs for a reason"
"Yeah it must be so much easier beating prime LeBron, Kyrie Irving, and Love instead of an injured CP3 and a bunch of young guys. Definitely super hard road lmao"
Josh Smith Corey Brewer JR Smith Danual House Jr Ron Artest Dennis Rodman Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Nick Young Alex Caruso
"Again the people he checked, pestered and sometimes shut down this postseason:  James Harden   Kevin Durant   Jimmy Butler   Devin Booker   Trae Young   Lou Williams   Kyrie Irving   CP3  Some Revis Island shit right there."
I mean there are three I's in Kyrie Irving
"Bobby ""Two Eyes"" Portis &gt; Kyrie ""Third Eye"" Irving"
"Sports, on the athletes side, is the most free market economy on planet earth.  If you are one of the best 450 players in the world, you will make the NBA.   Its supply and demand.  There is a massive shortage of players who can perform at elite levels  Look at the NFL.  So many of these players are giant pieces of shit who beat women and yet still get paid millions because teams can't find a better player.     kyrie irving is a nightmare, yet any team would be thrilled to have him."
Kyrie irving got flipped hard once he went to boston and then got flipped hard again in boston.  KD warriors move went from being liked by most to absolutely destroyed.   Hardin regular season hardin post season..any season.  Curry 2016 back to back mvp unanimous cameback 3-1 to knock off okc and kd and then had a chance to put the injury thing to rest and take lebron throne quiet literally and win 73-9..didnt close them out 3-1. In alternate universe everything would b different if he did.
“5 time all star Blake Griffin” in 2021? What are we doing here?   “One of James harden and Kyrie Irving?” Did you even bother watching the games after harden came back? He had a torn hamstring! They almost lost to a team whose second best player could barely walk!
OP *is* Kyrie Irving
"James harden got injured 40 seconds into your series. Kyrie Irving got injured in game 4. Literally nobody gives a shit if Jabari Parker didn’t get hurt 5 years ago, we’re talking about the present day."
"You realize the Cavs were the favorites to win the title coming into the 15/16 season, right? Just as they were in 14/15. When they got the best PF in the NBA coming off averaging 26 and 12 and all-star guard Kyrie Irving. With Lebron being the best player in the NBA, they were def a superteam. Everybody shit on the Warriors 2015 championship claiming they got lucky and beat a bunch of injured teams. Nobody were calling the Warriors a great team coming into the 15/16 season. Crazy how narratives change lol. It's not even been more than 5 years."
"To put it in perspective, DDV - whose absence you appear to be treating as an afterthought - has an RPM that's not terribly far off Kyrie Irving's just by being a solid 3 and D shooting guard.  It's not that Irving isn't offensively great. He most certainly is. It's that he doesn't offer much for the other side.  The Bucks, on the other hand, are loaded with top tier defensive players all over the place. While they're not nearly as offensively gifted as the Nets are, they are pretty good, and add in the fact that they play great defense and it's a competitive matchup. The team is pretty similar to the one that was pacing peak Golden State Warriors on point differential before COVID blew up their season last year. The lost some depth and got a modest upgrade at the PG. They're a great team."
"Bucks propose Khris Middleton for Kyrie Irving, and the Nets take it just to watch Giannis leave"
"&gt; turns everybody else into spot up shooters    I thought this myth died out? Ah, yes, how could I be forgetting known spot-up shooters Kyrie Irving and Dwyane Wade?   That dude might be right, you probably don’t watch games"
"LeBron only went back because the Cavs finally had another decent player in the form of Kyrie Irving, who could potentially net him another championship. LeBron has always been an opportunist, nothing wrong with that, but being able to stick with the team through hard times like Giannis did, staying loyal to the process to win a championship is way more impressive."
"The difference most people use is that a Superteam is built by star players picking a team to join up on, a lot of times by forcing trades and lowering their trade value by saying they will only resign with select teams.   The Warriors before they got Kevin Durant were built through great drafting, player development, and asset management. The Bucks developed their two best players and put the rest of the team together with shrewd asset management. With Nets, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving both decided to team up and live in NY so they picked the Nets. Then James Harden hung out in strip clubs until he was traded to where he wanted to go.  The two processes are very different and most people tend to hold the homegrown success in higher regard."
This still makes no sense. Just because Pippen is a better defensive player does not make Wade okay at best. And because Pippen was ahead of Wade in a positional ranking doesn’t equal him being better.  That’s like if I said Kyrie Irving is an okay at best three point shooter because Steph Curry is better.
Yes it’s only trying to form a super team in one of them because the Nets already had Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the team. Apparently you understand perfectly.
"Kyrie Irving is a better 3 point shooter, mid range shooter, finisher at the rim, playmaker, and ball handler than Devin Booker. And any difference in defense is negligible."
He's not President of the Players union anymore. I believe it's Kyrie Irving.
"Say what you will about Bron and KD being better but non of them has done what only Giannis and Kawhi did, in the last 10 years or so.  They won without a Star teammate. They both had great teams with good basketball players but they weren't Steph Curry, DWade, Kyrie Irving or Anthony Davis."
"and it still just shows how much is random and how we will now put ""champion"" on giannis's legacy instead of playoff choker like we would have after round 2.  kyrie irving could be the most durable player ever, but if you land full force on someone's foot, you are probably out for the series.  if giannis gets hurt against the nets, we aren't talking.  if he gets hurt against a full strength hawks, we probably aren't talking.  but he got hurt when the other team also had their best player hurt.  there's injury luck and then there's what happened to phoenix and milwaukee this year.  we may never see anything like this again."
And it will be all him again next year. Kyrie is made of glass and will be injured when you need him most. The guy is amazing but he needs to consult his doctors and trainers. his bone density may be low idk. James harden has proven to be a no-show during important moments. The nets gm needs to have reliable replacements for those two before it's too late. I already love that British kid who subs in for Kyrie. He's like a carbon copy of Kyrie Irving. Spencer dimwiddie is returning so maybe there's hope for em after all
We really gonna discredit the bucks because they would've lost to a team with 2 top 5 players and Kyrie Irving?
"So is Kyrie Irving, but skill isn’t the same thing as impact and the Finals series Giannis just had is as good offensively as anything KD’s ever done."
He's kyrie Irving with a worse handle but a better mindset. Just a ridiculous shot maker.
I think Giannis got this champion is  so mean because he        make Kyrie Irving  hurt on purpose.
“And without that flake Kyrie Irving next time.”
Kyrie Irving who put up 40 in game 5 and hit the go ahead shot in 7.
That man is forgetting Kyrie Irving will dribble circles around any and every player in the league.
So the Bucks defeated the Nets heavily? Can you tell me what the finals score of game 7 was in overtime without Kyrie Irving and an unhealthy James Harden?
"""Fuck you Kyrie Irving"""
"Bucks Path to a Fraudulent Ring:  - **Round One:** Jimmy Butler historically bad  - **Round Two:** James Harden and Kyrie Irving go down  - **Round Three:** Trae Young goes down  - **Finals:** Chris Paul gets kidnaped in Game 5 and replaced by his twin Cliff Paul, and Devin Booker plays like the current Kobe, not the prime Kobe, in Game 6.  Smh win a real ring, Giannis."
The Nets will never have a normal Kyrie Irving anything. That's the fun of Kyrie Irving.
The Nets really were a normal Kyrie Irving landing from walking the playoffs huh?
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
"Bro you don’t have to agree with me. All I said was that it was excessive in my opinion. It is my opinion, meanwhile there’s PLENTY of people who share that sentiment (just google Kyrie and Giannis, you’ll see blogs, articles, videos by people saying the same). I get that you’re a Giannis fanboy and apparently can’t see things objectively.   There’s a whole article by the NY post about the injury the day after the game. And Here’s a quote from Jalen Rose from the article, “the NBA should give him a flagrant foul retroactively for not moving out from underneath Irving — a cardinal NBA sin.”  all I’m literally saying it was an excessive play imo. Obviously other people share the sentiment. , but I guess jalen rose doesn’t know basketball, only you do. And only you have right to have opinions lol   And Describe landing space? .. that’s like asking someone to describe how does 2 + 2 = 4"
Prediction: Lakers win 113-107 to force Game 7 in Brooklyn  LeBron James: 41/8/12  Anthony Davis: 34/11/5  Kevin Durant: 46/9/5  James Harden: 26/7/15  Kyrie Irving: 30/4/4
"&gt; If Giannis doesn’t box out Kyrie Irving on a floater while he is still mid air, encroaching on his landing space causing him to turn his ankle almost 90 degrees   This is also known as - goin for a rebound in the paint. Jesus fucking christ.   Love how none of these comments have the word Donte in them."
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Myles Turner would be an awesome team"
"Uh, there are most certainly players that DO NOT fuck with Chris Paul, and probably do not respect him. The same could be said of Kyrie Irving, who is currently the VP of the players association. Both of those guys have said and done plenty of dumb shit that falls into the same criteria you think league people are tilted about, yet somehow, CJs name is coming up nonetheless. So I guess his name does fit the description? Because he acts just like those guys?"
"Lots of indigenous people are big fans of basketball as well, maybe something like this would be the push to inspire the younger ones to keep grinding and make it to the league.   Only NBA player with indigenous roots that I can think of is Kyrie Irving rn."
"Lmao yeah Trae young, Damian Lilliard, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook. Yeah, shoot first really dying off. You’re the worst at this."
"The Bucks won, but that doesn’t mean there’s not a problem. We’re not far removed from:  - Kawhi leaving a championship team to go to LA - Kevin Durant leaving a finals team to go NYC - LeBron James leaving a finals team to go to LA  - Kyrie Irving leaving a top seeded team to go NYC - Paul George leaving a playoff team to go to LA  - James Harden leaving a playoff team to go to NYC - Anthony Davis tanking a season and  forcing his way off a team with Randle and Holiday to go to LA   Sure everyone had their own unique reason, but you have to admit there’s a pattern"
"As others have said, the nba is getting more position less.   But traditionally, it goes something like this  1-PG: your general ball handler. Kinda the quarterback of the team. Brings the ball up. Starts the plays. Prob your best passer. Kyrie Irving. Nash. Stockton.   2-SG: one of your best shooters. Smaller guys than the forwards and generally more of a playmaker. Kobe. Wade. Jordan.   3-SF: Your connector guy. Can do it all. Lebron. Pippin. Bird.   4-PF: big dudes that can move a bit. Barkley. Dirk.   5-C: your biggest guy. Guards the paint. Prob your worst shooter. Wilt. Ewing. Shaq.   But, as more and more players get more and more skills. These positions mix. 20 years ago a PF would never bring the ball up the floor. Today that’s pretty common."
rui hachimura and deni avdija for kevin durant and kyrie irving and jim harden. who says no?
team world.  can also get kyrie irving in since he was born in aus
"Depth. Patty Mills is a 6th man who only plays around 20 minutes anyways and is about to turn 33 years old. Everything that happened to the Nets this year is why they need a serviceable backup PG  Irving missed 20 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  Harden missed 30 regular season games and then games in the playoffs  They thought they didnt need a back up PG and it ended up biting them in the ass severely. Then they had to sign Mike James and play PG by committee.  This signing can take the work load off of Kyrie who has missed significant time the last 2 years and now they have Harden who is battling a hamstring. That type of injury tends to stay with athletes.  They just got rid of Shamet. Bruce Brown and Tyler Johnson are FAs.  Plus even if push came to shove and you needed to play all 3, that can easily be done in a small ball line up. Shit there are lineups that get thrown out there where KD could play the 5 or even BG against other teams."
"Sure you could argue Kyrie wasn’t.  Kevin love? 26.1/12.5/4.4 year before cavs. Come on don’t joke around.  Chris Bosh? 24/10.8/2.4 year before heat. Was raptors franchise player.   Pau Gasol? 20.4/8.9/4.6 on his best year on the grizzlies.  Hell every big man Lebron on lebrons super teams have been better than Pau.   Wade, Bosh, Irving, Love, AD, WB, Gasol, Bynum.  Go ahead and list these players in order on who’s best, I’m interested to see your list."

"Wade was stuck getting bounced in the 1st round or missing the playoffs every year after Shaq fell off and got traded to Phoenix while Chris Bosh couldn’t make the playoffs at all in Toronto, let alone win in the playoffs.   Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love couldn’t crack 35 wins on their respective teams before LeBron, let alone make the playoffs, let alone win in the playoffs.  Anthony Davis couldn’t make the playoffs in New Orleans, let alone win in the playoffs.  LeBron turned every one of them into champions within the 1st 2 seasons lmao. Chris Bosh missed the entire 2012 2nd round series against Indiana, missed 4 of the 7 games against Boston in the ECF, and was limited to 12 and 7 in only 25 mpg in the 3 games he did play in that series after returning from injury. They still won the East and ultimately the championship because LeBron was the best player in the league by far.  In 2013 Wade was having obvious knee issues through the whole playoff run. He averaged less than 14 points on below 37% shooting in round 1 vs Milwaukee, averaged less than 13 points in round 2 against the Bulls, and averaged less than 16 ppg on below 44% shooting in the ECF vs. Indy. Bosh averaged 11 points and 4 rebounds on less than 38% shooting in that same ECF vs Indy. They still won the East and ultimately the championship against one of the best teams of all time in the Spurs because LeBron was the best player in the league by far. They won the finals against the Spurs in the minutes that Wade was on the bench in favor of Ray Allen.   But yes, LeBron was one “cockriding” them and not the other way around. Can’t make this shit up lol. I didn’t even get into the part where Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder in round 1 of the 2015 playoffs and they still rampaged to the finals without him only for Kyrie to get hurt in game 1 of the finals so LeBron could push one of the greatest teams of all time in Golden State to 6 games with a starting 5 of Delly/Shump/Bron/TT/Mosgov because he was the best player in the league by far.   Also didn’t yet mention the 2016 playoffs when Love averaged 8 points on 35% shooting against the 73 win Warriors who were an awful matchup for him but the Cavs still came back down 3-1 with LeBron putting in arguably the greatest finals performance of all time because he was the best player in the league by far.  While we’re at it let’s fast forward to 2018 after Kyrie was PMSing and forced a trade in which the Cavs got back a pile of garbage and still went on to win the East and make the finals with Jeff Green being their 2nd best player in the playoffs ahead of “superstar” Kevin Love. That same team went on to win 19 fucking games the next season when Bron went to LAL.  Sounds like Bron was really cockriding them hard though lmao.   Meanwhile when MJ retired to play baseball the Bulls still won 55 games, pushed the Knicks 7 games in the 2nd round, and got screwed out an ECF appearance at least by the referees. Anchored by arguably the best coach of all time, MJ had a supporting cast that was still a contender without him. When Lebron left Cleveland for Miami, they won 19 fucking games after winning 61 with the same team the year before plus LeBron. But MJ is WARRIOR for being drafted to an organization that put him in an incredible situation  unlike the COWARD LeBron who only carried Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams to the finals once before leaving after wasting 7 years. Lmaoooo.  Kobe got drafted to play in LA with one of the 3 most dominant players in the modern era while also getting to play for one of the best coaches of all time. Kobe averaged 15 points on 35% shooting in the finals against Indiana and they still won easily because Shaq averaged literally close to 40 points on  almost 60% shooting lmao. THAT is cockriding like a playboy bunny. But once again, What an absolute GAMER  for not leaving the absolutely perfect situation that was brought to him unlike the FRAUD LeBron James who went running from Drew Gooden and Larry Hughes after 7 years. Also Kobe totally didn’t publicly request a trade after they had a couple bad years after Shaq left before they got Pau Gasol and reloaded. That definitely didn’t happen and Kobe would’ve stuck it out for way more than 7 years in Cleveland with Boobie Gibson and Jamario Moon because he was a true junkyard DOG unlike LEBUM.  The LeBron hating cult has gone way past the point of insufferable. Y’all have been bitching about a dude leaving the most incompetent franchise in sports (while Boston was in the conference coming off a finals appearance with 4 stars on one team, mind you) for literally over a decade now. Get over it."
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
"That’s interesting because when I googled “Kyrie anti semetic” these were the top 2 results:  https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/israel-causes-american-sports-stars-break-their-silence-here-s-n1267179  https://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/fl-jj-kyrie-irving-focused-israel-gaza-conflict-basketball-20210518-das54agnevfdro2lfh6hrwzwwe-story.html  And the only result that even accuses Kyrie of antisemitism is a post on RealGM forums about some vague galaxy brain Instagram post. So yeah, sorry I’m having trouble believing you’re commenting in good faith."
"Julius Erving, Kyrie Irving, George Irvine"
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
They were a game away from going to the finals without both Hayward and Irving... Who knows what would've happened the second year if Kyrie hadn't been a contentious asshole the whole season. Even that could've been fine if he didn't actively sabotage the team's defense and become prime Westbrick on offense for the playoffs.
"Hey man Ben Simmons is already like 5’9 and shredded! He’s good to go, and he could definitely beat up Kyrie Irving in a fight"
"Dude you don't know how to find anything do you.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kwq2ik/charania_the_nets_are_trading_for_allnba_star/gj5mqap/  &gt; wtf are they going to change the rules to allow more than 1 ball on the court?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/kwqrev/whats_youre_initial_thinking_on_the_harden_trade/  &gt; I'm more skeptical about Durant-Irving-Harden Nets than most, I think. How much value does Harden bring playing off-ball? Creating your own shot is very valuable but aren't the Nets already in the diminishing returns territory?  &gt; Other than that, I agree with what others are saying - I don’t see how this works for Brooklyn. KD showed he can work off the ball at GS, but that was with (in my opinion), better passers than the Nets currently have. Both kyrie and harden need the ball to be effective. I don’t think that the nets will get as much value out of harden as they have “paid for”  &gt; Was never a huge fan of Harden to Brooklyn solely based on the fact that he feels very redundant with Kyrie and KD. The offensive heavily revolves around Kyrie and KD already having the ball in their hands, and so Harden isn’t really giving you much more than they are, just means you are having possessions where you are taking the ball out of their hands and giving it to harden instead, which changes very little imo.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kx0ax9/everyone_keeps_saying_harden_and_kyrie_can_play/   &gt; Also Steve Nash's offensive system looks like he's literally just telling these guys to go out and play pick up basketball. I don't see how he's going to blend an offense to make this work  &gt; Who tf is saying Harden can play off ball lmao  &gt; off ball just means standing around when it's not their turn to iso don't think too hard about it  Bonus   Ben Simmons  &gt; Obviously, Brooklyn has a lot of talent. But at the end of the day, there’s only one ball and you’ve got to play defense, too.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/04/13/ben-simmons-on-nets-theres-only-one-ball-and-youve-got-to-play-defense-too/   I cba to find more.  People expecting KD/Harden/Kyrie not to work out was an extremely common sentiment and you're delusional and revisionist to think otherwise lmao. Of course defense and personality were bigger questions, but the one ball argument was still common."
"Kyrie Irving, who thinks the Earth is flat, got into Duke...a school with a 7% acceptance rate and an average SAT score of 1560/1600."
No they don’t lmao. They were like the fourth best team in the league last year and would’ve lost in the second round if they didn’t get insanely lucky with that freak Kyrie Irving accident and James Harden’s hamstring imploding literally two minutes into the series.
Kyrie Irving
"He's a nice facilitator in a Marc Gasol type sense. Just a net positive in terms of ball movement which seems like a big gain considering Celtics fan often complained about their ball movement   He's had some very light success at maning Giannis in his previous stint with the Celtics. I doubt he can hold up anymore but he's another body that can somewhat compete with him physically.  Crazy how they've been hemorrhaging so many starter quality players (Horford, Kemba, Hayward, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier, Kyrie Irving) yet are still a solid team."
"Hey man I’m just answering the question you asked lmao. Just saying the Cs are willing to splash when they have a shot. They’re clearly not a Championship team rn so no point in going over luxury tax.  Anyways what else should they have done better there in your opinion? Have Hayward not snap his leg? Bubble wrap Kemba’s knees? Don’t even get me started on Kyrie “If you’ll have me” Irving. At the end of the day only one team can win a ring, 29 others are disappointed. The Cs have still won a ring more recently than 20/30 franchises so even though we couldn’t get it done in the last 5 years I’m not going to lose much sleep over it, that’s just life 🙂"
"what is this comment...?   1) Pippen, without Jordan, was 1 game away from making the ECF in 1994  2) Kevin Love and and Kyrie Irving literally never made the playoffs before LeBron found them yet everyone still considers those Cavs to be a superteam."
"1996 is the only year that you can even argue MJ had a superteam and even then I am def taking Chris Bosh, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, and Russ over Bulls Rodman"
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
Chris Bosh and Kyrie Irving are not superstars they are all-stars.  Westbrook is not an all-star anymore.
If LeBron-Davis wasn't a superteam (it wasn't) neither is LeBron-Davis-Westbrook. Russ isn't as good as Kyrie Irving is.
Kyrie Irving actually thinks the earth is flat.
"Harder working, probably not in most cases. Coachable? Well, compare someone like a Giannis or a Jokic to Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving."

"After the Australian Kyrie Irving called out Dennis for not being a true African American because Dennis was born in Germany, his confidence decreased and he bricked more shots and made bad passes."
"Let’s see, play with buddies Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade in beautiful Miami for one of the best organizations in the league, or go back to the Cavs, who have Kyrie Irving and the #1 pick, but are owned by Dan “comic sans” Gilbert and are generally a dumpster fire.  The Heat were the easy choice. Apparently it’s hard for you to believe, but Cleveland was a harder road."
Kyrie Irving is American. Both his parents are American he grew up in America. He was just born in Australia.
Nah he returned to Cleveland because they had Kyrie Irving and just got the first pick to offload for Kevin Love who are joking with this he did it for Cleveland take. If they weren't setup they way they were he never goes there. Also I meant the '14-'15 season and the '14 offseason which the Lakers did try to go after him.
"Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Ja Morant aren't superstars."
Kyrie last season: 26.9/4.8/6 on 50/40/92  Russ last season: 22/11.5/11.7 on 43/31/65  Russ is 32. Irving is 28.
"lol don't get so amped up. I've never heard of any guy named Nunn or Melon thats for sure. And I doubt any of those aforementioned guys will be surefire pieces to LeBrons Avengers team, he will want to add a couple more shooters since he AD, and Westbrook are moreso midrange guys who can hit occasional 3s.    The Nets were up 2-0 on the Bucks without James Harden, before losing Kyrie Irving. And we all know it was an exciting 7 game series that came down to an inch, as in if KDs shoe would have been a fraction of an inch off the 3pt line the Bucks aren't champions.   Kyrie, Harden, KD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Westbrook, Bron, AD."

"Caruso got left than the MLE. The Lakers wouldn’t even match the offer let alone give him more than that. Lol that’s disloyalty at its best.   You dumped Kuzma for Russell Westbrook. Kuzma would’ve gotten that contract on any other team that drafted him, it wasn’t a “fat” contract. You keep calling these mediocre contracts “fat”. You do NEED Westbrook. You just lost the first round and panicked. That’s why your roster is completely overhauled right now. Your team from this year and last year are completely different than the championship team.   Thanks for the long winded way of telling me what I already said. The Lakers dumped all their young players for Anthony Davis. BI and Lonzo only got paid as much as they did because of the strides they made with NOLA. Their reputations weren’t high when they left LA.   “You find me another team who wouldn’t make that trade” Find me another team that doesn’t trade IT for Kyrie Irving. You see? You’re proving my point for me.   IT didn’t get paid before or after his injury because he wasn’t good enough to get paid that much. Either way he wasn’t getting paid.   Why didn’t the Lakers re-sign him after they traded for him the season after? Because he wasn’t the same player.   You just asked me sarcastically if the Lakers were supposed to over pay Alex Caruso because you had his bird rights, but now you’re implying the Celtics should’ve given an undersized injured point guard a max contract instead of trading for Kyrie? Lol   AD’s father wasn’t right. If anything he exposed he’s a hypocrite. The Lakers dumped all their players for his son because he colluded with LeBron and his agency the year before and quit on his team. But yeah the Celtics are disloyal. It has nothing to do with just wanting to play with LeBron and be in LA. Definitely. Haha"
you guys have Kyrie and Irving?
"Well you could never double him with Durant,Kyrie and Irving standing out  on the 3PT line,and considering that you have to switch everything vs the Nets,chances are he would get some good looks each game.He was All-NBA 2nd team in 2015 and 3rd team 2016 for a reason.  Also the Nets have good targets on offense in Melo and WB and there is nowhere to hide.Obviously the Lakers are monstrous inside on both ends of the floor,but both WB and Carmelo are awful on offense with no ball in their hands,and LeBron was a worse shooter at the time than he is now."
Can WOKE kyrie Irving stay healthy or Santa clause james harden? Probably not so this point sounds pretty dumb.
"LA Lakers now have THREE superstar players (LeBron, AD, Russ). Over half the league doesn't even have 1 superstar player on their respective rosters!  &amp;#x200B;  Then let's look at Brooklyn. Kevin Durant, James Harden &amp; Kyrie Irving. Another team with three friggin superstar players."
"Do you enjoy watching all the NBA superstars play together on a handful of desirable NBA markets? LeBron, AD &amp; Westbrook...superstar players...all on the same team...Kevin Durant, James Harden &amp; Kyrie Irving...superstar players...all on the same team. You have well over half the league without even one superstar player on their roster! xD"
"the Warriors became the overwhelming favorites to win the title in 2017 and 2018 after adding KD. Klay was our 3rd option. This Nets team, with looking at the current landscape of the league, are very obviously the overwhelming favorites to win the title, I can't even think of a better 3rd option in NBA history than Kyrie Irving, this dude averaged 27 in the 2016 finals and hit arguably the greatest shot in history - not to mention KD proving he was one of, if not the best player in the NBA in the playoffs as he almost single-handedly beat the Bucks - was literally one shoe size away from the title."

Kyrie “Brand Risk” Irving at it again
"Who gives a shit? The fact remains that the full strength Nets would’ve smashed the Bucks and it wouldn’t have been close. Durant and either of a healthy Harden or Irving would’ve demolished them.   And Kyrie Irving’s injury was just an accident, not an extension of his previous injury problems. It could’ve happened to anyone."
"It's pretty wild that the members of the 50/40/90 club in the last decade are Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Malcolm Brogdon, and Kyrie Irving."
"Entering the 2017-18 season we had:  Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes.  We also controlled the rights to Sacramento's draft pick in 2019 and had the Grizzlies first-round pick protected 1-7 until 2021.   It was such a ridiculous position to be in that Zach Lowe at that time called it maybe the greatest rebuild in the history of the NBA coming off the KG-Pierce trade where we blew it up.   Now, only 3 of those players remain, and both of those draft picks that were thought to be treasured assets turned into late-lottery picks. It's unbelievable.   Curse of IT is/was real. Let's hope it's ended now that Danny is gone."

"I tend to agree that it’s better not to spend big on traditional center because you can get good production for 1/4 the cost from other guys. It’s like paying huge money to a running back.   I like this signing though because of his age and because the cap will keep going up.   Also - not sure why there is a narrative about the Cavs not developing players.   Sexton, Garland, Okoro all developing nicely. Sexton is far exceeding expectations for a #8 pick.  The last rebuild featured a guy named Kyrie Irving. Tristan did great as well. Dion Waiters didn’t work out.   You may have also heard of a guy named Lebron James. You could argue that he was great anyway, and he was. But if that's your logic, which team ""develops"" players? The Spurs? Were Duncan and Ginobili and Parker not going to be great players anyway just like Lebron and Kyrie? Did the Raptors “develop” Siakam any more or less than the Lakers developed Kobe Bryant? Who gets to decide?"
How are you going to act like we don’t develop players well when the only high-drafted player we have had more than three years in the last decade is Kyrie Irving?
"This is a bunch of bullshit.  When bron left for Miami, cavs had 3 #1 picks in 4 years. This kind of luck is historical in literally all of sports.  So it’s not like they have up future assets for him. They just wasted them on bums like Anthony  Bennett. And while Kyrie was a great player him alone is not enough to get you to the playoffs so they did absolutely nothing to try.  In fact, the year Lebron left cavs had 2  picks in the top 5. They drafted Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson.  I’m the end, bron had to return to save them.  Don’t give me all that BS about bron making you lose your future to win rings now. They had plenty of chances to make a good team after bron left the first time."
"No lol  New Orleans Pelicans starting PG Jrue Holiday was limited to 55 minutes total and missed one game of the Warriors' sweep entirely coming off a stress reaction in his right tibia. Memphis Grizzlies starting PG Mike Conley missed Game 1 of the series with Golden State because of a facial fracture, and starting SF Tony Allen played just five minutes over the last two games because of a sore left hamstring. The Houston Rockets played without starting PG Patrick Beverley and backup F/C Donatas Motiejunas, while starting C Dwight Howard played through a torn MCL and torn meniscus suffered during the Western Conference finals. In the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without starting PF Kevin Love because of shoulder surgery early in the playoffs and lost starting PG Kyrie Irving to a fractured patella late in Game 1."
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
"Not sarcasm. I'm not saying it's likely, but it's attainable.   * Cleveland did it with LeBron and then Zydrunas and Mo Williams (acquired not drafted).  * Orlando did it with Dwight and then Jameer and Hedo.  * Golden State did it with Steph (not #1 pick), Klay and Draymond.  * OKC did it with Durant, Westbrook and Harden.  * Utah did it with Boozer, AK and Deron Williams  Point is, it's possible for team's to follow the Spurs formula of building through the draft and trades. Not everyone is going to hit homeruns like the Spurs did, but it's at least possible. No matter how hard the Jazz try, they aren't going to have LeBron, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, or Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden all of a sudden decide they really want to live in Salt Lake City and force their way their.   That was my only point with that first paragraph. Not that everyone is going to draft Tim Duncan or win 5 titles across 20 years, but that unlike how Miami won it's '12 and '13 titles, it is at least a possibility for most franchises."
"This is classic hindsight. That Cavs team was definitely a super team, no doubt. Kevin love had a 30/30 game the season (or maybe 2 seasons) before joining the Cavs. He was a top 3 rebounder in the league and could stretch the floor, averaging over 20 points in the process. As people have said, Love was regarded as a top 20 player back then. People probably had him above Kyrie Irving!  Lebron could’ve averaged one point and it still would’ve been a super team. Hindsight ain’t changing that the Cavs team was a super team."

I think Kyrie has alot of pseudo-intellect moments, but he absolutely does great things for the improvished. That is something he puts alot of effort into and is very much one of his top priorities in life.  I do believe the Capitol Hill riots were a major play in his absence and his Sister's birthday was on January 12th.   For reference he left the team on January 8th, the day after the riots.   At that point, his abscence from the facilities required him to enter COVID protocol regardless if he went to Asia's birthday party or not."
Kevin Durant + Kyrie Irving + James Harden will mop the floor with any team while fully healthy. Nothing the Lakers could have done unless Kawhi teamed up instead of Westbrook. It's just unlucky
"How in god's green earth a comment like that is upvoted is beyond me. Kyrie last year averaged 27/5/6 on 50/40/92, but yeah ""fuck that"". You can't name 10 players in this league better than Kyrie Irving offensively, just because he isn't a #1 option that doesn't diminish him.  Also what the fuck is a ""contending level #1 option""? The Blazers have never been close to being ""real contenders"" with Dame, does that make him incapable of being a #1 option? Does that diminish Dame's value as a basketball player? Seriously, wtf."

If we’re considering Kyrie a PG and James an SG now I hold heartedly believe Kyrie is probably the best SG in the league (yes over Bradley Beal)  He had an absolutely amazing season this year, 9 in points per game, 11th in PER, and is the 9th player to make the 50/40/90 club, he also was having a good playoff run before he went down, and yes I do think Nets take the chip if Kyrie is healthy.  The Nets are a top heavy team that prides themselves on having 3 players who can go off at any moment and are borderline unstoppable when they do, I’ve seen you say it’s best they trade Kyrie, and no offense, that’s BS too.  There aren’t 15 players in the nba better than Kyrie"

Kyrie Irving has never played in a 2nd round playoff game without LeBron James.    They played 3 seasons together.
"who would you rather have, this Klay Thomson or current day Kyrie Irving?"
Lol what? I love Iggy and KD both. Everything you say is spoken directly from your ass. KD is the best player in the league rn. Shame that he feels the need to gather so many players so shit isn't even competitive. Apparently Kyrie Irving isn't enough help. It was for Lebron oddly enough.

If you have any links supporting the notion that the guys you mentioned have been publicly critical of Kyrie (not merely rumors or hearsay) then I will gladly admit I’m wrong.
"You have it backwards. He takes more shot attempts *because* he’s a better scorer. He’s not a better scorer *because* he takes more shot attempts.   &gt;So since Sexton averages 10 ppg than Simmons and Draymond, he is better than both of them now. That’s what u are making it sound like.   It’s not. You don’t understand how to compare aspects of basketball on a spectrum. According to you, this is how we should rank players.  Sexton - only good at scoring = 1 point   Lonzo - good at passing and defence = 2 points  Draymond - good at passing and defence = 2 points  Simmons - good at passing and defence = 2 points   Therefore all these players are better than Sexton. You aren’t understanding that the *degree* of how good they are is important. It’s not a binary on/off switch. Simmons and Draymond being DPOY level defenders isn’t the same thing as Lonzo being an above average defender. The level of “good” they are defensively holds a lot more weight than Lonzo’s level of “good” defence.   &gt;Lonzo overall is a better player than Sexton. When Sexton’s scoring is not available, what does he provide. When Lonzo’s 3 pt shot is off, he still gives u that playmaking and defense.  Let me ask you this. Are Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, and Kyle Lowry better than Kyrie Irving? They’re better at more things than him. When Kyrie’s shot isn’t available, what does he provide?"
They don’t need him but having Kyrie Irving be the third best player on your team definitely puts you over the top. Why wouldn’t you want to create the best roster to win a championship?
"I want to include a quote from the stroy, to provide some context. David Aldridge is a great writer and generally speaking, voices support for players and progressive causes. So he's not simply doing an easy to write hit piece here.    ""It is not pleasant because Beal is a centered, thoughtful dude in a league full of look-at-me egomaniacs. It is not pleasant because Beal — against all advice from many of his fellow NBA stars, and certainly all of you terry0873s out there — has been ridiculously loyal to the team that drafted him, loyalty being in short supply just about everywhere these days, and not demanded a trade out of Washington. It is not pleasant because Beal is a smart and caring member of the community, who has been a benefactor for multiple classes of kids at the Ron Brown College Prep High School in Northeast, among myriad other local charitable endeavors. It is not pleasant because Beal and Natasha Cloud led their Wizards and Mystics teammates in marching for social justice in downtown D.C. in June 2020.  It is not pleasant because I don’t like calling out brothers that, otherwise, do the right thing almost all of the time, and are role models in the truest sense.  But he is wrong, the way Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins are wrong, the way that the portion of the country that still, for varied reasons, refuses to get vaccinated, is wrong."""
I could see him doing what Bruce brown did for us last year. But that’s a very low bar for KYRIE IRVING. I agree he should take the vax but if everyone else is vaccinated they’re gonna be fine. He’s only a risk to himself. Let the man do his job
"It’s still sounds so ridiculous that he has Celtics record for 3s in a game when we had guys like Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Isaiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving, and the Jays lol"
"You also shouldn't take the ball out of Harden or KD's hands and give it to Irving either though. While those are still positive possessions, they are worse possessions than if KD or Harden used them. Kyrie needs/wants the ball in his hand more than the ideal third fiddle for a group with KD &amp; Harden, while bringing nothing to the table defensively.  He's also unlikely to perform at a high level in the playoffs. He hasn't had a good, healthy playoffs since 2017.  He was outright bad in 2019 and mediocre at best in round 2 this year before the injury.   Kyrie's skillset is redundant on the Nets, and his injury history means there's a chance he's dead weight in the playoffs. I don't think there's a team in the league he helps less than the Nets. So from purely a basketball fit perspective, what he could bring back in a trade (if his trade value isn't damaged by his eccentricities) would be more helpful."
"I live in New York and the most unvaccinated group are blacks at 73% unvaccinated.  If you think ridiculing all of them will change their mind, then go ahead and do so.  There was a blm protest regarding the carmines incident as well.  I love how Reddit thinks it’s mostly white trump supporters refusing the vaccine.  I never knew kyrie Irving was a big trump supporter but he surely is anti vax."
"&gt;But he is wrong, the way Kyrie Irving and Andrew Wiggins are wrong, the way that the portion of the country that still, for varied reasons, refuses to get vaccinated, is wrong.  Beal is worse than Wiggins and Irving because he was actively (and pompously) spouting misinformation about the vaccine at his press conference.  ""It's my choice"" is dumb, but ""the vaccine doesn't actually protect you"" is worse."

"Kyrie Irving. I personally don’t hold his exit against him but a lot of Cavs fans do, his tenure on the Celtics was rocky, and he’s been a source of controversy on the nets."
Shocking that Bill Simmons has a negative opinion of Kyrie Irving.
I’m sorry but this is horseshit. Kyrie just had a 50/40/90 season scoring 27PPG. He’s a perennial all star. A Simmons for Irving swap would be a net negative (no pun intended) for the Nets.  People are just running with the idea that he wouldn’t report to a new team and straight up retire. This has always just been a creation of the media and there’s absolutely nothing to verify it. For now it’s all hearsay.  And for the record I would want him to be traded if he’s really willing to sit out games. It’s clearly detrimental to the team.
"Kyrie loves finding reasons not to play, though.  Like he sometimes just decides not to play.  Remember this?  https://slate.com/culture/2021/01/kyrie-irving-nets-zoom-call-party-video-is-weird-stuff.html  This isn't the dude I would 100% rely on to play."

"&gt; Anyways wasn't there a report saying that Kyrie was gonna take the vaccine after convincing from KD?  Pretty sure that report was more saying ""They believe KD will eventually be able to convince Kyrie to get the vaccine,"" not that anyone  has any evidence/sources saying that it's actually happening.  Just like the reports on Wiggins saying people believe he'll back down after getting denied on the religious exemption attempt.    Basically just people assuming that common sense and desire to not lose money (or hurt the team's play, or hurt locker room chemistry) will win out. But relying on common sense to prevail against Kyrie Irving doesn't seem like the safest bet."
"Do I really need to narrate the history of post-championship Kyrie Irving to you?  In the shadow of LeBron on the Cavs even after his own Finals-winning shot, Kyrie wanted to do it on his own and asked out. Got moved to the Celtics, and since it was an unpredictable trade request, GM David Griffin could only get an injured Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, and a 1st Rd pick.  Then, after struggling to grab a hold of the leadership role in already quickly-developing young Celtics team, leaves for Brooklyn in FA after literally telling a full TD Garden that he would re-sign.  He's missed about 1/4 of his games in the NBA and stands to miss even more this year. What's more unpredictable than that?"
I really hope you misread who he’s talking about and meant Kyrie Irving.
"Full quote:  I stand with Kyrie Irving.   I stand with Andrew Wiggins.  I stand with Bradley Beal.  I stand with Jonathan Isaac.  #NBA  #YourBodyYourChoice  2/x I’ve never said this before: I agree with @KingJames   “We’re talking about people’s bodies and well-being. I don’t think I personally should get involved in what other people should do for their bodies and livelihoods.”  3/x @KingJames is being courageous here.  With his box-office power, he could be even more courageous—he could SOLVE the problem—by saying:  “I stand w/ my fellow players. And I won’t play in any arena that bans another NBA player because they make a personal healthcare choice."""
"Kyrie Irving actually never wanted to get the vaccine. He just said, ‘If people would just stop asking me to get jabbed, that’d be something I would love to experience. If not, I’m ok not playing.’ I said, ‘What about giving up half your paycheck?’ He said, ‘Hell no.’"
"When he plays he’s a top 5 shooting guard, any argument that he has no trade value dies right there. If you’re a GM on a team that needs a starting guard and you pass on a good deal for Kyrie Irving because he’s “too unpredictable” you’re losing your job full stop, and rightfully so. He’s a clown but he’s still one of the most talented basketball players ever, stop being dumb."

Kyrie has [literally indicated that he would retire were he to be traded](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/09/16/report-kyrie-irvings-agents-saying-irving-would-retire-if-nets-trade-him/)  Idk why there would be anyone incapable of believing what Mannix is saying here.
"[That is, in fact, what Kyrie has indicated lol](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/09/16/report-kyrie-irvings-agents-saying-irving-would-retire-if-nets-trade-him/)"
I mean honestly deep down I disagree with this but at the same time I hate Kyrie Irving and that aspect is definitely winning out rn.
Yet this fucking fool is the Vice President of the [NBPA](https://nbpa.com/news/kyrie-irving-elected-to-nbpa-executive-committee-as-vice-president)
"&gt; “I’m a fan of Kyrie. I would just appeal to him – get vaccinated,” he said. “Your fans want to see you. We all want you back. Your teammates want you back. Look, there are teams now that are 100% vaccinated. That’s a great example to everybody else.” &gt;  &gt; But when asked if Irving was letting fans down, de Blasio declined to go there. &gt;  &gt; “It’s not time to say that yet. We have weeks and weeks before the season begins,” he said. “I think his fans are going to say to him, ‘C’mon, join us, help us, let’s keep everyone safe — keep your own family safe, keep your teammates safe, keep your community safe.”"
"&gt;In a session of the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Spain’s head of government, blasted Kyrie Irving over his reported dalliance with COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories.  &gt;“I have been a basketball fan for many years, and I follow the NBA basketball league a lot,” Sanchez, a member of Spain’s ruling Socialist Workers’ Party, told the parliament. “Nowadays, there is a problem in the NBA itself. There are several players who have spoken out against vaccinations. There is an NBA star who says he does not want to vaccinate because there is a conspiracy to vaccinate blacks and connect them with a computer that has a Satanic plan. This is verbatim.”  &gt;Although Sanchez did not name Irving, the reference was clear.   https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/9/29/22700225/spains-prime-minister-slams-kyrie-irving-over-vaccine-conspiracy-theories"
I don’t understand Spanish but I didn’t hear “Kyrie Irving” or “NBA”
"..... At least give a vague translation, are you expecting most of us to understand Spanish? I honestly didn't even catch ""Kyrie Irving"" in this."
"Kyrie ""Global Icon"" Irving"
Andrew Wiggins will forfeit $15.8 million this season if he refuses to get vaccinated.  Kyrie Irving will forfeit $17.5 million if he chooses not to get vaccinated.
"Well if the choice is either get it or die essentially I don’t really see how that’s choosing lol , most people aren’t kyrie Irving and need to work in order to live. It’s not a choice in that scenario"
Shams: “Kyrie Irving has requested the Nets play all home games in Tampa for the 2022 season”
"At this point, Im prepared to see the headline: ""Kyrie Irving has retired from basketball."" I think he's crazy enough to do it over these new mandates"
"So, you agree that unvaccinated players should be suspended (stay at home) as to not harm others… cool!  You don’t seem to understand that you’re agreeing with me. Otherwise your point makes no god damn sense because unvaccinated players would be doing all the things I listed (and possibly more extra curricular activities as well).   Should Damien Lillard have to worry about bringing home a deadly virus to his newborn child because Kyrie Irving doesn’t believe in science? That’s fucked dude… that’s the whole reason for vaccinating and having safety protocols.   Honestly, if the players association wants to be dumb I genuinely hope that every arena enacts their own vaccination/masking standards and keep players out of the building if they have to. The science is good, the sample size at this point is massive."
haaha i was gonna reference kyrie irving. i think it's ridiculous that these unbelievbly talented people have to sit here and get crticized basically by these idiot journalists. not even the preisdent of the united states has to sit in front of journalists... what the hell ya know?
&gt;Kyrie Irving Says Ben Simmons 'Filled with Great Sadness'
"youre just getting into an infinite regress. the man can have a big ego and misguided beliefs, but that doesnt mean kyrie irving wont put the nba players first considering that is what his occupation is."
"The reporter is a moron..  That's literally what HIPPA law is  &gt;  Who knows what personal health problems Dwight is suffering from? He won't disclose it.  The fact that he wants to keep all that information private, is more mature than whatever someone like Kyrie Irving has been doing  &gt;  That reporter is an obnoxious idiot and this entire subreddit eats up all that garbage as well.. Without any context.  Whatever it takes to get some ""LOLs"" and memes"
"my dude, if you're the type of person to think that kyrie irving genuinely believes the earth is flat, that brings into question YOUR general decision making abilities."
kyrie irving and kevin durant... wait
Here is my top 20 list  1. KD 2. Giannis 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lemickey 5. Steph Curry 6. James Harden 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Luka Doncic 9. Dame Lillard 10. AD 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Jayson Tatum 13. Trae Young 14. D Booker 15. CP3 16. Paul George 17. Jimmy Butler 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. Joel Emfatass 20. Karl Anthony towns
"The PA has kyrie Irving in a leadership role, of course it is making dumbass decisions"
"He won in the most injured season ever, nobody cares. Harden didn’t even play, Irving and durant were enough to be beating your ass until Giannis had to step on kyrie. Stop trying to super coat shit"
"I think he's more ""conspiracy theory"" a la Kyrie Irving than Young Socialite."
I think Kyrie Irving easily takes the title of dumbest asshole in the league.
"I didn't hear that Fournier had someone test positive close to him when he entered protocols after coming back from his false positive. We didn't have anyone else out at the time, so I don't see how that could be the case. He just sorta went into protocols.   Kyrie also got fined and suspended for being seen at a party and breaking quarantine: https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-nets-star-kyrie-irving-fined-50000-violating-nbas-covid-protocols  Last year was before vaccinations were widely available -- the NBA is clearly making the rules so that unvaccinated players are very much enticed to vaccinate."
"Well at least he is vaccinated. Not the same tier of stupid as Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons."
Called kyrie irving goated
The fact that flat earther Kyrie Irving doesnt want to get vaxxed gives me even more confidence that getting vaxxed was the right thing to do.  This dude has a potato brain when it comes to anything other than basketball.
"How does Kyrie Irving look this man in the eye knowing how much he lost to Covid and knowing  Kyrie is just another asshat spreading misinformation about the virus, especially to the African American community which already faces strong vaccine hesitancy."
Can we please just get a mega thread for covid vaccine things.  Literally every post is about who is or isn't vaccinated.  I don't need to read 15 separate posts about dumb ass Kyrie Irving being a dumb ass.  Don't give these idiots a place to make their opinions heard.  Kick em out of the league and move on.
Kyrie has threatened surgery when he didn't get his way he is one of the first cases of a player not on an expiring contract to force a move. The Nets I'm sure would like to trade him for the right return BUT I think Irving would be the type of guy to refuse to play or accept the trade. We had concern over him never coming back to the NBA at one point last season with his disappearance.
It's a very relevant topic right now when it might stop Andrew Wiggins or Kyrie Irving from playing in a lot of games?  You seem very triggered.
I hate how stupid Kyrie Irving is. I can't wait for his stupid decisions to bite him in the ass
There’s really not a point to trade Kyrie unless he   Completely refuses to get the shot and knowing Kyrie the man is probably vaxxed despite all the stuff he says. And at the end of the day trading Kyrie Irving for a bunch of role players is dumb as hell he’s a top 30 player on this league.
He adopts the air of a laureate as he talks flat-Earth theory. He (kyrie irving)once said he has never seen a “real” picture of the globe and spoke of doing his “own research” into the actual shape of the planet.   is this real
"It's clear as day that he's not vaccinated, he has a history of saying incredibly idiotic (let's not forget the earth is flat nonsense) things, he has a long history of believing in conspiracy theories, and his likes on IG is pretty sus.   Also if this [tweet](https://twitter.com/ballsacksports/status/1442541331268743168?s=21) is true then I wouldn't be surprised if he is truly an anti-vaxxer. So the quotes of his aunts seem to be a sentiment he shares.   I'm a big fan of Kyrie on the court and to me he's one of the most entertaining players I've ever watched, I'm not looking for reasons to dislike him. I'll also say I doubt you defend Irving as much as you do if he wasn't Brooklyn Net. So I'm pretty sure you're the more biased party here."
"Calling someone a narcissist is not anti-science nor is it a medical diagnosis, it literally is a term that means someone who is up their own ass, like Kyrie Irving. Narcissistic personality disorder is a medical diagnosis which no one in the above comments has mentioned as far as I can see."
"Kyrie ""Uncle ""Smartest and most woke guy in the room"" Drew"" Irving"
"the only players that were not at media day, from my count was Kyrie Irving and Kessler Edwards \[2 way contract\].  You can assume those Two are the only ones not vaccinated or out for ""personal reasons""."
For sure the team without Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving. I also heard that Bron is anti vaxxer that he just took the vaxx to protect his image.
"No it isn’t. You want it to be, so you don’t have to deal with what is being said. Kyrie Irving is a fucking force of disruption and no it has nothing to do with him being black.   The other part of your comment is a straw man. No one is saying there is no racist people. Just that everything isn’t racist. If you can comprehend the difference don’t enter the discussion."
"I’m aware of the players association, but Kyrie Irving is the Vice President of that association. You can’t take him seriously, regarding the public health of all involved"
but nooo... instead we get Paul as president and fucking KYRIE IRVING as vice-president
"The only negative thing?  Lmaooooooooo  He’s a clown, an idiot as bad as Kyrie Irving, except much worse, because at least Kyrie helps his team on the court. Dennis Schroder was a minus player all year long and made a championship offense irrelevant with poor decision making and selfish play."
How in the world Kyrie Irving still has fans completely baffles me.
"Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, Michael Porter Jr,  Jonathan Isaac with Josh Richardson as the 6th man."
TIL Kyrie Irving is an NBAPA VP… awkward
Is D'Angelo Russell Kyrie Irving?😳
Is your ex Kyrie Irving?
I think you’re really not thinking in reality if you think Kyrie Irving is the source of people’s hesitancy against the vaccine. Not defending him or DLo but your comment is a bit much. Out of all the unvaxxed players Kyrie has said the least in regards to it.
If we can get a Ben Simmons/Andrew Wiggins/Kyrie Irving 3 way trade then I will admit that GODGEVLAMSTE on YouTube is indeed RIGHT and we do in fact live in a crater!
"Are you seriously commenting this on every single vaccine related post you can find on the subreddit?  Vaccination status is important and good info to post on r/nba because it does have effects on the game. Kyrie Irving could miss games for this, same for Andrew Wiggins. In this case with this post there’s drama going on in the Warriors organization over Wiggins so naturally that’s going to be reported and posted.   The more players are vaccinated, the less time is missed for health and safety protocols. It’s that simple."
"Here's the thing, I don't fucking believe that. I don't believe Kyrie Irving, the same Kyrie Irving that believes vaccines are ""the tool of the Elite to control and force coloured people to execute the Will of Satan"", is providing masks for COVID.  I think the only difference between Kyrie Irving and the fucking loonybins on Facebook shit posting about the illuminati is that he can play basketball really well so a bunch of people around him try to make him look good.  EDIT: He didn't even donate the fucking masks. Literally in the article you posted, masks came from a different entity."
I mean Kyrie has also done a lot for the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota.   People are not perfect and are often hypocritical. He's done some very good and some very bad  He in fact donated [3000 N95 masks and 2 truckloads of food to the reservation at the beginning of covid](https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/6485279-NBA-star-Kyrie-Irving-donates-food-masks-to-Standing-Rock-Sioux-tribe).
Kyrie 'Dingleberry' Irving

Wiggins may be dumber than Kyrie Irving...
"I feel bad for people like teachers.  Most people just don't realize the influence a star NBA player like Kyrie Irving has with his words and actions.  Literally fuck respecting other people's ""personal decisions"". There's a right view and there's a wrong view when it comes to this subject."
He’s going to the Kyrie Irving School for Special Kids Who Read Good
"I honestly do think both teams would be better with Irving and Simmons swapped. The Nets would love the defensive upgrade and a guy who is a willing ball-mover, and they certainly don't need more shooting.  For the Sixers, Kyrie would provide so much as a scorer and playmaker. It would really allow Embiid to really focus in on his game instead of trying to do everything, like he's been forced to recently.  It'll never happen though."
"95% is encouraging, people can't gloss over that. There's a Kyrie Irving in every profession, although of course more concentrated in the ones you don't have to go to school for."
You know there's gona be some graphic that comes on screen in the playoffs that'll be like:  NETS STARS TONIGHT  Kevin Durant - 43 points  Kyrie Irving - 35 points  Ben Simmons - 4 points
"Every time I read something by Kareem I think: ""you know what, that basketball players are stupid stereotype is completely wrong"". Then I get reminded of Kyrie Irving..."
Bucks legend Kyrie Irving will retire before getting the shot 🙏🏾
"Kyrie ""Part Time"" Irving"
I forget which pundit said it during the bubble but it was something along the lines of “Kyrie Irving could retire from the NBA very soon” or something to that effect. Wonder if he just doesn’t care about the game anymore.
"He's played with dwade and Chris bosh and Anthony Davis and kyrie irving,LeBron has had an elite level coach for all of his rings and jordans competition wasn't worse than LeBron"
I hope Paul tells Kyrie Irving this news.

KOBE and MJ is. Most certainly not KYRIE IRVING. FOH
"Kyrie Irving for Ben Simmons.  As a Sixers fan, I'd take it but fuck me Kyrie would not do well in Philly and would probably miss like 70% of games."
"The retraction you posted:  &gt;...**they would do a deal to swap Kyrie for Ben Simmons in a heartbeat**, but @KDTrey5 ain’t having it  Does not contradict the original headline:  &gt;Stephen A Smith says the **Brooklyn Nets were interested in trading Kyrie Irving for Ben Simmons** until Kevin Durant said no  Neither statement implies they contacted the Sixers front office."
"Kyrie Irving isn't mercurial, he isn't deep, he isn't complicated or misunderstood.  He's a pouty, pompous contrarian who can't stand being told he's wrong about things.   I am tired of people trying to make him out as some deep thinker. He's not, he's immature and his stans bend over backwards to add made up context for every stupid thing he says"
But in the eyes of kyrie them not moving where they practice for him could be a sign of disloyalty and betrayal because Kyrie Irving is that batshit insane to think along those lines
[Broussard] The Nets have signed Uncle Drew to a 1yr deal at the league minimum. My sources tell me he looks strikingly similar to Kyrie Irving.
"If Philly thinks Ben Simmons is a headache, buckle up for Kyrie Irving!"
"He believes in nonsensical and objectively incorrect things that he uses his platform to push onto others, which can become extremely detrimental. Saying he “believes in weird things” completely undersells this.   There are [literally kids in Ohio who started adopting flat Earth beliefs because of Kyrie](https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/07/28/kyrie-irving-flat-earth-theory-students).   If that isn’t yeeting bullshit into the world, then I don’t know what is."
"It is definitely crazy that a player that primarily plays around the perimeter doesn’t get as many free throws as players who drive to the basket a lot.   Like do people in this sub just see raw numbers and not think about context in any way?  Kyrie Irving has about the same FTA per game, I guess kyrie doesn’t get calls either, considering he drives to the basket way more than curry. Lillard has more but he drives to the basket more than curry."
naw our chief medical officer Kyrie Irving
I dont care any more than I care about the average person who isn't vaccinated. Like I get it on a symbolic level that it looks bad that these athletes aren't vaccinated but they're so far separated from the average person that it doesn't really affect you and I anyway. The unvaccinated people in your direct social circle or daily interaction are way more important than if Andrew Wiggins or Kyrie Irving ever gets the shot.
"Ahh the old “I’m done replying because I’m taking out my ass technique  How is your take away from what I said “the other unvaccinated players are end of the bench guys”? Since I didn’t make it obvious enough in my initial statement, **Kyrie Irving is by far the most high profile NBA player to not be vaccinated**. At no point in my statement did I definitively say every other unvaccinated player is an end of the bench guy.   You said there were 25 players by your estimates. How did you come up with that number? If you could provide any proof of research from a reputable source that’d be great. It seems like you’re anti-vax though so I’m not holding my breath for any meaningful amount of research aside from “Trust me bro”"
"&gt; I've literally paid thousands of dollars to use reddit.  Do you need help? I'm genuinely concerned because the more I talk to you, the more you sound like Kyrie Irving."
"I agree with that, but the point is the virus will most likely not affect Kyrie Irving. When you said “disease that can kill him or leave permanent side effects” he could say the same thing about the vaccine, just the chances of either of those things happening are so slim."
"Not what I meant. Kyrie Irving is way more likely to be unaffected by the virus than affected. The stats are very easy to find. Not saying he shouldn’t get the vaccine, but if he doesn’t, he statistically should be fine."
You guys are crying more about it than anyone else is seriously get over yourselves it’s just basketball  Also you have to be an absolute moron to want to unwarrantedly trade a basketball player as skilled as Kyrie Irving whether he’s KD friend or not
"&gt;Irving would have been traded by now  No he wouldn't have. The Kyrie ""headache"" has completely tanked his trade value. Other front offices aren't sure that he wouldn't retire if he got traded. It's better to keep him and hope he can play home games eventually than to trade him for pennies on the dollar."
?  KD plays with James Harden and Kyrie Irving I don't know how that is less than the pairings you just mentioned.
Kyrie Irving is 9 months older than Buddy Hield
"&gt; 1-3 (one of those loses being in overtime) vs the eventual champions despite having over 50% of their payroll, including their second and third best player, either sitting or playing highly injured.  I'm not disputing that KD in the series was incredible and achieved something incredible. I'm picking at the sleight of hand of crediting him with achieving a 7 game series *on his own* when the majority of those wins were with Kyrie Irving. It's just that. I am still someone who on most days thinks that KD is the best player in the world.  &gt; Please show me an example of a player carrying a team to game 7 if you don't count KD  Luka Doncic, Clippers/Mavs 2021. I don't think Luka is better than KD, but this is the problem with weighting so much on a handful of games."
"There literally wasn't even a proper garbage time! Not only did Nets only pull their starters with only a minute and a half left, Giannis came off the court **before the Nets starters**. Kyrie Irving was scoring after Giannis had left the court for the last time. I just don't understand how you have this kind of confidence."
Kyrie irving 32pp on 50 40 90
"Not realistic. Everyone knows Presti only trade for picks. Who cares about Kyrie ""Satanic Conspiracy"" Irving when you can get a 2034 1st rounder?"

To do that, it takes a long, long time of learning about other human beings, history and incorporating all that into things that I love."
"It's not like I'm not cared for, but it's not like people naturally give a fuck about people outside of a few close family and friends that's just normal.   I took the vaccine because I have at risk family, I'm actually not fearful of Covid personally I did it for them but I'm not going to sit around and tell people what they should and shouldn't do. That's not my job.  Like I said we're all adults, as you stated if someone doesn't care about you then you shouldn't have them in your network... Same applies to those of Kyrie Irving... If you know he's out here not vaccinated then don't be mad if one day he passes it on to you. it's your fault for going near him.  I have anti vax friends, I haven't seen them in 2+ years. I don't place judgement on them but if they died tomorrow from Covid it's a end result of their own actions not because of me."
Kyrie Irving and Buddy Hield were both born in 1992. Hield is also older than AD and Beal   Also Brandon Clarke is older than Jaylen Brown
"I hope he's not doing his ""research"" at the Kyrie Irving Institute of Virology"
&gt;Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving  There's another level in there where Kyrie has been a lot quieter than Bradley Beal but he has had a much worse impact since he is so much bigger as a personality.
"He's not efficient so of course his half court scoring is going to be lack luster. Also notice that the really elite efficiency guys are the ones that don't tend to get efficiency from FTs except zion. Curry, Jokic Kawhi and irving all probably get fewer FTs than they should (well maybe not Kyrie he avoids contact like he doesn't avoid the plague)."
"So you saying James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving had no success so far in the NBA and need to prove themselves? You have really high standards."
Nah he’d die on the glass bridge by Kyrie Irving hugging him and jumping off.
"Exactly, even during the Cavs 2016 finals win, Kyrie Irving only played 53 games that season.  Prime Klay, I know as a coach/gm will give me at least 70 games with 20 PPG on 46/41/83 play all nba caliber defense and being a cool-headed low service all-star."
Kyrie Irving is the other
"This is tricky because from a pure basketball sense, hell no. Between the lines the Nets are much better with Kyrie fuckin Irving. But off the court is where there's any chance in hell this could make sense. If Kyrie misses half the season, sure yeah this could possibly work for both sides.  That being said, KD would never okay this. Also, it's pretty difficult to defend Ben's off court antics right now. You'd be trading one liability for another, and I doubt the Nets GM jumps on that."
"He's like a less talented kyrie Irving    ""I should have a team built around me and be a leader. No I won't put in the work or make the team mine why would you ask?"""

"One day I hope Americans would understand that freedom doesn’t mean doing whatever you want. There is long-held precedent that the interests of public health supersedes individuals autonomy. One’s decision to not vaccinate affects everyone around them. That might be directly (getting sick, having a friend/family member die) or indirectly (needing heart surgery but not having enough beds to operate on said patients or perhaps having enough susceptible hosts to allow it to mutate to something more deadly). Either way, it affects us all, and the anti-vax idiots need to be shunned from society, even if they’re profoundly gifted basketball players like Kyrie Irving."
"Right, cause basketball is only entertaining because of dunks.  Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Luka, all of those players are boring cause they don't dunk"

"I'm far from an NBA historian but I'd wager the '15-'16 Cavs simply because there isn't much depth relative to other championship teams imo.

"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer’s newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons’ availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly — and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season’s $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons’ absence: It’s ‘borderline kind of disrespectful’  The Sixers’ position that they’re not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They’re trying to win a championship, and believe they’re in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who’s in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren’t as blindsided by Simmons’ desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons’ trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons’ camp don’t believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they’re just determined to do it on their terms.

Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta.YONG KIM / Staff Photographer Destined for a messy divorce  Publicly, the Sixers talk about wanting Simmons to return and be part of a championship team in Philly. The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has “run its course.”  “They know that,” a source said. “They’ve been known that. It doesn’t matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He’s going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.” Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can’t blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can’t blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  “But that doesn’t negate that the relationship is done,” another source said. “This is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That’s what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it’s not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.”  » READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers’ starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers’ tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons’ skills was more lovely, it’s hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers’ lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly’s steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn’t honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  “This entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,” a source said. “It’s not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It’s not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. …. It’s never been smooth at all.”  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player’s former team got worse. That’s something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid’s squad, not Simmons’ team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team’s go-to player.  “What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. “I’m just [speaking] facts. But because he’s Australian, because he’s a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.”"

"Watching him in the playoffs, I came away thinking he was kind of inconsistent. If he could work on that and improving his scoring in general and/or work on his defense, then he could be top 15.   I have him at 20  11.Damien Lillard   12.Jayson Tatum  13.Donovan Mitchell   14.Kyrie Irving   15.Chris Paul   16.Jimmy Butler  17.Trae Young  18.Paul George   19.Zach Lavine   20.Devin Booker  21.Bradley Beal   And you could even make the case that Beal is better than him. I don’t think he’s better than anyone in the top 15 personally. Even if you think he’s better than Chris Paul, there are still the players from 16-19 that have a case to be over him."
Thank you for this post I try telling people on social media that nobody at their normal 9-5  is going to  care if they don’t show up to work because they can easily be fired and replaced. You can’t replace kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons or any All star/ superstar player that’s important to their team.
"I said some of the top stars and highest paid players. Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving are without question two huge stars in this league. Wiggins is one of the top 25 highest paid players. They all fit under the description of ""some of the biggest stars and highest paid players"".  If anyone is being disingenuous it's you who's saying ""Kyrie doesn't count cause he's weird"" or some shit like that haha. Thats the whole point of the discussion. These weird, super high paid, super popular stars are spreading potentially harmful knowledge to society."
"Kyrie Irving, Andrew Wiggins, and Bradley Beal are 3 of the top 25 highest paid players in the NBA and all 3 have been vocally anti vax"
"In all seriousness man do I wish I could get that check. The older I get the more I see why and can relate with people calling professional athletes entitled babies. I see their side often as well, and I think for football players/combat sport athletes you gotta take into account the amount of times they get punched in the head…but certain guys, like Kyrie Irving for example, are douchebags and folks can’t admit it bc they like watching him play.   Kyrie is a dick. You have guys in the league who’s family has passed. Yet you read some bullshit online and think you’re a professional in other fields because you are rich from basketball. Fuck you kyrie"
It’s really narrative pushing how Kyrie got pushed into this stuff. People don’t want to really slam Beal and Issac then Wiggins isn’t popular enough. Irving no commented for so long they made him the leader
"This is why the ""dumb jocks"" had a strange tinge to me. We have entire teams vaxxed, almost the entire league and everyone was acting like we had 30 teams of Kyrie Irving.  People will find literally any reason to feel superior."
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
&gt;  if Paul George played with LeBron for a decade  No one in NBA history has had better teammates than lebron and he's still only 4-6 in the finals  HALL-OF-FAME TEAMMATES  LeBron:  * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Russell Westbrook * Carmelo Anthony * Derrick Rose * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal  Jordan:  * Pippen * Rodman * Kukoc * Parish
Do they don't. They exist to extract the most value from the employer and protect all of it's members. Freaking Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving are not underrepresented.
"All time favorite player: Michael Jordan, I was a young kid growing up in Chicago in the 90s who got to see a few of those games in person , so that's fairly obvious combined with just loving his game and his mentality      Current favorite player: Kevin Durant, I relate to him from the standpoint that even though I'm not 7 ft tall I've always been really skinny (6'2, 164 pounds as of this morning) , so his appearance was always very striking to me, combined with just loving his game as well to be 7 ft tall with that skill set, he's probably the most effortless looking scorer I've ever seen the guy will have 28 to 33 points and it doesn't look like it and he's only taking like 15 shots throughout the game lol, and I understand that his personality is not for everybody, which is fine, and I'm not going to feel sorry for a multi-millionaire in the prime of his career because he may not feel like answering questions, but personality wise I can understand where he's coming from, the man just likes the hoop, and play video games, invest his money and allegedly bang pornstars  Jimmy Butler and Nikola Jokic are Runners up though lol        Least fav: for the longest time I'd say it was Chris Paul but right now it's Kyrie Irving , I'm just so fucking sick of this dude lol"
"22ppg after 30ppg insane MVP season with 67% TS is terrible, plus his last few games were even worse to add to the terrible turnover numbers  Also his bad defense, he was outscored by Irving and they were matchup hunting on him, they match up hunted him in the most famous shot of that series by Kyrie   He had an abysmal series, if he was some sort of Kemba Walker level all star sure those are good numbers but he was the unanimous MVP"
I'd love to see the current Nets team in some [Jason Kidd era throwback jerseys.](https://static.artfire.com/uploads/mfs/items/4f/01/large/4f011c5e90e12d5bd822df50604a0510f64fe47ff37149e706c69d029ada9b1a.jpg) IIRC Kyrie Irving even posted a photoshopped pic of himself in one on Instagram.
"I think you're giving Kyrie the benefit of the doubt here by assuming that his ignorance about vaccines is coming from a place of intelligence about the plight of Black people. We know Kyrie is just not that bright. This is the guy who in all seriousness thought the world that we inhabit was flat because of [random videos on the Instagram algorithm pipeline.] (https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/12/kyrie-irving-celtics-flat-earth-instagram)   I'm not denying the horrible history that Black Americans in particular have dealt with in the distribution of medicine. As a Black person in medicine, those points and many more are completely valid. However, this history hasn't stopped Black people from getting vaccinated from Covid. [Black Americans are slightly less vaccinated than White Americans, and are disproportionally the ones getting vaccinated right now.] (https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/) Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving is once again liking conspiracy theories on Instagram. [This time] (https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nba-anti-vaxxers-covid-1231988/) from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan."" He's simply not intelligent, and thats not a bad faith argument at all."
"I said the same thing and got downvoted to hell. Group think it's a helluva drug.  That said, I'm also vaccinated because personally, I would rather be able to fly unrestricted and I want to protect those around me. I wear a mask when it's appropriate to wear a mask for the same reason.  I would go a step further and advocate y'all do the same so we can get to a balanced, peaceful society, but we're not gonna get there by forcing others to do things our way.  Getting upset at LeBron (or Irving) for having his own opinion is the opposite of what we should be doing. If Kyrie wants to lose money because he can't follow the laws the city he's playing in has set, so be it. Actions have consequences, and those consequences well be a far greater teacher than forcing others to comply with your opinion.  Sincerely, a politician who was running for US Senate when this pandemic started. I was tweeting about this back in January 2020, long before most of you even knew the word coronavirus"
"Scotty Pipen and Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant vs  Dewayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and AD"
"Vaccine passports do transform society. It’s not the shot that’s extreme it’s the exclusion of people. And let me re-iterate, I trust the vaccines and their efficacy. I just don’t support mandating it. Everyone should get vaccinated, but no one should be forced. I think it allows a slippery slope of government overreach. That’s ‘my conspiracy’..  The government does not care about us. They will tell us what they want us to hear. They literally admitted lying to us to save masks and PPE for doctors and medical staff. Instead of being upfront with us like adults, they lied to us like children. They told us it would just be 2 weeks to slow the spread. They told us once you’re vaccinated you won’t have to worry. I’m sure they knew that was a lie, but they knew it would get a good turn out.. They told us that they don’t know how this pandemic started, but it couldn’t possibly be from the Wuhan lab that we fund (which is now a credible suspect, and is not a tin foil hat conspiracy..). They can tell us anything and then say “well this phenomenon is rapidly unfolding and we’re still learning”.    This is not just about these two rich guys Andrew Wiggins and Kyrie Irving. And it’s not just Trump supporters and anti-vaxxers that are against the mandate. I’m hard left. But I don’t co-sign every single thing the left wants. People need to be less tribal with politics. They shouldn’t be afraid to have an opinion because they’ll sound like a liberal or sound like a conservative and don’t want to be labeled as such.   Also, I think there’s a far better solution than vaccine mandates, and we should have been working on it from the beginning. We should be investing billions into research for creating an accurate instant method of testing. The vaccinated can still spread it(and yes I know it’s a far lower percentage) so this would eliminate that vector."
"Before I continue, I could not agree with you more. That was one of it not the single best take on the subject I think I’ve read/heard.  That all being said, if you posted this in one of the many Kyrie Irving posts you’d be  downvoted to hell. Great example of this subs biases."
"Kyrie Irving showed up late to the film session. Brad Stevens was angry. ""What does *Ben Simmons* mean to you, coach?"" Irving asked."

kyrie irving is a snotty lil bitch. just thinking about all the shit he has pulled over the years... ive never felt such strong animosity for a player that i felt compelled to actually post something. i hate kyrie irving. considering all the bs he pulls the nets couldnt even trade him to equal value to any team cuz they wouldnt want to deal with his shit.
"Of all the NBA players, I feel like Kyrie would definitely be one that would give up a payday due to principle. Like, if I ever saw the headline, “Kyrie Irving has announced that he will be taking a year long break to focus on himself and reconnect with his roots. He will be deleting all social media.”, I would not be particular surprised"
"And how those half time game is sponsored they can say ""this game prize is brought to you by the super woke kyrie 'no shot' Irving""."
"Sorry I haven’t gotten back to you for a couple days. I had a lot to say and didn’t have the time to get back to it. I started playing CoD Zombies again on my Xbox 360 and I’ve failed so many times to do the Origins Easter Egg. Anyways.  I’ll preface this by saying that I am not anti-vax. No, I do not think the vaccine is going to kill you and it has a tiny chance of effecting you in any way besides normal side effects that come with most vaccines.  However, I’m very much against the idea of mandating this vaccine and having people lose their jobs over it and I’ll explain why. If you disagree with me, that’s fine, I totally understand. We most likely just have very different perspectives and experiences.  People have compared not getting the vaccine as being similar to doing other dangerously reckless things like drinking and driving or not wearing a seatbelt. You made the analogy of not getting the vaccine and getting fired for it is similar to showing up to work drunk and getting canned because of that.  I think those are poor analogies for one simple reason. COVID-19 is not *nearly* as dangerous as any of those examples. Drinking and driving is far more dangerous and reckless and you’re actively putting others in danger.  I do not believe that you are putting other peoples lives in danger by not getting the vaccine. This is where we’ll most likely disagree, and that’s fine.  People like to throw around the 600,000 deaths number and while that’s a truly tragic number of people who have lost their lives, it isn’t totally honest and here’s why.  1.) Hospitals get grants for reporting covid cases, so the number is inflated by hospitals trying to get more funding. The list of covid symptoms is huge so it’d be very easy to diagnose covid-19 without tests.   2.) [94% of patients that had severe covid reactions had underlying conditions,](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2021/21_0123.htm) so I think it’s perfectly reasonable for healthy people to trust their immune system. People that don’t want to risk fighting off covid naturally are encouraged to get vaccinated, and I don’t have a single issue with that.  3.) I don’t see why it’s an issue that someone isn’t vaccinated, if everyone that is worried about covid is vaccinated. I know the vaccine doesn’t completely stop that spread and doesn’t prevent you from getting covid, but it makes your chances of getting hospitalized and having symptoms that much smaller. [125,000 people have gotten covid after being vaccinated and only 1,400 of those were fatal.](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/breakthrough-covid-cases-least-125-000-fully-vaccinated-americans-have-n1275500) Very few of those 125,000 number had severe reactions, most of them were just positive tests, just like in Jaylen Brown’s case.  So I genuinely don’t understand why we are *still* worried about covid after getting vaccinated, when the chances of them catching covid is severely low.  Here’s the thing, people say it’s irresponsible to not get the vaccine since there’s a higher chance you’ll be hospitalized with covid. But, there are *hundreds* of things you can do that are irresponsible, but perfectly legal to do that can take up hospital space. Here’s a short list of things that are irresponsible and undeniably lead to a higher risk of being hospitalized and taking away ICU beds for those in need that are allowed:  Smoking  Drinking  Poor diet choices  Neglecting your personal health  All of those things are more likely to put you in the hospital and take up valuable beds for people that actually need them, so why aren’t they illegal? Why isn’t it illegal to overeat and put yourself at a *significantly* higher risk of hospitalizing yourself?  I just don’t understand the rationale behind mandating a vaccine for a virus that severely effects a small number of people? Yes I know that there’s a chance that even a perfectly healthy person can have a severe reaction to covid, but it’s very unlikely.  **TL;DR**  I’m just confused why people who want to naturally fight off covid are viewed as horrible people who are putting others in harms way. There are lots of things that normal people are allowed to do that put themselves at a severe risk of harming themselves.  I just think mandating a vaccine for a virus that only significantly endangers a small percentage of people is a slippery slope. I believe that the gov’t shouldn’t be able to control what we put in our bodies.   Here’s another example. While I’m morally pro-life, I believe in a woman’s choice to keep or not keep their child. I don’t think the gov’t should be able to force women to carry that baby to term. I don’t see how this vaccine debacle is that different. I believe they are both pro choice.  **Important note**  I believe that the NBA has every right to deny Kyrie Irving his paychecks and even not allow him to play. While I **morally** disagree with their choice, I don’t think the gov’t should be able to make that decision for any company.   So this isn’t me saying that the NBA is legally in the wrong for not allowing Kyrie to play and earn money, it’s just *my personal opinion* that it’s wrong."
"I mean he still has Harden and some really good role players by his side if Kyrie does not return this year, but yeah he's probably annoyed with Kyrie   But we have to see how the season plays out, what if the Nets do win the championship with no Kyrie Irving though, that probably gets Kevin into those consensus top 10 conversations so that could be interesting"
What exactly is it that Kyrie is trying to accomplish? Does he think lawmakers are going to change their minds on vaccine mandates because kyrie irving can’t play basketball?
"[The Athletic] While an Irving trade for Ben Simmons with Philadelphia is seen by some as an easy solution to both teams’ problems, sources with knowledge of the 76ers’ view said there is no interest in Irving at the moment.  Source: https://theathletic.com/2885135/2021/10/12/amick-kyrie-irving-proves-again-hes-comfortable-being-uncomfortable/  &gt; One thing is for sure — at least for now. While an Irving trade for Ben Simmons with Philadelphia is seen by some as an easy solution to both teams’ problems, sources with knowledge of the 76ers’ view said there is no interest in Irving at the moment. From management on down, it seems there is an unsurprising level of skepticism about that pairing working out any better than the Joel Embiid-Simmons duo that is zombified at the moment.  &gt; And in the absence of Irving getting an extension from the Nets — which is obviously not happening now — the other tricky part here is that he can opt out of his deal after this season. That’s obviously a major factor for any interested team."

Kyrie Irving Shut the Fuck Up Challenge
Having Kyrie let them have 2 off the  elite offensive weapons on the floor at all times  Any 2 men combo you can fit around your line up that feature 2 out of the 3 Irving Harden Durant are already such a headache for opposing defense
I believe getting vaccinated is what is right.  Does that mean Kyrie Irving stands with me?
"1) I feel like everything you typed shows why Kyrie would fit on the Bulls. Lonzo doesn’t need the ball in his hands. Kyrie just showed how productive he can be with two player who must have the ball in their hands in Harden and Durant.   2) Why wouldn’t the Nuggets trade Murray, coming off an injury, for Kyrie Irving, the far superior player without Murray injury? You’re talking about chemistry and such, but the Nuggets did a damn good job without Murray. Add Kyrie to that team and they are dangerous.   3) You’re speaking like you are one of Shams’ sources. Give me a concrete course than Kyrie wouldn’t player for the Lakers.   4) once again, give me a source.   5) I apologize that I misspelled Ingels’ name. It is a sin that cannot be forgiven. Jazz would absolutely accept that trade. You’re a fucking idiot if you don’t think they wouldn’t take that in a heart beat. If there aren’t better offers for Kyrie, which clearly do not exist based on what you have commented, why would the nets accepts this trade? What benefit is it to the Nets to keep Kyrie and let him walk after the season knowing full and well he won’t play another game in a Nets uniform?"

"&gt; Where was Kyrie? Phil Handy was befuddled. &gt;  &gt; It was the summer of 2013, and Handy had just joined Mike Brown's coaching staff in Cleveland. His first assignment—his most important assignment—was to work with Irving, the 2011 No. 1 overall pick, who was heading into his third NBA season. &gt;  &gt; Handy tried calling the number Irving had given him. He tried texting. He tried again. Nothing. For two weeks. Frustrated, he finally took a flight to Miami, where Irving was working out, to see him in person. Which, as it happens, was what Irving wanted. &gt;  &gt; ""He was challenging me in a sense, to see how I was gonna handle it,"" says Handy, who grew close to Irving in their four years together. ""It wasn't just a smooth start. This kid, he was very evasive, and he was doing it on purpose. We laugh and joke about it now, because we're well beyond it."" &gt;  &gt; Irving's explanation was simple, Handy recalls: ""I didn't know you.

This is a global pandemic.  Your individual choices affect the public health at large.  Some people have the privilege of only having to think about what's best for themselves.  Kyrie Irving is one of the privileged.  He's in the wrong.  But I don't know if he'll ever admit to himself that he's in the wrong.
So what is the goal and when can we toss it out? Because as it is now an unvaccinated player from another team can play all their home games AND play away games in Barclay's center as the mandate doesn't apply to them  But Kyrie Irving cannot play a single NBA game this season. Is that fair?
I'm starting to think this Kyrie Irving fella might be a huge chode

I can’t wait until Kyrie Irving is out of the league and realizes literally no one cares about his bullshit anymore
"Pat Tillman left his sport in his prime to serve his country in the Army, and lost his life doing so.  Kyrie Irving left his sport in his prime to protest a safe and effective vaccine towards a pandemic that's currently going on and has killed nearly 700,000 people in America alone."

"That sounds like the same dumb shit anti vax people say. “Google it” or “trust me bro” isn’t a very good source, I asked where and searching something like “is Kyrie Irving anti vax” or “Kyrie Irving not anti vax” sure doesn’t show much of anything saying he’s mad about jobs.

"For me, you cannot say KD or James Harden hitched their wagon to Kyrie.  Sure, they wanted to play with him, but they are both top 8 players and any team they are on is a championship contender.  The Nets are still the odds on fave to win the title. Every vet who came to the team after Harden did was hitching their wagon to all three of them, and I would argue that Kyrie was the smallest draw of the three.   To put it another way, if Kyrie Irving never left Boston, I think there is still a pretty good chance that KD and Harden end up on the Nets."
Kyrie Irving needs the psychologist  Get vaccinated
"r/nba has been ruined by vaccine quotes, change my mind.  I get it if it's news that actually impacts them playing in games, that makes sense. But who gives a fuck about what Marcus Morris thinks about the Kyrie Irving situation."
"&gt;One singular superstar and scrubs all lining up to support him is very very different from 3 super stars with one being Irving. Unless you’ve just only tuned into NBA recently, you’d know for everything that’s great about Kyrie... he will give you that “many headaches” leading to many heartbreaks and disappointments. Not IF, he will cause distractions and headaches. We’ll see whether or not they’ll be able to overcome the distractions.  Lol if you think this is bad, look at what the average NBA coach has to deal with. They can be scapegoated and fired at any moment (even if they’re good). They’d die to be in Nash’s position.  Nash’s only issue is dealing with Kyrie, which really isn’t that much of a headache because they don’t need him."

For that kinda bag they can use me as a human lab rat. Who the hell will want Kyrie Irving now?
"Why would you trust Simmons on his next situation?  Will Ben Simmons be a dramatically different personality in his new situation?   Kyrie Irving didn't want to play in Cleveland, with Lebron James, playing for a title every year.  He demanded out.  Then he went to Boston, and had a rift with the young stars (or someone), and made it very obvious that he wouldn't re-sign there in FA.  Then he got to his ""dream"" destination, and he randomly took time off last season to go to his sister's birthday party and now won't get vaccinated, so that he can get extra days off and not do his job.  These are character issues.  These situations don't dramatically change when you change franchise.  This is the person who has been married 3 times and thinks ""I'll eventually find the right one."""

"Even is there wasn’t this argument over vaccines, it would’ve happened eventually. Did anyone really think James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant could all play on a team and not have drama eventually?"
"It’s still a terrible situation all around, and it was before everything blew up in the playoffs. I’ve seen reporters speculate that maybe Simmons can “patch things up “ and ride out his entire contract, which is just about the dumbest take I’ve heard on this. Look. It’s not just about him not wanting to play there. It’s Philly for one and Philly fans aren’t going to forgive him. But it isn’t even that, really. Ben Simmons can’t play on the court at the same time as Joel Embiid and still be everything Ben Simmons is. Complain all you want about that, malign his character all you want, but that’s just a fact. As long as Ben Simmons is making $30M a year and having to co-exist in the playoffs with Embiid, the 76ers are not going to win a championship.  That’s the facts of the situation and everything needs to stem from those facts. Do the 76ers play him as much as possible to establish that he is in fact a very good player? Yes, absolutely. If they go through the deadline and haven’t moved him yet, even if he’s completely reconciled with Joel and Doc and bought s brand new home in the area and all that, if I’m a Philly fan I should be *pissed*. Every season you have Embiid on your roster is potentially the last season you get before his injury issues overcome him and he turns into something less than the pre-eminent post player in all basketball. You absolutely need to get a better fit than Simmons. You needed this last year and frankly you needed to trade him for Harden when that was a possibility. Now shit has hit the fan once and you probably won’t get Harden levels of talent back (maybe Kyrie Irving though) but he needs to be moved."

"Curious though, Sean Marks is known as an expert at rebuilding teams. So how long do you think he can rebuild the Nets back to a playoffs contender after losing James Harden and Kyrie Irving in 2022 off-season? They dont have picks from 2022-2027, the situation may be worse than 2015. The Knicks are a much better team now than they were back then and can make playoffs consistently, so this would increase the pressure for rebuilding nets too."
The greatest way to combat immaturity and stupidity is with diplomacy and intelligence. This statement shows the vast difference between Sean Marks and Kyrie Irving.
"I maybe should have said ""sounding and acting"" like instead of just ""sounding, but [this Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nba-anti-vaxxers-covid-1231988/) lists some of his nonsense, including:  &amp;#x200B;  Irving, who serves as a vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union, recently started following and liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan.”   ...  Earlier this month, Irving was forced to clarify a tweet that went viral for mysteriously declaring that ""My mask is off. Now take yours off. No fear.""  ...  Brooklyn’s “Big Three” are scheduled to speak on Monday morning at a league-mandated pre-season media day, which Irving skipped last year because, he wrote on Instagram, the media are “pawns.” Irving’s aunt expected him to discuss vaccine hesitancy in the Black community, as well as the tragic experiments on sharecroppers in Tuskegee, while “providing just as much knowledge and research base that you necessarily don’t have to take this vaccine — some of it is fake news, some of it is fake information, some of it is Doctor False-y, you don’t really know.” (that's apparently a dig at Dr. Fauci)  ...  Before he returned to his day job for the 2021-2022 season, Irving made a trip last month to South Dakota. His mother was born in Standing Rock, and he’d just finished enrolling for his tribal ID when he pulled up to a schoolyard at another Sioux reservation, unannounced, for signatures and selfies — the kind that force a fan to lean in tight and pull down her mandated facemask.       Inside the school, Irving met with two high-schoolers in a conference room for close talk about Covid and kicks, while twisting a cloth mask in his hands. He took photos in a basketball gym, where all student-athletes over 12 had been required to get vaccinated for the coronavirus to play sports, and where, on this Wednesday afternoon in late August, Irving was playing by his own rules.      “Pretty much everyone had a mask on,” says the mother of one student in attendance. “Everyone but Kyrie, everywhere he went.”      The superintendent insists that Irving and students had remained as socially-distanced as possible during his visit, but on the school’s Facebook page, only fake news remained: An administrator had Photoshopped crude paintstrokes over his nose and mouth, along with doctored masks on several bare-chinned students, because Irving had broken public-health protocol on government grounds.      “People seeing Kyrie on the rez,” the mother recalls, “even though we’re in a pandemic, I don’t think they stopped to be like, ‘Are you vaccinated?’ No, they’re like, ‘Damn, this is Kyrie!’ He’s one of our heroes.”  \----------------------------  In conclusion, F Kyrie Irving."
Kyrie doesn’t believe in anything except how special Kyrie Irving is.  We’re reading way too much into this.  He’s a selfish dumbski.

"Hard to imagine anyone trading for him at the moment tho. Dude was already injury prone and it seems these absences are more of a feature than a bug. Maybe the Nets feel like they can win it all without him (which they probably can) and they give him up for some bench pieces but since he's still very talented, not to mention BFF's with KD, they'd probably rather keep him on the off chance he gets vaxxed. A 40% chance at having Kyrie Irving on your already stacked team is probably better than anything they can realistically get for him."
"&gt;I want to be a voice for the oppressed, people who can't open their mouths without setting off laughter across the continent.

"I'd like to know what's keeping Kyrie from being that good. Outside of recent injury issues and the stigma that PGs can't win you chips, there aren't that many arguments against Irving not being a 1st option.   And let's say he isn't a 1st option. Irving could play Robin to Embiid or KAT if you can manage a trade.   Like I said before, if a team is desperate or crazy enough to believe they can handle Kyrie, trading for him should considered because he can still raise your ceiling to contender."
"nice PR  irving is not believed to be anti science  are we forgetting everything that has happened so far  Kyrie took this long to figure out a stance, didn't have mandates before so his stance was that hes an idiot"

A single injury of these not happening could / would have changed the outcome of the finals every single year. Doesn't matter if 10 or 1 happened, 1 is more than enough, just proved it to you.

And those are just the top of market names with annual 10-20+ game absences.  Tons more as you move down the food chain.  I'm not trying to make the case that Brogdon hasn't gotten injured a lot.  I'm merely pointing out that he isn't so far out of the ballpark of what is considered normal these days that it's not much of an impact on his salary.

If I could get a higher draft pick I would take Luka, but that wasn’t an option."
Those who are skeptical based on what their political party wants them to do are deluded.   Pretty much every noteworthy politician in North America is vaccinated. Even the ones championing  Kyrie Irving and motivating people not to get the vaccine are vaccinated.  Making vaccination status a partisan issue is nonsense.

"There is a highly active college basketball subreddit to discuss the NCAA championship in. The WNBA sub is barely active, because almost no one watches WNBA in the regular season.

"No. They just have the resources to provide alternatives for the vaccine that everybody else does not. If you provide a PCR test everyday like those NBA players (even the vaccinated) you should fell under the same category an unvaccinated Irving would be if he was allowed to play. I mean nobody got time for daily testing and isolation but the NBA player have to follow these rules anyway. Letting Kyrie play would set the case that people who can provide they are not contagious can enable in activities and even though I should think everybody should be vaccinated I can't see anything wrong with it. If you proof you are not spreading, why should you face restrictions? I am aware that for regular people this is no realistic option but just because regular people can't afford to use an alternative doesn't mean that the alternative is bs in the beginning."

"I think it's because having Ben Simmons, i.e. an elite defender and transition scorer, is better than having a dude who doesn't play.  Right now all of us affect Brooklyn's chances of winning as much as Kyrie Irving did.  I don't know about you but I'm a terrible basketball player.   I think if you invert your statement, it makes more sense, no one contending would trade for Irving.  The talent gap between whoever they send out and getting Irving in is way smaller than an empty roster spot and whoever Brooklyn is getting back."
"Kyrie got injured in game 8, against Butler.  It took Duke several months to find their identity without Kyrie. They ended up becoming a really solid defensive team, and had Nolan Smith looking like a POTY candidate, behind Kemba Walker, at point guard. Then ended up developing into a solid #1 seed and demolished a really, really good North Carolina team in the ACC Championship by smothering defense.  There was internet chatter about whether to even bring Kyrie back into the rotation after the team had finally found its identity behind Nolan Smith. But Coach K kind of shot that idea down at a press conference with his whole, you don't sit a guy like Kyrie Irving thing. Turns out that by putting Kyrie back in the starting lineup, it really messed with Duke's identity as a team, and they ended up getting pummeled by an Arizona team in a game that, on paper, shouldn't have been close."
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
"if I'm the Nets I'm shopping Irving hard to a team in a state/city with no vaccine requirements. Nets title window may not be open that long, why not get something for him, even if it's not near his level of talent, it's better than nothing. and really Kyrie is less than nothing for the Nets, because he's a distraction."
"&gt;   I call rubbish on this.  You're forgetting Kyrie chose not to play in the bubble and was actively lobbying NBA players to not play either.   That's probably when the Nets knew they couldn't count on him to toe the company line.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29304500/sources-kyrie-irving-play-key-role-friday-call-players  &gt; Irving, 28, has forged a reputation as a disruptor within his career, and that's emerging again at this crucial moment for the NBA. Irving's stance has pitted him against the league's establishment, including his former Cavaliers teammate LeBron James, once again. There's significant support to resume the season among the league's superstars -- most of whom are on playoff contenders -- and Irving seems to be relishing the clash."
"Its also seeps into alot of different cultures. Republicans, Democrats, Hood Life, White Picket Fence Life. All of them are quick to ignore facts in the face of their various narratives.   Kyrie Irving is either a total idiot, someone who likes to piss people off or both."
I'll need some convincing to believe that Kyrie Irving was signed just as a favour to KD.
Headline :Kyrie Irving talks about something he doesn’t understand.   In other news did you see how wet the ocean was today?
Why would anyone look to athletes for anything? No one does it for politics. They sure as hell won't do it now. Kyrie hasn't even been that public about it.  The only thing we know is what is being reported on. If people really feel that Irving is doing harm then maybe news reporters should not give him the coverage. But obviously anyone with a brain cell would know they are business first and lighting up a divisive topic will help their pockets. A lot fail to see that.
"Because he’s one of the few (and the biggest name) to not get vaccinated amongst nba players? And this is a sports subreddit about the NBA? And his actions directly affect the championship chances of a title favorite? Seems pretty obvious why it’s getting talked about, it’s not like they’re talking about Kyrie Irving during F1 broadcasts or something"
"Like most people who have pretzeled themselves over antivax bullshit lately, Kyrie Irving is mostly just saying whatever he thinks will allow him to dodge actually having to say that he thinks vaccines are bad or morally repugnant or kill thousands of people or whatever."
"The same ""mavericks"" who refuse the vaccine are always quick to go to the hospital like cowards. Im sick of these hypocrites and especially sick of kyrie irving he needs to be forced into retirement"
Plates are round and also flat.   - Kyrie Irving probably
"disagreed lol he's Kyrie Irving, 50/40/90 guy, a guy like that stopping shooting is borderline insane."
The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the Nets for Kyrie Irving then keep fingers crossed they don't have to meet the Knicks or the Nets in playoffs.
"What else will nephews like OP post about?   ""Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving are shit human beings, guys! Give me karma!!1""   By all means, personally attack the character of people you'll never meet on the internet to your heart's content, but don't let the facts get in the way of your narrative. Both players had underwhelming college careers? If they were that ""underwhelming"" for lack of play/availability due to injury in college, then shouldn't that appropriately reflect in their draft positions, yet they were still clear consensus number 1 picks? Talk about contradicting yourself in the first sentence of your mini essay."
"I feel like this is the easiest take to get to but one that misses the point  He most definitely knows what he believes, it just happens to be strange. Most people missed it from his IG live because they don't know or didn't pick up on it. This dude thinks he's part of The 5% Nation. So that he's part of the few enlightened people in the world and it's his responsibility to share it.   &gt;“This is one body that I get here,” said Irving. “One God body that I get here. And you’re telling me what to do with my body?”  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nothinbutnets.com/2021/10/14/brooklyn-nets-5-confusing-statements-kyrie-irving-instagram-rant/amp/  Theres a cultural gap I think that caused people to miss it coz as far as I can tell, only Bomani Jones &amp; Dominique Foxworth have discussed it as far I can tell. Pasted the podcast link if anyone is interested. 37 minute mark.  https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SQZ3XIUqtYklpcx2jZM9R?si=mOoHSGsHRVmfw_KcynDoIQ&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;t=2230"
"Not really. Since the lottery, Ewing took the Knicks to multiple conference finals and 2 finals, David Robinson took the Spurs to a conference finals and won 50 games like every year, Shaq took the Magic to the finals, Iverson took the Sixers to the finals, Duncan got the Spurs 5 rings, Lebron took the Cavs to the finals, Dwight took the Magic to the finals, Rose took the Bulls to multiple conference finals. Those are all franchise altering players. Then you’ve also got great players like Derrick Coleman, Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Glenn Robinson, Elton Brand, Yao Ming, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and KAT.   If you want to be relevant, then getting the number one pick is an easy way to do that. Far easier than trying to develop project players late in the draft like Giannis or getting big time free agents that only 2 franchises can actually get reliably"
"&gt;Kyrie Irving is a clown.  I'm honestly at a point where I'm just like ""Fuck Kyrie."" I used to love the guy...then I thought he was a weirdo, but I still liked him.  But believing the earth is flat...or asking people what does ""government"" mean to them is harmless. There are currently anti-vaxxers across the nation propping him up as some kinda hero while 1500 unvaxxed Americans die every day from COVID.    The clown show that is ""Kyrie Irving"" isn't funny anymore. Its sickening. Literally and figuratively."
You are the Kyrie Irving of fanbases
"People like Kyrie Irving are a danger to society. We gotta stop pretending that this dude is just some crazy dumb jock. He has 15 million followers on Instagram, that's a lot of people who might listen to his idiotic beliefs and go around killing people.   We're not talking about mostly harmless flat earth shit anymore. These sentiments are costing lives and people like him have blood on their hands."
Can no one ask a question Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving aren't a solid answer to? smh lol
" Everyone from Kyrie's family to his friends, to his team, to the media, has been lightly stepping around his beliefs as though shooting the basketball makes you a fucking philosopher.   Kyrie Irving legitimately believed, that the Moderna vaccine was part of an elaborate plot to hook up black people to a supercomputer controlled by Satan.  Not one word of that is a lie. Check the recent Rolling Stone article. This dude is straight up, pants on head stupid - and the refusal to call it out is condoning it, if not an implicit endorsement.  To compare this guy to Ali, who objected to a war that he wanted no part of, and to draw a comparison from Ali not wanting to put others in danger, to Kyrie - whose actions are DIRECTLY putting others in danger, is flagrant disrespect.  Kyrie Irving is a motherfucking lunatic, and anyone who supports this ridiculous media circus is a motherfucking lunatic too."
Kyrie Irving gunning for a r/hermancainaward
Kyrie Irving is a clown.
"Kyrie Irving is a jackass, plain and simple. He isn’t pure evil, but it’s obvious he’s stupid and uncooperative. Nothing he’s done has changed that perception in the last 5 years."
The Nets  don’t need kyrie irving
Kyrie Irving is totally giving them a voice. Think about it. Irvings news is hitting the front page. Everyone has an opinion for it. If a regular like you and me challenges the covid shots in any possible way you get buried with downvotes and a high risk of a ban. So when you deep think it Irving is very much a voice for those with opposing views.
"You keep saying how things seem to you..are you a black american? If the answer is no, than why are we talking about how those things seem to you? Are you vaccinated? If yes, than why are you talking about how that history seems to you? Starting with your trepidation about the weight of mandates..mandates may not be the principal reason a black american wont get vaccinated, but goddamnit someone coming from one of those institutions telling you that you must participate…do you think that would increase or decrease trust? On nicki and tucker..why do you mention tucker carlson? Hes not part of the medical community…im confused about why hes mentioned in a comment about the medical community and government telling black people they must get vaccinated. Please connect those dots because that has no sense to me. Also, have you ever been in a foreign country, needed medical attention, and doubted quality of service because of who is serving you? Would you take treatment in mexico on vacation for a [insert health issue] or would you opt to go home to your community and doctors? Or, even better…are you a black american, part of the community whose real history and real experiences would lead them to be skeptical of an overwhelmingly white [medical] institutions advice and overwhelmingly white governments mandate that you do something to your body? The way you speak (seems sorts dumb to me) indicates no way in hell you are part of that community. Kyrie irving i put in the category of idiot who thinks hes nostradamus and wants that control…buuuut hes also a black american. You can disregard real historical and community experience with “seems dumb to me” but jesus fuck is that lazy and unempathetic."
Kyrie Irving
"I liked the paragraph below, but it's weird to frame the mandate question later in the story as some unexplored territory, given that [kids have needed a bunch of shots to attend school for decades](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/08/states-have-mandated-vaccinations-since-long-before-covid-19/), that [17 different vaccines were required of soldiers before COVID](https://www.yahoo.com/now/17-vaccines-mandated-us-military-165900126.html), and that  [George Washington himself ordered inoculation of troops against smallpox](https://www.wral.com/fact-check-did-george-washington-mandate-vaccines-for-his-army/19807935/). Vaccine requirements for public health are not new, and one group has decided to make them a massive issue, to the detriment of everyone else, for political or personal gain.  *It was impressive when he pushed for the league to cancel the 2020 bubble season in the name of racial justice. But now that same instinct for standing on principle is leading him to … insist on his right to play basketball … in a public space … where there’s a higher chance to infect an at-risk person with a potentially fatal virus … even though he is not personally opposed to the vaccine that could defeat this virus … but only determined to preserve his “voice”? Really? The Nets are set to pay him more than $18 million in the coming season even if he sits out every game. I like Irving and want to understand this from his perspective (help me, Kyrie!), but it’s extremely easy right now to see him as a powerful, coddled person who’s confused his own quirks for a compelling argument.*"
"That team was the least enjoyable team I've watched in 40 years as a Celtics fan and I watched every game in 1997 and 2006-07.   Kyrie was actually playing great in the start of the season but the team was visibly off. They played dumb, selfish and unlikeable basketball.   So sad, because the summer before they were the most enjoyable team of the past 10 years without Hayward and Irving."
[Wojnarowski] The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to a trade with the Houston Rockets that will send Kyrie Irving to Houston in exchange for John Wall. Additional details still to come.
"One of the hard truths about that season that lots of Celtics fans don’t want to admit is that Brown and Tatum were very much complicit in the team’s struggles.   My take is that they both got massive egos stemming from the 2018 playoff run and they didn’t put in the necessary work to get better that summer. Brown was benched, and Tatum was wildly inconsistent. They needed a veteran to guide them that season, and unfortunately that guy was Kyrie Irving.   Fortunately I think the experience humbled the two of them and it caused them to put in extra work. That ultimately helped them become the players they are today."
Kyrie Irving is the Meghan Markle of sports
"That's a dope nickname.  Kyrie ""The Burden"" Irving"
Farrakhan is a very outspoken anti-Semite bigot. Those are the beliefs Kyrie Irving stands for.
I do legit search on YouTube “Kyrie Irving Max Kel…” rather than “Kyrie Irving First Tak…” so maybe that’s something.
I dont think you said it loud enough  #FUCK kYRIE IRVING
"&gt;	But Durant remains optimistic that the situation ""will work out"" eventually.  imagine wanting things to get worked out and its Kyrie fuckin Irving that’s holding shit up lmao"
"God, Kyrie Irving is such an insufferable dumb fuck"
"This. People want to talk about how Kyrie is all woke and about peace and love, but dude is a devout Farrakhan believer and an anti-Semite. Fuck Kyrie Irving."
"Really? Because in the last 5 years, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, D'Angelo Russell, and Goran Dragic have all been All-Stars. Point guard defense is greatly overrated. Westbrook and Harden have won MVP's while playing almost no defense. Dame is considered a top 10 player while being a bad defender."
"Kyrie ""Descartes"" Irving"
"currently producing more this season that Kyrie Irving &amp; Ben Simmons combined.  pump the brakes, the mans a national treasure."
"Honestly agree wholeheartedly. At this point it’s just virtue signaling mixed with a bit of smugness.   Kyrie ain’t swaying nobody, the same people that will use Kyrie Irving as an excuse not to wouldn’t have done it anyways(bet money he’ll be brought up on Fox News as a hero soon).   If you actually wanna help, speak to your circles in real life. I’ve had to call out people I know because they’re quick as fuck to hop on social media and shit on a celebrity but suddenly forget how phones work when their Aunt, or cousin is spouting off anti-vaccine nonsense."
https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/01/jj-redick-admits-to-kyrie-irving-he-might-not-believe-in-dinosaurs-and-knew-this-would-be-a-headline
"Kyrie Irving is a bad person and Ben isn't necessarily a bad person. But Ben didn't just play bad, like some players where there shot is just off and there's nothing you can do.   Ben neglected a crucial part of his game for years, refused every push by his teammates and coaches to get him to change, and got to the point where he's passing up open dunks in game 7.   Ben deserves the biggest chunk of blame, even if we agree Doc and Embiid deserve a share of the blame too. Ben's response is disproportionate."

"Fifty years ago, having a radio show would have required this guy have some sort of knowledge or talent or both. JJ Reddick has neither when it comes to broadcasting.   Second, Bob Cousy rose from a cold-water tenement in NYC, learned a game that wasn't on television, or even popular, only to revolutionize it with his style and talent. Before Bob Cousy bowling and horse racing were bigger sports than the NBA and it wasn't close. Cousy catapulted the NBA from obscurity, creating the modern NBA superstar without a blueprint. In the process, he formed the players union, and negotiated its first CBA , which paved the way for the players of today to make a living playing ball and not sell insurance in the offseason. In his offseason, he would travel the world, creating global interest in a game that was, to that point, limited to regional appeal. He was a spokesman for the game on tv and in movies and you can probably pinpoint basketballs global growth to him.   On top of it, he was an electric player, who embraced the street game and brought it to the NBA, creating the blueprint for every point guard from Pete Maravich, to Kyrie Irving.   Maybe Austin Rivers can bench press more, or hit more open shots but he is no Bob Cousy and there will never be another like him. Show some damn respect. Your history is your present you dumb bastard. I guess they don't teach that shit at Duke. They only teach you how to be an arrogant asshole."
Kyrie Irving is the best living example of the Dunning-Kruger effect
Kyrie Irving or Jaden Smith?  Who is the crazier “philosopher”?
"The thing you have to remember about Kyrie Irving, is that he’s an idiot."
"I love how y'all act like you're all about equality and listening to under represented groups, Yet if it's someone you disagree with, you're just as racist and insensitive as anywhere else on the internet.   It's not often you have someone like Kyrie Irving come around and your feverish hatred towards this man just shows how small of individuals you all are.  He gave a home to George Floyd's family, Donated $1.5 Million to WNBA players during the initial Covid lockdowns, Built a solar and water plant in Pakistan and numerous other philanthropic ventures.   It's honestly pathetic and shows how parasitic and toxic not only this subreddit is, Reddit as a whole. Go outside. Make some friends.   This man posts a symbol that's important to him and his culture which I'm sure you all Stan to care so much about, when in reality you just trash him and all other Naive Americans who find deep meaning in that symbol.  All the real ballers in the league have shown him nothing but support and respect yet all you keyboard warriors who couldn't hit a layup spend your entire days trashing someone Online, who you've never met, who has done more good for society then your entire family tree will do in their lifetime."
"Is everyone confused about Kyree Walker commenting vs Kyrie Irving posting? Or did Kyrie post that earlier and Kyree is just repeating it, so I'm the one that's missing something?"
I stand with Kyrie Irving
I have information that will lead to the arrest of Kyrie Irving
"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Kyrie Irving now has weapons of mass destruction."
Kyrie Irving is the new Green Lantern?
"Kyrie Irving.  Dude is as good as me in bball right now, because both of us arent playing."
Kyrie Irving the type of dude to think the movie National Treasure was a documentary
"Well, firstly I want to make it clear that I don't think KD is that much of a drama guy as many people talk about him, mainly comparing to Kyrie. BUT his time on Warriors really showed how he's tough to handle. I don't think there would be many teams and players that could deal with him as good as the warriors did (even tho there were beefs). Then you add Irving and Harden and these two might actually be even worse to deal with (not actually sure about Harden, his exit on Rockets was awful, but prior to that I don't think so)... Man, this Nets team is CRAZY good, even tho they lost Allen, LeVert and Prince as team options, imo they are clear favourites speaking by talent wise. The only way they lose is 'to themselves' and that's actually a very possible thing to happen, given the personalities of the 3 superstars. Gonna be really fun to see how this goes, how they act towards the NY media and even on the coaching staff lol. This Brooklyn Nets is one of the most interesting things that I've ever seen on sports, you have and ABSURD amount of talent, but with also a lot of drama"
"Kyrie Irving, President of the Flat Girther Society"
"I dunno, maybe the countless stories of his drama and unnecessary horseshit? Maybe him ditching the team and failing to inform them of his intentions? Partying with out a mask at a big party during a pandemic? “What does the word government mean to you?”  Did you seriously have to ask why someone might find Kyrie Irving irritating? Are you a delusional Nets fan?"
"&gt;Nets- trade Kyrie Irving to Wizards, future protected first to Clippers  What is this “future protected first”? Nets have traded every single pick they could, they have none to trade."
"Kyrie Irving on Harden coming to Nets: I don't really see Nets having a first option. KD could be a first option, Harden could be a first option, I could be a first option some days."
Kyrie Irving
"I mean, when you're surrounded by Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, J.R. Smith and Tristan Thomspon, it's kinda hard to be defensively efficient.  Defense is a team activity, and having watched a LOT of Lebron in Cleveland I can pretty comfortably say that his perceived laziness on defense was him feeling defeated because his teammates did not have a clue what they were doing. I think he just knew where they were supposed to be and reacted accordingly, but then people were out of position resulting in defensive breakdowns. After a while he shifted towards playing free safety because he knew better than to expect his teammates to make the right decisions.  Furthermore they really didn't have any rim protection after Mozgov, and having a defensive anchor at the rim allows perimeter defenders to more comfortably pursue their assignments aggressively since fucking up doesn't mean 2 points guaranteed.    This is all to say that there are likely a lot of reasons that Lebron 'regressed' on defense in Cleveland. The fact of the matter is that those teams were not equipped defensively, and it's not like he could really drag that team to a defensive culture with heads like Kyrie in the locker room; especially without the right pieces for a strong defense."
"I think Nash is an offensive wizard so I believe he will find a way to make it work but dealing with the personalities, the egos...the drama....that will be the hardest part. He already had the whole ""we don't have a coach"" disrespect coupled with the recent rumors (may be just that, rumors) of Irving never wanting him as coach.   If they all buy in and agree to lower their usage rates, if they lose the egos and focus on team ball, they can be fantastic. The odds of their styles not clashing...not good in my opinion. KD can play offball but Kyrie and Harden are extremely ball dominant and dribble heavy."
"You're just making things up.  &gt;The Cleveland Cavaliers reportedly were in talks to trade Kyrie Irving to the Phoenix Suns in a three-team deal in June, according to Jackie MacMullan of ESPN:  &gt;""In mid-June, shortly before [former general manager David] Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson.""  &gt;**That trade came a month before Irving requested one out of Cleveland**  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2752210-report-kyrie-irving-trade-for-paul-george-eric-bledsoe-was-explored-by-cavs  The whole reason Kyrie requested a trade in the first place is because he was included in trade talks."
"Kyrie Irving is indeed going through a bad situation.  It seems that he has already had a bad experience when the Nets hired Nash as a coach without consulting him.  Now that Harden is coming, Irving may take umbrage."
THIS JUST IN:   WORLD NEWS REPORT:  KYRIE IRVING IS A DIPSHIT THAT SAYS DUMB THINGS.
"Here are some things that were going on in that season just to put into perspective how long he was a rocket  ____ Kobe was somehow willing the Lakers into the playoffs  _____ Melo was a legitimate MVP candidate  _____ KD had just won his 2nd of 4 scoring titles ____ Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett were in the midst of their last season as Celtics before being traded to the nets ____ Kyrie Irving was coming off of a very strong ROTY season _____ Giannis Antetokumpo was averaging 9 points, 5 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 block per game for Filathlitikos in the Greek League. He was a Greek League all star that season _____ Jabari Parker, Aaron Harrison, and Julius Randle were the 3 highest ranked high school recruits (MaxPreps) _____ There's a lot more and if you think of anything else please add it"
"I *really* don’t envy the role players on this Nets team. You got Harden who is basically Lou to the rockets’ Will Smith (John wall being the little statue Will bought as a present), and Kyrie “gotta get some players” Irving. Imagine giving up your stats/potential-payday and doing dirty work in games for guys openly look down on anyone who isn’t a top tier superstar"
"The Nets need a championship for the trade to worth it.  The Rockets need the Nets to implode for the trade to worth it.  Not a bad trade for Rockets consider Irving is known for his antic so even if the Nets won this year, their later picks may still be good because who know what Kyrie will do."
Kyrie Irving doesn’t have to be the Alfred to Kevin Durant’s Batman and James Harden’s Robin. He can be Meowth while they’re Jessie and James.
Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA right now. Don’t sleep on Kyrie Irving winning a FMVP. He actually shows up in the Finals unlike Wardell Stephen Curry II.   The Brooklyn Nets have a chance to 4 peat. Kyrie Irving has a chance to go down as a top 25 player of all time.
Kyrie Irving
Stupid opinion? Maybe.  You're going to tell me kyrie Irving is a focused and dedicated athlete?
"One thing I can be certain of is that neither Kevin Durant, James Harden, nor Kyrie Irving, give two turtleshits what any media member or fan has to say. These years of Brooklyn Nets hate posts that are coming, are unnecessary."
He says he doesn’t want to speculate why Irving is out but in the next sentence he says he spoke to him?  He didn’t bother to ask why Kyrie wasn’t playing?
"https://mobile.twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1337038330278649860  You did last month  If you can’t read the article: &gt;	Sources said the Rockets have no interest in a Nets offer, unless it would include either Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving."
"Actually, screw the Batman-adjacent comparisons -- Kyrie Irving is G'nort."
You underestimate his audacity:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2018/01/03/the-time-kyrie-irving-responded-to-coaching-advice-with-thats-no-23s-job/amp/
"I don't really like the comparison of Lebron w/out Kyrie - cause Kyrie hasn't accomplished a thing without Lebron. Not to harp on it too much, but Lebron in 2015 willed 2 wins off the Warriors with Delly as his number 2 - that alone is more than I believe anyone in the NBA could accomplish.   This is from someone who believe Kyrie Irving is the second best PG in the league behind Steph btw."
"Jesus fucking Christ, the toxic cancel culture of our society knows no bounds. I definitely don't like Kyrie Irving but wtf is this? What are you requesting? We're really demonizing a guy for being in a Zoom call?  Fuck this shit, this does not help anyone."
"James ""I gave it my all"" Harden, Kevin ""The hardest road"" Durant, Kyrie ""too many quotes idk where to begin"" Irving"

"Real rockets fans def don't want to retire a jersey for a traitor who got everything he asked for, won nothing, and went off to play with KD and kyrie irving for a chip 🤦"
"I don't think he developed this ""I'm the great Kyrie Irving, how dare you speak to me"" attitude until he had those huge performances in the 2016 Finals"
"I’m saying if he wanted to play, he probably wouldn’t have been able to because they’re investigating him for the video.

"There's an odd obsession with trying to decide who will be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd option on this new Brooklyn team. It doesn't really matter. I never really think of basketball games this way. A way more interesting question to me is will they stagger their minutes, will we see all three of Irving, Harden and Durant on the bench at the same time or not? Also, where is Kyrie and does he plan on playing in the NBA anymore?"
Dame is literally the opposite of Kyrie Irving in terms of leadership and accountability
Wait: Kevin Durant is Batman James Harden is Robin should not Kyrie Irving be Batgirl and Deandre Jordan Alfred.
"Harden is under the most pressure because he's in the discussion for top 5 player and Kyrie Irving is not (KD has won before) He's done much more in the playoffs as a first option than Kyrie Irving has. He's had some individual games where he's fallen short, but never over the course of an entire series. He is nowhere near a zero in the playoffs. And he almost led a team to defeated the Warriors.  Has he delivered in the postseason like Kawhi, KD, Lebron, Steph? Not quite (though all of those 4 had shortcomings in their careers as well because nobody wins and plays perfect every single year of their career) But he is better than anyone else and has done more than anyone else besides those 4 guys as the first option in the playoffs."
"kyrie ""pizza time"" irving"
Nets have offered Kyrie Irving a 2-way G-League contract
"Durant 32 years old coming off an Achilles tear.  Harden, over weight and 31.  Kyrie Irving with the mental capacity of a rodent.  Most retirements in the NBA occur at 36. The next 5 years are the twilight years for your super stars.  The prime years for a player are their late 20s, and early 30s.  At best, you're getting 1 year of prime for  some of the players who are drastically unreliable.  What is the Nets subreddit going to transform itself into this time around? Didn't you guys just shut it down last time?"
"The Nets. They traded their entire future for James Harden. If they don’t win in the next couple of seasons with the Durant-Harden-Irving trio, they’re completely fucked since those guys at age 35 aren’t gonna get much back.   Kyrie Irving could also spontaneously retire and head to a distant mountain range to live the remainder of his days as an ascetic monk and then they’re completely fucked since with this defence, they’re gonna need to go full 2017 Cavaliers and absolutely obliterate teams on offence."
"As crazy as Irving is, I genuinely believe that with Harden's usage rate, were he to stay on the damn court and not lose his mind, he would put up significantly better numbers than Harden. What Harden does better than anyone in the history of the game is goat the refs into blowing their whistle for him. Other than that, he doesn't nothing particularly better than Irving. Harden's accumulated states are all better because he's on the court more, he's always got the ball, and he's been in the league longer. But Kyrie is a better shooter, both his 2's, 3's, and FT's are better than Harden's. **With Harden's usage rate Irving would be considered a top 5 player as well.**"
"""Are any of us truly 'in'?""  -Kyrie ""Socrates"" Irving"
"That doesn't mean he makes all the decisions though. It's clear he didn't want Kyrie traded.  &gt;According to the Athletic, when then-Cavs coach Tyronn Lue learned that the Irving trade was about to happen, he drove to meet James and put the latter on the phone with Cleveland General Manager Koby Altman. James was described as “adamant” that Irving should not be dealt away, and Altman reportedly assured the four-time MVP that the trade would not occur.  &gt;A few minutes later, it did, James discovered to his noticeable dismay. At an autograph-signing event in California, James “dropped the pen and slumped in his chair,” per Vardon.  &gt;James suggested that he felt he wasn’t deceived by Altman so much as the GM may have been overruled by Cavs owner Dan Gilbert. James also implied that Gilbert, with whom he had a frosty relationship dating back at least to the owner’s infamous “comic sans” letter in 2010, had ousted former general manager David Griffin to gain more control over his team’s personnel moves.  &gt;“Take nothing from Koby, because Koby [was just named GM], but at that point in time, you realize that Koby’s not the only one running the team, as [Griffin] had done, and that’s why Griff was let go, pretty much,” James said.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/20/lebron-james-cavs-kyrie-irving-trade-was-beginning-end-everything/  I think you should apologize, again."
"Kyrie requested a trade. The Cavs fulfilled it. Gilbert often didn't listen to Lebron that was the whole issue in Cleveland it's like you guys never paid attention to Lebron's 11 years on the Cavs.  &gt;According to the Athletic, when then-Cavs coach Tyronn Lue learned that the Irving trade was about to happen, he drove to meet James and put the latter on the phone with Cleveland General Manager Koby Altman.

"Are you even reading what you post? How does that make you right about LeBron trying to trade Kyrie?  &gt;**Team and league sources refute that, saying that it was Griffin who initiated the trade talks with Phoenix. Griffin, who is close with Irving, sensed both his unhappiness and his restlessness and was preparing for the possibility that Irving would request a trade. But once Griffin was no longer employed by the team, the conversations stalled.**  So Irving being convinced LeBron wanted him gone makes it so but the GM who was in charge of everything is simply lying about what happened?   And LeBron specifically [telling Altman](https://theathletic.com/660104/2018/11/19/lebron-james-cavaliers-trading-of-kyrie-irving-was-beginning-of-the-end-of-everything/?source=dailyemail) not to trade Kyrie - especially not to the Celtics is also just a fabrication?   &gt;James was adamant on the call - do not trade Irving, especially to the Celtics. By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur.  Like I said. You live in your own little world where things happen differently."
"That doesn't prove anything. Yes Kyrie assumed Lebron had approved trading him which incensed him and caused him to demand a trade himself, but Lebron was always against any Kyrie trades. There are multiple sources in this thread. For example  &gt;There was excitement in Cleveland for the pieces the Cavs got in the Irving trade. But as the season has unfolded, second-guessing has been developing.

"In my ideal Basketball HOF, Lowry would just miss the cut.  He's a 6x Eastern All Star (probably would only have 2-4 if he played in the West against Steph, Lillard, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Harden, Kobe, Luka, Tony Parker, Paul George for the AS guard slot), 1x All NBA and 1 title as a #2/3 option. He had a short but semi successful college career and one gold medal, but it's team USA so how impressive is that really. He's a solid player and any team would be lucky to have him, but he isn't a transcendent talent like Duncan, Dirk, Nash, Kobe, Chris Paul etc...  At his peak he still wasn't a top 5 player in his position. Steph, Lillard, Westbrook and Chris Paul were all clearly better than Peak Lowry (2015-2018) and then guys like Kyrie Irving, John Wall, 2017 Isaiah Thomas, James Harden (if you count his 2015-18 stint as a PG) are all in the same tier.  I think to make the HOF you should be absolutely irreplaceable and left a distinct mark in NBA history, and obviously this is just my interpretation, which means nothing. But Lowry as great as he was/is was replaceable."
"Lol at you   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why  In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson. No formal offer was made by any of the teams, but news of this potential transaction stung Irving, who, sources close to him say, became convinced that LeBron's camp, which also represents Bledsoe, orchestrated the trade talks.      Team and league sources refute that, saying that it was Griffin who initiated the trade talks with Phoenix. Griffin, who is close with Irving, sensed both his unhappiness and his restlessness and was preparing for the possibility that Irving would request a trade.

it was speculation on why Marks said that. “Marks said Kyrie Irving has been keeping up with his health and safety protocols and has been testing daily for COVID-19.” [source](https://twitter.com/alex__schiffer/status/1349762843441156097?s=21)

Kyrie Irving (out) - Torn Labia.
Kendrick Perkins is a media clown. The Brooklyn Nets are going to win the championship if Kyrie Irving plays and the Big 3 is healthy.   Kevin Durant is the best player in the league and the Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the league.   The Brooklyn Nets will sweep the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers in the NBA Finals.

"I love how all the media is trying to play down what the Nets pulled off.   ""Oh, they gave up all their picks!""  ""Oh, this team is mentally weak!""   ""Oh, they got no defense!""   This is KD, Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Obviously Irving will need to, you know, actually play, but this is **the** new super team.   The Warriors were two top fives in KD and Steph along with great top 20 players in Klay and Draymond.   This is again two top five players and Kyrie is at least top 20, and while Dinwiddie's injury sucks for them they still have other decent talent on that roster.   This is a **superteam** and right now I expect them to have a great shot of coming out of the east both this year but especially next."
"At that point he owned the Wayne estate. If this analogy were accurate, we can expect a future where Kyrie Irving owns an NBA franchise. Wouldn’t that be something."

Maybe don't base your health decisions on Kyrie Irving.
"You know I’m defending Kyrie Irving against the charge that he is a ‘dumb motherfucker’, right? You understand context?"
and this is without Kyrie fucking Irving lmao
Imagine if nets gave Irving + picks instead of talent + picks. It would have been a win-win because Rockets could have saved money with cutting Kyrie out if he does not play.
 So... when is Kyrie Irving gonna return?
"Kevin Porter Jr. and Kevin Love for Kyrie Irving really makes sense. With this trade, they only need another Kevin to surround James. Nets goal has always been to surround James Harden with Kevins."

"Full Text for people who can't access the article:  &gt;**Houston, Seattle Feels Your Loss**  &gt;*With whipsawing trades and other player movement routine in the N.B.A. these days, it’s hard to be loyal to teams and players.*  &gt;SEATTLE — If you’re a fan of the Seattle SuperSonics, jilted long ago despite decades of loyal love, you’re seriously happy for the last great talent from your team.  &gt;That would be Kevin Durant.  &gt;After a year spent rehabilitating a torn Achilles’ tendon, Durant now seems to be living his best life in Brooklyn as the leader of the Nets. His odds of winning a third N.B.A. title received a significant boost when a blockbuster trade reunited him this week with James Harden, his close friend and former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate.  &gt;Durant, Harden and Kyrie Irving on the same team? Scintillating, so long as they end up on the same page.  &gt;But if you’re a die-hard Sonics fan — and yes, count me in that group — the happiness felt for one of basketball’s transcendent superstars comes with a flip side.  &gt;We see Durant and are forced to reckon with all the unfulfilled possibilities.  &gt;Recall that the slim, do-everything forward spent his rookie season in Seattle. He was only 19, but he led the team through a dreary and uncertain 2007-08 season. He wasn’t just good, he was prodigiously good; so full of talent and joy that watching him made the doomsday talk of the Sonics’ possible relocation drift away.  &gt;Then reality hit. April 13, 2008. The last game played at the old KeyArena: a win sealed by a Durant jump shot.  &gt;Soon the team moved to Oklahoma City, where it began anew as the Thunder. (Pardon the crankiness, but they’ll always be the Tumbleweeds to me.)  &gt;It’s been 12 years, but the stinging questions remain.  &gt;What would have happened to Durant and our team if the Sonics had never left?  &gt;And how much should fans expect their devotion to be mirrored by professional sports leagues, team ownership and the players we most admire?  &gt;I’m typical of many in Seattle. The Sonics will always be in my blood. I’m comfortably middle-aged, but I can close my eyes and remember my first N.B.A. game: the bright colors and sharp sounds and even the smells of buttered popcorn and roasted peanuts in the old coliseum nestled near the Space Needle.  &gt;I was 6, and the Sonics were playing Jerry Sloan and the Chicago Bulls. I can still feel my father’s humongous hands as he led me to our seats.  &gt;A few years later, when my parents divorced, my father kept our connection close through the Sonics. We went to dozens of games, seated almost always near the rafters. We saw Julius Erving’s first appearance in Seattle — all that grace and power and coolness.  &gt;We were there in 1978 when the Sonics lost to the Washington Bullets in the N.B.A. finals.  &gt;In 1979, we watched Gus Williams, Jack Sikma, Dennis Johnson and my dad’s friend Downtown Freddie Brown as the team won its only league championship.  &gt;Years later, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton formed a powerful, legendary duo, but our hearts were always with those 1970s teams.  &gt;One more memory, this one bittersweet. When my father was dying, far too early at age 75, we rode together in an ambulance to a nearby hospice. I held his hand again as he spoke of our most cherished times. “The Sonics,” he said. Then he recalled, one last time, the glorious, arcing accuracy of Fred Brown’s jump shot.  &gt;That’s love.  &gt;I know I’m hardly alone. We bond over teams, over remarkable wins and searing losses and athletes who remain ever young in our mind’s eye.  &gt;Fans all over the country, who root for all kinds of teams and players, know that love. It is steadfast, faithful and rooted deep into our souls.  &gt;We also know the risk. There are no guarantees that devotion will be rewarded with loyalty in return. (Just ask the Houston fans who have stood behind Harden since 2012.)  &gt;Two years after my father’s death, the Midwestern ownership group that had bought the Sonics moved Seattle’s first big-time professional sports team of the modern era to Oklahoma.  &gt;The fact that the team had been a vital part of one of America’s greatest cities for 41 years did not matter. Nor did the fact that Seattle was known to have one of the most passionate fan bases in sports.  &gt;Nothing mattered but the bottom line. The N.B.A. wanted a fancy new stadium, and taxpayer money to fund a big chunk of it. Seattle’s political leaders balked. There was no compromise.  &gt;The city lost the Sonics and the one player everyone imagined as a franchise cornerstone. The one player who could have brought another title and forged more remarkable seasons, maybe for a decade or longer.  &gt;We have never relinquished our passion for Durant. He matured during an era of constant player movement that seemed to be foretold by the uprooting of the Sonics. He came to personify the modern superstar. He bounced from team to team to team, winning an M.V.P. and world titles and never quite content in one place. But to us he’s still the wide-eyed teen who conjured our last flash of basketball brilliance. We can’t let go.  &gt;It helped that he never forgot the city that birthed his N.B.A. career. When his Golden State Warriors came to Seattle for an exhibition in 2018, he wore a vintage Shawn Kemp jersey and gave the sold-out crowd all they could ever want to hear. “I know it’s been a rough 10 years,” he said. “The N.B.A. is back in Seattle for tonight, but hopefully it is back forever soon!”  &gt;Will that ever happen? To pine for it is to be whipsawed between hope and despair.  &gt;Whenever N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver utters a single sentence that could be divined as giving a nod toward the Sonics’ return — as he did recently when he spoke of league expansion as “Manifest Destiny” and gave a tip of the hat toward Seattle — the local news goes into overdrive with stories about a possible return.  &gt;Contractors are rebuilding the old KeyArena, soon the home of the N.H.L.’s Seattle Kraken, an expansion team. They have gutted the old structure. Close to $1 billion will go toward increasing its size and prepping it for multiple sports — pro basketball included. The whole endeavor is led by Tim and Tod Leiweke, brothers connected to the N.B.A. and Silver for decades who make no secret of their desire to have an expansion team playing in their gleaming new edifice.  &gt;Does all this mean the Sonics are coming soon? Maybe. But then again, maybe not.  &gt;So Sonics fans keep holding tight to the one last superstar to have played for our team.  &gt;He’s doing his thing in Brooklyn now.  &gt;And we’re still dreaming of the future.  &gt;I can see it now, in two years or maybe five, the SuperSonics back at long last. The first big free-agent signed to herald their return? Kevin Durant.  &gt;Sorry Brooklyn, there’s no such thing as loyalty in the N.B.A., but at least you would still have your team."
"I think they’ll get their turns through the course of a game as different guys sit. Harden and Kyrie will get their time to run a unit themselves and work the PnR with more frequency. All together on the floor it should be a fairly high tempo, free flowing offense - at least that’s been the case with Harden/KD and Irving/KD line ups.   Running simple motions and handoffs works just fine with those guys and the gravity they all have."

Time for r/nba to change its opinion about Kyrie Irving again
"Did i ever tell you about the time i went trick or treating with Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn nets? We did it May of last year.

"Tge nets have James harden initiating offense, Kyrie Irving playing lights out as usual (also people need to keep in mind Kyrie is a top 5-8 shooter in today's NBA ) and they have kd, they good"
You can be angry at Kyrie Irving for not showing up to do his job while appreciate him for his charitable efforts while also pointing out that he's probably one of the dumber NBA players. These things are all separate from one another.

I can still feel my father’s humongous hands as he led me to our seats.  A few years later, when my parents divorced, my father kept our connection close through the Sonics. We went to dozens of games, seated almost always near the rafters. We saw Julius Erving’s first appearance in Seattle — all that grace and power and coolness.  We were there in 1978 when the Sonics lost to the Washington Bullets in the N.B.A. finals.  In 1979, we watched Gus Williams, Jack Sikma, Dennis Johnson and my dad’s friend Downtown Freddie Brown as the team won its only league championship.  Years later, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton formed a powerful, legendary duo, but our hearts were always with those 1970s teams.  One more memory, this one bittersweet. When my father was dying, far too early at age 75, we rode together in an ambulance to a nearby hospice. I held his hand again as he spoke of our most cherished times. “The Sonics,” he said. Then he recalled, one last time, the glorious, arcing accuracy of Fred Brown’s jump shot.  That’s love.  I know I’m hardly alone. We bond over teams, over remarkable wins and searing losses and athletes who remain ever young in our mind’s eye.  Fans all over the country, who root for all kinds of teams and players, know that love. It is steadfast, faithful and rooted deep into our souls.  We also know the risk. There are no guarantees that devotion will be rewarded with loyalty in return. (Just ask the Houston fans who have stood behind Harden since 2012.)  Two years after my father’s death, the Midwestern ownership group that had bought the Sonics moved Seattle’s first big-time professional sports team of the modern era to Oklahoma.  The fact that the team had been a vital part of one of America’s greatest cities for 41 years did not matter. Nor did the fact that Seattle was known to have one of the most passionate fan bases in sports.  Nothing mattered but the bottom line. The N.B.A. wanted a fancy new stadium, and taxpayer money to fund a big chunk of it. Seattle’s political leaders balked. There was no compromise.  The city lost the Sonics and the one player everyone imagined as a franchise cornerstone. The one player who could have brought another title and forged more remarkable seasons, maybe for a decade or longer.  We have never relinquished our passion for Durant. He matured during an era of constant player movement that seemed to be foretold by the uprooting of the Sonics. He came to personify the modern superstar. He bounced from team to team to team, winning an M.V.P. and world titles and never quite content in one place. But to us he’s still the wide-eyed teen who conjured our last flash of basketball brilliance. We can’t let go.  It helped that he never forgot the city that birthed his N.B.A. career. When his Golden State Warriors came to Seattle for an exhibition in 2018, he wore a vintage Shawn Kemp jersey and gave the sold-out crowd all they could ever want to hear. “I know it’s been a rough 10 years,” he said. “The N.B.A. is back in Seattle for tonight, but hopefully it is back forever soon!”  Will that ever happen? To pine for it is to be whipsawed between hope and despair.  Whenever N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver utters a single sentence that could be divined as giving a nod toward the Sonics’ return — as he did recently when he spoke of league expansion as “Manifest Destiny” and gave a tip of the hat toward Seattle — the local news goes into overdrive with stories about a possible return.  Contractors are rebuilding the old KeyArena, soon the home of the N.H.L.’s Seattle Kraken, an expansion team. They have gutted the old structure. Close to $1 billion will go toward increasing its size and prepping it for multiple sports — pro basketball included. The whole endeavor is led by Tim and Tod Leiweke, brothers connected to the N.B.A. and Silver for decades who make no secret of their desire to have an expansion team playing in their gleaming new edifice.  Does all this mean the Sonics are coming soon? Maybe. But then again, maybe not.  So Sonics fans keep holding tight to the one last superstar to have played for our team.  He’s doing his thing in Brooklyn now.  And we’re still dreaming of the future.  I can see it now, in two years or maybe five, the SuperSonics back at long last. The first big free-agent signed to herald their return? Kevin Durant.  Sorry Brooklyn, there’s no such thing as loyalty in the N.B.A., but at least you would still have your team.  _Kurt Streeter is the new Sports of The Times columnist.

Question isn't who is better for your team chemistry.  It's who is the better player. I'm gonna go with the champion Kyrie Irving.
"the LA teams combining would probably be better, but the NY teams combining would be pretty close behind.  ___  correct me if im wrong cause i dont follow them, but the LA team would be  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Serge Ibaka  ___  while the NY team would be  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julius Randle  C: Mitchell Robinson"

""A lot of my friends [have helped]. Kyrie Irving bought them a house. Lil Wayne's manager bought them a Mercedes Benz. Barbra Streisand gave them stock in Disney.""

Kyrie Irving reminds me of the episode of of Community where Abed tries to prove whether Nicolas Cage is a good or bad actor. Kyrie Irving. Good? Bad?
"The coaches won’t pick him to be a fucking all star when he’s averaging 27/6/5 on 50/42/100? Do you understand how ridiculous you sound? This is kyrie Irving, a top 3 PG and top 15 player in the league and a top 5 most popular player.  .1 obviously he’s going to be a starter off of fan votes, he’s been a starter since 2017...  .2 say the 1% chance happen and he doesn’t, why would the coaches not pick him to be an all star based on him missing 5 games in the beginning of the season? 🤔That doesn’t change his on the court talent"
"Kyrie Irving grew angry when he entered the locker room and realized the team gave his old locker to James Harden, who was acquired in a trade. Irving, whose locker was moved to the wall where the younger, end-of-earth players reside, began yelling and at one point threw sage."
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
Reading more into it cause I always enjoy a laugh. The Cavs tried to downplay it and say it was an errant elbow from Corey Brewer that injured Kyrie.       https://www.sbnation.com/2013/11/13/5102082/kyrie-irving-catches-an-elbow-to-the-face-leaves-the-game
"People ""put up"" with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving because they're really fucking good at basketball. I think Kevin Love is a great example for people on dealing with success and mental health problems. I'm not trying to belittle there experiences in any way. When you become a headcase first and basketball player second the league will wash you out pretty quick (Royce White)."
Yeah except instead of Kawhi it’s KD. Instead of PG it’s Harden. And then they have Kyrie fuckin’ Irving. Oh and then there’s Joe Harris who is one of the best shooters in the league. Any gaps they have will be easily filled in the buyout market. They don’t need much.  I swear people are just ignoring that this is an unbelievably stacked team. And nobody wants to admit it because we were all stoked about parity after KD wrecked the league for a couple years by joining the Warriors. And yet here we are.
Fun fact: Dion Waiters and Kyrie Irving got into a fist fight in the Cavs locker room
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
Yes because you should be taking your medical advice from Kyrie “The World is Flat” Irving
"That is fair, I am not arguing against Parker as, like I said, I didn't watch much Spurs. I know he's an all-time great player, I just don't know the specifics of his game, so I'm not gonna comment on him.   But Kyrie Irving? He's certainly got more finesse around the rim, but he's not a ""way better finisher"" than Russ is."
"Yet that is basically the argument against Westbrook. Russ' shot worse near the rim in his earlier seasons but nobody mentions that, they just blankly state he's much inferior to Kyrie fucking Irving at finishing at the rim.  I swear, when it comes to hating on Westbrook this subreddit becomes detached from reality."
You people are making this way too complicated. First off if they aren’t a great team then they aren’t a superteam. Superteam has no meaning now. And yes kyrie irving/James harden/Kevin Durant is a great team. The nets could make no moves from here on out and I’d easily take them to win the east. It’s just not even close.
"Not a role player, but Kyrie Irving would be a league MVP if he played against the Spurs every game."
"They can actually go big and sign someone like Bradley Beal straight up, IF he demanded a trade which i dont think the Washington Wizards would say No to, if Kyrie Irving is made available by the Nets. Or they can be smart about it, get some back up bigs  plus some draft picks. Did i sell low? I dont think so, the nets just gave up Jarret Allen and Caris Levert having some draft picks would serve them well in whatever situation they may be next season. Well Its actually hard to say when execs and front office view Kyrie as a huge distraction on and off the court. But the man can play no doubt so it would be interesting if wherever he might end up."
"Kobe - many people used to despise him. Later in his career, he became a much more beloved figure. Kind of the reverse of Kyrie Irving.  Chauncey B-B-B-Billups - from general afterthought and possible bust, to Finals MVP of a team with no superstar. Dude almost won 2 rings before even being voted an All Star  Dwight Howard - from the best C in the game, to a guy who didn't take the game seriously enough, to seeking redemption as a champion for the Lakers"
"the hand checking rule is why offenses are what they are now. that and he carrying rules changing. bob cousy had to basically smack the ball down, from the top, every time he dribbled. since AI pretty much, guys can kind of hold the ball which allows you to have a Kyrie Irving or any of these other guys with nasty handles. now you've got the gather step and all this extra shit that wouldn't have flown twenty plus years ago."
"They literally are  Parker was a 65% shooter at the rim, Kyrie is 61%, Westbrook 59% (playoff stats are even more telling, Parker 62%, Irving 57%, Westbrook 53%)   And Parker played in an era with a lot of bigs and at one point had more points in the paint than bigs like Shaq    Westbrook is a superior athlete to both, has more dunks than both combined yet he is a way worse shooter at the rim because his touch there is pretty heavy"
Are you making a joke or are you actually calling Kyrie Irving a role player?
"Top 10 NBA players  (in order).   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić.  The Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the NBA."
Kyrie Irving?
"We'll have an elite scorer on the floor at all times, usually 2-3. Yes the post scorers are a problem but instead of asking how the Nets will guard one player, I think it's more appropriate to ask how are other teams going to stop 3 players who can score any way they want. Odds are at least one of these guys will have it going on a nightly basis.   I know the defense is an issue but if they buy out a big man, depending on who, there's really no way to stop this big 3 from lighting up any team in the league.   Also just gotta get it in so we agree on something, I absolutely hate Kyrie Irving lmao."
[Grady] Kyrie Irving is questionable. Also he might be playing in tomorrow's game.
"The Hawks.  Trae Young is a better player than Luka Dončić. Trae Young will also have a better career than Luka Dončić. Cam Reddish is a decent player, but he is not a Kyrie Irving stopper."
"Trae Young should be one of the favorites, but the media doesn’t like him like that.  Kyrie Irving has been the best player this season so far, but there is no chance he wins MVP because the media hates him."
"Blake Griffin? I think he doesn’t look good at all. It just makes me sad watching him play now and seeing the way he moves. He’s lost so much of his fluidity and explosiveness it’s crazy.  My list is KD, Lebron James, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, and Jayson Tatum."
"Basketball Reference has a HOF probability page [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html). Active players are in **bold** in the table.   I can see 3 active players below 30 years old: Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo."
I feel like any conversation with Kyrie Irving could be entertaining at least.
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, and Kyrie Irving. Doesn't support your point."
"&gt; Steve Nash said he does not know why Kyrie Irving won't play tonight against the Sixers, as in, he is unaware of what KI's personal issue is. Nash said he reached out to Kyrie and did not hear back  :hmm:"
Why is everyone dissecting all these interview answers from Harden? It’s not like he’s Kyrie Irving  Stick to the r/nba content handbook
BREAKING: Kyrie Irving to miss rest of season (excessive wokeness)
At one point in the college season.  Perry Jones was the #1 overall pick in mock drafts over Kyrie Irving.
They can beat the nets. Don’t underestimate the power of a Kyrie Irving implosion
Or Mo Williams being traded for the pick that became Kyrie Irving
"Ok, that is fine for you to think.  But there is literally no reason for that to cause the reaction people had to Kyrie yesterday. It's pretty obvious none of them actually have concern for Nash not getting a reply in 30 mins and just want an excuse to pile on Kyrie Irving on the internet."
Wardell Stephen Curry II was never better than Kevin Durant. I’d take Kyrie Irving over Wardell Stephen Curry II right now. Embarrassing post.
"“Because I think Kyrie Irving is dumb, any personal issue he has is dumb too”  Jesus Christ ... this sub"
Because Kyrie Irving said the earth is flat doesn’t automatically mean whatever personal issues he’s having are stupid or silly.   He has earned the trust of the people. It’s just that the people pick and choose what to focus on. It’s not like he has a history of missing games for stupid reasons either.   And this isn’t speech. This isn’t some quote. This is him missing a game due to personal reasons. Of course I’m going to assume he’s innocent. He hasn’t done this before. That’s literally the most logical way of thinking LMAO.
2017 NBA Finals Game 3- Kevin Durant vs Kyrie Irving  One of the best games I’ve watched.
"8th best player in the NBA.  I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving."
&gt; Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.   When the Nets get swept by the Lakers because Kyrie goes MIA he will retire like a coward and leave KD hanging
Do people really expect the NBA Finals to not feature the Brooklyn Nets and one of the Los Angeles teams? Embarrassing.   As a Kevin Durant fan... I want the Los Angeles Lakers. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving will get their damn respect. Kevin Durant will be the best player in the world soon and Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.  Nets in 4.
Too bad I couldn’t take off the last two days from work treating Covid patients while I directly deal with the virus and depression while this is also going on. Does Kyrie have any special or direct connection to these events or is being Kyrie Irving a good enough reason?
Have you not been paying attention to kyrie irving: the melodrama?
Nikola Jokić was born with the clutch gene. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league though.
"Yeah, but it was a player named Kyrie Irving, so I'm not sure what your point is."
"Plenty of people are questioning the source, maybe rightly, but did anyone actually think it *wasn’t* because of the capitol stuff? Maybe by coincidence he had some personal emergency on the 7th, but I thought we had all predicted that Kyrie “what does government mean to you” Irving was going to do something dramatic in response."
If I could pick any point guard this season to give me the best chance of winning a championship.... I would pick Kyrie Irving. Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA. He shows up in big games too.
"Kyrie Irving is our for tonight’s game. Due to personal reasons, no further details currently available.    The guy doesn’t want us in his personal/private life, that’s fine. I’m sure he’ll tell the nets at some point and they’ll respect his wishes as wel"
"Look, I understand Nets nation wanting to believe otherwise--and as well they should, it's their right as fans of the club.  But kyrie irving is going to implode the nets and KD is not the right personality to help evade that happening.  Nash is, and the FO is sound, but i have to believe it's just a matter of time."
" Ginobili largely developed overseas. He was a draft and stash player. It took him a few years to actually come over to the NBA after he was drafted, so by the time he did he was already well-established internationally and really polished for a rookie. He made the all-rookie team his first year, and it was clear from the get go he was going to be very good. He wasn’t really under the radar anymore by the time he started playing in the nba. The spurs shouldn’t get all that much credit for developing him really.   Tony Parker is a totally different story. He was super raw and young. I think he still holds the record for youngest player to start for the Spurs at 19. But he had flashes, was super fast, lightning quick, and could stop on a dime unlike anyone else. I think it’s safe to say that he was unique enough that Pop and co. knew that had someone special.    In my opinion, one reason tony was developed so well is because he played alongside Tim Duncan and a group of veterans. The role players on the 2000s spurs were known for being kinda old, cerebral, and experienced players. Guys like Michael Finley, Brent Barry, Robert Horry, etc. who had been in the league for a while already. The veterans plus Tim Duncan (who in my totally-not-biased-as-a-spurs-fan opinion is perfection incarnate) were able to help cover for a lot of mistakes Tony made, which gave him some room to develop and take a bit more risks. And then Pop would aggressively point out every single one of those mistakes to him. Luckily, Tony responded well to that, and soaked up those lessons.    You also have to consider that the Spurs overall front office strategy is different from a team like the Lakers. The spurs aren’t going to get a lot of talent in free agency, so they have a larger focus on in house development and have never really been one for making big trades or taking really any risks. They’re very patient and conservative. Popovich also really values continuity which helps a lot with development as well.    &gt;	it's just crazy that the Spurs stuck with them and developed them for YEARS without everything splitting apart.    This is the luxury of having maybe the best coach of all time alongside a top 5-10 player of all time. In Duncan’s prime, its really easy to put a group of players around him thats a perennial playoff team. There’s no panic to get better quick, and there’s no reason to take big gambles that might not pay off. That kind of continuity is really valuable to a developing player.   &gt;	What is a modern player you could compare young Tony Parker or Ginobli to?  In terms of play style, I have no idea. I genuinely don’t think there will ever be a player like ginobili again. His mix of high-IQ play and total chaos is really really unique, and I don’t think any player will replicate that again.   I can’t think of a good comparison to Tony Parker either. He was also a very unique player. Someone said de’aaron fox because of his speed and quickness, but other than that they’re really different. You could maybe say Kyrie Irving without the jumper? In that Tony got to the rim easily and had really creative ways to finish. He didn’t break defenders down the way kyrie does though, he just blew by them with a quick crossover. Also, rather than contorting his body in weird ways to get a shot over a shot blocker, he relied more on unconventional timing and quick releases to get his layups/floaters out of his hand before the shot blocker had a chance to contest.    In terms of development, I think Tony Parker may be like like Bam Adebayo? You can see what makes him special right away, but for a while it just wasn’t quite there. But each year he gets better and better, and his organization has really bought into his talents and backed him up. I don’t watch the Heat a lot, but that’s kinda the vibe I get from him. Someone who watches him more often feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.    This might be the homer in me, but I think Tony Parker is the best non big man finisher at the rim in the history of the NBA. He’s almost certainly the best under 6’4”. I can’t think of anyone who can create space in the restricted area the way he did."
"Who knows? But Kyrie Irving is the only player in the league who could be out for personal reasons, and people would just assume it’s something stupid. TNT knew what they were doing by using that dumbass Scoop B quote"
"If we go by what kyrie says, it seems like he’s super at peace with that whole thing.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.etonline.com/kyrie-irving-defends-ex-kehlani-after-cheating-scandal-in-heartfelt-instagram-post-104362%3famp  It honestly doesn’t read like lip service, It does read like kyrie said it though. So be prepared for that at least"
Uhh last time I checked he hasn't been wing any anything kyrie Irving related ever. And he close with kd.
Meet Kyrie we don't need a coach Irving.
I think Kyrie Irving wants to play for the Rockets.
"It wasn’t cause he was upset.. it’s because he’s Kyrie Irving . If we sat out from work it doesn’t make a statement, he does not have the same self interest"
You’re born with the clutch gene. Luka Dončić is not clutch. One game winner against Reggie Jackson doesn’t prove anything.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are clutch. They were born with the clutch gene.
why dipshits like you feel the need to suck the dick of centi-millionaires like Kyrie Irving is beyond me. the guy is here to do a job. one that he gets paid hundreds of millions of dollars for. part of that job is being in the public eye. people are allowed to react if he just bails on him team without even letting the coach know what's going on.
Welcome to the Kyrie Irving experience!
"Does anybody actually call him KI? I've heard Ky or Kyrie or Irving or Uncle Drew, but not KI."
"Kyrie ""William Farr"" Irving"
"Kyrie Irving on who he likes to question in the USA aside from the Astonaughts: ""I like questioning government. The concept is a lot of fun to question. Its creativeness, its authority, its meaning - its a lot of fun to question."""
Regular season player. Not impressed. Would like to see him do it it in the playoffs.   Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.
When did Kyrie Irving become KI? It's exactly the same syllables as Kyrie or Irving. Can we please just stick to either his first or last name?
I heard that the crowds storming the capitol building had a change of heart when Woj tweeted Kyrie Irving (personal reasons) OUT vs Philadelphia
"2014 - The Cleveland Cavaliers draft Joe Harris 33rd overall.  2016 - Cavs trade Joe Harris to Orlando Magic for a 2020 2nd round pick. Magic waive Harris immediately. Nets sign Harris.  2018/2019 - Harris wins 3 point contest and finished regular season leading league in 3PT%  2020 - Joe gets extension in BKN. Gets a Starting role alongside Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  I know there is no way they could have possibly known what was to eventually come from Joe Harris, but Cavs and Magic gotta be at least a little bummed that they had this dude and let him go."
Kyrie Irving x Brandon Knight’s ankles 🤷🏻
"Yes, and we should certainly give KYRIE IRVING the benefit of the doubt in all strange, unexplained scenarios."
Kyrie Irving - Deactivated   Kyrie Swerving - Activated
"Because not playing a game due to a personal matter and not wanting to divulge it to your coach that you know for a couple of months makes you an asshole. You literally have zero information on the matter and you are calling him an asshole for not wanting to talk about a PERSONAL ISSUE, i don't think you know the definition of what a personal issue is.  Kyrie Irving could discover the cure for cancer and idiots on this sub would still call him an asshole for being who he is."
I'm not criticising Kyrie for not playing tonight. I would say however that it would have been very interesting to see him against Embiid and Simmons. I feel like elite agile skilled guards like Irving could potentially be the weakness of this Philadelphia team on defense.
Welcome to the Kyrie Irving experience
"&gt; ""I sent him a message in the last half hour and haven't heard back yet,"" Nash said. ""But obviously thinking about him and hope that all is well. It's a private matter.""  [Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30670076/brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-vs-philadelphia-76ers-due-personal-reasons)    Nash didn't say his player isn't talking to him. Just said he hadn't heard back in the 30 minutes since he sent a message."
"Hard to say if this is Nash showing he is still green as a coach? Or if the situation is boiling over already and Nash feels he needed to publicly call out Irving.  I mean if im the coach, im pretty pissed my player isnt in the arena with his team mates. He did the same thing in Boston he was hurt for the first playoff run so he just didnt show up.  Maybe he has a legitimate reason tonight, but if the reason was flakey id be pissed if i was Nash.  You dont havento play if you dont want to, but you need to be here to support your team mates man not showing up because your not playing is unacceptable (again unless there is a legit reason. I just find it hard to believe Nash would say this if it was a legit reason, it sounds like this is Nash biting his tongue not wanting to say the words protest or needing time after the invasion of Capitol hill, or dealing with mental wellness issues. Just saying i dont know is better than telling everyone Kyrie is to sad to play today)"
What do you mean “wait and see”? We are literally *seeing*!! Kyrie Irving is a top pg of all time but god damn this mother fucker is so annoying I would hate having him on my team right now
"&gt;	The Cavs team that the Pacers played in 2018 was a much much worse edition than the Cavs team that the Pacers played in 2017.  &gt;Seriously, how can you even make this comparison? In 2017 Kyrie was averaging 25 a game, Love was still an excellent 3rd option (minus the finals) and the team was deep with role players beyond LeBron.  &gt;In 2018, Love was a shell of himself compounded by injuries and mental health issues, the team had been blown up at the TDL just a couple months prior to the playoffs thanks to LeGM, and they were the worst defensive team in the league.....despite being a top 4 playoff team.  &gt;That same Cavs team needed 7 games against the Celtics lead by a couple kids who were without two of their starters- one of them Kyrie fuckin Irving lol.  the above is a bit over the top but that a seven game series in 2018 is their biggest playoff success since 2014 doesn’t say much tbh"
"i can't wait to see my favorite players, seth curry and kyrie irving, going head-to-head in this playoff preview!!"
Why the fuck isn’t Kyrie Irving playing? Really. Any real reason?
"when the pacers had a first round exit to a cavaliers team that was significantly worse than from the previous year when they had kyrie irving and a healthy kevin love? that team was taken to seven games by a kyrie-less celtics, and then got swept in the nba finals. i don’t see the overachievement here tbh"
This is Kyrie Irving we’re talking about. You expect him of all people to act like a normal person?
"Weird Kyrie Irving is the hill you wanna die on, but hey live your best life."
"When you have dumbasses like James Harden and Kyrie Irving getting caught being stupid on camera, it’s hard to justify that it’s spreading from team to team"
Draymond Green winning the tip off against Myles Turner at the end of the game sums up how clutch Wardell Stephen Curry II has been his entire career. Aaron Holiday just stole that ball away from him. Wardell Stephen Curry II was not born with the clutch gene.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league. They were born with the clutch gene.
You mean the great philosopher? That Kyrie Irving? Incredible
I'm a Sixers fan and I'm annoyed by him since the Dion Waiters - Kyrie Irving duo claiming they were the best backcourt in the NBA. Imagine now that this dude just keeps fucking franchises over and over.

"For sure, he's clearly trying to force his way out to get what he wants. Its not like he always acts like this every year when he was leading Houston to WCFs.. people are acting like he's Kyrie Irving or something  The Harden-Simmons trade is a matter of time, seems like both of them are intentionally lowering their trade value as of late"
People pay attention to his crazy shit because he's NBA superstar loonie Kyrie Irving. When he becomes That Idiot Who Decided To Stop Playing In The NBA Kyrie Irving spitting out flat earth bullshit I bet lots of people will just stop paying attention.
"If the Lakers can take the regular season seriously, then nobody has an excuse. Last season and this season count for real. If people like James Harden and Kyrie Irving aren't even fucking trying, it's not because the regular season doesn't matter. It's because they're not professional."
"I honestly can't believe how blatantly disrespectful this guy is to the org paying him 34m per year to ""play the game he loves"".  He either has a serious issue(s) which he needs to deal with and I respect that but dont string your teammates along. Take the time for it and come back when you are good.  This is becoming a joke - there needs to be a Kyrie Irving rule to not allow this type of shit lol."
"But that's not Kyrie Irving, that's Kai Irving"
Kyrie Irving: I'm the worst teammate in basketball!  James Harden: Hold my double big mac.
They don’t play defense and their best player is Nikola Jokić. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are better players than Nikola Jokić.  First round exit at best. I’ve been saying it before the season.Embarrassing that you blog boys think you’re smarter than me.
"Can you not read or something?  &gt;Durant came to the Nets because he wanted to play alongside Irving, and the two of them wanted their good friend DeAndre Jordan to be part of the deal as well, but playing for Atkinson does appear to have been part of the equation. More from Charania:  &gt;Durant and Irving never connected with Atkinson and there was a growing belief that they did not have interest in playing for him when this team is whole again next season, sources told The Athletic.  Pretty explicit that Durant and irving didn't want to play for him from the beginning and that's why he was fired.  And I thought I laid out exactly why you ""wouldn't do that"" and now look where they are. Kyrie was hurt most of last year and now he's quit on the team. Basically confirms everything I said."
Zach Lavine for Kyrie Irving?
Rev up your Collin Sexton &gt; Kyrie Irving hot takes everybody
That’s not impressive at all. I would like to watch him shoot a dagger in the Finals like the one Kevin Durant hit on him in Game 3 of the 2017 NBA Finals.  He wasn’t born with the clutch gene. Ray Allen and Kyrie Irving hit clutch shots to save his legacy. Regular season bets are kind of embarrassing. Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA right now.
[Kyrie Andrew Irving]polar
Cuz he’s Kyrie fuckin’ Irving
"""Fuck Brooklyn"" ~Masai Ujiri  ~Kyrie Irving"
Kyrie?? That’s clearly KAI Irving you illiterate pawns 🙄
I support Kyrie Irving.   Richard Jefferson can keep sucking off LeBron James.  I mute all the NBA games I watch.
"I honestly thought Kyrie dipped due to the capitol protests and that would've been fine with me, but this mfer did basically the exact opposite of that lol. Fuck Cryrie Irving, he's an attention/virtue seeking baby that quits on his team whenever he feels like it."
"Why can't this brotha just be talented, rich, famous, young, and photogenic, without a hitch?  If I woke up as Kyrie Irving, I'd be content as hell with what relatively-few requirements the NBA has for me, in order to have a great life."
Kyrie Irving? Never heard of him.
I think Nash is generally happy about the non-Kyrie players. KD looks like his old self.  It's just that Irving and his mercurial self are a headache on their own.
"I'm going to give the HOT take that I completely understand the desire to understand what the heck Kyrie Irving is up to and why he's behaving the way he is right now  HOWEVAH  If the issue is that he's making $35 million and we therefore have a right to know where he is or why he's in the wind, I really wish this standard were applied to the billionaire owners whose comings and goings we know nothing about and who essentially never sit to take hard questions from the media about their business or personal lives.  So I don't think his salary is actually the distinguishing factor here."
"Allow me to break it down for you:  The  organizer of the event Tahanie Aboushi tweets  *Woah! Amazing turnout tonight at our organizing program launch!*  Kyrie ""Kai"" Irving is seen in the Zoom screenshot  Mallika retweets the Zoom shot with Kyrie.    To which Woj responds ""That's definitely a great turnout"" in a sarcastic manner considering Kyrie has been MIA.  It has absolutely nothing to with Linda Sarsour or Farrakhan or Biden's campaign you nitwit.  This is Woj tweaking Kyrie."
"if kyrie irving is able to leverage his fame and wealth to help get Aboushi elected to DA then yes that is the path to social justice, quite literally"
Kyrie “Andrew Bynum” Irving.
"The commisioner of the Kyrie Irving basketball league is going to have a problem when the biggest star of the league, Kyrie Irving, goes awol. Power Forward Lavar Ball is going to have to raise his college scoring average of 2.2 pts/game a little higher or the league will not do well."
How many times has he found his foot in his mouth and had to backtrack? Kyrie Irving does not have the gift of foresight.
Pablo Prigioni &gt; Kyrie Irving  Tell me I’m wrong
Kyrie “Ferris Bueller” Irving
"That's not what you said though you said, ""Unless he's donating all of his paycheck to starving families, I do not think you can call Kyrie Irving a good guy."""
"Thousands of Americans are still out of jobs and he's making more than any of them would make in their lifetime to not do his job. Unless he's donating all of his paycheck to starving families, I do not think you can call Kyrie Irving a good guy. Not at this point. Proud, absolutely. Giving, without a doubt."
Kai Irving was spotted. Kyrie Irving could be doing anything at the moment
"Kyrie ""WTF"" Irving"
"Kyrie Irving is an absolute hall of fame talent, but what a disgrace he’s been at times in his career."
"I love seeing people calling out and documenting his ridiculousness. As a lifetime Celtics fan, the tornado that is kyrie Irving is just devastating to a team. Glad to see it wasn’t just the Cs fans feeling this way."
https://sportsnaut.com/kyrie-irving-posts-cryptic-mood-post-instagram/amp/  Remember his Instagram post right after they won the championship too
"They are investigating the fact that he was out with no masks ... just like they did with Harden. Not the fact that he missed games due to a personal issue.   You actually must hate Kyrie if you think Kyrie Irving missed 4 games to attend 1 birthday party. The team called it an “issue” and KD said “we support him”   Like you call it excuses, but it’s basic logic. No bro, Kyrie didn’t miss 4 games to attend one birthday party lmfao. Use your head."
"Kyrie releases statement:   ""Nets GM Kyrie Irving is very happy with the actions of Coach Kyrie Irving and Player Kyrie Irving.  Now that Kyrie is performing three or more roles with the organization, we have decided to triple his salary."""
I didn’t hear it until the end when he said “he’s Kyrie Irving who are we”
"""we have to, you know ... bow at the alter of Kyrie Irving.""  LMAOOO"
"“I feel like i’m living my life on a flat circle, i’ll go to the club, i go back to the local QAnon meeting.”  -kyrie irving"
"I think I've already written this in the last few weeks, but forget about the Nets ever competing while having Kyrie. You can't win with that much hostility within the franchise. ""alL hE wAnTEd tO Do Is CeLEbRaTE HiS fAMiLy!""  OK. Then be a fucking adult. Not a single fucking person would have cared in the franchise is Irving said his family needed a couple nights together after 2020. But, being a bitch, leaving his teammates hanging and ghosting the franchise? Nope. That ship has sailed."
Kyrie Irving; the ARG lol beat the game and unlock a superstar for your franchise
"The NBA story of Kyrie Irving can be told in 1 sentence. He made 1 very important shot. Outside of that, he’s just 1 of many people to play in the NBA."
Hitler aka Kyrie Irving
"Kyrie ""Jaden Smith"" Irving."
"Why yes, Kyrie Irving missed multiple games to attend a birthday party. Glad the murder is solved."
Kyrie Irving was likable and humble before he won with the cavs I wonder what happened?
...Support Kyrie Irving in what? What is he doing that you support?
"You must not have been paying very close attention to the NBA in 2018-2019, both K.D and Irving were headed into the off-season as unrestricted free agents so there were constant rumors of them teaming up, potentially with the NY Knicks long before Kyrie and the Celtics got bounced in the playoffs. There were reports that Draymond even called KD out for having one foot out the door already during his final season in Golden State. This was all well documented in real time during that season, there was no hindsight like you claimed."
"I’m surprised some people are mad rather than just sticking with the obvious “yeah I relate.”  It’s honestly good to hear that Dame, even as a millionaire that is still cautiously traveling across the country, is living a life relatively close to a regular person and is taking as much proper precaution.  Definitely better than the Dwayne Haskins (and probably Kyrie Irving) approaches to the pandemic.  Tho Zoom calls with Dame would be a fun idea."
These media clowns are embarrassing. They want to cover drama. Cover the sport. Media clowns just want a reaction for clicks. Embarrassing.  I support Kyrie Irving.
"Love this. I knew the Nets would be a shitshow.   Fuck Kyrie Irving. He reminds me an ex-friend that called everyone puppets and constantly had to gloat about how much more woke he was than everyone else. Shit was obnoxious. Didn't matter the topic, he had to argue to prove how much more he knew than you. If you tried to introduce your own evidence, it became, ""You only believe that 'cause you're getting the wrong information and can't see you're being controlled by the ""elite""."""
"If you listen to the clip, SAS is full on burning Kyrie  ""Considering he's being paid 35 million dollars, who are we to ask that question.... You know what, you're just not significant enough to ask that question. I mean, he's uh, Kyrie Irving. We have to just uh, bow at the alter of Kyrie, and let him come out to play when he wants to play."""
"Kyrie Irving day by day is diminishing the credibility of the mental health community. Get the fuck off the Nets Kyrie, retire, or release a statement on what's going on."
Idk what else anybody expected for Kyrie “my knowledge of covid comes from flat earth accounts and Dr Sebi screen grabs” Irving
So much hate in this sub. Why are so many people concerned about how much money Kyrie Irving loses?   I support Kyrie Irving. He is a human being. Basketball is not the most important thing in the world. I respect the decision Kyrie Irving will make with his career because he’s going to do what he thinks is best for his life.  It put a smile on my face watching Kyrie Irving smiling and dancing with his sister and father in the leaked videos. Human beings deserve to be happy. Stop hating.

"&gt; Okay man. It's easy with hindsight to say the Nets were the obvious choice but if that's so why would he make that promise to Celtics fans when he didn't have to?  As you know, things change fast in the NBA. Kyrie probably genuinely felt that way when he told the crowd that in October and all it takes is one conversation for things to be flipped on their head. And that one conversation appeared to have happen during the 2019 All Star Game.   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/30/kevin-durant-admits-he-kyrie-irving-solidified-they-were-joining-forces-at-all-star-game/   You never rebutted any of my points about why it made logical sense to leave Boston and join the Nets for Kyrie Irving. That's why I am saying your response is emotional base instead of logically based."
"People lose interest in things. That’s life. If you’re not happy doing something in life, then what’s the point of  still doing that thing?  I wouldn’t mind Kyrie Irving retiring. I would respect him more as a person if he does."
This the kyrie irving burner account?
"Check your numbers again. Dame shot 8 threes per game two years ago on 37% shooting. Including the playoffs of only 9 games to illustrate Kyrie's shooting ability is silly unless you want me to bring up Lillard's 16% or 28% 3 point shooting playoffs seasons. It's just a short sample size that doesn't represent their shooting capability. Thus far, you haven't proven that Lillard is a better shooter. They are equal in shooting. It's okay to say two players are equally as good in a certain area. Like I said, Lillard is a better player than Irving because of the intangibles. But from a skill perspective, Kyrie is one of the most skilled players. The issue with Kyrie is his mental state and lack of leadership."
Fuck Kyrie Irving. Good job being the young guys roll model. Dickhead
"Did they even want Kyrie to begin with? I think him and KD were a package deal. If you wanna sign KD, you have to sign irving too."
You’re an idiot if you bet money on Kyrie Irving. You always just wait for him to drop 40 and trade him away in that situation because he’s injury prone.
"I don't know trade rules very well, but is it possible that Houston trade *Wall* for Kyrie at this point? I got the feeling Harden wanted out of Houston after they picked up John Wall. The Nets would surely want JW over the basket case that is Kyrie Irving at this point, and Harden and Kyrie seem to have a lot in common."
"""My dick fell of"" - Kyrie Irving"
"At this point, beating a 73 win team with Kyrie Irving on your roster has to rank #1 as the greatest accomplishment in NBA history."
"https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/ex-cleveland-cavaliers-gm-david-griffin-discusses-what-led-kyrie-irving-to-ask-for-trade-in-2017/95-572911394#:~:text=We%20know%20why%20Irving%20wanted,expand%20his%20game%20somewhere%20else.&amp;text=Kyrie%20didn't%20just%20sign,James%20was%20going%20to%20do."
The 2018 and the 2020 Boston Celtics were better and had more success in the regular season and in the playoffs than the 2019 Boston Celtics with Kyrie Irving.
Kyrie's reasoning for leaving Cleveland was centered on not being in Lebron's shadow and going to a team where he would be the focal point of the offense  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20124505/kyrie-irving-seeking-trade-cleveland-cavaliers
That ‘re-aggravates face injury’ in China was so staged. He deliberately rammed his head into Rondo’s arm. Then grabbed his face and walked off without playing another second in China. This was during all the Morey controversy stuff and he just dipped out.   Classic Kyrie. Video on the ‘injury’ found [in this article. ](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nets-kyrie-irving-leaves-preseason-debut-in-china-two-minutes-into-game-after-taking-shot-to-already-injured-face/amp/)
So your saying a scrub player who goes to every game is more dedicated to basketball than Kyrie Irving?
"I wanna start a reality show where Kyrie Irving, Antonio Brown, and Andre 3000 all share a house together and we just watch them try to function as human beings."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nets-kenny-atkinson-fallout-kevin-durants-concerns-deandre-jordans-starting-spot-among-details-to-emerge/amp/  I thought it was a known fact that Durant wanted Atkinson gone.   My point is that even tho Irving is a better player, he a) has been hurt constantly the few years, b) is a locker room cancer, and c) the nets were a good team with DLo as the leader. They had good chemistry and he had an breakout all star year as a very young player. Adding Durant to what they already had wouldve been great. Why on earth anyone would think switching out DLo for Kyrie was a good move is unthinkable. The only two rational explanations are what I said or the Nets leadership is completely incompetent"
"No, no reports he spoke to Nash. Reports state the opposite.   Yes, Kyrie Irving is a tremendous douchebag. Nothing new or surprising there."
"""If only Durant had been given a clue, maybe some sort of advanced notice that Kyrie Irving might be a problem to deal with as a teammate before signing with Brooklyn,"" said no one ever."
"Kyrie is not a major pop culture star (neither is Harden) and there are literally no fans attending games while ratings are dipping anyways. For the love of god, the NBA has to suspend this guy. This isn’t a megastar like LeBron or Steph that they’d probably wanna protect: Kyrie Irving hasn’t been a star since LeBron won him a ring in 2016."
The stats you shared are even more skewed tho. The first link had kyrie Irving number one because he scored the most even though he shot horrible from the field at 35%. Than trae young 4th in the exact same situation as kyrie. Then just look at the rest of the no names that make up the rest of the top 5. And then the second link you shared has embiid at three games. Not saying he isn’t clutch but those rankings are garbage.
"“I think it’s just kinda funny you know. All this stuff going on in the world and people talking about Kyrie Irving missing games. Like when you compare the atoms that make up this entity known as Kyrie Irving, it’s nothing compared to the universe. And society wants me to go out and play like a jester for their court. Like I’m a pawn for people to control.”  “So are you retiring or...?”  “No I still want that paycheck. I just don’t want to do anything to earn it. It’s your internalized oppression that is making you ask that question.”"
"We are not at the stage where we can allow someone's grandparents to die because James Harden wants to go to a strip club or Kyrie Irving wants to celebrate a birthday for two weeks, so no."
Sort of. I think a lot of us thought that Durant and Irving would have some sort of issue over who got to be team leader. I'm not sure anyone expected Kyrie to run off into the sunset and decide he didn't really want to play basketball anymore.
"Kyrie Irving is a moron. From his “we don’t need a coach,” comment to calling the media “pawns,” to his flat earth bullshit that he never fully owned...I give up on this guy. He needs to grow up and stop sabotaging his team with his words and his actions."
Breaking: Kyrie Irving doing Kyrie Irving things
Welcome to life with Kyrie Irving.
"On one hand, who gets invited to a party with Kyrie Irving and snitches? On the other hand, I've seen Gossip Girl; rich people are always snitching on each other."
I am a KD fan but he’s a dumbass.  He had the best teammate in the world in Steph Curry and he left for Kyrie “I want the last shot” Irving and all his craziness.
Kyrie Irving is an asshole.
Exactly like Kyrie Irving? That dude ain’t no where near Mitch’s level
"Kyrie is a better shooter, but not a better finisher.  FG% in Restricted Area:   Kyrie Irving | James Harden ---|--- 57.7% | 68.3% 65.3% | 64.3% 62.2% | 58.8% 61.6% | 62.4% 57.6% | 65.5% 58.8% | 60.7% 58.2% | 58.2% 56.9% | 61.4% - | 60.5% - | 57.1% ---|--- 59.7875 | 61.72  Harden is consistently better at finishing around the rim, and does it on 1-2 more attempts per game."
"""*But it's only the regular season. Does it really matter to YOU?*"" - Kyrie Irving"
"Alright, that's a good question. And the answer to that is: he is kinda nuts too. Not ""Kyrie Irving"" crazy, but a lot more than the average NBA player."
See.  This is why Ben Simmons got a fine and Kyrie Irving didn't.
"Trying to get into Kyrie's head is like trying to heard cats.  He's a fucking weird guy, his thought process isn't always rational, and he's a diva. &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  Having this debate about the fan is pointless right now.  If it comes out this guy is part of some hate groups or something then sure he was a racist and we should all treat him as such.  It could also come out that he's a decent person whose worst moment is now being played on a loop because he got too drunk and hated Kyrie Irving for reasons that have nothing to do with race.  It could also be any number of other scenarios.  We don't know and we might never know.  &amp;nbsp;  Kyrie bringing it there is very on brand... the problems that seem to follow him wherever he goes are never his fault. If every place you visit smells like shit you need to check your shoes.  Does it being on brand make it any less possible?  Nope.    &amp;nbsp;  TL;DR &amp;nbsp;  Kyrie is a weirdo who seems to thrive on conflict (That he often creates).  The fan might be racist or he might not be... we don't actually know."
Maybe as an organization but Kyrie Irving is definitely not more likable than Jaylen Brown.
"Have you seen Kryie's rap sheet in Boston?  Trust me, that shit would have happened to him almost anywhere after the shit he's said and done.  It's not because he's black, it's because they don't like his ass.  They didn't throw that shit at KD and Harden, who are the 2 best players. They threw it at Former Celtic and public enemy #1 in their eyes.  We have a shit ton of racial issues in this country, shit I still get looks at places because I'm brown so I totally get that aspect and we need to work to get all of that corrected.  But we hurt the cause when shit like this happens because now we're saying there's a race problem when the whole thing was antagonized by Kyrie Irving.  After Kyrie implied that Boston fans were racist, one guy took offense and figured, we don't like you because you said we were racist, we think you're a d-bag traitor, he's a bottle on your way out.  Not agreeing with the action but it's how this event has played out."
Ya they've boo'd him based on all the shit he's pulled. I would boo him. I have no problem saying i don't like kyrie irving. And neither has this subreddit for the past 3-4 years.
"&gt; Kyrie Irving calls tonight's incident ""underlying racism"" and says that fans have been treating players like ""we're in a zoo.""  That sounds like he's talking about tonight's incident specifically, that's why I'm zeroed in on it. If he was being more general, this is an unbelievably misleading headline"
"You said the 2 biggest carry jobs in NBA history. I know you're not talking about any of the Heat rings because he had the Heatles and Erik Spoelstra with him. You can't be talking about the Lakers ring because...well it's obvious right? So I'm not sure how you got 2 of the biggest carry jobs because there's only his 1 Cleveland ring left.  Sure he was the standout MVP in that series against the Warriors, but you're just gonna pretend that Irving and K.Love don't exist? If you think Kyrie and maybe even Love aren't Hall of Famers you're something else."
"Not justifying this action, but it didn’t help that Kyrie stomped on the Celtics team logo mid court before exiting. Crowd is already raucous and hates him, why instigate? Why shake the jar of fire ants? Classless act by Irving followed by a scumbag fan tossing a water bottle. Overall a shit situation."
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31540143/boston-celtics-fan-appears-throw-water-bottle-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving   Do they though??🤔🤔
A disgusting act by Kyrie Irving!
"Because Kyrie Irving is more likely to drop 30 than 16 and Tatum ain't dropping 50 every game lol. But nephews and nieces got the memory of a goldfish, so it is what it is."

"They have 2 players who are top 5 (or top 3) MVP candidates every year: Durant+Harden.  The 3rd option is a 90/50/40 guy, who is arguably a top 10 player too: Kyrie Irving.  4th option is one of the best 3PT shooters and and 3PT Champ: Joe Harris  5th option is injured but a fringe all-star or 6MOY candidate: Dinwiddie  6th option is Blake Griffin who is a former all-star, who is a shell of his former self but still a very quality player.  They also had Aldridge and other talented guys beyond that lol."
"So you just want an apology to Celtics fans? Ok here:  1 apology*  *Redeemable only if a Celtics fan doesn’t throw an object, such as a water bottle, at Kyrie Irving. Let’s hope no one does that!"

Once Wiseman went down the Warriors had no right making the playoffs  Yet here you are bragging about Harden elevating a roster made up of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris and generally a much stronger bench than what the Warriors are supporting Steph with  And some people think I'm too harsh when I say this subreddit has to have the lowest sports IQ of any subreddit on this site.

"he played with bums in the last 5 years. draymond, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, James Harden, Kyrie Irving. Trash teams but he carried them"
"It's weird how betrayed Boston sports fans feel about veteran players who joined the Red Sox mid-career and then left as free agents.  It kinda makes sense if it's a homegrown player that came up with the team.  But pretending that Kyrie Irving or Johnny Damon--guys who were stars before they came to Boston--""betrayed"" Boston because they left is kinda crazy. I get that they said they wouldn't leave when they were still there, but every player says that."
Jayson Tatum and Kyrie Irving are doing okay
"Harden adds to the presence oversea as I think he is popular in china. The nets can have a big presence as their best three players are famous. Anyone who follows the NBA knows who Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden are.  We will see how long they stay with the Brooklyn Nets.   Knicks will always be New York's team as they have been bad for many years and still have a big loyal following that the Nets do not have in New York."
I do not agree with you. The Knicks are much  bigger than the Nets in New York. It is a big gap when it comes to enthusiasm between the two franchise. You can see the fans in Madison square garden and how they reacted to the New York Knicks winning a play off game.  I saw a comment say that Derrick rose is bigger in New York than Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving.  People in New York still care more about the Knicks than the Nets even though the Brooklyn Nets have a much better basketball team.
Yeah go tell people what to do on the internet some more with your kyrie irving flair. Lmaooooooo
"It’s really gonna be an interesting series. The Bucks size is unreal, like who tf is gonna be guarding the trio of Giannis, Middleton and Lopez. The paint is gonna be open season for them.

Kyrie Irving is a weirdo lmao
"Because kyrie is an egotistical mental midget who believes the earth is legitimately flat and that nothing is ever his fault. He relishes the limelight when things are going well and throws everyone and his mother under the bus when he gets hit with a curve ball. He wanted to be ""the man"" in Boston, but didn't want to deal with the responsibilities and pressure that comes with being a teams #1.  He's a punk bitch who instead of acting like a man and facing the consequences of his shithead actions during his brief stint with the Celtics, he instead tried to shield himself from criticism by race baiting all of Boston and ended up shitting the bed, again, going 6-17 and seemingly picking up right where he left off when he tanked the Celtics back in 2019 vs Milwaukee. Fuck Kyrie Irving"

"I guess the direct quote is ambiguous, but seems like he's referring to in the arena:   ""Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard a couple of things,"" Smart said of Boston fans making racist comments, per Yahoo Sports' Keith Smith. ""It's hard to hear that and then have them support us as players. It's kind of sad and sickening.""  [source](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/celtics-marcus-smart-danny-ainge-comments-kyrie-irving/1923x595g2bg312hdgxjgh4rna)"
We traded Baron Davis and the pick that would end up being kyrie irving for mo Williams and Jamario moon.   That’s my least favorite one.
"I mean every chip Lebron won had AD, Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade.  He had two finals runs in the east as a solo star but got **swept** **both times** by real contenders (spurs/warriors) when he faced them.  I don't think any nba player, even lebron, can get it done on a 1 star team."
"Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Jaylen Brown made the All Star game over Trae. Julius is a Forward."
"Kyrie Irving and underdelivering in Boston, name a better duo"
Evan Fournier &gt; Kyrie Irving
"If Bryn Forbes has to guard Kyrie Irving, then Kyrie is going to score 120 points a game"
KYRIE IRVING IS ALIVE LETS GO

"That's the beauty of combining self-interest and social justice. It creates an extra layer against criticism. Is Kyrie Irving's comments rooted in legitimate concern? Yes of course it is. Boston has been known to be a very racist city. But is Kyrie Irving using this situation for personal gain? With the way he brought it up and the context surrounding his situation in Boston, it sure looks that way. I'm not the only one who sees it that way too. That's why Jaylen Brown's comments resonated with me and a lot of people. He articulated with what felt wrong about Kyrie's statement."

&gt;Kyrie Irving used racism as a shield for his actions in Boston.   What
Kyrie Irving used racism as a shield for his actions in Boston. As if he’s saying “any criticism against me from Boston is racist”. It felt strange coming from Kyrie. Someone who is known for lashing out against any criticism from fans and commentators. Me and other people can’t help but feel that this was a preemptive strike to deflect criticism. Kyrie would have gotten booed and heckled even if he was white with the way he left Boston.
This subreddit has a deep hatred for Kyrie Irving. It’s kinda sickening
It's only strange because it's Kyrie Irving in Boston. Kyrie is still living rent free in Boston
People slandering Kyrie Irving is the exact opposite of the most annoying thing in the world.
"First off, never correct how someone speaks when u are unable to even make a google search to get a story correct. ur completely full of shit, blatantly lying hoping to not get called out by someone who actually follows the sport. Marcus Smart was months ago? Dude did you miss the comments he made LAST NIGHT?  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments)  ""ahead of game three against the nets""  See there ya go ur blatantly lying out of ur ass.  Lmfao, dude ur blinded by ur own ignorance. Nobody is saying Boston is the only city who still has racist fans? I showcased in my original comment how Utah is even more of a prevalent spot for these issues, but you just chose to get ur panties in a bunch over the mention that casual racism in Boston tends to be more prevalent than other cities?  Why must you use deflection based-defence when addressing a real issue in the city that so clearly lays near to your heart? Do you not see Jazz fans criticizing their own fans for their actions? That is ALL THIS IS. Nobody is saying everyone from Boston is racist, nobody is saying Boston has no good fans, this topic just clearly hit so close to home you personally chose to interpret it that way. Sorry it hurts you so deeply when others criticize your fellow racist fans. Next time actually criticize your fellow fans like you claim to, instead of directing your anger towards those who call it out as prevalent in boston. (fact.)"
Plus he clamped Kyrie hard in the regular season.  Jrue has the best chance of mitigating Harden but I'm not sure he can disrupt him as much as he did Irving
With most human beings I'd roll with your guess but this is Kyrie Irving. You sure about that?
Kyrie Irving is not a superstar.
Brooklyn D&amp;D party  &gt; Do you want the tiny quicksilver thief (Kyrie Irving) or the burly crafty woodsman (James Harden) or the tall ethereal phantom (Kevin Durant)?
Spike buying his Kyrie Irving jersey as we speak
Yeah Kyrie Irving not the Queen of England
Dude the offseason trade rumors (Ben Simmons) and vaccine mandate Basketball Z bouta be hilarious. Maybe get some kyrie irving instagram live voiceovers lol
"**Should be locks:**   Paul George  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Trae Young  Karl-Anthony Towns  **I Would Take:**  Chris Paul   Rudy Gobert  Bradley Beal   &amp;#x200B;  Zion, Mitchell, Booker, Lavine all have strong arguments over those 3 at the end. I think Middleton, Bam, and Westbrook are comfortably the bottom 3 for me. They are great players, but I wouldn't actually want any of those guys as my best player if I'm trying to make the playoffs - and with Bam and Westbrook they have definite flaws that can be exploited."
"&gt;The city of San Francisco's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for large indoor events — which will force Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins to miss home games at Chase Center unless he gets vaccinated — does not apply to unvaccinated players on visiting teams.  &gt;Some have found it strange that the city's mandate applies only to Warriors players and not opposing players who are reportedly unvaccinated, such as the Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving or the Washington Wizards' Bradley Beal. Attempts to explain the discrepancy have largely painted the question as a legal and jurisdictional issue and not a policy choice on behalf of the city. (""Because [visiting players] are not employees of a company that is under the city’s limits, the rules don’t currently apply"" reads a paragraph from a recent piece in The Athletic.)  &gt;However, the city's health department currently requires bars, gyms and restaurants to screen customers for proof of vaccination, regardless of whether that customer lives in the city or not. The health department is also using its authority to mandate masks, physical distancing and testing for out-of-town unvaccinated players, which strongly suggests it has the ability to bar unvaccinated opposing players from Chase Center if it so desires."
"Legit though, if my star was saying stupid shit like this and if he sits out games this year, no way I’m giving him the 5 year super max. Someone will always take a chance and max out a space cadet (see Irving, Kyrie) but who knows what else is around the corner.   If he’s missing games and still doing this, maybe trading him becomes a good idea again."
"Well, I said my reasons in the comment, both of which I believe are fully valid. Winning basketball isn’t just put up with anything from anyone as long as they’re good at basketball. Kyrie Irving clearly comes with a whole lot of distractions which I don’t believe are worth the hassle."
"*If you're very much woke, there is no such thing as distractions.* -Kyrie Irving, Sep 18th 2017; [link to quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/70vqxp/king_kyrie_irving_on_first_take_when_asked_about/)  Sounds like someone is no longer very much woke..."
Kyrie Irving is the Kanye West of the NBA. So talented but so mentally unstable and easily mislead
"Kyrie Irving is screaming from his IG Live and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Irving comes out say ""y'all on that bullshit!"" League is imploding. Irving is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room."
“ i dont WANT to be a distraction. I NEED to be.”   - kyrie irving   - michael scott
"do you think kyrie is the only athlete that follows farrakhan? is AI malicious? is KD? Was desean jackson being malicious when he shared a quote by farrakahn where he was praising hitler?   kyrie irving, like most professional athletes, is not educated and likely surrounded by yes men. there’s no reason to suspect anyone has even tried to check him in his connection to farrakhan, because most of his circle also fucks with farrakhan. they live in a bubble.   theyre ignorant. don’t get the two twisted.   kyrie does tons of charity work as well. there’s little evidence to him being a bad person, but tons of evidence that shows he’s a fucking moron."
"What a weird babying of kyrie irving... you don't think people haven't told kyrie about the anti semitic takes that farrakhan has? Like we can all see that farrakhan has anti semitic takes but kyrie is just some poor sap who ""succumb to charismatic individuals"". choosing to ignore those things and continuing to support someone like farrakhan, especially when you're kyrie irving, with the platform that kyrie irving has, is malicious as fuck."
As someone in San diego im great full my city won't be subjected to the ignorant presence of kyrie irving
Next week:  *Kyrie Irving v. the State of New York*
Kyrie Irving is like Vincent Van Gough. A little insane but is a genius in his own right. We will appreciate him when he retires.
I call dibs on the KYRIE IRVING HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION self-post if we get Lakers/Clippers-Nets.
"Injured, or throwing birthday parties in a pandemic, or you know. [Just chillin.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/nets/2021/01/10/kyrie-irving-out-personal-reasons-misses-third-consecutive-game/6617417002/)"
Kyrie Irving is the Muhammad Ali of morons.
[Off]season finale episode simply HAS to be the Ben Simmons for Kyrie Irving trade.   This stuff writes itself. Give the people what they want!!!!!
"Brilliant,  4d chess by Kyrie Irving.  Man's finally found him a way to not have to do interviews.  He's probably not even anti-vax, he just worked out no one will interview you if you aren't vaccinated."
We’re also told Kyrie Irving will play the Finals on Zoom later.
"Don't forget Kyrie ""what does vaccine mean to you"" Irving"
Kyrie Irving will address the media today after it was reported that he is likely one of the unvaccinated players on the Brooklyn Nets.   Any bets on what his statement to the media on this issue will look like?
I'll never forget Celtics fans responded to Kyrie Irving suggesting they shouldn't say offensive things to players...by saying offensive things to Kyrie Irving.  But they still wanna get mad that them being racist is their reputation lol
Kyrie Irving
"Then who was playing the 3 in Cleveland when Lebron, Smith, and Irving were all on the floor?   Kyrie?   It's all arbitrary."
These dumb fucks need to go start their own fucking planet and get the fuck off mine already.  We've put up with this goddamn bullshit for fucking long enough.   Just kick them out of the fucking league and let them complain on some bullshit conspiracy website.   Why are we still having these discussions? Why are we still giving any sort of attention or credibility to anything they've said?   Kyrie Irving can seriously go fuck himself.
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
You guys think my list is valid? 1) serge ibaka  2) kelly oubre  3) paul george  4) jayson tatum  5) gordon hayward  6) Sga  7) Kawhi leonard  8) zach lavine  9) dillon “chad” brooks  10) kyrie irving
"Maybe I'm a boomer but I think Kyrie Irving should be above Trae.   Also it's weird because Kyrie is a point and Harden is a shooting guard, but on the Nets they play reversed.  I also take John Collins over Julius Randle, but again maybe I'm just stupid."
Curry was playing a Lebron lead team with Kyrie Irving going ballistic.  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis played against a Suns team whose only line of defense for him was a dude who had never been in the playoffs before and had no backup because he blew his knee up.
&gt;Kyrie Irving recently started following and liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan.”    Lmao what?! This guys so far gone
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."
"Depends on what you value more between floor raising and ceiling raising. Not many point guards I'd rather have isolate for a game winner, or play as on off guard with a great forward. But, there's also guys I'd rather have run 20 pick and rolls with every night.   Honestly Kyrie has always been a confounding player. Back when he vs John Wall was a big debate circa 2014 a lot of people argued Wall was the better 'point guard' got his teammates better etc, but the Cavs pre-Bron would have better half court offenses off the back of Irving just being an offensive dynamo. Sometimes we gotta remember a player's individual stats don't matter as much as their team's stats when they're on the court. (ex Harden turnovers, his are often high but the Rockets as a team, were low)  Guys effect the game in different ways, I really think supporting cast plays a big role in whether I'd want Iriving or the 5 point guards you might have ahead of him."
"Players can care about winning and not want to change their playstyle. Simmons isn't a player I'm a huge fan of but in the absence of Draymond Green or say Kyrie Irving, I'd say he's the perfect 3rd max guy on a GSW or Nets championship team. His shooting hurts the Sixers way too much because of fit. But at this point, acting like it's his responsibility to become the player the Sixers needs despite already being a top 30 player in the league is like asking Gobert to become an elite passer for Utah's sake."
"What’s there to even respond to? Everyone who actually watches basketball sees Harden is playing point. Steve Nash said Harden is playing point, Kyrie irving said Harden is playing point. Why should I even debate this nonsense?"
"Kyrie “Alex Jones” Irving for Ben “Young Socialite” Simmons, who says no?"
Pretty dangerous that Kyrie Irving has influence over millions of NBA fans with that line of thinking. Impressionable children see this bullshit
"Even then I don't think you could argue it's harmless to say shit like that when you think about the influence a star NBA player like Kyrie Irving has in society.  Public figures like Kyrie are not only seen as role models to kids, but they give platforms to people who believe the same shit.  So you know as stupid as the stuff he's said, he's indirectly empowered and encouraged other stupid people that their views are valid/normalized and that it's okay to spread misinformation if an NBA star is agreeing with it.  Your words reach a lot of people when you have the money and power that someone like Kyrie Irving has."
You would have to be delusional to think that Kyrie Irving doesn’t have any fans left.
"&gt; **Irving**, who serves as a vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union, recently **started** following and **liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines** in a plot **to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan**.”  Human beings are complex and multi-faceted, but... Kyrie, *seriously*?"
"[According to Rolling Stone](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/nba-anti-vaccine-theory-issues-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-kyrie-irving-jonathan-isaac-025316932.html), Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving — who has a past filled with conspiracy theories — has reportedly been liking social media posts regarding “secret societies” that are “implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for ‘a plan of Satan.’"
So you'll be on the 'Kyrie Irving is a menace to society and should be shipped off to crazy island with his crazy aunt'.
Wow I hate Kyrie Irving now
"&gt;“Pretty much everyone had a mask on,” says the mother of one student in attendance. “Everyone but Kyrie, everywhere he went.” &gt; &gt; &gt;The superintendent insists that Irving and students had remained as socially-distanced as possible during his visit, but on the school’s Facebook page, only fake news remained: **An administrator had Photoshopped crude painstrokes over his nose and mouth,** along with doctored masks on several bare-chinned students, because Irving had broken public-health protocol on government grounds.  I’m gonna need to see that photo ASAP"

"When people rightfully gave shit to Kyrie about things like him stating the world is flat, there were also those who defended him, saying that it's not a big deal. *Who cares*? *It's a harmless belief.* Sure, you could could argue the belief is harmless. But you know what isn't harmless? The complete lack of critical thinking that leads to that kind of conclusion. This is exactly the kind of situation that comes about when falsities are accepted as reality. People have died and will die because of the opinions and views of people like Kyrie Irving."
"Kyrie ""Christopher Columbus"" Irving"
"This article affirmed my previous suspicion, I’d rather hang out with Enes Kanter than Kyrie Irving."
It is the least surprising thing ever that Kyrie Irving would be central to this.
"nah cuz a lot of these people dying are older with kids already. which makes this even more depressing because how many innocent people have had their worlds shattered because facebook groups and dumbass celebrities with influence like Kyrie Irving brainwashed their loved ones? these idiots dont understand the power of their platform, kyrie isnt just stupid, hes dangerously stupid"
"&gt;The superintendent insists that Irving and students had remained as socially-distanced as possible during his visit, but on the school’s Facebook page, only fake news remained: An administrator had Photoshopped crude painstrokes over his nose and mouth, along with doctored masks on several bare-chinned students, because Irving had broken public-health protocol on government grounds.  &gt;“People seeing Kyrie on the rez,” the mother recalls, “even though we’re in a pandemic, I don’t think they stopped to be like, ‘Are you vaccinated?’ **No, they’re like, ‘Damn, this is Kyrie!’ He’s one of our heroes.”**  The saddest part is that some people clearly live in a different world than others. Some of them happen to be mega influencers that promote the zaniest of ideas, such as COVID anti-vax rhetoric. The sad thing is children look up to these people  I really hate celebrity worshiping because it leads to such idiocy, meanwhile true heroes go unnoticed."
"My thought provoking analysis is that Kyrie Irving is approximately 40x times better at basketball than Ben Simmons and will be until the end of time. So as a sixers fan yes, every day, twice on sundays, I swap Ben Simmons for Kyrie."
"Lol if you watched the video, he was clearly holding back laughter. Look up “Jaylen flat earth” and you’ll see articles talking about how he was joking and linking to his tweets which make it even clearer   https://nesn.com/2017/09/has-kyrie-irving-convinced-jaylen-brown-to-become-flat-earth-truther/"
"&gt;Kyrie is not a head case,   Copied from a comment above...  &gt;Irving, who serves as a vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union, recently started following and liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan.” This Moderna microchip misinformation campaign has spread across multiple NBA locker rooms and group chats, according to several of the dozen-plus current players, Hall-of-Famers, league executives, arena workers and virologists interviewed for this story over the past week.   What were you saying again...?"
Kyrie Irving is a moron.
Kyrie Irving went to Duke lmao
"Or, in the case of Kyrie, they believe weird conspiracy theories:   &gt; Irving, who serves as a vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union, recently started following and liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan.” This Moderna microchip misinformation campaign has spread across multiple NBA locker rooms and group chats, according to several of the dozen-plus current players, Hall-of-Famers, league executives, arena workers and virologists interviewed for this story over the past week."
"&gt; “There are so many other players outside of him who are opting out, I would like to think they would make a way,” says Kyrie’s aunt, Tyki Irving, who runs the seven-time All-Star’s family foundation and is one of the few people in his regular circle of advisors. “It could be like every third game. So it still gives you a full season of being interactive and being on the court, but with the limitations that they’re, of course, oppressing upon you. There can be some sort of formula where the NBA and the players can come to some sort of agreement.”  So Kyrie is not vaccinated. Not sure how one can declare themselves an advocate for the black community then not take steps to prevent a disease that disproportionately affects Black Americans. Remember when he told the Nets he was having family issues then went partying without a mask at an indoor venue for his sister's birthday? If you scroll down the article, she says even more. Please stop falling for his antics and BS.  &gt; Jonathan Isaac is known less by the average basketball fan for his play than for being that guy who stood up with his jersey on during the national anthem in the NBA bubble, while every other player on the court took a knee in a t-shirt declaring BLACK LIVES MATTER, amid a global reckoning on race and police killings. “I’m not going to sit here and point my fingers at one group of people,” Isaac, who is Black, tells RS. “I would do it again.”  &gt; The Orlando Magic’s 23-year-old starting forward is deeply religious — and proudly unvaccinated. When NBA players started lining up for shots in March, Isaac started studying Black history and watching Donald Trump’s press conferences. He learned about antibody resistance and came to distrust Dr. Anthony Fauci. He looked out for people who might die from the vaccine, and he put faith in God.  Mo Bamba, his teammate, could have easily had his career derailed by post-COVID illness and be stuck on the edge of the league if not for the Magic's tanking status. How selfish. Jonathan must have skimmed the Gospel."
kyrie Irving comes off in this story how you would expect.
"Jesus Christ, not Jonathan Isaac too. I love that guy, or at least I did.      And wtf Kyrie:      &gt; Irving, who serves as a vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union, recently started following and liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan.”"
"Kyrie Irving converting to Islam, pelicans GM playing piano for Zion, and now this. Offseason is a fucking comedy."
Leave it to Kyrie Irving to figure out a way to sit out even more games and still get his full salary. He's a joke / troll player. The Nets will never win with him.
"I know it would never happen in reality. But on paper, does a Ben Simmons for Kyrie Irving trade improve both teams?"
He’ll pull the Kyrie Irving
I had an Illuminati eye tattooed inside part of another tattoo that had a triangle shaped gap as a kind of joke. Some dude was like “is that a Kyrie Irving tattoo?” I think I may need to cover it up.
Kyrie Irving is a horse’s ass
Kyrie Irving is a bad person.  https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/kyrie-irving-reportedly-refused-sign-balls-charitable-purposes  Fuck this piece of trash
He did say it but started following people on social media who believe it:  https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/sports/2021/9/27/22696371/nba-covid-vaccine-kyrie-irving
It literally doesn’t matter. They do not need Kyrie Irving. He’s a luxury piece on this team.   Durant and Harden can do everything he does better than he can.   They could trade him for any viable defensive center and improve.
"Welcome to the Kyrie Irving experience, Nets fans  Sincerely, Cavs and Celtics fans"
"No you’re right, the interstate commerce clause of the US Constitution definitely forbids states and local municipalities from preventing Kyrie Irving from playing basketball inside their arenas. Don’t ask me any more questions about this, though, as it’s HIPAA"
This dude is a fucking clown and toxic to any team that he’s on. Cut him and let his bitch ass retire for his dumb bullshit beliefs. So tired of idiots like this dude giving voice to dangerous conspiracies that have contributed to hundreds of thousands dying nationwide and millions worldwide. Fuck Kyrie Irving with a passion
"Kyrie Irving has been and always will be a fucking clown he's just an arrogant idiot who thinks he knows everything, the one thing he doesn't know is that the Earth is round because this clown is actually a flat earther I mean are you kidding me and to see him having money taken from him for not playing is such a beautiful sight for me to see and that's because I do not like this guy. There's always something going on with this guy and any team that he's played for and I just personally feel he is just so mother freaking ungrateful for everything he's got and what basketball has given him that's one of the main reasons I can't stand this guy. I won't say good luck to Brooklyn because I'm a Heat fan but I do feel for the Brooklyn fans because they're paying the money to see this guy play and they won't get to but Brooklyn good luck with this clown."
"Im all for player empowerment and Kyrie Irving. Even his desire to just leave in the middle of the season. If that’s what he needs, then fine. Everyone’s different.  But this screams “I don’t care about anyone but myself.”"
Metallica's Enter Sandman starts playing as Kyrie walks in with a doctor holding the Johnson and Johnson vaccine......They get to middle court as Kyrie throws off his robe.....Kneels like Tebow with his should facing the doctor.....The crowd goes wild as Doctor J injects Kyrie Irving who then leads them to the championship 45 years after The Doctor did himself.
"I’m curious; the Rockets don’t want Wall but don’t want to buy him out, why not trade him for Irving?  Kyrie retires immediately and goes on Joe Rogan or whatever, the Rockets save a bunch of money, the Nets get Wall, who only needs to be a bit better than half a Kyrie to be an upgrade."
Imagine signing the fucking idiot that is Kyrie Irving and expecting it to go smoothly. I'd rather have an undrafted G leaguer.
"If the Nets somehow don’t with a tittle with this core, Jersey will undoubtedly disown Kyrie Irving"
"This is a lie. The talk was about how great our defense looked in comparison to our regular season effort, and how terrible Bud is as a coach(Giannis minutes etc) and how terrible the bucks were playing, but this was said in the bubble as well, and the year prior when y’all allowed the raptors to steamroll you with 4 wins straight  That did not start with the Nets. Bud and the bucks playing style has been a subject of criticism so stop the cap.   And really, you didn’t prove anything that series outside of beating an injured team **just *barely*** you didn’t overcome anything. You caught a stroke of luck. I’m not knocking the bucks for it. A lot of teams gets lucky and at the end of the day, we know injuries was always a concern  But please stop acting like the Bucks overcame some major obstacle. It took Kyrie being out and Harden being out/rushing back for the Bucks to just barely squeak by in 7 games.   Nets absolutely are significantly better than the Bucks a and you’re an idiot if you disagree. The Bucks escaped that series by the skin of their behinds even with the comical injury luck Brooklyn suffered. They had 3 games of Kyrie Irving and two games of James Harden at like 25% capacity. Give me a break.  And don’t give me that “but muh injury prone players” nonsense. James Harden was an ironman until this recent hamstring and Kyrie Irving’s injury was a freak accident that could’ve happened to anybody.   If Steph Curry and Draymond Green went down in 2018 and Golden State lost to Cleveland, it would be totally reasonable to proclaim the the Warriors would/be champs if healthy . The fact that you’re too fragile to admit it because that would’ve meant another playoff disappointment for your team is irrelevant so again stop the cap and throwing around “bandwagon” I could link you to my Twitter and all my Nets gear collected over the years.   KD played 53 minutes that game 7 and harden was on a injured hamstring and y’all only won by 4 points lol."
You realize this is Kyrie Irving we're talking about right?
Yes but who the fuck is trading for Kyrie Irving
Kyrie Irving is the best chance the Lakers have at beating the Nets. Missing half of the regular season games does wonders to their chemistry
"Dude did a triple-double without points and missed 5x5 by a point. Versatile on both ends. Also was the top scorer in a FINALS GAME 7 that featured LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving. That's nuts."
"Suspend Ben Simmons from the league for 5 years and nullify his contract.  Make vaccination mandatory, remove Kyrie Irving from the NBPA.   Fine Rich Paul the maximum amount allowed several times for each player he's broken the rules with(AD, Simmons etc.)  Get rid of the play in tournament.(fuck your revenue slave overlords)"
"As commissioner, I will...  Take a bribe from Steph Curry to add a 4 point line.  Take a bribe from PETA and make the ball 100% rubber and remove the leather.  Take a bribe from democratic national. Committee to enact a diversity statute that requires every team to have at least 1 player from every continent besides Antarctica, 1 player from every race, and 1 player who is gay, 1 player who is transgender, 1 female player, 1 bi player, and 1 player who identifies as something besides male or female.   Take a bribe from the Republican National Commitee to enact a new diversity statute that requires every team to have at least 2 Republicans, 1 anti-vaxxer, and 1 person who refuses to be alone in the same room as someone of the opposite sex.  Gay anti vaxxer republicans are now highly sought after in today's NBA, kyrie Irving comes out of the closet and immediately renews on a super max contract. Ben Simmons immediately switches political party registration, decides 'I'm a Young socialite and cucked some guys so now I am bi, and Morey suddenly gets the 3 firsts, and 3 swaps he wants in trade for Simmons.   Take a bribe from the Harlem Globetrotters to award them an NBA franchise.   Just to even it out, award a franchise agreement to the Washington Generals so that OKC and the Pistons no longer have to fight for last place in the league."
"There was a good twitter thread breaking this down but can't find it. Here's what I remember.  The Cavaliers were going to trade Kyrie. They were looking into Eric Bledsoe (haha) and so Kyrie was offended and he asked out before they could move him. He said he'd go to the [Timberwolves, Spurs, Heat, Knicks](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/21/16012292/kyrie-irving-trade-demand-cavaliers-spurs-heat-knicks-timberwolves-lebron-james) and they instead sent him to the Celtics.  So it wasn't really like he left Cavs in a one-sided manner to go on to do something better. He was kind of traded around and then eventually left to go to his hometown team and his father's favorite team."
"I got laughed at in another thread for saying that Rudy Gobert is a better player than Kyrie Irving. He probably isn’t, but I don’t think it as laughable as people made it seem. I think Gobert is the most impactful defensive player in the league and does more things on offense than people give him credit for. I also just dislike Kyrie so maybe it is that"

They traded him to LEBRON JAMES. For Kyrie Irving in return. They didn't ship him off to some team who's lucky to lose in the first round like the Mavs for the past decade. Where's the ire towards the Cavaliers for playing him before he had fully healed? Explain to me why are the Celtics are obligated to have charity roster spots? If they had given IT a 10 day contract and then not signed him afterwards his chances on making it on any team would even less than they are now. It would've hurt his ability to play in the league to give him a chance out of the goodness of our hearts.

"Currently, it’s Zach LaVine and Kyrie Irving. Obviously Kyrie has had a much better career. But if we’re basing it off their 2020-21 seasons, I think they’re remarkably close. LaVine, Booker, Mitchell, and Kyrie are all deserving of being considered the best SGs in the league IMO.  All-time, I would have to pick Timmy and Kobe. I’ve seen quite a few people on here put Duncan like 10 spots ahead of Kobe in their all-time rankings. I’ve also seen some people take Kobe over Duncan “easily,” whatever that means. I think it’s hilarious to have one ranked much higher than the other given they basically held hands and dominated an entire decade together, albeit in different ways. They are, personally, interchangeable at my 7th and 8th greatest-of-all-time spots.  Oh, also: Back in the day, me and my friends used to have arguments about Tim Hardaway and Kevin Johnson. They all loved Hardaway and thought he was miles ahead of KJ, and I would argue with them for hours. I personally preferred KJ, but not by a lot."

Since the user didnt like that term, I was trying to figure out what series of letters they would use to describe the concept, instead of 'disinformation'.   If you wanted to make the case that he's maliciously lying - you're never gonna find a piece of paper that says, ""I'm kyrie Irving and I'm going to intentionally and maliciously lie to my fans about covid in order to stir up drama and make more money.""

"&gt;	There’s an irrefutable fact there’s 55 states within the Union of the United States of America, based on the simple definition of state  Prefacing a statement that is 100% wrong with the phrase “there’s an irrefutable fact” doesn’t magically make it true. It just makes you Kyrie Irving Lite.   Out of curiosity: you ignore the actual definition and instead believe that literally anything that was independent in some geographic area at some point is a “US state”. I’ve accepted that by now. However…why are you excluding the hundreds of independent indigenous nations/tribes that predated the United States? Any reason they don’t fit into your theory?  Finally, you should read the things you frantically Google before you copy/paste them. The quote you posted literally draws an explicit line between ‘states’ and ‘territories’."

"Just wait for the next pandemic, one that is much deadlier. That'll straighten this shit out real quick.   What we are seeing is the result of first world privelege. These people have been fortunate to not live a disease ravaged life and don't know the horrors of life before modern medicine (aka 1950). They're so fucking ignorant to not understand anything close to the science and history of the situation.   Back with polio, there was a more significant appreciate of science. Thousands were debilitated with this crippling disease and people wanted a cure. They wanted treatment. They saw the perils this was having. It was also recent enough to experiences they heard about with spanish flu and other flu outbreaks. And it was at the time where antibiotics were new but promising treatments and cures that were flat out groundbreaking. People had suffered and collectively remembered that to appreciate the progress science was making.   Now these dumb fucking assholes of today are so removed and so antagonistic towards education that they know nothing. They should learn about all this in school but ""they don't need to know it"" so they don't bother. And then you got complete fucking dumbasses like kyrie irving doing massive levels of harm with his bulshit. Fuck him and everyone like him. Send them to space and force them to solve real problems or get fucked."
Kylie Irving for sure.  Nobody is going to die if Ben Simmons sits out and not get paid for the whole year.  But when media give Kyrie the spot light it fuels the anti-vaccine movement.

The rumor mill was saying that the Rockets actually didn’t want to trade with the Nets because they didn’t want Kyrie Irving   Imagine having a Harden / Embiid pick and roll surrounded by all their 3 point shooters."
"Have not been able to find an official announcement from either the NBA or NBPA that they agreed on it.

Without any official announcement, it's reasonable to assume that there isn't an official iron clad agreement."

"Kyrie Irving is definitely not an introvert. He craves attention. He left the Cavs because he wanted to be the man on a contender. He landed in Boston, though he did not expect them to be so good without him. He then learned that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't garner the attention that comes with being the man. So, right then he turned into the modern Kyrie we have today to compensate for that lack of attention. People don't realize that he even joined the Nets when the Nets were not contending to be the man. Suddenly, KD shows interest. Now, and needless to say, he is not the man in Brooklyn either. It would seem that his current situation puts him in his element; he is not as passionate about basketball as he is desperate for attention. He is now a part-time NBA player and a full-time attention grabber."

"Exactly. We've got Biden, you've got Kyrie Irving. We have Fauci, you have Nicki Minaj. You're almost getting it."
"In a world where Kyrie suits up for the Sixers the trade would be an absolute win for them. Irving represents the best outcome talent wise that they could receive for Simmons. It would be a rare win-win trade as it would benefit the Nets too in that a full season of Simmons is greater value than half a season of Irving. But of course it all depends on Kyrie’s willingness to play elsewhere.  A straight up trade of Simmons for Irving in a normal world, where there isn’t a pandemic and no player is going to miss half the seasons games for whatever reason, would be a loss for the Nets. Kyrie is simply the better player."

Good God you guys are obsessed with Kyrie Irving.
"I think what he’s doing is very noble and he’s being berated for making a great sacrifice to be a figurehead and lightning rod for people who don’t have the same protections as he does. People should not lose their jobs and livelihoods depending on if they have the vaccine or not. People losing their jobs because of mandates (even though I disagree with their stance on vaccination) is a very, very sad story and a noble cause that Irving is behind. I understand that’s unpopular to say here because people like villainizing others but I just can’t get behind it in this situation. I can’t get myself to hate Kyrie Irving."
"Kyrie ""CM Punk"" Irving"
"&gt;I saw him wearing a mask everywhere  [This was from a Rolling Stone article about unvaccinated NBA players just a few weeks ago:](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/nba-anti-vaxxers-covid-1231988/)  &gt;Before he returned to his day job for the 2021-2022 season, Irving made a trip last month to South Dakota. His mother was born in Standing Rock, and he’d just finished enrolling for his tribal ID when he pulled up to a schoolyard at another Sioux reservation, unannounced, for signatures and selfies — the kind that force a fan to lean in tight and pull down her mandated facemask.   &gt;Inside the school, Irving met with two high-schoolers in a conference room for close talk about Covid and kicks, while twisting a cloth mask in his hands. He took photos in a basketball gym, where all student-athletes over 12 had been required to get vaccinated for the coronavirus to play sports, and where, on this Wednesday afternoon in late August, Irving was playing by his own rules.  &gt;“Pretty much everyone had a mask on,” says the mother of one student in attendance. “Everyone but Kyrie, everywhere he went.”  &gt;The superintendent insists that Irving and students had remained as socially-distanced as possible during his visit, but on the school’s Facebook page, only fake news remained: An administrator had Photoshopped crude painstrokes over his nose and mouth, along with doctored masks on several bare-chinned students, because Irving had broken public-health protocol on government grounds.  &gt;“People seeing Kyrie on the rez,” the mother recalls, “even though we’re in a pandemic, I don’t think they stopped to be like, ‘Are you vaccinated?’ No, they’re like, ‘Damn, this is Kyrie!’ He’s one of our heroes.”"

Worth mentioning the owners will obliterate the players in the next CBA is Kyrie Irving sits out two seasons while collecting paychecks
"simmons for irving definitely wouldn't make the nets way worse, it's probably more of an even trade for them simply because of harden/kd being so unstoppable on offense. ben can just redefine his offensive game, have a much lighter load, and just focus on defense.  kyrie \*if he's trying\* makes the sixers way better than with ben because he can actually shoot and play a proper PG for them. which, if i'm the nets, i'm not sure i'd want to do... just makes the sixers way better. but also, kyrie isn't going to actually play for whatever team he gets traded for. idk how you're any franchise in the nba and you're looking at all this vaccine drama + his past few years of playing as little basketball as possible and think to yourself that you want him on your team"

The second he's no longer ""amazing basketball player and part of the prohibitive championship trio Brooklyn Nets"" and just regular old ex-nba player saying stupid shit Kyrie Irving, reporters will no longer be hanging on his every word.  The Nets won't be asked about him at every press conference.  That said... I'd pay good money to see the text threat between KD and LeBron.  KD and LeBron, probably:   &gt; KD: My god dude.

Kyrie for Simmons?  I am not aware if there's any vaccine mandate exist for Pennsylvania. Kyrie would be great (basketball-wise) for 76ers and Embiid for both playoffs and season. 76ers don't have any better option.  Simmons would work for Nets. They can simply play him 4 or 5 position. Just make him the only non-shooter in the roster. After that he can be roll man or ball handler easily. Him playing with Durant-Harden would take all the pressure of his shoulders. Great defender so he'd give an edge to Nets team.  Durant-Harden and Pat Mills at bench should be enough for creating for Nets. Adding Simmons for defense would improve that team more than marginal offense coming from Kyrie. Irving is much more injury prone anyway.

Kyrie Irving might not even play this year. To count the heat out before the season starts is monumentally short sighted…"
"Kyrie Irving hasn't been vaccinated. The city of New York has a vaccine mandate, so until he gets vaccinated, he's not allowed to play home games in Brooklyn. There was a lot of controversy about whether he would become a ""part-time"" player and join the team on away games while sitting out home games. The Nets decided that either he gets vaccinated so he can play in all the games or he doesn't get to play in any of the games.  Kyrie Irving has been a controversial figure for awhile. He didn't like playing with LeBron when they were going to the Finals every year, so he requested a trade and went to Boston. [He has publicly declared in the past that he thinks the earth is flat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/07/28/kyrie-irvings-flat-earth-beliefs-now-the-bane-of-middle-school-teachers/). He had a falling out with Boston, and signed with the Nets. Last season, he [took a sabbatical in the middle of the season](/r/nba/comments/q6oyae/puccio_sources_explained_last_year_that_nets/) for ""personal reasons"", but was also seen [partying with Drake](https://www.sohh.com/nba-star-kyrie-irving-sparks-controversy-partying-w-drake-while-on-sabbatical/) during that time (in the heart of the pandemic). He hasn't made any official statements AFAIK about being anti-vaxx, but he has liked [anti-vaxx conspiracy theories](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/09/26/nets-kyrie-irving-reportedly-liking-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-online/) on social media.   He has a reputation among many (me included) for being a faux intellectual and a contrarian just to be a contrarian. There are lots of memes mocking him that use words/phrases like ""being woke"", ""opening your third eye"", and [""what does x mean to you?""](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/doug-gottliebs-wild-story-about-kyrie-irving-brad-stevens-interaction)."
"As this drags on, he's only making things worse! Its worse for the team and worse for him.   I wish I have a salary of around $200 Million if I have those skills as a basketball player like Kyrie Irving. Anybody here will say the same thing."
At least they can build chemistry not having to worry about the yearly Kyrie Irving injury just when he is needed.
"No, in basketball terms i don't understand. Stop acting like you know what other NBA players think just because they don't speak what they think like Kyrie does, LeBron James co-signed a comment by Draymond that was perceived as anti-vax, does that make him less as a basketball player? You can rest assured Kyrie isn't the only one that thinks these things about the vaccine in the NBA.  &gt;  ""greatest ballhandler in NBA history""   He quite literally is that, the same way Steph Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history, it's one of the things he is known for.  I never said that Kyrie's views on the vaccine and his opinions in general aren't dumb or that they aren't dangerous, i simply said that it is incredibly dumb to actually be relieved that Kyrie Irving will stop playing professional basketball in his prime, regardless of his views, he still is ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS TO EVER PLAY THE GAME and him retiring is a gigantic basketball loss, he would be literally wasting his talent for no reason.  &gt; He is evil for that.  Yeah, i'm sure Kyrie is in his lair with a black cape laughing histerically about him not taking the vaccine. Grow the fuck up, dude ain't evil, he's an idiot. Separate the athlete from the person, Kyrie the person might be an idiot, Kyrie the basketball player will be missed if he's gone."
