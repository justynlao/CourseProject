"Who would win:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  vs.   Dame, GTJ, Hood(?), Covington, Kanter  With how CJ was playing, I honestly think that top team would win. Lol."
"Blazers hospital team:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  Luckily Roco is back from his concussion!"
"it's fair, and I completely agree with you on a defensive difference maker.  RoCo &amp; Derrick Jones haven't quite been it, and for Jones it's been tough because as you say teams are more than content to leave him wide open all night, that will only get worse in the playoffs.  I don't think there's a single move that puts them over the top, nobody that's available moves the needle enough for them (knowing they could've drafted Bam instead of Zach Collins is painful, he's the exact type of big they need) to really cover up for their problems on defense.  My thinking is that Vooch is neutral to Nurk and his extra offense would be a boost, if they can get him at an affordable price it's another step in the right direction."
"No, but unless your name is Zach Collins they never call it."
"Zach ""fuck u hoe"" Collins"
I’m pretty sure Zach Collins is just a myth at this point
"The area where we draft well is hitting on second round picks.  Consistently nabbing guys in the second round that are at least of rotational value is definitely noteworthy.  GTJ, Will Barton, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton and Allen Crabbe were all second round picks that have had at least stints or more of decent rotational value.  These were all picks made under Neil Olshey.  Yes, you can definitely argue that our first round picks are not very successful.  Obviously Dame and CJ as first round picks were both A+, but as of recent, we've had some less than stellar picks.  The Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan first round picks both in 2017 probably being the worst.  Anfernee Simons as a late first in 2018 is still up for debate, but he's starting to look like a good player as of late.  Overall though, grading the Olshey era of drafting, I'd say the Blazers have been slightly above average."
"unless he was counting on poor health, i doubt he chose the blazers for minutes. they had nurkic and kanter at center, melo and djj/covington at power forward, and zach collins at both"

Zach Collins exists.
did you say mean things about Zach Collins?  That's the quickest way to trigger them...
"How does this always happen to us? I mean seriously. Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, the full squad of injuries the year LMA left I believe it was, Zach Collins, Rodney Hopd, Nurk, CJ. We have so many long term injuries every year it’s so damn hard to get excited for a season anymore."
"Nurk half the season, CJ at least a week, Zach Collins likely most of the season."
"CJ, Nurk, and Zach Collins so far.  Dame got banged up last game and this one too"
we talking about luka or zach collins?
"I genuinely cannot believe that article.   Some writer said no to CJ and Zach Collins for James Harden?  Yeah man I've lost all respect for SBNation writers, that's the absolute epitome of being lost in the fucking zeitgeist.   If someone offers you James Harden for your left nut and a vial of your blood you give it to them and dont look back."
Zach collins :(
Zach Collins
"&gt; So you honestly don't think someone like Nerlens Noel could do most of what Zach Collins does?  I don't get where you're going with this.  What exactly do you think we are gaining by not extending Collins this year?  &gt; He's really not as good as Blazers fans make him out to be  Maybe not, but he's certainly better than Nerlens Noel, younger than Nerlens Noel, and has more potential than Nerlens Noel.  And again not re-signing Collins has absolutely nothing to do with our ability to sign Noel."
"Zach Collins, a young C/PF. Tall, very active on defense, adequate shooter. We have a lot of hope for him."
That doesn't make any sense.  We're already going to be capped out.  Letting Zach Collins and his 5 million dollar contract go aint gonna make it so we can go sign someone.
Zach Collins can literally never stay healthy. Not worth giving an extension. Would rather free up that spot for someone else in the offseason plus I've never really been as high on him as other Blazers fans.
"Zach Collins out for the season, then Nurk breaks his wrist, now CJ is getting an MRI, and dame ends the game grimacing. Fuck man"

No one wants Zach Collins...
"Kanter has been great tbh. The problem been Stotts insistence on playing melo a ton, and not having Zach Collins to play next to him"
"Rodney Hood, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, all the draft picks for Harden.  Dame/CJ/Harden + RoCo and Kanter/Giles starting and backing up the 5."
I’ll raise you one Zach Collins as blame totem
"I think there's three things that worry me with this question:  1. Nurk needs to come back to at least 90% of what he was in 2019. Their fucked if he isn't, he's crucial to everything Portland does - even more so than CJ. 2. Stotts is a very flawed coach. He doesn't make adjustments on defense or offense, and has consistently failed in the playoffs and just makes Portland rely on the individual offensive talent of Dame and CJ. If Stotts is replaced by a better coach (I don't see this happening this year) or magically gets better than Portland's ceiling dramatically increases IMO.  3. Zach Collins being out is genuinely a big deal. He's crucial to Portland's defense on the bench, as Melo and Kanter are both atrocious. He was vital in Portland's 2019 run. We still don't know if he's playing this year and I'm not optimistic.   So if at least two of these three things happen I can see Portland making a Conference Finals run. If not, I see a first round exit and a second round exit if we're lucky"
So he's kinda like Zach Collins in that regard.
"He's really really good.  Like gives me nightmares that we drafted Zach Collins over him.  The guy is an offensive force, and not a terrible defender either.  He isn't perfect, wouldn't want to max him, but he's very very good."
"It was my initial suspicion after the Okongwu and Gallinari acquisitions happened. Then people like Zach Lowe predicted that they would end up reaching an extension with John Collins still, there was enough buzz I kinda cooled off on my initial thought process. And I could still see them doing it, but yeah it's very possible he is gone.   I agree the role he's in just entirely being a play finisher on pick and rolls isnt what he wants, and it's not going to change as long as he's in Atlanta. Think it would take a max for him to seriously consider staying with Atl, and I dont think Atl is gonna voluntarily offer one. The question is if another team gives him a max offer sheet this summer will they match, definitely get why you suspect they wont.  Ive said in the past this is also partly why I would explore Collin's trade value right now. But it's a fine line to tread they really want to make the playoffs this year. If I could trust Gallinari to stay healthy it would be alot easier to"
"Yeah I think itll continue to lead to tensions after a certain amount of time. Those who win will probably have more leeway and sustainability with how long their teams let them go with it.   But at the end of the day this league is about stars and ultimately that leads to enabling them, I suspect over time if this really becomes an issue Lloyd Pierce will be gone and if Trae really forces their hand they will pick Trae over John Collins next offseason and Trae will get what he wants. That entire Houston culture people have Zach Lowe have talked many times how it was enabling Harden. Same thing happens with alot of young stars,   Trae's defense hasnt been as atrocious this year as the first 2 but Im gonna need like half a season not 8 games to actually buy he has improved to some extent on that end. Him getting away with being as much of a joke on defense as he's been is also a byproduct of him just being able to get away with it and enabled to some degree."
"Blazers would probably keep dame, cj, nurk, roco, jones jr, hood, simons, little , and rights to Zach Collins maybe? We have a lot of fa's this year. (Also not sure how fa rights even work tbh)"
What about Zach Collins?  Sacramento banks on Collins getting healthy and Blazers bank on Bagley reaching his potential.
"Not sure what the Blazers would trade for Draymond? I think they want to keep CJ and Dame. But is Zach Collins, Nurkic, Covington and a multiple first round picks enough to get Draymond? 3 lightly protected Blazers picks, a mid-level prospect in Collins and a pair of solid if unspectacular starters in Covington and Nurkic enough to part with an All-Star?   I think Covington fits really well around Curry and Nurkic/Collins helps to fill the front court void but is that along with 2-3 future firsts with 1-4 protections really enough? I just don't see the Warriors trading Draymond. If the Blazers want to go for an All-In type move I think it would have to be for a player on a different team.   The Warriors are going to try and get Klay back and in 2022 possibly package Wiggins contract (which will have 1 less year on it), Weisman and that T-Wolves pick for another All-Star caliber player and make a run with the Big 3 plus 1. I just don't see Warriors ownership giving up Draymond for mostly spare parts."
"Death, taxes, and Portland fans on reddit overhyping Zach fucking Collins for some reason for the last 2 years"
"Look at the contract and look at the stats, if they can save some tax money and get someone to produce similar points and reb, you could really more on your guard play like they really do anyway. Imagine Zach Collins sliding in there with the warriors."
Zach Collins is our Messiah. He will cure all (except his shoulders and ankles...)
"Yeah everyone knows it. The problem is, when you sit down and actually try to re-design our rotation, it's hard to not have Kanter and Melo overlap. Just today there was a post on /r/ripcity asking folks to do just that and it didn't get a ton of great responses.   This is why Zach Collins was so important to the Blazers. Hes a guy who can play the 4 or 5 and give us good to great defense."

"Bro I felt the same way about Zach Collins. You might not have seen him play much, but young 7 footers get zero benefit of the doubt from the refs."
Can I interest you in Anfernee Simons and one lightly used Zach Collins?
Yes bc Gary Trent has been out. If Zach collins comes back eventually too...
"Problem is that any team who signs him to be a main piece is either gonna be disappointed that he didn't turn out,  or if he did blow up, will lose him in the of season since he would be on a min deal with no bird rights. Also with his history he might get injured in the shortened season. It is like a lose lose scenario.   Portland signed him not as a starter, or even rotation player initially, but for depth. He may get expanded minutes now that Zach Collins is going to be out indefinitely though."
"Zach Collins is likely out for the rest of the season. I think Melo will now be able to get consistent minutes, although I wonder if those minutes would be better served with Harry Giles."
That's not a nice way to talk about Zach and John Collins astronaut father
Zach Collins and Dejounte Murray got some good bone structure. Zach Lavine could steal my girl too
"Hood is a pretty negative player right now on that contract, and Kanter's minutes would be soaked up by LMA (and he does absolutely nothing for us in either the long or the short term)  So it's basically, is an injured, soon-to-be FA Zach Collins worth anything? He's expected to miss almost the rest of the regular season...and then somebody might overpay for him this offseason forcing you to match (bad outcome) or let him go (also a bad outcome)  He missed almost all of last year, and may miss all of this year.  He has never been a plus player on an NBA court.   So I don't know why exactly it's a hard pass unless you still believe that Collins will be really good next year, worth a bigger contract coming off two missed years."
"No mention of the Blazers who have been playing without their 2nd and 3rd best players for most of the season? Plus another potential starter (Zach Collins) out for the season?  Blazers depth is the only reason they remain in the playoff hunt despite being the most injured team in the entire league. They will have a full 10 man rotation available again after the All Star break:  PG: Lillard, Anfernee Simons SG: CJ, Trent Jr. SF: Derrick Jones, Rodney Hood PF: Covington, Melo C: Nurkic, Kanter  And that's not including fast improving Nassir Little and out for the season Zach Collins. Little may be good enough to fight for the starting SF spot next season."
"I don't think either team does this, but Zach Collins+ CJ Elleby for PJ Tucker, straight up.    I would rather have Collins if he were healthy, but he's missed a lot of time recently.  I don't think he will be in rhythm or have chemistry come playoff time, and he needs a new contract next year, both for which are detrimental for a 'contending' team in Portland.  Tucker is very reliable and a strong vet.  He provides defense and 3pt shooting, which would be a great complement for our back court.    Elleby is an unknown.  In a couple of games, he's shown potential, especially that 76er game where we had only 1 starter and 6 missing players total.  But, one game isn't enough to give him high value.  I would think the Blazers would be higher on him than any other team.  Still, I think Rockets could be smart to take a swing on Collins.  Worst case, he's expiring.  Best case, he has a lot of potential.  You could argue he overlaps with Wood, but I think they could coexist.    I would be sad to see Z. Collins leave and not fulfill his potential here.  But, if we do not have him involved in a bigger trade deal before the deadline, I'd like to see him swapped with Tucker"
"He has a baby face but is 7 fucken feet tall, Zach Collins -esqe"
"Zach Collins, the Portland bench-warmer"
"Zach Collins  Every time I see someone post about him they just look at his stats and think he's trash, but he's a legitimately elite rim protector with great lateral quickness  Offensive game just isn't there, but 3 and D centers are super valuable"
Zach Collins is a huge shit talker. He got into with Klay last time they were both healthy. Go ahead with your 26 minutes and 7 ppg.
"Cp3 was crucial in that run though. Him going down forced them into a single style, which led to the desperation and famed 0/27. He let Harden thrive playing off ball, which made it harder to deal w him.   I agree Nurk is better overall than Capela, but Capela fits the role that the team needed better. Nurk couldn’t run the oop, meaning he had to always come up and PnR, relying on his hook shot. Capella excelling at the oop helped outside shooters thrive. Nurk was a decent midrange shooter but he always clogged the mid with screens someone else (Zach Collins) could’ve set. It’s the biggest weakness of both our bigs thats worsened by our lack of size making it near impossible to pressure rim"
"Idk man, Zach Collins has been injured. Don't think he will be an All Star this year."
"Zach Collins is pretty decent but not anywhere close to All-Star level, and isn't he hurt anyway?"
I think I’ve seen Zach Collins chew gum on the bench dejected more than I’ve seen him play basketball.
"from what I can tell they're all like this.  Putting the ""fan"" in fanatic.  I also subscribe to r/ripcity since I live in Portland and they're all convinced that Zach Collins &amp; Anfernee Simons will be all-stars, that Neil Olshey is a top 5 GM (or that he's the worst in the league) and that Terry Stotts should be fired because he can't make a line-up that features Dame, CJ, Melo &amp; Kanter good on defense."
"Rodney Hood for PJ Tucker CJ McCollum for Blake Griffin Sign likely soon to be released Demarcus Cousins And if so, cut Zach Collins Throw around picks here and there."
"Nurk would need to return to pre-injury Nurk (which he really has never done, unfortunately) and CJ would have to maintain his level of play from earlier this year, and Zach Collins would have to become useful and healthy.  But if so? The pieces are there. There's absolutely no reason that a fully healthy, firing-on-all-cylinders Blazers team can't beat the Lakers, Nets, Clippers, Bucks, Jazz, whoever in a 7-game series."
He had an amazing call of [Zach LaVine's game winner](https://youtu.be/ncXFk74dMfc). I don't know what ur talking about dude. Collins is my favorite team announcer other than our guys
"Hey man, honestly props for you for trying to use a level of analysis and deep thought. I guess you somehow missed that we upgraded from Mario Hezjona and Zach Collins to RoCo and DJJ, a confident Simons that can hit threes and cover ball handling duties and Gary Trent Jr hitting threes and defending. But sure, go off on a small sample of games where your best effort at rebuttal is to shit you pants and say “duuurrrr record”."
All of them. As true blazer fan I was sitting in my company’s section when I said Zach Collins Gary and Davis was our future I got laughed at. That’s was 2017 since than I’ve had very wealth business man buy me a Zach Collins jersey but I think they owe two more jerseys if you ask me.
"yeah absolutely like the other version was just ""oh he got it we lost lol who cares"" it was really lame for the warriors commentators to do like i understand the pain but FOR EXAMPLE   eric collins on the zach lavine game winner against the hornets last year still made it awesome for bulls fans"
"Nurkic had a horrid injury that kept him out a long time, I don’t think he is injury prone. Zach Collins maybe... but how can being injury prone NOT be bad luck??? Getting covid is often a result of someone not following covid guidelines. It can be prevented."
Zach collins of all people destroyed us this year
"17th pick is averaging 10 ppg. That seems like a pretty average quality 17th pick.  &gt;sixth men in college don't often go in the first round.  It happens fairly regularly these days. As long as the team they are on is one of the best. Portland alone drafted two of them in recent drafts: Zach Collins (10th in 2017) and Nassir Little (25th in 2019).  &gt; do you think Donte's National Championship MVP caused him to be overvalued in the draft?  Overvalued is hard to say, but yes it definitely got him drafted higher. A month prior he was viewed as a late 1st or early 2nd, and a candidate to possibly stay in college another year."
Zach Collins for me whenever he isn't hurt. That fucking guy.
"At the end of the day, Trae has had Collins and Capela, two guys who have played more games than Lauri and Carter. He has a relatively deep Hawks team. Yet they're sitting at a worse record than the Bulls while also having a worse team net rating. Meanwhile Jaylen Brown avgs less assists than Zach (has had 0 assists in 3 of last 6 games), and the Celtics are only 1.5 games ahead of Bulls. For me, Trae's biggest knock is the variance in his performances. His biggest off games shooting often results in losses - he has had much worse games than Zach, you can go through the gamelogs yourself"
"Which was also when nurkic got injured, so there’s the 2nd and 3rd best players being out longer and will continue to be out longer than the mavs. Let alone the additional concussions, muscle strains and indefinite zach Collins injury"
"Don’t know why you’re saying you like I’m a Blazers fan. Zach Collins, Nurkic, and Cj are all staters and they’re out."
The COVID excuses don't hold any water when compared to Portland. McCollum and Nurk and Zach Collins and Nassir Little and Rodney Hood. Portland has been the most injured team in the league.
Zach Collins ain’t worth it for blazers
"They'll sign him to a new contract, even if they have to let Zach Collins go."
Just imagine if we had Zach Collins...
"Everyone playing to maximum potential on this roster basically.  Everyone was in pretty solid shape before season.  They only have 14 players on roster also.  Nassir Little was out for most of season also...no Zach Collins yet either.  If we have zach collins, nurk, and CJ back...we are going to be very strong team at end of season."
"Zach Collins was picked at #10.  Meyers Leonard was picked at #11.  Instead of making moves to maximize the core they have &amp; give Damian Lillard the best chance to win the title, he drafts long-odds project players that won't develop (if they do at all) until well after Dame &amp; CJ have hit their primes.     If you think Olshey belongs anywhere ahead of Bob Myers, Masai, Dennis Lindsey, Danny Ainge, Sam Presti, Pat Riley, RC Buford/Brian Wright, Donnie Nelson, Daryl Morey, Sean Marks, Tim Connelly, Lawrence Frank or Rob Pelinka/LeGM you are high on bath salts."
"He's not high variance at all. He's consistently good at drafting and amazing at trades. Free agency is where he lacks, and thats largely because no one wants to come to Portland, and even then, he's been good at re-signing the people we get through trades, and had solid vet min signings in Seth Curry and Kanter two years ago. He wasnt the only GM to hand out bad contracts in 2016. And his draft record is great, obviously there's Dame and CJ, but the rest of his picks have all been late firsts or 2nds, and almost every player becomes at least a rotation player, which is a great value for how late he gets them.   Zach Collins, while worse than all those guys, still had/has a lot of potential, he's just been injured. Those guys were all mid-late firsts, which means they weren't sure fire hits, you can't fault him for that, that's hindsight bias. Olshey is a top 10 GM imo"
"You lost me at ""great GM"" with Olshey.  He's incredibly high variance, his moves are either great or utter trash fires.  He's out of consideration given how badly the 2016 FA class went for the Blazers, I'm sorry but there's just no way that a guy who gave $200M to Moe Harkless, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner is in the conversation given the competition out there.  Also, his draft record is spotty at best, trading 3 picks to move up &amp; take Zach Collins ahead of Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, OG Anunoby and more disqualifies him."
"That would be awesome, we'll make you a deal.  If you promise not to offer Gary Trent Jr a huge contract we'll let you have Zach Collins because we know MJ likes big white guys"
"The 1st in the East sixers lost to us without lillard, CJ, Nurk, Derrick Jones jr, Zach Collins, and nassir little"
"What would the All Empty Calorie Team be?  Clearly:  C - Drummond  PG - Westbrook  For the rest, how about:     SF - Andrew Wiggins  PF - John Collins  SG - Zach Lavine"
People forget that Zach Collins didn't play in the series against the Nuggets and didn't have anything to do with winning that series.
Also people forget that the Zach Collins and Enes Kanter frontcourt is what got them to the WCF 2 years ago
"Blazers when healthy has a bench of   - Anfernee Simons - Gary Trent  - Carmelo Anthony - Zach Collins - Enes Kanter  As well as Rodney hood, Harry Giles and Nasir Little"
"I've always been a big fan. no one had an Alex smith story this year, but it's good that there's an actual award to give to guys like that. that said, a lot of guys go through a Ben Roethlisberger-esque comeback season. he like destroyed his entire elbow but I think a guy like KD is a shoe in for it with his year.   Steph was held out to ""protect him"" so they could get a better pick. I don't think that's the same as KD or like Jonathan Isaac next year. maybe a guy like Zach Collins could get some shine someday after his issues."
"Kanter is good when he has a good help defender playing PF next to him. The Kanter/Melo minutes this year are disastrous, and the Kanter/Aminu minutes last time he was in Portland weren't anything special either.  Last time he was in Portland (18-19), the Kanter/Zach Collins two man lineup had a +21.9 net rating across 11 playoff games, and a +9.8 net rating across 14 regular season games. Meanwhile the Kanter/Aminu two man lineup was -5.9 in 14 playoff games, and +3.7 in 20 regular season games.  This year, the Kanter/Covington two man lineup is +11.0 across 23 games and 355 minutes, and Kanter/Jones is +8.8 across 21 games and 263 minutes, while Kanter/Carmelo is -3.4 across 24 games and 302 minutes.  Basically Kanter is playable and in many cases very good but only if his 4 can cover up his defensive deficiencies."
Money wise this works doubt that Cavs go for it though: Rodney Hood and Zach Collins/Nassir Little for Larry Nance. Not really a dream trade but a somewhat realistic trade I want to happen.
"pre-injury Nurk was much better, even so his touch was always kinda iffy and he's always been pretty methodical with everything he does.  I think the RoCo trade was decent process when they made the move, unfortunately it hasn't panned out well.  My biggest criticism of it was that it was probably 2 years too late to get him (I thought the same thing when they finally traded for Ariza last year, he'd have been the ideal fit next to Dame &amp; CJ like 4 years ago but instead the Blazers had ET &amp; Harkless).   Trust me, I am driving the ""Neil Olshey is culpable"" bandwagon.  He's extremely high variance and I don't trust his process/strategy much at all.  Drafting Dame &amp; CJ=excellent.  Deciding that the seemingly frisky playoff team was worth paying &amp; they were one ET away from truly contending=cripplingly bad.  Nurkic trade=home run.  Drafting Zach Collins &amp; Anfernee Simons=kinda bad.  Drafting Gary Trent Jr.=good.  Dude is all over the map which is equivalent to shitting the bed in a small market."
"it's hard to be Steph Curry off the ball (he's a 1 of 1 in that regard), and as you say doubly so without other + playmakers around him, particularly at a forward/big spot who can be the release valve on a PnR action.  You nailed it, it's tough to find complimentary pieces for their core with its inherent limitations.  They need a more mobile 5 that can do more on offense than Nurkic does and/or a complete wing creator rather than the frankenstein rotation they've had for the last 5-6 years of guys who can all do different things but nobody who does everything.  Like sure, Nurk can play drop and protect the rim a little and he can do some things in the high post as a passer to find cutters, but he's not a legit scoring threat and frankly pretty below average as a PnR finisher.  If you had one/both of Bam Adebayo (could've drafted him instead of Zach Collins) and a TJ Warren/Gordon Hayward then Dame would be able to do much more off the ball and the Blazers would have an easier time finding success (duh, good players make it easier)."
Zach Collins with a below-average # of nagging injuries becomes Myles Turner.
If y’all had Jusuf and Zach Collins that would be a much better combo than Kanter and Covington
"We're also missing Zach Collins, season ending surgery for him"
No Zach collins too
"Oh great... another stat geek who probably hasn’t attended a single econometrics class in his life is citing a bunch catch-all stats without post estimation test results. Cool.  And RAPTOR WAR, seriously? That thing currently has FVV, Jerami Grant, and John Collins to be above Kevin Durant and Giannis btw. A really solid stat from 538.   And fyi, Booker and Lavine are ranked at exactly same spot — 76. So going by RAPTOR WAR, if Zach and Booker were to switch teams, the Suns and the Bulls would still be at the same spot record-wise. So if the currently 15-9 Suns has Zach instead of Booker, would that make Zach an all star?"
"The Hawks aren’t that much better. 11-13 vs 10-14. Plus, Trae has better teammates in general. John Collins is better than any big we have.   Trae’s good but he’s nowhere near as good a player as Zach"
"&gt;: It's amazing how you can examplify what i was saying so effectively. On-off is more about who you play with then what you are contributing. As you explained so well.  It's amazing you can't understand the difference between on/off numbers between teammates and on/off numbers between #1 guys on different teams   &gt; ach Collins is poor often injured back-up center, the fact that you are counting him as a big ""missing piece"" kind of lets me know where you are at with this.   Bud I literally counted Dwight Powell.  And ""often-injured"" is hilarious when you're talking about Kristaps ""literally never finished a season healthy"" Porzingis.    &gt; Bottom line is that the Mavs have been missing large parts of their staring line-up and important bench guys for most of the season, to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Bottom line is that the blazers have been missing their 2nd AND 3rd best players for 12 out of the 23 games, have missed Zach Collins the whole season, and Derrick Jones Jr, Covington, Hood, Nassir, Anfernee have all missed more than one game.   &gt; to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Well that's just a flat lie because Tim Hardaway has literally played 24 games lmao.  They played maybe one game with no starters?  So same as us."
"&gt; Covington has almost the exact same onoff as Dame because he 95% of his minutes with Dame on the floor, shocker   It's amazing how you can examplify what i was saying so effectively. On-off is more about who you play with then what you are contributing. As you explained so well.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; And every single game but one we were missing not one of those guys, not two of them,   Zach Collins is poor often injured back-up center, the fact that you are counting him as a big ""missing piece"" kind of lets me know where you are at with this. Bottom line is that the Mavs have been missing large parts of their staring line-up and important bench guys for most of the season, to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up."
"&gt; No missing 5-7 guys is not the same as missing 2.  ...is this a joke?  How is that what you think is happening LOL  Nurkic, CJ, and Collins have missed a combined 47 games.    Richardson, Porzingis, DFS, Kleiber, and Powell have missed a combined 45 games.  And every single game but one we were missing not one of those guys, not two of them, but all three. Plus Nassir Little who dropped 30 his last game has missed 15 games and Roco and DJJ took turns going down while already down CJ, Nurk, and Zach.    &gt; According to on off numbers Convington is the best player on the Blazers. You see how that is probably not true?  Covington has almost the exact same onoff as Dame because he 95% of his minutes with Dame on the floor, shocker.  You see how looking at two guys on the same team sharing minutes isn't the same as how a team performs in the minutes their best player isn't on the floor?"
"So at worst they've been dealing with similar missed time problems, but one guy is 13-10 and one guy is 11-14.    &gt; CJ and Nurkic each played 13 games so there isn't much difference in time missed.  Nurkic played 12, and Zach Collins literally hasn't played and plays the same spot.  So our center rotation is Enes Kanter and Harry Giles.    &gt; on-off numbers don't tell you much, because you don't know who else is sitting in that time, if they are playing their entire bench line-up or like to stagger. If their bench unit is better than the opposing bench unit etc.  They tell you a lot.  Our 2nd best player has been either Enes Kanter or Gary Trent Jr for the majority of the season.  We have to play carmelo anthony next to Enes Kanter for significant portions of every game."
"We’ve literally played the majority of our season with our 2nd and 3rd best players missing. Not to mention Zach Collins gone for the season, and dame roco djj nassir hood and anfernee all missing games.   Our second best player has been enes Kanter"
"The blazers have played games without CJ, Nurk, Roco, DJJ, Little, and Zach Collins... that’s the entire starting lineup and some backups. There are plenty of solid points to say that curry is better than dame, but saying the warriors have dealt with injured is not one of them"
"Others have already mentioned the Sports Illustrated article and ESPN airing his high school games.   I’ll also note that 2001 was one of the best and most hyped college seasons of all time.   Duke: Jay Williams, Duhan, Dunleavy, Battier, Boozer  Maryland: Juan Dixon, Steve Blake, Chris Wilcox  UNC: Forte and Haywood  Michigan State: Jason Richardson and Zach Randolph  Arizona: Gilbert Arenas, Richard Jefferson, Luke Walton, Jason Gardner, Loren Woods   UCLA: Jason Kapono, Earl Watson, Matt Barnes, Dan Gadzuric  And despite Duke winning the national title they arguably weren’t even the best team that year....which was   Stanford: 31-3 with Casey Jacobsen, Jason Collins and Jaron Collins   My point is, the void left from Jordan and the insane quality of college basketball put extra attention on non NBA athletes and the next up and coming great.   Lebron was billed a hybrid of Magic + Jordan. He was flashy in high school but also physically dominant like Jordan.   It was an era of Kobe vs. Iverson, post Jordan iso basketball on low efficiency and Lebron had those tools but was passing the ball like Magic Johnson. He was different and transcendent in his style of play.   The media hype was natural and deserved, he lived up to it and far exceeded it in many ways."
It is one of the worst. I was told Kyle for Maxey and Tybulle is a bad trade but the same person posted that we should trade Kyle Lowry to Portland for Zach Collins and fillers.
"The death knell was the summer of 2017. They had a healthy Dame, CJ, Nurkic, and *three* first round picks. PG and Butler were both on the trade market.   What did they do?  Traded two of the firsts to take Zach Collins, used the third one on Caleb Swanigan. That was when I knew the team was incapable of ever competing. So silly they haven’t made any real move to help Dame and just let every other Western Conference team pass them by. Covington was a good move but it’s far too little too late."
"2017 draft on the other was pretty bad tho lol Lonzo, Fultz, Josh Jackson, Ntilikina, DSJ, Zach Collins, Malik Monk, Luke Kennard, all didn't pan out. Imagine if I told you that that you your team has a 57% chance at drafting a disappointment"
Wait they moved up to draft Zach Collins 💀.  the Heat have had bad draft picks but they never traded up for a bust lol. Heat got screwed out of D. Rose. And they drafted Justice Winslow because he was supposedly BPA and Devin Booker was already drafted
"Yep, reallllly fucked us. I care less about the 26 pick but Zach Collins killed us.  But we didn't have 20 and 15 we just had 10 through a trade with SAC  Bam, Mitchell, John Collins, OG, shit even Jarrett Allen."
"For people who want to say Zach Collins has been a bust (understandable, he can’t stay on the court), the two players we traded for him in that draft ended up worse lol. Justin Jackson’s now been released by his 3rd team in 4 years and Harry Giles actually ended up on our bench for a minimum."
Zach Collins...
"Yeah that's the right way to look at it.   If the player wouldn't be traded barring the dumbest offer of all time that would literally never happen in any universe ever, they're untouchable   Obviously the Blazers would trade Dame + Zach Collins for Luka, Kristaps, and every single 1st and 2nd round pick the Mavericks had. But that's not a deal that exists"
Does Zach Collins exist or did I make him up in my dreams?
"For anyone wondering:  RHJ (on draft night) for Mason Plumlee + Pat Connaughton from Brooklyn   Plumlee for Nurk + a 1st from Denver a year later.   That 1st + another 1st to Sacramento for the 10th pick, Zach Collins.  Interestingly that Nuggets -&gt; Blazers -&gt; Kings pick was used to select harry Giles. who is also currently a Blazer."
Zach Collins but we keeping him.
Zach Collins looks like dude from Corpse Bride
I have never seen zach collins in my life
"Tyler Herro is black and Zach Collins is white, how could you confuse them for each other????"
"Blazers roster last season was decimated.   We were insanely tired just from making it because we had been so injured and had to go all out for 2 weeks  Beyond that, nurkic had just come back and wasn't himself. CJ had a broken back. Zach Collins and Ariza were both out, forcing us to **start literal G-league player** (&lt;250 minutes played in his entire career lol) at the 4 against AD. We guarded LeBron with 6'4 Gary Trent  It was just all around awful for us injury wise - in spite of that, we actually defended you better you than either the Nuggets or the Heat did.   Now we have a very solid frontcourt defensively that isn't going to be completely outmatched guarding LeBron and AD. No one is going to stop those 2, but DJJ/RoCo/Nurkic is at least a solid rotation to slow them up"
"Gonzaga has been putting some really high-quality players into the NBA lately. Hachimura, Sabonis, Clarke, Zach Collins are all decent to good players. Love seeing them do well, especially Rui. One of my fav College players ever"
"We finally have 8/9 of our intended players  Notes: the 9th us Zach Collins who would have been a rotation PF/C if he hadn't gotten re-injured pre-season, he is anticipated back around the last week of RS.  It is to be seen if we try to incorporate a player so late.  GTJ had earned a rotation spot and has been replaced with Norman Powell.  Very hard to argue this isn't an upgrade once he gets up to speed    I'll say this- if we can't be league average at defense from now (i.e. intended roster) until playoffs, we will be an afterthought.  I just think our ratings up til now are a crapshoot."
"i used within 5ft of the rim, not sure why 10 feet out counts (which drastically alters the results)  [gobert this year](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting/?sort=Less%20Than%205%20ft.%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*rudy%20gobert)  [zach collins 2 years ago](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting/?sort=Less%20Than%205%20ft.%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*zach%20collins)"
"Yeah, that's why we need Collins back. He worked great next to Kanter in our WCF run and really helps cover for his defensive shortcomings. Ideally Kanter would only play next to Zach and Melo would only play with Zach or Nurk."
imagine going from a rotation of two elite rim protectors (nurk and zach collins) to enes kanter and no other centers lol
Zach Collins for Zach Lavine.
Really glad we took Zach Collins instead of Bam or John Collins
Damn Zach Collins was 10th? Why?
... I literally listed the Bucks as a team that made a major fuck up. You can point to a bunch of mistakes those other teams made too. Nuggets traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Traded Beasley despite him going off when he got starter minutes and being an extremely athletic lights out shooter. Blazers traded up for Zach Collins who's mediocre at best when he's actually healthy instead of staying back and being able to draft OG Anunoby and John Collins (both high upside players who were projected as good picks). Jazz are building around Mitchell/Gobert as their core which isn't their fault but also just not good enough to win a championship.
"Portland fans, would you move Zach Collins for a defensive wing? We've got a bunch of them."
"They would need a roster on par with like the 2019 Raptors or current Jazz talent wise where 1-8 every dude is solid. Dame, Trent, CJ, Nurkic, Melo, and Covington are all solid. The Derrick Jones Jr role is the weak link, but he would be fine off the bench. Rodney Hood was also playing crunch time minutes for them and I just don't have much faith in him anymore. Even when Zach Collins is healthy he wouldn't be enough. They need defense. The dream replacement would be Draymond but that will never happen. The only hope would be to take a gamble on an Aaron Gordon type player or younger and hope you can turn them into Draymond lite. I don't see Dame and CJ breaking up either. It's not like CJ would fetch much. If you could replace CJ with like Gordon Hayward or Jaylen Brown that might help but again I would doubt that would happen. Maybe Myles Turner? But that may just create more problems."
They put zach collins on a technical free throw?
Zach Collins rocking his best Lonely Island fit tonight
What's the consensus about zach Collins? Are you guys moving on or trusting him to come back healthy next year?
[Zach Collins](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/970/542/3cd.jpg)
Zach Collins looks like that one picture of The Rock looking like a lesbian
Thanks tnt for reminding me that zach Collins is not a figment of my imagination. When's he coming back again??
Zach Collins just needs a Fanny pack to finish the look
Zach Collins got those crazy eyes
Las Vegas’s finest Zach Collins ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
We could have had him. Traded up for Zach collins instead. Yikes
How does this help Orlando if they're just going to have to extend Trent and Zach Collins? They're both RFAs after this year.
Zach Collins... come get him Pacers!
"totally, they could've done lots of things with the 3 picks they had, coming away with a project big man in Zach Collins is absolutely brutal."
Even giving him credit for Dame is generous. All of the work was done before he got here  The 2017 draft is the most unforgivable thing he’s done. Going into that draft with 3 draft picks and coming out with Zach Collins and Caleb Swannigan is an all time bad draft considering who would have been available in our range
"Simons/Melo/Kanter is without a doubt the worst defensive trio in the league.  You could put prime KG &amp; Ron Artest with them and they'd still give up points hand over fist.  It is unreal to me that Olshey gets such a pass from the fanbase, he's incredibly high variance so his good moves (drafting Dame &amp; CJ, the Nurkic trade) seem to outshine so much of the crushing whiffs he's also had (giving Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard $200M in one summer, trading up to draft Zach Collins instead of Donovan Mitchell/Bam/OG/John Collins, drafting Simons without a clear path to development/reps).  Granted building a title team in Portland is incredibly difficult, but the way he seems to escape all accountability is crazy to me."
"Olshey signed no back-up point guard this year because it's shit-or-get-off-the-pot time with Simons, gotta see if the project player he drafted with a win-now core is worth paying, the plan was always to give him run this year.     As for Kanter &amp; Melo, they were sinking the Blazers defense as a bench tandem before Nurkic got hurt this year, so not like the injuries have forced these dudes into action, they were getting run all year long already.  Perhaps it might have been a better plan to sign somebody besides Harry Giles to play minutes at the 5?  They knew Zach Collins wasn't going to be healthy and that Nurkic is always an injury risk, so they decided to spend a roster spot on Giles who has never been more than a 15 MPG guy with a checkered medical history of his own."
Where the hell is Zach Collins
"Zach Collins, Enes Kanter, Rodney Hood, 2021 2nd, 2022 First  Collins to build up/around, the picks to supplement, Kanter/Hood as cap filler.  And then we just accept that we'll be terrible after Dame's prime is over and we have no picks."
"Steven Adams, Josh Hart, and a 1st round pick  Zach Collins, Gary Trent Jr, and a 1st round pick  Robert Williams, Pritchard, and a second round pick"
Yeah and Jimmy &gt; Zach and Lauri id do the trade again. Id just draft John Collins instead of him
Shucks  Edit: wait I’d also take a flyer on Zach Collins. Have y’all given up on him??
"People sleeping on our young guys. Gary is 22, nassir is 21, anfernee is 21, and there’s still Zach Collins(who obviously is a big if at this point)"
Nassir Little may end up being the best of the Zach Collins/Anfernee Simons/Gary Trent Jr draft pick group.
F Cam Johnson (health and safety protocols) out  F Zach Collins (ankle) out  F Harry Giles III (calf) out  G C.J. McCollum (foot) out  C Jusuf Nurkic (wrist) out
A shame Zach Collins can’t stay healthy... He could have been a nice trade chip...
"Everything I hear about Zach Collins make him sound like a great guy, but the dude just looks like an asshole"
I feel like Portland announcers could do that with a good Zach Collins dunk next year. That guy is a total dude.
"Jusuf Nurkic and CJ McCollum have missed the exact same amount of games as AD and Lebron, and while Dame only missed 6 games, he was playing while busted up and only playing to keep us afloat. During that time he played 11 games and was averaging 21 points at low efficiency. Zach Collins one of Blazer's best defensive players has been injured for the last two seasons. Please don't complain to a Blazers fan about injuries"
"Perennial losing to the eventual nba champions* other than the pels, every year the last 5 years we have lost to the warriors and the lakers. And non of those years have we been as healthy as we are now. We are still missing a major rotation piece in Zach Collins too. Say what you want but we have more playoff success than most other teams the last 5 years lmao."
except for Zach Collins. Who will probably break a finger or toe in his next return
"I did genuinely forget about Zach Collins, added him because I think others have to. Bro's been injured for like the past three seasons."
Rip Zach Collins.
We all need a hype man like Zach Collins
"People aren't really noticing the huge jump Portland has made since trading for Norm and getting Nurk back. Since that happened, we have like the 5th best net rating in the entire league. The Dame/CJ/Norm/Roco/Nurk starting lineup also has the #1 net rating in the league. We're a better team than we're being given credit for right now. We're absolutely blowing teams out of the water as of late with by far the best offense in the league (and around a league average defense).  The problems start with the bench though. Kanter is an absolute sieve. Zach Collins would fix so much shit if we had him as the backup 5 instead of Enes. Melo is a minus minus on defense but can space the floor. DJJ/Nas have been pushed out of the rotation by Terry and Simons gets the backup guard minutes (another negative on defense).  If Norman gets re-signed, which I assume he will, this team could be nice-nice. We'll see how things go in the playoffs this year though. This is by far the best roster from a net rating standpoint that we've ever had in the Dame era."
A healthy Zach Collins is able to give him some resistance
So what exactly is Zach Collins role on this team?
Zach Collins
"Or it could have been Zach Collins. That draft was great in hindsight, but you’d never know that yet when the deal happened. D Mitch almost didn’t even declare for the draft."
Not really. But Zach Collins is injured so keep that in mind
"While I feel bad for the Raptors a lot of teams have had struggles to deal with. Nuggets lost Murray, Nets had KD and Harden sitting out significant amounts of time, Lakers had AD and Lebron out, Blazers Jusuf Nurkic missed 35 games and CJ McCollum missed 25, and Zach Collins has been on the bench wearing pajamas for years. Oh yeah Golden State Warriors of course.. Etc, Etc.  It's almost a rare thing to see teams at FULL strength. Trying to keep players healthy is a lot of work and luck, and is part of the game"
You can be a homer and still be exciting. See [Eric Collins calling Zach Lavine's game winner against the hornets](https://youtu.be/FJ9pnTcGwxs?t=71) in 2019.

He was a crucial part of our WCF run while fasting for Ramadan and playing with a dislocated shoulder. But Nurkic is playing like his pre-injury self and Zach Collins is expected to return sometime during the playoffs so it looks like Kanter will see his minutes drop.
Zach Collins
"Zach Collins he’s a good defender, but he cant stay healthy"
Nah Zach Collins wasn't a starter in HS or college.
"I will never understand the Blazers fans love for Zach Collins. Can't stay on the court because he's injured, can't stay on the court when he's healthy because he's always in foul trouble.   Seriously, did he donate to Portland Public Schools or something? Is it the Gonzaga connection? What's with all the love?"
Zach Collins seems like a badass now lol.
Here’s the full sequence:  Draymond Green fouls Zach Collins  Foul upgraded to flagrant 1 (highly questionable btw)  Steve Kerr gets two techs and gets ejected  Draymond Green gets a tech  Damian Lillard makes 3 technical free throws  Zach Collins makes 2 flagrant free throws  Jake Layman makes a 3  https://youtu.be/qv7GbA0R76U
Didn't the Blazers have an 8 point possession after Zach Collins got under the skin of the Warriors?  There was a flagrant and some techs included iirc.
"We were missing CJ and Nurk for most of the year too and we are also without the rare and mythical Zach Collins, although he may just be a legend"
"Norvell Pelle, Noah Vonleh, Jordan Bell, khem Birch, Zach Collins, Henry Giles, Alize Johnson"
The idea of Zach Collins is way better than the actual Zach Collins
Friends S15E19: The One Where Zach Collins Wears a Patchwork Jacket
Wasn't Zach Collins the one defending Jokic
Zach Collins + refs help him look better in the playoffs
I wish we had the corpse of Zach Collins  Idk why people think Zach is a bad defender. It's literally what he's here for. Dude has lead the league in DFG% at the rim in 2/3 seasons he's played
wtf u mean? zach collins not even playing lmao
"What do you mean? Are you not intimidated by the wall of defense that is Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony and the corpse of Zach Collins?"
When is Zach Collins gonna be back? I don't think I've ever seen this dude play. Any time I've seen the Blazers he's cheering in street clothes
"We're more down on Terry Stotts than any individual player right now. I'd probably have a better opinion of Melo and Kanter if we had a coach that would limit them to the match-up dependent role players that they are instead of making them a featured part of our rotation.   I've never been a trade CJ guy (unless a great trade comes along obviously) but now that we've acquired Norman Powell, it just doesn't make sense to have CJ anymore. Re-sign Norman for 20-25M per year next season (CJ for reference makes fucking 30M+), and trade CJ for something else. Whether it's a Tobias Harris/Harrison Barnes swap, or a young dude (Deandre Hunter would be a dream) + expiring's/draft picks, it just doesn't make sense to have him anymore now that we have Norm (who has plus plus measurables as a defensive 2).  In an ideal world we trade CJ for some kind of a forward, fire Terry, let Melo/Kanter expire into the sunset, Zach Collins accepts his QO, DJJ opts into his 2nd year and we re-sign Norman Powell to a 4 year 20-ish million dollar long term deal."
We drafted Zach Collins over him :(
"Those numbers include the players who opted out. But let's look at some 2016 all pros, which are the best players at each position. Brady, David Johnson, Leveon Bell, Greg Olsen, Odell, Antonio Brown, Kelechi Osemele, Alex Mack, Jack Conklin, Trent Williams, Khalil Mack, Vic Beasley, Jadaveon Clowney, Cameron Wake, Olivier Vernon, Damon Harrison,  Suh, Calais Campbell, Gerald Mccoy, Mosley, Zach Brown, Alec Ogletree, Benadrick Mckinney, Aqib Talib, Marcus Peters, Janoris Jenkins, Malcolm Butler, Landon Collins, Ha-Ha Clinton Fix, Chris Harris, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Marquette King, Cordarrelle Patterson, and Nate Ebner. All of those guys were all pros in 2016 and switched teams after that."
I wish we weren’t so 50-50 on him because I would absolutely want him coaching Zach Collins in the offseason.
Zach Collins probably.
"sit the fuck down Zach Collins, you're injured"
Zach Collins thinks everything is a foul
When was the last time Zach Collins wasn’t injured? Feel like he’s been a staple on bench for years
Portland - CJ and Nurk for most of the season. Zach Collins all season. Dame for a few months.   We may be on the outside of contender status but we barely had a chance to gel as a team due to injury.  Never had a chance to play defense because of Stotts but Spolestra should take care of that problem. /s
Zach Collins for Zion take it or leave it
I agree he sucks. KP is worse.  You guys need a solid rebounder defender. Nothing fancy. You have enough scoring. Zach Collins would be perfect if he could stay on the court.  Julius Randle would also be phenomenal.
I've already told you dude. Read the comments and ingest the information instead of just waiting for your chance to word vomit inaccurate negativity.  Kanter's minutes would've been replaced by Zach Collins. This is neither a Terry or Neil (roster construction) problem since he re-broke his ankle during preseason training camp. It was on Terry to play Kanter over Rondae Hollis Jefferson and Harry Giles at the 5.   Melo's minutes could've been replaced by Derrick Jones Jr and/or Nassir Little. DJJ was our max MLE free agent signing and Nassir Little was a promising 2nd year 1st round pick.  Dame sits for a whole 8-10 minutes a game. During that period we played Anfernee Simons at guard who's a deadly scorer (way more efficient than Carmelo fucking Anthony).  You're just speaking straight nonsense right now. Go away.
"....Neither Nurk or Powell were playing right after allstar.  Was 15/36 games past allstar break before we got them.    [22 games into Nurk's return we were 17th on defense and 1st on offense](https://theathletic.com/2570580/2021/05/06/are-these-blazers-better-than-the-2019-conference-finalists-dont-throw-water-on-the-idea/).  The last 15 games of the season we were 18th on defense.  So again, you're wrong.  We already had an around average defense whenever Nurk was playing.  The last two years Nurk played we had the 5th and 17th best defenses respectively.      Simply not having to play Kanter(getting a backup center, possibly Zach Collins getting healthy) and having Nurk for the season would take us to ""not awful""."
"Bruh, you're talking about Melo and Enes like they're fixtures on this team. They ain't part of the ""core"", what are you even trying to say?   The core pieces are Dame/CJ/Norman/RoCo/Nurk. Then you've got DJJ and Zach Collins off the bench (both plus defenders too).  If you think that roster is the 2nd worst defensive personal in the league, then you simply don't know basketball."
" Zach Collins 1v1 vs Jokic isn’t really changing anything lol, that’s pretty minor. And he picks up hella fouls too"
"I know people will laugh, but Zach Collins."
"It’s definitely a thing on here too, but r/NFL does it really bad too. I’m just not really much of an American football fan at all anymore, so I don’t go over there much at all.  Caruso, Pritchard, Herro(though he may actually deserve the praise if this season was just an off one), Robinson(he’s good, but this sub overrates him), Hartenstein(bi-racial, but definite looks more white than not), Semanic, Poku, Zach Collins, Markkanen(less now, but especially in his first and second year), Kaminsky, and more that I’m not listing because I feel like this is a sufficient enough list as an example. Lol.  There are plenty of white players plenty deserving of praise and those who truly are a bit underrated, but this sub gets obsessed with random ones who have a good game once or twice in a season it seems like."
Jrue + Middleton + Pick for Dame + Zach Collins   Giannis and Dame can get it done.
"If Zach Collins is healthy and productive, sure. But if not, do we have someone on the team who is objectively going to be better than Melo? Perhaps Nas Little will make a big leap over the summer."
"&gt;I'm honestly just shocked your guys FO haven't made much moves to improve in that area in the past few years, as you guys get a winning record every single year and have one of the best players in the league(my personal favorite non-Sun), I really think you guys would easily be serious contenders if you just moved the balance a little bit further towards being a 2 way team. Even ""average"" defense would make you guys so damn good...  Believe me, I have a lot of animosity towards Neil Olshey right now. The only really good move he's made was to bring in Nurk. Single handedly saved our season that year and probably saved NO's job. Otherwise, his roster construction sucks. I mean... Dame wanted us to draft Donovan Mitchell, and instead we go for Biggie Swanigan and Zach Collins. Imagine how deadly our team would be if we had Mitchell as Dame's #2."
"Ya but according to my Blazer friends, if Zach Collins was healthy, they'd be top 5"
"I’m on the Butler train, he’d be great with dame and Nurk.   Cj, anfernee and picks probably, I’d rather give them Zach Collins on a mid level deal.  I’d also do cj, anfernee AND Collins with picks for Beal."
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"These three have the potential to be equitable:  CJ, Zach Collins and a 1st to the Bucks for Middleton.  CJ to Hornets for Hayward and a 1st.   CJ, Simmons and a 1st to Miami for Butler"
"Dude threw old ass Ariza, Rodney Hood, Danuel House and Zach fucking Collins in there 💀💀💀  By that logic we missed 21 games of Avery Bradley and 5 games of Playoff Rondo so it pretty much cancels out!"
the sad part is Dame told the Blazers front office he wanted them to draft him but they went w Zach Collins. Imagine if they got Mitchell and were able to sell high on CJ that year. Woulda been insane
Swear dame was pushing hard for Mitchell to get drafted. And we drafted Zach Collins
Reminder the Blazers were set to draft Mitchell but Olshey took Zach Collins. Donovan even said Dame called him to tell him he's going to Portland at 11 for fuck sake Neil
Idk Powell is a FA that could walk. They gave up a 22 year old RFA to get him    He also traded 2 firsts for Covington. Drafted Zach Collins over Mitchell and Bam. Drafted Little over KPJ and Keldon Johnson. Used another first on Simons. Only recent signings were Melo and Kanter. Not the best job of surrounding Dame.
They picked zach Collins with a #10 pick
"His original sin was misjudging the Blazers roster &amp; ceiling in 2016, which he then compounded in 2017 by trading up to draft Zach Collins.  Olshey handed out $200M worth of contract to Evan Turner, Harkless, Meyers Leonard and Allen Crabbe in 2016 because that year's team overachieved in the regular season and beat the Clippers in the playoffs, BUT the Clippers lost CP3 and Blake Griffin to injuries that series.  The Blazers then looked semi-frisky against the Warriors (Steph was still recovering from his slip &amp; fall on the court vs. Houston) so Olshey decided to keep their team together and splurge on Evan Turner to try &amp; put the Blazers over the top.  He overpaid a bunch of mediocre players because the cap spiked, except he didn't take into account that Durant was definitely going to the Warriors (an open secret) and the Blazers probably had no realistic shot in the west as a result.  By 2017 the Blazers were locked into their roster so they didn't have open slots for multiple players despite having 3 picks in the draft.  Instead of using some of those picks to get off those abjectly terrible deals, Olshey traded up to take Zach Collins, a developmental project that wasn't going to be ready to help Dame &amp; CJ during their primes."
"While I agree with the ""hindsight is 20/20"" point to some extent, even at the time, trading up to 10 to get Zach Collins was questionable.  It was a reach at the time.  There is a good chance he would have fallen to 15, where we could have drafted him without giving up our 20th pick.  It wasn't just that we missed the one diamond in the rough, its isn't a Draymond going last situation.  There were multiple potential picks that people were high on at the time that we missed out on.    There has further been an overall inability to evaluate forwards.  Since LMA and Batum left, Portland's only forward that you'd actually want to start on a good team has been RoCo.  Otherwise we've had Harkless, Aminu, the shitshow that was 2019-20, and DJJ this season.  We got to the point where we were starting 6'3 Norman Powell to guards Denver's 6'10 forwards."
"Except Dame was vouching for Donovan Mitchell even texting him after the draft saying he wanted to play with him, and Portland picked fucking Zach Collins LMAO."
I don’t get how ppl can always do this hindsight thing without the obvious picks.. zach Collins is a decent player just that he is injured
Yeah Zach Collins contract situation will interesting to see lol
I cry every time I think about drafting Zach Collins over Bam Adebayo.
"this team had a coach who made kanter and melo (2 players that were either out of the league or were given away for free) major rotation players. 20+ minutes a night for each of em. That more than anything sank this team since they're so awful on defense and they had a coach who was committed to playing them, which created an accountability problem (if you were to watch nurk's post game session, this was obvious).  Keeping a core of Nurk/RoCo/Norman/Dame (and hopefully trading CJ + FRP's for a SF of some sort) is really nice. Zach Collins/Nassir Little/Derrick Jones Jr/Anfernee Simons are much better options to come off the bench than guys like Melo/Kanter, who just brick your entire team.  The org just needs to get this coaching hire correct, re-sign Norm and find a decent trade package for CJ (doesn't need to be a star, just need a better fit - like a Harrison Barnes type). And obviously move on from Kanter and Melo (who are FA's).   I just don't understand why it's so hard to picture fixing Portland."
"2 of those players played in the rotation because the coach was obsessed with them. The other 2 are above average-to-god-like offensive players who both have adequate size to play and defend the 1 (CJ playing SG for 24-28 minutes a game is problematic, I'll give y'all that).  The problem was mainly Terry Stotts. Nurk/RoCo/Powell/DJJ(Zach Collins when healthy) are absolutely ideal defensive players to have"
"if shelling out huge contracts for Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard won't do it, or drafting Zach Collins over Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White won't do it, this asinine shit is fine.  How does this MFer still have a job?"
"Zach Collins, Robin Lopez and Markief Morris? Yikes"
Zach Collins played 11 games last year and none this year. Thats a dude with more injuries than Porzingis and the potential of KP is still higher than him. KP was not a bad player for us last year at all.
Actually that would be a great deal tbh. You get a consistent 20ppg scorer / ball handler and Zach Collins has been injured one year and he has a lot of potential and a player you could sign for less than half what KP gets paid and can fill a similar role
trade him for McCollum + Zach Collins
"He's a billion times worse, but Zach  Collins"
"More like because Kawhi completely killed his value. The best trade offer we got for him was Ingram, 1 bad pick, and a bad contract. You guys almost certainly could've had Kawhi for McCollum, a first, and Zach Collins. Maybe a bit more but that's basically what the raptors trade was."
"i feel like the spurs would really like zach collins and nassir little, so if we were going to make a trade for someone like derozan it would be cj got the salary but it would be filled out with good value for a rebuild."
CJ &amp; Zach Collins for Love &amp; Sexton?
"I loved this video. Switching principals and having the whole team locked in on the same wavelength is so goddamn underrated. I know Portland has some poor defenders but we also have some players that are individually pretty good (Nurk/Zach Collins/RoCo/Derrick Jones Jr/Norman Powell). But my god, some of the switches we do (and non-switches) is just comical. No one knows what the other defender is thinking or expects, so it just either becomes never switch or switch every single time. Never any fucking nuance or strategy."
"I said then and I still say now that we should've gotten Dillon Brooks with our 10th pick that draft instead of bust Zach Collins, but I'm also biased because he and Jordan Bell led my college team to a final four. Grizzlies got a STEAL with him and I'm happy he's doing well with them."
"I agree, a team would probably try and pry away anfernee or Zach Collins as well."
"All traded except for Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, and Nassir Little"
A lot of them were traded away  We picked Ronde Hollis Jefferson in 2015 who was traded for Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton who we developed into an NBA player  Didn’t have one in 16 I don’t think   2017. We picked Zach Collins at 10 and Caleb Swannigan in the late 20s which considering the talent available in our range in that draft is a franchise altering disaster   18 we picked Anfernee Simons at 24 or 26 which was a good pick  19 we picked Nas Little who has shown flashes of being good but needs time  20 we didn’t have a pick
"I mean his defense would be welcome.  I like our roster, I mean we likely have to offload djj, Zach Collins to keep Powell.  I like djj but we did not utilize him right.  I'm worried we will pick up a bad coach, but we shall see."
"The GM and the fans thought Zach Collins would be a pretty good defensive 4 with okay shooting. Instead he's been hurt perpetually since draft day. I think they have to make a tough choice right now, and if they choose to keep pushing for a chip then they need to get rid of Collins and sign someone who can stay on the court."
"I appreciate this thoughtful response, cause my opinion entering the season was that Roco should’ve been a +defender (and Powell’s offense&gt;defense). Obviously it didn’t go as planned, but that’s why I wonder whether a healthy DJJ and Zach Collins could’ve made the difference vs “lack of coaching”"
"A healthy Zach Collins gets CJ a whole lot more good looks.Blazers were missing a piece, but it wasn't CJ's spot"
"Dame wanted them to draft Donovan Mitchell, but they ended up with Zach Collins. If he ran that ship they would have listened instead of being so dumb."
"I can’t wait until Zach comes back and he’s completely mediocre and people realize the thought of Zach Collins is way, way better than real life Zach Collins."
"Can’t wait for them to start trapping the p&amp;r every play with Dame and Zach Collins or some shit.  We were a bottom 10 defence with Giannis, can’t imagine what kind of disaster is awaiting Portland’s defence."
"Honestly curious was it coaching holding them back or the roster? No DJJ, Zach Collins or a vet bench guard probably was a bigger issue."
"Lol this. It is so obvious that lillard doesn’t need a backcourt mate. He needs 2 way players all around the team with good forwards. Backup center. Bring back nurk, Roco, Zach Collins and nas. The rest are just trading assets."
"Stotts was one of several issues holding the team back. The others include thinking CJ is a competitive second option, having no defense, and clinging to the idea that injury prone Nurk and 2 years off Zach Collins are enough to make a generally uncompetitive team competitive."
Zach Collins will start with KAT
“this is Zach Collins year!”
"Collins would be an elite rim protector if he got 10 fouls a game, otherwise not so much.  Also, he hasn't really shown the ability to string together a consistent run of solid play for any amount of time.  Is some of that due to injuries? Sure.  Does that matter at this point considering he's heading into RFA this summer and the Blazers need to decide on his future? No.  At some point you are who you are as a player, and betting on Collins' upside is a losing proposition considering the timeline on his contract and the fact that when he was drafted Dame was in his prime &amp; ready to win now.  It's nothing against Zach personally at all, it's just weird how precious some people get about him and the attitude of ""wait &amp; see, he'll be great eventually"" when he's done almost nothing to help a top 10 NBA player who wants to be in Portland actually win.  Also it's fair to call out Olshey &amp; the Blazers for making this choice given where the team was at that time."
"i have no idea why zach has so many passionate haters lmao  he basically missed two seasons from two unrelated injuries, but he's shown that he's an elite rim protector who can switch, can be a decent passer, and has an alright shot - a player with the potential to be a really solid 3&amp;D center who does all the little glue things is worth taking a shot on  now, that being said, was he the right pick in hindsight? of course not, but that's not entirely fair since you can say that about most drafts, but he's faaar from the fraud the anti-collins squad claims he is lol"
Zach Collins is a poor mans Tingus Pingus
"it shows how errors can compound and absolutely torpedo team building for sure.  They had a rough 2016 offseason, so then Olshey doesn't have roster spots for multiple draft picks in the 2017 draft, so he trades up to take a home-run swing on Collins.  Just imagine Derrick White in a back-court with Dame &amp; CJ instead of Biggie Swanigan, he's exactly the kind of guard they need.    2018 was also sneaky bad because instead of taking Simons, another home run swing that fit the Zach Collins timeline instead of the Dame &amp; CJ timeline, they could have drafted Jalen Brunson (playing crunchtime for Dallas and was in the 6MOTY convo this year) or they could have simply taken GTJ in the first, thereby giving the team another year of cheap control over his rights, which would've been critical for a super capped out team that needed bargain production!  If they'd just drafted GTJ over Simons, he'd still be on the team, but instead they had to trade him because he got too expensive too quickly and now Simons took so long to develop they have to make a decision on him without a ton of data to go off of.  I give him a pass on Nas Little in 2019, that late in the 1st it's tough to identify talent and he's actually shown some good flashes of potential as a piece they can use.  I've said it before &amp; will say it again, no coach in history could get passable defense out of a Simons/Melo/Kanter 2nd unit, that's on Neil much more than it is on Stotts."
"he'd have to be better than the rip city hive believes he is (and a significant chunk of them think he's really good.  I had one of them tell me Collins had ""legit unicorn potential"" and that he was clearly better than John Collins).  They traded 2 picks to get Zach Collins and surpassed multiple All-NBA players and one of the best wing defenders in the league to draft him.  You can say hindsight is 20/20 and maybe people had no idea Bam/Mitchell would be as good as they are, but even still the Blazers had 3 firsts in that draft and a bloated cap table, it probably would've been a better move to pay someone to take ET/Meyers/Harkless off their hands instead of drafting Collins who couldn't beat out Meyers Leonard for minutes and hasn't been able to stay healthy or put together 2 good weeks of basketball in 4 years."
"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
"No its fine, all we need to do is get rid of CJ, get a 6'5""+ wing who can score and play defense like Jimmy Butler, get Zach Collins back fully healthy with no ill effects from his injuries, have Simmons make a leap as the back up PG, get a defensive PF to replace Melo off the bench, find a decent two-way center to back-up Nurkic who can also spread the floor for the bench unit, and get a defensive minded, big name coach to replace Stotts. And then gel in a couple of off-season months and run it back next year. I don't know why everyone is making this so complicated."
"We traded two firsts for RoCo, so I think that we only have one first in the next five years that we're even able to trade. You'd need to flip CJ for another guy who has a big contract, but isn't in a good fit. People were bringing up Tobias Harris but he seems to be working in Philly recently.   Honestly, I was hoping CJ would light it up in a few of the recent games so that his trade value would increase going into the summer but it didn't happen. Zach Collins is always injured and Anfernee Simons was given a few chances to really break into the team but never really earned it.   We almost need to get lucky next year with Ant or Nas Little lighting it up for a few months to create a young guy with value, then swap them for somebody who fits better."
"Yeah I'd be really sad if he asked to leave, but I wouldn't be mad at him I'd be mad at the organization for not getting him the support.   The hard thing is that it's a small market, so we're not getting superstars coming here to make a super team on their own. We had to sign CJ for a ton in order to keep him since it's hard to get guys of his caliber, but he's not a great fit next to Dame. At this stage, we don't have a ton of trade assets and don't have many picks to trade since we've already traded them away.   We have to make big changes and I think we will, but I don't really see how we make big moves to make a run at the chip with what we have available. If you go back to the beginning of the season everyone on our sub thought that our team was stacked with RoCo, DJJ, Zach Collins, GTJ, Ant, etc. but it just wasn't enough. Dame needs a better #2 than CJ but I just don't know how we get it."
"Simons might help them move up in a draft, Cov probably nets you a reasonably decent first, everybody else is worth near or less than the value of their contract.  They might find a partner who thinks Zach Collins is gonna put it together but I wouldn't bet on it."
"Oof. I'm a Raptors fan and I love DeMar, but he's not the guy you guys need to help that defense.  I think Harrison Barnes might be the best fit. Get Zach Collins back. See what happens."
"If this season finally proved anything, it's that Zach Collins isn't going to happen. And frankly Nurk too. Those two combined have missed probably close to 350 games over the past 3 years, and IDK Nurk looked like a deeply flawed player with how Jokic was getting in his head. I love the dude, but we need to shake up our frontcourt in a major way."
"Although he didn't have the same weight behind him, Zach Collins kind of filled that roll in the beginning of us having Nurk. He really brought energy to our defense when he was on the floor. I feel like if he fills out a bit more as he recovers from his injury, he could be a really good asset."
"yo fuck that guy. Dame will be a blazer for a long time, especially after stotts is gone this offseason. that said, it will be hard to move CJ for actual assets, and norm is a RFA. Interested in seeing what your FO does... I hope its not just a video on how Zach Collins is the missing piece... yet again"
True true. I'm sure it would help everyone if Zach Collins wasn't injured all the time. He seems like a true PF/ back up center.  It will be interesting to see what happens to Nurk though
Are you referring to Zach Collins here or what? Other than him the team was fine.
Anyone else just fucking hate Zach Collins?
"he won't leave, it's not up to him. but he could be traded if Portland finds a Nurk/CJ trade that makes sense. We'd have to start Zach Collins (which I'd be in favor of over signing some scrub TPMLE big out of FA tbh)"
"Zach Collins, he’s got bricks for hands"
"I think we are a good team, but this is more bout the blazers. When ur fully healthy u can't lose this series, cos it clearly shows ur ceiling as a 1st round exit (I mean I'm not including zach Collins) . This on paper was the biggest back court disparity in all the play offs. U hv to make drastic changes, ur less than the sum of ur parts"
"CJ, Anfernee, Mid Level Exception Zach Collins, and all of our picks for the next decade for Brad Beal."
"you really are a casual lol. making me laugh way too much, so thanks for that.  just in case you're not trolling and really are stupid in the head, lemme break it down for you: Murray is Denver's 2nd best player, Barton is a starter and Dozier is a valuable rotation piece. Portland only has one player injured and that is Zach Collins.  good day."
Gotta feel for Zach Collins man. He doesn’t deserve this
Zach “Street Clothes” Collins
" Is it just me or is Zach Collins always injured for the Blazers come playoff time? Like everytime I watch a Blazers playoff game, he’s always in street clothes"
Zach Collins sighting! Will he ever see the floor again???
"Shout out to the Blazer fans legitimately arguing with me that Zach Collins being out negates Jamal Murray being out. If anything, it negates 40% Dozier"
Zach Collins
Seriously anyone know the situation with Zach Collins? Dude ain’t played in like 3 years?
Zach Collins ghost
Oh yeah Zach Collins exists lmao
"Zach Collins out here looking like ""if they can say it, why can't I?!"""
Zach Collins looks like a metrosexual vampire
Zach Collins is a taller TJ McConnell
"Until now, I forgot that Zach Collins was an NBA player.. That was until I saw him in the camera shot of Nurk on the sideline."
Will Zach Collins ever play again?
The real “Street Clothes” is Zach Collins. Man has been in a suit for the last two years
Why is Zach Collins always injured
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
You mean Zach Collins? Lmao
"You guys probably could've had Kawhi for McCollum, Zach Collins, and a first or two."
"Durant, Harden and two 1st round picks for Lillard, Covington, Powell, Kanter and Zach Collins"
"Injured forward Zach Collins yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Carmelo Anthony gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard CJ McCollum yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Lillard watched his team mates hit the backboard repeatedly, current NBA great Austin Rivers stood back with no hands and said, “Y’all ain’t making for shit.”"
Zach Collins is Porzingis at home. Except Zach Collins used to be better in the post too.
Blazers need to add Zach Collins and a 1st for us to even pick up the phone.
"Not too late for them to get in on Dame either. And in both the Harden or Dame sweepstakes I wouldve/am still willing to offer Ingram.   There was just a level of [delusion back then](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/12/17/22178792/james-harden-trades-proposals-76ers-celtics-raptors-blazers-heat) with these Harden trade ideas that even for homer fans standards was absurd.   &gt;Framework of the deal: Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker + 3-4 first round picks to Houston for Harden.  And the Pelicans writer said no in response to this offer!   Heres another one   &gt;Framework of the deal: C.J. McCollum and Zach Collins + a couple first round picks to Houston for Harden.  &gt;""Giving up CJ McCollum, Zach Collins, and picks is a big ask from Portland’s perspective. As things stand, I wouldn’t give up a single player from the roster in exchange for Harden, let alone two key players and two first round picks""  Do people even hear themselves when they talk, this was an actual sentence someone said like 6 months ago."
"Hope other teams rack with injuries, and other teams are desperate to trade with Portland. That CJ contract is bad contract, and Blazers don't have trade assets. Unless there team out there who want Nassir Little, Anfernee Simons, and injured Zach Collins."
"It's crazy that Zach Collins won MVP, DPOY and FMVP all in the same year. I'm so glad Neil Olshey picked him over that bum that Dame wanted us to draft, I think his name was Donovan Mitchell or something."
"Blazer legend Zach Collins. I respect you for putting him on this list, however he is far better then anyone here."
"I know you prolly mean John Collins, but I wouldn't be surprised if they gamble on Zach Collins"
Vecenie is completely off the mark in the entire article. He also suggest the Pels should pay Caruso $25 million over 3 years and should go for Zach Collins
Honestly the biggest issue is zach Collins injuries causing depth problems at center and power forward for the last two years. The team has been scrambling to fill that hole. Team defense has been an issue for years and he was supposed to help take us from last in the league to middle of the pack.   Roco was supposed to play sf instead of pf. Nurk healthy zach and roco is an acceptable defense.  Because of the lack of depth we had to play calmello at center during the playoffs
"Well, Blazers had a chance to draft Donovan, and indeed Dame name dropped Donovan as a player he liked before the draft. Blazers traded up to select Zach Collins instead."
"Zach Collins and Anfernee Simmons aren't the greatest prospects alive? Huh, I was duped 2 years ago then."
"You have Norman Powell and CJ McCollum in case you are well defended, speaking of defense you have Zach Collins Robert Covington AND Derrick Jones Jr defending. And a great Center in Nurkic and an excellent rebounder in Enes the Big Penis Kanter."
"willingness is one thing, but it doesn't exactly feel like they can even get ""deep"" into luxury tax in the upcoming season, exactly?  like, they're over the cap with 9 players (assuming norm and derrick jones jr opt in), $127M.  then they, i guess, re-sign zach collins and, i dunno, enes kanter for whatever they're worth, use the MLE and maybe the bi-annual and then vet mins for the rest, that still doesn't seem like a lot.  the cap hold for zach is $16M for spotrac, does that seem right?  kanter is like $6M, everyone else is small.  like maybe next year they could demonstrate that they're willing to spend on whoever is deserving, but not sure how much they've upgraded the roster by then or how dame will feel a year later, depending how they've done.  (unless they manage some S&amp;T with their FAs that gets them someone useful, i guess, but base year compensation still means that contract isn't too huge because it's not counted by the outgoing FAs new contract.)"
"His injuries have been freak accidents. They're not really the same as say zach collins who constantly gets non contact injuries. Plus, Nurk's healthy now so no reason to toss out a well above average center for no real replacement."
"What are his major failings?  Portland is usually picking late in the draft so it's hard to improve that.  The only pick that he super-whiffed was Zach Collins and at the time it didn't seem like an awful pick.  Sticking with CJ?  Maybe, but what are you realistically getting for CJ that puts Portland into title contention?"
Zach Collins over Bam Adebayo is the 2017 pick that really killed us.
"Zach Collins, Covington, Melo, TJ Leaf, Nassir Little, and Rondae-Hollis Jefferson aren’t enough.  They need Porzingis."
"Counteroffer, all the warriors starters, Kerr, and picks to Portland, lillard and Zach Collins to gsw, Portland moves to Seattle."
I’ll never agree with that Zach Collins pick
"Its not terrible tbh, but too mediocre to win a championship.  The 3 big issues are the 2016 offseason, the 2017 draft, and the general inability to bring in a starting-worthy small forward.    2016- tons of money thrown at Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner, which was a complete waste.  2017 draft- the bigger issue isn't that he drafted Collins, but that he traded the 15 and the 20 to get him at 10.  It wasn't even clear that we needed to trade up for him.  If you also look at who else was available, whether at 10, 15, or 20, the potential Portland team is just so much better.  Also, at 26 he took Swanigan.  3 of the next 4 picks were White, Kuzma, and Hart.  This Portland team *could* have had Mitchell or Bam, or John Collins AND OG/Jerrett Allen AND Derrick White.  Instead we've got broken Zach Collins and the ghost of Swanigan.  Forwards- Since Batum and LMA left, the ONLY starter quality forward we've had is RoCo.  We've had solid bench-quality forwards like Harkless, Aminu, DJJ, and Melo, but we've never had a real 5 man lineup."
I mean they’re gonna expect a heavy load to come their way so they do win something for a player who will never win it by himself.   Did the blazers fuck up? Sure but they can hopefully capitalize by trading Dame for a haul of future picks. NOLA looks good for the future and Rockets are just owned by a cheap asshole. Blazers just need to make sure they do well with their picks (cough mj and kd misses and then Zach collins…)
"Zach Collins, and Caleb Swanagin. One can't stay healthy, one is already out of the league."
"Definitely aren't *terrible*.  I would say as a org as a whole they've done pretty damn good.  Longest playoff streak, consistently good and fun to watch for a decade.  But have seriously dropped the ball in the last few years turning into a contender.  I think Dame carrying us to the playoffs the year we lost 4/5 starters and Aldridge for ntohing screwed us.  As welll as the Zach Collins draft and a few other moves"
"At 10 they could have picked Donovan Mitchell or Bam, at 15 they could have taken John Collins, at 20 they could have taken Jarrett Allen or OG.  Fuck they could have gotten Kuzma at 26, at least he's still in the league.  Also could have just traded 15, 20, 26, and CJ for Paul George, that's absolutely a better looking package than Oladipo and Sabonis at that time.  Instead they got one player who has almost never played in Zach Collins and another that's already out of the league in Caleb Swanigan."
"We had tons of assets and got nothing from them  We had 3 firsts in one of the best drafts in recent years and came out with swanigan and Zach Collins. Could've had John Collins, OG anunoby, Jarrett Allen, etc.   Or flipped those assets and future picks for a star"
Zach Collins.  He'll flip off the whole Nuggets Bench without getting any punishment.
&gt; We weren’t fully healthy  Zach Collins?
"I always felt that a condition of the trade from Portland's end would be moving on from nurkic to a more athletic center, allowing them to play a more aggressive scheme defensively.  They would need their 5 man to either be a lob threat or a stretch 5. Nerlens Noel would fit quite nicely provided Portland could also find some extra scoring in the backcourt, from either Simons or another floor spacing guard of a similar type. I think there's also hope that Zach Collins could be an ideal fit next to Simmons, but his injury history is really stacking up.  It's hard to project what Ben could do in a Dray role because he's never played on a team with a guard that demanded attention like Dame. People are very low on him now but it wouldn't take a ton of improvement for him to absolutely dominate the 4v3 situations that Dame generates."
"John Collins- Hawks, they’ll likely match whatever, and it’s better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he’s in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that’s even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I’ll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
"Zach Collins got Injured again, I don't think he is going to get a good deal, rest in piece to the man Injuries and Injuries killed his dream of being a NBA player who plays more then 2 healthy seasons."
"John Collins - ATL  Lonzo - S&amp;T to CHI  Markkanen - no clue honestly... I'm gonna say S&amp;T to BOS  Frank N - OKC (seems like a Presti type prospect)  Monk - CHA  Zach Collins - POR   Allen - Cleveland if they draft a guard, if they get Mobley i'm gonna say somewhere random like Washington S&amp;T  Hart - NOLA"
"Newsmax and Tucker Carlson did try to tell us it was actually BLM and Antifa behind the 1/6 attack, so maybe Zach Collins was there after all!"
"I don't respect anyone on that team but Dame, CJ, and Powell. Zach Collins is a colossal shithead that needs to be asked where he was on January 6th.   And don't worry, [we're even now.](https://i.imgur.com/Yi2hRn1.png) The Blazers are an imploding organization and the Nuggets are on a championship trajectory. Things aren't so bad."
"I like this trade personally. I'd swap out Collins for Little, though. No one wants Zach. He's also not currently under contract."
"I actually think Nas is going to do well under Chauncey. I'm really excited to watch him this year. Instead of Ant or Nas, can I perhaps interest you in one slightly used Zach Collins?"
Ben to Portland for Cj and Zach Collins
"Welcome to the plight of Zach Collins. The lanky cripple went from being rookie treatment to being too surprisingly athletic because nobody rated him after his injury. When he played, once a game or more, he would get a foul because refs just refused to believe he could get to a spot and get all ball."
"As a Blazers fan I love this trade! Only could we replace the part that says ""Blazers superstar Damian Lillard"" with ""Blazers LEGEND (Cooler than superstar) Zach Collins""?"

Not the GOAT skin in my book  2016: too lazy to develop the game  2018: didn’t get 500k viewers on twitch playing with drake  2020: blue-haired Zach Collins picked first  2021: sent in a completely different guy for mocap
"We need to trade our pick, are clown(gm neil olshey) will pick another zach collins."
"I really have to wonder how much of that is due to Oden and how much is because of Portland's medical staff (or ""curse"" for their big men, take your pick). Were Bill Walton, Sam Bowie, Arvydas Sabonis, Greg Oden and Zach Collins all destined to be fragile, injury prone players, or is there some Blazer element there tying them all together in some way?"
Poor Zach Collins    :(
"You have summoned the Blazers! Oh its bad knees, and injured centers. Hurry back Zach Collins!"
"Bagley is like an expensive Zach Collins, but with attitude issues."

Zach Collins for MBIII!
"&gt;	Zach Collins as the lottery pick  &gt;	Trading away Gary Trent Jr  &gt;	Traded 2021 pick to Houston   &gt;	Only young people on the team are Anfernee Simons (good), Nassir Little (eh) and CJ Elleby (no)  If the Blazers don’t win it then we’re not going to have a good time"
Then on the other hand we have Zach Collins lmao. Seeing him and Murray beefing during games was hilarious bc they could not be further apart as players. Collins trying to pick a fight with Jamal is about half a step past a fan trying to.
"It's easy to say all this in hindsight. No one knew that Nurkic would still be struggling with injuries 2 years later. Same with Zach Collins and CJ injuries.  You can make big changes and underperform too. E.g. 76ers losing butler, trading for Richardson, signing Harris to a max."
Why does Zach collins always get brought up like he moves the needle? He was a back up big even without injuries.
Well if Collins or Capela becomes like Zach Collins and Nurkic who are always injured then probably.
"D Rose would be a great addition for about 6-8 mil, they’d still have enough money for a 3rd big to backup Capella and Okungwu. maybe Theis or Noel (if they can afford it) or take a chance on a Zach Collins rehab project"
I’ve been screaming into the void about it since he went into the 2017 draft with 3 picks and came out with Zach Collins and Caleb Swannigan
" * Coach Nate McMillan leaves for House Hawks and is on the brink of being eliminated from the Eastern Finals.  * House Suns wins the West for the first time since 1993.  * New fevers spread across the west.  The Reggie Jackson fever and the Deandre Ayton fever.  Khwai fever hasn't been cured.  * House pistons win the Lottery.   * The blazers house chapter:   Blazers obtain Norman Powell at the cost of Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr.  House Blazers gets eliminated and Coach Stotts gets banished after a long tenure.  Chauncey Billups of house Clippers takes Stotts place as a controversial hire.   Zach Collins reinjured his ankle and is still unable to contribute to the team.  Teams are in belief that Blazers might not be far away from blowing up and are sending messengers.  House Blazers are getting messages from house 76ers, and house Celtics about blowing up the team (Dame, CJ, Norman Powell)."
"https://videorulebook.nba.com/archive/ball-ruled-out-of-bounds-missed-shot-gets-over-top-of-the-backboard/  &gt; “This is an example of a missed field goal attempt that results in a turnover. The offensive player, Zach Collins, attempts a three-point field goal, and the ball hits the rim and bounces high, and goes up and over the top of the backboard. Anytime the ball goes over the top of the backboard, it is considered to be out of bounds, and it results in a turnover.”"
Lebron to Portland for Zach Collins
moe harkless/zach collins on AD vs jrue holiday on damian lillard. They dont even matchup so its not “completely outplaying”
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
Zach Collins was already injured as well. It's not like he fractured his foot in a playoff game or something
aaaand blazers which didn't had an injury (zach collins is pretty much dead) messed up anyway. great
They play more minutes   Plus when role players get injured it doesn’t really make the news   Zach Collins had ankle surgery yesterday and it isn’t a big deal for most fans
Didn’t Zach Collins just break his foot again?
"Holy shit, [Zach Collins](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/29/trail-blazers-zach-collins-undergoes-yet-another-ankle-surgery/amp/) just broke his fucking foot again."
Because it's Zach Collins I read this as he realised he had healed and intentionally re-fractured his foot
You're forgetting Zach Collins. The 🐐
"As a Gamecocks fan, fuck Zach Collins."
it really hurts me that the blazers had no significant injuries (don’t no one say zach collins) and they still lost in the first round against an injured team who got swept in the next series. fuck dude
The average playoff team is down a Zach Collins type or better in any given series. Gotta draw the line somewhere here.
We have our own Zach Collins to cry to
zach collins broke his foot again. obviously lebron was right.
Zach Collins' signature shoe: A walking boot
Zach Collins?
I think the Lakers and Warriors would be nuts not to go after Zach Collins.
What do Zach Collins and Greg Oden have in common? Way too much if ur a blazers fan.
Zach Collins can be healthy for 41 games
&gt; 3rd foot  Zach “Tripod” Collins
"Ah yes, Zach Collins, known to frequent Portland’s own OHSU hospital. I heard he plays basketball on the side, but no one’s ever been able to confirm that."
Justin Patton played a grand total of 49 minutes in his first 3 seasons.   Zach Collins played 66 games in his first season alone. He's got a much bigger body of work that would lead someone to take a chance on him.
"He reminds me more of the ""my leg"" guy. You never see it, but you know zach collins is somewhere grabbing his leg in pain"
Zach Collins is the sacrificial anode on our team.....we have to resign him or something worse will hit our roster
"MRI Stoudamire, Web Embiid, Anthony DaytoDavis, CP3-5 days move aside  We got Zach Collins on a tear here"
"&gt;Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. Every night, I lie  awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.  \- Zach Collins"
"The curse goes extra hard for white bigs specifically. Walton, Sabonis, Zach Collins. Nurk has dealt with his fair share too"
"A lot has happened since 2016. Yes, we got Nurkic, but he has only been 100% healthy in the playoffs part of the time. Zach Collins has been in the same boat (he’s also a first rd pick we traded UP for dammit). Until this season the non-Dame/CJ/Nurk roster was pretty suspect aside from Covington and Hood and even Hood had a rough time coming back from a torn achilles (he was also traded with youthful talent for Powell). This roster, when fully healthy, hasn’t managed to be on the floor all together and show its full potential, but I’m not giving Olshey a pass for that. There’s been plenty of roster turnover, but hardly any of it left a single person thinking ‘This team can compete for a title’.  Oh yeah, and don’t get me started on how much dead money Olshey has saddled this team with. That ALONE should be grounds for his dismissal."
"It would have to be in a trade bc I doubt any FA will want to come. But realistically trade CJ for a decent player that isn’t 6’3”, resign Norm, try to get a back up center that is better on defense rather than offense, and then pray Nurk and hopefully Zach Collins can stay healthy  That’s just a start but a couple more moves here and there and we’d be leaps and bounds better than we were. We had talent, it was fit, effort, and coaching that was the problem."
"I haven't seen a lot of talk to that level despite Celtics fans looking at Rob with rose colored glasses on.  And while C's fans are enthusiastic about their young guys, they're no better or worse than any other fanbase on r/nba.  Lakers flairs were adamant that Kuzma was much better than Jayson Tatum.  Sixers fans were still holding out hope that Ben Simmons, who has added nothing to his game offensively in 4 years in the NBA, will magically turn a corner.  Blazer fans are especially precious, they think that Zach Collins is dripping with upside and the answer to their roster flaws despite the fact that he's played 11 games in the last 2 years.  The Celtics fans pound the table for the Jays, but that's because they're both actually really good."
Giannis for CJ and Zach Collins
"Except for Zach Collins, the Blazers were completely healthy in these playoffs."
Zach Collins has entered the chat
Zach Collins is going to break out any second now.
"Heat GM here.  Willing to give up Butler, Herro and Achiuwa for Dame and Zach Collins.  Call me crazy but I think Dame and Adebayo can win it all."
"What if, what if, what if.  What if Zach Collins didn't keep getting injured? Then it would have been seen as a great move.  What if they kept their #15 and #20 and missed on both?  What if they grabbed Donovan Mitchell instead of Zach Collins?  It is pointless to look at moves down the road in hindsight. There will almost always be better moves for you to do, players who do better than their draft position."
To be fair blazers fans have thought they could get pretty much anyone with Ant Simons and Zach Collins the last couple of years lol
Trading up for Zach Collins is what fucked them over when they could have stayed with #15 and #20 and taken both John Collins and OG Anunoby
"i actually really like this past season’s roster *when* it looked like Zach Collins would be available. then injuries, lack of growth from some players and going all in on the three guard lineup made me sour a bit. NO has had a bit of bad luck in his career but his missteps outweigh those instances.   it might be in the best interest of the franchise if jody allen sold it to someone who’s more interested and they tank and rebuild. repeater tax will hit this next season if they build any sort of roster that hopes to contend outside of the four they have locked in at nearly 110 million, they’ll most likely have to go over the cap to do this and it only stacks year after year.   NO has put himself in a corner after shoving most of his chips onto the table for last year’s squad."
"Sabonis and something (13th pick, Jeremy Lamb &amp; Holiday Bros, ect.) for Dame &amp; maybe something (Zach Collins, future pick, ect.)."
It's Zach Collins team now 🤷‍♂️
"I can’t believe that there are still some people who are hyped about Melo. The dude made bad career decisions. There was a point when he himself admitted that he didn’t get in shape. Sometimes, I think (of course not serious) his bad luck is bringing all those injuries to Zach Collins and Nurkic."
I would have thought their missing piece was Zach Collins
What the fuck actually happened to Zach Collins? Man never plays anymore seems like
"Are there rules by trying to spell in the lowest number of players possible? Otherwise you could do something like this..or even more ridiculous   Pels  zach lavi**NE**  zion **W**illiamson  &amp;#x200B;  paul ge**OR**ge  **LE**bron james  dami**AN** lillard  **S**teph curry  &amp;#x200B;  giannis antetokoum**P**o  jo**EL** embiid  luka donc**I**c  pas**CA**l siakam  john colli**NS**  &amp;#x200B;  PG: Steph, D-Lil  SG: Luka, Lavine  SF: Lebron, PG13  PF: Giannis, Zion, Siakam  C: Embiid, Collins"
"PG: De'Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: Paul George (AS), Zach Lavine (AS), Marcus Smart  SF: Kawhi Leonard (SS), Nicholas Batum, Jae Crowder  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (SS), John Collins  C: Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka"
Zach Collins when healthy
"Larry Nance is just Zach Collins' peak, we got there the hard way but we got there."
No mention of losing Zach Collins for 2 years+ basically?
"It's a shame Zach Collins never stayed healthy, I thought his hard nosed and physical defense was something the Blazers really could have used the last couple seasons.  The Blazers have their ""big 3"" and that's enough for a playoff spot with any kind of decent roster around them. I feel like they needed more positive defenders and help defenders to improve their poor defense.   I think they will be a better team this year but I also don't think that is going to be enough to get them a finals berth unless they get a lot of luck."
A lot of people don't seem to realize how much Zach Collins' injuries screwed things up. He's a mobile big and excellent rim protector who could've played next to Kanter or Melo. This would've covered up a lot of their deficiencies instead of having them amplified by playing together. He also would've been another option at the 5 when Nurk went down. Injuries to key personnel really exacerbated our defensive issues last year.
"there was (is?) a segment of Blazer fans who thought Zach Collins &gt; John Collins and would not listen to reason on the subject.  Also the Lakers &amp; Nets flair are pretty horrid, but then again so are lots of Celtics flair.  Really every team &amp; player has asshole fans/supporters, there are 4M r/nba subs and we skew heavily toward the nephew demo.  The only fanbase that doesn't get all up in arms are the Suns, but maybe that's just because I think Devin Booker is as good as they do..."
"i never said he was the source of our cap problems? due to his stature as a player, we were forced to play him 20+ minutes a night even if it meant playing next to Kanter (because Zach Collins got re-injured to start the season).   The Lakers will have the same problem next year. Having a vet min Melo hurts more than he helps. His stature requires he plays 20+ minutes a night, and better defensive front court players are kept on the bench because of it"
"Zach Collins is down to brawl. Too bad about the whole ""being good at basketball"" part."
"Is there something bad about gaining Larry Nance Jr, Cody Zeller, Snell, McClemore to the bench and getting rid of Kanter, Melo, Harry Giles, and Zach Collins (who wasn't going to play this year because he broke his ankle for the third time in a row)?  That's an obvious upgrade?   The starting lineup wasn't the problem last year and had a top 5 net rating in the league?  The bench was god awful and has been completely overhauled with players that aren't defense deficient?"
Lol Zach Collins for Justin Jackson and Harry Giles was such a lose-lose draft day trade
"Piggybacking on this, does anyone know how his injury compares to Zach Collins’?"
"yeah and the Blazers are very short on their quotient of chronically injured players now that Zach Collins is gone, so Exum would really be a nice fit in that regard"
"Mikal Bridges was at the wedding. He a perfect starting 3 for this squad.   The second team is solid too with CJ, Simons, Layman, DeRozan, Zach Collins (who is obviously healthy on this magical all wedding team)"
"Your starters through 6 man (CJ) are good.  Gotta fill out some depth with the other NBA players though.  You'd want Jake Layman, Mo Harkless, Delon Wright, and Meyers Leonard added.  Those can join along with your idea of Simons and Collins (if healthy) filling out the depth.  After that you get some less playable guys, maybe Evan Turner and Ed Davis.  That gives you a 14 man roster.    Insane guard rotation with Dame, CJ, and Beal.  Your forwards are spottier.  Derozan played PF this last season, but you'd have to fit him and Draymond into the starting lineup.  Jake Layman is a respectable bench SF.  Maybe Wright can get some sf minutes?  Zach Collins (if we pretend he's magically healthy) can back-up at the 4 and 5, then you have Harkless at the 4, though he hasn't looked good since leaving Portland.  At the 5, you have Collins, then Leonard, and a 'break in case of emergency' sub in Ed Davis.  I think that's actually not the worst 14-man roster.  Solid team.  Too many question marks for me, such as the starting line-up having some spacing issues, being weak at SF, and having several questionable NBA players.  ET hasn't played in a couple years.  Edit: I say weak at SF under the assumption Derozan would be playing like a PF still, even if he's in the starting lineup as a SF"
No it’s Zach Collins and Anfrenee Simons
Zach Collins
He’s what Zach Collins might have been
"I can’t argue against that because the Spurs definitely have a “type” of player that they go for. But it definitely seems like pop is someone whose high on Simmons simply based on a quote he had from last season;   &gt; “It would enhance his game, obviously. That can’t be argued with. But all of his physical skills, basketball skills, the way he understands the game, as unselfish as he is — he’s so elite already, who gives a damn if he can’t shoot.”  I would be straight up lying to you if I said Simmons was a perfect Spurs type player, but at the same time there have been players in that organization and guys they’ve gone after that weren’t exactly that either. Some notable guys being Stephen Jackson, Bruce Bowen, and Richard Jefferson. When talking about guys they tried to get they almost signed Marcus Morris like a year ago, they tried to trade for Kyrie when he was in CLE and almost signed Jason Kidd back in the 2000’s. This is kind of nitpicking but you could even argue guys Parker, Murray and DeRozan don’t fit that to a tee based on their past or off court actions. I think at the end of the day assuming Ben isn’t some James Harden level party animal with a Stephen Jackson level egotistical mindset he could be in a Spurs jersey because talent and on-court play fixes everything.   On top of that I think it’s pretty well documented that San Antonio isn’t afraid to do weird shit or take on Project players it was on display this offseason with them taking Josh Primo in the lottery and paying Zach Collins despite his injuries"
I might put Josh Jackson over Zach Collins cuz he actually plays but that's not saying much
"Jesus fuck no one's contesting how good Demar is.  DeRozan is 32 is on the decline. The players they would get from LA are young, on the same timeline as Murray, and on the rise. Ingram is the clear cut star, Hart would be a great 3 and D for them. Lonzo and Kuzma might just be trade pieces.   Point is that Pop chose to fuck the Lakers over in favor of short term gains...a gamble that didn't even pay off because they were a fringe playoff team at best.  If they chose the Lakers package those players are either gonna fit Pop's long-term views or be great trade pieces.  Now DeRozan, Aldridge, Mills, and Gay are gone and the Spurs got McBuckets and Zach Collins? Lmao."
"Stotts* develops players well. He would get consistently shit on for not playing rookies or sophomores but there’s something to be said for making young guys understand their minutes are not a give in and if they want to play they better take notes from the vets ahead of them. Barring injuries like Zach Collins, Stotts had an incredible way of pulling the most out of young guys no one else really looked twice at."
"the concern is if their young core plateaus in development and they turn out to be good role players instead of a second star next to trae young. You need at least 2 stars to compete in the league. Blazers over committed to a flawed dame and cj core while overvaluing anfernee simons and zach collins, both of who now has no trade value. Celtics chest of first round picks ainge refused to trade for stars turned out to be mediocre role players like grant williams, semi, and langford."
It looks like 15 active players and 2 inactive players can be on a roster. Zach Collins will be inactive for the coming year I believe. But not sure if they already have a second inactive player.
"Problem is that Saric is a perfect salary match along with Smith for Thad. Otherwise, the Suns would be absorbing $10M-ish, which they could not do.   Essentially, the Spurs would have to hold out for a first to absorb Saric's salary - basically paying $18M for a FRP....I don't know if that's a good value anyway, considering it will likely be way down in the 20's. They would REALLY have to believe in Smith to make this deal. And after all of that, they'd still have to cut (probably) Eubanks (along with Aminu and Hutchinson) to get down to 15.   They are already going to be eating $15M from those 2. It starts to get ugly the more you think about it. At least Aminu and Hutch come off the books after this season but adding Saric and his 2 years would be a very risky move. They also have Zach Collins who is holding down a roster spot to rehab all season as well.   All of this is pointing to the Spurs maybe looking at making a bigger deal but not sure for who?"
Zach Collins.
Except Rodney McGruder and Zach Collins
"&gt; They had max slot and there were some young, reclamation projects out there  Like who lol? Lauri Markkanen was basically the only one besides Zach Collins who we signed. And given that the cavs gave up a first to get Markkanen, we would've lost out on a first if we got him plus Thad Young who we are also trying to flip for another asset.  John Collins is basically the only other guy that was available and to get him we wouldn't have been able to sign and trade DeMar and we would have had to give him a max."
People are confusing their signings with bad contracts. Were the Doug McDermott and especially Zach Collins signings a bit...random? Sure. Were their contracts bad? Definitely not.
"if Zach Collins had actually sniffed the ceiling the Blazers hive held out hope for, the Blazers would've been significantly more dangerous during the last 3 years."
"Ah yes, why pay Lauri when you can overpay Zach fucking Collins"
Uhh Zach Collins and his bum ankle signed with the Spurs like 2 weeks ago. San Antonio gave him 3 years 22 million even.
Don’t apologize I’m trolling but if they can get Zach Collins back and get a full season from Nurkić in addition to bringing in Nance it could help their defense tremendously. Remember this is a ball club that was giving big minutes to lineups with both Carmelo and Enes Kanter on the floor together. That said they are not a championship threat regardless so that is definitely true. Dame probably ends up in Philly at the deadline.
Woah they actually look similar :o Zach Collins and Kevin Love are the best answers so far!
[Zach Collins](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTFKXZdxmzeKdqBopUe2GYmONMiLYTFY32yYA&amp;usqp=CAU) kind of looks like a younger [Max Kellerman](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSD4PPAxxfhdyRUp6ZnDwJ3jOTX5omrPtasdg&amp;usqp=CAU) or maybe a little brother.
"Well firstly it is hard to make big moves as a small market GM, and the only big ticket player you can trade is CJ.  Secondly, 2016 aside, Neil has literally not overpaid anyone since. CJ I guess, but he is better than ""mediocre"". Nurk, RoCo, Powell, and now Nance are all on good contracts. He even let Zach Collins walk instead of giving him as much money as the Spurs did."
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
"Zach Collins over RJ Barrett? Bruh, come on"
you put zach collins really high
Klay is so chill.  I remember a Warriors-Blazers game a few years ago where Zach Collins really pissed Klay off to the point that Klay was really yapping at him on court. I wonder what he said lol
Aah man don't remind me of that series. But what a hard fought back and forth series that was  Not throwing shade but didn't you guys get knocked out by the blazers next round? Coz from what I remember Zach Collins played well in that series especially game 6 and 7 to knock you guys out. Excited to have him in our team this season!!
"RFA.  Either is going to stay with the Bulls on a 1-year deal and eventually get moved  OR  Sign the MLE with a team that wants him.   However of course he is wanting big money but there are no teams that can sign him for what he wants. The guy ruined his chances just like how Schroder ruined his.  At this rate he's best off going to a team that's going to give him PT. Spurs would be a good destination, especially since they are rebuilding and have a need for a PF with upside. I know they've got Zach Collins, but that guy is a walking injury just waiting to happen. Only appeared in 11 games in the Covid season, didn't play at all last year. Thaddeus Young might be on the move eventually and Samanic isn't exactly good enough for regular minutes."
Will Barton for Afflalo. Also trading up for Zach Collins (our 2 1sts)
- Believing in Thon Maker - LaMelo would be a bust - Always believing that Zach Collins will stay healthy
It was Zach Collins. Lol
"My theory is Olshey thinks he has a 'gut feeling' for players.  There was a story about why we drafted Zach Collins so high (and traded multiple picks to move up for that reach), where he saw a game of Collins where he made an impressive play and Olshey 'knew' we wanted him.  My conspiracy is he sees one great thing in a player and goes with it.  Then it's just a question of if they develop."
"dont understand why spurs didnt sign him and signed aminu and thad young who wont even get court time for the same money, oh and zach collins, wtf"
"Pretty reliable 3-point shooter for a 7-footer, but one of the most injury prone players I’ve come across.  It amazes me that Portland picked both him and Zach Collins with their first round picks as bigs to put around Dame: what shit luck."
Zach Collins got whistled for SO many moving picks. It was infuriating.
Jeff Teague. Punchable face I guess idk.  I also don't like Zach Collins. Same sort of thing.
Was probably Zach Collins
"Brogdon, Zach Collins, Oladipo, Zinger, Zion is trending that way"
"Zach Collins and his twin, Jonathan Isaac."
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
You can't know if a dude is going to get unlucky with injuries. Zach Collins was playing well right before he dealt with all those injuries. Good rim protector and versatile offensively for a role player.
&gt; im okay with the zach collins pick cause ~~when healthy he is actually good~~ my team signed him this summer  FTFY
Zach Collins when healthy is an oxymoron.
Neil will definitely be justified in trading up for Collins if Zach starts tearing it up for (checks notes) the San Antonio Spurs this season
"Both Collins had a ton of hype, felt like Zach had more hype than Stanley Johnson when we then picked Winslow."
"I'm pretty sure most of the Heat sub wanted John Collins not Zach, which would have still been a good pick. I remember him being a favorite, especially since he went to high school in South Florida."
Yeah that one haunts me. I’m still convinced Zach Collins could have been good if he stayed healthy though.
so much better options then giles and justin jackson..... im okay with the zach collins pick cause when healthy he is actually good
"Zach Collins.  Blazers traded up for him and he was pretty much a complete whiff.  Also painful considering who went after him (Donovan Mitchell, Bam, OG, John Collins, Jarrett Allen)."
"That draft will haunt my dreams forever. Portland picked Zach Collins with Bam, Mitchell, OG, John Collins, and  Jarrett Allen still on the board."
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
"Stop it bro.  What paper we talking about  Zo vs Trey - This will be a really good matchup. I think zo will make trey work in a playoff series, and a lot of factors point towards that.   He is 6’6, long, active hands, and high bb iq.  You also have a top defensive coach in Billy.  Zo has a higher 3 point percentage because Trey takes dumb shots (I say this as a huge fan of his playoff run), but I think overall Zo holds his own in terms of creating, Trey will score more but it probably won’t be on high efficiency, with Zo being far more effective on D.   Trey obviously has a bigger impact for his team, but I think Zo can win the match up in the aforementioned ways or at the very least will make it competitive.    Zach vs Bogi - Not even a discussion   Vuc/Pat vs Capella/Collins - Vuc is an allstar for a reason.  He dragged purposely bad orlando teams to the playoffs multiple seasons, and has amazing playoff numbers.  Respect to both Capella and Collins, but Vuc has been a franchise cornerstone for multiple seasons.  Pat is really just based on potential, but with what we’ve seen so far, active defense and reliable 3 point shooting (he was 40% last yr but on low attempts) will be enough to give bulls the frontcourt advantage.   He is just as athletic as Collins, and so far has shown to be just as effective of a floor spacer.  You guys will probably get us on stocks, but scoring and rebounds will probably favor our frontcourt.  Demar vs Hunter - Hunter is a much better defender.  But demar has been a key part of multiple first seed toronto teams, multiple time ecf finalist, and really his main flaw is that he couldn’t get past Lebron? He is one of the best mid range players in the game, and as you saw, in the playoffs that has been key.   He is in a reduced role with the lowest scoring load in his career after posting career best efficiency last year and stepping up his facilitating abilities.  You really think Hunter gonna get more buckets vs Demar? This one goes to the vet.   And bench wise, we lack frontcourt depth, but Coby/Caruso are going to win us the guard match up.  Galo is a good source of buckets off the bench, but odds are, with a tighter rotation in the offs, Demar is going to fill that role with our secondary and we will be staggering him and Zach.    The match up will come down to how well we contain Trey.  We don’t have the rim protection to compete with Capella/Collins if they are going crazy off of lobs and entry passes, so it will largely come down to aggressive d, playing passing lanes, which so far, seems to be exactly what this team does.   You guys have to hide Trey on defense which will be hard against a team with so many scorers and willing passers.     Scoring wise though I think its heavily in our favor, and our D so far has shown enough to be deemed competent.  So again, what paper are we talking about?"
Long term effects of Zach Collins verbal abuse.
Well Zach Collins needs a rehab buddy
"We could have drafted him twice, but instead we traded three picks to move up and draft Zach Collins."
Zach Collins
"This is pretty wild      The 10th overall pick from those years for comparison     CJ McCollum, Elfrid Payton, Thon Maker, Zach Collins, Justise Winslow, Mikal Bridges.     I would take team 27th in a heartbeat.    What's wilder is that I had to go all the way down to the 5th overall pick to find a group I would take above them (Trae+Fox), which even then is less consistent overall."
Westbrook: has to prove he can extend his range  Simmons: has to prove he's playable in 4th quarters  Zach Collins: Has to prove whatever potential we saw is still there  CJ McCollum: Has to prove he's good enough to be the second best player on a contender  Porzingis: Has to prove he's good enough to be a second best player on a contender  Rudy Gobert: Has to prove he can abuse mismatches  Zach Lavine: Has to show why he wants to be 'respected' by the Bulls  LeBron James: has to prove he wakes up before Skip Bayless to work out /S.

Zach Collins 2.0
"I like the Zach Collins take, health permitting"
"Honest guess;  Kevin Knox, Obi Toppin, Jalen Brunson, Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons"
For Mavs:  * 2016: AJ Hammon -&gt; Jake Layman (46 -&gt; 47) * 2017: Dennis Smith Jr. -&gt; Zach Collins (9 -&gt; 10) * 2018: Trae Young -&gt; Mo Bamba (5 -&gt; 6) * 2019: Deividas Sirvydis -&gt; Daniel Gafford (37 -&gt; 38) * 2020: Josh Green -&gt; Saddiq Bey (18 -&gt; 19)
"I was actually pretty pleased with our moves this offseason. We didn't make a big splash but we won't be a terrible team and we got a good first and Thad Young in a sign and trade with DeRozan. Doug McDermott is a low risk signing that will fit well with our roster. Zach Collins is a low risk signing that probably won't work out great but if it does, he'll be on a steal of a contract."
"    pg: Kyle Lowry -&gt; Rajon Rondo (2006)     sg: Duncan Robinson -&gt; Shai-Gilgeous Alexander (DR undrafted, using draft of rookie year 2018)     sf: Jimmy Butler -&gt; Kawhi Leonard (2011)     pf: PJ Tucker -&gt; LaMarcus Aldridge (2006)     c:  Bam Adebayo -&gt; Zach Collins (2017)  Feel like the only straight downgrade is Bam to Zach Collins. Spacing looks pretty rough, though."
"Why wouldn't it just be a coincidence?  It'll happen eventually. Shooting at that size is just so valuable that lots of guys can make it to the NBA at that height with shooting being their only skill  But there are bigs of that size that can pass and play defense (Nurkic). He just can't shoot. And then other guys like Zach Collins that can shoot and play defense, but not pass...or stay healthy.   Eventually someone will have all 3."
"I was hoping one of y'all would post this because what most of you view as an epic Zach LaVine highlight,  I see as an epic Eric Collins highlight 😎"
"Zach Collins, Jonathan Isaac, both guys that any team in the league would want for their bench if healthy. Both guys who are never healthy."
"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
"Let's see... Meyers Leonard, Evan Turner, Mo Harkless, Al-faruq Aminu, Wade Baldwin as the starting five..    With Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, Caleb Swanigan, and Jake Layman coming off the bench.   Basically the 2016 Blazers without Dame &amp; CJ."
I was screaming for Zach Collins to be our starting 5 that series. Or go small with Aminu/Harkless as the 4/5.
"Any contract is movable with some draft picks attached to it. A contract that takes a few picks to move is by definition a bad contract, but as long as Williams doesn't suddenly turn into Zach Collins then I think the Celtics are safe on that front.   People are always clamoring to proclaim these signings as great or awful, but the true measure of whether a guy is on a value contract or not is what you could get for him via trade on this new deal. Could Boston trade Williams and get more in return now, or would they have to sweeten the pot to get someone to take him? Right now it's probably neither, which most likely means it's a fair deal. If he takes a big step forward this year, it'll be a great value signing. If he's hurt all the time, maybe it becomes a negative value contract. It's a gamble right now and Boston is hoping it pays off. It's a solid signing."
&gt; Yeah I mean look at the bag Zach Collins just secured  Collins has less guaranteed money on his contract than Robert Williams does in a single season if this deal
Yeah I mean look at the bag Zach Collins just secured. There is always someone willing to take a chance on oft-injured talent.
"Not sure if you're using a different metric, but we had the [6th best defensive rating in 2018](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-know-about-portlands-prolific-offense-can-its-much-maligned-defense-level-up/). Either way, it destroys the narrative that Stotts ""couldn't"" be the coach of a good defensive team. Problem that year was not quite enough offense to go along with it. (Aminu, Harkless, Evan Turner, Ed Davis, and a very young Zach Collins)"

Zach Collins was picked top 10
Zach Collins
"Ben needs to come to San Antonio where we loaded up on shooters   If Zach Collins ever makes it on the court we’d be able to roll out Zach, Jacob, Luka Samanic and Ben at the same time - tallest rotation ever?"
Zach Collins if my man can stay healthy. Swear to heck the guy can hoop.
Zach Collins.
Zach Collins 3rd best player on a playoff team 🔒
"He literally played 3 series and I mentioned all of them. gsw twice, Zach Collins once hence (Zach x2). That's twice you've failed reading comprehension."
DJ will a huge leap and become a borderline all star. Zach Collins will turn out to be a steal. Vassell or Walker will take a huge leap forward leading to White getting traded for picks to a team who won’t accept they aren’t as good as they think they are in a desperate attempt to add some bench points. Keldon Johnson will average 23 3 &amp; 8 with his 3p% jumping to 38%.

I'm actually just surprised Dame hasn't demanded a trade already after the off season/free agency they just had. Man lit a fire under the Trailblazers FO's ass to get him some help and I think the biggest thing they did was re-sign Powell...Powell is great but do they think that's enough to keep Lillard happy? Is Cody Zeller *really* that missing piece? He's an upgrade over Zach Collins sure but that's not saying all that much.  They didn't have to blow their load and overpay on guys but damn man...they did nothing in this off-season that pushes them pass the first round of the playoffs.
I love that Zach Collins got included here. lol
Three HOF potential bigs and Zach Collins so far... don't get me started on Roy
I would like to bring up that Bleacher Report rated the Zach Collins move as a better deal than the DDR move
If Zach Collins were the 25th pick not the 10th pick and he had the exact same career showing the exact same “potential” he has he’d be scraping by on some minimum contract and potentially out of the league in 1-2 years
Imagine drafting Zach Collins over Bam lmfaoooo poverty franchise
top 50 players (sorted by team):  Lakers:  1). LeBron James  2). Anthony Davis  3). Russell Westbrook  Suns:   4). Devin Booker  5). Chris Paul  Nuggets:  6). Nikola Jokic  7). Jamal Murray  8).

"another thing is that isn’t a good roster build for 3 on 3, even if they are that good  pritchard yes, but you need ball handlers when you only have 3 guys. ball will be in your hands 1/3 as opposed to 1/5 of the time. PJ washington was really poor at UK as a freshman and zach collins is nice for a big, but not 3 on 3. more spacing on the court also allows your handles to flourish way more since you don’t have to worry about as much help defense. same thing with passing. both bigs are capable for bigs, but not 3 on 3  i think the perfect team for 3 on 3 ball would look like early 2010s Buzz Williams marquette teams. guys like jimmy butler, jae crowder, lazar hayward, darius johnson odom and vander blue are the perfect guys who can all rebound, pass, shoot, and guard multiple possessions on defense"
"Interestingly, Zach Collins is the player that came to mind for 3x3 Paris. If his career collapses one more time due to injury (and I wish him the best) he's the sort of big man who'd do really well in 3x3. It's all about having a diverse game, and for someone as big as him he fits the bill."
"Not that easy to just put teams together. When the FIBA 3x3 was just starting out, USA sent a 3x3 team in the 2015 FIBA U18 tournament of Payton Pritchard, PJ Washington, and Zach Collins (4 and 5 star recruits who all eventually made the NBA).   They were clearly the 3 best U18 players in the tournament (no other team had a future NBA player as of this moment). Lost multiple times and was eliminated in the QF. People underestimate the impact of team chemistry."
Or Sam bowie or Bill walton or zach Collins
Draft OG Anunoby and John Collins instead of Zach Collins.    Draft Giannis instead of CJ.
"how did we have a worse offseason lmao. we signed one of the best 9 active 3 point shooters in the league in doug mcdermott and gained 1 protected 2nd and a swap 2nd, signed a couple of solid pick ups for cheap, gave zach collins a contract to see if he can stay healthy and try to flourish, we traded an 31yrs old unrestricted free agent for one 1st, two 2nds, aminu, thad young who can be flipped for another 1st, we drafted the youngest player in the league who looks amazing (from someone who would have rather have others). hos is this worse than yours?"
Are the odds for this up in Vegas yet. I could see Malik Monk. Jaren Jackson Jr. Zach Collins. Time Lord. Kris Dunn.
"But can they stack up to our line up of McDermott, Jakob, Eubanks, Luka, and Zach Collins"
"Doug McDermott, Zach Collins, Domantas Sabonis, Drew Eubanks, Kevin Love.  They’re hard working, lunch pail type of guys, with a high basketball IQ."
Zach Collins breaking his foot walking to the mailbox.
"It isn't that hard to create cap space. They could have given Zach Collins the qualifying offer, do a three team trade involving GSW, Spurs and Blazers. Zach Collins still goes to Spurs on a three year deal, GSW gets a trade exception and Blazers get Oubre. Probably have to give a 2nd rounder but it can be done.   The question is whether Portland wanted to go deep into the tax."
His and Zach Collins’ agent are the clear winners of the off-season.
"They had a lot of injuries all season, specifically Nurk and CJ. Relatively healthy for the playoffs. Unless you count Zach Collins, but he’s been out for like 2 years anyway"
"If Zach Collins gets a 3 year deal worth 20-30 million, then so can Lauri."
"Lol true, not many stand out. Nurk was likely the most impactful one. In our WCF run trading for Hood (who was crucial that post season) and draft pick that led to GTJ were good trades and got us Powell in the long run, but remains to be seen if that really pans out for us (it probably won't if we fail to trade CJ for a wing). We traded up in the draft to get Zach Collins which was at the time seen as a good move.  So yeah. Not actually that many to speak of. Our ability in the draft has really been what has kept us afloat. And player development under Stotts, but it didn't make up for his lack of strategic ability and game management skills."
"I think you had a window but, as sad as this sounds, it was dependent on draft picks like Zach Collins becoming a foundational defender."
"Then he should've signed the offer from the Spurs that Zach Collins ended up taking! We'd rather have Thadgic than Lauri anyway. Sick of this dude, he's 7 foot tall and only plays between the 3 point lines"
"&gt;our big depth is not great  I mean, we have Doug at 4 followed by Luka. At the 5 we have Jakob and Drew. Than we have solid third string in Jock Landale and Zach Collins, if he ever becomes healthy. As a low average team that is not contending this is enough.  &gt;I don't think we'd get a 1st for him at the trade deadline  Yeah, completely agree here."
and low on gangly white guys without Zach Collins.  There's only so much Cody Zeller can do to hold up that mantle
Giannis Middleton Jrue KD Harden Kyrie Trae Lebron AD Butler Tatum Steph Klay? Randle Beal Lillard Embiid Kawhi PG CP3 Booker Jokic Derozan? Luka Zion Jaylen Brown? Sabonis? Fox? Adebayo? Ayton? Donovan Mitchell John Collins? Jamal Murray? Zach Lavine? Lowry?   That’s 25 guys if you don’t include any of the question marks. 36 including question marks that I’m not sure are better but are close at this point in his career.
"I think Zach Collins is a decent signing. If he recovers and looks like his old self, we have him on a steal of a contract for 2 years. If he doesn't, well we blew like 5% of the cap on a risk."
It should be pointed out that KOC thought the best signings this week were DeRozan and Zach Collins.
"Meyers didn't do much, Zach Collins was the one that saved us. Evan Turner had some good moments too in game 6/7 and Moe Harkless basically singlehandedly forced one of the overtimes in game 3"
"I mean he's getting less money than Zach Collins, who might not ever be healthy enough to play NBA basketball, and Kelly Olynyk, who's a fucking bum."
"If it makes you feel better, you just landed Kemba for close to what the Spurs are paying Zach Collins."
"They also lost Zach Collins and Enes Kanter, and have brought in Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, and Ben McLemore. So, they have made some other moves, as well as re-signing Powell, but the question is if these move the needle for Dame. Either way, I think he lasts there until at least the trade deadline, if not into next offseason."
"The 2023 Draft has Victor Wembanyama and Emoni Bates.   2022 Draft has Paolo Banchero and Chet Holgrem.   I'd say best to just go full-on youth movement and try to get a Top 3 pick the next two seasons.   1994: Derrick White  1995: Poetl,. Jock Landale  1996: Dejounte  1997: Zach Collins, Eubanks  1998: Lonnie  1999: Keldon  2000: Vassell, Samanic, Tre Jones"
Same with Zach Collins but we still signed him you know
"They can have lauri, their zach collins replacement"
"Lauri really stinked up the joint for everyone if he indeed turned down the offer to go to San Antonio.. I imagine it’s a better contract than whatever Zach Collins got..  Bulls could have retained Thad, Lauri could have gotten paid, Lauri could get more Playtime in an organization that embraces foreign players and development"
"Fuck all their fans that would be non stop shilling for the Zach Collins pick though, glad that shit is over"
This is you guys never go anywhere. You’re satisfied with CJ and Zach Collins.
The Blazers sealed their fate when they used 2 first round picks to trade up for Zach Collins when guys like PG and Jimmy Butler were available. The writing has been on the wall for awhile.
The entire team was healthy in the playoffs (except for Zach Collins I guess) and they lost in 6 to a crippled Nuggets team that got swept in the next round. The issue really isn’t health.
"And have added Thad Young, Aminu, McDermott, Forbes, Josh Primo, Landale and Zach Collins"
"1. I didn't change any context of any argument, I literally repeated what he said on a podcast. Excuse me for...checks notes...repeating a podcasters words? 2. I didn't call him a racist, I even said I'm not making assumptions about what his thoughts are 3. I just said he gets excited about white guys who can ball, which if you listen to Simmons regularly, its true...he points it out a lot 4. Since you clearly have a boner about context, we can agree that a *segment* celebrating *many* white players is different than a *singular* comment on a *singular* player. So your Zach Collins thing isn't exactly the same here 5. Respond to OP, not me, if you're gonna get defensive about stupid bullshit 6. If you have a hair trigger on this, I'm more inclined to call you a racist, not Bill Simmons. Bill *may* be biased (which is different than being racist), but you're clearly uncomfortable with someone pointing that out  ✌️"
"Well you changed the context of the argument to fit your point. I was still responding to the OP.   And I just went and listened to the part of the pod that's being discussed,  bill spends like 5 minutes crushing the Zach Collins signing lmao. So know I guess he hates white guys using the same logic.    It's just tiring that calling someone  racist, sexist or bigoted in anyway will always get you up votes in this sub. It's the safest thing yet people act like they are some brave ultra wokes that see through the bullshit."
"o'connor also said two of his favorite transactions were the derozan and zach collins deals, i have no idea what he is talking about"
"Zach Collins, for getting a 3 year deal after playing 11 games total (playoffs included) the last two seasons."
I missed the Zach Collins signing yesterday and lmao
"I was gonna say it was closer to fair than a great deal but then i realized Zach Collins got a similar value so yeah, pretty great deal."
"Zach ""They called me Mr. Glass"" Collins"
Oh yeah? Well we got Zach Collins!
"Getting Zach Collins was an great move for them, I imagine they are gonna rebuild and trade thad."
"It's not a premium. That's the point.   We're giving almost that much money to Zach Collins. The Nuggets are giving *more* to Will Barton. Alex Caruso is getting that kind of money. Kuzma gets more, and he's garbage.   He's getting a role player's salary, he's already proven he's a plus-defender, and I think he's going to keep improving since he's **twenty**"
The Zach Collins contract is still the most baffling one so far
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
"I don’t think they’re ring chasing. There was not a lot of money left when they signed. The Lakers were smart in waiting for all the big money to be handed out before signing a couple of guys today. They may have missed out on someone yesterday but they’re able to get much better value today. It’s not their fault that someone decided to pay Zach Collins $8M a year, Kelly Olynyk $12M and Gary Trent Jr $18M a year."
The biggest head scratcher is Zach Collins somehow got 3 for 22m and its not particularly close

"Would love him as a sixth man for the Lakers.  It's not going to happen. If his price is really falling I can see him going to the Blazers, they just lost Zach Collins."
The Dougie McBuckets and Zach Collins contracts are their cap space?  (Sidebar: Collins &amp; Lauri would have been hilarious. Two dudes with decent upside that either can’t play/foul too much on defense &amp; cant stay healthy)
"Relax man, you guys signed Zach Collins."
"I do too, and we can offer Thad Young+Zach Collins"
Zach Collins would like a word
Greg Oden/Zach Collins
And Jonathan Isaac same draft class as Zach Collins but has only played 136 games. Zach has 154.
Zach Collins has gotta be included.
"I enjoy the trash talk. No reason not to be excited for your team. I’m not excited for it, but I don’t really like the pieces and how I think they fit. But it’s LeBron so it’ll all probably work out.   All our vets are gone. We signed Doug McDermott and Zach Collins and traded away DeMar for Thad Young, Al-Fourq Aminu, and picks. It seems like we’re moving towards a soft rebuild/tank based on the youth on our roster now. Pretty exciting for the franchise to accept that it’s time to move into the next iteration of Spurs basketball."
I can't believe we paid more than this for Zach Collins.
God they would drag zach collins injury to death
"everyone is so down on him. and by flyer, i meant like a 13M deal or something. Zach Collins went 10th that same year and got a low cost deal. Both have been injured and have regressed. This is assuming Chicago don't want him back either."
"I think the Spurs are tanking, at least to the extent that SA can tank.  DeMar *was* our offense last year. He accounted for 31% of our FTs drawn per game and 36% of our FTs made per game he played in. He obviously led us in points in assists.  Granted, part of that huge disparity on offense was due to Derrick White being hurt. If White is healthy, I like our chances as a very low seed or at least with a chance in the play-in game.  Signing Zach Collins on a flyer, letting go of our vets, etc. all point to some sort of pseudo-tank."
Injury prone mediocrity you say? He'll fit in perfectly with Zach Collins on our 25-win frontcourt of the future!
"Zach Collins aint no 4, he is the cheerleader"
I'd take Zach Collins in a wheelchair over Drummond.
Zach Collins still doing his thang haha
oh your right forgot zach collins has achieved more than 3 all star selections and he totally won roty just like ben
how’s zach collins doing ?
Spurs make it 3 team trade and send Zach Collins to Hawks
"Bam should've been the last straw for Neil ""trade up to 10 to take Zach Collins"" Olshey"
Pops about corporate knowledge. Eubanks has that over jock. Zach Collins is still hurt. Maybe pop wants to trade Eubanks too. He would do well with the nets.
"Pg. Deaaron fox, ja morant,  Russell westbrook.   Sg. Jalen green,  Zach lavine , anfernee simmons, Anthony edwards   Sf. Lebron James, Paul George, miles bridges, Jayson Tatum   Pf. Giannas antekounmpo. Aaron Gordon. John Collins. Pascal siakam  C. Karl Anthony towns. Jarret Allen.  DeAndre ayton"
"Only through solidarity will the GMs of the NBA continue to be able to create toxic workplace environments, harass &amp; belittle their employees all while trading future picks for albatross contracts attached to washed stars of yore in a last-ditch effort to save their jobs.   Also if handing out $200M+ worth of contracts to Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard &amp; Moe Harkless and then passing on the likes of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby &amp; John Collins for Zach Collins isn't justifiable cause to fire someone IDK what is..."
"Also signed Meyers, Crabbe, Harkless and Evan Turner to awful deals that really killed any roster flexibility we had. Also traded up to draft Zach Collins. Also a huge douche"
I expect us to bounce back a ton next season. This roster was clearly built with tanking in mind with us taking a bad contract back for a pick and signing Zach Collins who will miss half the season. We're super reliant on Jakob Poeltl because he's literally the only rim protector on the whole roster other than Collins.
Maybe they mean Zach Collins who they drafted over Bam :)
"I think the spurs front office knew what they were doing when they built this roster. They wanted to trade Thad Young away for a pick, traded for a pick and dead cap space, and one of our biggest free agency signings was Zach Collins who will miss half the season.  We went into this season trying to get a top 10 pick while providing a good enough roster that we could see our young guys develop. Everyone on our roster will be under contract next season other than Thad Young and Lonnie Walker."
"Ad looked like he was playing highschoolers at times. I hadn't realized how bad the spurs bigs rotation was until now. It's Poeltl, Young, the ghost of Zach Collins and then it falls off a cliff. Poeltl was definitely a key absence"
"If Zach Collins was healthy last season, they would have made a deep playoff run /s"
I loved zach Collins fight. I hope we get him back in the future.
Zach Collins keeps getting game checks.  They will eventually rename DNP-Injury to DNP--ZC
"No one wants to come to Portland and LMA left a team that was on pace to win 60+ games before it got injured.  He wanted to tank after LMA left so Dame would get some help via talent in the draft but Dame+CJ was too good.  Otherwise, his biggest blunder is the 2017 draft where Dame begged Olshey to acquire Donovan Mitchell but it didn't happen since the front office went with Zach Collins instead."
"According to LTMRs, league-wide referees make the correct decision 92.24% of the time. Zach is at 91.58%, so he's roughly average.   Note: all this data is for the 2015-2019 seasons.

"I don't know if I agree.  Having 3 first round picks in 2017, turning it into 2 first round picks and having them both end up being total busts is a real killer.  I'm like 90 percent sure Zach Collins doesn't actually exist.  Huge waste of a top 10 pick.  A team as good as the Blazers shouldn't have a crack at the top 10, they just blew it."
Any idea when Zach Collins will be back?
"I would move Lonnie and Zach Collins to Uncertain and Keita Bates-Diop to lock in. Bates-Diop is under contract next year for 1.5M so no reason to move on from him when he's shown flashes of being a decent contributor. If Lonnie doesn't show significant improvement and gets a decent offer, there's a very real chance we let him walk next offseason. If Collins looks like he won't recover from his injuries well, we probably waive him since his contract is barely guaranteed after this season."
"That game reminded me of when Blazers 2nd and 3rd string won against a great team and I just looked it up and it happened to be versus the 76ers on February 4th lol. Damian, McCollum, Zach Collins and Nurkic were all hurt. We had CJ Elleby (not McCollum) on the floor for 31 minutes. I guess ya'll got your revenge"
"Not even close to the same team. The year we got swept by the pelicans we had just acquired Nurk at the trade deadline, the year against the Lakers, Nurk, Zach Collins missed almost the entire season, no Evan Turner, no Kanter, harkless, aminu, Curry, Layman, added Whiteside, Melo,  Wenyen Gabriel, and were playing Simons and Trent minutes for the first time."
Don’t forget Zach Collins and John Wall
"They actually did run a more aggressive defense well with Kanter in the playoffs a few years back, but that was with Zach Collins and a couple okay defenders backing him up. The drop off from healthy Collins (or someone like Nance) to Melo is just absurd though."
Zach Collins shout out.
Are you guys expected to keep Zach Collins this offseason? Gotta imagine they would much rather have him than Enes as the backup 5.
"Didn't he play the playoffs last year with a cracked tailbone or something? And balled out? Some Blazers fans are just really vicious, I think your take is far more reasonable.   I'm not sure if he's a championship second player, but he probably could be next to say an Embiid or Kawhi or someone like that. Maybe even Luka. Those are all bigger guys, and with the exception of Luka, prefer a smaller playmaker to help out with scoring as well. Luka had great playmaking and is really big for a guard but is weaker on D as well, so it may not fit quite as well as the other two though.  Nurk's probably the second best Blazer player however. He obviously fouled out and has had injury issues. But when healthy, that moves CJ to third, and he's really, really good as a third option/third best player, and with Nurk covering up defensive issues I don't think it's that bad as a fit either. Also what happened to Zach Collins. Is he still there? I thought he was the starting forward."
Zach Collins is injured so not 'completely healthy.'
Waiting for Zach Collins to come back is getting to be my favorite part about every year!
holy shit zach collins still exists
IMO Jimmy is exactly who Portland needs. That and a large supply of bubble wrap for zach collins
"the unfortunate part is that I am not sure what's out there for them that makes them better.  The only young pieces they have are Simons &amp; Zach Collins, neither of whom hold a lot of value.  In theory maybe you can package those guys with the Derrick Jones Jr. contract for another veteran wing player but it's really tough to find an available player that moves the needle for them.  I don't know what you are getting for CJ McCollum (you could think about someone like Khris Middleton but the Bucks probably aren't interested) that makes the team better and Nurkic is expiring and I don't know how much value he has either.  Powell is a free-agent, maybe the team brings him back or maybe they can S&amp;T him to his preferred destination for something good."
Is that Neil Olshey’s music??   *signs Jamal Crawford to a 2 year deal and cuts promo about how Zach Collins coming back will be the difference maker*
"Trailblazers receive: Jimmy Butler   Heat receive: CJ McCollum, Anferney Simons, Zach Collins, 3 first round picks   (My friend who is a Blazers fan doesn’t want to give up Simons because he is the future after Dame. I don’t really see why the Blazers should be stubborn about keeping anyone besides Lillard after this game)"
I think my girlfriend is going to leave me for Zach Collins
"All my boys hate Zach Collins, loudest scrub in the league  Get at em Austin"
Him and Zach Collins for sure.
"When fully healthy I see Isaac as on that OG Anunoby or Ben Simmons, tier of hugely impactful defensive wing with great positional versatility and switchability.  The Magic were legit stoppers a minute ago, and it was because Isaac was an insane presence, there were some good articles and content on the subject and what a meaningful anchor of a defense Isaac proved to be.    Unfortunately he’s another case of a promising young player’s career disrupted by injury issues, he’s a better player in every way than Zach Collins though, on both ends, though both are pretty putrid presences on the offensive end.  You mostly squint and highlight the promising good parts, while recognizing the issues."
"Considering the blazers are my #2 team I’ve been watching since they drafted dame. I’d consider that I’ve watched a considerable amount of Zach Collins, too slow to play PF and too weak to play center. I’m particularly critical on Zach as I was very high on him in his Gonzaga days so I’m salty he didnt pan out how I would’ve liked him to this far. Your take is fair, he’s not a bum, I just think he’s an injury prone tweener that either needs to get faster or get stronger"
"If we offer him 10/2 vs 7/1 I see him taking the 10/2 instead. We aren’t giving him anymore than the QO and with his history if he wants more than a year he’s gotta go cheaper aav.  He obviously does more than just foul dudes. He fills a specific role off the bench. Nurk can’t play 48 minutes and Zach is better than Kanter on defense.  I was literally just speaking about how Collins is going to be cheap. Nothing more. Obviously we missed on players. We drafted CJ over Giannis. Everybody passed on Jokic, some twice. Zach was a good prospect out of Gonzaga and while still a small reach at 10, nobody thought those other dudes would work out to the point the have. Mitchell was traded from Denver to Utah just that night."
I never said he was even nearly as good as those guys lol. I think we offer somewhere around 5m/yr for a 2+1 or 1+1. Something incentive based. I seriously doubt he gets anything more than a minimum from anywhere but here.  Having Nurk as our enforcer and our only rim protector is a bad idea. That’s the exact role Zach Collins fills. Play hard off the bench and not worry about fouling. I’d also hesitate to use the 11 games he played last season in any evaluation of him.
"Durability is an attribute, one that Zach Collins has been decidedly dogshit at. Blazers need to move on from him before they get stuck on him just like Utah did with Donte Exum"
"define cheap.  His QO is $7M next year, so anything that isn't significantly more than that won't fly because Collins can bet on himself, take the $7M for one year and then hit UFA where the Blazers might lose him for nothing.    If the Blazers do try &amp; work a contract with him this summer then they're throwing good money after bad and hamstringing their flexibility going forward and limiting their options to get the most out of the rest of Dame's prime.     Also nobody needs enforcers in the NBA anymore, especially those that can't finish around the rim, foul way too much and are generally weak on the glass.  Besides, if the Blazers truly do ""need"" an enforcer, that's Nurkic.  Having more than 1 of those on a roster is a bad idea.  The only thing anyone can point to for hope on Zach Collins is an 11 game sample size where he knocked down a solid % of some of the widest open looks an NBA player will get, and even then he was wildly inconsistent night to night and the team basically asked nothing of him.  If you think any of that is somehow better than All-NBA/All-Star level players in Bam/Mitchell or one of the best wing defenders in the NBA (OG) or a walking 20/10 with legit 3-point range (John Collins, who is basically what Zach Collins is supposed to be except he's actually good) then I have some ocean-front property in the Dalles to sell you."
Well John Collins didn’t make sense from the jump so I assume Zach Collins was now on the Hawks or something since that’s the only Collins that I could think of taller than Simmons.
Insert Zach Collins joke here
"To be honest Zach Collins is not that bad, just that he has been injured.."
"Zach Collins over Bam, Donovan Mitchell, OG Anunoby and John Collins. Woof."
"Mixed up Zach Collins, who is actually bigger than Simmons, with John Collins, who is definitely not bigger than Simmons since JC is only 6’ 9”."
Zach Collins not playing the last 2 seasons has really fucked you. Can actually play some defense unlike Kanter.
"Westbrook is just ridiculous no matter how anyone paints it. Not only does he have stupid high BBIQ, but his reaction speed is just nuts. His athleticism allows him to just bunny hop all over the court without expending much energy, so he can erupt at will.   Fantasy trade as a Blazer fan: CJ and Zach Collins for Russ. A lineup of Nurk, RoCo, Powell, Russ, Dame would be a ridiculous situation anywhere. I love CJ, don’t get me wrong. That’s why I think it would take him to get that done."
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"Nuggets with Murray are top tier good though.  We honestly don't know what the series looks like with both teams healthy though. We certainly wouldn't be playing Kanter over Zach Collins, and Kanter is legitimately the reason for the series being 2-2 right now.  Like our starters have straight dominated their starters in the head to head minutes   We really shouldn't lose this series; we're pretty significantly better than them without Murray IMO."
"Easier said than done. Portland's got all their money tied up in Dame and CJ (next year almost 75 million just between them TWO!!!). Everyone else is on really good value contracts really. Nurk is on 12 million. RoCo is 13 million. Melo is on a vet min, and he is gotta be the most productive vet min contract in the entire league. Rest are rookie contracts.  There is no cap space available. Only thing Portland can try is to trade CJ, but firstly he's Dame's best friend, and secondly probably can't get an equal value return for CJ.  Firing Stotts may well turn into the same scenario like Indy where the new guy won't do any better.  I think Portland most likely goes with the same players next season (maybe new coach), and hope Zach Collins is healthy and good, and the rest of youngsters like Anfernee Simons and Nas Little make a leap."
"I mean even we weren't interested until we lost Zach Collins AND Rodney Hood due to injury (and even Skal got injured too maybe?), and it became abundantly clear that all of our other new forwards were mediocre (Bazemore) to disaster (Hezonja, Tolliver).   Portland was even more injured that season than normal, and was desperate for anyone remotely able to play the 4. Melo fit the bill, and it has worked out pretty well ever since."
"Ya, definitely agree. These series' have really shown how valuable someone like Zach Collins would be.   The big question for the Lakers is if AD/Bring get doubled, can Kuzma/KCP and friends shoot their way out of a brown paper bag."
Im not sure I'd give Zach Collins for KP at this point lol
"This trade happened between the Kings &amp; Blazers.  Involved Harry Giles, Justin Jackson &amp; Zach Collins."
We need Zach Collins to be healthy and take some of Kanter and Melo’s minutes.
If the likely outcome is Zach Collins or Paul Millsap then they will have failed at their attempts at getting an impact player.
Gonna fuck around and go nuts with a monster deal like offering Paul Millsap a hefty multi-year contract.   Maybe even Zach Collins.   Holy shit.
"Zach Collins, Larry Nance Jr. and Paul Millsap are considered ""major splash"" ?"
Depending the series on Zach Collins is a joke. Dude haven’t played for 2 years. They seriously need to retool around dame.. hope dame sees it too and not be emotional about it
"I was thinking something similar today watching Zach Collins celebrate on the Blazers bench! They've been patient with him and they've kept their trust in him through all the injuries! What if they hadn't, and they'd used him in a trade? You're not going to get the same level of trust/continuity at every franchise, and sometimes that gets lost on them!"
"If we lose to Denver fully healthyish I think they do a quick retool. CJ most likely the one headed out for peices   You can't blame this series on Zach Collins being hurt.   Anything short of finals appearance and Stotts most likely gone.  Might even have a new GM next year. I think the line in the sand has been drawn. This series vs Denver is very significant to what direction the Blazers go.   If you lose to presumably the Lakers next round, it's not as embarrassing but to Denver banged up."
No way you have a Zach Collins flair. Holy sad
"Blazers have a really good option but he is injured. Zach Collins was the reason we could start kanter. They were able to play good minutes together when we needed a stretch 4 and also zach is a really good help defender. and in that series when we need a defensive big we would place Collins, he didn't stop jokic as none really can, but he slowed him down a lot more than kanter does."
"absolutely.  Also Nurk's offense is iffy at best.  He's a good passer but he has poor touch around the rim.  I would love to see Dame paired with an athletic roll man, really he needs a good playmaker on the short roll so they can beat the trap, if only Neil Olshey had drafted Bam instead of taking Zach Collins, woof"
But Zach Collins...
Zach Collins by far the biggest clown in the league. Dude talks so much shit for being so ass when he's not injured.
Is Zach Collins even close to returning?
"Zach Collins is injured for the Blazers, too. I’d imagine he’d be making somewhat of a positive impact off the bench compared to Kanter/Melo"
This sounds crazy but Zach Collins. Having watched his whole career it’s clear that this dude is an absolute hot head.
God damn Nate.  And eff those two Zach Collins bros in the crowd.  Hope this series turns into 08 hawks vs Boston.
"i dont know who zach collins is, but after this 5 second clip i really, really dislike this person."
"They did, just Harkless and Aminu were backup caliber forwards playing 30 minutes a game.  Portland just didn't have the supporting shooting or playmaking in 2018.  He followed that really poor performance up with a run to the WCF despite having a frontcourt of injured and fasting Kanter + Harkless and Aminu.    He's a solid coach.  Not elite, but unless Spo is willing to return to Portland I'm not sure if Portland can lure anyone better.    The issue, more than anything, is Olshey's roster construction and drafting.  We have 2 forwards and one of them is Melo.  We absolutely blew the 2017 draft where we had 3 first rounders and walked away with Zach Collins and Swanigan.  Hindsight is 2020, but there is a world where Portland could have had Donovan Mitchell and Kuzma from that draft, or if we didn't trade up John Collins, OG Anunoby/Jerrett Allen, and Kuzma/White/Hart.  I'm not even convinced we needed to trade up for Zach Collins.  That offseason where we dumped money on Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner was also a disaster."
"You clearly have never been to a game in Boston or Philly. I have and Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland. I also went to U Mich.  Denver fans are no where near that, but cool stuff there.  Edit: that being said Zach Collins is a douche, but that fan is 100% embarrassing to our fan base. I agree with you on that. Show some class"
Remember when the Blazers had Zach Collins &amp; Meyers Leonard? They love the oft-injured big man (see Nurkic as well)
"Zach Collins has to make impact somehow, because he keeps on getting injured."
"I like the Blazers a lot, but man, I could not understand why before the bubble last year everyone was acting like they were about to be worldbeaters when Zach Collins of all people got healthy again lol. Nurk, I get, but Zach Collins?"
"This injured player vs injured player banter would be funny if Zach Collins wasn't the equivalent to the Naruto ""Team 7 at 99.9% meme"""
When is Zach Collins playing again? When did he last play?
"A lot of their problems go back to the summer of 2016 when they blew their cap space on Evan Turner and Allen crabbe. Also, Zach Collins was a terrible pick"
Fuckin Zach Collins and RHJ seem to be a world class shit talkers from the bench.
Nuggets got lucky that Zach Collins was injured.
Will zach Collins ever play again ? Dude been on a milk carton all year is he still hurt
We have one but he’s hurt. Zach Collins.
“No zach Collins”  Forgot that guy existed tbh
Zach Collins if he ever plays again lol
Zach Collins
"Portland had a lot more issues. Nurkic alone missed 66 games, let alone Rodney Hood tearing his Achilles (and missing half the season), Trevor Ariza missing half the season, Zach Collins missed nearly the entire season, etc  I mean their starting frontcourt for most of the season was Kent Bazemore, Carmelo Anthony, and Hassan Whiteside and they still managed to make the playoffs."
I still wish Zach Collins was healthy. One of these years we'll have a full roster for the playoffs.
Zach Collins over there like he’s in Aerosmith
What tf is Zach Collins wearing?
&gt; fuck you ho  Zach Collins
sigh... because he's Zach Collins...
Why is Zach Collins throwing up middle fingers towards the nuggets bench lmao
It looked like to me the boos were for Zach Collins flipping off Jamal Murray.
Zach Collins
Zach Collins is cute enough to make me a Blazers fan.
More like Ant + Zach Collins
I hope Dame was at least up there. Man willed the Blazers to 6th while CJ and Nurk and other supporting cast (Zach Collins) were out for big chunks of the season.
"Don’t get me wrong, I love when the bench gets hyped and all the reactions/celebrations, but I really wish there was a buffer zone for those corner 3s. Our current reigning bench cheerleader Zach Collins has a history of basically yelling in a shooter’s ear during those corner shots, and it seems like the cheapest shit ever."
"He should come to portland. We give up Zach Collins (oft injured but some potential still if healthy), Simons, Derrick Jones."
"But the season Dame is referring to for himself was last season, when he had no help.  The guy who many consider our 2nd best player because of his impact on both ends (Nurkic) only played like 8 games last season.  Rodney Hood, our starting SF (who was shooting almost 50% from 3) played in only 21 games before his injury and was then out the rest of the season.  Our starting PF (Zach Collins) played in the first 3 games of the season before getting injured and not coming back until the final games of the season.  Ariza missed the last 22 or so games of the season.  So I don't see how an argument can really be made that Dame had better talent around him last season than Curry did this season. That's just my 2 cents though 🤷‍♂️"
"Still hate you from the Sonics days. But I have changed from a team specific rooting to player specific rooting and I love what dame stands for. So I will root for them here and there. I think you guys are missing an althetic and lengthy big, the piece that is always injured in Zach Collins. But the backcourt may be to small to survive in the playoffs. I really hope nurkic stays healthy so we can finally see what this team could be."
"I acknowledge that Dray is a very good passer. Yeah, it’s not easy to always capitalize on those situations. But, we are also comparing him to Jokic and Bam not Nurk and Zach Collins. As I say, he’s very good, but we also can’t deny he is put in positions to succeed."
"Let me just go down the roster. There's a lot of unknowns.   Dame - definitely staying  CJ - if we make it out of the first round, I'd say he's definitely staying. If we lose in the first round, who knows. Total wildcard  Norm - another total wildcard. Will he want to stay somewhere he's the 3rd best guard? If he does, how much are we willing to pay a 3rd 6'3 guard who we'll have to play at SF? Repeater tax is an issue as well  RoCo - definitely staying  Nurk - definitely staying  Melo - likely upto him if he wants to play another season. I don't see us not signing him if he wants to come back  DJJ - has a PO for 10mil so he could leave for a bigger role, but idk how much money he'll find. I think he stays  Anfernee Simons - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Enes Kanter - likely gonna re-sign him, but definitely possible that we let him walk  RHJ - unless he gets a better offer from somewhere else, I think we'd keep him on a min  Nassir Little - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Harry Giles - probably going somewhere else where he'll either get more than a minimum or will get more mins  Zach Collins - another wildcard. How do you come to a fair contract value with someone who essentially hasn't played in 2 years. Gun to my head, we re-sign him even if it's just the QO  CJ Elleby - staying"
[Zach Collins the “unicorn”. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Eo8YaNQ)
"Zach Collins been training in the Hyperbolic time chamber, some unicorn on unicorn violence is the only answer."
Or Nurk and 1/2 of Zach Collins for Plumdog.
"By #1 draft pick standards, though, that *is* a scrub. And it's even worse when you consider how many other big men from Kwame's draft class--Pau Gasol, Zach Randolph, Tyson Chandler, even Jason Collins--had longer, more successful careers than Kwame did. I respect him standing up for himself and pushing back against the narratives around him, but those narratives exist for a reason. You can't be the #1 draft pick in this league and then only put up a career that would be pretty good for a second-rounder without people calling you a scrub."
"Dame trap is a real issue. I remember them playing the warriors in the playoffs awhile back and they trapped Dame the same way the blazers trapped Steph in the 1-5 pick and roll, only difference is Steph was passing out of the double to Draymond and Dame was passing to I think Zach Collins. So I think they do know the correct way to attack that trap, they just don’t have the personnel to beat it."

"Khris Middleton last year, Tobias Harris, Chris Paul, Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Zach Lavine, Mikal Bridges, John Collins were all pretty close-very close"
"Ask the Portland sub about these guys. We could have had both of them, instead we have Zach Collins, who can't even stay on the court whether he's injured or not."
zach collins
Blazers can only trade or draft well. All their key players are drafted.. right now still no free agents want to go to Portland. The only way is blazers play their first round picks. (Nassir/zach Collins/ simons). Or trade big for someone like Ben simmons or tobias Harris who has a long term contract.
"Zach Collins is the biggest himbo in the league, don’t even try me"
A barely used Zach Collins
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
"Can't tell if youre being sarcastic or not, because people do think he sucks at drafting somehow.  Dame and CJ were amazing picks.  Plus, basically every second round pick he's ever made has become a rotation player, if not a starter. His first round picks are hit and miss, but for the most part, he's hit, especially considering we pick in the 20s every time. Anfernee Simons, Nassir Little, are great picks at 24 and 25. Zach Collins was a good pick, if he could ever be healthy. Yeah there were much better players picked after him, so it's not a *great* pick, but for the average 10th pick, it was solid. Swanigan was a bust though"
I’ve seen Zach Collins at Qdoba
"I think it makes a ton of sense for both sides. It certainly has a chance at happening, we’re just so early into this being that the Sixers season only ended a few hours ago still. I’d expect Portland would have to give up something additional to CJ, yes, just based on the age and upside. Maybe it’s a wonky sign-and-trade with Zach Collins also going to Philly."
I can tell you have good player evaluation since u like Zach “ER” Collins lol
Zach Collins in shambles.
"He has CJ/Norman Powell/ Melo who can all score very well and somewhat initiate the offence if Dame wants to play offball. Nurkic is a good big, just very injury prone. Robert Covington is a good wing defender who can knock down some 3s. Anfernee Simons is a great spark off the bench and is a very good shooter, he is only scratching his potential. Zach Collins was good, no idea what he's like now after the injuries.   All in all, Portland have a good roster. It's just very unbalanced because of their lack of defensive stoppers. They would literally need maybe 2/3 trades and their team, on paper anyway, can be 1-4th seed in the west."
"Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, plus picks for Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons and Zach Collins. Who says no if Dame demands a trade?"
How is Zach Collins? Maybe if they trade for this you guys can just load manage during the season and hope for the best
"it's a sensitive subject for sure, and it's not easy for Blazer fans since the team does get overlooked and there's a regular trope about Dame wanting to leave (it's louder than it's ever been lately but it's been persistent), so it's natural to want to stick up for the franchise.  And Neil has made some good moves, I've always described him as incredibly high variance, he either hits a home-run (drafting Dame, getting Nurkic AND a first for Plumlee) or brutally strikes out (paying $200M for Meyers, Crabbe, Harkless &amp; ET; trading up to take Zach Collins ahead of Mitchell/OG/Bam/John Collins, drafting Anfernee Simons when the team needed help immediately).  Olshey can't change gears, and that will kill you as a small market GM, the margin for error is as slim as it gets.  Bring on the rain, if for no other reason than to keep knocking down all the pollen in the air!"
Blazers wouldn't play Nurk with Simmons; they'd want shooting at the 5.  Zach Collins would be literally perfect if he wasn't always injured.
"Blazers have more shooters than Philly. Lillard, Powell, Simons are elite 3 point shooters and RoCo is quite good as well. You can hide Ben Simmons on offense if he is surrounded by 4 shooters and all he needs to do is defense,  rebounding, and playmaking. Hopefully once his confidence recovers he can start contributing offensively in the paint, which is more open because of all the blazers camped out along the 3 point line.   This is especially true if Zach Collins comes back healthy and plays well,  because he can shoot the 3 better than Nurkic."
"Tons of teams were dumb that offseason. The blazers probably could've gotten Kawhi for McCollum, Zach Collins, and a first. The lakers wouldn't include Ingram with any of their other young players."
"Any CJ trade is predicated on retaining Norman Powell, who's a better fit next to Dame and can reasonably be expected to score more with more touches, based on what we saw this season and what all the Raps fans have been saying about him. Other than that it might get a little dicey if Roco is cold and we lose Melo to free agency but I still think it puts us in a better spot. We've got wildcards in Zach Collins' return, Ant Simons probably coming back, and the possibility of Nurk getting better at the rim, he's an offensive powerhouse if he works on his finish."
I think this framework makes sense for everyone. Even tho Simmons stock is at an all time low. Philly probably needs to receive another legit rotation player. Maybe throw in Zach Collins or Josh Okogie to Philly.

"Y’all fools acting like this isn’t way under value for Drummond. We just paid Zach Collins, who doesn’t have function legs, $22mil. Drummond is definitely worth more than that deal."
Zach Collins. lol
"They're talking about Zach Collins, who Lauri would be playing next to on the spurs."
Spurs signed Zach Collins
"&gt; He's worth 10M a year at least imo  I don't know about *at least* but I think a lot of teams with a full MLE at their disposal should have been interested. BORD$ sees him worth about 7.5 this year, in the same range as Zach Collins, Bjelica, and Doug McDermott"
Nobody is more injured than Zach Collins
That's what you get for signing Doug McDermott and Zach Collins.
"Zach Collins hasn't played in like 2 years and he got 3/22, so I guess that's the absolute floor for JJJ."
"at this point just like nerls that's what you get for turning down great deals. he thought he was above Indiana and ignored a big ass extension from them and an almost as big extension from Houston. fuck him at that point, enjoy a minimum or MLE if you're lucky. then again, we paid Zach Collins 7 a year so maybe he can get that somewhere too."
"Make sure to mark them ""URGENT"" or they just go to the spam folder. That's how I got them to not resign Zach Collins."
"Zach Collins is 23 bruh, teams will happily bet on that"
Was he more injured than Zach Collins cause if not he’s an upgrade.
"He still has a valuable skillset, we just saw Zach Collins get 3 yr 22 mil and I’m pretty sure Porter is a lot better than that"
Zach Collins for fleecing Brian Wright lol
"yep, that's zach collins for you."
"I'm curious as well, not going to be easy replacing Zach Collins."
I really think just missed the window.  Too conservative too long and injuries didn't help.  Those two disastrous offseasons in a row killed it(evan turner free agency then Zach Collins draft)
"If your medical staff can find a way to keep this guy on the court, this is going to be the most valuable contract in the NBA in a couple years. The ability for a contender to trade away picks and some scrub to exchange salaries for Zach Collins will bring in a huge fuckin payday.  I know he hasn't been able to stay healthy (and don't think this sub ever watched a game of his but rather meme about his injuries), but when has any big man in Portland stayed healthy?"
$22 million for Zach Collins??? I need his agent to negotiate my next divorce
signed cody zeller   lost zach collins  hotel trivago
"For real, every time I think “what does this team need?” the answer is always “what Zach Collins was supposed to be.”"
Cody is what Zach Collins could be if he played 45 games a year. Good job Portland
Zach Collins agent may be able to get some of us minimums
"John Collins is a much better shooter than Zach Collins, but both are best when used as a rim runner.  It doesn’t make sense to spend that much money on 3 players when you won’t be able to have them on the floor at the same time, as none of them can realistically play the 3 or 5 without being abused defensively."
I had to reread it several times and my first viewing was “John Collins real name is Zach?”
They got their Zach Collins replacement
He got more skills than Zach Collins I know that much.
Breaking: Zach Collins has fractured his pelvis and hip bones.  It is unclear at this time what caused the injuries.
Like Zach Collins if he was a little more healthy
They moved on from Zach Collins!
"Even if spurs renounce their FAs, don't they not have cap with the McDermott and Zach Collins signings?"
You’ve clearly never seen Zach Collins play lmao . But most nba fans haven’t since he is never healthy
"Signing zach collins, a 23 year old high risk high reward, guy missing the first 3-4 months of the season is not clearly moving in a particular direction?"
The disrespect to Zach “2019 WCF game 4 legend” Collins
Breaking news Spurs Zach Collins tore several muscles in his fingers after signing with spurs
"I was hoping for John Collins not Zach. But a big and shooting? I know we're still gonna be trash, but that's at least what we needed"
"My fried brain read this as Zach Lavine, and then John Collins lol. I legitimately forgot Zach Collins existed."
"Wrong Collins Spurs.   You're supposed to go after JOHN Collins, not Zach"
"I have never seen any evidence at all that Zach Collins is capable of being a starter, but this isn't paying him to be a starter. Plus he's still 23."
Zach Collins is as dart throw as it gets though let's gooooooo
Cause we signed Zach Collins?
More like Zach Collins sick amirite.
Zach “[Back the Fuck Up](https://youtu.be/ddUOdx9VuQ0)” Collins
"For quite a moment I thought about John Collins instead of Zach and got so confused, lmao"
Zach Collins to spurs
They spent 22 million of their cap space on Zach Collins and Bobby McDermott. What a waste.
I dont think ive ever seen zach collins play before
"Sure, but we haven't even really taken that many serious swings in the draft.  Yet again, the 2017 draft where we traded up from 15 and 20 for #10 to grab Zach Collins is biting us in the ass."
Y’all could sweeten it with a Zach Collins minimum sign and trade and a 2026 top 20 protected first.
"They should sign Exum and Zach Collins as well, really give their staff a good thorough test."
"shit man Rudy still moves well, who even knows how Otto looks on the court anymore. he feels like Zach Collins at this point. just a total question mark right now"
"Key points in the article:   - Gallinari is unlikely due to the Rubio trade  - Strong possibility of Prince being flipped for a PF  - Rosas and Vando couldnt agree to an extension  - Bolmaro/Jmac could be backup PG this year  - Simmons wont happen, especially with the asking price from Philly  -  Rosas has strong interest in Kuzma. If Washington are willing to move him, Wolves will be at the front of the queue for him  - Possible targets of Theis, Green, Harkless, Tucker, Craig, Cauley-Stein, Zach Collins and Bjelica"
"Remember that they're letting Zach Collins go, 2017's 10th draft pick."
Zach Lavine is on another planet compared to John Collins.
"I do think we need another proven commodity at forward for the upcoming season (isn't King a 2 way contract??). Barnes is the only guy we have on our team who I trust at any of the 3-5 spots, unless we re-sign Holmes. Jones isn't great, Queta has a ton of promise but is a rookie, and Harkless is an FA. Thompson is fine as a backup. I like Metu but he's developing, plus idr how bad his injury was last year. Not sure if Zach Collins is that guy for us but still."
I just want to reunite the French teammates of Gobert and Batum in Utah. Also Zach Collins would be cool
Your fans can’t even be bothered to have a flair and you expect to be trusted with the health and well being of Zach Collins.   Let us have him so he can truly thrive.   (Bulls)
I remember being downvoted and getting in an argument with a blazers fan because I said Zach Collins wasn't an elite rim protector
How is Kawhi better then Zach Collins?   Kawhi - Clippers  Cp3 - Suns  Lowry - Heat  Derozan - heat  Lonzo - bulls  Conley - jazz
we'll give you a promising young big named Zach Collins :)
I would put Zach Collins on this list. Developing defender and rim protector. who has a decent shot but is made of glass and can’t stay healthy
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
I am still a believer in Zach Collins
"Ya, i'de rather have Zach Collins with his broken foot than Morris."
Zach Randolph? Zach Lavine? Zyndrus Illgauskas? Zaza Pachulia? Zach Collins? Zan Tabak?
Zach Collins is perpetually injured and a unrestricted free agent. No guarantees he even comes back.   Lol at relying on a 2nd round prospect to be a starter for a team with playoff aspirations.
"Zach Collins and Greg Brown are started over Kanter, I not trying to see an center drop 30 points on us in the first half of the first quarter."
There's an always injured Zach Collins.
"wtf? not to mention what kind of flex is it that you've lived in portland for 20+ years if collins was drafted like 4 years ago lmao  half (or more?) think zach is a bust and want him gone, this is such a bizarre take"
"If you think they're precious about Simons you should see the reaction if you ever deign to criticize Zach Collins...  And before the Rip City hive comes for me: look past the flair, I've lived in Portland for longer than most of you have been alive &amp; watch the Blazers every night.  Shit, I was going to games when it was still the Rose Garden to see Z-Bo, Travis Outlaw &amp; Darius Miles."
"you know the answer... Neil Olshey had plenty of draft picks in 2017 and he traded them all for Zach Collins.  Then the next year he drafted Anfernee Simons, who was 2 years away from being 2 years away."
Portland was in a very similar situation not too long ago and decided to trade up for Zach Collins so that might answer your question
"Exactly this. We have been drafting ""for fit"" for years and look at where it's gotten us. Besides 2018 and 2020, Kings fans have been wrong about every draft it seems. We took Thomas Robinson ahead of Lillard due to fit. We traded down to get Justin Jackson and Harry Giles in 2017 because we already had WCS/just drafted Fox and didn't want to take one of Zach Collins, Bam, or Mitchell for ""fit"". McNair did the right thing taking who he thinks was the BPA at our position. At worst, it sets us up with tradeable assets."
Zach Collins. My friend always yells Conboy when scoring with him in 2k
"Sixers would be lucky to end up with Bob covington and Zach Collins, he ain't worth shit"
Offer 8: Zach Collins 😉
"I was curious, so I looked up how many teams have been able to draft an all-star outside the top ten picks of the draft since 2013. Here's the complete list.  Denver - Jokic and potentially MPJ  LAC - SGA  Miami - Bam and maybe Herro  Milwaukie - Giannis  Minnesota - Zach Lavine  OKC - Sabonis  Phoenix - Booker  Toronto - Siakam  Utah - Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert  Honorable mentions  Atlanta - No but John Collins is close  Kings - Potentially Haliburton in the future  That's an average of a little more than one all-star per year. Again, I'm intending to defend Neil Olshey here, but so many blazers fans have it in their head that we were ""just a good pick"" away from contending, as though any team is able to consistently find all-stars at the back half of the draft."
Zach Collins is better then Cade.
"And then in 2007 they drafted another injury prone center, and then a decade later drafted Zach Collins, who may never play a full season.  Damn, Portland really likes their bigs injured."
"Clarke, Hachimura, Olynyk, Sabonis, Zach Collins, and Tillie (kinda) it isn’t the best list in the world but it’s the most active players in school history I think."
Lillard was “ass” in that series because the Pels had two of the best defensive guards in the league (Jrue and Rondo who both just won a title with their defense) while AD was getting covered by rookie zach Collins and Nurkic lmao like watch the games before you say stupid shit
Zach Collins is going to come back from injury strong and average near 10 pts a game
"He was one of the most efficient 20 PPG scorers in the NBA. The dude just turned 23 and put up almost 24 ppg on 50-40? 8 players have put up close to those numbers before the age of 25 while taking at least 2 threes per game. Kevin Durant, KAT, Kawhi, Reggie Miller, Zach Lavine, John Collins, Shai and Chris Webber. So yeah he's not a role player."
Zach Collins... broke his foot in rehab during the playoffs. Went from an auto resign to never again
"Yeah I remember being mad when we traded 15 (Justin Jackson) and 20 (Harry Giles) for 10 (Zach Collins), turns out all three picks didn’t do shit"
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"
"As a Portland fan, we traded 2 picks in an amazing draft for Zach Collins instead of Bam or Mitchell or staying put and getting guys like John Collins, OG, Jarrett Allen. This fucked us so hard. So, so hard. We had to hit in that draft and it was a great draft, and we just missed completely.  So yeah, your Gonzaga core team gargles ballsack like an NBA thot on all-star weekend."
I guess the xfactor is still Zach Collins I guess.. that is the new acquisition for them
Dame and CJ.  ZACH COLLINS
"Portland as some better ones, Zach Collins and Keljin would great. Zach Collins was injured but he was the best cheerleader in the league."
"""Zach Collins' corpse"" 😂"
"CJ Mcollum, Nurk and Zach Collins corpse for Joel Embiid."
Zach Collins just stubbed his toe as you posted that comment
"Nah you got it about on the nose the Blazers 100% should let Zach Collins walk.  Anyone remember his last full season? When he put up 6/4/1 and was top 10 among players playing 1300+ minutes (he played 1356, just set the minimum at a reasonable sample size rate to weed out intentional foul guys) in fouls/36?  Zach Collins is the definition of a sunk cost, and the Blazers 100% are better off filling his roster spot on a vet min big who at least can not bite on a pump fake."
"The crazy thing about that WCF against Golden State is the Blazers had at least an 11 point lead in every game including 2 into the second half and still got swept, and that’s without Jusuf Nurkic. Zach Collins was really good defensively in that series."
We literally didn’t give him a qa. Zach sucks dude. Blazer fans have been blinded since I was adamant we drafted the wrong Collins.
I’ll remember this comment when we resign Zach Collins.
Straight up for KP. Then KP and Zach Collins can get matching suits and haircuts.
