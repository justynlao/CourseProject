"Damn Blake Murphy was right when he said:  &gt; [He’s been reported as born in Montreal, but he’s clarified that while his dad has Montreal roots, Duarte himself has only visited once. You know how this goes, though. **If he’s even a little Canadian, Canadian fans will include him in the tally.**](https://theathletic.com/2691414/2021/07/10/nba-draft-prospects-josh-primo-dalano-banton-and-five-other-canadians-on-the-radar/)"
"and as a sixers fan, i don't like it one bit.    \- the only rumored trade for ben simmons i would've seriously considered was lowry and #4, because i too love me some scottie barnes.  \- wanted dalano banton at #50 or as a udfa.  was surprised he went in the 40s.  but when i saw it was masai, it figured.  if the goal of modern offense is to create space, the goal of modern defense is to take it away."
"Raptors Scottie Barnes was fun to watch, the hustle and heart he plays with really stands out. His offence could use some work but his defence is stellar. Definitely excited for him.  Dalano Banton was a nice surprise, very versatile doing a little bit of everything. I see him growing to be a great player after a few years of experience.  Outside of the raptors Cade looks like he'll be a fun guy to watch and I look forward to seeing what he will do in the future."

Ultimate homer pick: Dalano Banton

Dalano Banton
"TORONTO RAPTORS' DALANO BANTON, THE NO. 46 PICK IN THE 2021 NBA DRAFT"
I would be pretty excited about Dalano Banton.
Dalano Banton is actually such an interesting prospect.
"Its bullshit too.  I've traveled to 14 different NBA cities, and sought out end-benchers.  Provoking a fight is easy, and I've won 13 of them.  Their big ol tree legs are a weakness, and they *slow*.  Props to Dalano Banton of the Raptors though, he fast, gives an ass-whoopin'."
Dalano Banton is such an interesting prospect.
Hey man we had to take Dalano Banton  He's Toronto Mans   But yeah Sharife was RIGHT THERE
"Hahaha didnt expect that answer. We have had Cory Joseph, Anthony Bennett, Oshee Brissett recently.  Currently we have Chris Boucher, Khem Birch and Dalano Banton. We are good for Canadian content.  I like Powell but i completely understand why they want more with that 2 year contract (even if 2nd year is a partial guarantee)"
"I think Raps front office should've had a talk with him to stay out of the media or coach him on what he'd say knowing they're shopping him around – honestly though, he's a vet and should know better.  I think the best alternate universe version of his first message to raptors fans would've started something like, he knows how special wearing no. 7 is, and that he's ready to wear no. 7 for Toronto. He's excited to get to know his teammates and the city, and represent this country both on and off the court. And literally the first photo he posts is him with Scottie Barnes, and Dalano Banton at the jerk chicken joint. A man can dream, instead he's saying he got higher ambitions – we were 4th seed before covid hit the team."
Dalano Banton fam
"After some development we can throw Precious in there too, he has huge defensive upside  Lmao, here’s a potential future lineup  Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa."
Add dalano Banton for us he’s a 6’9 point guard
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6’8.25”, Chris Boucher is 6’8”, Khem Birch 6’7.5”, Scottie Barnes 6’7”, Freddie Gillespie 6’9”, Dalano Banton 6’7.75”, Precious Achiuwa 6’7.5”, Yuta Watanabe 6’8”, and Sam Dekker 6’7.75”. So most of these guys would end up being 6’9” in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who’d be 6’8” in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who’d be 6’10” in shoes."
I’m also super intrigued by Dalano Banton and think he’ll thrive with our development team. I’m also a Husker fan though so maybe I’m way higher on him than most
OG  GTJ  Scottie Barnes  Dalano Banton  Precious
Dalano Banton
Counterpoint Dalano Banton.
Dalano Banton
Those are first round guys. How about Dalano Banton
"David Johnson with the pick from the Jazz, Dalano Banton with the pick from Sacramento."
I mean we drafted David Johnson with the pick (or maybe Dalano Banton?)
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Nick Nurse mentioned he was trying to get Chris Boucher into the game early to see if that changed his play, and that he wanted Fred to come out of the game earlier to change up his rotations and the Dalano Banton has been very impressive."
"he's like a short Dalano Banton, all the best wishes for the guy"
"Same, except for Dalano Banton. Dude is raw, but love seeing the hometown hero hustle and give it his all out there"
"Isiah Roby and Dalano Banton in the league, pretty cool!"
He’s never gonna be in the race but Dalano Banton looked impressive tonight
Going to be pretty difficult for Scottie Barnes to win RotY in a world where Dalano Banton exists.
I think it's clear who the leading candidate is for ROTY   It's mfin Dalano Banton
I am building the Dalano Banton train solo
ROTY: Scottie Barnes  Most Improved: OG Anunuby MVP: Dalano Banton
"Shout out to Dalano ""I'll fuckin' do it myself"" Banton too. Kid's a monster. Even in a 3 minute appearance he goes +7 and looks good. Reminds me a lot of the Bench Mob who always made an impact whenever they came into the game until they forced their way into the rotation."
Delusion homer      Dalano Banton &gt; Ben Simmons
"I'm glad. And I hope his decision making has improved... both on and off the court.  I think the pick we traded TDII for actually ended up being Dalano Banton, whose preseason and game 1 performance hopefully is not just a fluke."
Yeah somehow the combo of seeing mans and no comma really confused me. I also have never heard of Dalano Banton or Rexdale. On my first read I thought Rexdale mans was the players name. Idk why I was so confused by it but I was
"The “s” in “mans” is what is confusing I think. It should read, “Rexdale man, Dalano Banton…..”   There really isn’t any situation where the term “mans” is grammatically correct and the lack of a comma made it difficult to understand what was intended"
Dalano Banton really gave me false hopes and promises for A SOLID 5 MINUTES
I'm not one to overreact but Dalano Banton is the greatest basketball player to ever live.
"If we’re still getting smacked in the 4th, I want big Dalano Banton minutes."
Dalano Banton better

"I was wondering why he got reduced minutes like the rest of the fans at the start, but like he really shit the bed in the minutes he got.  Pretty sure we traded him for the pick that got us Dalano Banton so that's a W"
dalano banton is luka but longer
Just a reminder Jalen Suggs is a bust and Dalano Banton is better
hey man dalano banton looks good asf
"Three games with the bench, two games as a starter. 18mpg total, 13.3 mpg in the 3 games off the bench. And he was not good at all.  I trust Nick Nurse and our coaching staff ability to assess Goran Dragic more than either of us, and they decided that Dalano Banton was better. Anyone who watched the four games he played before being out of the rotation knows Dragic played bad, especially on defense which is a major focus for the Raptors. Dragic was bad, got outplayed by the 46th overall pick and was supplanted in the rotation."
Dalano banton
Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Pascal Siakam  Fred VanVleet  Gary Trent Jr  Precious Achiuwa  Khem Birch  Dalano Banton  Would be the likely list I imagine.

1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland
"Dalano Banton, drafted 46 this year."
Dalano Banton
Same with Dalano Banton
Dalano Banton
Dalano Banton
"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Dalano Banton. Bias aside, the kid has been consistently great in his few minutes of play every game. Late second rounder who seems to only get better."
Dalano Banton
"6'9 PG Dalano Banton.   ~~Yes, this is pure bias.~~  ~~Yes, this is satire.~~"
DALANO BANTON AND SCOTTIE BARNES
Is the winner of the Cade vs Barnes showdown Dalano Banton?
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
Massive bias but wow dalano banton is amazing
Dalano Banton got Dragic and Flynn benched.
Bah gawd thats Malachi Flynn's music!   ....who are we kidding Dalano Banton is probably starting.
"&gt;6-7 point guard Dalano Banton  He's 6'9"""

"Gary and Freddy, particularly this game, make me feel considerably less bad about not getting Tyrese Maxey.  Still would have been nice, though: Dalano Banton isn't quite the same caliber of backup PG xD"
"Dalano Banton deserves to be on that list more than Kuminga, Kispert, Moody"
"Dalano ""Justin Champagnie"" Banton"
Dalano Banton Torontos 2nd round (46) pick of the draft is 33rd by Total Raptor. The highest on the team.
More Dalano Banton you say? Coming right up!
Dalano Banton will be ROTY
He’s been okay but Banton has been better. If Nick wants to rock with Dalano it makes perfect sense to me.
I still think Dragic can contribute to a contender but it seems like the Raps have decided that developing Dalano Banton takes priority over Dragic getting minutes. He'll probably be on a different roster come spring time.
Because he’s literally not good anymore. Got played off the court my Raul Neto. Beaten in the roster by Dalano Banton. Shouldnt give him any leverage. And teams shouldn’t even want him lol.
Dalano Banton is cool as hell tho
"Most of our key guys (FVV, OG, Scottie, GTJ) are getting enough attention so it’s probably Dalano Banton right now. Leads the team in on/off and has just been bizarrely effective in crucial situations."
Can you believe the Cavs drafted Evan Mobley over Dalano Banton?
"I was a Barnes doubter pre-draft, but the dude has absolutely thriving in the NBA pace and spacing. I think this draft especially is showing the direction of where the NBA is going personnel wise. A lot of guys in the top 10 had doubters (Mobley, Barnes, Giddey, Wagner, etc) but guys with size, length, ball handling, and a high IQ are having a pretty high hit rate. Even look at a guy like Dalano Banton"
I love that he isn’t afraid to make mistakes. Guy will try something new and then scrap it if it doesn’t work. When we had Casey he was really rigid and would just fall back on late game isos from vets. Nurse is already throwing Dalano Banton out there late in games with Scottie to cause chaos.
"Lots of takeaways so far:     - OG is an Allstar? Dude is ballin    - FVV just hits shots when you need em (Chauncey Jr?)   - Trent Jr is a confident scorer and can fill it up    - Precious, Svi, Flynn, and Birch are better players than we thought   - Scottie Barnes is a special talent    - Dalano Banton  has been a massive steal"
No he said Rexdale not Rockford lol.  Rexdale = Dalano Banton Rockford = Fred Vanvleet
**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
Don’t disrespect Dalano Banton
Dalano Banton would be in the top 20. He's been really really good.   [Fivethirtyeight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) stats for rookies have him Top 3 in defence and Top 2 in Offence+Defence combined (80+ minutes played).
"I'm hoping you just forgot about giddey and you're not trying to purposely disrespect him.  Dalano Banton tho, idk how you don't take him over someone like Cooper if you need a point guard. Neither shoot all that well, but dalano is 6'9 and cooper is like 5'11."
"We must be doing something in development and culture to cultivate talent. We’ve seen Dalano Banton shine post- pre-season for instance. Besides his own work ethic and hunger, I have to imagine the Raptors org is working with him to improve his game and make adjustments throughout for him to have produced so early…?"
"Dalano Banton, the tall ass PG on the Raptors"
Dalano Banton exist.
"If he's shooting now, maybe we should throw in Dalano Banton along with Barnes, OG, Siakam and a handful of first round picks?"
"Jalen ""unanimous 4th pick"" Suggs last night: 10/5/6 and 2 turnovers on 3-13 and 0-4 from three  Better than Dalano Banton??????"
Dalano the Hitman Banton
Dalano Banton is a definitely steal at where he was drafted from
Franz Wagner tonight: 10/4/2 with a steal.  Dalano Banton tonight: 10/5/2 with a couple steals.
"Dalano Banton has the career arc of a MyPlayer on pro,"
"Game Notes   - Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.   - Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly   - Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.   - Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)   - Chris Boucher finally had a good game.   - Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.   - Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)"
Why in the world would the Raps trade Dalano Banton after the flashes he's shown this month?
&gt;Dalano Banton   Lost me here
