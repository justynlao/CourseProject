Blocks are poor measure for rim protecting. That's how get people thinking Hassan Whiteside is good on defense
he was being guarded by hassan whiteside
"ya, It‚Äôs obvious the league is pushing for Zion for the playoffs the past two seasons. They knew AD required a thunderous package and having Zion with a few good players was the proper nudge they needed. Compared to him spending 4 years in the lotto with Fox, Hassan Whiteside and Marvin Bagley at the time"
"Dedmon was the steal of the deadline, my god how I‚Äôve missed having a real center. Hassan Whiteside damn near scared Spo off an entire position for life."
"That's fair, and I'm probably biased after a year of Hassan Whiteside almost any amount of effort looks exceptional"
"Hassan Whiteside doesn‚Äôt prove that every elite shot blocker is a bad defender, he proves that it‚Äôs possible for an elite shot blocker to be a bad defender and that the possibility shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed. The argument isn‚Äôt that Myles Turner‚Äôs not an elite defender because Hassan Whiteside isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs that Myles Turner isn‚Äôt for various other reasons and his blocks per game do not mean he‚Äôs automatically a great defender because great shot blockers can still be terrible defenders, such as Hassan Whiteside."
"Dude, centers don‚Äôt just develop defence overnight, especially if they‚Äôre already lost defensively. His offence is better than his D. It‚Äôs gonna be a long developmental process to get him to be an average defender, let alone a shot blocking defensive center. He has a *lot* to work on in that end.  He looks, to me, like he could be Christian Wood on offence and Hassan Whiteside on defence in his prime. Which is fine, that‚Äôs a good player, but it‚Äôll take years and years to get him to that level.  Why not just trade for a defensive center? Those are easy to find. Im sure Myles Turner would only cost like, Kelly Oubre &amp; a pick"
\*eyeballs Hassan Whiteside\*
"Like everyone involved at the malice at the palace for some reason. Ben, Rasheed, Chauncey, Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal, Ron artest, Stephen Jackson all have that narrative. The warriors and bullets gave up on Chris Webber weirdly fast. Hassan Whiteside kinda seemed like he was gonna be the epitome of this when he originally signed with the heat and lead the league in blocks after being cut by the kings and playing 2 years overseas"
Doncic elbowed Hassan Whiteside in the face last year though (and hit Theis the year before) so that would be prior history like Draymond right?
Lakers should have signed Hassan whiteside.
Hassan whiteside was just trying to get his 2k rating up.
Welcome to the world of Hassan Whiteside on the Blazers. A double-double machine and still was a massive liability on the court.
Hassan Whiteside II: Electric Boogaloo
This was originally called The Hassan Whiteside Experience
Hassan whiteside 2.0
"    Hassan Whiteside  He‚Äôs not the best free throw shooter but he just casually throws it up. Flicks it up the moment he gets the ball, I‚Äôm always like wtf."
"I've been waiting for someone to make this post since last night, I was trying to look up the official stats but don't have a subscription to bball reference.  He's looked absolutely terrible. Also Drummond has looked like the worst high usage player I've ever seen. I literally asked my Laker friend last night if he would rather have Andre Drummond or Hassan Whiteside since they're both known as empty stat players.  We basically agreed that Whiteside might be better at this point since he doesn't have concrete hands and will at least finish passes that are spoonfed to him. He also doesn't try and play like he's a star and take up posessions turning the ball over constantly.  Also, want to shoutout this lovely OC by our community that seems to get more true every day I watch Drummond play: [Andre Drummond is the WORST high usage offensive player in the league and it's not close](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lki28p/oc_andre_drummond_is_the_worst_high_usage/)"
Hassan Whiteside - vet minimum.
Wait till I tell you about Hassan Whiteside
lowkey could get Hassan Whiteside treatment if he doesn't thrive in literally one of the best situations possible
"As long as Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond are still in the league, I can't say shit about Kanter.  He's one of the best offensive rebounders and is a bucket on the offensive end. Yeah, defensively he's not great - but Portland got to the WCF with him playing big minutes two years ago, so is he really that bad?"
Yawnis deadass shoots a lower 3P% than Hassan Whiteside ü§£üíÄ (30.8 vs 29)
The advanced stats back Jokic up since it was used to predict he would turn into a mvp candidate. This isn't like hassan whiteside who advance stats paint as an all star when he is 3rd string at best.
@wojespn: ‚ÄúThe Portland Trailblazers have signed Hassan Whiteside to a vet minimum.‚Äù
Gotta go with Hassan Whiteside
And Defensive specialist Hassan Whiteside! Lead by Luke!
Jones and Metu played the backup center role against the Warriors this week.  In over 25 minutes they combined for ONE rebound.   Luke Walton is doing literally anything to avoid playing Hassan Whiteside
"Yeah and see the kings. Who knows what players like DeMarcus Cousins, Ben mclemore, and Marvin Bagley would develop like if they started their careers in say San Antonio, Miami, or Philadelphia. Unfortunately though they were drafted to basketball hell :( I‚Äôm sure that the organization has an enormous effect on a rookie‚Äôs development, and the kings have had a 10-15 year stretch of (mostly) draft misses that can‚Äôt just be consequence.  Funny enough, one of our best players we drafted was at 60th, Isaiah Thomas. Who ended up doing much much better after leaving the kings. And another one of our better draft picks was a second rounder, Hassan Whiteside. Although he needed a couple years out of the league to properly develop"
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Coby White  Michael Redd  Tarik Black  Aaron Gray  Derek Rose  Hassan Whiteside  Cam Reddish  Red Robbins
Hakeem Olajuwon would be a slightly better Hassan Whiteside in today's NBA so him
Hassan Whiteside
"I agree with you tbh.. Sure he's athletic but nothing seems out of the ordinary (and the footage that do seem unreal are pretty low quality or are in very biased angles) just look at JaVale McGee or Mitchell Robinson highlights and come back to this. sure Wilt was ahead of his time in size and athleticism which let him dominate weaker opponents, but the quality of the NBA has gotten so much better. Not even joking but if we hypothetically teleported average players like JaVale, Mitchell Robinson, Hassan Whiteside, Jarrett Allen, or Drummond back to the 60's, all of these guys would be another Wilt, so I don't get the argument why people would pick him over modern day superstars who are way ahead in nutrition, training, and skill (unless you hypothesize that Wilt grows up again with modern day training which is asking too much)"
"Hassan Whiteside for the HEAT. He can effortlessly block shots, but he's also effortless on defense as a whole. He dives in every PnR expecting a pass and gets visibly upset when it doesn't happen. When he receives the ball on the low-post, forget about it. Get back on D as he'll either attempt a shot or fumble it."
"Sure 28th and 29th defense but 3rd and fourth-ranked offense.  You guys also went from Nurkic, Aminu, Ed Davis, Evan Turner(16thD,4thO) to Nurkic playing 8 games, Hassan Whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and Simons(27thD, 3rd O)."
The hassan whiteside level effort
Now the problem with this is 3 years ago Bam was playing 20mpg backing up Hassan Whiteside lmao
&gt; who is worse than their highlights  Hassan Whiteside - dude would go out of his way to get highlight blocks
"&gt;passes a much different eye test than Kyrie did  And that's a very valid point and kind of what I was trying to show.    Defensive stats in general are very goofy. Brad Stevens: *""When I get an e-mail that has defensive metrics in it, I delete it.""*   Advanced stats like DRTG really don't show much of anything besides the team is good.   Raw stats like steals/blocks/rebounds don't show enough of the picture to actually declare a player is even good defensively.  * Steph Curry has led the league in steals  * Hassan Whiteside had led the league in blocks  * Andre Drummond has led the league in rebounds  I'm not saying Matisse is bad (he's obviously a very good defender), but DPOY is such a high bar to clear. Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart and Chris Paul have never even cracked top 5 in votes. As an undersized defender with limited team-wide impact, Matisse has no real chance at DPOY.  Plus DPOY is a term we see thrown about by Philly fans.   * Embiid is a DPOY candidate (although he actually is) * Covington was a DPOY candidate * Simmons is a DPOY candidate * Thybulle will be a DPOY candidate  You can't just label everyone a DPOY candidate."
"&gt;I‚Äôm sorry. What?  - Hassan Whiteside, I‚Äôd imagine"
"No. Rim protector stays under the rim, the defense scheme with rim protector is usually tightly marked mid range-3pt shots, and give you space to drive so rim protector deals with the drive. That's what Orlando did with Howard, and Pacers in early 2010s with Hibbert. Hassan just wandering around chasing for blocks forgotting his mark.  Rim protectors let shots go at times, Hassan Whiteside block shots at times. That's the difference."
Hassan Whiteside is being absolutely wasted by Hassan Whiteside
Hassan Whiteside is bad at basketball.
"I understand that there's a gap, my question is why the hell does it matter? He's missed 17 games, no shit there's a gap in total minutes played as well as a result. You would think he's on a 15 minutes per game minutes restriction. He plays 32 minutes per game, which is in line with most players.   Furthermore, there's literally no meaningful outcome in the NBA that's decided on a per minute basis. Things are done per season, per series, per game, or per possesion. Nobody gives a shit about outscoring their opponent in any given minute. Fans don't pay to watch a game on a per minute basis. Neither in a basketball sense, nor in a business sense do minutes matter. Nobody tracks total minutes a player plays as anything except for as a negative thing - for all the obsession with modern analytics lately, why do we suddenly ignore that here?  There is no correlation between total minutes played in a season with how good a player is, or anything related to MVP. The minutes leaders last season were CJ, Booker, Harden, Barnes, Dame, Tobias, PJ TUcker, Shai, Bam, and Mitchell. Giannis won MVP ranked 67th.   Year before that, Beal, Harden, Kemba, Tobias, PG, Dame, Tucker, KD, Simmons, Derozan. Giannis wins MVP ranked 47th.   Year before that, Lebron, middleton, Wiggins, Beal, Jrue, CJ, Towns, Russ, PG, Giannis. Harden wins MVP ranked 29th.   Year before that, Wiggins, Towns, Harden, Giannies, Wall, Butler, Barnes, Westbrook, CJ, Lebron. Westbrook wins ranked 8th.   2016, Harden, Hayward, Kemba, Ariza, Marcus Morris, Middleton, Lowry, Wiggins, Giannis, PG. Steph wins MVP ranked 20th.   2015, Harden, Wiggins, Ariza, Dame, CP3, Wall, Deandre, Bledsoe, Joe Johnson, Kyrie. Steph wins ranked 19th.   This has been a weird ass way of shitting on Embiid throughout his entire career that's unprecedented. Despite all of the games and minutes missed, he's still basically ranked 20/19/21 for Points/Rebounds/Blocks TOTAL for the season. The only thing total minutes should matter for when evaluating a player is to make sure you gather a sufficient enough sample size to make sure the statistics you're gathering aren't fluke. If Embiid was Hassan Whiteside and has 1 good half a season in a contract year, you might be on to something. But I think at this point in his career, he's played enough to demonstrate that his value passes the eye test and he's for real."
"He could Hassan Whiteside his way until mid 40‚Äôs at the earliest.   Jump in during a blowout.    But my best guess is during his final years, he will go to a team that‚Äôll give him the option of buying an ownership stake and/or drafting his son"
&gt;Hassan Whiteside averaged 16 14 and 3 blocks  I didn't say Whiteside averaged 15/15 üíÄcan you read? I pointed out another big man who puts up empty stats and sucks ass. Good points and rebounding do not = good player.
Hassan Whiteside averaged 16 10 and 3 blocks for Portland last year. He still sucks and was moved out of the rotation when Jusuf Nurkic came back. Box score savants like you are so clueless

Hassan Whiteside lol
The even more interesting thing is it happens every time he gets hurt.   2 seasons ago he went down for 10 games. We went 8-2 with the best offense in the entire league.   He's the Hassan Whiteside of SG. The stats are crazy empty.
"Best player in the first half when everyone played like complete shit? The dude got fucking destroyed by Hassan whiteside.. he folds like a chair against anyone that‚Äôs close to his size. For crying out loud, he makes Zubac look like Hakeem whenever they face off."
remember the hassan whiteside post on ig in which he literally hits just one three and tells that they don‚Äôt let him shoot haha
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"For sure, I think a lot of people saw CJ‚Äôs breakout coming, just didn‚Äôt expect it to be so rapid, following a relatively pedestrian second year.    But yeah, the potential was always there, he was a lottery pick for a reason. While the Duke upset gets a lot of attention, he was a beast from the jump. In 2010, he was named to the Sporting News NCAA All-Freshman Second Team. The first team featured John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Favors, Derrick Williams, and Xavier Henry. On the second team, CJ was joined by Kawhi Leonard, Hassan Whiteside, Alec Burks, and Elias Harris. Making that list was clearly a strong predictor of future success."
"&gt;None of those things make him a good coach. Lakers fans were also complaining about him for a long time. He had a bad roster then too.  Lots of Laker fans are dumber than rocks, too.  &gt;The warriors have very little beyond those 3. And one of them can't go on the court. It's not a good counter point.  Just like the Kings.  So if Walton is a bad coach, Kerr must be as well.  Surely Steph Curry and Draymond Green are worth 6 games.  Why is Wiseman getting worse each game?  Kerr must be an awful coach, right?  &gt;I think streakiness relates to coaching. Have you asked why they rely on streaky shooters? Is his coaching strategy, hope the shots go in?  They rely on streaky shooters because that's all they have.  Are you proposing that Walton should be utilizing Hassan Whiteside in the post more?  Do you think that's winning many games?  It's not.  &gt;Has he tried anything different after going on two 8 loss streaks? (I don't know)  You don't know lots of things, and should probably remain quiet.  They also won 7 of 8 twice, and have already won more games than just about anyone thought they would this season."
Full tweet  I want to congratulate Dwyane on his recent announcement. We had discussed having him join our ownership group after his retirement but he was not prepared to commmit at the time. Of course I am disappointed that he didn‚Äôt reconsider. 1/2  Having said that I wish him good luck and much success with the Jazz. To me Dwyane will always be a HEAT lifer. 2/2   My take:  I think Wade is still hurt that the Heat lowballed him and chose to let him walk in FA because they didn‚Äôt want to pay him and  instead chose to pay Hassan Whiteside a 4yr max contract and Tyler Johnson a 4yr 50 million deal that summer.  Mikey Arison has a lot of nerve calling Wade a heat lifer when they chose to pay Whiteside and Tyler Johnson over him. Wade mjst feel disrespected when he returned only to play on the bench while Josh Richardson and Winslow is starting over him
"&gt;Also side note, Shaq and Wade are both NBA analysts. Do you think they should be if they are owners of a team?  shaq makes fun of the kings all the time. just yesterday he was laughing at hassan whiteside"
Sacramento REALLY doesn't want to play Hassan Whiteside.
The Heat ruined their relationship with the face of their franchise because they wanted to pay Hassan Whiteside. LMAO

I am not here to defend Hassan Whiteside of all people but he did average a double-double...
Hassan Whiteside	22:54	12PTS	5-8	0-0	2-5	1ORB	8DRB	9REB	2AST	1	4blks	0TO	   What did y'all  say to him?
Hassan Whiteside = Bobby Boucher Jr
"Hassan Whiteside, Eric Bledsoe"
Hassan Whiteside
"Let‚Äôs put him up there with Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Andre Roberson, Hassan Whiteside, Avery Bradley and Andrew Bogut since were handing out flowers for SIXTH PLACE FOR DPOY."
hassan whiteside plays in the nba for cardio purposes and grabbing an occasional rebound that falls his way
"Yeah. Said it many times, but he's the Hassan Whiteside of SGs  You won't find emptier stats"
"He fouled out vs Dwight Howard.  He‚Äôs a pretty bad rebounder and gets beaten out by the rim runner type in addition to being embiids son.  If getting lots of blocks is your qualification for being a great defender, maybe you should also sign Hassan whiteside.  There‚Äôs a reason that he was offered free of charge to Boston and they turned him down. He‚Äôs not worth his contract whatsoever."
Hassan Whiteside
"Cannot believe Myles Turner got snubbed. Only 4 players have averaged more BPG than him since 2000. Theo Ratliff had a crazy 03-04 season, Serge Iblaka and Hassan Whiteside and then Ben Wallace. Dude didn‚Äôt even get second team with the 5th highest BPG average in 20 years.   For comparison, that‚Äôs like a player averaging over 30ppg and not making an all nba team."
"Hassan ""I'm just tryna get my NBA 2k rating up"" Whiteside. What a guy."
2020 blocks leader Hassan Whiteside also says hello
"They never became winners, but Hassan whiteside and Drummond are the biggest empty stats guys ever"
Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside beg to differ
Hassan Whiteside.   I agree like 98% of the time though.
"....yeah that's not how it went down at all.  Nerlens was trying to secure a big contract and was trying to do too much on the court.  He constantly was chasing blocks that he had no business going after (Think contract year Hassan Whiteside in a non-contract year) and Rick's system requires discipline for it work.  He started getting less play time because he was screwing up our already crappy defense.  He started being an all around drag on the team afterwards and just not giving a flying fuck about anything.  Hence the hot dog story where he went into the media room at half and grabbed a hot dog and said something like 'not like I'm going to play anyways.'  We would love the team-oriented player he became in New York, absolutely.  But let's not frame this as the Mavs were pissed he rejected their offer and said no more playing time for you!"
Lol it was a big miss that he thought Booker was a 3rd option but still it was the classic case of empty stats on a trash team especially because Booker was not very efficient. Some people like him and Trae excel in a winning environment as well and others end up like Hassan Whiteside and MCW  However to disregard all of his takes and call him a clown is very stupid
Hassan Whiteside was the worst for this
The very same exact reason why people think Hassan Whiteside is a good defender üò≠üòÇ
"Yeah that was brutal. We tried signing Hassan whiteside as well lol, but obviously he also turned us down."
Hassan Whiteside actually fixed his free throw shooting one year by just taking free throws like a mid-range jumper.
#ID TAKE HASSAN WHITESIDE OVER JOKIC AT THIS POINT
The fans would have probably voted trae young or Hassan whiteside
Or Hassan Whiteside who obviously just plays for the money
"Which are utter garbage. Hassan Whiteside led the league in blocks last year and is one of the worst defensive centers playing. He bites in every pump fake and falls behind every rotation but gets a lot of blocks because he's extremely aggressive. Hell KAT is almost always in the top 10 in blocks and his defense was laughable for almost his entire career.  Steals aren't as bad but they're pretty bad. Tj McConnell led the league in steals this year. Steph led the league multiple years in a row, Iverson Oladipo and Wall also did it. None of those guys are good defenders, most of them barely qualify as average."
"Athletic rim protectors are always up there in the lists tho, especially when they gotta fill a C spot. Hassan Whiteside was all defensive second team one of those years too‚Ä¶"
Definitely going to be a Hassan Whiteside type and fleece non contenders for 10+m a year
"Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan improved their fts by making their routines shorter. Anecdotal yeah, but could be something Giannis tries in the future."
Some real Hassan Whiteside vibes to him.
Have you seen Hassan Whiteside?
Kareem was a gluten free Hassan Whiteside.   /s
"This reminds me of the time I played pickup at LA Fitness with Hassan Whiteside and it was game point. He got the mismatch on me and dunked it for the game winner. I'm 5'6""."
‚ÄúHassan Whiteside vs Shaq vs Hakeem.‚Äù  That‚Äôs how dumb your question is lol.
"The Heat crowd didn't chant ""We Got Shooters"" at Hassan Whiteside for no reason.  Last year the media only paid attention to the Lakers, Clippers, and Bucks because they had Lebron, reigning Finals MVP, and reigning season MVP, and any combination of matchups led to juicy narratives."
Even though they just tried Hassan Whiteside
"Not if you turned around and gave that money to James Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Hassan Whiteside."
Good thing he paid Hassan Whiteside and James Johnson instead.
"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd praise him for going .500 against a team that was starting james Johnson, Tyler Johnson, and Hassan Whiteside but I mean the nets and the wizards are whatever"
"The Hassan Whiteside of shooting 3s, is what you‚Äôre saying."
In terms of advanced stats he's not amazing efficiency wise either. Lack of shots in the key and lack of free throws hurt him.  He's terrified of contact and always shoots those lame floaters tbh. The hassan Whiteside comparison was the best comparison for CJ that I've seen.
When are people going to realize this dude is actually the Hassan whiteside of SGs?  He's not fucking good man. He's not.   The only time he's ever been good in his entire fucking career was game 7 against them last year.
"To me, Drummond is not that much better than Hassan Whiteside. Their defensive impacts on court are hugely overrated."
"I think a lot of the sting surrounding Wade and his Miami exit comes from the fact that instead of paying Wade, they paid fucking Hassan Whiteside and Tyler Johnson instead. They both sucked, and choosing them over Wade was a mistake."
"&gt; To show how dumb it is to look at team record as an indication of a players ability.  I do believe you can build around KAT tho just Minnesota just been unlucky with injuries for the past two years. Detroit tried building around Drummond at it was a flop  &gt; I'm not saying you have to keep him, all I'm saying he isn't Shanghai Sharks material yet.  Yeah if Hassan Whiteside can still be in the league then drummond can too I guess I'll give you that"
Pretty good list. I might only add Hassan Whiteside.
Hassan Whiteside is up there
"Drummond has Hassan Whiteside written all over him.  Hassan filled in as the starting center last year in Portland and averaged 15.5/13.5/2.9, and we all thought some team would offer him 10 mil a year. Portland traded for Kanter and didn't even try to resign. He ended up with a vet min for the Kangs and couldn't even Crack their starting rotation."
"If Hassan Whiteside signed for the vet min, I don't see Drummond going for more than that."
"Hassan Whiteside  Truth is, the Trail Blazers can select any random 7 footer and they're going to average 10+ rebounds in limited time. See Enes Kanter averaging 11 in only 24 minutes a game this year."
I mean you could make the argument for almost every single all star deserving the MVP but I don‚Äôt think Booker deserved it just because of the metrics. He‚Äôs got a Mo Bamba and Hassan Whiteside level PER and while I do think you‚Äôve gotta take a stat that has JV ahead of Lebron with a grain of salt that‚Äôs pretty damning for who should‚Äôve been in the MVP convo.
Hassan Whiteside vs Effort
Man bring back Hassan Whiteside
"Kanter was a Celtic last year. We were using Nurk, Hassan Whiteside, and Wenyen Gabriel against the Lakers last year."
I agree but some fans said he‚Äôs like Hassan Whiteside with empty stats
he get abosultly killed in the P&amp;R though lol. blocks don't equal good defense or even average defense. I mean look at hassan whiteside
"so on par with the money Miami gives out to the players that overachieve with them?  *stares at Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, Tyler Johnson, Meyers Leonard....*"
He's at least trying in the Lakers. That's more than what you can say about Hassan Whiteside outside of his contract year in Miami.
CJ has been dreadful man. Sure his box score looks good but this dude is like the Hassan Whiteside of SGs  His defence is atrocious. Like really bad.
CJ is so fucking bad man. He's the hassan whiteside of SGs. I'm going to keep saying it; maybe eventually people will see  His stats are as empty as they come.
"Pat Riley doesnt get enough shit for his roster building/decision making. Year after year of giving the bank out to guys like james johnson, tyler johnson, dion waiters, hassan whiteside etc.... not giving up herro for harden. But butler went to them and bailed them out and their success last season all of their misses are/were forgotten. Honestly if the team wasnt in Miami they might still be a lottery team"
Rare? The dude gave Hassan Whiteside a max contract just a few years ago.
"Why is this considered rare?  Pat Riley overpaid James Johnson, Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside &amp; Tyler Johnson and his history of draft picks during that era wasn‚Äôt necessarily good either."
"Nicolas Batum (Hornets): Five years, $120,000,000  Hassan Whiteside (Heat): Four years, $98,419,537  Chandler Parsons (Grizzlies): Four years, $94,438,524  Ryan Anderson (Rockets): Four years, $80,000,000  Allen Crabbe (Trail Blazers): Four years, $74,832,500  Joakim Noah (Knicks): Four years, $72,590,000  Luol Deng (Lakers): Four years, $72,000,000  Kent Bazemore (Hawks): Four years, $70,000,000  Evan Turner (Trail Blazers): Four years, $70,000,000  Bismack Biyombo (Magic): Four years, $68,000,000  Ian Mahinmi (Wizards): Four years, $64,000,000  Timofey Mozgov (Lakers): Four years, $64,000,000"
&gt; CJ's the guard version of Hassan Whiteside  That's so harsh. I'm not the biggest fan of McCollum because he does have some flaws that are made worse specifically with the team makeup of the Blazers but Hassan Whiteside is a bit too harsh for me. Get that it's rough after losing this game though so I guess no one is gonna have level-headed takes rn.
&gt; CJ's the guard version of Hassan Whiteside  Jesus christ
"We just need to trade CJ for a forward + get a coach that isn't awful   That's really it.   CJ's the guard version of Hassan Whiteside, and Stotts is a poor man's Bud"
Somehow hassan Whiteside is worse
TL;DR: eye test confirms the stats. Empty stats is not just because a player is putting up numbers on a bad team. You have to watch the player play to see if the stats or empty or not.   Source: heat fan watching Hassan Whiteside.
"Portland had a lot more issues. Nurkic alone missed 66 games, let alone Rodney Hood tearing his Achilles (and missing half the season), Trevor Ariza missing half the season, Zach Collins missed nearly the entire season, etc  I mean their starting frontcourt for most of the season was Kent Bazemore, Carmelo Anthony, and Hassan Whiteside and they still managed to make the playoffs."
"If you think Drummond is good I have a slightly used Hassan Whiteside to sell you  Good stats, but everything else pretty much sucks"
Hassan whiteside exists
"can we stop acting like Drummond was ever anything except Hassan Whiteside 2.0   he got traded for a 2nd round pick, no GM values him"
My understanding is he's bad at defending the pick and roll and that's why no one wants to pay him ala.  Hassan Whiteside.
I see Drummond still can't cover the pick and roll. He's going to end up like Hassan Whiteside if he's not careful.
Next Hassan whiteside
No max contact Hassan whiteside isn‚Äôt winning mvp
"Lol excuse me? The last time we played you we started al faruoq aminu, moe harkless, and Meyers Leonard.   Last year we made the playoffs with a team whose 3rd, 4th, and 5th most minutes being Hassan whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and anfernee simons(who was arguably the worst player in the league last year)   Look at those world beaters! Not to mention you had a top 5 defense lol. You trying to tell me g leaguers did that? Or you think Steph carried that defense"
You can find a good center for a minimum contract like Hassan whiteside remember how cheap you guys got McGee for. You don‚Äôt need a back to the basket center to win in the nba you need one who can catch lobs and protect the rim. Wiseman does have a crap ton of upside but the warriors can win the title next year with Beal Curry Green Klay Wiggins and signing a minimum contract center who can rim protect and catch lobs
"Hassan Whiteside, Old man melo, Anthony Toliver, Mario Herzonja, Bazemore, and shot chucking CJ. i could go on"
gobert been having a historic season as far as advanced stats go defensively. blocks are not a great indicator of defensive success (see hassan whiteside).   clarkson has been the spark plug on the team with the best record in the NBA. d rose has been great but he doesn‚Äôt stack up against clarkson even if you only look at stats.
"You misunderstood everything I said. For Jokic, it‚Äôs purely basketball. That‚Äôs his job. He‚Äôs not in it for the fame like a lot of guys are. Hassan Whiteside was talking about his 2k rating after games, he loved basketball because he was good at it and it could get him attention. What commercial is Jokic in, what shoe deal does he have, what exclusive prime time interview does he give? He plays basketball and that‚Äôs it. You act like I said he‚Äôs not committed to getting better, that‚Äôs literally the opposite of what I meant. All he cares about is his game, not the other luxuries that comes with being a superstar.  There‚Äôs a baseball player, Zach Greinke, who said when Covid started he was happy fans weren‚Äôt in the stands because he didn‚Äôt have to interact with them and do autograph‚Äôs and stuff. Some players are just not into the extras. They just wanna play and go home."
Hassan Whiteside had an ORTG of 125 last season. so he was just as good as Dame? Kanter has an ORTG this season of 133 to Dame's 125. is Kanter better than Dame?
"Bro, Portland literally had Hassan Whiteside as their #3 piece. Please don't tell me Portland would've been fine without Dame, that team was straight ass without him there bailing them out with clutch shot after clutch shot. They didn't even have a small forward and had role players starting."
"I can cherry pick stats too!   Dame- 8 assists, 2.9 turnovers. 2.76 assist/turnover ratio. gets to the freethrow line 7.8 times per game. 1st in the league in clutch shots (with 1 minute left). 27.0 PER  Curry- 5.8 assists, 3.4 turnovers. 1.71 assists/turnover ratio. gets to the freethrow line 6.3 times per game. 26.4 PER  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Dame wasn‚Äôt close  Don't be ridiculous. Curry had the better season but Dame wasn't far off. You can just look at pts and %s but there is more to the game than that, for example your ability to draw fouls. Also I'd argue that Blazers team was just as bad as this Warriors team. Dame had just CJ with freaking Hassan Whiteside as their #3 piece because Nurkic was out for the season. The Warriors have Draymond Green (DPOY) and Wiggins. I'd say that's pretty close."
Giannis moves slightly closer to the Hassan Whiteside end of the player mentality scale instead of the Kevin Durant side.
there's only 2 degrees between IT and Moses Brown lol. Hassan Whiteside for Kings/Blazers
"LOL.   Top 10 in Mins played on Blazers last season: CJ then Dame, Hassan Whiteside, Melo, Anfernee Simons, Gary Trent, Baze, Hezonja, Ariza, Hood  Top 10 in mins played on Warriors this season: Wiggins then Curry, Dray, Oubre, Baze, Looney, JTA, Damion Lee, Jordan Poole, Wiseman  That's Dame with a supporting cast that has a 22ppg guy in CJ, then secondary scoring from Melo, Hood, Whiteside, Ariiza all average &gt;10ppg  This season Curry had only Wiggins, Oubre, Poole, Wiseman average &gt;10ppg  Lillard did a crazy carry last season but still Curry this season has been a few levels ahead."
You're using 2020 Hassan Whiteside as your argument that Portland had a decent team?
Anthony davis pulled an hassan whiteside got paid then started on playing like ass
Hassan Whiteside wasn't on top of all the defensive metrics for protecting the rim and watching him outside of that one Heat year never gave the impression that he's a good defender.
Ah the Hassan Whiteside special
Hassan Whiteside lead the league in blocks twice but I read some criticism of his defense at the time because he was biting on pump fakes and doing what you mentioned.
&gt;Goaltending Violations - James Wiseman  Surprised this isn't Hassan Whiteside. I guess he didn't play enough this season.
Just like Hassan Whiteside dominating blocks and rebounds stats at times. Pure greatness...
This guy thinks Andre Drummond/Hassan Whiteside should get large deals in FA according  to his BORG model.  I think I‚Äôll take a pass on what he has to say  (Although thanks for your vote on Lillard for first team NBA)
I've never seen Wilt Chamberlain play either but I know he's better than Hassan Whiteside lmao. What's your point?
Not on a max contract though. He has Hassan Whiteside syndrome. Give me a reasonable contract and I'll gladly take the downsides with the upsides.
"If somebody asked me the kind of stat line he‚Äôd put up if he got 35 minutes of garbage time, 34/14/0 with 23 FGA and 3 turnovers would be just about exactly on the money.  This dude is a bucket and an elite shooter but goddamn is he a Hassan Whiteside-level passer."
"Lol it‚Äôs been Andre Drummond the last 3 years, then Hassan Whiteside the year before that then Andre Drummond again the year before whiteside."
"Hassan Whiteside doesn‚Äôt get much playing time on a bad Kings team, but would have killed it with the Raptors"
I like how 3 players just watched him to get to the rim after he got past his man. If you consider Wenyen Gabriel was playing a decent chunk of minutes for the Blazers against the Lakers in the playoffs last year (as did Hassan Whiteside)... it's a miracle the Blazers even took a game.
"Versus the other All-Regret Team hailing from the summer of 2016, which is almost too many players to list.  Mozgov  Parsons  Evan Turner  Luol  Biyomobo  Crabbe  The blazers were probably the most egregious, since they either signed or attempted to sign a boatload of crappy players all over the course of a single off season. Signed Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless, and Meyers Leonard, and also tried their best to sign Hassan Whiteside, Chandler Parsons, and Pau Gasol."
Hassan Whiteside?
Hassan Whiteside best defender in the league
"Even the most biased eyes are better than metrics that consider Hassan Whiteside, Andre Drummond and Russell Westbrook to be elite defenders"
Hassan Whiteside with 27 points on 10/12 shooting. It was a different time to be a Heat fan back then.
"No, CJ actually is the problem  He's the Hassan Whiteside of SGs. Maybe he wouldn't be on another team, you're right, but that's what he's been his entire career  Inefficient volume scorer that completely and utterly wilts against anyone good in the playoffs (like legit sub 50% TS% over and over and over) while being a selfish player than can't play defense.   You can't be a guy that does nothing but score while also being a ridiculously inconsistent scorer.   We win against the Nuggets if he just doesn't play. He was legitimately that bad. Worst player in the entire first round from an impact standpoint   Look at this shit. It's embarrassing. There were 3 outliers, and two of them are blazers, just in opposite directions.   https://twitter.com/NBA_Math/status/1400808305086271495/photo/1"

"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
"If Beal hits free agency the Wizards lose almost all of their leverage. In a sign-and-trade the Wizards wouldn't get Brown back. Look back at the Jimmy Butler deal, again - Miami is capped, Butler chooses them, what Miami trades out is Josh Richardson and Hassan Whiteside. In this case, Butler is a better player than Beal, Richardson is a less valuable player than Smart, and Whiteside was getting paid more than Horford. Philly only got Richardson back."
I have the same theory about Hassan Whiteside
"Absolutely. The top guys not in the closing lineup before the trade deadline were Marvin Bagley, Hassan Whiteside, and Corey Joseph.  Barnes was the only wing on the roster for months. He led the team in minutes, guarded the opponent's best player most nights, and was our late-clock option. I don't know how he's still alive."

"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
"Ok let‚Äôs see how who did it against. Hassan whiteside, PJ tucker, Jokic and an injured bam. HISTORIC 28/10 on those elite defenders wow"
"I feel like it makes sense. Same draft as Hassan Whiteside, 3 months older than Whiteside."
Best doesn‚Äôt mean GOAT. Otherwise Hassan Whiteside would be above Bill Russell in the standings
"No Hassan whiteside hunts blocks even if it‚Äôs detrimental to his team.  Barnes is legit, doesn‚Äôt play stupid risky defence, is a great communicator, plays on the perimeter pretty well"
Do raptors feel his defense will translate well into the nba. Or are we getting a Hassan Whiteside situation. Not hating but there have been many defensive prospects that just don't pan out when defending nba players
"Hassan Whiteside is a good NBA player.  Jaylen Brown is better than Tatum.  Russell Westbrook makes the Lakers worse, Dennis + KCP + Kuzma is more value  DeAndre Ayton can potentially be the best center in the NBA by 2025"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

You can get a guy like Hassan Whiteside or Alex Len on a bargain-bin contract that can do the same things, but they're only going to be good for soaking up regular season minutes because they'll be exploited in the playoffs.   If you want a center that won't be trash in the playoffs, you'll have to pay more than bottom-of-the-barrel."

that was really it for his career too... I don't think he was ever a positive player as a starter again after that season. Then he was just someone who'd get roasted defensively and could only school young bench bigs and Hassan Whiteside.

Hassan Whiteside is another answer in a similar vein.
You think everyone would've figured it out the year we lost 4/5 starters and Dame still carried us to the playoffs.  Or maybe the year we started Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside and still made it.

"These players get more overrated the farther you go back in time   If you have a time machine, take Hassan whiteside to the NBA in the 1960‚Äôs, then he‚Äôd be regarded as one of the best of all time"
"Hassan ""Macaulay Culkin"" Whiteside"
the fact that hassan whiteside is still alive suggests that‚Äôs false
"Woj literally reported the deal was Ingram a first and loul deng (a negative asset who we‚Äôd have to take back as a salary filler). Spurs wanted more and the Lakers said no. Sure you can argue that in hindsight Ingram and a first is a good deal, but DeRozan, Poeltl and a first was an even better deal at that time.    Kawhi had no value because he tanked it. The other offers the Spurs had were from the Celtics who didn‚Äôt offer sophomore Brown or rookie Tatum. The sixers who wouldn‚Äôt even offer Markelle fultz, the Heat whose ‚Äúgod father‚Äù offer was centered around Hassan whiteside and Josh Richardson, and the Clippers whose deal was an expiring Tobias Harris and a lottery pick.  Kawhi was out the previous year with a quad and knee injury his team tried to debunk, was on an expiring deal, and had a camp that threatened teams with the possibility of him sitting out another year, and made it known he was going to go to Los Angeles which lead to no teams wanting to give up anything of value."
Hassan whiteside
Hey at least our GOAT didn‚Äôt walk away because our front office treated him like dogshit so they could pay Hassan Whiteside and Tyler fucking Johnson. Hope you have fond memories of Wade on Chicago and Cleveland though.
"Wild take I think players like TJ McConnell, Mikel Bridges, Hassan Whiteside would work really well in the Olympic team"
Hassan Whiteside is the only one who has the talent. Yep.
One less than hassan whiteside
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call keeping your team together and adding Gay/Whiteside/Paschall ‚Äúkilling it‚Äù. None of those guys are impact players.      Also Hassan Whiteside is older than the aging Derrick Favors.
"Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall and Hassan Whiteside are great replacements for Niang and Favors minutes, I like it. Not to mention the Donovan-Paschall connection."
"Hassan Whiteside: Led league in blocks, good rebounder, nice stats.  Andre Drummond: Led league in rebounding, nice stats.  Enes Kanter: Good finisher under the basket, nice stats.  Future centers wanting to be in demand and earn serious dollars need to work on being a floor spacer, dual threat in passing/defense, and learn how to get shooters wide open whether it is the p&amp;r, screens, etc., If you're just a center who can only get your own opportunities, you're basically a vet minimum player."
&gt;Hassan Whiteside: contract \~$2M/yr - fair market value \~$13M/yr - difference \~$11M/yr  That is why I don't trust AI  Edit: I don't watch enough of the rest to make an educated estimate of their value but Hassan shouldn't even be in the league. He's lucky to get a min contract
Hassan whiteside ?? 13m $?  Lol
"The Jazz have to be up there, went from paying Favors 9M to paying Whiteside the vet min and IMO is an upgrade, I think Hassan is a better player today.  Rudy Gay is an upgrade over Niang  Jared Butler was a steal  Ryan Smith has shown he‚Äôs willing to be a tax payer"
Hassan Whiteside in shambles...
"&gt;If I hear ‚Äúempty stats player‚Äù from a person who has not watched Hassan Whiteside play  How about from someone who did watch him play ?  How about from someone who was against the Heat giving him those 90M in the first place, when everyone else called me crazy ?  Someone who was also against paying: Tyler Johnson and Dion Waiters, and who was only ok with paying James Johnson for 2 reasons: reward him for the crazy season he had with the Heat and to have a large contract that you can throw in a trade for a star.  &gt;great at altering shots and grabbing rebounds.  By chasing blocks and rebounds, he's often out of position defensively, which opens up layups and dunks for the opposing team.  **But I guess it was Hassan's defensive prowess why the Blazers were \[checks notes\] 28th our of 30 in defensive rating.**  This take is so bad you're not even worth being called a nephew. You're like a Chris Broussard or something."
https://blogs.herald.com/miami_heat/2016/01/did-gobert-fournier-and-vucevic-share-an-inside-joke-about-hassan-whiteside-on-twitter.html
"Hassan Whiteside would've been such a great center if he just focused on his role man. Elite rebounder and shot blocker, he has proven that."
Now we really get to see if Rudy is just Hassan Whiteside on max.
I have watched Hassan Whiteside when he was on the Heat.  Didn't watch him that much when he was on Portland and with the Kings admittedly.    He alters shots but also gambles a ton to get blocks which leads to easier shots at the rim.    He's also out of position a lot so he's not in position to alter shots.  He's also not a good pick and roll defender.
"Would you care if someone showed the best players in 2019-2020 by PER but included people who didn't have the minutes qualification and then said that based on that that it wouldn't be ludicrous for the all-NBA First Team to be Shamorie Ponds, Jamal Crawford, Max Strus, Jonathan Motley, and Tacko Fall?? All with 28+ PER!!!!  Hell, even just among qualified players, Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond made it into the top 20."
"I still think it‚Äôs a smart signing though, words I never expected to type about Hassan Whiteside."
"If I hear ‚Äúempty stats player‚Äù from a person who has not watched Hassan Whiteside play is fucking ridiculous man. Whiteside was the best player on a Heat Team that was going to go to the ECF before Whiteside got injured in Game 5, a bunch of parrots on this website man.  Whiteside is an efficent scorer, and great at altering shots and grabbing rebounds."
"Hassan Whiteside went from a min contract to a max contract with Miami, then back to a min contract with the Kings. Only player to ever go from min to max to min."
defensive anchor Hassan whiteside
"Ahh, the ole Hassan Whiteside promise"
I'd even be fine with Hassan Whiteside at this point
He's the next generations version of Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Fantasy Beast tho
Top remaining centers:    Ed Davis	  Enes Kanter  Frank Kaminsky	  Hassan Whiteside	  Willy Hernangomez	  Isaiah Hartenstein	  DeMarcus Cousins
It‚Äôs been shocking at times how easily we can dump a bad contract. Hassan Whiteside being the most obvious example but there have been so many examples over the last ten years where it looked like it came out of nowhere.

"Lmao sure bro. We were paying Hassan Whiteside, James Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Tyler Johnson big money and just a few years later we won the Eastern Conference. Not every franchise has an incompetent front office that can‚Äôt recover from a couple swings and misses"
I get what you‚Äôre saying but would‚Äôve just rather paid our franchise GOAT instead of Hassan Whiteside
"Ok but compare the 2020-21 warriors roster to the 2019-2020 Blazers roster and it‚Äôs not even close. Draymond, Wiggins, and Oubre vs CJ McCollum, Hassan Whiteside, and Melo. The Blazers played Mario Hezonja and Anthony Tolliver substantial minutes all year due to injuries to Nurkic and Collins. Yet despite all of this, the blazers still made the playoffs by beating the same Grizzlies team that the Warriors lost to in the 2021 play-in. Dame 2020 carry job &gt;&gt;&gt; Steph 2021 carry job. And I know I‚Äôll get downvoted because warriors fans can‚Äôt take anything that even remotely criticizes Curry, but I don‚Äôt care because I said nothing but facts. Check the rosters that both players dealt with and you‚Äôll see."
Hassan Whiteside 2.0: Electric Bugaloo
Why would they want another Hassan Whiteside?
Andre ‚ÄúHassan Whiteside‚Äù Drummond
"You know, the immediate downvote and ‚ÄúOH YEAH‚Äù attitude doesn‚Äôt really make me feel wrong about the ‚Äúhomer‚Äù thing.  And even ignoring my local FOX station used to split NBA games between Thunder and Wolves:  he doesn‚Äôt body up well, he‚Äôs jumpy as hell, for some reason tries to strip the ball on dribble drives while also backing up, gets lost and/or stagnant depending on the drive, and just about every statistical measure of rim protection outside of just basic blocking stats.   Like, he ~~and Hassan Whiteside~~ can get highlight blocks, so you can save the highlight reel as you don‚Äôt show stats beyond saying they exist."
"&gt;Favouring the development of Alen Smailigaic, younger versions of Hassan Whiteside and Stanley Johnson instead of trying to contend while Steph is in his prime is malpractice.  Lmfao, people really have no idea what they're talking about."
"Focousing on the development of Alen Smailigaic, young Hassan Whiteside and Stanley Johnson instead of trying to contend while Steph is in his prime is malpractice."
He‚Äôs the next Hassan Whiteside
The black Hassan Whiteside
Oh like Hassan Whiteside or Damian Jones?
I remember choosing the king's as my team after not having followed basketball for about 10 years.   I stopped claiming them when they signed Hassan Whiteside as a free agent. That front office literally might be run by an intern simulating shit on 2k
"Jimmy Butler trade:  July 6, 2019: As part of a 4-team trade, traded by the Philadelphia 76ers to the Miami Heat; the Los Angeles Clippers traded cash to the Miami Heat; the Miami Heat traded a 2023 1st round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Miami Heat traded Josh Richardson to the Philadelphia 76ers; the Miami Heat traded Hassan Whiteside to the Portland Trail Blazers; the Philadelphia 76ers traded Mathias Lessort to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Portland Trail Blazers traded Maurice Harkless to the Los Angeles Clippers; and the Portland Trail Blazers traded Meyers Leonard to the Miami Heat. $110K (top-14 protected)  76ers trade both Jimmy Butler and Mathias Lessort.  Next time don't be so adamant you're right and be an asshole about it, especially trying to use text that doesn't mean what you think it means as justification."
"The Heat were able to get the best out Hassan Whiteside, so we'd get plenty of Heat culture takes."
"I doubt it. Is he that much better than Hassan Whiteside? Because Hassan essentially started for a while year on the blazers and even put up decent numbers,  but ended up with a VET MIN contract on the Kangs last summer.   Drummond's upcoming free agency has Whiteside written all over it."
"It‚Äôs not the least important part because you‚Äôre implying that Myles gets most of his 3s as a spot up shooter. In reality, he gets most of his 3s on pick and pops. That‚Äôs an important distinction because it changes the way teams have to defend the Pacers in high screen situations. Myles gravity as a shooter in PnP situations is a big reason why the pacers had a top 10 offense with a heavy reliance on PnR without a true go-to scorer.   You said other dumb stuff too like comparing Hassan Whiteside, a notoriously bad PnR defender to Myles who has developed into an excellent PnR defender and versatile help defender. If you watch the pacers you know that part of the reason his rebound numbers are low is because he is capable of switching and defending on the perimeter.   Myles is flawed for sure and I‚Äôm not opposed to trading him. But your criticisms of him are just way off the Mark."
"The best ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù that wanted to come to Miami in a decade has been Jimmy. I love a Jimmy but there‚Äôs been much better options available.  Do you not remember the awful contracts we had to give out cuz nobody else would sign for us? Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Hassan whiteside?"
heat culture is signing hassan whiteside to a max deal and trading for 38 year old iguodala
Why not get a guy like Hassan Whiteside? I get he‚Äôs a bum but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs available and protects the paint well.
"&gt; Josh Richardson was acquired by the Philadelphia Sixers in exchange for Jimmy Butler and the draft rights to Mathias Lessort. Hassan Whiteside was acquired by the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Maurice Harkless and Meyers Leonard. Maurice Harkless, the draft rights to Mathias Lessort and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own) were acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for cash. Jimmy Butler, Meyers Leonard and cash were acquired by the Miami Heat in exchange for Josh Richardson, Hassan Whiteside and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own)."
"Shoutout NC  PG: Chris Paul, Devontae Graham   SG: Steph Curry, Seth Curry  SF: Brandon Ingram, TJ Warren  PF: PJ Tucker, Montrezl Harrell  C: Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside"
Think we all wish the Bulls saga never happened. Sucked to see him go in favor of Hassan Whiteside
"Nah, but he can be Hassan Whiteside"
"I‚Äôd propose a three way trade with the Pelicans to bring in Brandon Ingram for Randle and a pick, send Lonzo and a couple picks to Portland, and Derrick Rose to NO. Then I‚Äôd try to sign a guy like Hassan Whiteside or Derrick Jones Jr in free agency."
Hassan Whiteside and wood have play styles that are nothing alike...wood can‚Äôt be played off the floor like Whiteside can
I think Wood is gonna end up being a Hassan Whiteside type player. I don‚Äôt believe in him.  I also think Siakam peaked a long time ago.  Likely unpopular but that‚Äôs my opinion.
Not a total bust but Hassan Whiteside just
"Hassan Whiteside, lord of Snapchat."
It was a trade but also lol at calling 2019 Hassan Whiteside a big free agent
"Not a 1 year deal... Hassan Whiteside signed a 2 year minimum deal with the Heat, had a breakout contract year and got 4/98M."
"just like Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson..."
Clarkson is so bad this year that Hassan Whiteside is outplaying him.

&gt; 2016 Hassan whiteside was the best rim protector in the league and would be able to counter GSW death lineup offensively.
"To me KD and Lebron is a wash. I‚Äôll take 2010 D Wade over Steph who has underperformed in finals(Kyrie outplayed steph all series in 2016). 2016 Hassan whiteside was the best rim protector in the league and would be able to counter GSW death lineup offensively. Dragic turns into a spot up shooter in lebron‚Äôs offense. I think KD and Steph would develop some sort of ‚Äúyour time, my turn‚Äù flow in 4th quarter, and KD goes for big games as Miami doesn‚Äôt have many bodies to throw at him/make it tough for him. Miami has a deeper bench with Abedayo, Chalmers, Ray Allen, Winslow, Johnson, etc.  I see GSW as the slight favorites on paper but MIA winning it in 7."
Miami was desperately looking for a passable center for four years during the Heattles era. LeBron leaves and out of nowhere Hassan Whiteside produces an All-Defensive season.
"Idk man, some of the games I've watched he looks like Hassan Whiteside out there on defense.  Only interested if he's directly involved in the play."
Hassan Whiteside
Hassan Whiteside ‚Ä¶..
"Hassan Whiteside, always hated the narrative of him being an underdog story when he‚Äôs fucking 7ft tall, ripped, but zero offensive skills or and it took him years to stick in the league after being drafted"
I was at that game. Tickets were so insanely cheap I couldn't not. Dame still put up like 40 but Hassan Whiteside couldn't be stopped in taking down his own team.
Doc Rivers basically made DeAndre's entire career.  He went from being a poor man's Hassan Whiteside that Vinny Del Negro refused to play in 4th quarters to a serviceable defensive 5 that did fairly well within the limited role he was given.  He was never actually elite on defense but enough people bought into the Doc Rivers hype and rebounding stats that he got accolades and a very questionable All Star appearance.  Prime DeAndre Jordan was basically like a version of Drummond that rarely if ever tried to play outside of his role.  His game was never going to age well as long as his offensive skills were limited and he had to rely heavily on having super elite athleticism.  He started to check out mentally towards the end of his Clippers tenure and has basically been a negative asset for every other team he's joined.  You might five or six games a season in which he's willing to hustle and make the requisite effort on defense.
He‚Äôs Hassan whiteside
"Dude how much have you watched him play? Bagley sucks so much. His touch is awful, he literally can't use his right hand so he forces everything to his left, his assists are worse than Hassan Whiteside, he usually demands the ball with his back to the basket about 18 feet from the rim and lacks the moves to drive because his jumper is whack and no one takes it as a threat, he can't back people down because he's not strong like full size centers, he can't finish consistently around 10 ft from basket either, he demands the ball to put up absolute bricks because he's never looking for an open man, his 3 pt shooting isn't scaring anyone, he has shitty hands and easily gets stripped in the block, and he doesn't set real screens to top it all off, so he isn't even getting open for lobs.  Bagley's game is entirely predicated on cleaning up sloppy shots and out double jumping his opponents, but that isn't worth it when it also comes with absolutely braindead help defense and shitty man on defense.  He is a net negative through and through. He might have success in Macedonia next year where he can body smaller guys though."
"Hassan whiteside punched embiid with his balls, that defo connected"
Hassan Whiteside has never been fantasy relevant save for maybe 2 seasons and one he was a waiver pickup
Hall of Fame is not decided by Fantasy otherwise Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside would be all-time greats what kinda logic did you just use
The first players I think of are Hassan Whiteside &amp; Andre Drummond.
"Hassan Whiteside finishes with double-doubles off the bench for the vet minimum.  The backup C the Jazz have needed. Tony Bradley, Ed Davis, and D Favs (love him though) weren‚Äôt cutting it."
"Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Hassan Whiteside, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson, and Clint Capela for the 3 pt contest"
"That's not how sign and trades work, otherwise Miami wouldn't have gotten Jimmy Butler for Hassan Whiteside and Josh Richardson"
"&gt;His roll gravity is what opens up our shooters. Without him, nothing we do works.  Hassan Whiteside has a +67 +/- while on the floor in 245 minutes this season. Gobert is at +78 in 462 minutes."
"here's who did it each season...  2021: Micheal Porter Jr.   2020: John Collins, TJ Warren, Hassan Whiteside\* (\*shot 0.1 3PA per game so shouldn‚Äôt count)   2019: Malcolm Brogdon   2018: KAT   2017: No One   2016: Kawhi Leonard   2015: No One   2014: No One"
Hassan Whiteside is hilarious..and occasionally hilariously bad
Am I the only one who thought ‚ÄúHassan whiteside with a jump shot‚Äù sounds pretty fucking good?
At least Hassan Whiteside was a big time shot blocker. Christian wood is not that.
Wood is one of the most overrated players in the league. He's hassan whiteside with a jump shot
"Let's just say out of Alex Len, Hassan Whiteside, Damian Jones, and Chimezie Metu, he's easily the worst"
"&gt; Your translation is bias lol, so it means nothing, just like your username.   1. The word is ‚Äúbiased‚Äù 2. Throwing in a username insult in the very first sentence is not how adults act, so I guess that‚Äôs my baseline for this interaction.   &gt; I swear curry fans are so sensitive, you view anything other than praise as an attack lol.   There‚Äôs no requirement to be a fan of a player to comment about them. Interesting that you immediately jump to ‚Äúmust be a stan‚Äù as a defense. Projection is so interesting.   FWIW I‚Äôm not a ‚ÄòCurry fan‚Äô. I like basketball.   &gt; It's not a misleading narrative, I'm simply reporting raw stats and comparing the same category.   I doubt you realize it, but you‚Äôre arguing against yourself when you talk about ‚Äúsimply reporting raw stats‚Äù.   In literally any sport with advanced analytics, people use advanced stats because raw stats provide an incomplete and misleading view of players‚Äô impacts.   The difference is that you actively *want* that incomplete and misleading view‚Ä¶which is why you‚Äôre stuck with the boomer argument that FG% is more accurate than TS%.   &gt; You're btrying to create a narrative that curry was actually efficient by strictly relying on advanced stats lol. But that's too hard for you nephews to understand.  Just say you don‚Äôt understand what ‚Äòefficiency‚Äô means and move on.   &gt; I said I needed a fair comparison for two different types of players.   So why did you choose the stat - FG% - that does the exact opposite? Actions speak louder than words.   Comparing an interior scorer to a perimeter scorer using FG% is the opposite of how this works. **TS% was LITERALLY created because FG% disproportionately favors people who score around the basic and fails to accurately capture the impact of perimeter scorers.** I can‚Äôt believe I have to point that out. Anyone who follows basketball at all knows this.   Just for fun - would you say that Hassan Whiteside is more efficient from the field than LeBron? after all, Whiteside has a higher FG%. Clearly Whiteside must be more efficient from the field than LeBron‚Ä¶right? Would be interested in hearing the counter to this.   &gt; And the result is that they missed a similar number of field goals, not that different in efficiency  Here‚Äôs a hypothetical: two players go 5/10 from the floor.   - One makes five threes - One makes five dunks  Who is a more efficient scorer?"

You should look at advanced metrics like on/off, line up data, and offensive and defensive stats to see how someone is doing. Like if you just look at points assist rebound and shooting percentage you probably think prime Hassan Whiteside is a great player and is much better then someone like Igudala on the warriors from 2015-2018, but in reality Igudala is a much better player and contributes much more to winning"
"You just described Hassan Whiteside in your post, which is hilarious because it's painfully obvious how much the Jazz defense suffers when Whiteside subs in for Gobert."
I mean there‚Äôs a reason Hassan Whiteside has never won DPOY. He basically makes the rim a no go for a large portion of possessions
Not sure what you're trying to say bro. Jokic is listed at 1inch shorter and 20 pounds heavier than hassan Whiteside... And that ain't muscle
"I hope Chuck sees it. His jokes are fine, not too harsh, but I‚Äôd want to see what he says here. Shows that we don‚Äôt always know the full story.   I have a newfound respect for AD. Man gets hurt a lot, I bet he‚Äôs a bit skittish about playing center full time because of it. Ultimately, he did in the 2020 playoffs and won us a ring. He doesn‚Äôt seem lazy or rude (like Miami Hassan Whiteside), I hope he gets it together.   I don‚Äôt know if he will be a Laker leader someday, but I truly believe he has the ability."
I thought it was gonna be Hassan whiteside and I‚Äôm surprised to say if I have to pick one it‚Äôs Jared Butler so far (who I also give a very long leash for being a rookie trying to figure it out)
Lmfao bro Christian Wood is just hassan whiteside with a 3 pt shot
TIL that Hassan Whiteside is still in the league
"This just in, Hassan Whiteside admits to hating every single person on the planet. Double negatives claim another victim."
"Hassan ""Contract year"" Whiteside"
"Depending on how you grade him, Hassan Whiteside+extras for Jimmy Butler. Heat fans hated that Whiteside contract."
Hassan Whiteside knows Spo is still his daddy even after all these years  Daddy got him paid
that's why the Jazz don't pass Gobert the ball. that was the most pathetic post up attempt I've ever seen  $40m+ player and has worse post moves than Hassan Whiteside
Welcome to the Hassan Whiteside experience
We call that the Hassan Whiteside.
"Yeah. You‚Äôve seen how Neil has his guys, seems to poach talent and coaches from the Clippers, and well - it should be over soon, maybe.  Hell, I would watch another season of Hassan Whiteside."
I thought Hassan Whiteside would be that on the jazz but damn he‚Äôs not bad
"AD is a weird defender, man.  If he locks in, he's incredible, but a lot of the times he looks like mid-contract Hassan Whiteside out there."
"Jazz injury report:  Donovan Mitchell,  Royce O'Neale  Hassan Whiteside  Rudy Gay  Jared butler   :/ feelsbadman"
Hassan Whiteside is playing wonderfully for us so far and is worth at least the vet min we signed him for.
"lol they added hassan whiteside, washed rudy gay, and eric paschall. at least 1-2 of them won't even be in the playoff rotation. + the jazz will never be real contenders with Gobert as their 2nd best player"
from who? eric paschall? hassan whiteside?
wtf hassan whiteside
48 Minutes of Rudy Gobert and Hassan Whiteside must seem like hell to opposing teams. So many guards just 'nope'ing out of drives this season.
Kanter's on a vet min my dude. He's got a lot of flaws but you can do a lot worse than him when he's getting paid pennies on the dollar.   Who else would you have? Bismack Biyombo? Hassan Whiteside?
"You're using blocks and steals as a measure of defense? Those 4 blocks and 2 steals tell you how **6** total possessions *ended*. The Lakers this season are averaging 108 possessions per game...  They don't even tell you if Melo played good defense all throughout those possessions, just that he had a couple of moments that stopped plays. They just say that the possession ended because Melo blocked a shot or stole the ball. Hassan Whiteside has averaged 4 blocks per game and was fucking terrible on defense. Allen Iverson averaged over 3 steals a game multiple times and was a fucking traffic cone.  Judging players by block and steal numbers shows that you don't know a damn thing about how defense actually works."
"Except it is exactly the same just shifted from failing to build around Cousins to failing to build around Fox. 3-4 key young players that have no other talent around them and a terrible coaching staff and an incompetent front office that has done such an awful job that no one in the NBA wants to play for SAC.  Front office just continually either overpays for completely washed (Hassan Whiteside last year, Tristan Thompson this year) big men or takes huge risks on drafting injury prone (Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley III) big men, or pays average role players as if they're stars (Harrison Barnes).   The argument could be made that they aren't focused on big men and are trying to emulate the small ball movement but that doesn't hold either cuz the small ball movement is predicated on good 3pt shooting and players that can defend multiple positions and Buddy Hield is the only good 3pt shooter on the roster and they don't have anyone that can guard more than 2 positions.   Throw in a coaching staff that doesn't even understand what defense is and has to bank on an undersized rookie PG to bail them out with his 1 on 1 ability and it will be another long wait for relevancy."
Not really shown from the stats but Hassan Whiteside has actually been great for the Jazz
"We also missed Nurk and CJ for half of last year, in what world is having to start Kanter and use Melo for bench minutes not going to create a bad defense regardless of the coach?  Also last year Terry wanted an actual backup PG and Neil refused to bring one in wanting Ant to get those minutes, this year, we have DSJ in that role and it is allowing Ant to flourish along with the team  Neil gutted the roster after he WCF finals run and then hyped the team up like it was somehow a title contending roster and that turned a lot of the fans on Terry but it was absolutely Neils shit roster  After that WCF season the team lost Seth Curry, Mo Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard (and then ten games into the next season Rodney Hood went down for the year)  and replaced those guys with: Hassan Whiteside, Mario Herzonjia, Anthony Tolliver, Nik Staukas, Kent Bazemore, Wenyen Garbiel and eventually Melo  and fans wanted to act like it was all on Terry and not on Neil, like c'mon"
Feels weird to say this but... I love Hassan Whiteside
"Idk about that lol, we were still the third best offense in the nba starting Hassan whiteside Carmelo and Trevor Ariza. Were the second best offense in the league last year missing both CJ and Nurk for 30 straight games.  Pretty sure you could walk dame out there with just anyone and it would be a top 10 offense"
People talked all summer that it was contract year and he was going to hassan Whiteside it
I watched mason Plumlee hit 10 corner threes in a row in warmups once   Also watched Hassan Whiteside splash down threes in warmups too but that one was less unexpected because he was a decent shooter in game when he was in Portland
Azuibuke is our raw big man prospect at 6‚Äô10‚Äù  Bojan is a 6‚Äô7‚Äù SF.  Rudy Gay is 6‚Äô8‚Äù.  Rudy Gobert is 7‚Äô1‚Äù.  Joe Ingles is 6‚Äô8‚Äù.  Hassan Whiteside is 7‚Äô.  We‚Äôre ok on size.
Hassan Whiteside
I love Hassan Whiteside and I don't care who knows it
I haven't heard much but Avery Bradley or DJ off the Rockets? Veterans who don't fit the Rockets' immediate future. I read somewhere that they're keeping Olynyk though.  Hassan Whiteside will be gone but I can see the Kings waiting for the offseason first.
"Why the hell would the Suns do that lol  Turner isn‚Äôt that good, honestly he‚Äôs overrated &amp; reminds me of the people who were raving about Hassan Whiteside cause he blocks a lot of shots"
Have you seen his Detroit tape? I would be saying the same thing if Hassan whiteside decided to go back to his Miami max contract form where he had multiple triple doubles WITH BLOCKS (!!!) after going to Portland.
"Yeah, literally exactly this post is what I‚Äôm talking about. ‚ÄúJokic posts up a lot too!‚Äù Sure, but he doesn‚Äôt have an *all-time level elite ability to force defenders into positions where fouling is the only course of action besides allowing a bucket.* My post doesn‚Äôt suggest he‚Äôs just big and strong. It suggests that he doesn‚Äôt have that particular all-time level skill that Embiid has the same way Embiid isn‚Äôt an all time playmaker.   Also, don‚Äôt rely on the classic ‚Äúah but you don‚Äôt watch the games so you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Thats a weak argument. I‚Äôm a 26 year old guy who lives alone, I watch league pass games 6 nights a week, lmao. I‚Äôve watched probably a hundred Jokic games over the past few seasons, and probably 15 or 20 this year. I know the player. Nobody said he‚Äôs all finesse.    It‚Äôs literally the point I was making - Nuggets fans continue to equate Embiids foul generation as ‚Äúplaying more bully ball.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just a generic playing bully ball like he‚Äôs Heat Hassan Whiteside. It‚Äôs a deliberate and intentional manipulation of the defenders position through footwork and dexterity. The idea that Jokic could do that at will and simply ‚Äúdoes it less‚Äù is extremely reductive of arguably the best skill of a generational talent.    E: and again, nobody is saying Jokic shouldn‚Äôt be getting more free throws. It‚Äôs a reputational thing that the refs are wrong about. There‚Äôs just no reason to include Embiid in the discussion. It‚Äôs like comparing Westbrook to Harden in the same conversation ‚Äî yes, Westbrook drives a lot, and should get a lot of fouls, but not like Harden, who has perfected the art of forcing defenders to foul."
"One thing I've learned watching DPOY ladders for years is that blocks get overrated. They always have. I know this as a Heat fan watching Hassan Whiteside. I'm not calling Myles Turner Hassan, but he's a great defender, not a top 3 candidate and his only argument really is blocks which is just something I know to ignore as a main argument for a players defensive ability. I just don't know how you can argue Myles is a more impactful defender than everybody but two players in the league. It's just so obvious blocks are leading this argument and I know to discount that. Yes Myles is great. But he's a top 15 defensive player. Not top 3"
What super star potential are you talking about? I don't see it. What does he have that Javale McGee or Hassan Whiteside don't have ?
* Javale basketball IQ  * Lambieer sportsmanship    * Hassan Whiteside body language  * Sprewell relationship with coach    * Odom knees  * Alexei Schved  mood  * Allen Iverson practice
you‚Äôd probably think Hassan Whiteside was a DPOY candidate
Hassan Whiteside
I remember an old coworker of mine tried to say Hassan Whiteside was MUCH better than Embiid and that Joel would be out of the league in 2 years due to injuries when Whiteside was still on the Heat
Yes because Dwight has understood his role   Hassan Whiteside hasn‚Äôt shown that he isn‚Äôt empty stats   One of them is playing a significant bench role on the best team in the East. The other is barely getting 15 minutes on a bad Kings team. That‚Äôs says a lot
"Did you watch our games this year? Sexton is our go-to scorer and he's way better at it than Drummond. Garland's better too. Nance and Love both are as well when there healthy. Sexton and Garland and Nance are all very strong facilitators as well. I mean, just the fact that you said that makes it clear you haven't watched any of our games this year, which means you haven't watched any of Drummond's games this year, which completely invalidates literally everything you said. He is solid at getting steals for a big, but he's not even the best stealing big on our team (that would be Nance). And steals per game and blocks per game are not measures of good defenders; Hassan Whiteside and Steph Curry have led the league in blocks and steals per game, respectively, and neither of them can guard a fence post. He didn't even run the pick and roll for us that much, so I have no idea where you're getting all of this from. Most of our shooting comes from Sexton slashing. I never said anything about Marc Gasol. I think he's not a stating level center in the league anymore. But I can tell you, having watched Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond each many, many times, that Tristan is a better player. You'll see once Drummond plays with the Lakers, since I assume you'll watch those games. He tricks people who only look at his box score. He's worth the contract the Lakers are paying him, but not much more."
Hassan Whiteside led the league in blocks for 2 seasons. Is he a good defender?
Wiseman's ceiling is Hassan Whiteside
"The answer is no. He's got awful decision making on offense right now and is a truly non-existent passer. Like Hassan whiteside levels of selfishness  He's got some nice scoring chops for sure (he can get himself decent looks from mid off the dribble) and is an  elite 3 point shooter, but he doesn't have anywhere near the athleticism or driving ability that Beal does. He's bad around the rim  His defense atm is also more show than anything. It looks good, but he's not actually a good defender. He can't switch onto bigger guys without getting abused and he's often overly aggressive leading to lots of blowbys. I think he'll end up being good defensively eventually though, simply due to effort   In spite of all that, he's going to be really good. He's got a fucking insane work ethic and the dudes got that russell westbrook I'm gonna murder you type attitude.   He's just not going to be beal"
"1. Assists is not the sole defining measure of a PG. Who would be your ideal backup PG?  2. Our bench unit bricks a lot of shots. How many FGs are made by Mavs while Luka is off court?  3. Brunson is a 2018 2nd round pick who has only started getting regular time this season. IIRC, his primary position was always PG.  4. When Brunson plays alongside Luka, he takes SG role. How many minutes does he get to play PG? Won't that decline further in playoffs?  5. If Brunson hasn't improved, why would Mavs trade away Delon Wright?    --‚Äê-------------‚Äê-------------------------  I don't think Dwight was available to us. 76ers were supposed to be prime contenders with Harden coming in as well. Dwight chose them to get another ring.  Even WCS, despite his limitations, declined his option and got extra money from us. Isn't Hassan Whiteside playing on a vet minimum contract for Kings? Would you rather have Whiteside over WCS?"
"Backup PG =&gt; Brunson  Consistency =&gt; Too vague so I don't know what you mean by that  Rebounding =&gt; Who should we trade for? Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capela , Enes Kanter , Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson?  I suppose we should offer their current team all our first round picks and give them a max contract post trade.  I think you are searching too hard for holes. Mavs don't need to be perfect to become champions. A little better team than right now and with some winners luck, they can get it done."
"Pat Riley was great at team building. Heat wasn‚Äôt that good until he arrived. Traded for zo, hardaway, thunder Dan. Had pj brown and mashburn. Good teams but they ran into the bulls and the knicks.   Zo got sick. So there was a down year or two. Drafted Caron butler in 2002. signed Lamar Odom, eddie Jones was already on the team, had a decent center in grant and then drafted wade. Wade turned into an all time player but took Miami to the eastern conference semi finals in rookie year while leading them in scoring losing to the number 1 seed Indiana Pacers in 6 games.   2004-2005 - traded for Shaq who was not in his prime but could still drop 22-23. Went to the conference finals but lost when wade got injured.   2006 - signed Gary Payton, brought back zo, signed Jason Williams, Antoine walker and won an improbable championship.   Signed Hassan Whiteside (he used to be good before the contract).  Found Duncan Robinson. Found Kendrick nunn. Drafted bam who is an all star.   Pat Riley has done a good job through it all.   6 finals appearances. 3 rings."
"I‚Äôm personally skeptical of him because I‚Äôve been personally burned by Mo Bamba with this same type of projection. Lanky dude who racks up blocks in college, it‚Äôs easy to project them being great defenders but it‚Äôs less easy for them to actually become one in practice. I‚Äôm sure he will be able to get blocks in the nba, mo Bamba still has an elite block rate. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate to elite rim protection. Hassan whiteside is a good example of that. To be an elite defender you have to be disciplined about going for blocks, strong enough to hold position below the rim, and get boards etc. I think Mobley is way too skinny to even play 5 at all in his early career."
"This narrative is dumb and overblown. He‚Äôs not the third best defensive player in the league, but he‚Äôs top 10 in almost every metric. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs Hassan Whiteside chasing blocks to the detriment of his team."
Hassan Whiteside
"Because some people like Hassan Whiteside were always out of position in order to put up blocks, but wasn‚Äôt all that great of a defender"
Hes obv supposed to make a bunch of 2nd round picks and hassan whiteside look legit duh
"The fact that the Tyler Johnson, Dion Waiters, and Hassan Whiteside contracts, along with Bosh‚Äôs early retirement, didn‚Äôt cripple the Heat‚Äôs franchise for a decade might be Pat Riley‚Äôs greatest achievement."
"I agree, Drummond has his faults but the guy never got to showcase his talents in a situation where his weaknesses are limited.   The way people talk about Drummond, you‚Äôd think he‚Äôs a worse Hassan Whiteside. But then you had a ton of top teams going after him like crazy in the buyout market."
"When a player is expected to be a top3 player on your team, then you also expect him to take things seriously. It is hard to be a winner but also have a carefree attitude. Hassan Whiteside is very similar. People hate them when they laugh and dont give a shit on a huge salary. It is fine though if they are a low salaried bench warmer."
That's some Hassan Whiteside level shit there.
That‚Äôs Hassan Whiteside-esque
"Nobody is going to max him. Hassan Whiteside got the minimum. He's slightly better than Whiteside, but rebounding in the modern NBA can't be your only skill. It isn't worth shit to GMs"
"Hassan Whiteside was like this a couple years ago.. I think it was when Bosh started sitting out, but I might be mistaken."
"Hey Brooklyn, Otto Porter, Avery Bradley, Hassan Whiteside, Jeff Teague are still waiting on ya."
Tell me why Hassan Whiteside isn't an all star.
Dude is a high volume wannabe scorer.  How is he primarily a paint player and only shoot 50% TS?  Basically another Hassan Whiteside where he posts to emptiest of stat lines.  I cannot stress enough how absolutely horrible he is at scoring efficiently.  He's a buyout target because the main teams targeting him have absolutely no need for him as a scorer in any capacity.  All he would need to do is rebound and block shots.  The only chances he would get are wide open lobs or layups.
"We thought Hassan Whiteside might command 10 million a year this past offseason after stepping in for an injured Nurkic and getting some nice (but somewhat empty) stats.   Hassan ended up signing for the vet min this year and couldn't even Crack the rotation,  with the KANGS!  I don't think Drummond is gonna get even 10 mil this summer."
Dude is Hassan Whiteside on repeat   He ain't getting anything more than a vet min next season
Hassan Whiteside gave 2K a shout out like 5 years ago and has been rated in the high 80s up until this year
Yep he's another Hassan Whiteside in the making. Puts up nice looking stats but sucks ass on the court. I could see him turning it around and getting 10mil tho
"a random trade i thought of was  Magic get: Hassan Whiteside, F Robert Woodard (salary, 40th pick in 2020), 2021 Lakers 2nd  Kings get: Mo Bamba  Kings do a 2 for 1 player deal while also taking a flyer on RFA Bamba. Maybe Kings would value this for a different move vs a 2nd for Whiteside.  Magic at least get something for Bamba, maybe can flip Whiteside to a contender.   My imaginary contender flip would be to the Celtics where the Magic get back another mid/late 2021 Celtics 2nd for Whiteside."
"&gt;Dame and Harden on ball creates more and better looks than Steph off ball.  Do you actually have evidence to support this other than the eye test? I personally don‚Äôt know where to find them but I‚Äôd guess there‚Äôs an ‚Äúopen looks‚Äù generated stat somewhere. Not trynna pull a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù or anything, just interested.   &gt;But he plays more off-ball....so it happens much less frequently.  My point was that Steph draws multiple defenders even when playing off ball  &gt;14 &gt;15. It's technically true, but you're also arguing semantics my man. Look at the roster Dame carried to the #2 offense last season.  CJ is a much better #2 than Wiggins  Hassan Whiteside averaged an insanely efficient 15.5 ppg. The Warriors have started a rookie at centre for most of the season.  That‚Äôs not to say the large majority of the offence wasn‚Äôt Lillard. I just don‚Äôt think the supporting casts were equal.  &gt;Dame would also murder someone to play with a guy like Draymond that can carry the defense and facilitate...cause Dame has literally no one on the entire roster than can pass.  A large part of Draymond‚Äôs facilitating is negated by being one of the worst rotation players in the league in terms of scoring. He‚Äôs averaging 6 ppg on 47.3 TS%. That has nothing to do with Steph and everything to do with Draymond. Lillard isn‚Äôt fixing Draymond‚Äôs scoring.  And that isn‚Äôt even mentioning the effect Draymond has in terms of spacing. Have you seen the way they defend him? Just completely daring him to shoot and he passes it up every time. These kinds of things affect offences.  Lillard could use a passer like Draymond, Steph could use a scorer like CJ. Personally I think CJ is more valuable offensively than Draymond."
Y‚Äôall need to stop playing and pick up Hassan whiteside
&gt;-jimmy butler  &gt;-hassan whiteside if he‚Äôd stayed in miami on his deal   ...i really don‚Äôt know man
&gt; Hassan Whiteside  &gt; good center   Pick one.
"Idk about that honestly the man is a glorified Hassan Whiteside to me. he just surrounded by good talent. ingles , conley , mitchel , bog ,clarkson"
"Hassan Whiteside has never passed a basketball, but apparently he has 292 career assists"
Matt Thomas and maybe a 2nd for Hassan whiteside
Zach Lavine is about to be traded for Hassan Whiteside
2016-17 Hassan Whiteside
"Oh stop lmaooo, that was in 2017 with Bam as a raw prospect, backing up Hassan Whiteside."
"How cute. Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond ring any bells?  Don't try to be a bigger moron than you are my dude, it's over üòÇ"
Nah man only absolute HoF talents like Aron baynes and Hassan Whiteside can learn to shoot a lot of3s not such scrubs Royal Iveyson
Any list that doesn't have Hassan Whiteside is automatically invalid.
I just spent a year watching blocks leader Hassan Whiteside. Drummond filling the stat line on the rebuilding teams shouldn't excite nets fans.
Hassan whiteside has entertaining Snapchat stories
"He's a classic ""maybe this is the year he puts it all together"" guy, but you realize that he's 29, isn't getting any better, has no trade value, and makes $10 million per year.  Much rather have Hassan Whiteside."
"Hassan Whiteside with 2 votes, smh"
One of my friends was convinced last year that what would put us over the top was trading Gordon Hayward for Hassan Whiteside.
Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside
"Did you even read the article or bother to look at any stats outside of blocks?  You‚Äôre pushing this narrative that people only think Myles should be dpoy because of blocks, when you yourself are only looking at blocks.  Myles is first in defensive raptor, holds opponents to the lowest fg% within 0-3 feet, and when he‚Äôs on the floor the Pacers have the best defensive rating in the league, meanwhile when he‚Äôs off the floor they‚Äôre 28th.  I‚Äôm a huge Gobert fan, so don‚Äôt take this as me saying Myles is a better defender than Rudy.  Rudy is still the biggest game changing defensive player in the league in my opinion.  It just really grinds my gears when people discredit the year Myles is having by saying he only chases blocks and then compare him to Hassan fucking Whiteside.  Give the man his damn respect.  You can hype up Rudy without tearing Myles down."
"People who think most blocks = dpoy, should hassan whiteside have gotten it last year? Myles turner is a worse defender than embiid, kawhi, giannis, and gobert"
"Blocks =/= good defense. Hassan Whiteside is a below average defensive player, but he‚Äôs led the league in blocks twice and averaged 3.7 blocks per game in a season. He didn‚Äôt just receive DPOY for doing that.  What actually matters are things like - how many shots are they contesting? How are their opponents shooting on those shots? How are their teams performing defensively with them on the floor? And if you look at any of that, Gobert and Turner are neck and neck."
"Haliburton is doing this while playing a huge chunk of his minutes out of position at the 3. The minutes when he does actually get the keys to the offense, he‚Äôs mostly playing with Corey Joseph and Hassan Whiteside. If/when Buddy gets traded and Hali plays next to Fox, Barnes, Bagley, and Holmes, I really think we‚Äôre going to see a lot of things click into place."
"Our bigs blow, Buddy has zero IQ, and we give serious minutes to Cory Joseph and Hassan Whiteside.  But we have Fox so that‚Äôs coo"
"Steals and/or blocks are a bad way to rank defenders. Steph Curry led the league in steals in 2015-16, but he‚Äôs not a lockdown defender. Hassan Whiteside has led the league in blocks a couple times, but he‚Äôs not an elite rim protector."
Most overrated defender in the league.  I swear people just see high block totals and assume elite defense.  Same type of people that though Hassan Whiteside was good
"Well I wonder why? We‚Äôre missing three starters and the defensive anchor that was Nurkic is injured. Not to mention Dame not being a good defender doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt try. He‚Äôs undersized and opponents bigger than him can get past him. Also, do you really think a starting lineup consisting of Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside and a bench of Hezonja, Gabriel, and Ant would be good on defense?"
"Hassan Whiteside: 14/14/0/11.  When he went to Miami in 2014 he had 4 triple doubles in about 1 year, with an average 13.75 points, 13.5 rebounds, 0.5 assists (2 in a single game, 0 in the rest) and 10.75 blocks.   It was a very popular topic for quite some time that made Whiteside one of the most overrated players in the eyes of many +, but it's undeniable that his 4 triple doubles with blocks coming in as a ""nobody"" were hilarious and impressive, that's why I think he deserves this odd stat line named after him."
Hassan Whiteside
"I think the top 5 playing now are: Rudy Gobert, CJ Mccollum, Hassan Whiteside, Danny Green, and Fred VanVleet"
You still have to be good at passing and playmaking to just decide to do that though. Imagine if Javale McGee or Hassan Whiteside tried to do that. It would be a fucking disaster.

Hassan Whiteside
"Given that they WERE able to get out of the contracts of Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, and James Johnson, I think that it is safe to assume that was sarcasm.  Ah shoot. You knew it was sarcastic, didn't you....."
"&gt; Yeah, this post is ridiculous.  Nah u/mikeydale007 is right. This is too big of a hole to dig out of. The Heat are SO screwed.   Heat never should've traded this pick for Goran Dragic, who clearly hasn't contributed to the Heat at all. Yeah I know what you are gonna say...he's a leader of the Heat and he was arguably the Heat's best player for Rounds 1, 2, and 3 in the 2020 playoffs. But what happened in the Finals? He got injured and couldn't even play!  The Heat's 2021 first round draft pick, on the other hand, is guaranteed to be the next superstar.  Heat also won't be able to get out of the contracts of Dion Waiters, Hassan Whiteside, and James Johnson. Those are untradeable contracts. Also, Winslow can't make it on the court at all. That's their youth movement? Get real.   And don't give me none of this ""Yeah but their best players have all missed tons of games due to covid protocols."" Just don't give me none of that because I don't have a good response to it."
"I don‚Äôt know, for a few years now Hassan Whiteside has just been straight bad. Maybe the r/nba community he isn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôd say most people still overate him."
Not sure if you‚Äôre being serious but fantasy stats don‚Äôt translate to winning players. Drummond and Hassan Whiteside are great examples
"Fox,Heild,Lebron,Barnes,Holmes Bench: Haliburton, Bagley, Bjelica, Cory Joseph, Hassan Whiteside, Glen Robinson 3. Yea I would put them as a contender."
"Box score doesn't always tell the full story. A good example is hassan whiteside. Obviously peak boogie is way better than him, but hassan whiteside had the stats of a top 15 player for most of last season, and he wasn't even a top 15 center in terms of actual value added to his team."
They‚Äôre gonna try to do better but yes it‚Äôs very possible  Hassan Whiteside gets memed but as a C to play 18-20 min he‚Äôs a good option if he gets bought out
Hassan Whiteside 2.0. Hopefully not though.
Hassan Whiteside nodding and smiling somewhere

poor man's Hassan Whiteside?
"There is a very thin market for that though, and post Jrue trade there are less picks to leverage.  Does Hassan Whiteside fix the issue? He‚Äôs an athlete, and could help against the Embiid matchup. At the same time, he kills spacing which is why Brook is there in the first place.   Would Larry Nance at the 5 help? Yes he‚Äôs a great athlete, but now who guards the dominant bigs?   I‚Äôm not saying these are the only moves available, just trying to show case how tricky it can be to find a quick fix that doesn‚Äôt create a new problem.   If you are of the mindset that Giannis should play the 5 for a majority of the time, even against the elite bigs (Embiid and Bam), then someone like Nance makes a lot of sense."
Contract year players are my favorite phenemon. The Hassan Whiteside effect üòÇ
"Hassan whiteside, mvp year Westbrook, and that one  season Chamberlain was 50 ppg are the kings of empty stats.  Empty stats is when your numbers don't accurately reflect your impact."
feels like the beginning of the hassan whiteside arc
"Hassan Whiteside, everybody together now"
Hassan Whiteside is the absolute fucking undefeated king of Empty Stats.
"I mean it can also have a lot of truth. For all the guys you listed there were also guys like Monta Ellis, Andrea Bargnani, Antoine Walker. In the current era you would point to guys like Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter, Jabari Parker. The reason we forget about them is that teams eventually see how little they impact winning and they wash out of the league."
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
Hassan Whiteside
Even Hassan Whiteside has a career high of 7 assists (and a career high of 1 in the playoffs)
"I definitely think the Nets should get Hassan Whiteside.  As someone who is a fan of a team who may have to see the Nets in the playoffs I'd want nothing more.  He'll get three blocks and allow 90 points with poor pick and roll defense, all while flexing.  But hey the highlights will look amazing."
*slides in*  How about a slightly used Hassan Whiteside?
Enjoy Hassan Whiteside
"I mean he played Hassan Whiteside off the floor, and while a lot of that is speed, you don‚Äôt get that without serious power"
"Yeah, there are guys who you get shocked at how old they are, like Hassan Whiteside for example. He's fucking 31 and I thought he was like 26.    Oladipo is definitely not one of those guys lol he has had a pretty up and down career."
&gt;Dame put up 30-5-8 on 63% TS last when when our 3rd best player was Hassan Whiteside. Watching a warriors fan try and use the spacing excuse now is fucking hilarious by the way   And the 2and best player was cJ McCollum. The warriors second best player is Draymond or Wiggins.   &gt;My bad didn't realize playoffs two years ago is a factor in the 2021 mvp race.  Neither of them are in that race though. Or most the players on the list above.
&gt; You want to compare their teamates and the spacing they both have  Dame put up 30-5-8 on 63% TS last when when our 3rd best player was Hassan Whiteside.  Watching a warriors fan try and use the spacing excuse now is fucking hilarious by the way   &gt; Or what happened last time they met in the playoffs.  My bad didn't realize playoffs two years ago is a factor in the 2021 mvp race.
"If Hassan Whiteside is the answer, you're asking the wrong question"
Connecting the dots I do think Nets are gonna add Hassan Whiteside or Javale Mcgee using the disabled player exception and second round picks or buyout market. They probably want to see if anyone is bought out and how Claxton looks before pulling the trigger.  As you mentioned Robin Lopez is prob also on the radar but with Thomas Bryant hurt I'm not sure it is likely unless Bradley Beal is gonna get moved
Hassan Whiteside plays fake defense. Just puts up big block numbers sometimes. But rn he's not even in the rotation for the Kings.
"Hassan Whiteside isn‚Äôt excellent, he puts up big block numbers but that‚Äôs because he chases blocks a lot instead of doing his actual job on defense."
I haven't watched any Kings games in a horrendously long time so I'm way out of the loop - isn't Hassan Whiteside an excellent defensive player? Why does their defense suck?
"Reminds me of Lebron‚Äôs first 1-1.5 years in Miami where they needed a proper center and tried signing Greg oden, playing udonis Harlem, playing washed vets, etc before they finally decided to go all in on playing Chris Bosh or Shane Battier at the 5 and take the defense/rebounding hit in exchange for the spacing/shooting.  Imagine if they managed to find a Hassan Whiteside type of undrafted impactful rebounding and defensive intimidator center perfectly in that Heatles timeframe rather than a few years later.   Granted, everyone thinks he‚Äôs a bum now, but he was a revelation when he was putting up 17/14/4 blocks per game fresh out of Lebanon.  Also, I think they also cut Pat Bev in his early years when they were struggling to find a better point guard than Mario chalmers."
Is that a cry for Hassan Whiteside
Kings will give Whiteside back to Portland for some draft capital or young talent. Don‚Äôt you want your precious Hassan back??
"Gary Harris, Trae Young, Nerlans Noel, Hassan Whiteside"
Hassan Whiteside made me believe otherwise
"All 3 are efficient scorers, Booker and Beal are also really good passers for non point guards. All 3 are really good offensive players (great for Booker and Beal actually), and yeah Lavine and Beal are pretty bad defensively (Booker isn't bad anymore) but they are not the ones that kill their teams defense.  And all 3 ""carry"" their teams offense to pretty decent level.  &amp;#x200B;  Empty stat guys are guys who get stat that amount to nothing, for example D'Angelo Russell the ""awesome"" all star that carried that Nets team to the 19th offense that year and has never ever played in a decent offense (and despite that most year those offenses are actually better when he's off the floor). Or like Hassan Whiteside and his perenial 13 rebounds/3 blocks per game stat lines while his team can't actually stop anything at the rim"
hassan whiteside is another possibility
Imagine this Nets team with contract year Hassan Whiteside üòÇ
nets should trade for hassan whiteside or andre drummond if they want a chance vs the lakers
Nets need Hassan Whiteside üòÇ
"I mean his comment isn‚Äôt about analyzing Hassan as a player.  Certainly there are reasons why Whiteside doesn‚Äôt contribute to winning basketball in the modern NBA, but there are a lot of people who think he does because he puts up stats."
"You guys like Hassan Whiteside, right?"
"Wassup Portland, your friendly neighbour here. I hear you guys need a center, hm, well we got a slightly used Hassan Whiteside here."

"Completely throw chemistry, locker room peace, and likable players out the window and go for Hassan Whiteside."
"Ha, funny how that works.  Our third best player was Hassan Whiteside last year(who's literally playing 12 minutes a game on the Kings) and Dame put up 30-4-8 on 62%TS and the talk was about Dame being unable to carry like Westbrook did.    I'll be curious to see people's takes when Curry has to deal with being the lone allstar in the playoffs for the first time."
HASSAN WHITESIDE!!!
"Idk, Hassan Whiteside got traded to the pacers in my 2k game and the dude is balling. Clearly this means whiteside is being used incorrectly, right?"
I feel like I‚Äôve said this before but Turner on defense what Hassan Whiteside thinks he is. üòÇ It‚Äôs honestly so fun to watch. He blocks everything but he also does other stuff that you know defenders are supposed to do.
Why else you think Sacramento signed Hassan Whiteside? They accounted for this possibility.
People just see defense as blocks and steal but can‚Äôt give you a definition on a defensive rotation. They see Hassan Whiteside and think he‚Äôs an elite defender. They give Giannis shit for not guarding Jimmy on ball when Giannis is more valuable as a help defender and could get switched on ball. The average nba fan doesn‚Äôt know shit about defense
"He looking like hassan whiteside out there, lumbering from end to end, setting ineffective screens, 1-7 3pt, he a shell of his former self."
"&gt; Or couldn't get quality shots against more attention. I suppose you probably believe he just stopped shooting as much to avoid embarrassing the opposition or something, but I sincerely doubt that.  What kind of dumb ass strawman argument is that? No, he took less shot because Tony Parker became a much bigger part of the offense, no teammate since Robinson in Duncan's rookie year took more shot than Parker did from 03-04 onward. Plus Pop really started managing his minutes, he never played less than 39 minutes a game before 03/04 after he never played more than 35. Less minutes plus deferring to other players is why his shots went down.  &gt; Any big? Are you sure about that? You might want to retract that offer in a minute.  &gt; How about O'Neal and his career .582? Left him off your list, didya? Or Robinson, and his .519? Or Dwight Howard and his .565? Or Amar'e Stoudemire and his .538? Or Alonzo Mourning and his .529? Or Karl Malone and his .516? Or Olajuwon and his .513? Or Pau Gasol and his .513? Or Rik Smits and his .507? &gt;  &gt; And for that matter, during the few seasons in Boston when Garnett had something resembling Duncan's supporting cast, he shot 53-54% despite being in his mid-thirties by then. Nowitzki was also more efficient than Duncan despite substantially more volume and attention. &gt;  So, Duncan was more efficient than Chris Webber and matched Rik Smits. Wow, I am whelmed. Is that all you've got?  Shaq is the most dominate low post scorer and efficient low post big man ever, not gonna argue that. Rik Smits really? Might as well say Gobert, DeAndre Jordan, Tyson Chandler and Hassan Whiteside are better than Duncan because their FG% is in the 60s. Robinson, Malone, and Olajuwon were an era before Duncan, I was comparing him to his contemporaries. Garnett's efficiency went up in Boston because his usage went way down, notice as his ppg and shots per game went down his efficiency went up. Pau was never the scorer Duncan was, Pau topped 20 ppg only twice in his career, Duncan did it nine times. If you want to argue at Dwight's 4 year peak in Orlando from 08-12 he was better than Duncan at the same time I won't argue that, Duncan was 32 and 11 years deep into his career. He peak doesn't match Duncan's peak though and outside of those peak Orlando years, Dwight doesn't even come close to comparing to Duncan. Dirk wasn't more efficient than Duncan, Dirk shot over 50% twice in his career. Even if you take into account 3 point shooting and free throws, that doesn't close the gap on how much better Duncan was as a rebounder and defender.    &gt; Almost every seven foot professional basketball player suffers back pain.  Yeah, and once it becomes a chronic issue, they start to become a shell of their former selves &gt;  &gt; Weren't you just saying he was never the same after an injury at 23? And how his unremarkable results without All-Star teammates should be ignored, because he was over-the-hill at 32 by then?  He was never the same athletically after 23, so in that sense we never got to see his skill combined with his peak athleticism, that's a scary thought actually now that I think about it. Wouldn't say unremarkable, but yeah eleven years into an NBA career, most players aren't the same as they were at their peak, especially big men.   &gt; I watched him play, and he wasn't that great. Again, we've plenty of numbers to support that. He was exceedingly lucky to be drafted by a team that won 60 games repeatedly without him, and who reloaded with a number of All-Stars during his career. Otherwise, he'd have nowhere near the undeserved reputation he has.  Then you must be watching something completely different than literally every other fan, sports analyst, and player who played against him and said how great he was. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Pick the best Cali team: the Sacramento Kings. They have an elite coach in Luke Walton and elite players like Hassan Whiteside and Marvin Bagley.
I haven't watch any of his games but all the comments here remind me of Hassan Whiteside (His breakthrough season)
Dearron fox Marvin Bagley Buddy Hield Hassan Whiteside Harrison Barnes
"Surprise: Tyrese Haliburton. League ready on day 1, makes whole team better, maybe best player on the team so far.  Disappointing: Hassan Whiteside. Nice having a real shot locker, but he's otherwise a complete liability."
"Honestly, I think it's more the *players* who would never do it: If a team gets relegated, they'll still have the same basic value for owning a team on paper.  It's the players who would be the bigger problem: If you thought super-teams were bad NOW, imagine it when players know if you take a chance on a smaller team, you're risking relegation.  Hell, that'd even be doubled since suddenly the smaller market teams wouldn't have a prayer at the fringe stars: Using this year's FA surprise as an example- if you're Hassan Whiteside, if you're going to Northern California anyway, do you agree to sign a small deal with Sacramento, knowing they'll probably get relegated and in the process your NBA career is likely done, or do you sign that same small deal with Fresno in the ABA, knowing them getting you will likely mean they get promoted next year, you instantly get back to stardom and a future big contract, and you'll never have to buy a beer in Fresno again for getting them to the NBA?"
"Considering he‚Äôs a big man I would say the whole season. PER is a flawed stat that leans towards bigs, Hassan whiteside was a top 10 PER player last year. The joker has been playing absolutely insane this year though."
"Austin rivers, nic Batum, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan whiteside, Marc gasol, demarcus cousins,Harry Giles, and Jeff green are all valuable players on minimum contracts"
"What about Hassan ""Ain't nobody doing it with blocks"" Whiteside?"
Last year Hassan Whiteside and Brook Lopez were the top 2 in blocks.
"Coby White, Derrick White, Royce White, DJ White, Hassan Whiteside"
"Coby White, Isaiah Whitehead, Derrick White, Okaro White, Hassan Whiteside"
Myles Turner is who Hassan Whiteside thinks he is on defense
Even Hassan Whiteside wouldve been better than Aron Baynes.
"Michael Beasley- Thought he'd be Melo 2.0  Derrick Williams- Thought he'd be a 20 ppg highlight machine  Justise Winslow- I'm still on Winslow island, but I thought he'd be Draymond light by now  and the one i'm most ashamed of was Jahlil Okafor, after watching one to many ball is life mixtapes of him dominating 6'7 highschoolers and LeBron leaving I was down with Tank to the Floor for Okafor  Bonus reel is Hassan Whiteside convincing me he was Wilt reincarnate after a half a season"
"I know Shaq doesn't necessarily need to be going at heads the way he does, but it is what it is.  The contract comment, well I just see that as an overarching comment for a lot of the contracts that are given, Gobert's contract just happened to be the most recent and yeah if I'm looking Giannis who just got paid and Gobert...I'm not going to say that Gobert deserves $200M like Giannis does or Anthony Davis.  Gobert is legit but he's not elite and if the cap money didn't need to be spent, I don't see anyone giving him a $200M deal.  Shaq does speaks a lot on this, but I'm sure it's a sentiment that plenty of older players share.  Lot of the players getting paid today are nowhere near as good as players from past but they can still get $20M/yr where back in the 80s/90s it would take an elite player like 10yrs to reach that amount. Tobias Harris worth his contract or was Hassan Whiteside when he got paid?  Even Jordan wasn't getting his money until he came back from retirement and he was damn sure much more valuable than just a couple million/yr that he was getting."
Have you considered Hassan Whiteside?
"Little asshole wasn‚Äôt even grateful either, told me D Wade sucks when he saw it. For one, this little shit is ten years old and knows nothing about D Wade, and for two it was a Hassan Whiteside jersey because they were the only ones available in Australia when it dropped so I guess he can‚Äôt read. Should have snatched it back on the spot."
"Yeah he's bad in space and defensive IQ both of which are more important.  There are players though kind of in this prototype who are kind of polarizing. Someone like Jonas Valanciunas is slow as hell but his dFG% is good, his teams defend the rim well with him on the court and they allow fewer shots with him on the court at the rim. He also does better than you think in the impact metrics defensively. There are smart people I know who will argue a player like this has gotten pretty underrated and that we blame them too much for their teams issues. Im not quite there but I can buy the argument he is somewhat underrated. Hassan Whiteside another classic ex, not just stuff like PER but even PIPM rates him shockingly high. It's a blindspot in the metrics probably but general perception might also have blindspots to gauging him somewhat."
Look like we gonna see the kangz with dame and hassan Whiteside dominating again
Hassan whiteside?
Hassan whiteside I think is minimum now. Steal defensive player.
Very much wrong. He gets a lot of blocks because he challenges a lot of shots. This isn't hassan whiteside.  The fact he has gotten a lot of blocks has resulted in people underrating him and calling him a stat chaser.
Hassan Whiteside kind of did for a little bit
Hassan Whiteside is somewhere nodding in agreement that unorthodox free throws are the way
Didn't hassan Whiteside make it big in China too?
1 - Westbrook  2 - Lou Williams  3 - Ben Simmons  4 - Enes Kanter   5 - Hassan Whiteside
All time? Primo Pasta deserves a shout out. Wolves Wiggins and his 20 ppg on bad efficiency. Enes Kanter as a starter with awful defense and the most meaningless 20/10 games ever. Hassan Whiteside for obvious reasons.
"Yes summer 2016 was rough and absolutely set us back. But when you look at each move, outside of paying ET way to fuckin much you can justify the others.  They were able to dump Crabbe to the nets for Andrew Nicholson to help the cap.   Festus was a complete disaster but only counted one year on the books.   ML actually was traded for Hassan Whiteside who everyone was dying to have in the first place that summer.   Moe was overpaid but made positive contributions.   Its popular to dump on Olshey right now but I havent heard any good ideas to improve the roster, they absolutely have their hands tied right now. And it sure sounds like Dame didnt wanted to trade CJ and that was the only path to improvement in my mind."
Let me introduce you to Hassan Whiteside.
"To me, empty stats is shit like Andre Drummond's rebound numbers being so high because he is so bad at scoring he keeps getting his own misses. Another example would be some player that gets like 20ppg avg but 10 of that is in garbage time when his team has already lost. I wouldn't call Sexton or MPJ that just yet. But Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond definitely do a lot of that."
Lou Williams Jordan Clarkson Carmelo Anthony Damontas Sabonis Hassan Whiteside
PG: Greivis Vasquez  SG: Kevin Martin  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Kristaps Porzingis  C:  Hassan Whiteside
Russ-Easily the best player on this list but his efficiency and IQ really get exposed in the playoffs  Sexton-Closer to Lou Williams than a true star worth a max  Sabonis-By the advanced metrics one of the most horrific defenders in the NBA. People try and tell me that the Pacers should trade Turner and start Sabonis at center like it‚Äôs that easy  And ofc the goats of empty stats Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Replace Drummond with Kanter for your challenge
"Sexton   CJ McCollum  MPJ  Porzingis  Whiteside  ""I'm just trying to get my 2k rating up."" -Hassan Whiteside"
His teams have been mediocre. Their 3rd best player for a while was Hassan Whiteside. I'd leave if I were him too
So don't think Hassan Whiteside.
"I mean, Kerr's not wrong. To me Wiseman has always looked like he would be a really good double double machine at his best, think Hassan Whiteside but you replace the ""doing stupid shit for stats"" attribute with a servicable jumper."
Hassan Whiteside was gonna be an all-star. I was super high on that guy when he first came up lol
Respect your Opinion but I'd argue the Bam block was better simply because of how hard Tatum tried to throw it down and how Bams hand looked in slow motion. I thought he broke his wrist tbh.   Another underrated one that I can recall is Hassan Whiteside straight up grabbing Pascal Siakiams fade away out the air. It was a regular season game but it was wild to see a jump shot just lose altitude.   Honorable mentions to ANY snatch blocks because those are the nastiest blocks you could possibly have imo
So you're telling me Hassan Whiteside isn't one of the greatest defenders in the past decade?
You guys don‚Äôt honestly think Hassan Whiteside isn‚Äôt an NBA player right?
yep welcome to the suns hassan whiteside
Lmao theres a reason Hassan Whiteside is coming off the bench on a vet min in Sacramento after putting up like 3 blocks per game in Portland last year
"They will need to get a great coach, a great veteran leader, and role players that know the team concept (as in not Hassan Whiteside).  This is not something you can accomplish in one season."
Yes they are  Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Jeremi Grant isn‚Äôt empty stats tho
Another Hassan Whiteside??? Nooooooo
"Deion Waiters, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson, Kelly Olynyk all got $50 million. Hassan Whiteside got $100 million. And that‚Äôs *just* the Heat lol"
"Andrew Drummond type center's are on the fast track out of the league, he used to be an all star, now barely got minutes for the Lakers, similar to Hassan Whiteside, used to be an all star, now I think he is a back up for Sacremento, the only way bigs like that can stay is if they bring a positive impact, guys like Capela, and Steven Adam's type impact, idk the impact Adam's has for New Orleans, but I do know he was loved in OKC"
"He'll probably be getting the Hassan Whiteside treatment at this point. By that, I mean, minimum contract on the worst team in the league."
"you can make that argument about every single counting stat though  scoring - took too many shots, chucked your team out the game  offensive rebounds - andre drummond ass dudes, only getting boards cuz you missed a gimme  defensive rebounds - russell westbrook getting free boards from steven adams doing all the work  steals - gambling instead of playing fundamentally sound defense  blocks - goaltending ass dudes like hassan whiteside"
Hassan Whiteside vibes
Hassan Whiteside. Still a good dude.
"Hassan whiteside he can average 20 10 but if you watch him play, when he doesn‚Äôt get the ball he just gives up"
Hassan whiteside is regularly at the top of the league in blocks. He doesn‚Äôt play good defense. Numbers lie
"andre drummond, hassan whiteside are empty stat players imo"
Butler was the sign and trade. We got J Rich out of it and the Heat sent Mo Harkless and Hassan Whiteside out of Miami.
Why you gotta call out Hassan Whiteside for?
Hassan Whiteside at 4 years / $98 million.   Tyler Johnson at 4 years / $ 50 million.   Eddie Jones at 7 years / $93 million.
"Unless you're someone like Drummond or Hassan Whiteside empty stats isn't a real thing.  &amp;#x200B;  Booker was an empty stats guy until his team got better and suddenly he's the ""next kobe"". KAT just doesn't really have a good roster surrounding him but his talent even in a vacuum is absurd."
Hassan Whiteside maybe? Every fanbase of the teams he's played for either clown the guy or just hate him.
So... Hassan Whiteside?
"True that. Spo never got his respect until years after Lebron left.. which blows my mind given he took teams led by Dion Waiters to the playoffs multiple times, AFTER he just won 2 titles.   I don‚Äôt believe any other coach could have averaged &gt;.500 over the years Lebron/Wade/Bosh left with the talent left on those Heat rosters (Luke Babbitt, Rodney McGruder, Hassan Whiteside, Justise Winslow‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad)  I‚Äôd put Spo in a higher tier as far as coaches goes but I do think Lue is finally getting his respect as a very good coach, which is nice to see."
"Jabari and Wiggins had amazing numbers in their first 3 years. Hassan Whiteside led the league in blocks per game by a HUGE margin that year and was above 2 bpg per 36 minutes for quite a long time. Drummond led the league in rebounding for like half the decade. Yes, they have more impressive stats. A 'Lmao no' won't change that."
"See: Hassan Whiteside, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins until this year, Andre Drummond etc."
Basic box score numbers and FG % ‚Ä¶ come on.  Are you familiar with Hassan Whiteside?
Drummond Hassan Whiteside
"Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter"
"Hassan Whiteside? This is trolling. That dude had one season where he was good and then looked awful immediatiely.  Also, Roy Hibbert's one and half seasons being good was better than anything some of these dudes did... Nikola Vucevic spent a whole decade doing nothing."
You have Hassan fucking Whiteside over a 3 time DPOY
"Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside (when he still tried)   A score of 50 to 47 can still win a game"
Well the Heat in particular fell apart due to injuries. Wade‚Äôs knees expired and Bosh had the blood clots so Hassan Whiteside was like the next man standing
(Jokes) On the topic of Fantasy - another premium pickup for stats vs. reality was pre-Sacramento Hassan Whiteside. Boards and Blocks all day

"I'd say Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Lou williams are some empty stat players"
"He just went off for 29 and 9 assists with zero turnovers in a crucial game in the WCF, I would trust that it isn‚Äôt some sort of Hassan Whiteside scenario"
"Hiding one bad guard on defense with modern schemes is not particularly difficult.  Portland's issue on defense isn't that Dame is singularly awful (he's bad, but not some horror show that ruins everything himself), but that we pair him with another bad defensive guard, and then run an undersized 3, and then whenever Nurkic stubs his toe (which he does, like, twice a year every year) we end up running the worst defensive big man rotation in the league night in and night out. Whether that's Enes Kanter or Meyers Leonard or Hassan Whiteside or... well, you get the picture."
"Honestly, with the firepower we have, we don't need an elite defensive presence. Literally Andre Drummond or Hassan Whiteside would be perfect for this to gobble up rebounds and hunt blocks"
"Saw Hassan Whiteside in Vegas a couple weeks ago, did the same thing with my friend but he just told us to fuck off instead lol"
Hassan Whiteside fell tf off quick too
"That last one is absolutely hilarious.  &gt;These Four NBA Players Want You to Know They Can Shoot Now  Daaamn, talk yo shit, who is it btw?  &gt;Lonzo Ball, Ben Simmons, Hassan Whiteside, and Andre Drummond  https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjl-I4PBErItFL5c-C7-g_lAMk4fjfyzi48k3o=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"
Oh thank god he's finally committing himself to  [Improving](https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-ben-simmons-jump-shot-update-vocal-leadership-defense-media-day/)  [His](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29074004/ben-simmons-hears-talk-process-not-public-experiment)  [Shot](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/8/30/17800912/lonzo-ball-ben-simmons-hassan-whiteside-shooting)
I got Hassan Whiteside and a 2nd
"Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield and Hassan Whiteside straight up, who says no üòÇ"
If you actually watched Moses Brown playing you would say he's promising. He's basically poor man's Hassan Whiteside on a &gt;$2 million dollar deal locked up through 2024 who's only 21
If you actually watched Moses Brown playing you wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs promising. He‚Äôs basically poor man‚Äôs Hassan Whiteside
Hes amazing jazz don't deserve him hopefully they add another star around him since there 2nd best player is a overpaid Hassan Whiteside
"Which of those years did he have a top 5 roster in the East? Only 2020 and he made the fucking finals game 6 lol  Y‚Äôall gotta remember Bosh was out with blood clots in 2016 and that team lost to the Raptors in 7 games in the ECSF (Raptors lost in 6 to the future champs in the ECF)  From 2017-2019 I‚Äôm sorry he couldn‚Äôt take old Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, and Dion Waiters to the second round of the playoffs.   Spo has proven time and time he‚Äôs a phenomenal coach with or without Bron."
"Depends on what you perceive his true potential to be. I think he can definitely get some crazy double doubles in the future with Boston if the situation is right, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna be an all star or even a starting caliber center on a playoff team. He‚Äôs gonna be similar to hassan whiteside or 2020 andre drummond where he can put up monster stats every now and then but they‚Äôre empty stats."
Hassan whiteside
"I'm fairly certain the other guy didn't mean current day, backup center Hassan Whiteside"
His *floor* is not Hassan Whiteside lol.
Nah. More like Hassan Whiteside.
"He‚Äôs the point guard version of Hassan Whiteside, so no"
"It's interesting to note that the deepest run that Dame and CJ have made in the past few years have been with an Aminu/Harkless frontcourt; basically non-starters offensively but they played defense hard enough to cover up Dame and CJ.  Iirc, Harkless got traded with Meyers Leonard to Miami for a one-year rental of Hassan Whiteside to hold the rim down while Nurkic was out for the season. They also wanted to replace both Harkless and Aminu with guys who had a bit more of a bunch offensively in Rodney Hood and Zac Collins. Unfortunately both of those guys got injured and became shells of themselves."
"If it‚Äôs any consolation, losing in 2014 set off a chain reaction which lead to a half decade featuring Hassan Whiteside and Deion Waiters."
"Sometimes I feel like we've gotten past the times where Dame was underrated then I see shit like this. I really don't know how you can watch the guy and still feel like this.  Maybe that's it, maybe you don't watch him.  You just watched a team led by Chris Paul/Devin Booker make the finals and you think somehow Dame Lillard isn't good enough to be that lol.  People have a really hard time separating how good a player is from how good their team is. You stick him next to Lebron for a year and people would think he was a god.    &gt; and average playmaker at best.  This is just hilariously wrong.  He was 7th in assists last year.  He was 16th in turnovers. He averaged 10 assists a game on TWO turnovers a game this year in the playoffs. In 2020 he lead a team starting Hassan Whiteside and Carmelo Anthony(with Mario Hezonja 2nd off the bench) to the 3rd best offense in the league.  He's statistically the best pnr guard in the league, and actually set the highest recorded ppp for PnRs in league history.   &gt;  but he is also a high volume shooter.  ...in the last two years he's averaged just under 30ppg on 62.5% TS.  He's one of the most efficient players in the league."
i don‚Äôt know... Hassan Whiteside literally could only get a minimum contract this season after averaging 3 blocks a game and 13 rebounds. and like 15 points too.
"Harden and Lebron are the only ones I think you can definitevely say are better at dragging a team to the playoffs.    Our most common starting lineup last year was Dame, CJ, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan Whiteside, and either Trevor Ariza or Kent Bazemore and we had the 3rd best offense in the league"
Then you have guys like Hassan Whiteside chasing blocks instead of playing good D
"I don't think the nuggets would do that personally. I think MPJ's ceiling is too high.  As for Harrison Barnes I think he could do a really good job on a winning team.  I think the raptors could push for a deal for him and Hassan Whiteside, maybe giving up Norman Powell Aaron Baynes Patrick McCaw and some picks? This would give the Raptors Center depth and scoring while the King's get draft assets and some expiring deals."
"I don't have a dog in the MVP fight, but if you are going to stan Jokic check out NBA Math on twitter, their charts on Total Points Added tell a pretty clear picture.  [Tweet #1](https://twitter.com/NBA_Math/status/1366790402041208832)  [Tweet #2](https://twitter.com/NBA_Math/status/1366789144068771843)   These both show Jokic as head &amp; shoulders above the field.  I don't believe there's a single metric that can effectively grade player performance, however before you shit on their stats just look at who the other leaders are: Giannis, Curry, LeBron, Embiid, Lillard, Harden, Kawhi, Luka etc.  It's not like their metrics are spitting out Hassan Whiteside or some weak shit like that, it's the ""right"" list of players.   Jokic is blowing them all away, he's having a truly nutty season."
Honestly maybe even Kyle Guy and Hassan Whiteside are more useful
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
I always think Hassan Whiteside is like 27-28 but he's 31 now. It's because he was such a late bloomer.
"I wanted to have a diligent nba filled conversation on Mike Conley‚Äôs DMPM and a philosophical debate on if DMPM is an important stat in determining a players defense. Then we would go on a further debate on if any stats can evaluate defense or is it all just eye test, I would use Hassan Whiteside as an example and then go further on breaking down defense as a whole. We would go on to talk about if defense improves based on system not player, using Wiggins as an example. Then we would never talk to each other again on this internet platform because I don‚Äôt use it often and I dislike jazz fans. I hate wasted potential"
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."
Hassan Whiteside is terrible for other reasons and it‚Äôs not because he attempts to block shots but maybe he‚Äôd be better suited not contesting shots or just falling down trying to draw charges.  That should fit in with everything everyone else is doing and lead to some of the most abysmal defensive #s and effort the league hasn‚Äôt seen since the 60s
"Yes but that plays into ‚Äúthe game has changed entirely‚Äù point vs the ‚Äúno one contests shots anymore‚Äù.  Like, Hassan Whiteside contests shots all the fucking time and is a terrible defender."
If Lebron can win a chip with with fuckin Hassan Whiteside as his starting center I‚Äôll put him as GOAT lmao
"Why is he such a good defender but his team has a middle of the pack DRtg? Gobert is a much better help defender it‚Äôs not only about blocking shots. Positioning on the pick and roll, and help defense is very important. Also not fouling. Hassan Whiteside can rack up blocks but that doesn‚Äôt make him a better defender than Richaun Holmes."
"Bad trades all around  1. Covington is significantly better and more available than Porzingis, the Mavs would have to send out at least 2-3 1st round picks for the trade itself to make sense (1 at least for KPs injuries and contract)  2. Hassan Whiteside wont go for less than a 1st round pick most likely  3. Montrezl Harrell is at the moment better than Grant (albeit barely) and you are suggesting they throw in a top 5 3&amp;D player in KCP AND a 1st round pick? Talk about a desperation move from the Lakers"
He‚Äôs just a slightly better Hassan Whiteside
"Some people see a losing team and immediately believe it's because the star player isn't very good. When watching a game it's pretty easy to tell who is a proper star vs a ""empty calories star"".  For example Hassan Whiteside last year was dropping near all star level numbers but barely moved his feet on defense and can't pass/shoot from beyond 10ft."
"I used to think so, till I watched Hassan Whiteside"
Nice to see someone give Taevion Kinsey props. I‚Äôm a Marshall fan and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone look this out of place (in a good way) since Hassan Whiteside. I think he‚Äôll eventually settle in to be a nice role player somewhere in the league.
Nesmith looks like a smaller Hassan Whiteside
Hassan Whiteside is the best player in the NBA
"tbf every GM has made mistakes when it comes to contracts lol, its just a bet you make on a player's potential. Hassan Whiteside at 100 mil/4 yrs for Pat Riley, Steven Adams at 100 mil/4 yrs for Sam Presti, Ryan Anderson at 80 mil/4 yrs for Daryl Morey, etc some of the best executives in the NBA have gotten it wrong a few times"
"Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter"
"Case in point, Hassan Whiteside the last few years"
Hassan Whiteside.
Hassan Whiteside.
Watching the games does not = gut feeling. There are many aspects of basketball that do not translate well into stats  If you went off stats alone Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond would be better than Dray
Hassan Whiteside anyone?
We need Hassan whiteside
Hassan Whiteside could never
"Y‚Äôall have needed a good rim protector and true big man for a while and he gets TT, who‚Äôs not much bigger than Theis. Wouldn‚Äôt someone like Hassan Whiteside (who‚Äôs earning a vet min this year on the Kings iirc) been good? Idk why more teams didn‚Äôt go after him, he‚Äôs good at like 2 things but some teams need that."
"I mean there was a time when Hassan Whiteside, DeAndre Jordan, and Andre Drummond were considered ""elite"" centers. Today's big men are definitely thriving compared to that."
Heat Culture = just don‚Äôt be Hassan Whiteside. That‚Äôs all you have to do to fit into Heat Culture.
"PER is a flawed stats that values offensive bigs and higher counting stats. Defense is heavily discredited by PER, unless the player is getting high BPG or SPG numbers, which doesn't necessarily mean good defender. Hassan Whiteside had high BPG numbers and Monta Ellis had high SPG numbers but neither are elite defenders."
If I recall the last two triple doubles with blocks/steals were Hassan Whiteside and Anthony Davis and there's no way either of them crack 10 assists in a regulation game.
"Stotts is a coach who specifically is good at getting the best out of his role players, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Seth Curry, Shabazz Napier, Allen Crabbe, Maurice Harkless, he‚Äôs extremely good at putting players into positions to shine with their particular skillsets and it‚Äôs why we‚Äôve had so many reclamation projects or seen so many journeymen get paid after stops in Portland.  Hell, look at how good he managed to make Hassan Whiteside look after he wasn‚Äôt even seeing the court anymore."
It felt like Hassan Whiteside turned into Steve Nash at the free throw line last year for us. Dude wasn't a great FT shooter but he didn't miss when the game was on the line.

"He was fortunate to start his career during the last few years where big men who put up good counting stats but were actually negative on offense and much worse on defense than their counting stats would suggest could still be viewed as elite players.  Think Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Hassan Whiteside.  Teams have gotten much much smarter about this archetype in the past 5 years."
"Idk about that Hassan Whiteside is on a minimum, Drummond could be out of the league sooner than we think"
"Tbf both of those accolades were absolutely ridiculous, he got all-NBA the year DeAndre Jordan was the first team center and everyone agrees the DPOY vote was a joke. The guy that voted Drummond put Hassan Whiteside as his second choice"
Hassan Whiteside is miles better than Drummond and i dont even like Hassan
To be fair Whiteside had zero lateral quickness. We tried hedging with him in the preseason and the ball handler just ran circles around him to the rim to the point where Terry told Hassan to just chase blocks because that was the only way we were ever going to defend a pick and roll successfully.   People clown Gobert on /r/nba but he‚Äôs actually relatively fluid and laterally agile for his size which Hassan was not and there was just no way he was going to be able to guard a pick and roll otherwise.
hassan whiteside has entered the chat
He's Hassan Whiteside 2.0.
"&gt;What bag? &gt; &gt;Nobody traded for him because nobody wants him. &gt; He has to have the worst stats to impact ratio in the league.  Two words: Hassan Whiteside. Compare last year's stats to his contract and stats this year. It's nuts. But yeah, in terms of box score stats not contributing to winning Drummond is prolly up there."
"Hassan Whiteside went 100% from 3 one season, put some respect on his name."
Contract year Hassan Whiteside üòÇ
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
And you have to account for the fact that you kinda got rehabbed Hassan. Portland Whiteside was not the worst version of himself in the stat padding regard by a long shot
Blocks aren't necessarily a great measurement of how good a defender is. Hassan Whiteside famously had awesome block numbers despite not being that good of a defender. Because of that I'm taking Player A any day of the week. 35 points is a lot and if he's doing so that efficiently then he could be one of the top guys on a championship team.
"Player A for sure. That is historically good offense and blocks are overrated. Look at Hassan Whiteside as a perfect example of this. He gets tons of blocks, but isn‚Äôt a very good defender at all. He constantly ball watches and moves himself out of good defensive position to chase blocks and it hurts his team more than it helps them."
"He's the all star version of Hassan Whiteside. Lots and lots of rebounds, but does not pass the eye test."
"Ohh man, they should hear about a guy who is getting blocks named ""Hassan Whiteside"". He is getting all the blocks in contract year. Must be DPOY"
Wait until you see Hassan Whiteside stats the last 5 years!
"Well Hassan Whiteside got a minimum contract and had many of the same problems, so I would imagine Drummond gets like 5-8M a year?"
"you mean to tell me that we put in hassan whiteside, then immediately fell apart defensively?"
Holy shit lol is that CONTRACT YEAR HASSAN WHITESIDE?
"As a desperate Kings fan, I do have some concerns:  1) I want to see what they do against a full strength roster. Most of our wins, a big piece has been out (Kemba, Smart, Murray, PG13, etc). Sixers will be a great test.    2) All but 1 of our wins has been by 10 points or fewer. While it's great that they've been good in the clutch, I would prefer that they extend a 10 point lead to 20 and put the game away. Tempting fate will bite us eventually.    3) Our closing lineup of Fox, Hali, Buddy, Barnes, and Holmes has been damn good. But we have been pretty lucky with injuries/Covid. If one of those players has to miss an extended period of time, our lack of depth will be sorely exposed. Sure, I think Bagley is underutilized of late and can play close to 30mpg, but after that, you're giving Cory Joseph, Glenn Robinson, and Hassan Whiteside big minutes, which you do not want at all.  I'm enjoying the ride right now, but I'll have more faith in them if they're playing this well as we get to the end of the 1st half. They've lost my benefit of the doubt after 15 years of no playoffs."
How did Hassan Whiteside get 24m a year???
Hassan Whiteside had such a weird career arc
Better arguably.  Replaced Niang for Rudy Gay and Favors for Hassan Whiteside.
Being a great defender and being a good shot blocker aren‚Äôt exactly the same. See Hassan whiteside
"This is what most people in this thread don't seem to understand.   Bill WAS that much better of a defender than Wilt and everyone else. Bill recorded 40 more defensive win shares across his career with over 100 less games played.    Bill recorded almost 30 more DWS than the 2nd most career DWS Tim Duncan who played in 400 games.    He is without a doubt the most dominant defender of all time during an era where defense mattered more than offense. You cite ""video evidence"" but this is just not good enough. Watching the Wilt archive on YouTube for 20 minutes in no way disproves this massive gap in DWS, titles, rebounding championships, and MVP's.  If we all determined defense off of YouTube archives we would all think Hassan Whiteside is one of the best to ever play.    I'm not saying wilt was a bad defender. He is probably also a top 10 defender, but there is plenty of evidence Bill played defense at an almost unfathomable level."
hassan whiteside is only 2 years younger than andrew bynum
"Gobert changes how you play, he is also better at contesting shots, his advanced stats are way better, Hassan Whiteside used to have like 2.5 blocks a game doesn't mean he's a good defender, AD is a great defender but not Gobert"
"One of these names belongs nowhere near this thread, and that is Hassan Whiteside."
1. Coby White 2. Derrick White 3. Hassan Whiteside  4. Aaron Gray 5. Devin Gray 6. Ed Gray 7. Evric Gray 8. Gary Gray 9. Josh Gray 10. Leonard Gray
"&gt; Curry could average a lot more assists, but the play is meant to end with his shot and not keep going around.  That's a pretty poor comparison.  Curry is an excellent passer, especially when it comes to hockey assists that keep the offense moving.  MPJ is a poor passer, period, and it's going to become a problem when defenses start treating him like a 24 ppg scorer.  Hassan Whiteside and Enes Kanter have been efficient scorers for years but are still a net negative to a good offense for exactly the same reason.  MPJ is good enough to make him a net positive but it's silly to pretend it's not a problem."
In the specific case of Ben Simmons or like Hassan Whiteside I agree that some practice can be largely performative. But it‚Äôs still useful to practice fundamental skills of basketball even if it‚Äôs not your main role in game.   A guy who doesn‚Äôt shoot three‚Äôs may still be needed as a last resort at the end of a shot clock for example. And developing skills takes a long ass time. It‚Äôs still worth it try and expand your skillset in order to become a more valuable player. Guys aren‚Äôt just trying to help their team win they‚Äôre trying to get paid
"Ok, lets take this seriously.   1. Only looking at 2 time all-stars. If you're a 3 time all-star, you're better than Drummond 2. I'll limit it to 80's onwards because it would make contextualizing this easier. 3. Not counting anyone who had recently made their 2nd all-star appearance. Too early to tell  And once you factor those in, only one player comes to mind, oddly enough was similar back then to Drummond  Kevin Duckworth. Like Drummond except a way worse rebounder. Short prime, scored on bad teams, but basically peaked at 26 and just became a rotation guy after that once . his all star seasons were both around 17-7. Didn't pass. Didn't really defend. He was just huge. More importantly, his teams realized they played better when they gave him a lesser role, despite his gaudy stats when playing minutes (the Hassan Whiteside effect)."
"Because none of those numbers are very useful for measuring a players impact, especially players that are offensive role players who get almost all of their value defensively  Hassan Whiteside lead the league in blocks in 19-20. He wasn't even close to the best rim protector in the league. Blocks are a pretty bad stat"
Drummond is a monster in Fantasy though. Disgusting counting stats when on a bad team.  Kind of like Hassan Whiteside
"maybe hassan whiteside   our fanbase is not expecting much at all, i personally dont think hes very good  but fuck it, maybe hes alright?"
"We were the number 3 offense in the nba starting Hassan whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and Trevor Ariza. Tell me dame isn‚Äôt a good playmaker. We are a top 3 offense every year"
hassan whiteside
Hassan Whiteside syndrome. When he was on the blazers I had so many nephews telling me how Whiteside was a lockdown defender and the best rebounder in the league. If you watched us every night it was so easy to tell that he made us so much worse when he was on the floor. Really makes you rethink stuff like blocks per game. Hassan got a shit ton of blocks but in my opinion was not a good rim protector.
Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond
"Russell Westbrook because I can't believe that someone with his athletic gifts can be so dumb with his shot selection.      Ben Simmons because I can't believe that someone with his athletic gifts can be so Inconsistent with when he chooses to be assertive, since when he chooses to be he's dominant.      Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside because I can't believe how someone with his size and strength can be so brain dead defensively and so dumb with their shot selection on offence."
Hassan Whiteside. 100% of his problem is effort. When he tries and is locked in he is effective. 95% of the time he is not sadly
the guy hassan whiteside blocked into 2030
Probably Hassan Whiteside. Career resurgence from the D-league on the Heat into becoming one of the most coveted FA centers into a bench player a few years later.
"&gt; I mean, if Isaac averaged 10 blocks and 8 steals per game, we'd have to give him the award regardless of the season record.  I can't say I agree with that. What you said can still be achieved while sabotaging a team if a coach is dumb enough to keep that player in the game or if the other players really are that bad. Hassan Whiteside for example was heavily criticized for chasing blocks that actually ended up compromising rim protection. Allen Iverson was never called a ""plus defender"" after college because his only defensive metric was steals- for which he was gambling defensive possessions (which worked on a team like the 2001 Sixers covering for him).  &amp;nbsp;  Imagine a versatile bodied guy like Josh Smith for example on a tanking team and winning DPOY"
Hassan Whiteside in 2015-16. Dude was blocking shots left and right for the 3rd seed in the East. The dude was putting up triple doubles with blocks.  Then he was given more offensive responsabilities the next season (and a big contract) and turns out he was just not that guy.
"Bro Hassan Whiteside is literally the poster boy of empty stats, he was the worst possible example you could have used lmao."
"Dwade with league average 3 point shooting or just healthy knees.   Melo with league average defense.  Hassan Whiteside with league average intensity, heart, and passion.   Tony Allen with an average jumper."
"He had a lot of blocks and that was the main calling card for the his argument. His team's overall defense was above average (ranked outside the Top 10), his adjusted +/- numbers were good (not great nor DPOTY worth), and his teams didn't lose too much of a step without him defensively.  The opposing team's offense was similar with or without him in the game.    And that's just statistically. The eye test showed him being very prone to looking for blocks. Not to the extent of Hassan Whiteside like but he'd often leave his feet for pump fakes and find himself out of position.      Not saying he was a bad defender but not DPOTY worthy. There's a couple guys who were more deserving that year (Tim Duncan definitely first comes to mind.)"
"They got Hassan Whiteside. Also Rudy Gay can play some Small Ball 5, something OP of the inital comment asked for."
"Alright Mr. Syrup, let‚Äôs play blind resume.   Player A: 13.3 ppg, 2.3 bpg, 11.3 rpg, 25 mpg   Player B: 5.7 ppg, 2.0 bpg, 9.6 rpg, 29 mpg  Player B is your boy Ben.    Player A is Hassan Whiteside. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna make the hall but I mean I could be wrong."
If the Kings developed him properly I feel like he would have been able to attain a level and role akin to DeMar Derozan on the Spurs. A big guard who can score and be the primary playmaker when his team needed him to.   Kings could‚Äôve been low level contenders if we just developed everyone properly. From 2009 to 2011 Kings drafted what could‚Äôve been a nasty starting 5.   PG: Isaiah Thomas  SG: Tyreke Evans  SF: Omri Casspi  PF: Demarcus Cousins  C: Hassan Whiteside
"the thing that always stands out about jordan highlights are the plumbers he is playing against. Dude with the ball looks around 7 foot, got Jordan in the air on a pump fake then still gets blocked? Hassan Whiteside would have put him on a poster."
"Hassan Whiteside is one of the funniest players in the league, but he‚Äôs gone now.   I think Neemias Queta (on a 2-way) is intriguing though. 7-foot paint protector with some offensive upside. he‚Äôs the first Portuguese player drafted which is cool too, brought some new fans to the franchise"
"I understand what arguable means. My point is that Dragic has no argument for being better than Jimmy. He got a large contract because Pat Riley spends money like it‚Äôs going out of style. Just look at the contracts he gave to Hassan Whiteside and Tyler Johnson instead of Wade, or paying a washed Iguodala $15 million a year.   Being a team leader or the most important guy in the team doesn‚Äôt always mean that the guy is the best player on his team, or even that he has an argument for it. Case in point, Kyle Lowry was unquestionably the leader of the 2019 Raptors, and he was probably our most important player (at least on the offensive end) as well. But despite that, he had literally zero argument for being the best player on the team, because Kawhi clearly was that guy. It‚Äôs the same thing with Dragic and Jimmy."

"Nah, Blocks. Gets people believing Hassan Whiteside is good. Never let your friends believe Hassan Whiteside is good."
Highlights aren‚Äôt all available.  Hassan Whiteside has highlights and is a terrible defensive player
Y'all want Hassan Whiteside?
Hassan Whiteside dad played in the NFL  Caris leverts cousin was the lead singer of the Ojays Popeye Jones son is current NHL player Seth Jones
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid. Guys like Biyombo, Mozgov, Mahinimi, Deng, Parsons, etc. [Here's a list from that summer.](https://www.businessinsider.com/31-best-nba-free-agents-2016-2016-6)"
&gt; Andrew Bynum &gt; Hassan Whiteside &gt; Andre Drummond  Love them all but I didn't get this one. It's supposed to evolve.

Oh man! I totally forgot about Hassan Whiteside. How? He went from doing nothing with the Kings and almost out of the league to kicking butt with us and the Heat almost having the entire NBA think he was a top 5 center and max player for like a minute.
Hassan Whiteside is good defensively because of his blocks
Hassan Whiteside is good at basketball
Hassan Whiteside is a good defender. Have you seen his block stats?
Definitely biased but the Blazers are low key underrated‚Ä¶  Dame  Drexler  Brandon Roy  Aldridge  Hassan Whiteside
Wasn't he considered kind of an empty stats rebounder in Minnesota? Like people were saying he hunted for rebounds so much sometimes to the detriment of team defense. Like Hassan Whiteside hunting for blocks.
Kawhi Leonard - He's a Kawaii  Hassan Whiteside - He's a White Side  Derick Favors - He is a Favor  Lonzo Ball/Lamelo/Liangelo - They are balls  Buddy Hield - He's a Healer  Kendrick Nunn - He's a Nun  Malik Monk - He's a Monk  Harold Miner - He's a Miner  Dragan Bender - He can Bend a Dragon  Devonte Graham - He's a Graham  Dion Waiters - He's a Waiter
Hassan Whiteside
So can Hassan Whiteside. That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a good defender
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
Hassan Whiteside is a decent pickup for the vet min   Hassan Whiteside was complete ass for 20m
"Really don't get how Hassan Whiteside got ejected. All they did was push each other a couple times, they hadn't even been fighting before that. Green likely got tossed because he grabbed a ref, but Whiteside makes no sense."
Hassan Whiteside is a figment of our imagination.
Also in that line of thinking: does one of the greats just end up being hassan whiteside?
Hassan Whiteside lead the league in blocks per game by a wide margin 2 years ago. Do you really think he was the best defensive big that year?
"Was that Hassan Whiteside actually setting a screen on someone? Damn, that's the most unexpected part of this montage"
We pulled Hassan whiteside out of a rec gym and made him a max player Tf you on?
"Dwight, but AD‚Äôs problem is attitude. He isn‚Äôt arrogant, but he‚Äôs too passive. On a scale of Giannis to Hassan Whiteside, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs around the middle, but closer to Hassan on occasion. He bounced back well in R1 last year after G1, but then got hurt, so he certainly can push the pace if he wants to."
"Justice Winslow, Tyler Johnson, Hassan Whiteside...wouldn‚Äôt say always..."
"This sub would fucking hate prime Dwight Howard's guts if he was in his ""prime"" right now. He was like if Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside had a manchild together."
He was Hassan Whiteside. If that's elite rim protection to you then sure.
I will trade you 1 Hassan Whiteside for him.
His backup is Hassan Whiteside so I‚Äôm not surprised.
I HAVE NEVER SAID ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HASSAN WHITESIDE
"Yes, if you cant get Hassan Whiteside to buy in, what‚Äôs the point?"
Hassan Whiteside fell for it probably
If that was true Hassan Whiteside woulda got the bag after the year in Portland
"I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll be enough to get to the finals, but we essentially swapped Favors and Niang for Hassan Whiteside and Rudy Gay while also adding Eric Paschall and Jared Butler. I think the changes are a better fit for our roster and what we‚Äôre trying to do but we‚Äôll have to see how it plays out obviously. I certainly don‚Äôt think the roster is any worse than last year. Almost all of the guys playing significant minutes are back."
"I'm not even saying I think we're incredibly good, I'd argue we have produced more starter caliber players over the last say 5 years, but not trying to big us up too much.  I'm just saying I don't really see the heat that way. Herro and Nunn are both really solid but are only entering their 3rd years, I think Tyler Johnson is fine, Max Strus is not even close to a success story yet, Wayne Ellington is not a Heat Development success, he was a vet that upped his PPG .7 with the Heat and Hassan Whiteside has almost played himself out of the league cause hes the definition of an empty stats centre.  Bam, Robinson and maybe Herro/Nunn (lets see how this year goes) are players you can hang your hat on developing but I'd argue your org is best known for having veteran players buy into coaching and system, not finding coal and shaping them into diamonds.  While we're not supernatural I'd stack FVV, OG, Siakam &amp; Norm Powell against any players developed by the Heat."
Tyler Johnson/Kendrick Nunn/Duncan Robinson/Tyler Herro/Bam Adebayo/Hassan Whiteside/Max Struss/Wayne Ellington. All these guys are good or had career years with the Heat. Raptor fans are either bitter or ignorant. Either way I don‚Äôt care. Super excited for next season.
Hassan Whiteside is an empty calories player.  If he's leading your team in minutes at the big... you got a competitive disadvantage on your hands
"Christian Wood and Hassan Whiteside, but he did it year 5."
"yeah they dont play together, and hassan whiteside is the (current) backup C  draymond would be lot better than hassan whiteside"
"Hassan Whiteside, Harrison Barnes, Otto Porter, Andre Drummond, Al Horford. Max Players at one point, the stretch isn't of the imagination it's of what a max player is. He's not a super max player, but I'd argue neither is Gobert he's certainly a max player though."
"Yeah I mean if you want bench guys to show up and make the stats meaningless, by all means use the per minute version of the stat. I‚Äôm sure you had Ed Davis and Hassan Whiteside as some of your top players in 2016.  Again, Draymond was top 10 in BPM in bball ref. You just saying that he wasn‚Äôt just makes you wrong..   [You can see here, but something tells me you‚Äôre gonna pretend this stat doesn‚Äôt matter despite you being the one to bring it up.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_advanced.html)  And BPM combines offense and defense‚Ä¶ and again, top 10.   Hope your stats work out better in the future"
The Hassan Whiteside vs Ben Wallace one lol
"If Hassan Whiteside can anchor an average defense while Gobert sits, we will be much better than last year."
"I‚Äôm sorry our 4th best player was either Carmelo Anthony or Trevor Ariza and youre laughing at Oubre? Ooookayy bud, whatever you say   Not to mention our 3rd best was Hassan whiteside compared to Andrew Wiggins."
Give me a break.   Dame made the playoffs the year before when our 5 highest minute players were:  Dame  Cj  Hassan whiteside  Carmelo Anthony   anfernee simons  Mario hezonja played the 8th most minutes for us. He‚Äôs about the 10th best player and you‚Äôre telling me the BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD can‚Äôt make it with draymond Andrew Wiggins and Oubre?   Nahhhh
2nd coming of Hassan Whiteside
This is why Hassan Whiteside is Andre Drummond Lite.      Only difference is that in a contract year for Whiteside he becomes serviceable.
"Uhhh good luck with him New York. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've never seen a player lazier than him on the court...besides maybe Hassan Whiteside. Also seemed to have basically no connection with the rest of the team off the court, it was weird."
"I haven‚Äôt flipped any stance. It was a good efficient stat line. Regardless, stats aren‚Äôt the ‚Äòbe all and end all‚Äô because unless the eye test shows a positive influence on the game then who cares about numbers.  You can have empty stat players that make a big impact. Eg: Tony Allen.   Or players with stats that make a small impact. Eg: Hassan Whiteside  The fact is that WB had a good game, solid stat line and a positive impact if you watched the game."
"i was listening to dan patrick the other day , and a Philadelphia inquirer reporter said Simmons is all about making money, being famous, and image  he doesn't actually care about winning   it makes sense given his behavior   he's a cancer, i think they should just trade him for whatever they can get, take the loss and be glad to be rid of him forever  my guess is Simmons is just a more talented Hassan Whiteside. He'll end up bouncing team to team , then fade away."
"It would take longer to list the ones he is better than over the reverse. Shit Cody Zeller is better than him and our bench isn‚Äôt even good.   Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Zubac, kanter, Zeller, Dwight Howard all better just off the top of my head and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting some"
Hassan Whiteside jumped on an Enes Kanter pumpfake once. Anything is possible
Hassan Whiteside fits this description.
Hassan Whiteside?
Hassan Whiteside
got buried because it's hassan whiteside
"Not really the same, we have waaaaaay more firepower than you guys did last year.  Shit we legit started Dame, CJ, Ariza, Carmelo, and Hassan Whiteside and had the 3rd best offense in the league.  Dame, Powell, Roco, Simmons, and Nurk is MORE than enough offense.  We'd still be top 5 in the regular season no problem"
Coby White  Derrick White  Jo Jo White  James White  Hassan Whiteside
Hassan Whiteside defined this
"No Joe ingles, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Rudy Gay.  Let's go, Royce, lmao."
I was watching this [Rudy Gobert vs Hassan Whiteside ](https://youtu.be/VbGnvk23odA) clip and it shows some of the small things that Centers need to learn in order to be effective
Is Hassan Whiteside the new Andre Drummond or is Andre Drummond the new Hassan Whiteside?
Hassan Whiteside only wants one thing and it‚Äôs disgusting.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"If *Dion Waiters and Hassan Whiteside* led the Heat to the ECF, that‚Äôs would be some shit."
Imagine telling this to Hassan Whiteside and the way he'd play lmao.
"Bro, Drummond's ""rivals"" now are the likes of Hassan Whiteside, Robin Lopez and Derrick Favors."
"Rudy gay, Hassan Whiteside, Jordan Clarkson, Jared Butler, Joe Ingles. Oh wait. That's the Jazz's 2nd team... Damn we're deep"
"He has Hassan Whiteside syndrome. People equate the size of his contract with how skilled he is, as if he was just not supposed to sign the contract that would change the entire trajectory of his family for generations because deep down he knew he wasn't as good as Anthony Davis. Drummond (and Hassan) are both still very good NBA players. Starters even! Are they top 10 big men in the NBA? No. But it's not really their fault they get paid too much."
Hassan Whiteside
Hassan Whiteside
This is why Hassan Whiteside is on a minimum contract
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
I think our defense is going to be better this year by default because Hassan Whiteside/Enes Kanter won‚Äôt starting for us for most of the year like the last two years
Hassan Whiteside after signing his $98 mil contract
Hassan Whiteside when he sees a blockable shot in a contract year
Hassan whiteside for bagley
Hassan Whiteside is worse on offense than defence
Hassan whiteside is to defense what Marvin Bagley is to offense
He isn‚Äôt wrong tho.  Dude got paid and checked out mentally.  Hassan whiteside 2.0
"If you had told me that Hassan Whiteside had 0 assists in a whole season, I would believe it"
I can‚Äôt believe you chose a historic playmaker such as Hassan Whiteside.
Fitting comparison to Hassan Whiteside. Players worry when Jrue and Iggy are placed on them while Barea and Kennard celebrate while guarded by King.
No way u just compared lebron to Hassan Whiteside. Lebron was an elite defender from 2007 to like 2015. That‚Äôs much more then a one season wonder and he has more all defense teams then Jrue and Iggy. Everyone falls off a little and Iggy is clearly not at the level he was in 2011.
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
If your team paying 200M for gobert yall aint winning nothing.  Its like a glorified hassan whiteside deal
Holy shit if you are saying he is the worst screener in the league and Hassan Whiteside is also on your team you know it‚Äôs bad. Like how hard is it to just stand there
Hassan Whiteside
"Is legit good or is he Hassan Whiteside 4 years ago good (great stats, not really that good)?"
"Andre Drummond. But I really hope he can do well. I thought him, Hassan Whiteside, and Boogie would be future of the NBA bigmen. Drummond can still live up to that."
You‚Äôd think Hassan Whiteside would be a DPOY if you looked at his numbers last year
yeah and let's not forget that Adrian Mojnarowski guy who thinks Hassan Whiteside is a top 5 center
Christian wood is who hassan whiteside thinks he is
"They have been wrong about a lot of things, including Hassan Whiteside. Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don't sign Hassan Whiteside, don't sign Hassan Whiteside. And now they are saying, sign Hassan Whiteside"
Is Hassan Whiteside injured or just DNP
"you seriously can't compare block totals in the 90s to block totals today  the reason bigs don't average 4 blocks a game anymore isn't because they suddenly forget how to block shots; it's because offenses are less centered around the rim because more players can shoot  if a center averaged 4 blocks today, it'd be at the expense of his teams defense (hassan whiteside)"
"Hassan Whiteside can get you 30,15 &amp; 5 blocks every game. It‚Äôs ridiculous"
Hassan Whiteside and Bagley in 2k are both way overrated
