Trae Young will at least get like Kevin Martin levels of fame as a top 10 scorer who never lead to winning
"KD, Giannis and Embiid are frontcourt too so it doesn’t really matter when it comes to Kyrie and Harden. Those three will be the starting frontcourt for sure though.   Realistically I think only Trae Young has a chance to be anywhere close to Kyrie and Harden in the fan vote amongst East guards. Last season Kyrie barely played and still finished 2nd behind Trae in fan vote and 3rd overall behind Trae and Kemba so just missed out on the starting spot. Bit more talent now in the East, but I’m fairly certain top3 will be the same except Harden instead of Kemba."
"&gt;2 Remaining Spots between Trae Young, Tobias Harris, Malcolm Brogden, Gordon Hayward, Jrue Holliday, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Zach LaVine &amp; Collin Sexton.  Brutal how do you even pick?"
"If the Hawks float around .500 and in playoff position, Trae Young is a lock Bill."
"Lebron is a new generation Jordan, whether he likes it or not his complaining was something that was modeled to young players over the past 15 years.  hoping ja morant becomes idolized more than trae young for the inevitable consequences of ref baiting basketball.  curry changed the game with threes and mj had kids practicing fade aways.  my only true criticism of lebron is his legacy of complaining."
"Even if Harden was red hot in a game, I doubt he would score the same amount of points on someone like Kawhi and someone like Trae Young"
"Yeah, FVV is built closer to Eric Bledsoe than Trae Young haha"
"I don't think there's as big of a gap between Trae and FVV as one might think, due to the differences in defense and leadership. if I'm a contender with established stars already, I would easily take FVV over Trae. Obviously Trae is a better long-term asset to build your team around though and I would do a FVV-Young trade in an instant.   I'm just saying, a team like the Lakers may look at FVV vs. Trae and think FVV is the smarter choice."
"Kyrie and Harden are super established and in Brooklyn so they could pretty easily take the fan voting. Trae is also incredibly popular and I could see him stealing the fan vote from Kyrie. After those 3 I'd say they only challenger is Beal, but his suck ass Wizards aren't winning. Boston hasn't been great but they're undeniably a playoff presence. Worst case scenario I'd say Brown gets in as a coaches pick. Either Irving and Harden get voted in and Brown is the 2nd coaches pick behind Young, or Young gets that starters vote and I think Brown may even get the coaches vote ahead of Kyrie."
Serious question as a Kings fan do you think it would’ve been more enjoyable to have just given your entire team up to Jimmer the past 10 years and have him score 50 out of 60 of your points a game as you lose by 45? Like rookie Trae young hawks but much much worse? I feel like that kind of would’ve been sick
Shoutout Trae Young
Sounds like a great complimentary player to Trae Young.
His rival Trae Young couldn't escape criticism for his antics either despite having the benefit of playing great/winning.
Trae Young played with Vince Carter who played with Charles Oakley who played with George Gervin
To each their own ✌️ I'll agree that he's definitely better looking than bridge troll trae young
"mid range shots are really not comparable as almost every NBA player does them, with 30 ft shots it’s mainly Lillard and Curry, eh on Trae Young- considering there’s two options, and one is better and currently in the league is more dominant at them, OP decided to call it logo lillard range as it’s a corny nickname-"
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.
The craziest thing is probably his lack of FT/FTAs. For a lot of high scorers it’s important they get their calls and go to the line but Kyries finishing at the rim doesn’t translate into a lot of fouls. Could you imagine if he even did half of the shenanigans Trae Young does to get to the stripe?
Trae Young looks like he's about 5'9'' 145 lbs out there though. I don't trust the listed measurements on Trae for a second.
"I mean people definitely complain if a player shoots 15+ FT from intentional foul-baiting, just look at the backlash against Trae Young earlier this season. It's previously led to rule changes like rip-through moves becoming non-shooting fouls.  There is so much precedent for the NBA changing things up to streamline the on-court product. 5-second rule, 3-second rule, limitation of hand-checking, looser definition of gather steps/palming, etc."
"Trae young needs to bulk up, vanvleet and Lowry are both stout which helps them on defense"
"Considering the last few drafts, this draft is hella week at the top. Last years top 5 were Zion (franchise player), Ja (franchise player), RJ Barrett (?). The year before that had Ayton (questionable but potential future star), Bagley (Kingslul), Doncic (Future MVP) and then JJJ (future All star) and Trae Young(All star). I dont think theres any chance that anyone from this group this year is gonna be an all star in the next 3 years."
Trae Young needs himself a Trae Young Jr
I think Fred needs to brought whenever someone says that short guys can't play defense. Its just not true. Trae Young and IT **choose** not to play defense.
Trae young taking notes
I don't see these kinds of excuses that isn't from their own team's fan for Trae Young and Devin Booker when they were on terrible teams
Trae Young time is finally coming
"These are all just straw men though.  Steph has never been a terrible defender, he was bad but like C- bad not F bad.  Harden has always been an solid defender, he just used to be a lot more overt when he would take plays off so there were lots of clips of him just standing there watching people play basketball.  Trae Young sucks and he still sucks, but he went from far and away the worst defender in the league and possibly the worst ever to just normal bad.   Doesn't really sound like a glorious victory but the impact is pretty significant.  Dame is probably a league average or so defender when he works for it but the man has been carrying that offense on his back like nobody else in the league for the better part of a decade.    I don't remember any conversation about Dame being a good defender or making any improvement, if anything its been the opposite.  Kyrie sucks but he's pretty much always sucked.   I don't ever remember hearing any Kyrie defensive hype."
&gt; a la Trae  Trae Young gets calls.  Rookie Trae Young vs Steph Curry resulted in Steph getting mauled with no calls while Trae was going to the line if he got breathed on.
I blame the Adam Silver for letting players game the rules like Harden and Trae Young. Other stars want calls like this too but aren't resorting to completely altering their shooting mechanics into a non-basketball move to draw fouls so they get frustrated with no-calls.
I'm a Hawks fan and Trae Young leaning into every shot trying to draw a foul is mind numbing. He misses ready shots trying to draw a foul. Young guys need to play ball!
Trae young
"Trae complains just as much as Luka, if not more. The king of complaining is still Lebron, and i don't understand why people expect the young guys not to complain so much when the face of the league literally starts complaining while the play is still going."
They’d probably say “who’s Trae Young”
Imagine telling someone 20 years from now that Vince Carter and Trae Young were on the same team. Pretty crazy
"I think he is the only young guy that complains all game. it's not a maturity thing, he is like this, and will probably keep doing this until some teammate calls him out, a la Trae and Collins"
"100% it’s a problem around the league, Trae Young, Harden are two of the worst as well."
"Is this a serious comment? We literally just saw Trae Young throw a fit and start pouting when they were losing.   Luka holds himself above and tries to elevate his teammates despite the circumstances, not put them down even if they are the reason he's losing the most he ever has in his life."
"Bradley Beal is literally not better at any facet of the game than Kyrie. Not one. How tf is he ahead of him and what has he done in his career to be considered a better player than Kyrie? Kyrie has accomplished way more than him and deserves some damn respect.  Trae young last year was insane scorer in a bad situation. Zach Lavine is an insane scorer in a bad situation. There are plenty of great scorers in bad situations, I understand they’re not averaging 34 PPG but weight does that hold when the Wizards are the worst team in the league? You think Beal would average that if he was on a contending team with another superstar?"
Trae Young 28... delete
"I love Trae Young and the Hawks, but you gotta realize that posts like this are one of the reasons people hate on him so much in r/NBA. Can we stop trying to get this sub’s forgiveness and just let Trae speak with his own play?"
i genuinely do not enjoy watching trae young play basketball
I remember the people saying they’d rather have lu Dort than Trae young 2 weeks ago  I still find his stans considerably worse than his haters at this stage though
"Daily reminder that Trae ""Despite the loss"" Young is 0-4.5 billion in the finals  4.5 billion BC-1998, not even born  1998-2018, refused to play (scared of Luka???)  2018-now, speaks for itself"
"💖 Facts I love about Trae 🥵💖 :   2017: He's way to short he's never gonna be good in the NBA. Just because he plays like Curry doesn't mean he should be a lottery pick. We're watching the next bust of the NBA everyone.  2018 (Trae Young gets drafted): Nice so every small point guard that can shoot 3s is automatically Steph Curry? So glad my team didn't draft him. Don't cry if he's a bust when I told you so.  2018-19 season 1st half: He can't shoot he's just a confident shooter. His efficiency is so bad and he's not a good scorer. 2018-19 season 2nd half: He's a ball hawk he should pass more to his teammates. And he's also playing bad teams right now. He's gonna be out of the league soon, never gonna be an all-star  2019-20 season 1st half: He's putting up empty stats he can't play defense. He's can't carry his team to wins. His defense is gonna be a problem. Hawks should trade him for my team for a few picks and a mediocre player because he can't play defense and his efficiency is garbage. 2019-20 season 2nd half: He shouldn't have been an All-Star with one of the worst records in the East. He hasn't even proven he can win. He's only proven that he can lose.  2020-21 season currently: He needs to stop foul baiting. It's not fun to watch and he is ruining the game with it. He can't win without shooting free throws. Once he's in the playoffs he's gonna average 19 points. He can't score on hard defense. Beal should be an All-Star starter over him because he clearly isn't averaging empty stats and also #FreeBeal even though he chose to be on that bad Wizards team and plays to win not to score.  How many times does Trae have to prove you guys wrong again? It's always been popular to hate on him. People are so mad that he isn't a bust that they find every way to hate on him.  Of Course he's not gonna be able to win in his second season. You're drafted into a rebuilding team. Almost no one can carry their team to winning in his first or second season. The Hawks literally had a g-league roster. John was out for 25 games so Jabari Parker was their second player for 25 games. Cam, Huerter, Hunter were all too young to be impactful. Alex Len isn't a starting caliber center and wouldn't even get minutes on most teams. Of Course he can't win with that team. Even Luka can't.  Also people who used empty stats last year have clearly died or something. I hear absolutely no one calling Beal Mr. Empty stats. Even though he is in his 8th season and still can't win. His usage% is also the highest in the league right now and he doesn't pass a lot. #FreeBeal is stupid and idiotic. He chose to be on a bad team and score a lot. Keep the same energy with Beal as you all did with Lavine, Young, Booker and every young guy. And he just said he want to stay with the wizards. Beal is clearly doing it to break scoring records. He doesn't want to win he just wants to score.   Steve Nash: ""That's not basketball"". Also Steve Nash 2 years ago: We're as similar as players from different eras can be."
"Nobody:   Nobody at all:  Trae Young fans: ""what disrespect can I manufacture to get outraged about today"""
Are they though? That city chokes in every sport and Trae Young is a stat padding lollipop body pillow. That team is seriously not good. LeBron should have gotten this statline in the first half. They literally played against the worst defender in NBA history.
Trae Young is averaging more points and assists then Lavine while leading his team to the 6th seed in the east.
"Yes, but everyone likes to overreact. In about 2 weeks it will all go back to normal and people will be talking about how good Luka is and that Porzingis is such a good complement to his game. Something like this happens every other week. Remember how people were saying that Trae Young was done 2 weeks ago?"

"Eh Trae is still a young player at 21. This is his first year on a ""winning team"" and still has some room to grow. He's not a superstar yet but he has everything a young PG needs skills wise.   You're not wrong in your assessment at all. I believe he'll grow into that leader over time this season and wreck havoc on the league next year. Just wait."
If Trae would just try a little bit you’d be fine. I’ve never seen a guy who doesn’t try to intercept passes. Like I think anybody his size who gives effort could play better defense than him. It’s just clear he doesn’t give a shit about it.  I also think he’s gotta pretty terrible body language early in the games. He’s young so I’ll give him a pass but he needs to change if y’all are ever gonna compete in the playoffs.
Trae Young is so boring to watch. He's replaced Harden as the new flop/foul baiting king.
Think about last season when Beal did not make it but you’re right there has been exceptions however only when the player was insane like Trae young for example last year.  Bam and Butler are not putting up insane stats.  They lack wins.   They barely have any games played.
Trae Young is legitimately my least favorite player to watch. His foul hunting makes the game so unenjoyable.
"He’s a rookie, rookies are rookies   Trae young shot 30% from 3 in his first 23 career games"
it's a joke because the other day someone posted the same thing with Trae Young and a bunch of people were picking Dort lol
"Trade him to the Hawks for Trae Young and a draft pick, sounds fair to me.."
tbf Trae Young would barely merit a starting job without his free throws
Is this man down bad for trae young? Yikes
"Tbh Trae Young hasnt come off as exactly likeable. At least coming from the perspective of a non hawks fan. Doesn’t seem like a good teammate on the court, I can see why his teammates been having problems with his style of play"
Trae Young fucked everything up for you guys at the end. Trying go 1 on 5
That’s rich coming from a hawks fan that has trae young
salty we had to watch trae young play a game of basketball
Trae Young is dogwater on defense
Fuck the Hawks and fuck trae young
"In every upvote, there's a Trae Young head snap."
Fun Trae Young fact: He has more FTs made than FGs made this season by like a fucking lot.  Go ahead and downvote me.
"Trae complaints aside, this Atlanta team is hella talented and young, always cool to see teams on the rise like that"
Trae young is going to get hunted every single time in the playoffs. Luka doesn't get chosen every single time like this. It's laughable to compare the two
"Of all the players to get T’d up for complaining to the refs about foul calls, Trae Young should be one of the last"
foul bait then turnover then tech. haha trae young  spoiled
"ref: yo dawg, you ain't trae young, don't be trying to draw no fouls, i give that shit to fuckbois like trae, you better up ya fuckboi game, dennis"
"twerk it, Trae young!"
trae young isn't getting his twerking calls
Disastrous start to the quarter. Should’ve had Trae Young in.
"T-R-A-E Y-O-U-N-G (It's me!)     T-R-A-E Y-O-U-N-G     It's the Trae Young Clubhouse   Come inside, it's fun inside     It's the Trae Young Clubhouse (roll call!)     Collins! (Present)     Capela!

Trae young out here with the 2k cheese
"I’m starting to hate Trae Young. This dude doesn’t even try to make shots half the time, he’s just foul baiting."
Trae Young just got clamped by Kuzma lol
I still can’t believe Trae Young missed All-NBA averaging 30 and 10.
"This is a good learning experience for THT, thank you Trae Young"
Trae Young takeover is what we need
Trae young is just not fun at all to watch. Can’t deny he’s an awesome player though
"Damn I see why all these people hate Lebron, dude really got knocked down by Trae fkn Young, what a bitch"
Trae young accusing someone of flopping is rich
Ball pressure and help on Trae young in transition and pick and rolls has been joke city
Trae Young is the worst and most clueless defender of all time but the Hawks have a top 10 defence so far this season???  Quite curious. It's almost like point guard defence isn't that important. 🤔
Not only are we going to the finals but we have a chance at winning   Lakers can't buy a 3. LeBron is about to pop a blood vessel. Trae young is probably the best pg in the league
Is Trae Young Hitler?
Trae Young flails around more than Harden.
Trae Young out here just foul baiting worse than Harden.  Disgusting
I mean seriously. Fuck Trae Young. Jesus fucking christ.
Trae young taking the Hitler role from James Harden at an astonishing rate
Trae young litteraly punches Caruso in the face and still gets free throws
trae young with this foul baiting bullshit.
Trae young is becoming a more annoying version of Harden
People bitch about Lebron leading with his arms and rightfully so at times.  But Trae Young does it just as much if not more from what I can see
Trae Young looks like a rat
Trae Young not getting bullshit calls lmaoooo
Trae young will never reach MVP levels.
"obviously, you had an ex who looked like Trae Young -- but that's besides the point, what role could Korver possibly take at an adequate level in any defensive scheme?"
He's probably still a better defender than Trae Young.
Uhh right now? The non rookie. LaMelo has a long way to go but he'll probably get there. Trae Young has a couple year head start though.
Do you actually think Trae Young is as good as them right now? Really?
This video was signed and approved by trae young
"i know there arent fans around, but couldnt they have chosen Trae Young to be one of the all stars? which so happens to be in ATLANTA???? get your shit together NBA"
"At least we have trae young😔, he’s the next best thing"
I don't feel bad for Trae Young but I feel bad for Trae Young
No Trae Young selection...
trae young would have won this 3 point contest
"Please god no, please don't argue the guy that got box-and 1'd in the finals and is tripled at half court is guarded less than ***Trae Young.*** Don't argue that a top 5 scorer all time, maybe even top 3 by the time he retires gets less defensive attention than ***Trae Young.*** I get loving your guy, but man, just stop. Theres literally no point in arguing further if you disagree with this."
Just imagine if Trae Young was in this contest! Sheeesh
Is that Trae Young? Out here trying to draw fouls.
trae young &gt; luka doncic
Trae Young.
Trae young and Derozan step on up
Trae young and John Collins about to be called up since they're just chilling at home in Atlanta
Trae young and Clint capela will save the all star game
Him shooting them at an above average efficiency doesn’t mean the team doesn’t want him shooting them often. John Collins made apparently made a comment about the way Young runs the offense and that’s when he had the 7 point game right after. And I did watch that game. He was playing like he was Harden on the Rockets on his last days there. How are you going to tell me that wasn’t selfish play on his part?   No how I feel correlates to reality. He’s played 34 games and the hawks are 16-20 on the season. He has monster games on the regular and they regularly don’t learn to wins or wins frequently enough.   See this is the problem with this sub. I make a comment on how someone is overrated and that players fan base comes out and attacks full force. You saying I only watch highlight mixtapes shows you’re completely biased and have no intention in hearing my  reasoning. I’ve watch about 60% of his games this year and I watch a ton of him last year because I’ve had him on my fantasy team since his rookie year.   I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Trae Young is overrated.
"Early shots are actually the best shots.  Unless you are Trae Young and you are chukking 35 footers, worst shots in the game outside of when Bismack Biyombo ventures outside of dunking range."
&gt;He has the ball in his hands a lot and he takes early deep 3’s often enough to be an issue.  Because we need him to have the ball in his hands. Look at his on/off-numbers. The Hawks have no other legitimate ball handler on the roster. The early deep 3s are perfectly fine as he's shooting them at above league average efficiency from 3.  &gt;John Collins even called him out for the way he runs the offense and the next game he had 7 points on 9 FGA.   He had 7 points on FGA because he didn't care. He was fed up at this point and frustrated with Lloyd Pierce and the situation. If you watched the game everyone pointed out how lackluster he looked and how he didn't look like himself.  &gt;I just feel like his stats and play style haven’t lead to wins even though they have a solid team.  You feel like it but it simply isn't the case. Just watch the correlation of Trae Young having good games to wins in comparison to Trae Young taking a backseat approach and others putting up big numbers to wins.  I.e. John Collins having big games usually has no influence on the outcome in comparison.  Your evaluation sounds much more like someone who watches highlights and quick checks stats. Trae Young is integral for the Hawks success. The whole team is set up around his skillset and when everyone's actually healthy it becomes obvious.
Dude you think fucking Trae young has a shot at the top 3 of maybe the most crowded all time ranking in the sport. Why do you even bother talking about basketball at that point if you're just gonna willfully drop the most ignorant takes.
"&gt;""Trae Young is the 19th most popular player in the league"" is hardly a flex.  I would say being top 20 without being on a playoff team counts as pretty popular.   &gt;Also, last year, he had 2.8m votes on a team that was outside the playoffs.   Yeah, that's hard to do. Last year was his breakout and his team was complete garbage, this year he had a better supporting cast and was held more accountable for their underperformance.   &gt;His popularity is declining as a result of all the controversy with his playstyle.  This is a fun narrative, but I don't think it's actually true from a fan perspective.   He plays on a mid-market team that's performing poorly, and his stats aren't better than last year. His conference also got more competition at the Guard spot, with Kyrie being healthy, Brad Beal leading the league in scoring(and having snub sympathy from last year), Zach Lavine and Jaylen Brown breaking out, and James Harden joining the conference.   If you somehow put Trae Young's perception from last year in a time capsule, and open it up this year, he still gets way less votes.  If the Hawks were where the Knicks are Trae makes the All-Star team pretty easily."
"I just counted it up. Trae was 19th in the league in All Star fan votes. That doesn't seem notably popular. ""Trae Young is the 19th most popular player in the league"" is hardly a flex.   Also, last year, he had 2.8m votes on a team that was outside the playoffs. This year he didn't even crack 1m. His popularity is declining as a result of all the controversy with his playstyle."
So Luka is an average defender.  Trae Young is top 5 worst defender in the league. You forgot that stat.
"And also building around KAT/LaVine/Wiggins with solid role players and more picks along the way.  Plus Rubio.  That would have been just fine.  Take out Saunders death/Thibs and we’ve got LaVine, Markannen, Wiggins and a top 5 pick in the 2018 draft.  Trae Young, Bagley, Ayton or Doncic  Saunders trusted the process.   Thibs sold it for win now."
26/9/4 in his 3rd year and his coach just got fired but its his fault the Hawks are mediocre.  Trae is a liability defensively but you can still be a great PG and be a liability (Nash) and also have a winning team.   A lot of careers are defined by how bad the organization is run and it will always be reflected mostly on the young star which is dumb
"I honestly feel bad for Trae. To be that good at such a young age, exceed all expectations so far, but still gets hated so much. Last year he was the “worst defender of all time”, he’s gotten better in that aspect. Now it’s “He only scores cuz of foul baiting”. Even tho lots of players do it. Ppl just love to hate the kid, if he stopped foul baiting completely they would still find something to hate. And every game thread is a bunch guys commenting on how ugly he is. Like when the fuck has that ever mattered. Guy just goes out, plays hard, sets his teammates up, and generally looks like he’s having fun and ppl can’t stand it lol"
Don’t let this subreddit fool you. Trae Young is pretty popular outside of here.
Most people outside Atlanta are not huge Trae Young fans.
"I like Bill Simmons but dude is the king of using hindsight. Atlanta made a draft night trade, and it was a bad one - one they would undo if they could. But guess what, shit don't work like that!  As is, they got a great player in his own right in Trae Young. As a Magic fan, I would kill to ""lose"" a draft night trade and end up with someone as fucking awesome as Trae is."
Yea Bill Simmons trae takes are bad. Trae young is a damn good player himself and I think will be a future hall of famer
"He has a chance to be a top 10-15 player ever at this rate. Trae Young is really good so the trade isn't looking nearly as bad as it did two years ago when he started off his rookie year as a dumpster fire, but they're probably regretting it. Not nearly as much as the fucking Kings lmfao. They deserve to be clowned eternally for that."
Bill Simmons hates Trae Young
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
"&gt; Not just anyone can average 14ppg.  There are actually a lot of players in the NBA I'd reckon that if you gave them about 15 shots a game they'd score 14 a game.   &gt;Shot selection can be coached,  &gt;so it has nothing to do with his jumper and instead with his tendency to try and pull up like dame   Which is what I and his coach at Georgia, Tom Crean, are both echoing. He has shown time and time again it's very difficult to coach him because he's going to play how he wants to play. Fuck, Crean basically worded it that way when he came out.   &gt;Ah yes, Rookies have shown all their potential in their first 30 games  Typically they get half a season and that is indicative of their long term growth, especially so for guards/wings. That's just the principle I'm sticking with, could not be true for Ant but history says otherwise.  &gt;Your low IQ take is the reason why people called tre young a bust in the suboptimal first half of his rookie year.  Well since we're tossing barbs you need to lay off the copium. Trae might've been shooting poorly but he was still affecting the game with his playmaking and, amazingly, is putting up around the same rebound numbers as Edwards. So, even with Young shooting like absolute dogshit his rookie year, he's still somehow better than Edwards was.    You're enjoying watching Ant camp up at the 3 point line and just watch the game? Not play help defense? Be completely unengaged unless he's playing hero ball or is the focal point of every possession? Damn, it's almost like this is the kind of player he was at Georgia and still is and might always be and the kind of player your franchise drafted.   Once again, big red panic button but you're far gone on the copium."
"What? Flopping is highly frowned upon in the nba by players. Trae young gets lambasted all the time.  Look at soccer, that’s a sport where diving isn’t ridiculed at all. Yet, I find the officiating in soccer to be extremely consistent."
Trae young snubbed again
I want to see Trae Young posterize Tako Fall in an actual NBA game. Impossible? Probably. Improbable? Certainly. But it'd be a hell of a highlight. David v. Goliath.
The Trae Young stans were even worse.
"So you think Trae Young is like, really old?"
Only thing i have grown to dislike is what Trae Young has been doing. Outside of that the rest is part of the game.

Make that shit Trae Young does an offensive foul unless he gets his feet set like a defender taking a charge.
That’s Some Trae young shit
*looks at Trae Young*
"I'm getting extremely tired of this take that Jokic is a bad defender. Statistically he rates out as solid, above average, and your take about post defense is especially laughable - that's what he's arguably *best* at defensively. He's good in the post. He's good at positional defense and is almost always in the right spot. He's very good at hedging on PnR and recovering to his man, generally. He is tied for the league lead in total steals meaning he has active hands and plays passing lanes. His biggest weakness defensively is defending high screen and roll with a ball handler who has *elite* speed/quickness and pinpoint passing pair with a roll man who has truly *elite* athleticism. There's only really one team in the league who has a pairing like that right now - Atlanta with Capela and Trae Young. And at least part of that struggle is because Denver's defenders often get caught on picks and struggle to recover to their man, which leaves Jokic in the position of having to guard Young and Capela at the same time... which is impossible for all but the very best defenders in the NBA.  And for a bit of proof on Jokic's post defense, lets look at how he fares against Embiid, shall we? Since Embiid is one of the few players who still posts up quite often. They've played each other 5 times and here are their respective stat lines:   Embiid averages 19.8/11.2/3.2/1.2/2.2 with 5 turnovers and 4.6 fouls shooting 37.7/16.7/82.6 in 29.7 minutes per game.  Jokic averages 21.4/8.2/7.0/1.2/0.8 with 2.2 turnovers and 3.4 fouls shooting 48.8/25.0/83.3 in 31.9 minutes per game.  You also undersell how far ahead Jokic is as a playmaker/passer honestly. If Jokic is ""bbq chicken"" (which he isnt, for the most part), Joel is the same as a passer. His turnover rate is by far the highest of any player who scores 20 or more ppg, and right in line with his career average. He still struggles to make the right play passing out of double teams and doesnt often feel the double team coming well. Jokic conversely is one of the very best passers in the NBA, period. There are a couple players I'd put in the conversation with him, but it's a really, really short list."
Trae Young would have got that call
"Now imagine Gobert doing this to Trae Young, its not just a legal play because Embiid is strong enough to somewhat absorb the contact"
HE won a game against Atlanta by drawing a charge against Trae Young too. Unbelievable.
And Trae young is still as good as Luka doncic amirtie? Hahaha
Go and watch Trae Young or Steph Curry play and you’ll see calls 100 x worse than that every night
"U said trae young is an average starting point guard, ur deadass braindead cuz i think all ur breaths have been wasted already. Like u should be concerned about whether ur brain is getting enough oxygen"
And the only miss was from near 90% ft shooter Trae young lmao
Trae Young should be an all-Star. McMillan leading this team to a bright future
Trae Young friendliest whistle in the league
Well Trae Young isn't elite at anything and is an average starting PG so...
He's not a superstar. What about andre roberson at his peak. Was he better than trae young?
"Embiid, Lowry, and Trae Young fit that description perfectly"
On this list the only guys he might be better than are Buddy Hield and Trae Young
"Well most likely, the media would go insane, house of highlights, ESPN, bleacher report would be posting it non stop. It would probably make Shaqtin a fool, some memes might come out of it, very similar to the Nate Robinson knockout. r/nba would be happy and Trae Young would be a laughing stock by NBA fans. The teammates would probably try and pretend it never happened as it would be in bad grace to make fun of your teammate especially if he’s the star player of the team. It might be used occasionally in locker room arguments and behind the teammates back but that’s as far as it would go."
Anyone else excited for the Trae Young rule to be made
"Donovan ""Trae Young"" Mitchell"
MCW &gt;&gt;&gt; Trae Young
"You've made a bunch of assertions here, but have provided exactly ZERO evidence to back them up. How about you provide some actual hard numbers or statistics to backup what you claim? Otherwise it's pretty clear you probably havent watched the guy play. ""Lacking the ability to get to the line"" is mostly a cop out - the dude constantly finishes through contact and gets hit and just makes shots anyway. The only reason he doesnt get the FTs is because he actually tries to score those plays instead of accentuating the contact like Embiid, Luka, Harden, Trae Young, and the other noted foul hunters.   To counter your point that he gets ""devoured"" by the ""elite bigs""... who you have in mind, exactly? Embiid? Hmmmm let's check that out. Jokic and Embiid have played each other 5 times in their careers.  Embiid averages 19.8/11.2/3.2/1.2/2.2 with 5 turnovers and 4.6 fouls shooting 37.7/16.7/82.6 in 29.7 minutes per game.  Jokic averages 21.4/8.2/7.0/1.2/0.8 with 2.2 turnovers and 3.4 fouls shooting 48.8/25.0/83.3 in 31.9 minutes per game.  Huh. Interesting. I'd say Jokic has gotten the better of that matchup pretty consistently and most would say Embiid is an elite big man. The same is generally true of KAT - Jokic tends to own him. He also owns KP if you want to call him elite, and... who is really truly an elite 5? There aren't many, other than Jokic and Embiid. Even AD (who is a 4 and insists on playing the 4 as much as possible), Jokic does mostly fine against. Not going to stop him that often but most people arent. There is ONE archetype that Jokic struggles with and there's only really one team that has it - he struggles in the PnR with teams that have elite, super quick ball handlers paired with a fast and springy athlete at the 5. There's only one team that has both of those things - Atlanta. Trae Young + Capela, but it only works because Trae Young burns the Nuggets perimeter defense putting Jokic in the position of choosing between two players to guard. No one can guard both of those guys 2-1 except like, Draymond Green, Simmons, and maybe Embiid.   The Nuggets also have a pythagorean win expectation of 24 right now, which says that their record will improve in the second half of the year and they should probably end up at least in the top 5 in the West. Maybe higher depending on how other teams fare, but I think 4-5 is where they'll end up.   So again, you can miss me with your false takes."
"Trae Young only being 16th is a big surprise. An even bigger one is that Lonzo is just behind him at 17th, though that may say more about the Pelicans than it does about Lonzo."
Luka was already amazing at that point in 2018.  Ayton was a double double machine already.  JJJ averaging 1.6 blocks in 36 games of his rookie year.  Trae Young in 36 games averaged 15.6 and about 7 assists.  And Collin Sexton averaged 14.7 points in 37 games.  &amp;#x200B;  It's safe to say that there isn't much upside potential yet with this class compared to the previous two classes.
"His numbers per-100 possessions are actually worse than his MVP season, it's just the per game numbers that are similar. The efficiency is down a bit too, as you said.   The 113.3 -&gt; 98.3 ORtg drop when he's off the floor is hilarious. It's like Trae Young [last season (112.8 -&gt; 98.4)](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612737&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1629027) and to a lesser extent [this season (117.2 -&gt; 106.5)](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612737&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1629027)"
"I don’t disagree, but often times I felt like her post game questions were to softballish. there are to many other clowns over there who for whatever reason elect to create negative narratives around the team. Hell, last week some AJC boomer wrote an article about how Trae young shouldn’t be an all star using the most brain dead and inconsistent logic I have seen."
178 is basically a pickup game between Harden and Trae Young
Man I really wish the hawks could put it all together. Cam Reddish/Clint Capela/Trae Young/DeAndre Hunter/John Collins would be a really good frontcourt. Hopefully we can see it in the 2nd half
"Not as much as he should , he drives to the rim the most in the nba and is at 7.9 FTa. Closer to Jeremy grant than to Trae young for example."
"The refs stop play with a bullshit call seemingly 1/2 the possessions. There's basically no such thing as a guard driving the lane and NOT being gifted free throws. I've said this before, but I'll say it again: this is on purpose.  We're in what, year 6 of Harden throwing his head backwards and automatically getting a call? The NBA claims the refs watch game film and review calls on their off days so they can improve. If that's true, how are they still falling for a flop that's supposed to look like Harden is getting clotheslined 5 times every game? Everyone in the world knows the flop is coming except, apparently, the people officiating the game.  They have to know Trae Young is going to jump sideways into a defender and throw up a desperation heave. They still give him the call.  At this point they have to know these things are coming. And the refs reward and encourage it to happen anyway. And any questioning of this is immediately meet with a technical foul or ejection.  I'm not saying officiating is easy. I don't demand perfection. I enjoy college basketball even though the officiating isn't very good. But come on. This isn't a case of inexperienced officials who are just doing their best."

"Vince Carter was old enough to play against Nique’s hawks, and then play for the hawks with Trae young while Nique was commentating it"
"Steals are a terrible way to measure defense, Lu Dort and Trae Young are averaging the same amount of steals but they are clearly not the same caliber if defender. And advanced metrics are notoriously bad at quantifying defensive impact. Though looking at the stats which ones is Jokic leading in because the only one I see is DBPM. And if we go by that metric it would make Jokic the second best defender in the NBA which makes me feel like that stat is flawed."
Has to be Trae. Young up and comer with the potential to become a superstar. He got denied an all star game invite which is similar to Anakin not being granted Jedi master.
"It would need to be a gifted young guy who plays with emotion, who fell just short of the All Star game (equivalent to the Jedi Council). Trae? Which would make Vince the Obi Wan"
"This doesn’t get said enough.   The way the rules are written allows for interpretation of actions.   On a side note, this also results in players like Harden and Trae Young getting a lot of hate for the way the play. They’re using the officiating to get to the line and get free points; it’s not their fault, it’s the leagues. I don’t like watching it either, but hate should be directed at the NBA not the players.  This is something Silver is definitely going to address in the future."
"Defense matters overall, but individual offense is much more important than individual defense. That’s why you Trae young is a better player than Lu Dort."
"Counter argument: Defense matters overall, but individual offense is much more important than individual defense. That’s why you Trae young is a better player than Lu Dort."
Trae Young was labeled a bust in summer league
"Defense matters overall, but individual offense is much more important than individual defense. That’s why you trae young is a better player than lu Dort."
Slightly different but Vince Carter had been teammates with Hakeem Olajuwon and Trae Young in his career lmao
One that will definitely be mentioned in the future is Trae Young and Vince Carter played on the same team.
"Idk about underrated. Harden undoubtedly has a huge impact, but he’s been toxic his whole career. I will say that he has impressed me with Brooklyn so far and he seems to be breaking some old habits.   But Harden’s unwillingness to play off-ball has been absurd for so long. He won’t even make the simple pass—he only passes the ball if its got assist potential. This doesn’t make him a bad player by any means but it does basically take his teammates out of the game, turning them into tools that occasionally are called upon, which is frustrating to watch for fans of team basketball. His tendency to draw touchy fouls from beyond the arc and get away with travels is also annoying. He also forced his star teammates off his team and then demanded a trade because his team isn’t good enough. This is why he’s disliked on the sub, but disliked is different from underrated.  As for the influence he’s had on Trae Young and Luka Doncic—a lot of the traits they’ve picked up from Harden are not necessarily good things. Both players need to learn to make the smart, simple pass, and to play off ball.   Lastly, to your point on Curry—talent level, sure, but Curry doesn’t drive his teammates away. Draymond and Harden?? That’s not a team, that’s a fight.   So I don’t really agree with that."
"Atlanta Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk proudly waited outside the visiting locker room to give Trae Young and the players on his victorious new look team an appreciative fist pound on Tuesday night. Injured forward De’Andre Hunter yelled out “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kevin Huerter gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Rajon Rondo yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Young hit the locker room door, former NBA great Dominique Wilkins hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Ah yes, Jamal Murray and Trae Young putting the league on notice defensively"
"Low IQ: Trae Young is awesome, look at all the points he scores!!  Medium IQ: Trae Young is a flopping bitch who doesn’t play defense or winning basketball. Players like him don’t deserve to be all-stars  High IQ: Trae Young is awesome, look at all the points he scores!!"
[Bleacher Report] Was Trae Young Sandbagging Lloyd Pierce in the 4th? 😱 Find out here!
Trae Young doing star shit
He’s an average shooter who thinks he’s Trae Young
"1. Effect is the noun. Affect is the verb. The Hawks affect Pierce by firing him. Him not having a job is the effect. Source: am professor of English.  2. I think Trae Young has a budding reputation as having a bit of an ego problem based on reports that have surfaced around him the past two seasons. I'm not saying you're wrong. You make a great point. I just think coaches are viewed differently when the players they don't get along with have a reputation for being difficult (SVG-Dwight, D'antoni-Melo, etc.)  3. This is an interesting point, but the Hawks are literally one game back of the play-in game. Coaching them to the playoffs would be undoubtedly better for Lloyd Pierce. I don't think McMillan turns this around, but who knows. I also don't think Lloyd Pierce is the best head coach, but I know that he's helped develop some nice players for the Hawks and other teams.  4. The original point still stands. It's okay to feel bad for Lloyd Pierce even though he makes more money than us. It's a bad situation. Plain and simple."
"Curry was bad, I mean really bad, like Trae Young bad his first few years. By his first MVP season, he picked this up and was pretty close to average and people still acting like he was awful we’re just wrong.  Harden was a defensive liability because he didn’t really try and his IQ on that side of the ball was well below average. As he kept getting better and older, his IQ progressed too. The last few years he just clearly hasn’t tried, kinda like Bradley Beal last year. He too is a average-a little below average defender when he puts the effort in.   Dame has just never been at their level. They are both MVPs, he is not that so it’s not judged as much. He has been about the same as Curry. I wouldn’t really tag any of them as defensive liability, just not amazing ones."
Trae Young as an answer to both of those.
"Literally just weeks ago: Is Zion underrated? Why’s no one talking about him :(  Literally last week: Zion **18th overall in fan all star votes** lol   Fuck no he isnt. And market or team success ain’t no excuse either. If you’re really popular you’ll overcome that. Whether it’s a recent case like Trae Young, or go further back. I’m old enough to remember grant hill was an all star starter almost immediately.  Penny Hardaway too."
"KAT doesn't contribute more to winning because he's on the timberwolves this is complete nonsense lmao. If you put KAT on the Jazz they get even better than they've already been. Kat has all the tools to be a great defender too, it's just hard to do so when you're carrying the offensive load for your team AND you're surrounded by terrible defenders, AND you've had horrible coaching your whole career.  I'd comfortably take Kat over Gobert and would take Bam over him as well. Gobert has great defensive instincts but other than setting screens and catching lobs he has no other offensive skills which always bites the Jazz in the playoffs.   This is the same bs that led people underrating Booker last year, or Trae Young, or you can go back historically and use it for guys like KG too. Just because a player got drafted to a losing franchise doesn't mean they don't contribute to winning.... Gobert is a good player in a great situation, don't let that fool you into ranking him over great players in absolutely shitty situations"
T[Trae young speaking to JC Cam reddish and Clint Capea in the Hawks locker room ](https://youtu.be/Bflkr8_cocM)
"Oh I love Harden, I almost forgot how much I did during the Rockets era at times. But now that Trae Young exists the foil baiting doesn’t bother me as much from James lo  He’s a WORLD CLASS playmaker, passer, hell even point guard as a label. The dude is amazing. He just isn’t as efficient in his assisting when weighted vs turnovers as the all time greats in that regard.  See Prime CP3 or apparently Prime Jokic lol"
 Donovan Mitchell or Trae Young
Today I watched Trae Young toss up half court shots. Each one made me sad that the beautiful game of basketball is dwindling away  - jps78 /s
"Tbh I actually think of it the other way around. I think a lot of these older guys are more soft than the younger guys now a days. I look at DBook and DMitchell and Joker and Jamal Murray and Trae Young and all those guys are hungry af and they seem like they genuinely look like they want to create a culture. I mean look no further than the Jazz/Nuggets playoff series, that was intense basketball, and all these guys have a fire I’ve seen in 90s/2000s basketball that I’ve felt NBA post 2015 has lacked. A lot of the “all stars” or today are ring chasing, whether that be LeBron or KD (really anyone on the Nets) or Kawhi (personally don’t consider clippers a super team but whatever) or even Draymond himself when Warriors got KD. The more “experienced” guys seem to be worried less about creating a culture and more about winning a ring, which I get that’s the ultimate goal, but there’s a difference between being someone great like AI or Chuck or Reggie Miller or Dame who stuck with their teams and all those guys who joined up with other all stars to get a ring imo."
The hawks got trae young who I would consider better than pascal right now and Indiana is a way better balanced team right now
Yeah there's obviously a racial element to it. Nobody calls white guys crackheads. Hell people don't even necessarily call biracial or light skinned people crackheads. Trae young is biracial and he gets called methhead/meth curry all the time on here.
Trae Young because Ice trae  K I’ll see my way out...
Trae Young will have a better career than AI
" I think the better question (in my opinion) would be, ""who would you rather have, Ja Morant or Trae Young?""  I say that because they play the same position, but dominate in two completely different ways. It is almost like asking whether an apple is better than an orange or if a banana is better than a grapefruit. To me, this is all a mater of preference, and the Trae Young vs Ja Morant debate is not much different in my eyes.  So if we were to infer who is better based on ""who you'd rather have"", I'd answer like this:  If your team is stock full of defenders who need offense who may or may not be knockdown shooters, then Trae Young would be the better option.....  If your team has a crazy amount of three-point shooting but needs a guard to open up the floor by playing the drive and kick game to increase the gravity of your shooters out on the perimeter by drawing bigs and secondary defenders to bring help on drives to get shooters open, then Ja Morant would be the better option...  If you're a team who has a bunch of 3-and-D wings and bigs who can shoot as well (like the LA Clippers), then you cannot go wrong with either...  All in all, I see and agree with both sides of the argument. I can understand the argument for why Trae Young is better and I can understand the argument for why Ja Morant is better.  Talent-wise in a few years (2-4 years), I think they are both very, very, very similar and equivalent in the amount of talent each point guard possesses. However, they play the game two opposite ways, so to me, this is all a matter of preference as I mentioned earlier.  Do you prefer Ja's remarkable athleticism mixed with his fast-paced, drive-and-kick game or Trae's unreal shooting with his playmaking deriving from his perimeter-oriented skillset opening the floors for cutters, or if a double team on the perimeter comes, another shooter?  It's truly all a matter of preference because I think they are equal in talent, just depends on how you want your PG to approach the game if you are a coach.  That's the way I see it."

"Yep, it’s pretty much this.  He isn’t even an efficient offensive player, and he plays Trae Young defense"
Number 1 is absolutely a lie. I saw a thread of “who is better Ben Simmons or Trae Young?” And read some of the worst takes of all time.
"If a car is tailgating you on the road and they rear end you because you came to a stop, the car that rear ended the 1st car is the one at fault for the wreck. Same applies to basketball. Trae young is a man who knows his insurance policy very well, 15 minutes on Gieco can get you 15 free throws in a NBA game."
Nash said the same thing about Trae young lol
"Harden Rockets, Trae Young Hawks, Doncic Mavs are all heavy iso and PnR offense  A lot of players on those teams are not uninvolved nor unhappy. I bet Wiseman could be a better contributor being in a PnR offense"
"If Trae Young starts getting into MVP conversations and if his teams reach the caliber of some of Harden's teams, you can bet he's gonna draw just as much hate."
"This isn't a new theory it's just a fact. People hated Harden even before the FT baiting got to a ridiculous point. Trae Young isn't hated anywhere close to as much as Harden is.  Also, I literally don't like Harden for the reasons I wrote about lmao"
"Why are fans coming up with new, ever so weirder theories on why people dislike(d) Harden? Look at Trae Young, same shit, just an inferior player. It's incredibly frustrating to watch him play against your team if you're a fan of anyone other than the team he plays for (mostly the Rockets, since I haven't noticed it as much this season)"
If the choice is early 2000's watching Kobe do his thing or AI isoing up cutting to the hoop vs. Trae Young shooting a 3 as the ball swings around the arc Id take the former every time.
"Hawks, a team with their best player as Trae young, who cannot dunk in game, have the second most dunks. Lmao"
"It's not. You switch on everything now. 1v1 don't really mean anything anymore.  Mavs v Clippers you would think PG and Kawhi should have been able to be on Luka for 60 minutes, but that ain't happening  The team with the worse defense matchup 5v5 is gonna get roasted. Switch on Trae Young every possession lmao"
him and trae young both
"maybe if you throw in a few scrubs like trae young, clint capela, and oneka okongwu, and turn the picks into pick swaps we could consider parting with deanthony melton and maybe also killian tillie or jontay porter"
Trae Young is also an atrotious defender
I don’t know if you know this but trae young is definitely a tier above
I definitely am thinking Lavine (due to standing) and Kyrie (if he missed any more games) won't make it to All NBA this year. CP3 and Booker may split voting between them. But there's also Ben Simmons and Trae Young on the peripheral as well.
Then why aren’t people saying he’s one of the best PGs in the league? Why are they saying trae young is a tier above him(keep in mind I actually really like Trae young)
I’ve been seeing people say Lavine and Trae Young are on “another level” compared to him
"Acting as if you won an argument by calling people names is more about you being the childish one. Murray is the better defender, playmaker and has less usage than Lavine by a ton. And he has also proven himself in the playoffs. What does lavine have going for him aside from scoring which is not that huge of difference when you compare their overall skills. Onto Trae young, the foul baiting, defence turnstile of a player who only has Murray beat in play making whilst also being ta worse shooter. Your argument failed the moment you started talking about hypotheticals and started to project your ineptness onto me. Good luck from wherever you are but seeing that you need to put the last word in, go ahead bro."
"Trae Young is much better offensively than Lavine, because he can get to the line a lot/playmakes really well  Jamal Murray put up 40 points to win a game 7"
Trae Young will never be on a serious competing team

Trae Young a shot jacker. Dude is shooting in the low 40's from the field.
"&gt;LaMelo is going to put up 20 per game 10+ assist seasons on the regular  Trae Young is already doing this, and he's 16th on the ESPN list."
"he gets lots of calls in different situations. Rip through dont tend to lead to real shots for any of the players who do it often, whether that is Harden, or Trae Young or Embiid.  I am not talking about the tough body finishes he gets too."
Super underrated for sure but you are forgetting Trae Young
"1. It's obvious that you haven't watched JJJ play  2. The Grizzlies were missing 4 key players, both teams were banged up   3. The Grizzlies were also on the second night of a b2b, and ours were both on the road   4. Fuck Trae Young"
"trae young is on the list and Lonzo ball isnt ranked over either of those guys. If you mean Lamelo, id probably disagree with you on that Lamelo&gt;Jaylen Brown if we are going off of potential"
Grayson Allen cooking Trae Young?  Say what you want about him but he backs it up when you talk shit about him.
Son of Zodiac - the Trae Young biography
"You saying that Trae Young, a player that has broken several NBA records already at the age of 22, is not a top 16 player under 25 currently in the NBA is either pure stupidity or just you being salty.   I’m not naive obviously those are two different things, but injuries aside the Mavericks have still been extremely underwhelming.   I mean you guys have an overall better roster than the Hawks and we’ve been plagued with injuries just as hard or probably more than you guys and record wise we’re relatively close to you guys.   Regardless, Trae’s offensive output is almost exactly the same as Luka’s, just like last year, except there’s no empty stats excuse because they’re actually winning."
"Harden, Luka, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, SGA"
yeah trae young didnt play tonight
Trae young look like a lollipop wit cat hair on it
"Grayson Allen:  10/18, 3/9 from 3, for 30 points  Trae Young: 6/17, 0/4 from 3, for 14 pts.  These are just observations."
"I would take Trae Young easily over SGA, Fox, Brown, and lately Simmons."
"And that’s even worse.  AI is an MVP and one of the greatest scorers of all time.  The only thing he didn’t have was a championship and only idiots on the internet think that’s career defining.  No team figured out how to stop him they just had to be thankful he didn’t have help and that Father Time caught up.  Trae Young has nothing so far and has proved nothing, compared to AI.  He has put up empty stats on a non contending team.  AI dragged a similar team to the playoffs every year.  He got scoring titles over Kobe, TMac and Shaq.  Trae Young would have to become a fundamentally different and more impactful type of player to even compete with AI’s legacy."
In what realm is Trae Young a support player lol
"Lol  Trae Young absolutely will never be better than AI.  AI carried a team with pretty decent defense and no other offensive threats to the NBA finals.  You are high if you think Trae Young will ever carry a team to the NBA finals.  In 2001 the Lakers swept three fantastic teams.  They swept the Portland Trailblazers (jailblazers).  They swept the Kings who would go on to get cheated out of a finals appearance the next year after outplaying the Lakers.  And they swept the Tim Duncan/David Robinson Spurs.  The only team that beat them the entire playoffs was the Sixers, but even that is disingenuous because nobody else on the Sixers played particularly well and they didn't really shut down Shaq, who scored 44 with 20 boards and 5 assits shooting 60.7% fg.  The only reason the Sixers stole a game from arguably the most dominant team of all time was because AI scored 48 points with 6 assists and 5 steals.  The Lakers kept bullying their way back and every time they did AI was there with a clutch shot, no matter how hard Shaq hit him every time he came in the key, or how aggressively they doubled teamed him at the perimeter.  Trae young is a very good young player.  Get the fuck out of here with calling him better than AI nephew."
"I vehemently disagree. Derrick Rose had a good defensive team, but he was that teams entire offense. No other shot creators, and lots of injuries that year. Trae is a talent but that’s ludicrous to say, especially when there have been so many good young players recently."
"You guys went 11 for 11 from deep including a couple of Trae Young shots inexplicably went down. When a game makes me think ""I'll feel better emphasizing with Subaru's suffering in Re:Zero*"", it's bad. Really bad.  *This comment is not meant to disparage Re:Zero's quality. It is in fact a fantastic anime, and the first season at least should be on the watch list of every single anime fan. But the premise involves putting the cast through a whole bunch of mental torture."
"It’s tough to answer because it depends on the situation but in a vacuum Young.  Simmons could be better if you surround him with legitimate scorers but he’s useless as a first option or even a second option on offense. Trae obviously is bad on defense but defensive flaws are easier to mask.  So while I can see Simmons “leading” a team to a ring with elite defense averaging like 14/9/8 he would still be extremely dependent on his teammates and it also takes a very specific roster.  With Trae, you just need good defenders around him and a legitimate second star and you’re rolling. Don’t need to do a bunch of gymnastics to build a roster."
Been watching reddish since high school he was the best player on the court in u-19 USA games. He pushed point for team USA he can’t flourish on hawks because trae young dribbles too much he needs the ball in his hands. He gave the nets 24 in a close loss this year and dropped 28 his rookie yr when trae was out and they almost won he’s a stud walking 24-7-5 just needs the ball in his hands and a system catered to him.
"Trae young, obviously. More tools. Trae is better than Simmons and it's not even close.  Trae has a cabinet full of tools. Simmons has a hammer."
"As a Hawks fan, I firmly believe we should trade Trae Young while we can, he will never be part of a serious title contender."
Trae Young not being in the top 10 of ESPN's top 25 NBA players under 25 is acceptable
Trae young with embiid would be disgusting. (in a good way)
Our defense would go from very good to atrocious with Trae Young instead. Ben is amazing on help defense and can hide the defensive deficiencies of Curry and to a lesser extent Green.
Ben Simmons is a horrible fit with many superstars because he cannot do much of anything in the halfcourt offense. That is debilitating especially in the postseason. Ben Simmons best role would be like draymond. Slot him in as a pf next to a dame lillard or Steph curry. Meanwhile Trae young can pair up with any sg/sf/pf/c and it’s no issue. In fact he’s likely gonna make all those guys lives easier cause of his playmaking. Ben Simmons paired up with a big man like say Joel embiid is a big issue because ben Simmons has to hide in the dunkers spot whenever the game slows down cause he is useless on the perimeter. It is painful to watch that and see embiid have to post up against a guy and have another guy ready to help cause ben is so close to the rim. You are sleeping on how limited ben is in the playoffs.
"And? Allen Iverson averaged 6.7 assists in his career and had many years in the high single digits. I think Iverson's slightly better defense easily counters his lessor assists to young. Trae young highest steal average is 1.2 a game, and under 1 for career. Iverson led the league multiple times in steals and has a career average of 2.2 a game.     Damn you and your edits. I never said i would win a ring building around simmons. I like my chances better with him than young. NEITHER are winning you a ring as the #1 guy though. Both need another all star min."
"Trae young honestly, you can hide him if you have good to great defenders and he's one of those players that is an offensive system in itself  Especially if you're building a franchise around them, I'd rather have ben as my second or third best player"
Young isn’t just a scorer he avgs 10 assists a game  Trae young is already one of the best passers in the league while being a fantastic scorer. Trae young is gonna have a better career than iverson lol.    And again just lmao if you think you can build around ben Simmons and win a ring
"I feel like simmons would be a more versatile person to build around whereas trae young is a better first option, therefore i ultimately think a team anchored with ben simmons would do better than one lead by trae young"
"Ben Simmons, defense is very important to me, he’s far more likable, and I have a thing for big PG’s  And I just hate watching Trae Young play basketball"
"Trae Young. When the playoffs roll around, Simmons becomes nearly useless in a halfcourt offense. He becomes a one way player, just like Trae. Except Trae's offense is far more useful than Simmons defense as someone to build a team around."
"Whatever you say my man. I really don't care enough to push any narrative about Trae Young. He cut down on the foul baiting it, but absolutely still does it. He's a great talent but i personally don't find his game appealing. Has nothing to do with what everyone else is saying. That cool with you?"
"Marvin Bagley - kid gets an unreal amount of hate from r/nba for having the audacity to get injured and get picked ahead of Luka.  Rooting for him to show out once he gets to a better organization or a better coach.  Westbrook - I think he's the ultimate, ""do you play ball and so can appreciate all the different things a player does on a court"" or ""do you just parrot whatever Zach Lowe blogbois say about the boxscores"" divisive player  Trae Young - thought he was an undersized goofy looking troll that was gonna get eaten up in the league when he first came into the nba.  Kid is really fun to watch though and anybody pretending he's not already a star needs to be corrected."
"Trae young is an incredible scorer while being one of the best playmakers/passers in the league, him being bad defensively does not make any of this less impactful. Dame is an atrocious defender on the same level as Trae but no one is calling his offensive production 'less impactful', guard defense is overrated."
Looking like Trae Young.
"The point is still proven though, this isn’t a team judgement thread, it’s Trae Young. To say he isn’t a winner now is ridiculous"
Trae Young.

mfw Looka Donkey is worst defender than Trae Young

Trae? If Bulter or lavine should even be considered then Trae young should be in there as well
Trae Young is absolutely reviled.  You can replace Lonzo there with literally any decent role player and it'll still be at least 50/50.
"What a fucking joke man. I always felt like maybe Hawks fans were exaggerating how much disrespect Trae Young gets, but time and time again the hate just gets more blatant as Trae continues to dominate."
1. By far Kobe Bryant   Allen Iverson  Trae Young  Dominique Wilkins  Dwayne Wade  Derrick Rose  Lebrun James  Magic Johnson  Durant   Westbrook
Keep that same energy on posts about Trae Young and Harden
"Embiid flops alot lets be real...many times it looks like he doesn't look to score and just throws the ball in the air... not saying he doesn't get hacked time to time, but alot of it is him pulling trae young type stuff"
Dude Trae Young and the Hawks eliminating the Celtics in the 4/5 series might close the Ringer down.
Unless Trae Young is involved and then it's no longer basketball
"Yeah, Trae Young famously brought his team to remarkably high highs his first two years in the league. What spot did the Mavs end during Luka’s freshman season? Oh, they went 33-49 and finished 14th? Wild!  You’re just afraid of anyone being compared to Luka. It’s fine, you can look like an idiot for calling a player averaging 26.4/7.1/3.5 on 66.2% TS% a “tier below” someone who has played professional basketball since he was 16."
Trae Young hate threads
When you're a better 3pt shooter than Trae Young you gotta let it fly.
"Well the Hawks do have Trae “balding Steph” Young and Kevin “Redhead Klay” Huerter, so..."
Luka and Trae Young
16th best player under 25  Trae Young
"Trae Young clearly isn't a top 10 player under 25. He only went 6/7 from 3, with several of them being only 36 footers.  ESPN is the best sports media platform and their rankings are the best in the league by far.  /s"
Trae Young made it to the all star game on that.
Trae fucking Young
Trae Young &gt; Jordan Clarkson
"I don't think that's the case at all? If you look at the responsibilities of a guard, it is definitely much more involved on the offensive end.  What ends up being the deciding factor is probably selection bias and defensive expectations. Centers are expected to play defense whereas Guard defense is nearly always swept under the rug (See perennial all star Trae Young).   Add on to that you only get in the NBA as a Guard IF you show you have the offensive skills. That alone makes them significantly more ""NBA ready"" than someone like Giannis who is selected for physicals alone. However, it doesn't mean it's ""easier"" to be a guard.   **Tldr; You can get into the NBA as a big man by being big. You can get into the NBA as a guard by being good.**"
Does trae young call his own fouls?
It’s a lot different in a 1v1 setting when you only have to focus on the guy your backing down. If Shaq had his 100% focus on trae young while backing him down it’ll be BBQ chicken all day

 &gt;There is no way that LaMelo will be better than Trae Young when they reach their full potential based on how they're playing right now.  And you're calling them stupid lmao
lol shaq would move above average looking centers like furniture and this dumbass thinks trae young will strip him
"99% of ref/foul hate is dumb.  What are trae young, harden, and embiid floppers but jimmy is a guy “who plays the right way”?  People just hate whoever they want to and make up refereeing decisions to justify it."
Trae Young 0 points next season confirmed
"It's not going to affect anyone that much I think, maybe Trae Young.   Harden is good and smart enough to not need gimmicks, which are not as big part of his game as people on this sub think anyway,"
"&gt;In the offseason, the NBA plans to address the unnatural shooting motions of star players like James Harden and Trae Young that get foul calls under the rules in the NBA -- but would get eye rolls on the playground.  Lets goooo"
"&gt; Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
Coach of the year belongs to whoever reads Reddit and decides to get a win by making Trae Young shoot the mid range
"I mean idk about hate, but if you mean criticized, it’s because he’s a pretty limited player and gets overrated at times.  He is a low efficiency volume scorer, above average playmaker, and one of the worst defenders in the league. It’s not exactly an ideal recipe.  The best way I’ve seen him described is essentially a poor man’s Trae Young. Trae gets criticized enough already, so you can imagine how someone that scores less on worse efficiency, is a worse playmaker, while sharing the awful defense criticism of Trae would get more than that.  He just isn’t good enough on offense to justify being one of the worst defenders in the league."
"In regards to guard defense, point of attack just doesn’t matter that much relative to the whole picture. Trae’s bad defense doesn’t have the same effect on the game that, say, average center play does. Randle increasing his shot was fantastic but Lebron’s playmaking is miles and miles ahead of anything Randle did this year. Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game. Lebron’s defense more than makes up that difference, again in my opinion. I read in another post about why you left Harden off, and that is fine (esp as a rockets fan).  I think Trae is the most underrated offensive player in the league, and his playmaking is near the top of all players. Some people don’t like how he draws the bs fouls but until the rules change it will be a way to make points and Butler is a worse offender anyway. All in all good list though, just seems we disagree on a couple small things. Kawhi is hella underrated, I think because he is a boring person/low brand exposure. He is killing it this year and his defense is nuts. For reference, my list:  1st: G: Luka, Curry; F: Giannis, Kawhi; C: Jokic 2nd: G: Lillard, Harden; F: Lebron, Zion; C: Embiid 3rd: G: Irving, Young; F: Butler, George; C: Gobert"
"Randle’s playmaking, rebounding and 3P% really did it for me. I was shocked at how well he’s played even though his FG% is really average. I considered Kyrie over PG, but honestly PG’s defense put him over the top for me. Realistically with Trae Young’s defense (which was pretty horrific) I couldn’t put him in there. We’ll see these next couple of years, though. Young will probably be up there soon"
"You need to look at Randle’s efficiency. His counting stats are inflated because of his minutes totals. He is at average efficiency. He’s had a wonderful year but I can’t see him as anything outside of third team given Paul George is a guard. Lebron has been amazing this year, especially defensively, I don’t think there is an argument for that flip existing. Finally, Butler has had a wonderful year but team record when out is extremely noisy…who else was out when he didn’t play? I have him third team with George as a forward. Irving and Trae Young have had fantastic years for guards. Beal’s season is very overrated because he scores a lot of points. I see him more similar to LaVine’s season as opposed to something that would get him to third team. Harden and Irving and Trae are the biggest omissions. I’m gonna assume Durant not playing half the year is the reason he missed your cut (perfectly fine with that but you didn’t mention it in your “left off” list). I don’t think Paul has been good enough to make an All-NBA team with how stacked Guard is right now, his team doing better than last year seems to be leading the charge for his contention but that doesn’t really play out when comparing his stats and watching him play compared to other guards (Irving, Harden, Young). Otherwise pretty solid, seems like the easiest center year to rank in a while. Gobert is the entire defense by himself basically, the on/off stuff for him on that end is extremely good. I don’t think Bam is close to him."
Trae Young should be captain of that team
"Erik Spoelstra, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Kings game. You need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"Steph, Klay and Draymond could be playing together under Steve Kerr in Bumf\*\*kville, Montana and they still would get top tier free agents if they had the cap space. Clippers on the other hand only needed to show half as much competence to get their two stars. But even if they didn't make those moves, I'd wager that they make the playoffs this season with an all-star SGA leading the team. You have to actively try to suck to be as bad as some of these franchises. Forget Doncic, the Kings could've drafted one of Trae Young, Shai Gilgeous Alexander or Michael Porter Jr. at 2nd and they still would've most likely been a play-in team this year."
Gtfo my dick. Trae young ain’t shit either
"Saying ""even Steph Curry"" was his way of saying that even the greatest shooter of all time goes through slumps so we shouldn't overreact to an obviously worse shooter going through one. You just heard Steph Curry in the same mention as Trae Young and automatically took it as disrespect. If any shooters going through a slump like this especially Trae whose usually a pretty good shooter considering the shots he takes their will be a comment mentioning Steph Curry because his shooting is iconic."

Trae young isn’t one of the best shooters though. It was very clearly a comparison broski. No need to Stan it up cause you have to as a hawks fan... Though I’m not surprised.  Saying “even steph curry” is a comparison in and of itself to try and say “Trae young isn’t a bad shooter because steph curry has an occasional off night”... yeah steph curry also has 40% from 3 on much higher volume not 34% like Trae...
It happens to steph for 1 game.. not 5 in a row.. Trae young is not nor will ever be steph curry

Trae young
Almost like guys in their 30s one of which has won mvps is held to a higher standard than Trae young
When premier stars are missing it helps other players get more attention. It's just a fact. Trae young numbers and shooting aren't really different from last year when he got attention.
At least you got Trae Young out of it
"He's one of the guys that comes to my mind whenever the question of who would do better in today's league than in their own time. Dude was splitting pick and rolls and shooting 3's off the dribble back then and was great at it. In today's league he'd prob be similar to Trae Young, maybe not in production but definitely in playstyle"
"He’s definitely taking the Trae Young route — play horribly to start your rookie year so everyone forgets about you, then ball out the second half of the year and hit the ground running as a sophomore.   He may not start the all-star game like Trae did, but I would not at all be surprised to see him average something like 24-6-4 next year."
Can’t believe Trae Young invented fouls
Did trae young invent the +1?
Trae does it a lot but at this point I feel like there are so many people who foul hunt by leaning back into the defender that you can’t call it “pulling a Trae young”
Do people think Trae Young invented foul drawing or what?
Trae young
Trae young biggest foul baiter borderline unwatchable at times
Trae young for the foul baiting
"Trae Young. I liked him but watching Hawks game, the guy flops way too much and I've started to hate watching him."
"Lakers Clippers no question. Total bloodbath with narratives flying all around. Clippers getting bounced out the first round would lead to some beautiful off-season headlines. ""Where is Kawhi headed to next?"", ""Are the Heat favorites to sign Kawhi?"", ""Why is Kawhi's jet in Miami"", ""Does Kawhi think he can save the Heat from their embarrassing first round defeat at the hands of Trae Young and the Hawks?"" etc."
Call him overrated but there’s no way Trae Young is better than Kyrie lol
"I’ve always thought they should be a tad bit more flexible with it. They shouldn’t completely disregard positions, like Trae Young shouldn’t be voted in as a forward or centre, but they should be somewhat flexible. I especially believe this for centres considering they only have 1 spot on each team while guards and forwards have 2. That in itself isn’t fair."
Guess Trae Young doesn’t have a position then
trae young to both john collins and clint capela
Then I guess it’s all about regular season to you. I bet you think Trae Young is better than LeBron since he averaged 30 and 11 assists 🤣
Trae Young being a good player and a foul baiter are not mutually exclusive things.
Daily reminder that trae young twerks on people for free throws   /s

"Not really. We were still trash outside of Trae and JC. The young players weren't ready yet (Hunter, Reddish, Huerter) and the rest of the roster is basically out of the league."
Trae young got a lot of hype last year becuade other premier gaurds (curry and kyrie) to name two were out all year with injury. It pushed young to the top more. This year he got ignored because of locker room issues early on and the fact that no one actually thinks the hawks are good. Add in the fact that teams out west have had major shakeup in the standings and the Knicks being good and yes trae young falls in terms of topics that get discussed.   Saying media gonna median is just lazy shit.
"No, it’s not. It’s clear he won’t be better than Trae Young and MPJ."
Also trae young
"I think Trae Young is HEAVILY underrated among a lot of NBA analysts for some reason, he was getting snubbed like crazy on under 25 lists it was baffling. Look what he's doing with a competent coach"
"Tell Scott Brooks that you need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"Think of Trae Young, although the did go 5th a lot of people didn’t think he was going to survive in the NBA, and don’t forget Trae was a wayyy better shooter, now think of that but this time his jumper is a lot worse."
"Yes. When I think of Trae Young I think of his deficiencies as a post up defender, which is of course the primary way he is attacked"
"Reminds me a bit of Trae Young with his court vision and ability to finish at the rim despite his height. Has turnover issues and isn't a good shooter. Given the shit the NCAA put him through, I get why he wanted out. If he can develop a shot, he could be a real interesting prospect. If he can't, I think he'll be a solid backup."
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."
Trae Young will win a playoff series before Luka. Guarantee it.
THEY DON’T TOO SEE US WIN. TRAE YOUNG DOESN’T PLAY REAL BASKETBALL
He's like Trae Young if Trae Young couldn't shoot
"Scott Brooks, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Kings game. You need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"I wouldn’t say so but they are pretty close.  Both are damaging scorers so it depends on do you value Russ being a better shooter (lowest of bars) and maybe a better finisher (debatable) with better rebounding and passing over Simmons much more elite defense.  For PGs I’d have Russ clearly below Steph, Kyrie, Dame, CP3, Jrue, Trae Young, Jamal Murray, and it’s debatable if he’s better than Ja Morant, Lowry, FVV, Ben Simmons, Conley, Kemba.  He falls somewhere in that range.  I’d personally have him 11th behind Lowry, Morant and Simmons but you can argue he’s better than those guys.  Ultimately it’s his efficiency tha hurts him because even his bad defense can be excused as a guard but I’d feel much better about him if he shot less and just focused on more of his awesome rebounding and playmaking."
"Wizards defense: ""We have you now!""  Trae Young: ""See you...in SNELL!"""
"I’m not the biggest Trae Young fan, but I really hope he makes a conference finals before Luka just so everyone that has anointed Luka a god can sit down for a minute."
"Boy I hope Hawks fans ready. Once the playoff audience get a hold of Trae Young, they’re gonna kill him for the foul baiting on a level they haven’t seen yet"
Bro trae young plays like a such a pussy. Great passer but man.
Wizards terrible defense on trae young
"Gobert hate is really weird and irrational. His issues get amplified 10 fold by fans, same thing with Trae Young"
"But the main argument with Beal his his scoring. That is Beals position and place in the league. This is not like comparing Dame and Giannis with PPG because obviously Giannis brings way more than just his PPG. If you can't see how using PPG as an argument with Bradley Beal over Trae Young makes sense, I don't know what to tell you."
"Bro why are you whining you guys are the 4 seed. People know Trae Young is a good player, some people just don't like his playstyle and that's okay. He's a 43% fg guy who averages 9 FT attempts a game and some people don't enjoy that. If he's as good as you think he is and is an all-nba guard you'll have a great playoff run"
How dare you suggest that Malcom Brogdon and Trae Young aren't the same player /s
I believe he had for the guards Steph and Luka first team.  Dame and Harden second.  Trae Young and I want to say Kyrie third team but it might be Booker I would need to double check.  As a caveat he has Butler and Paul George as Forwards.  Also he doesn't dock missing games unless its more than half the season like KD.  His thing is basically getting the 15 best players for that year on the team regardless of missed time again unless it's over half the season.
"You’re so mad it’s hilariously. I would be too if Trae Young was my starting point guard, though Westbrook isn’t much better. I feel you, know that one day, an effective, winning Poiny Guard will lead both our teams to success."
Because i’d rather spoon my eyes out than watch trae young iso and draw cheap fouls?
"Trae isn’t better. He’s one of the worst defenders in the league, Beal is average. In terms of scoring Trae really is only better at hitting threes. Beal is a better slasher/ scorer at the rim, he’s miles better in the mid range. Young has no mid range game, which leads him to have some extremely rough games when he’s not hitting threes."
"I genuinely don't understand how anyone could have the impression that Trae Young is overrated.  Discussion about him is either generally negative, or even if it's complementary, it has some negative caveat about his playstyle or defense."
"That’s when it starts though. A lot of players hit their stride at 22-24 when they’re done growing, understand the routine and get acclimated to the physical toll of the sport.   If you got a young player suffering right now and he’s sub 25 years old if they’re showing flashes when everything settles down they’ll be consistently better if not make a dramatic leap.   Which puts the fear of god in me for dudes like Luka, Trae, Mitchell, Murray by all accounts they should go up a level in the next year or two."

"Were talking about who will be better at their peaks. Not who's better right now. You're also comparing 3rd year trae to rookie lamelo, so traes got the advantage. I think its absurd to call it clearly anything, they're 22 and 19 years old and 2 of the best young players in the league"
MPJ is not better than trae young. His potential is higher though
Yeah... that’s the Hawks injury list but for around 50 games this season lol c’mon.   Are you really trying to argue MPJ is better than Trae Young?
"Considering he creates his own shot plenty, in a much wider variety of ways than Trae young. your statement was simply mind boggling. I don’t think you’ve seen how much Beal has turned into a superstar shot creator"
"Ball... 6'7"" versus 6'1"". Skills are similar and Ball has 2-3 years to get to current Trae Young level."
Embarrassing take. We didn't have our starting C for 2 of the 3 and the one game where the Hawks were healthy they got embarrassed by 44 by Randle. Not to mention the 40/11/6 game he had in January.  No one is afraid of the Hawks. The majority of your stars points seem to be when he jumps into another guy to draw a fake foul. It takes a lot to become the least liked young star in the league and Trae has done that soooo quickly.  Personally I'm hoping for a Knicks/Hawks series so we're well rested going into the next round.
"Shaq on the Hawks: ""They're playing well. McMillan's doing a great job and Mike Bibby is playing MVP caliber basketball."" Adam Lefkoe: ""Hold on, he doesn't play right now. It's Trae Young."" Shaq: ""Whatever his name is."""
It’s a joke bro it’s really not that serious lmaoo. I love Luka and I’ve loved watching the Mavs since Dirk and I love trae and what he brings to the city the trade is honestly a win win in my eyes because we both got very talented young guys. I’m not gonna let social media narratives change how I view players and create false rivalries when Trae and Luka have been cool with eachother since draft day
Trae Young is a vastly superior passer than Steph. Trae Young is capable and has been top 5 in scoring and passing. He's by any definition an elite playmaker. Doncic too.
"Who is a better player. Trae Young or Kevin Durant? Considering what you think is important, why isn't Trae more valuable/better considering his combination of volume scoring and playmaking? I'm assuming you think Doncic is just way better too right?"
That headline reminds me of that one youtube channel with clickbaity titles which gets like 500k views: Trae Young DESTROY Kyrie Irving ankles and becomes SUPERSTAR after Kevin Durant wants FIGHT him.  And the grammar is that bad
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
"And the teams he coached didn't have superstar talent, in both cases (Portland and Indiana) he had middling rosters with just some ""nice players."" Coaching is important but can only take a team so far, this is why the teams that advance in the playoffs every year have star-quality players.  btw I'm not saying this to say that he has that in Atlanta, that's yet to be seen and it depends on the growth and development of Trae Young. But if the Hawks cannot take that next step within the next few years, I will be the first to say it probably isn't because of Nate McMillian, it would be because of the development of guys like Trae, Hunter, and Collins."
Trae Young I fucking hate myself
"Trae Young, oof"
"I mean this is what teams do, it's what the Wiz did last night, but Trae Young happens to thrive in that situation. He leads the league in floaters, he's very deadly from that range, and in the P&amp;R.  It might just be a situation of the right guy with the right personnel. Pacers have talent, but Brodgon doesn't do what Trae does (as good as he is)."
And Trae Young can be the offense instead of him having to come up w something so it kinda solved y’all’s issue

People are poking fun at OP for this follow up of previous analysis posts that essentially boil down to ""Wizards should play drop coverage against Trae Young"" but much longer with lots of clips.  Honestly, none of this bothers me, but the last little tidbit of this post about thinking the reporter read his reddit post is kinda what led to my snarky comment."
Trae young had more free throws than our entire team
How to adapt to it? Why do you need to adapt when Trae Young gets an open floater on every possession? That shot is money for him. He went 10-15 from 2fg tonight.   Trae was also +18 in the minutes he played.  &amp;#x200B;  I just don't see how this game was a testament to the coverage working.
East has young stars too between Tatum Trae Sexton bam Giannis (still pretty young) Simmons lamelo
"Maybe I'm lower on Trae Young as a defender but that guy is a genuine turnstile, I feel like I'd get by him   Anyway hope you guys keep up the wins down the stretch"
Trae Young 15 threes when
Trae Young should be on an all-nba team
"There were in the bonus  They were against a backcourt of TRAE YOUNG AND LOU WILL  They have 3 all defense player, one is the runner up MVP and the other is the runner up DPOY   Tobias Harris finished the season as a 20ppg guy on 51/39/89 splits  Seth curry put up a career-high 36 pts including going 7 /12 from 3  Up 26 late in the 3rd  How the fuck  It's easily one of the most embarrassing losses ever"
Trae Young drew one of those jump-into-the-defender fouls and took 3 free throws to take the lead. Unlikely to have a highly upvoted thread about it.
And good luck playing trae young and Lou will in the same lineup vs a team with a real offense.
"Legit I don't know what Doc should've done in this situation. He had all the guys out there he really should have had out there at the end of the game. The team was flat and played like shit. They needed to make stops to end the Hawks run, but they literally can't put Ben Simmons out on the court without ending up losing at the free throw line.  If there's a singular dude who should be blamed for their 4th quarter troubles, it should be Ben Simmons. He's an all-nba Point Guard and All-Star who is shooting fucking *thirty percent* from the line in the playoffs and does next to nothing for your offense. And it's not like he has been slowing down Trae Young either, he has been flat useless outside of a blocked 3 point attempt. He is being exposed, *hard.*"
Trae Young is good
"""Like, are we SURE the Hawks are good? All we hear is Trae young this Trae young that, but......  Clint Capela? Always outplayed in big games with Houston  Nate manikins? Never won in the playoffs with Indiana and Portland  Bogdan? The guy who put up empty stats on the nets/kings  John Collins? The guy with that awful dunk contest attempt over a plane  The Knicks, with a possible COY and MIP and defense and those crowds lose to........ that""  This was the text of that post lmao"
"I was a Trae Young skeptic.  I thought he was too small to be effective on defense, so that he would give up on that end as much as he got on offense.  I thought he was an inefficient and streaky shooter, that fooled people into thinking he was better than he was because he looked great when he was hitting, but terrible when he missed.  I thought he was a ballhog who piled up assists by being the only person allowed to hold the ball.  But, he's been a legitimate winning player, and I was wrong."
That's why Trae young is about to head to the conference finals while luka donchoke works on his freethrows 🦧 what a smooth brain thing to say. Get off the internet it has melted your brain kiddo :)
Trae Young is quickly becoming one of my favorite players in the NBA. This is his breakout year in terms of leap to superstardom.
And Trae Young won't be on any of those teams!
I watch good teams play sir. If they end up playing the hawks I'll tune in to the trae young show. An mvp player is not an mvp player when injured. Same goes for players like trae.
"As a pacers fan, I personally love the plight that trae young has brought upon New York and now philly as well. I’m sure this comment will come back around to bite me in the future too. Dudes seemingly gonna be around for a while doing this to every team"
"He already has one. We got Trae Young, Lou Will, Tony Snell, Nathan Knight, and the ghost of Kris Dunn. We're loaded!"
Youll be even worse off with 5 players with no offense. Lou williams and trae young just beat 3 all nba defenders
It was looking like Dallas got the better player to me.   But Atlanta built a better team and Trae Young looks just as good now.
"Only starter with a negative +\- as well with -10. What a comeback from Trae Young and the Hawks though, for every choke there is a great comeback on the other end. And Trae was 🔥"
"Best comeback since yesterday*  FTFY  But nah fr one mans choke is another mans comeback. You either can slander Giannis (undeserved) and Simmons (ok he probably deserves it), or you can appreciate to superstars in KD and Trae Young dominate."
Okay so why is thybulle not as good as trae young  Elite offense shit defense elite defense shit offense  I’ll wait
Wasn’t Trae Young an all star in his 2nd season?
"Trae Young putting the city of Atlanta on his back. You love to see it. People can shit on the Sixers all they want and rightfully so, but I prefer to just appreciate watching Trae become a superstar before our eyes."
"Trae Young is gonna be an Atlanta legend some day. Hope he turns around the curse for them, if anyone can do it it’s him. Just thrives under pressure"
Pat Bev vs Trae Young 🤣
"Trae Young outscored the 76ers 13-6 in the final 6 minutes... what another clutch performance by him, we’re watching a superstar in the making"
Trae Young scored 13 over that same stretch. Love watching him play (for now... may change my tune if we play him lol)
This isn’t correct. MSG chanted “F&amp;$# Trae Young” in game 1 and lost. They then chanted “Trae is balding” in game 2 and won.
"He put up 37 on a bad knee, I don’t care if it hampered his play in the 2nd half, this game is not on him. He was dominant in the first half and the reason they built such a big lead in the first place. Simmons scored 8, Tobias scored 4, those are the all-stars you can blame. Oh, and Trae Young."
"""Trae Young eats pussy"""
Least the falcons made the championship game n lost to the goat. Sixers losing to Trae young n lou will
"* Trae Young makes beautiful floater over 7 footer while getting fouled no less than twice *  * Embiid Flops *  EMBIID IS DOWN HOLDING HIS KNEE. Give Trae a shout man, that was a tough shot. Announcers were loving Embiid tonight."
I know right. It’s amazing how much the hawks and our All Stars like Trae Young get overlooked
"Its a low iq take to refuse he did anything wrong. Embiid had a great game, it doesnt change the fact that he choked at the end to give his team a chance of OT. Any player in the same scenario would face the same criticism in the same situation. Imagine if ghe made both, then trae young missed HIS 2 free throws and the sixers scored a bucket. Everyone would say he choked regardless of if he scored 60 points or not. A great game does not change the fact that he choked two crucial FTs."
Trae “Sumail” Young
"Trae ""Tom Brady"" Young"
Trae young 19 free throws? Oof
"You do realize that doing 2.1 points better/game and 1.1 rebounds better/game don’t matter nearly as much as doing 4.5 assists better/game, right? It’s not like Lavine is destroying Trae in scoring, but Trae is absolutely crushing him in facilitating, nearly doubling up Lavine in assists.   For subjectivity, Trae has higher bbiq, more poise in tough situations (two comebacks vs the 1 seed in case you’ve watched any basketball lately), and is a proven leader of a team that isn’t in the gutter of the eastern conference. I’m sure the Bulls will be better at some point in the next few years, but it sure as hell isn’t the current situation.  Still, the Jaylen Brown &gt; Trae Young guy probably doesn’t care about much except for hating on Trae."
"Mitchell is fucking jacked with a crazy ass wingspan (6'10 wingspan IIRC?), physically speaking the dude is about as far removed from Trae Young as it gets."
Trae Young shot 17/19 from the free throw line (89.47%)  Are point guards supposed to be good at FT’s or something?
"Honestly, with how Trae Young is looking, he might end up an all time great too."
Paul George and Trae Young competing for the playoff villain crown
"Oh absolutely. I've always been super high on Trae and think y'all run this year has been super fun to watch. He really is proving that he is a growing fast into a winning player.  Just thought it was weird that it was considered ""disrespectful"" to say that Luka is better than Trae. They're both great young stars."
Remember when Ben Simmons made the all star team and Trae Young didn’t? That was really dumb
I really liked the bubble experience. I’ve been a casual lebron/super star fan so it was a lot of fun watching him have a another strong run. The last full finals I watched was 2016. This year I’ve been watching games most nights they’re on if I’m home and watching basically every playoff game. I like how close everything has been so far for the most part. Lots of fun players to watch still. I’m fully in the trae young finals mvp camp now after tonight.
It’s too simple to just blame Doc. Game 1 for putting Green on Trae? Yeah that’s on him. And he could have done better in places.   But blowing two 20 points leads in a row requires failures everywhere. That Philly couldn’t score late when two of the five worst defenders in the entire NBA were on the floor in Young and Collins isn’t on Doc. Simmons being unable to hit uncontested free throws isn’t on Doc. Harris being an absolute zero isn’t on Doc.
"Avoid Twitter and Facebook at all costs! I don't think these people are actually true Hawks fans IMHO (let alone Hawks fans at all, more like trolls and sh##posters). They seem to hate Luka and the Mavericks more than they like Trae Young and the Hawks. Even Luka and Trae don't even have any ill will toward each other."
"How can it be argued that it was good for both teams?  Luka is 2x first team all NBA. Trae did not even make third team.   Luka is the best player this young since LeBron. Luka is a top 10, arguably top 5 player and he's not even close to his prime.  Sorry, but the Hawks lost this trade no matter how the playoffs turn out."
"He's an incredible player for sure. He has the potential to be the best Atlanta player ever, even over Nique. Still a long way to go but Trae is the truth. As far as young point guards go, the league is in a good place with guys like Trae and Ja."
it's the hawks catch up  trae young can't be denied
trae young is a star
Trae Young is absolutely a star
Trae young is a star and this is not an outlier year
trae young is not a star. He's just a really good player having an outlier year.
"Are you kidding ??? What the **** are you talking about man ? 76ers are a biggest looser i ever seen in my life ! They was doing PIPI in they’re  pampers when trae was beating players much more stronger then them! They are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, they are like a girl crying after trae beat them! Be brave, be honest to them and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that trae is very good blitz player, trae can win anyone in the world in single game! And ""b""en ""s""immons is nobody for trae, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what 76ers say about Kawhi ) !!! Stop playing with trae name, trae deserve to have a good name during whole my basketball carrier, trae is Officially inviting 76ers to BIG3 blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of them will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all!  Trae suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at trae results in 2019 and 2020 regularseasin , and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, Trae Young is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about trae like that, they will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off..."
"And all year there were posts asking ""Would you rather have Trae Young or Derrick White"", ""Would you rather have Trae Young or Lonzo"" and most people didn't pick trae. So, my point stands."
"Those “would you rather have Ben Simmons or Trae Young?” posts where Sixers fans made it clear they would obviously choose Ben every single time are pretty funny to look back on, ya gotta imagine if Trae can lead a team to 3-2 over the 1 seed that his defense isn’t horrendous enough to make him a negative.  I get why they said it tho, and I reaaaallly fkn hoped he would prove himself this playoffs, seems to not be the case... Philly should trade him, would love as a Blazer fan if it was for CJ and picks or something but maybe Philly can somehow get something more  even as Ben shows he isn’t capable of being a playoff threat."
&gt;trae young and luka trade wasn't lopsided at all?
Last I checked he was shooting higher volume and % from 3 than Trae Young.
"Uh, pretty much all of those points you made are why ""Trae Young"" is not an acceptable answer to the question of what happened."
The Grizzlies are lucky they happened to stumble upon Ja Morant the following year. Could have looked really bad not getting Trae Young and getting JJJ instead.
That mfr Trae Young...
"Apparently you are not allowed to defend Trae Young. He's basically getting 2019 Harden level treatment. You breathe on him, foul."
"I can't speak for other Hawks fans but my perspective is basically this: would I have loved to draft Luka? Of course, he's a generational talent.   Am I upset that we drafted Trae Young? Hell no, I'd take a bullet for this guy 🥺"
"Trae Young really turning into the coolest, most badass villain in the East"
Shit even Embiid and Trae young might have a shot
Not saying Kuzma is better than Trae Young or even good but in 20-21 regular season he made more threes than Trae and had a better 3p shooting percentage
Trae Young is a top 5 point guard in the league
Which defense is better Trae Young and Lou Will or the one with 3 all defensive team guys?
Trae young would get a statue and run this city
I mean like 5% Trae. Lou Williams' fire shooting and our entire team/coach decided to achieve maximum choke. Trae Young and Lou Williams were both defending for 8 minutes in the 4th and we made about 4 points.
TIL Trae Young isn’t an all star
how bad would the fires be if Trae Young hits a game winner in game 7?
"Trae Young has been this good for 2 years, this is nothing new. he got snubbed hard."
I’m not talking about that. You said Ben Simmons is more valuable than Trae Young. Do you still hold that opinion after watching 5 games of this series?
Trae Young deserved a spot over Ben Simmons
Take off that hawks flair. I'm not even a fan and i never counted this team out. Trae young was clutch against the knicks and hes doing it again here.
Trae young 15th best player under 25.
Just imagine Trae Young isoing a hobbled James Harden with no good rim protector behind him 5 times in a row until Steve Nash calls a time out.   3 times a game.
"Trae Young isn't better quite yet (not enough accolades, too underrated) but he's got a more complete game."
Trae Young and its not even close  Giannis has some of the worst basketball iq we've seen from a superstar .
Bruh that Trae Young photoshop omg
"Thing is you are comparing him to the picks before him...aka Luka. It's because that trade was seen negatively at the time. What people forget is ATL also got a protect first round pick, which turned in to cam reddish. I always thought Trae young was the truth because I loved the fact that him and Baker Mayfield were the star players for Oklahoma. But yeah. The reason people think what you're saying is because Trae and Luka will forever be intertwined in comparisons."
might have to cop a trae young jersey
the ghost of devin kurant channelled into trae young
"Murray's a good defender, not DPOY tier but def good, but PG defense is overrated, Hawks literally just won with Lou Will and Trae Young on the court lol."
You gonna talk about HIS flopping in a game with Trae Young? That mf shot more from the line than the Sixers team did.
Fuck trae young
“no All-Defensive players”  Wow let me just say how great defenders Trae Young and Bogdan Bogdanovic are.
I’m with ya. Every series is a must watch because I don’t know what’s going to happen. Seeing trae young absolutely crush it is something I probably never would have seen.
It was weird af how nba media painted him as the bad guy after Knicks fans were chanting Fuck Trae Young two minutes into the game
Look at Trae Young
Trae Young with a chip on his shoulder is a fucking problem
Just now realizing that Trae young is literally the opposite of Ben Simmons in every way. Simmons is like Trae’s Waluigi
"As an OKC fan, I'm a full KD hater. But his greatness is undeniable. When he's on fire, all you can do is ask god for mercy. Too tall to block, too strong to body, ball handling too good to be stripped, ultra efficient at high usage, high BBIQ to kill you if you double team. He's a real life MyPlayer with all the sliders turned up. This MFer tore his achilles and is still a top 3 player in the league.  The Sixers dropping a 20+ point lead in half a quarter to Lou Williams and Trae Young is worse."
Trae Young is basically getting reffed like he's Heatles LeBron
"Jamal Murray is a far better player, IMO. First of all he shows up when it matters, and is an absolute killer in the playoffs. Generally very clutch. Varied offensive arsenal and great 2 man game with Jokic. Won't get shut down by the esteemed defensive stalwarts of Lou Will and Trae Young"
at the hands of a small PG that apparently you're not allowed to defend  Trae Young is getting LeBron level star treatment
not guarding trae young and bricking FTs
I wonder when opposing fans are going to realize it’s not in their best interest to start booing Trae Young?
this series is making me hate him even more  Trae Young is apparently getting LeBron ref treatment
Trae young isn’t a fluke
I mean Trae Young had a similar injury and Giannis looked like he was done and they both came back. Kyrie always seems to something wrong with him and they never really coincide with eachother.
It's his time for the extension and he's very forgettable as a player in the league. He didn't make any impact on anybody. Cavs were bottom feeders when they drafted him. They're still bottom feeders. Compare that to Trae Young and Hawks for example.
"Why are you acting like they got smacked every game? They only got blown out in 1 game. The rest were 10-13pt losses after fouling down the stretch.   If Trae Young catchers fire and is dropping 45 every night, without stepping on that Ref's foot, Atlanta could win.   This is why hypotheticals are stupid. There are so many factors that you really can't account for, and it just becomes a glorified 2K simulation."
Trae Young
".5 to 1 point lines are not uncommon all throughout the day. Last time Scott Foster was selected as referee, someone on twitter posted a photo of a reddit comment saying that the Foster announcement caused the line to shift a whole .5. Not only is .5 insignificant enough to even mention, but there's nothing concrete that shows the line moved because of the announcement.   If it actually moved say 1.5-2 points within a couple hours of the announcement with no other new variable that came into play, then you could suggest that Foster being announced may have played a role in how people are betting the game. Not a .5 move though.   A few weeks back, Trae Young being announced as surprisingly out decreased the line by only 2.5 points for the Hawks. Bettors genuinely believing a referee rigs a game against a specific player would cause much more movement than .5."
"You can say the same thing about the bucks being there, if the Nets were healthy or even Trae young doesn't get hurt they probably don't make it either"
It’s a proven fact that Trae Young can’t lead a team to the Finals. It’s time for the Hawks to blow it up.  /s
"As much as it pains me, Trae Young."
https://www.google.com/amp/usports.org/trae-young-unhappy-with-usa-basketball-after-olympics-snub/amp/
If the playoffs is so important then why take players who were the best players on non-playoff teams? Kind of a flawed logic. They didn’t take trae young either so idk what your point is.
All Celtics fans love Trae young after they beat the sixers lol
Where’s Ice Trae Young ❄️ on this list??
"I think superstars are the top 11-12 players in the league who could be a first option on a championship team. Lebron, KD, Steph, kawhi, Harden, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Dame, Ad, and Luka. Stars are guys just below that who are better suited as second options on a championship team like Kyrie, PG, Russ, CP3, Beal. All stars are at their best when they’re third options like Jrue, Vucevic, Conley, and Middleton. Jayson Tatum, Trae, Zion, Dbook, Lavine, Ja, and Shai are all too young imo to be rated on this scale yet. They could all end up being superstars, or all stars, or somewhere in between."
"https://www.nbadraft.net/2018-nba-draft-combine-measurements/   https://www.nbadraft.net/2019-nba-draft-combine-measurements/  Oh wow, look at all those percentages in the 4-6% range from the 2018 NBA COMBINE.  Oh, and the 2019 Combine.  Wow.  Bruce Brown 3.75  Grayson Allen 5.5  Kostas Antetok~~~ 5.0  Shai Gilchrist Alexander - 3.0  Landry Shamat 4.8  Nic Claxton 4.5  Cam Reddish 4.7  &gt;**Tako Fall 6.8**  Trae Young 5.4"
Now  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Devin Booker  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Jamal Murray  6. De’Aaron Fox  7. Ja Morant  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander     Ceiling  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Ja Morant  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Devin Booker  6. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  7. De’Aaron Fox  8. Jamal Murray
"Thats not even including Trae Young, Bam Adebayo and Brandon Ingram who were All Stars last year"
"For the point you're making though I don't see the need to exclude guys who are just 1-3 years older as they will be playing most if not all of their careers with those same &lt;25 guys anyways.  If you do include those players the point is pretty much negated.   Plus that's also without stating the obvious, that those guys are young, they can easily develop into players around that level. Guys like Zion, Trae, and Tatum have already had similarly impressive if not more impressive seasons than all of Harden's 25 &amp; younger seasons. Most players take time to develop. Imo it's far too early to say whether or not those class of guys will or won't reach that level.   I honestly see no reason why the talent should ever be in question. The sport only grows more popular and sports medicine only gets better as time goes on. Every decade will have it's own iconic set of stars."
Fair enough. It's just so much driven by media narrative. Trae Young wasn't even an All Star. Suddenly he's playing against the Knicks in the play-offs and he's a revelation. Trae went up a notch in the play-offs but didn't have a massive leap that most media said. They just never watched him in the regular season. It's maddening.
Giannis goes down you have two all-star-level talent who can step up. Trae goes down and you have a bunch of young players who wouldn't have sniffed the play-in game. Losing Donte= Losing Hunter.   Even if you consider losing two games of Giannis (which according to reports seems to be precaution rather than necessity) as equal to losing Trae then you're still left with an injured Bogdanovic.
"Remind me in 5 years. None of the u25 players currently in the NBA will have an MVP award except for Luka, maybe Trae Young and Zion."
"AD won a championship Lillard lead a team to the western conference finals. What has Luka accomplished in the NBA? For me he’s even with Trae, Tatum, Mitchell, Booker in the group of young stars"
&gt; Trae Young for half  You mean while we didn't have Giannis?  We also didn't have Donte the entire series.
"They are missing their backup center which forces them to play small when Ayton sits. You're underselling Saric while overselling Donte. Hawks also missed Trae Young for half, Hunter, and Bogdanovic was hurt."
"Trae young flopping, etc"
"At this point curry and harden were not considered anywhere near potential all time greats. In fact, if you say luka= lebron and Zion=KD, between Trae,Morant,SGA, and Tatum, it’s very easy to say we have more young players who project all time than the time period you mentioned.(obviously just like harden and Curry, progress is never really linear)."
"Wow!! So much for the "" all NBA teams needs some kind of luck to get to the finals talking point"". Bucks swept an underachieving Heat team. Then went on to beat the DEPLETED Nets. Then a stupid fucking ref stands behind Trae Young as he's shooting and basically takes him out and the Hawks are done..but yet anyone ever talks about is the road the Suns took to get there!! RIDICULOUS! Fuck the r/nba and r/espn !! Can we please get the Finals on TNT!!"
"Hey, I’m defending the Bucks against the same bs argument. Nets being injured, Trae Young being injured, etc. Both teams deserve to be here and no one can take that away."
"Hawks, the Booker hate already shows what will happen if Trae Young makes it to the Finals. Plus Trae kind of took on that villain role in NY"
"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"
But just look at the list that aren't all stars but still young stars  Ja MPJ Fox Murray SGA Ingram Bam Trae Lamelo Edwards Ayton JJJ Sexton KAT Dlo   Also we're about to get up to 5 potential superstars in just this draft alone and thats just the top guys without any breakout candidates
"Giannis Antetokoumpo- Winner, dominant force of nature, reminds me of David Robinson and Shaq with his ability to absolutely affect the game just with his physicality. Is on a winning team.  Luka Doncic- Young Phenom, is skilled, shifty handles and ball fakes, can make circus shots or no look passes. Clutch, and is on a up and coming team that is looking for the next price to elevate them.  Trae Young- absolutely electric player, logo threes, ankle breakers, or lobs to his big men, shifty handles and crisp passing. Is on a young team that overachieved a little bit, but should be able to continue their level of play, and will only get better.   Zion Williamson- Air Gumbo, looks like shaq bud is 6’6, can body anybody out of the way, is a insane dunker. On a bad team right now, but one that has a lot of talent, and are trying to figure it out to make the playoffs."
does trae young deserve it tho? your comment came across as pretttty salty
Trae Young!   /s
"Derrick ""better than Trae Young"" White"
"* Luka Doncic * Devin Booker * SGA * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Trae Young * Ja Morant * De'Aaron Fox  Anyone who doesn't put Luka #1 is on crack. SGA's length makes me love him for the defensive aspect of his game more than a few others, even if they're a bit better scorers. It's crazy how Fox is last cuz I think he's also great."
I think you mean trae young not devin booker
"He’s one of the most interesting dominant big men of all time, if not the most interesting.   I don’t think any other players are gonna be saying he’s “just running and dunking” like Harden said about Giannis, nor is he “flailing” or “acting” like Harden or Trae Young, nor is he “chucking” like Steph or Trae. He’s not standing right next to the basket and bulldozing people like Shaq. He’s not taller than his defender and shooting over them like KAJ. He’s not just ISOing and fading away.   He’s doing a little of all of that, altogether, and running the sets in a way the defense can’t predict. He’s deeply interesting."
what about dunking on trae young
"you have to create new superstars though, and the only way is through the playoffs. Steph and Lebron are all time greats, but they are old and won't be playing (at least on that level) for long. you need new superstars to ascend, and that's what we are watching now.   After this year's playoffs i really want to see what happens next year on the Giannis vs KD rematch and the battles we'll get from them. Also want to see Booker repeating what he did this year's playoffs having more deep playoff runs. Meanwhile, Trae Young, Embiid, Luka, Jokic... way too many stars that await their chance to take their game to the next level.  Maybe im biased, but for me the best league was at 2008-2010, with Celtics and Lakers, where lots of teams were strong, no team was superteam, game was supercompetitive and talent was distributed (Suns - Spurs - Denver - Utah - Orlando - Cleveland)"
But I was told that many other young talent was passed up because they “didn’t earn it yet” ? How can KJ be on the team but Trae Young not? Is there any justification for that?
Atlanta was insane when we won too. I'll never forget screaming my lungs out as Trae Young rode by in the parade :)...  ...in the dream I had the other day before Khris Middleton slept with my wife and clogged the toilet before bouncing.
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
Trae Young
"Trae averaged more assists last season as well when the Mavericks had a historically great offense and the hawks had 20 wins. Trae young also averaged 17.6 potential assists per game this season, which is actually higher than Lukas average of 16.3. So your excuse isn’t actually real"
"Overall, offense is a far more valuable attribute for a player to have than defense.  It is not a 1:1 ratio.  Typically, just being competent on defense satisfactory, as match-ups and schemes are more important than individual prowess.  One way defensive players typically don't fare well in the NBA.  They are out there, Tony Allen and Andre Roberson come to mind, but they aren't stars and are best used in match-up specific scenarios.  Hiding a players shortcomings on offense can often be downright impossible and the whole team comes to a crawl.  Hiding somebody like Trae Young and Bradley Beal on defense is not only feasible but they can still be your stars on the team.  There's no amount of amazing defense from an individual player that could ever match Trae offensive production.  Defense is also reactionary, you can make it as hard as possible for your opponent to score but it's always up to them to play better.  Of course being able to play excellent individual or help defense is still very valuable, which is why two way players are sought-after.  Draymond certainly is/was a two way player.  So is Klay.  As a whole, advance metrics do favor Draymond It's true.  Until you take Steph or KD off the court.  Then Klay handedly takes over.  Though in general when Steph goes to the bench, even with KD, everyone drops off pretty heavily.  At least in the regular season,  nobody can deny KD being mvp in the finals but overall steph,  the worst defender, is the most important player on that team."
"Pretty crazy how many young players are elite passers in the league now.   Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball, Ben Simmons, Ja Morant, etc.   Seems like we have been getting a steady influx of players beyond their years for passing/playmaking"
But that doesn't even mean anything. The only thing this sub is consistent at is insisting that every move is either genius or completely idiotic with no middle ground. And of course when you look back the sub either looks like a genius or an idiot.  Like drafting Trae Young (even without the trade) was seen as a 'obvious at the time shitty move.'
"Trae Young, is that you?"
"How does New Orleans draft a generational superstar and fail to make any moves to get them immediate help.  Atlanta made it look easy with Trae Young. Despite Dallas' shortcomings they did try quite hard to put decent rosters for Luka and his rosters have been good.   New Orleans is just a garbage organization, I'm sorry. Also they did JJ Redick dirty."
The best team I could come up with:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo
"People were saying that during and shortly after the Nets series, when he was doing a really poor job. Since then, he’s been marvelous at making adjustments, from moving Lopez high in the PnR defense vs Trae Young, to putting Jrue on CP3, to emphasizing Giannis as the roll man and pushing the Giannis-Middleton PnR more…  He’s been really, really good in the last two series"
Trae Young is already better than peak Reggie tbh
"Injured nets team, durant toe on the line, injured trae young, injured saric so if ayton gets two fouls early its done, etc.   With all the injuries, no matter who wins there's plenty of asterisking to be done by haters."
he did the trae young alley oop pass hahaha
"I'm not saying it was 1:1 or anything, but I was getting strong Reggie Miller vibes from Trae Young for how he approached the postseason this year.   There was such a world-beating, welcome to the show type of vibe to each of those guys, where they'd willingly head into enemy territory with the goal of staring down 20,000 people who hate you and just reveling in it as you drop bomb after bomb. And at some point, it almost crosses over into incitement, but both commanded the stage so well under those circumstances that it just worked."
"Trying to avoid the young guys like Jaylen Brown or Trae Young who will almost certainly get another AS nod.  C: Kristaps Porziņģis  PF: Meta World Peace  SF: Josh Howard  SG: Jrue Holiday  PG: Goran Dragic  &amp;#x200B;  Great defensive team. Okay spacing, MWP and Howard could both hit 3s and Holiday and Dragic are decent 3PT guys, All Star Porziņģis was a 40% 3PT shooter and averaged 23 ppg Dragic has shown he can be a 21 ppg guy, let him go off. Everyone on this team can shoot the 3, you have two ball handlers, a great rim protector in Porziņģis and elite defenders in MWP and Holiday. If healthy (big if with Josh Howard, and Porziņģis) this team would win 60+ games IMO."
"2011 Mavs beat Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Dwade, and bosh. Giannis beat a nets team without Kyrie, a crippled harden, trae young, and Chris Paul/Devin Booker they can’t be compared"
Defense and all out effort. Exactly what the National team needed to focus on and Keldon definitely provides! No shade to Trae Young but the analysts and fans hating on KJ need to realize they aren’t drafting a Fantasy Basketball team.
Trae young  Jaylen brown   Iggy  Zion  Bam adebayo  Maybe goes against the spirit of your question since all of these guys will probably end with multiple All-stars. But right now it's probably the most talented lineup
He plays like if Draymond Green thought he was Trae Young
Does that show even more just how ridiculous Trae Young really is?
"It’s not a personal thing with steph, it’s a stylistic thing. Dude has such a specific skill set and him combined with Klay and the system the Warriors run changed basketball at every level, especially at the point. Now everyone is basically trying to get their point to play like steph (high volume 3’s, not as much emphasis on passing/playmaking, less insistence on limiting turnovers) and it’s basically running the more traditional points out of a place in the game, because with the rules the way they are, guys who can do all that and draw fouls consistently (Trae Young is the biggest offender) are just damn near unstoppable. Sure, guys like CP3 still exist, but it seems like every year fewer and fewer guards come up with real playmaking ability because they’ve all been told to do nothing but practice jumpers and drawing contact."
Same way I feel about Trae Young haha.
"I think it's good, harmless fun. It's a family-friendly way to not only give a player some shit, but give the NBA some shit for having rules they don't enforce. It's way more harmless fun than the crowd telling Trae Young he's balding at an early age or whatever."
"Wiggins for most of his career has been an ineffficient one dimensional scorer who gives you nothing else of value. Last year with Golden State was his best year in terms of versatility, where he showed a 3pt shot and improved defensive Metrics. Still nowhere near Siakam, who was All-NBA 2nd team and peaked at .175 win shares/48. Wiggins has never crossed triple digits. Even in Siakam’s down year, he’s still a better playmaker, defender, rebounder, and scorer than Wiggins, who’s only advantage over Siakam right now is a better 3pt shot.  As for your point, yeah getting a 10% upgrade on Wiggins isn’t worth shipping him out with Wiseman and the 7th pick. But Siakam is more than 10% better than Wiggins, so I disagree on that trade not being worth it.  Premise is okay, but if the example doesn’t make sense how can I agree? If I say we want decent young players for Lowry in a sign and trade, and then say Trae Young, would you agree with my point?"
Fuck Trae Young
"The fact that it should have been a flagrant on CP3, and also Booker got away with 3 last game, and 1 obvious one this game. Why would the NBA want to promote giannis over CP3, Dbook, Trae Young, KD, Kyrie,  Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo?"
these playoffs in particular has been an intriguing unveiling of newer stars such as Trae Young (and Hawks teammates) and Luka Doncic and Nuggets guy and it's also seen some chokers and exposed some weaknesses in players / teams
"Seriously, CP3 is the KING of flopping bullshit fouls. Or at least one of the progenitors, perhaps tied for kingship with Harden and Trae Young and Luka.   He absolutely is infuriating to watch and flops constantly."
"The Sixers wouldn't beat us anyways. Their number 2 guy is afraid of dunking on 6'1 Trae Young, you think that would give us problems?"
"The Bucks got to sweep the Miami Bubble Boys, go against the Nets without Harden, then hurt Kyrie, and barely made it out of the series, dodged the Sixers in the Hawks upset, went down against the Hawks but made a recovery after a referee injured Trae Young, and now are against the Suns who lost their backup center due to a torn ACL and Chris Paul is playing with a hurt hand.  If anything, the stars aligned perfectly for the Bucks to most likely win the Finals"
"I’ve been a CP3 fan since his hornets days, so I’m a bit bias. I feel like Curry is in the weird spot like Jerry West in which people tend to leave out Jerry West in the SG ranking calling him a point guard, while he played more like a SG which leaves him totally out of both PG and SG. All time, it goes Magic, Oscar, Jerry West, and then it’s IT/Curry/CP3 imo. I’m very high on Luka because he seems more of a generational talent like LeBron, in which they can score and create for other people, one player who is similar would be Trae, so I’m not really sure where he lands. At this moment, I would imagine Kyrie and Lillard would be in top 10. I’m looking forward to the next 4-7 years to see what can Luka and Trae do. There’s also Ja Morant, but I hope he changes his playstyle, he looks too much like Oladipo, Rose, Wade, Westbrook… every time he goes to the rim and he lands, I cringe a little bit. He’s an exciting young talent, I’m sure he will figure it out."
"He literally called KD the best player in the world and complimented Trae Young in the ECF. Every series, every game of his career he’s complimenting the stars of whatever team he’s facing."
Breathing on Giannis is a foul tho. Pretty soon if you look to hard at Trae Young or Luka it's going to be
Lol fucking trae young got injured and Hunter was out the entire series.
Also no Trae Young to block Giannis
"My team literally embarrassed yours 2 years ago, then you got embarrassed again by Miami, and then got a miracle with the nets injuries and Durants big toe bailing out your dogshit coach before beating up an injured trae young.   By all means, I hope to God the bucks keep bud, so I can enjoy your fanbase calling for his head again for the 4th time in 5 years when he inevitably collapses against the healthy nets."
Don't underestimate the Hawks and Trae young like the eventual Champ Milwaukee Bucks did game 1.
That's the trae young cp3 special.
Bucks path to their mickey mouse ring pop:  Heat with a 60 day offseason + Oladipo out  Nets missing Kyrie/Harden/Jeff Green. Stadium at 50% capacity  Hawks missing Trae Young and Deandre Hunter  Suns third best team in the west + CP3 playing through injury  10 all stars missed at least 1 game this postseason. New NBA record. Previous record was 6. Most unique starting lineups in a single postseason in NBA history  Win a real finals

If Bucks win they should all write a thank you note to Kyrie for getting injured and the ref that took out Trae Young
"I don't think anyone's denying this is a flop. To go through Jimmy Butler, James Harden, Trae Young - all to pull this off in Chris Paul's face and get the call? Legendary."
"Right, but Trae Young atleast does it mostly in the halfcourt after pnrs. To do it in transition where defenders are running back full speed is a different level of danger for both teams, and the Suns do it more than any team we’ve faced (we’ve faced the Hawks)."
How can you not root for the team that swept Jimmy Butler in round 1 and got rid of Trae Young???? They are America’s team ☺️☺️☺️☺️
That's what we call the Trae Young
He didn't jump backwards. He STOPPED. That is legal.  That change is the Trae Young jump back with a defender behind you which he would do to get a shooting foul.
"I assume you're talking about NYC. As a New Yorker, we will talk mad shit. It's in our genes. See Knicks fans vs Trae Young."
Trae Young is the biggest flopper.  My saltiness has oozed into this non-hawks thread.
"i hate that crap that cam payne just did. and i hate that trae young, my favorite player in the league, does it as well. nba needs to get rid of that crap. it’s dangerous and doesn’t have a place in the league. it’s also stupid to penalize the defender for just running with him in transition."
The trae young special
"Payne pulling the Trae Young foul bait game, haha."
that's the trae young special
and Bucks outlasted an injured Nets team and a hurt Trae Young. Both teams have had great injury luck this postseason.
You’re right. I meant Trae Young. Either way I don’t think listing injured players on opposing squads devalues anyone’s accomplishments.
"Something something, Trae Young"
"When did i say that? I said the Hawks had only 1 real superstar, Trae Young, and yall lost. With a full healthy team. The dymbass 76ers org babied Ben Simmons. He has so much raw talent but since your owners is dumb as shit they let him goof off during the off-season and he never got any better. Just the fact that yall hired Doc shows how incompetent that organization is. Keep jerking off to shoes my friend ✌."
"Sure, my point is more that people are talking about Jrue's defensive upgrade as if Bledsoe defended like Trae Young. At the end of the day, if you have an 80th percentile PG defender like Bledsoe surrounded by other good defenders, a 95th percentile PG defended is not your biggest need."
"RJ Barrett will be considered a top 15 player in the league  Knicks will make it to the ECF once in this timespan   Celtics blow up their core and rebuild  Kevin Durant leaves the Nets (without winning a ring) when he’s a FA and goes back to OKC, and leads them to a ring  Luka Doncic is the best player in the league (but on a different team)  Like you said, Kawhi retires early  Cade Cunningham is first team All NBA in 2026, leads the pistons to the ECF, but is not the best player in his draft  Jalen Green wins an MVP in 2026 and leads the Rockets to the finals  Kings finally make the playoffs  Lebron retires in 2025, after playing with Bronny. Wins a ring with Bronny.   Trae Young leaves the Hawks to help form a super team out west, with Nikola Jokic  Suns and CP3 win back to back rings this year and next year   Devin Booker wins 1 MVP  Giannis wins another MVP and a ring in 2023  Seattle and Las Vegas get expansion teams, bringing the NBA to 32 teams  James Wiseman is traded next summer and thrives with his new team"
Zach LaVine and Mikal Bridges join Anthony Davis on the Lakers to form a superteam  At least one team gets relocated  Trae Young wins MVP  Kings don't make the playoffs and hit a 20 year streak  Klay Thompson retires  LaMelo becomes a top 3 PG   Embiid wins an MVP  The NBA expands by two teams  The Nets don't win a championship  *Champions:*  2021- Bucks  2022- Nuggets  2023- 76ers  2024- Lakers  2025- Lakers
"Look. What is Simmons on defense? An amazing perimeter defender, Warriors have Wiggins for that job not Green. Trading Green for Simmons means Simmons ain’t getting those Trae Young matchups. He’ll get matched up against Jokic, AD, Embiid, Zion and Giannis down in the post and paint pretty much all game, and fighting for rebounds with those dude’s as well. I think offensively you can kind of replace Dray with Simmons, maybe even improve. In the locker room you can’t, and making Simmons a full-time 4-5, making him shoot, guarding bigs with only a couple months of not only learning the scheme but then having to anchor it?  You’d be wagering your locker room leader and defensive anchor, also probably a young depth piece and a pick. That’s not a win-now move and it doesn’t seem like the best win-later move either."
[Trae Young](https://imgur.com/gallery/Woftbw0)
I need someone to do Trae Young as a child
Trae young is already young   Tacko fall would be a season  Blake Griffin would be fucking insane to see
Trae Young
"&gt;That's the one thing I'll never understand with Simmons,   &gt;Instead he refused to shoot them at all, weird.  This is precisely the one thing that seals the deal for me on the Ben Simmons ""case"". Folks here think the defining moment was him passing out of the dunk against Trae Young, but it wasn't.   Nothing else writes the script on Simmons' personality quite as much as the way he had to be coddled and begged MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGH THE MEDIA by his head coach to make a basic adjustment to his game. And instead of acknowledging it he ignored it and waited for Brown to be fired due to the team underperforming from a lack of spacing and Simmons not showing development."
"With pace and individual scoring increasing, wouldn’t be surprised if someone breaks it in the next few years. Luka might as he improves just because the Mavs lack other major scoring threats and don’t have a way to get one for the foreseeable future, but also a player like Trae Young or someone else might in the near future."
Check any Trae Young thread from before this year’s playoffs
Trae Young is not better than Damian Lillard
"It's a bit weird to see guys like Morant, Tatum, Trae, Luka, and the rest of the young squad starting to take over the NBA.   So this is what it's like to be part of the older generation. I used to see majority of the players as older than me guys. Damn."
What position is Trae Young playing when he guards the guy who stands in the corner?
"There’s a pretty gap between Trae Young and Russ in terms of passing ability. This isn’t even a slight on Trae Young, he’s an excellent passer in his own right, I just think it’s being overlooked that Russ had an all time great season passing the ball. He had a top 20 season of ALL TIME in assists per game on a list dominated by Magic and Stockton. To put that into more digestible terms, it is the historical equivalent of putting up 33.5 ppg, which would put you 19th all time in ppg for a season, which is the same placement Russ has on the assist per game leaderboard."
Caruso and Trae Young !
"AI didn't need people to pass to. He played that way because of the era he was in. I think if he was of college age today, he would play much more like Trae Young...obviously way better though. A lot of Trae youngs efffectiveness comes from the threat of his 3 point shot.  AI rarely took threes, especially dep threes.  If he played today, he would have dame like range, and if the defense had to be in his race 3 feet outside of the 3 point line, his 9enetration would be so much more effective than it was.  If AI played today, he would be as good as steph curry.  Steph would be a better shooter and passer. AI would be a better penetrator, and defender...but they'd be comparable. (Right now, no one compares to steph)"
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
If the ball adjusted but the rim didn't then Trae Young would shoot 70%.
I think it's time for Trae Young to join
I think it's time for Trae Young to join them
I don’t know why people keep forgetting the hawks were one of the most injured teams in the regular season and trae got injured against the bucks. They beat the sixers without deandre hunter and cam reddish and bogdanovic was playing poorly through a knee injury. Plus we’re a young team so I would expect hunter okongwu and some other players to make significant jumps.
Who on the Hawks is scaring you Ben  Is it Trae Young? Is it Gallinari?
"Vince being teammates with Kevin Willis (born 1963) and Charles Oakley (born 1964) in his rookie year, then Trae Young and Cam Reddish in his final year (Reddish was born after Vince's rookie year) is pretty amazing."
Trae Young
" my god i still can't believe how awful that play was. my guy was so afraid of shooting FTs he gave up a dunk on 5'11"" Trae Young"
"Look, people *want to believe* you can make a man drop by first pretending to move one direction and then actually moving another.   It is part of the human condition. It is part of why NBA and any other sports league exists - to play fast and loose with the superstitious, idol-worshipping, and ego-maniac side of the public hivemind. It is about harvesting and reining in the smart apes' primitive aggression so they stare at a screen instead of burning things down..   When children stare open-mouthed at the TV where cartoon characters shoot colored beams from their hands, there is a little voice in their heads saying: *""If you are good enough, you can do transcendent, otherworldly feats"".* You can become *more than human*.   What happens when the channel is changed to ESPN?   ""This athlete can dunk after jumping from the free throw line and over a car."" (reality: he jumps over the hood, had a running start spanning the entire court which the commercial conveniently cut out, and had 7 failed attempts before).   ""This athlete can break his opponent's ankles with his crossover."" (reality: his opponent loses his balance more due to exhaustion, accidentally tripping over himself and floor condition than due to being manipulated).  It is like wanting to believe Superman and five point palm exploding heart technique exists. We already got Dwight Howard wearing a cape. Next up should be Trae Young exploding people's hearts after dunking on them 3 times."

Trae Young is my sleeper pick for MVP they’ll finish top 3 in the East
"There's just a big difference between a 19-20 year old, with likely no nba experience, and a 22 year old I think. It's not impossible to win it young, like Kawhi in 2014. Altana did good work to field a roster around Trae, but they didn't have it right when he came into the league.  So to be THAT young and have the potential to already be the best player on a championship team seems unreal. You'd need to be a once in a generation phenome like Kareem or lebron. And with how the draft works, bets are they aren't ending up on a team that could actually have a championship supporting roster right away. I'd say it's more likely we get a 19 year old MVP before a FMVP, if either could even happen."
I think it’s possible kinda. Let’s say like this year injuries were huge in the playoffs. And no disrespect to the hawks but they’re a young team and you could argue what if they made the finals and a young trae young beat an injured suns team hypothetically. Obviously right now he’s 22 but it’s just an example of how possible it is where a young player could lead a well rounded team if they reach the finals barring circumstances
PG: Trae Young  SG: James Harden  SF: PJ Tucker  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Christian Wood  EDIT:Current NBA only
Well Trae young is in his third year in the league so using career shooting splits is meaningless in this conversation. His shooting isn’t elite yet but I wouldn’t say it is below average based on the number of attempts he shoots and the variety of threes he takes it isn’t just catch and shoots. His passing and size are nash like plus his crafty finishing at the rim for a little guy. I’m not saying Nash is the perfect comparison but it’s far better than AI.
"Nobody is going to beat Steph’s record from being more efficient, or at least it’s extremely unlikely. As mentioned his later career start and slower start due to injuries makes it possible by sheer volume and luck in health by a great offensive player.  For example, Steph’s rookie year was when he was 21. Right now I think the only two players you can look at with a chance are Luka and Trae, and if not them it will likely take someone who comes in young and is good enough out of the gate to have that kind of green light early.  Steph at 21: 166 3PM  Steph after 3 seasons, age 23: 372 3PM  Trae at 21: 361 3PM  Trae after 3 seasons, age 22: 497 3PM  Luka after 3 seasons, age 21: 531 3PM"
Vince Carter played in four different decades; from 1998-2020. He was a teammate of Del Curry and Trae Young.
&gt;Another one that probably won’t be broken for years is Devin Booker’s record for most total points in a players first playoff appearance with 601.  Trae Young would likely have set the record this season if the Hawks had made the finals. That record does not seem at all unreachable.
I nominate Trae Young for next poll
Julius Randle was picked ahead of Nik Stauskas and Noah Vonleh not Luka Doncic and Trae Young
I mean it's also something fans are aware of. Trae Young doesn't get paid for his defense. He's just the only guy that's said it
Personally don't hate Harden but he can be frustrating to watch. He is one of the most talented offensive players ever and can actually be a good defender but people get annoyed when he lacks effort on that side and obviously the foul bating. Funny thing is this bothers me about most ball dominant players and it seems Harden gets more flack then he deserves. I had a roommate whose never watched basketball before and decided he hated curry because the particular game we watched  he was getting some calls and was doing that thing Trae young gets shit for where he'd stop and scoot backward into the trailing defender
Trae young is a top 5 point guard
"Trae Young is not only better than Luka, but will easily have a better career and accomplishments."
Trae Young is not the new Curry
"Look, people *want to believe* you can make a man drop by first pretending to move one direction and then actually moving another.   It is part of the human condition. It is part of why NBA and any other sports league exists - to play fast and loose with the superstitious, idol-worshipping, and ego-maniac side of the public hivemind. It is about harvesting and reining in the smart apes' primitive aggression so they stare at a screen instead of burning things down.  When children stare open-mouthed at the TV where cartoon characters shoot colored beams from their hands, there is a little voice in their heads saying: *""If you are good enough, you can do transcendent, otherworldly feats"".* You can become *more than human*.   What happens when the channel is changed to ESPN?   ""This athlete can dunk after jumping from the free throw line and over a car."" (reality: he jumps over the hood, had a running start spanning the entire court which the commercial conveniently cut out, and had 7 failed attempts before).   ""This athlete can break his opponent's ankles with his crossover."" (reality: his opponent loses his balance more due to exhaustion, accidentally tripping over himself and floor condition than due to being manipulated).  It is like wanting to believe Superman and five point palm exploding heart technique exists. We already got Dwight Howard wearing a cape. Next up should be Trae Young exploding people's hearts after dunking on them 3 times."
Trae Young is overrated. Hawks will never win a championship with him as the first option
"I just think all those guys make others around them better in a way that Dame never has. I also think they are all better playoff performers overall for their careers which might sound like a hot take considering PG13 and Jimmy have had a bad series each in the past year but they are overall great performers in the playoffs meanwhile Dame only has 3 great series to his name (2 buzzer beaters and 1 50 point game doesnt make him a good overall playoff player).  The defense is also horrible compared to all the others here not named Trae Young however, Trae's playmaking ability and ability to elevate his teammates is enough to make up the difference. I think this year's playoff run for Trae is better than anything Dame has achieved in his career."
Can Trae Young easily jump pass out of a hounding double team?
Deaaron Fox Trae Young Paul George
Trae Young   James Dolan  Bill Cohen  Woody Johnson  Hal Steinbrenner
"Ppl just conveniently ignore how bad Kyrie was when he actually had to be the first option.  Butler, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young should all be ranked higher than him rn imo"
PG Trae Young  SG: James Harden  SF: Julius Erving  PF: Karl Malone  C: Patrick Ewing
i'm glad the Hawks are getting more games this year. Trae Young was on a mission this past playoff run
"I think you actually hit the nail on the head.  If you look at the games it's about storylines.  Trae back in NY where he happily owned the villain role.  Bucks Celtics:  Possible Playoff foreshadowing.  Same with the suns, GS except for the west.  Lakers, Nets:  Two super teams going head to head.  Finish the night off with the Jazz, Mavericks and you get a clinic by two young stars with Donavan and Luca."
"Yeah I think he's an average defender overall, not a liability like a Trae Young type  I'm just saying that if you are getting locked down by him that's not a great look for you lol"
"In the age of social media, where a ton of people don’t even rely on major media outlets to keep up with the NBA and watch highlights and learn about players, your argument is absolutely absurd.  Fans aren’t saying, “Who’s this Jokic guy? The NBA never markets him, so I’ve never heard of him!” They’re saying, “Jokic? That big, goofy-looking guy? Yeah, he’s pretty good, but let’s see some Trae Young or Steph Curry or LeBron James, please.”  As others have pointed out, the Nuggets have played on Christmas the past couple years. The NBA has tried giving the fans Jokic, and evidently, not enough fans have been interested in him to warrant another Christmas game."
"I'm going to copy my own comment from the Raptors subreddit  &gt; Why are people surprised, shocked or disappointed? If we get past the Raptors in Canada stuff, we're a young team, we just lost our all Star point guard, and for Pascal, did they mention if you would recover in time to make a run for the all-stars?   &gt; And for any one thinking about Scottie, Atlanta had 2 National games too the year they drafted Trae Young and Trae was way more hyped than Scottie.  &gt; This is all part of the grind ma dudes 💪💪"
"How tf is Booker on here ahead of Jimmy, PG and Trae Young? He is barely a top 5 SG"
"&gt;Like, if D Rose talked shit people would just think it's funny and move on for the most part. PG does it and everybody wants to throw it back in his face.  if D Rose let Trae Young hit a series ending game winner in his face and said it was a ""bad shot"" I assure you he would get the pandemic p treatment"
"LaMelo and Ant are not young stars, yet. Trae, Luka, Zion are young stars. And they're getting enough marketing relative to other stars in the league."
"I feel like you guys need an exciting top 3 pick to help draw some more attention, the way LaMelo did for CHA, Trae did for ATL, Towns did for MIN, and hopefully Cade will do for us. When's the last time the Pacers had a young star right out of the draft? Rik Smits in '88?"
"When Curry became good  Watch Atlanta become a FA spot with Trae Young. It’s 100% gonna happen, book it"
Trae Young is an ice cold killer.
"Dude you could, idk, praise Trae instead of turning the other way and shitting on the Bucks. Just a thought, that maybe on a Trae Young highlight vid, you should be appreciating Trae Young rather than insulting his competition."
"Nah, no defense, turnover prone, lost two big games to not even make the playoffs.  How is that really even better than what Bradley Beal or Trae Young or Lillard did the year before?  Lots of points, no results.  I've got him at like 6 or 7th.  If I'm starting a squad, that's where he'd go."
"Because going to the WCF already exceeded expectations.  We don't criticize Trae Young for losing to the Bucks. AT the end o' the day, the better team won, and even if they pull off 2 of those, they weren't winning the series.  Allen Iverson gets no flak for losing in the finals, because he went farther than he was supposed to."
Trae Young
"Giannis seems to be the most obvious choice. His reputation improve a lot after winning the title (I know this is a regular season award, but that still matters), he's the only superstar of his team, that probabily will have one of the best records in the NBA.  Other contenders:  Jokic is also a good shout, Nuggets probabily will have a good record even if Jamal misses most part of the season  KD: Best player in the league imo, but he might still load manage a lot this season, and he also plays with another superstar. But I think that if he have some crazy stats like last season he might still have a shot.  Lebron: He's already old and has been coasting in the regular season for years... Westbrook on his team will also make his usage rate a lot lower.   Curry and Doncic probabily won't have a record good enough to win MVP.   Embiid: I don't know if he's healthy enough to win an MVP. The 76ers probabily won't be the first seed again.  I think Trae is a good dark horse. He basically have the perfect roster to win MVP. A team filled with great role players, but don't have another superstar with him, so he can be ball dominant. He can have crazy stats and a great record at the same time. If their young players keep improving and he have a similar statline to his sophomore season with slightly better efficiency he may be the MVP."
"&gt; ja has had the better career thus far, mainly because of his play in and playoff performances  Widely viewed winning plays in those PLAYOFF games. Deaaron Fox's biggest stage was for Team USA and he 'withdrew to concentrate on the season' only for his team to suck again.   Trae Young was getting dogged last year for playing to selfishly, and this year everyone saw how he could elevate those around him. Perceptions can change fast even for stars. Fox just has to get onto the bigger stage."
Yeah definitely 1. Steph Curry 2. Chris Paul 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damien Lillard 6. Mike Conley 7. Jrue Holiday 8. Trae Young  9. Malcom Brogdon 10.De’aaron Fox
"Ok so here's my breakdown: 1A) Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Giannis. Their job is to carry teams, even if they're shitty.  1B) Dame, AD, Kyrie, Harden, Embiid, Luka, Tatum, CP3 1C) Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Brad Beal, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young"
Watching the ECF against the Hawks this year I couldn't believe how many floaters Trae Young was hitting over 7ft guys with consistency.  Super boring to watch but insane touch and talent to do it.
"yeah when he cant shoot and even afraid to dunk because of Trae fucking Young around him, he is a liability"
A lot depends on trae young.
"The East has never been weak at the PG position, what kind of bullshit is this?  Kyle Lowry  Kemba Walker  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Isaiah Thomas  Trae Young  Ben Simmons  These guys have all been All NBA caliber PGs at some point in recent memory despite playing in the east."
"Better fit how? Ben can’t shoot outside of 3 feet (can’t even dunk over Trae Young for that matter). The Raptors have plenty of defensive minded players, what they need is offense and Ben doesn’t provide that."
"Ingram is better that’s not controversial and hasn’t been for the past two seasons imo. Ben Simmons plays in the East which was weak at PG so him and Kyle Lowry made a ton of all star teams. They would’ve never sniffed multiple all star teams in the west. Ingram has improved his game every season and only weakness is his defense which can improve as he adds more muscle but he has the length and agility. Ben Simmons issues are mental and mechanical. Im not sure how a grown man 25+ already in the league with a ton of money fixes that. Or if he even wants to. His situation is a fucking mess honestly. His production is very deceiving because he gets most of his numbers in first half transition opportunities you can literally see him hunting his 7-8 rebounds/assists to have that bs “all around” argument when he disappears in half court offensive sets where he’s useless or gets benched. If the Sixers had Ingram no way they lose to ATL. They just needed Ben to score like 16 per game and instead he gave them like 9 with a million missed free throws. His defense wasn’t all that great either so throw that argument out. He couldn’t guard Trae Young, Huerter, Collins, etc. he was just running around out there."
Trae Young - nutmeg  Dwight Howard - shoulders
Trae young
"I know he’s a Warriors fan, but Ain’t no way he really believes Draymond is better than Tatum and Trae Young 🤣🤣🤣"
Current Tatum and Current Trae Young are not close to the worst player you would be happy with as a 1st pick.
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
Trae Young is better than Tatum as well. I don't think Tatum has a shot at MVP.
Trae young.
Well I guess this year it's Trae Young.
"Lou williams and Trae young were exploited when they were on the court against the Sixers starters. The problem was, OP is misremembering and Lou was cooking against the bench. He cooled off once the starters came back but the damage was done."
Fox is better than Trae Young. Fight me
Swap Ben for any guard that can attack and exploit Trae Young or Lou Will in a pick and roll and they win that series. I'm not even talking a Dame or CP3 I'm talking De'Aaron Fox and they win
Trae Young was shooting 39% from the field and 32% from 3 in that series.
"I would argue yes.  If you look at the top players in the game today, it’s clear that this is the era with the biggest variety in terms of style of play.    Today you have sharpshooting guards with elite playmaking in Curry, Dame, Harden, CP3, Trae Young etc.    But you also have big, physical wings who like to slash in Giannis and Lebron.  You have 3-level scorers who are elite from midrange in KD, Luka, and Kawhi.   You’ve got Jokic who is an elite low post scorer who can extend to the 3 and is an elite playmaker.    You’ve got Embiid who can shoot threes, but makes his money being absolutely game changing beneath the rim.    You’ve got Rudy Gobert who has never made a 3 in his career, but changes the game defensively.    And that’s not even touching on the next generation of players coming up all of whom are bringing new skill sets into the game.    This variety exists because the 3 pointer is so important today.  Why?  Because it’s so easy to get 3pt shooters in today’s game.  In the 2000’s, the game was entirely predicated on iso scoring wings and dominant low post players.  But that meant if you wanted to be a star, you had to be either an iso scoring wing (Kobe, TMac, DWade, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, hell even Lebron played as an iso scoring guard when he first came into the league) or a dominant low post player (Shaq, Yao Ming, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard).  If you had any other skill set, you were a role player.  Are you an elite wing defender and playmaker?  Role player.  Are you a hyper efficient 3pt shooter?  Role player.  Are you a stretch big who can rebound, pass, handle the ball, and guard on the perimeter?  Well can you go against Shaq one-on-one 2ft from the basket?  No?  Role player.    Nowadays, if you come into the NBA with staf potential, regardless of skill set teams can build around you because the only requirement that a team needs to have offensive is good shooting, and you can get that from role players, you don’t need that from your stars.  So now stars can be whatever they are best at, and teams will fill in the rest of the team with 3&amp;D role players and be all set."
Sixers because a team that’s supposed to be amazing defensively got fucking cooked by Trae young
Trae Young
"Well I think you can’t get too greedy and “guarantee”. I think practically speaking guarantee means 98% chance that player, without getting hurt, can carry the team to the final 4. I don’t think you can get worse. You need to have a guy that is close to unguardable by college dudes, and the fact that Zion couldn’t do it on a duke team shows it’s not as easy as it sounds.   If you reduce it to like 90% likely I want to say guys like Donovan Mitchell, trae young, gobert. But idk if it’s a guarantee."
"nah man, Murray isn’t even efficient as the secondary player. why would he get more efficient as lead ball handler? something he hasn’t done since he played for Canada?    Look at their non-bubble stats and it’s kinda clear:  2019-20 tracking stats:          Catch and Shoot.      Pull-up     Murray     39% 2.33PA     32% 3.03PA     Sexton     42% 2.23PA     35% 1.73PA  Sexton is the better shooter already, Murray getting worse looks and more attention isn’t going to increase his efficiency at all  yeah Murray might go up to 24 a game (something Brandon Ingram didn’t even do) but i find it hard to believe anybody thinks Murray could do that while increasing how often he makes shots. he would easily be the worst 24 point scorer in the league.   for reference: Kawhi Leonard averaged 24.8,Trae Young averaged 25.3, and Sexton 24.3. you’re asking for a huge leap from Murray off an injury when his career high is 21.2 in a bubble year"
Trae young
"No way, he wasn’t even supposed to make it last season  Trae Young is taking his spot"
"&gt;Also the lakers hold nothing compared to the nets, so don’t even trying to compare the two.  You're right, there is no comparison between the 60-win pace, 1st seeded Lakers and KD+roleplayers. Lakers would have that shit over in 5 games.   &gt;Second of all you didn’t even rebut my statement about the bucks stopping the lakers, just said some passive aggressive hoe shit.  All you did was call something subjective a fact with zero supporting evidence. Don't expect me to be posting a dissertation-length rebuttal off that bullshit lmfao. I swear it's always the people doing the least that expect the most.   &gt;The lakers faced the 8th blazers first round  Wait, the first seed played the 8th seed in the first round?!?! I can tell that you're salty as hell cause you deadass thought this nonsense made sense lol.   &gt;harden by himself in the second  I know you weren't watching bball back then, but WB was on that team. That Rockets team was more formidable than the hobbled Trae Young + roleplayers the Bucks had to beat to get to the finals. Shit, didn't even have to play against Trae last two lol.   &gt;taken to 6 games against a Miami heat team that had dragic out, bam missing multiple games due to a messed up shoulder and Jimmy twisting his ankle  Same Heat that embarassed y'all, btw. But lemme guess, ""that doesn't count!"" Sadly for y'all, those of us who watched aren't gonna forget. Also, you wanna talk Injuries? Let's talk about Harden and Kyrie? Or maybe Trae young? Or maybe the guys y'all faced in the finals' opponents.   &gt;even with the lakers shooting above their heads career wise  Lakers shot 35.1% from three that finals. This was with KCP and Danny green (career 44% 3pt shooter in the finals up til then)  shooting 30.2 28.9, respectively. It's real funny how their 3pt% was somehow still lower than the Bucks during the finals yet somehow it's the Lakers who got lucky with hot shooting.   &gt;The fact that both teams that made the finals ended up getting bounced in the first round this year, perfectly illustrates how fraudulent that bubble run was.  It shouldn't have to be explained that you can't extrapolate two different seasons with different roster constructions and circumstances lol. I guess 2011 Mavs and 2014 Spurs didn't deserve their ring cause they got bounced in the first round the following seasons."
"because dudes like Trae Young carry like that constantly, that's why you can't even contain these small guards with a trap anymore they just pick the ball up and go around you"
I don't value those selections much at all. DeMar made all NBA second team but was nowhere near a top 10 player. He couldn't even make the all star game in 3 years with the spurs. Ben Simmons made the all star team over Trae Young this season even though Trae is clearly better than him.
"was he THAT bad defensively? he's long and fairly quick. he isn't getting absolutely destroyed on defense like a CJ or Trae Young. it feels more like an issue of being a 6'1"" SG most of the time."
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
"Idk if this is crazy to say, but I’d rather have rozier. I think Collins is JAG who’s stats are hyperinflated by Trae. Bro put up like 13/9 in the playoffs idk, just not high on Collins. I like a lot of the other young hawks guys tho"
"Do you like heros or villains.  Hero show is Golden State. Curry owns America's heart.  Villain show is in Atlanta. Trae Young is the less attractive, balding version of Steph Curry and does not give a fuck. Both teams should do well but everyone will root for GSW while most will root against ATL. Pick your side."
hawks win the next 10 finals and trae young is elected president of the united states
"Zion Williamson will sign with the Atlanta Hawks. I firmly believe he wanted to be drafted by them and play with Trae Young, and would fit amazingly into their lineup."
"Trae Young by far. He'll be in positions where I think he's finna get his shit sent, a massive brick, or a turnover and he still pulls some shit off.   It's why even when he's having a bad game, you just know he's a few shots away from a hotstreaks at all times"
"KD &amp; Jokic have some of the deepest bags in the league.  I would also include Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, Luka Doncic and CJ McCollum on there as well.  LeBron also has a pretty excellent bag of tricks but it feels like he has relied so much on being bigger, stronger &amp; faster than everyone to get to his spots it's not as flashy as some of the other guys on this list."
"It’s an easy way to make your player look better, because there aren’t many reliable ways to measure defensive impact (hence the “eye test”).  I find it funny how *every* bad defender suddenly became average, according to fans. Apparently KAT, Harden, Trae Young, and Jokic all magically became “average” defenders overnight. I’m sure if IT never got injured, we’d hear the same thing about him eventually."
I agree that they shouldn’t plan out the whole season with games on the national TV calendar I do not want every national game to be a fan vote. The suits at the network should just pick the game that has the most potential to be competitive and I’m sure the marquee teams and players will get a lot of those spots. I just don’t want to see a Trae Young vs Zion on National television with no Zion (even though last night game went to the wire).
"If a foul occurred it would be a defensive foul. Paul does not veer off his path in an abrupt manner, as he was already moving across court. The dribbler is allowed to stop and contact from behind fault of defender.   https://mobile.twitter.com/nbaofficial/status/1443591531953332224?lang=en The second video with Trae Young is an example"
It's crazy because you don't see Trae Young complaining or struggling as much
"This is unironically LeBron’s fault. Had people thinking that it’s just effort because he spent years going from mediocre to DPOY whenever he felt like it, like anybody can do that.  Everybody makes good defensive plays sometimes, just like awful shooters hit threes sometimes. I watched Jordan Nwora stuff the shit out of KD going downhill like a week ago and that is hard, but he’s not exactly the new Giannis. It’s one good play out of 100 possessions in a game. But Trae Young reads a play and jumps a passing lane or Jokic blows up one pick and roll and all of a sudden they’re alright actually, just ignore everything else."
"“When you’re built like prime Shaq, I don’t think you should get the same whistle as a guy like Trae Young”  “I just think refs should call the whistle the same for everybody”"
"he gets fouled a good number of the time, sure. but when you're built like prime Shaq, I don't think you should get the same whistle as a guy like Trae Young. I've watched him commit blatant offensive fouls and then get two free throws. I get the superstar whistle but I just think refs should call the whistle the same for everybody."
NBA(trae) Young(boy) is better
"You're failing to see the difference between this video and what CP3 did. Trae young often gets HIS defender on his back and this is legal; as long as he doesn't make non-basketball moves attempting to draw a foul, these are offensive now. This is what your own video is describing.   What CP3 did is the exact same thing that Pat Bev did except in this case the defender avoided the contact with CP3. If the defender had ran into CP3 while CP3 was making a non-basketball move impeding a defender while moving then it would have been called an offensive foul just like was called on Bev.    Read the rules, this is an offensive foul and non-basketball move and it is not the same as getting your own defender on your back which is still legal."
"It's not awful, it's good but not excellent. Trae Young averaged 9.1 assists to 4.1 TOV last year, which is just a bit better than 2:1, and he is widely (and rightfully) considered as one of the best playmakers in the entire league."
"I personally still like him, but i think hes got that playoff Trae Young/73 win Steph Curry sort of cockiness to him that can make him very unlikeable to fans of the other teams.   Im not saying he isnt a likeable guy or a good teammate, but i think he definitely can play up that pest role to be an agitator (like CP3)."
I didn't know the Bucks signed Trae Young just to try to guard KD
trae young syndrome. this sub was salivating at the prospect of lamelo being a bust so they're unwilling to admit how good he is
"I’ll seen a few people overeating lamelo here, like I’ve seen people say Melo &gt; Ja or that Melo will be a taller Trae young  and stuff like that, but I agree it’s mostly Instagram Twitter and YouTube"
Hell yeah I totally agree. Seeing Trae Young not get calls while Harden/Nash complain about lack of FT opportunities is hilarious to me.
There were a few of these that didn’t get called last night. Harden tried running into Lowry to draw a defensive foul on him and didn’t get the call. Pat Bev did the same thing CP3 did here and actually got an OF called on him for it. And Trae Young I think got the ball taken from him during a possession so he tried to draw a quick foul on the guy to stop a fast break and even put his hand up to say “I’m fouling him” but the refs ignored him lol  There were probly many more but those were the ones I saw. I’m glad they’re putting a stop to that mess. Makes the game more fun to watch
Trae Young looks like my dad's dick. I haven't seen my dad's dick but he still looks like shit!
"Then I'm fucking delusional. Your whole franchise celebrates when Embiid does it right under the basket, so don't tell me it's a problem with the play, it's a problem with the player Trae Young or who ever. Why can't you precious Thybulle avoid the contact of Young (not that this specific matchup even occurred a lot last playoffs) on defense, when Young have to avoid Thybulles charges on offensive? It makes no sense and is a clear advantage for the defensiv player. And all this for the most skill less part of basketball even I could do in the NBA. Taking charges."
I don't think it's that extreme but I do think they might be better on offense than on defense this year for the first time in what seems like forever  Ja is almost like Trae Young with his offensive impact vs. defensive impact(although IMO not quite as extreme on either end) so a team centered around him being like this isn't shocking
If nobody got me I know trae young got me

"Nah. Not all time. Just didn’t bother reading all your whiny excuses…..  you’re like the fan version of trae young. All whine, no substance."
FUCK TRAE YOUNG
And Trae Young is on his way to DC
"&gt;*trae young 31 points 3 free throws*   &gt;   &gt;*find a new slant* r/nba  I thought his foul-baiting (pre-new rules) was honestly pretty smart.  His disadvantage in the league is being undersized so it was a good way to combat that. He's small but quick, and by foul-baiting he could take advantage of guys guarding him aggressively.  Which meant space.  Which meant his ass was already at the basket. If you give him space, he's too fast, if you guard him too close (and most guys are bigger than him,) he's foul-baiting you and not letting you outsize him.  He's always been talented. I thought that was just a clever component of his game."
Yeah man gg. Trae Young and Collins are special. Glad we could give y’all a game without Zion
"Seems dumb to me tbh, he's still an absurdly talented player. People act like exploiting loopholes in the rules was all that got him into the NBA as if he isn't one of the most prolific scorers ever.   Trae Young did exactly what he did and he's doing perfectly fine, so I'm gonna say it's pretty much 100% the injury thing"
GO TRAE YOUNG.
trae young 30 points 3 free throws  find a new slant r/nba
Trae Young MVP campaign incoming.
Trae young was a all star in his second year. Pretty wild
Trae Young is a magician
"This game should be on tv. You get a battle of the titans in Durant vs. Butler, but you also get the battle of allstar level talent in Harden vs. Herro too. It's a 2-for-1.  Instead we get Trae Young vs. David Griffin."
Or most of the time the person that is up the floor is a smaller guard that was near the middle of the floor and realistically they aren't stopping the break if they try to play defense. These fouls usually don't happen when multiple players are in a position to get back and stop a break the old-fashioned way. If Trae Young is the one man back after some wing player just ripped someone or intercepted a pass and is on their way down court what legitimate chance does he have at actually stopping the break without fouling?
"There’s lots of parlance about “max” because of how it scales for different players. Ayton isn’t eligible for the Luka or Trae Young level max, and was negotiating for the Andrew Wiggins style max. By failing to come to agreement he’s likely to have to find a max offer in restricted free agency, which yet again will come with lower %s of raise increases allowed over the deal in addition to 1 less year on it.   If Ayton wants to avoid that scenario, he can either take the qualifying offer for a 1 year deal and be fully unrestricted (I think his qualifying offer is just short of 20 million), or he can make sure he negotiates for a player option in whichever contract he signs before forcing the Suns to decide whether to match. Notably the 2+1 structure on restricted free agents has shown success in making teams pass on matching to retain players. Restricted free agents have veto power during their first year of matched by their original team, so by the time the Suns would be able to unilaterally trade Ayton again he’d be approaching free agency at the end of the season or opting into a subsequent 1 year/35M+."
Trae Young fine as long as he stays outta dyckman
Real question is where's Trae Young when his children are bickering like this
it would only be unsafe for Trae Young because of dumb fans
"My hottake - Trae Young is special and will become the face of the league, or one of them, when Lebron retires.   Even more scandalous and scorching hot, I'd take Trae Young over Allen Iverson, Dame, Kyrie all day with no questions asked. Near equal if not better than them in some cases via volume &amp; efficiency and is a much more elite playmaker than all 3 by a country mile.   Another one, Trae is a better playmaker than Luka &amp; is a better floor general &amp; boosts his team's performance by the numbers when hes on the floor"
"From the interview   “**One player comes to mind as you bring up all of these ideologies and sports science methods the Heat have used the last few seasons: Tyler Herro. Massive talent, but doesn’t always crack the rotation. How do you bring him along with your brand of tough love?**  Oh man, he’s a tough kid. He’s tougher than a lot of people think. He wants the tough love, actually.  **Really?**  I tiptoed around it a few times, but he said, “Nah, OG. I ain’t soft.” He wants it. I give him that. I wasn’t sure about him. I saw him play in college. He’s not soft at all. Just needed to get stronger. He has the will, has the passion, has the right mindset. He just wasn’t physically there yet. People forget he was 19 years old. And regardless of how well he played offensively, he was still only 19. A lot of people took advantage of that, and, rightfully so...a lot of people took it upon themselves to put [Herro] in a lot of actions and beat him up out there. But offensively? I’ve never seen a kid be able to do what he was able to do at 19 or 20 years old. But, hell yeah: he can take it. He definitely can take it. He part of the Dog Pound now. OG love you to death. But I will be brutally honest wit’ yo’ ass, boy.  **He said recently that he deserves to be in the same conversation as Luka Doncic and Trae Young and the other young stars of the NBA. Is that what you’ve seen?**  Facts. He just hasn’t been given the keys. He came to a team that’s been successful and didn’t need a superstar right away...he came into a different situation. But skillswise, talent wise, damn right. Them other boys ain’t been to the Finals yet, and that’s not to knock them, but you see what [Herro] did. Boy got game. Straight up and down. And if he was on a team, probably not a good team, and he got to go out there and do his thing? Damn right he’d be in those conversations.”"
"Quoting u/ozymandias12    Some great nuggets in this GQ Profile of OG:  He wants to play 20 seasons:  What do I get outta this? 20 years. If I can get 20 years it’ll be an amazing career for a kid that no one thought would play in the league. All my sacrifices, everything I’ve given, the only thing I’ve asked for is to try to get to 20. I wanna give that to myself, and I wanted to give it to my father.  Haslem thinks Tyler deserves to be in the Luka and Trae conversation:  Facts. He just hasn’t been given the keys. He came to a team that’s been successful and didn’t need a superstar right away...he came into a different situation. But skillswise, talent wise, damn right. Them other boys ain’t been to the Finals yet, and that’s not to knock them, but you see what [Herro] did. Boy got game. Straight up and down. And if he was on a team, probably not a good team, and he got to go out there and do his thing? Damn right he’d be in those conversations.  Haslem almost left Miami because they didn't want to pay him:  Shit, I was almost outta here — they ain’t have no money left. I was about gone. They wasn’t saving enough for me. They just wanted the big boys. They wasn’t thinking about me, the only one who was was [Wade]. He understood my importance to this city and franchise and thank God he did because it paid off.  Haslem explains why the Bubble wasn't a fluke and how the team approached the situation:  I only stayed in my room or played cards with Jimmy [Butler]. Even LeBron, as much as I love Bron, I didn’t hang out with Bron one time in the bubble. My guys need to understand what we’re here for. They’re young: they don’t need to see me kickin’ it with Bron, playing cards with Bron. We here for a reason. I want to beat Bron. I don’t need you confused! They don’t understand how I can kick it with somebody and wanna rip they head off.  I ain’t leave my room. I ain’t fraternize with nobody. And for three, four months, it was just about that. What pisses me off, man, is that people discredit what [the Heat] did in the bubble because we didn’t have a great season the very next season. Don’t get mad at me because your favorite team and favorite player was a mental midget in the bubble. Trying to fry chicken and have pool parties and shit, we ain’t here for that. Ain’t our fault motherfuckers was soft!...why discredit us? The Lakers ain’t make the playoffs the next season either and ain’t nobody sayin’ shit about them!...that takes nothing away from what we did the year before. Doesn’t change that Milwaukee swept us last year, we still beat they ass two years ago! It’s still in the record books! They whipped our ass and we whipped their ass."
"&gt; Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  Rudy Gobert is top 1 lol"
"- Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  - Kyle Kyzma is top 5 in RPG (rebounds per game), higher than his former teammate Anthony Davis.   - Kevin Porter Jr. is averaging 6.3 turnovers per game to start the season, by far the league leader in this category."
"The NBA is better when the Knicks are competitive. God, I can’t wait for ATL vs NYK Xmas game.  Trae Young still ain’t good in Dyckman."
"i agree that deal was always terrible, why give 100+ million to a point who can't shoot he also is a willing passer when he wants to be, he isn't a trae young or kyle lowry whos actively seeking to pass the ball, kick it ahead."
"He was in no way even close to his 2016 form so I’m glad you mentioned that   Westbrook played in the 2020 NBA, where Trae Young basically did 30/10 efficiently and Bradley Beal put up prime Kobe numbers.  It’s a joke compared to what was possible in 2016 before space and pace.   And does he really get the benefit of the doubt on his COVID thing when every playoff run before and after was the exact same disaster, and statistically similar?  And it’s not like he was playing smart. Westbrook was running around doing dumb shit in the 2020 playoffs that had nothing to do with injury."
Fuck Trae Young!  *Fuck Trae Young! Fuck Trae Young! Fuck Trae Young!*
Trae young is more impactful than luka doncic
3. Nearly open lane to dunk over trae young? Hard pass.
Idk man...Prime Bogut would be my pick. At least wouldn't be afraid of Trae Young.
Would Trae Young be valid in Dyckman then?
"I love this, Trae Young ended his time in Philly. There's no way he can comfortably come back and play in Philly the way things are going."
"see, this is something this subreddit overlooked at.  many people are happy that the refs this season arent calling as much fouls as the last season specially the foul baiting in the 3pt line or the trae young ""pause"", but this hides the fact that the refs are still shit when they do have to call a foul, lmfao."
Trae young gonna be a bust. Too undersized and doesn’t look the part.   Particularly egregious since I’m a Steph curry fan
Yeah yeah ben had a bad series but trae young knew he where ben was
Team is in trouble until we can get Ben back and get him going. Guy needs to push through the mental issues. He can't disappear in the 4th quarter and he can't get scared of leukemia patients like trae young.
"I thought that too lol. I remember debating with a few people at work on who should the cavs take and everyone was giving their answers and the one guy said trae young and we all started dogging him lol saying he's too short, undersized, he won't last long in the nba etc and man we were all wrong. But then again who knows if cavs organization would've helped with his development or not"
Trae Young not being built for the league lol
"Ayy you think Trae Young is still good? He’s still not good in Dyckman, we smoking on that Boston pack you hear me-"
Trae Young is closer to AI status than he is Curry status. Also agree with you on AI
At the very start of last year's season there was a thread after a great OKC game about who you'd rather have Lou Dort or Trae Young. I was pretty strong in arguing that Lou Dort given his super cheap contract was the better option. I was dumb.
"The ""Trae Young looks like a lollipop that fell on the carpet"" jokes absolutely kill me lol"
"Lol yea that's what I meant. Someone who can shoot it that good, but with less tendencies for sloppy turnovers will be the greatest offensive force in league history. Also maybe a bit better court vision. Curry can pass, but he is not a maestro with the ball like Nash, Rondo, Kidd used to be. Even Trae Young is a better passer and decision-maker with the ball."
I agree.  I’m just saying there’s a risk when you tank for more than two years with your young star.  No matter how many future picks they have.  They don’t want to deal with the whole can ____ win like Booker and Trae had to go through.
"Cause Kemba and Horford are pretty close to washed and keeping them to try and make play in tournaments with Shai would be more of a waste of our time with him than trying to put a good young team around him like the Hawks did with Trae Young or the Suns did with Devin Booker.. so that y’know, we actually have a shot at keeping him for the real long term"
Commiserating about getting beat by Trae Young
"I don’t think they’re unlikable but I do think a lot of them are really boring and bland.   Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, Trae Young are injecting a lot of life into the league. I like Scottie Barnes’ energy. We need some juice"
Trae Young still ain't valid
Danny Green and Trae Young
"The nice thing about MSG is that it's kept its name throughout it all, there's so much fuckin history there. This isn't the American Airlines Arena/Center, this isn't the fuckin' Smoothie King land, this is the fuckin' garden. It is its own place. I saw Travis Scott on this same floor that I saw Fleetwood Mac, and when Trae Young bowed for his arrival to the playoffs. Freddie Mercury, Patrick Ewing, Jordan all played in that stadium.   #This place fucks."
cant stand trae young rat looking ass
"I'm not claiming that the NBA has perfect parity, I'm claiming that I don't think perfect parity should be the goal. The NFL, is growing 2 to 3 times slower than the NBA is, despite having more parity.   My claim is that for most NBA fans if ""your team"" doesn't make the playoffs they will still tune in for a lot of playoff games because the story lines are compelling. People care about seeing the Lakers or the Nets win/lose. People love seeing Giannis with a chance to win a title. People love seeing if Luka can carry the Mavs deep into the playoffs. Hell, Trae Young and the Hawks was compelling. Almost every playoff series was good because of the concentration of talent.   The post-season product is better if more stars make the playoffs. You can't have that if you spread everyone out in the name of parity. It MIGHT make the regular season more interesting, but it would hurt the post season.  More parity also means that injuries will play a bigger role in deciding how far teams make it in the playoffs. If the team is just KD and a bunch of role players because of a hard cap then if KD goes down, even for a couple of games, that's the series. If teams have more than one star player they might be able to hang on long enough for that player to return.  My final point as to why too much parity is bad is that the two times of major growth for the NBA were during the Jordan Bulls and the Kobe/Shaq Lakers. There was even less parity in the league then, but the sport took off because people tuned in to see those teams, and whether you wanted to see them win or lose it was still compelling. Is it harder for small market teams, yes. Is it impossible, not even close; freaking Milwaukee just won a chip."
"Derrick ""Better than Trae Young"" White"
IS TRAE YOUNG VALID?!?
The ball just stops mid-air for what feels like half a second everytime Trae Young dribbles
trae young will be too assuming he makes an all-nba team
"&gt;Mid range jump shots are incredibly difficult for a low pay out.  Okay, I can appreciate that analysis with respect to the current culture we are expected to esteem. Would you say the midrange had a low playoffs payout for the Clips when they resorted to it more, post-Kawhi? How about the Suns? Do you think they had a low payout/underperformed in the 2021 playoffs *---because that NBA Finals did feat. Book and CP3 display midrange mastery*.  Consider when Trae Young was hurting in the playoffs and Giannis was hurting too. Their leaders went more to the midrange games for success. You see how that worked out for MIL without Giannis in there. Then in the NBA Finals... Giannis midrange mastery goes unsaid. True?  Moreover... feel free to bless the area with your thoughts on how the payout of DeMar's midrange mastery is impacting the Bulls, so far?"
Battle of the teams eliminated by Trae Young
No he’s no a better facilitator he just has a higher usage rate. Warriors and hawks play different styles of ball one where trae young has the 24/7 and the warriors flow offence where they swing the ball and allow everyone a touch until they find the open man.
"Luka has a bad 3pt? He shot 35% last season without anyone to get him open looks. That's higher than, for example Trae Young, and only slightly worse than James Harden"
Trae Young used to be underrated and is now overrated because the team he is playing on is stacked.
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Trae young got the same contract as Luka.   So...suggests he is also a supermax rookie extension player.  And what about Donovan Mitchell's 5 195 rookie max?  What about Paul George? Kevin Durant?  Anthony Davis? Jimmy Butler?
"Idk dude. I love trae young. But I think you’re overlooking how fucking stacked that roster is. Cappella is way better than Dwight Powell. Bogdonovic is way better than Hardaway Jr. John Collins is probably better than Porzingis at this point. Huerter, Hunter, Reddish feels way more reliable and useful than finney-smith, Brunson, and Bullock.  Luka’s on/off last year are similar. With him on the floor, the Mavericks had an offensive rating of 118.5, the best offense in the league ahead of Utah’s 118.4 last year (and one of the all time greatest). Off the floor the Mavericks slipped to bottom 5 (~110.1).  Given his size and ability to post up, I just trust him a little more than trae to carry a team over the finish line in the last 2 minutes of crazy intense playoff games. Love em both. I just naturally have to give the edge to the guy who’s size let’s him play and win in a myriad of ways."
"Trae Young is a better overall player than Luka Doncic  He's still pretty ball dominant but not quite as much and creates better looks(there's no more high quality pass than into an open dunk, which he creates far more often)  Luka should be a better scorer in theory but in practice they've been about equally efficient on similar volume  Trae is obviously the worse defender but Luka is pretty terrible himself  Also Luka doesn't do much in 4th quarters because of his conditioning"
"I think you're right, but it's a bit of a grey area too. Sometimes it's smarter to step aside than risk and-1 play, if you know you're in a bad position to defent it anyway. But if you can defend it, and you're just afraid of the poster so you slide away, then yeah that should be embarrassing. Player size difference should be in equation as well. Except Trae ""Defensive Juggernaut"" Young."
"Ben Simmons because…  Realistic case: 3x RotY, 3x All-Star. Barely lost to elite rim protector, Trae Young."
"came down to him vs lillard, i prefer lillard, but am not gonna fight you if you think luka is better.  that is the tricky part, such a huge glut of top end talent in the league. on any given night, 25 guys can look like top 10 guys.  hon mention: luka, cp3, jimmy butler, tatum, pg, zion, brad beal, trae young, donovan mitchell, kat, d book.  luka probably wouldnt make my top ten list, but he belongs in tier 3 imo"
"We went from ""The Hawks can't defend period, or score without Trae"" to Young-Bogi-Hunter-Collins-Capela-Reddish-Gallo-Lou-Huerter-Deng, that's a deep lineup that could get deep in the playoffs. They seem like an early pick for 3 seed behind the 2 big boys (assuming BKN even tries to go for seeding)"

Mobley guards 1-5.  He was shutting down Trae young on drives.
I’m just saying in a pick up game basketball players would almost universally be too embarrassed to call the kinds of cheap fouls that Harden and CP3 and Trae Young have been pulling.
He would be top 5. Put him with trae young and its over lol.
"Anyone still have that copypasta of that one post to the effect of ""Dear Nate Bjorkgren, stop Trae Young with Drop Coverage"" that got mass upvoted?"
1 playoff win  trae young and terrence ross own your franchise
Trae Young has a 75% career combined Usage + Assist %
because he's not a turnover merchant like Trae Young has been his entire career
"Definitely. The pass out on an open dunk opportunity because a weak defender in Trae Young was closing was the cherry on top. If Ben makes that and 76ers lose with 3min left in the game still. I don't think we'd have this conversation. Certainly his performance would be under the microscope, but nowhere near this level of animosity."
"Dude, he shouldn’t have been in that position in the first place, what the hell! Simmons gave up a dunk on Trae “Height Starts With 5” Young come the fuck on  https://youtu.be/-EHA4UhYuQY"
They don’t rank higher rn. need to do way more it’s really just lack of experience they’re too young. If they showed out like luka or trae it’d be different story
He is the next trae young
These aren't even regular 3's these are like Trae Young 3's. Dame Lillard 3's.
"Nice of thybulle to stick up for his friend, but Bens not getting paid 35 million per year to pass up dunking on Trae young down by 2."
"I don’t think I’d agree. In fact, with how unique of a defender Ben Simmons is, If he weren’t already a started, I could even see teams bringing him in off the bench at the end of a game to guard the other teams biggest scoring threat. Similar to how trae young is sometimes subbed out for some end game possessions when the hawks need to preserve a lead"
"Trae Young  If he's able to come out this season, ice the entire league and lead the Hawks to their first ring in Atlanta? With how much the city already loves him, and FMVP beating out the rest of his stacked draft class to a first ring?  Schlenk would go from being a great GM to the clear best GM in the league - the Hawks would be representing a huge possibility of a dynasty era with how young and locked in this core is while still having considerable assets.  Jimmy Butler with a ring/FMVP I think also dramatically changes the way history views him and his journey in the league."
"People were like that predraft and during the rookie season too. I like Luka a lot (a whole lot), but there were people who insisted on not only that Luka be a superstar, but that *everyone* else near him had to be a bust as well, to *punish them* for doubting Luka. They would *insist* that Deandre Ayton and Trae Young were busts and try to argue for it no matter what. That whole thing got uncomfortable."
"Never will for me. Death is just hard for me to accept. I've had friends, family pass away during my life. It never feels right IMO. Norm MacDonald's death 100% does not feel real either. Like my brain can't accept it.      Still, something makes me happy these young guys like Luka, Booker, Trae etc got to meet Kobe. They're the future. And at the beginning of their careers Kobe was there, he was accessible and they will be a kind of be a bridge from when Kobe was around. If that makes any sense."
I imagine that it's hard to carry your max teammate (who refuses to shoot or dunk over Trae Young) all game on a torn meniscus.
"I know people like to pinpoint on that one play over Trae Young and it gets overstated, but it was not an exaggeration to say Ben Simmons had an awful performance for the series and lacked aggressiveness. Simmons took the 11th most FGA of both teams that series. He belittled himself to role player status and took less than 5 shots in 3 of those games. Forgot unwilling to shoot in the clutch, he was barely shooting all game. His series was defined by way more than just that one play."
I am so fucking jealous of you guys. I will root for Trae Young unless against the Bulls. I still believe he's a better player than Luka based on winning attitude. We'll see in the coming years.
"&gt;Oh you’re right in that very specific case it’s totally normal and acceptable to shit talk your teammates after a playoff loss /s  You mean Doc making a comment that while could've been phrased better was very mild and Embiid answering the turning point question by noting a sequence of plays that started with Ben passing up the dunk (but by saying ""We"", as in the team, instead of Ben himself) but continued with a mistakes that the team made immediately on defense that led to a Trae Young 3 and even ended his comment by pointing out that he, himself made a costly turnover?   I could sort of get the outrage behind the Doc comment, even though I think the outrage is dumb, but Embiid made it very clear that it was a team loss and WASN'T fully on Ben. Hell Embiid actually took more responsibility than he gave for Ben (who again was not mentioned by name)."
"Okay can we actually have an honest convo about this, and I get I’m a hawks fan but this is no bias cause I actually love Luka. What exactly gets Luka ranked that high outside of his potential compared to some of the other guys around him both in and out of his age group. Luka definitely is the best young player but how big is the gap between him and Mitchell, Booker, Trae, Tatum, etc.   And again this isn’t bias I’m a huge Luka fan and think he’s gonna be the face of the league"
JJ my dude he backed down from dunking on Trae Young
I wouldn’t call it basically giving him away. We’ll see how their careers turn out but I’m pretty fucking thrilled with Trae Young and the team we’ve built around him
"So who is the biggest snub here?  Gobert doesn't impress me enough, for whatever reason.  Zion is still too raw, I think, and I don't trust KAT.  Trae Young?  I have to think that playoff run did wonders for his rep.  CP3/Kyrie/Booker?   It's remarkable that tis list has no one from the 2021 Western Conference Champions."
"Because Joe isn’t scared of the moment, he just shot like hot garbage. People shit on Ben because he’s a 1st overall pick on a max contract, and he’s afraid to shoot the ball in a big moment. I’m not gonna be upset with a teammate that shoots a good shot and misses, but I absolutely will for a teammate that has a good shot and doesn’t take it.   In summary, Joe Harris would’ve dunked on Trae Young"
Trae young MVP
Hypothetically what would happen if you caught Trae Young in Dyckman?
Trae is even making [ads promoting vaccinations](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-health-partners-with-trae-young-and-turner-sports-to-help-drive-covid-19-vaccinations-in-atlanta-301303934.html)
i’m taking trae young over Jb any day of the week
"$35 mil a year, for that much Simmons deserves the critism for never improving and being exposed on the court multiple years. Still can't believe his almost 7ft ass passed out on a dunk opportunity on 6ft Trae Young."
"Suggs wins ROY magic make the play in.   Nets and Lakers fall short again, I would even say Lakers in first round.   Trae Young is top 3 MVP race, Hawks top 3 seed in the East  Ben Simmons is traded and has an all star season again.   Someone drops 70+ in a game."
"A bit confused with your point but if you’re trying to say Simmons did not slow him down because he was averaging 29/3/10 on the series. With that said though, he had extremely poor efficiency shooting 39% from the field and 32% from 3. Playoffs tend to be a slugfest which this can be attributed to as well but Trae Young was definitely not a dominant scoring threat at times. Also, I cannot find full statistics on this so you’ll just have to trust the word of Kevin O’Connor, an NBA analyst who pointed out that in game 1 of that series Trae dropped 35/2/10 on 48% from the field. He was guarded by Simmons 8 times that game. Switch to game 2 and Simmons guards Trae for 31 plays and Trae drops 21/3/11 on 37% from the field. This obviously isn’t a representation of how the series went as a whole, but it’s clear that Simmons had great impact in winning that second game by slowing Trae down. Idk how Doc played Simmons later on in the series, but I feel if the strategy was to shut down Trae with Simmons, it would’ve been far more effective in my eyes"
"No one said he's the only issue, but he's by far the biggest.  You must not realize how bad having your 2nd highest player get fouled off the court because of his incompetence at the line hurts your team.  You blow 20 point leads when your best defender, and by most metrics, the defender giving Trae Young the hardest time, is not only played off the court, but then you have guys like George Hill coming in.  It's obviously not entirely Ben's fault, but he deserved every single bit of accountability he received and this dates back to the Toronto series."
"No one else failed in the same way.  Who else would you like held accountable? Seth Curry? Tobias Harris? Doc Rivers?  Tobias gets crucified by the fans all the time, but even he isn't SO BAD at any part of the game that he gets played off the court.  Seth Curry's offense was the only thing that was consistent outside of Embiid. His defensive burden was an issue but considering he was our second most important offensive player he can have a pass.  Doc Rivers? Literally, everyone holds him accountable and shits on him relentlessly.   Ben Simmons is the common denominator of issues for 3 consecutive years. Ben Simmons is great on one side of the court, and was such a burden on the other end and to the team as a whole that he had to be benched because he can't even manage to shoot 50% from the FT line. Ben Simmons passed up a wide open dunk out of fear that Trae ""Rudy Gobert"" Young would block him. Ben Simmons deserved to be held accountable."
Beal #14 and Trae young #15. Sorry but Butler should not be on this list.
"The issue is though is there never a guarantee that Ben can slow those guys down in a playoff series. People like Durant or Bron at their current ages have pretty much dominated any one on one matchups they have had.   Also as great as Ben has been on a player like Harden or Trae Young, what still gets lost is Embiids help defense. Just the fact that Ben is able to shade those player is more proof that Embiid and him still have to go hand in hand. We saw multiple times where Ben was able to funnel Trae into Embiid and force a tough floater.   No defender is consistently able to stay in front of their guy, or get around every screen. Especially not to the level of rim protectors protecting the rim. Ben would get scored on a lot more if Enes Kanter was at the rim instead of Joel."
"I mean you can say the same about most teams last season such as the Heat and even the Bulls. Most teams were injured at some point.   Of course like you said, everything is surface level cause the season hasn't started yet but i'm totally open to being wrong since I loved Trae Young in the playoffs."
"&gt; you don’t see draymond guarding somebody like trae young for a whole game   Great! We don’t need him to guard Trae, that’s Wiggins job. Show me him locking up Zion, or AD, or Ayton, or Giannis. If he can do THAT as well as Dray then you’ve got a case, but he doesn’t."
You make no sense draymond is a power forward he is constantly guarding players who play on the inside where Ben is guarding elite guards and forwards from trae young to harden to kd to bron to kd so no shit him playing on the perimeter more is going to effect his stats
You sound goofy as hell . Draymond average .2 more blocks both averaged under a block a game stop acting draymond some type of shot blocker . And you think ben being second in dpoty was for nothing ? Ben can guard everybody more efficient then draymond can you don’t see draymond guarding somebody like trae young for a whole game you see possession of him doing it but ben doing that shit all game guarding the best player on other teams
Trae young
"Ding ding ding.   Using a guys playoffs runs to justify him being better... hasn't won a series yet. You know who else didn't have an amazing supporting cast, no all stars on the team (including himself)?  Trae Young!"
"Thank you for asking.  Defenses are not in full control of whether a foul gets called.  Nowadays, flopping is more than exaggerating contact. We used to mostly see defenders exaggerating slight contact in order to influence a foul call. In some of those situations, fouls were the technically correct call. But skilled floppers are now more skilled at manufacturing foul calls while initiating contact.   We have seen floppers be rewarded for initiating contact on, or faking contact with, a player in a legal defensive position. Thus, your comment “don’t foul someone if you don’t want them to get free throws” shows a lack of understanding for what’s going on.   I don’t know any notable floppers on the Raptors. However, I’m sure you all have faced James Harden or Trae Young enough to be able to understand that defenses don’t always control whether a foul is called. Players are now manipulating officials and getting awarded for it. And for the most part, all defenders can do is flail their hands in the air after the call. And if they show too much emotion they’ll get a tech.  It’s becoming more difficult to play defense in the NBA."
Was Trae Young a rookie when he did that? Probably felt that he shouldn't be doing that if he's a rookie if so.
Trae Young in shambles
"Trae seems more like more specific fit and less flexible to me due to his size. While I haven't followed him super closely I get the sense that he's in that Nash/AI type of situation that he can be very effective as team's main offensive engine if team composition supports what he is great at and covers his weaknesses.  Now while Beal isn't crazy flexible himself (as far as I know his creation is not much to write home about), he is still much more versatile in that sense compared to Young.  Defensively it's quite interesting since they both seemingly played the same defensive role according to match up data. While they both are clear negatives there is quite a significant difference in effectiveness in favor of Beal. In their defensive role I would put Trae as weakest player last season and Beal somewhere in worst 10-20 range.  Overall I would say they are close in effectiveness and for any practical purposes need would be main decider rather than difference in skill etc. If would need to rank them in order I would probably put Beal first currently. While I would agree that Young provides slightly more value offensively currently than Beal he unfortunately loses that edge to Beal (in my opinion) when defense is considered, since ""both are bad"" doesn't mean they are equally bad or otherwise that would also apply to their offensive skills as ""both are good""."
"Awards mean next to nothing to me, he’s the only player of guys in the top 5 who care enough about awards to try that hard for them, the rest of those dudes skate through the regular season to save themselves for the playoffs. It’s insane that Giannis can play 100% in the reg season and playoffs and still be so effective, but it’s like winning a race when the rest of your competitors are running half speed.  Again tho, context matters. If someone looked at this years playoffs without context they’d see Giannis beating KD and harden, then snapping his leg In half and coming back to beat Trae young, and finally beating CP3 and booker after being down 0-2, it looks absolutely insane and like an historic run.  But with context you realize, the nets are an extremely top heavy team and having injuries to Kyrie and harden killed them. It’s still no easy task to beat KD obviously but shit man, it was basically a 1v5 and they barely won in OT.   Then the hawks series, I won’t say anything bad about the hawks because Trae is great, and they’re a good team, maybe not a finals team but it is the East. Giannis overcoming a bad leg injury was also amazing, but because of the fact that there was no structural damage to any ligaments, he bruised his knee, nothing more.    I know this is going to get downvoted like crazy and it’s cool, recency bias does crazy things. I’m not going to say the suns didn’t deserve to be where they were, they beat the teams in front of them convincingly, injuries helped them immensely, they had some lucky calls, lucky plays that went their way to get there, but they won all 3 series’ and that’s all that matters.   What I think isn’t an unpopular opinion however is that this was probably the weakest WCF team in recent memory, 20 lakers were better, all those warriors teams were better, the spurs were better. Not trying to downplay any of these teams accomplishments, every single team that wins a title has to have a bit of luck in games with calls, injury luck, good players having bad games, it happens. I’m simply saying that had heavyweights of this season the lakers, nets and even clippers not had insanely bad injury luck, we would be looking at this season and Giannis very differently. I’m not saying it’s a fluke, but it doesn’t mean anything to me either."
"Neither is Jimmy Butler. I’d take donavan mitchell, trae young, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, over both of them"
I think Trae Young should be 12 with Beal or Butler being left off.
Trae Young went to the ECF
In all seriousness I would actively start following the Hawks with a Trae Young and KAT duo
"Kill K.Love, marry Garland, fuck Sexton.  But seriously though, Garland's a good young player but I swear what sets aside *these* guards from your John Walls and Russ Westbrooks is not the outside shooting, but the floater game. Ja, Trae, LaMelo, CP3, Steph, Harden, Luka, DLo, Kyrie, Lillard, McCollum, Booker, Mitchell, etc all have it. Even if you're a bad shooter you need a floater, and it kills me that my team has recently had two insanely talented point guards who never developed one, and instead took 18 foot pull up jumpers.  It's what helped Tony Parker and Nash be special players, and for Rose to play at an MVP level. If you master the floater, you can put the big that switches on you in a blender and also facilitate a ton of offense without even being a special athlete or passer."
"He was fucking trash every playoffs 2018/2021. He wasn’t even good in 2017 he put up volume stats on all time garbage efficiency  &gt; 2018   He had a 40% TS and let rubio shit on him. He was horrible  &gt; 2020   Left wide open for harden to be doubled and was the worst player on the floor  &gt; 2021   Embiid didn’t even play and Ben Simmons still outplayed and shit on him. He was expected to struggle because he’s just not good. Little trae young dominated these 2 dpoys, russ couldn’t even beat ben"
"So Ariza was willing to get into it with Trae Young for nutmegging him but he didn't care about this? 💀💀💀  ""I'm not with the funnies"" headass"
"You never know whats gonna happen, and plus I think they dont really need a Luka or Trae . Considering their other young players like Keldon Jackson or Dejounte Murray can be good role players they need a Booker/Mitchell/Lavine level player which is way more realistic than finding a Luka"
"I'll never be convinced the 76ers did or said anything wrong after Simmons' postseason performance.  The man was afraid of driving on Trae Young and passing out of an easy bucket in the paint.  But yeah they ""failed"" Simmons.....fuck outta here"
"Oh no, the owner of a recently dynasty-team has been fined $50k!   Sidenote: Morey should be fined for asking for future sons and daughters as trade assets in return for a guy who decided not to dunk on Trae Young   Second sidenote: defensive IQ and in-game leadership is also another massive problem in comparing Draymond to Simmons"
"Not that surprised, few people watch the spurs.  The young core should produce at least 1 all star, potentially 3 all stars if everything goes absolutely perfectly, and a variety of high end role players/starters. I’d say we’re a legit cornerstone (a trae/ ja/mitchell) away from having the best young core in the league"
"I mean, with this criteria, you could even go as low as someone like Trae Young or Bradley Beal"

add trae young to my team rn for the playmaking  Add tatum to rebuilding team cuz I like him
Ant Edwards texting Trae Young talking about “tell the Hawks FO to come get me”
"The milkman argument is wrong when it’s used to say guys like Wilt and Bill wouldn’t dominate in the later eras.   But objectively, the majority of the people they played against, even with modern conditioning and medical advances, would not be NBA-level players today.  Bob Cousey, an NBA legend, would be like if Trae Young was slow. He’d be lucky to go pro at any capacity today."
"It does because you put Luka in Simmons shoes when saying ""what if the Mavs coach did that to Luka"". Luka doesn't warrant the criticism because he works.   And I'm not disagreeing Doc is a dumbass, but this is also on Ben for taking literally nothing as the greatest affront to his career. Both parties can be at fault but I find the entire thing ridiculous. Doc didn't make him at like shit, didn't make him scared of Trae young at the end of a game 7. Ben's play warranted some criticism, and it was the lightest cristicm ever lobbied at a player. Is it stupid? Fine. But if Ben's skin is that fucking thin then it's on him as well."
"&gt; Should also consider the context of this place being a literal shithole. The first reaction to Harden's injury was people laughing at KD about how he has to play without another superstar.  It was genuinely fucking gross how some people treated injuries. Still remember seeing 'haha Trae Young got injured by a ref its irony' and feeling pretty yucked. Harden and Kyrie's injuries being treated like 'karma' was a bad look.  I know I was anxious at the time, but KD showing up how he did in Game 5 and 7 (not that he wasn't still great in 6) and silencing his critics was genuinely fun to watch, even if it aged me several years. I resent people trying to spin that series as 'kd OWNS Giabum' because that angle likes to forget games other than the ones he won, but as you said it's a shithole so some people are gonna do that and some people are going to blame KD for the loss."
"Respectfully disagree. If KAT or Wiggins were even 3/4s of the players they were supposed to be, they’d have led their teams to playoffs like we’ve seen other young players do (Luka, Spida, Jokic, Ja, Trae, Tatum, etc.).   At a certain point a team/organization has to look at themselves and ask themselves if they’re really set themselves up to win."
"RAYFORD TRAE YOUNG  Tatum is obviously miles ahead defensively, but Trae can score like a machine and run an offense."
"He honesty probably thought the same thing Embiid has been thinking since he passed over Trae Young in a close out game. “I’m over here busting my ass and this mf don’t even want to attempt to score? Fuck that.” At least now the front office is ready to get rid of him. But seeing that first hand and not seeing anyone (besides fans) say “hey Ben maybe you should ya know, work on shooting the fucking ball” would definitely piss someone like Jimmy off."
"I’m not sure about that last comment, but by showing up I’m sure you mean scoring. If you think Ben Simmons is a score you should touch up on analyzing basketball. Secondly, who in the absolute f*** would the warriors go to Ben Simmons as a scoring option late in game when you have 2 of the best shooters on earth. How does Kevin Looney fit at the 5 but Ben does not?  Ben Simmons put Trae Young in prison in game 7, but hey I guess that’s not the offensive firepower you’re looking for😂"
"Ben did an excellent job on Trae Young. The issue is offense, not defense"
"Really, this should be on coaching. Why is Bledsoe in there in crunch time? Why isn’t Lonzo, a good defender, guarding Rose? Why is Lonzo on Bullock, a spot up shooter? Look at the Knicks Haws series. You don’t need a good defender on Bullock. He’s a spot up shooter. All you need is a guy standing near him as Trae Young did."
"No, pretty much 55/60 rookies priority is already fit (propably an even bigger percentage for internationals) and when it comes down to those elite 5 talents, I think it isn't that easy. I doubt Zion (as an example) would have gone to the Lakers being a 2nd unit guy behind LBJ and Davis, but I do think Charlotte would have had a good chance. Derrick Rose would have ended up in Chicago for sure and OKC would have had a good chance to get Blake Griffin or Trae Young. Back in 2013 OKC would have been the team that could have snatched some elite rookie, in the 2000s San Antonio and Detroit could have delivered great opportunities. I think this 'big market doomsday scenario' isn't really realistic. They all have billionaires funding the whole thing, there are enough options convincing a young player of yourself, especially those who just want to ball. If a Luka Doncic is ballsy enough to step into the spotlight right away, then I'm also cool with it."
"I support Ben Simmons 100%.  I mean the 76ers fans, media, players, and coach turned their back on him and wrote him off as a basketball player and his dedication to the craft. The management then tries to trade him for an asking price so ridiculous that other teams are hanging up the phone. Then they’re all looking at him like “why don’t you want to play for us? People would kill to be in your situation where you get paid just to play basketball.”    Let’s stop acting like this dude didn’t dedicate his entire life to get to where he is now. The dudes defense is All NBA level, he can’t be guarded in transition, and leads the league in generating 3 pointers. He deserves every cent he makes, and if he feels disgusted with the situation and sacrifice his money to not represent a franchise that turned its back on him, that’s his decision (AND HIS MONEY!!)  I can’t wait to watch him play next year. This dudes 25 years old. He was locking up trae young until trae would stop and bump into him for foul calls. They had to change the rules this year b/c of how BS that was.  Free Ben Simmons from the hellhole that is the 76ers management and fan base"
Ben passed out of a 1-on-1 with Trae Young. MJ will be ok.
Trae Young ruined this dude’s nba career in one playoff series
"Except he's the one who created the toxic environment lmao. Maybe hire a real shooting coach instead of your brother and actually improve your game each year, instead of being so scared that you can't dunk on Trae Young."
"Still averaged over a 3 a game as the first option, on an injury stricken year  What's Simmons shooting in the 4th quarter of elimination games when under the basket and guarded by Trae Young lol"
Trae Young as anything other than an Atlanta Hawk feels extremely incorrect. I'm not convinced the universe would allow such a thing.
C’mon man I’m a Trae Young fan but Trae Young as Philly’s most wanted is shooting low for Philly. Hawks are not suddenly contenders because they went 3 rounds and lost to the champ. They had a great run that ultimately fell short and this coming from a Sixers fan. They’re fun to root for but give it a couple more seasons
"He locked down Simmons in the 4th, anything is possible with NBA Villain Trae Young."
"Knicks?  They are now the Clippers of ny...they aren’t allowed to have rivalries yet.   Trae young is very valid and he and booker would be good rivals, if they meet enough times in the playoffs, which would naturally be very difficult...  The next big rivalry will probably involve Doncic"
"Honestly I just want a crowd full of Trae Young mask wearing fans booing for 45 minutes, except when Ben misses his free throws."
Lmao did this guy miss the part where Ben passed up an open dunk because Trae young was on the other side of the rim.
"He also won't back down from a challenge. Ben got intimidated by the defensive presence of Trae Young, Draymond will go straight at the opposing center and kick him in the nuts"
Don't you mean defensive legend Trae Young??
You've seen what he did to Rey Mysterio.  Simmons was right to avoid Trae Young.
Trae Young Socialite
"They will absolutely fine him, but that doesn't help his trade value. I think they should fine him because he doesn't have any trade value.  The man is 6'10 and passed out of a layup that Trae the GOAT Young was pretending to defend"
"I do have the same energy for every guy you named. I'm a player guy above team guy.  If it's not working with the team you're in and you feel like there is something brighter somewhere else then go.  I've seen time and time again players staying ""loyal"" to a team just to get buttfuck in the end or just waste time and accomplish nothing. All the guys you named i've seen either more success or reach higher goals/potential with the change they made. I guess they were right all along uh?  &gt;Would you not do the same if a guy you're paying $180m has to be taken out in the 4th because he's too much of an offensive liability and is afraid to dunk on Trae Young?  Sure, i would but once it happens and the player actually decide to not play don't pikachu.jpeg him"
Trae Young is a menace to society
Imo I don't think so. Trae young shot 39% and 32% from 3 that series.  Cj McCollum would get eaten base off the switches the hawks do. Their front court is 6'9 plus and their guard is 6'8. He did his part but somehow Tobias Harris shooting 38% game 7 and below 30% game 5 at home. Embid did great but 8tos in a crucial win or go home hurts too.
"&gt;Once y'all got eliminated fans screamed on top of every rooftops to never see Ben play another minute with the 76ers  Would you not do the same if a guy you're paying $180m has to be taken out in the 4th because he's too much of an offensive liability and is afraid to dunk on Trae Young?  &gt;There is 0 shit talk it is what it is.  You and I have very different definitions of shit talk lmao  &gt;Difference is his teammate came out and supported him instantly while the popular thing to do was to shit on him.   Difference is PG wants to be better, Ben just wants to be rich and famous.  &gt;Im not talking during the bubble but AFTER when he already shat the bed. Your team didn't do that  Our team did it after every bad performance for 4 years. They did it every time Ben refused to improve his game. They did it when he didn't deserve it. They did it when he wouldn't do the same for them.  Do you have this same energy towards Jimmy Butler and Minnesota? Do you have it towards Harden and Houston? KD and OKC? Kawhi and San Antonio? AD and NOLA? Kyrie and Boston? All these dudes quit on their teams and none of those cities had much, if any, love for them at the end of their tenure. I would someone from the Clippers but dudes seem to be ok being mediocre when they get to chill in LA lmao"
So what? Ben was too scared to even attempt a goddamn layup over Trae Young. Trae is one of the worst defenders in the league and he’s a foot shorter than Ben.  Dude is an all star caliber player who is literally afraid to shoot the basketball. It doesn’t get more pathetic than that.
"Embid can't guard 1-5.  You need someone who can guard them and come off switches .  Who does embid have to guard at his position on a nightly basis in his conference. Clint capella just catches lobs, bam has no jumper, Celtics, wizards, nets no serious threat down low. Brook Lopez is outside the paint spacing for giannas.  Nerlen Noel's is a defensive player.   Verse simmons having to pick up. Trae young, westbrook, kyrie or James harden,  Jimmy butler, Tatum, . All with different skills sets ? A.d. was basically a glorified kevin love with the pelicans. Always hurt and your team can never win."
"&gt; Some say he's a multiple time All-Star and DPOY-tier player who just turned 25 and can get away with whatever he wants. Others say that he's not worth any All-Star player in trade return, let alone a young one.  All we know is, he won't dunk on Trae!"
"Simmons is a legit regular season star.   But in the playoffs Simmons shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Embiid. It's not like Simmons is locking up Trae Young or Durant.   IMO CJ is an upgrade over Simmons in the playoffs quite easily. A healthy prime Embiid with spacing is one of the best bigs ever, albeit that prime won't last long. 76ers beat the hawks if you swap Ben and CJ last year and maybe go to the finals."
Scared money don't make none. Unless you're Ben Simmons and you're scared of Trae Young.
Trae Young has GOAT potential.  That is not to say that there is a large chance of it happening. It is probably less than 0.1%. Also there are valid concerns of his defense becoming an acceptable level.  But I see this term thrown around often for Luka and find it difficult to not also classify Trae as such since both of them have been elite since entering the league
"Jayson Tatum is one of the most overrated players here. He's done nothing to separate himself from young guys like Trae, Book, and Mitchell yet ppl act like he's on a completely different tier. Only young player who's on a tier by himself is Luka"
"These people are all fucking idiots.  Ben Simmons didn't cause Joel Embiid to play like shit in multiple second halfs in that series. Ben Simmons didn't cause Doc Rivers to become the shittiest coach in the league. Ben Simmons didn't set fire to Trae Young.  It's become a meme at this point. Philly fans are happy to play along, because it lets them absolve their savior Joel of any blame, and the organization is happy to play along because then none of them have any consequences.  It's such a joke, and Philly is such a toxic team."
"I think they like to do it to the ""Sloop John B"" tune in England  So it could be ""Can't dunk on Trae Young, can't dunk on Trae YOUNGGGG, BEN SIMMONS, can't dunk on Trae Young!"""
Cmon known rim protector trae young was there
"Which makes it all the more puzzling how a head coach and well regarded staff put Danny Green on Trae Young in game 1, couldn't punish a backcourt of Trae and Lou Will defensively, and decided to run out all bench lineups that never worked all year. How are you so good at your job but still chose a lineup of Dwight, Matisse, and George Hill in a game 7?"
"Scarier situation: getting boo’d by your own fans at training camp, or attempting a dunk over Trae Young in a playoff game?"
"Trae Young still scored close to 30 a night.  I think the Sixers would have traded a little less defense for a point guard that could actually run the offense and wasn’t afraid of the basketball in the fourth quarter.  As a Max player, scoring 5 points in 3 straight playoff games is compete unacceptable even if you play defense.  Dude was completely exposed, and he really was by far the biggest reason they lost that series."
Didn't he try to trip Trae Young last season?
I don't think it's a big deal. I've got a teal Morant and a black Trae Young jersey. I'm a Jazz fan but I also just love hoops so I'll rep players with game styles that I like.
Ah no wonder trae young is killing it.. you got to be scrawny
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/.

"I’d like to formally apologize for calling Trae young the best playmaker in the league, he’s close but Chris Paul still owns that one"
I’d like to see the stats on Trae young
Steph Curry in 2012-2013  Trae Young last season
Trae Young last year
Trae young
I watched Trae young and he’s terrible defensively   Collins and capela was getting easy lobs off him
"just got out of the game, didn’t see any cameras :(  can confirm there were Fuck Trae Young chants outside after the game"
Something we can all agree. Well that and Trae Young looking like some dude's genitalia
No anyone who knows ball can see a 6'11 lock down that can keep up with any opponents point guard.   Second trae young team being more talented doesn't mean anything without someone orchestrating it. The lakers are the most talented but look lost without lebron None of those guys on the hawks are all stars. Porzingis was one before getting his role diminished and could sneak in this year.   The rockets were a bunch of shooting role players and harden managed to make it work... hence why I said luka is closer to westbrook then harden since his style of ball doesn't win anything.
"Time will tell who's better?  Trae young just came off a conference finals battle with the nba Champs while luka couldn't win a home game against a team he verse two years in a row. I'm calling who's better as of right now. I can't predict the future.   Simmons didn't run from any moment. There was 3mintues left in the game after his iconic play. Embid got a turnover right after.  No blame ? The team was up by -&gt;&gt;&gt;25&lt;&lt;&lt;- gm7 before he had to sub back in. No blame?   Only casual fans would think the third option on a team, who played his role should be held accountable and not Tobias Harris who wanted to be an all star shot below 40% in critical gm5 and 7 at home"
"Y’all think points is everything and that’s crazy. Trae young is arguably the worst defensive pg in the league sitting in the 10th seed but y’all wanna glamorize him cos his stats look good. Give me a break, Chris Paul could take the Suns to the finals again and I’m still gonna hear this shit there’s no winning wit some y’all. You stat nerds are different"
Shhhh. Most casual nba fans are D riders. They will say kobe is a ball hog but he avg 5 assist a game in his prime.   They will say Ben simmons is trash but he's a 3 year consecutive all star.   They will say Luka has no help but he chooses to have the highest usage rate. While harden did both and won. Luka is closer to westbrook than to harden. Guess the honey moon phase is still going on.  Trae young is better
Trae young easily
"Davidson Steph would go top 5. He was insanely small, he would get the same treatment Trae Young got with questions coming in how his game would translate on both ends of the court."
"Based on what, assist numbers? You're just one of those nephews that Trae Young described: ""Steph's the best shooter of all time, but I think he's overall just a playmaker"".   Meanwhile CP3 is getting high assist numbers just from passing up to a guy curling around a screen. That's not shot creation, that's just getting free assists from high ball usage. Curry doesn't have anywhere near enough ball usage to get to 10 assists consistently."
At this point literally none. Got Clint for dirt cheap. Paid a good bit for Hunter but he’s good (except injuries :( ). For context he was traded for the picks that became NAW and Jaxson Hayes.    Obviously ppl will say “oh but what about Luka 🤓 “ nah no regrets with that trade. We can talk about hypotheticals all we want but the FACT is Trae has led his team further and we got a promising young wing jn Cam.
"I’m not sure why you think embiid, lebron, pg have all been better than Trae young"
"I'm actually a Mavericks fan! I fully think Luka is a better player than Trae Young, but I think that Luka has not played nearly up to his standards this year.   I expect him to end the year better than Trae, but he has not been up to par so far. He's turning the ball over more than Trae and scoring less efficiently.   I'm sure that'll change, but for now, I do have Trae over Luka!"
Trae Young over Luka should be a punishable crime.
Unless Luka vs Trae both become top 10 oat then no  Also Magic and Bird defined a whole decade by themselves. With all the young talent in the league there’s no way Luka and Trae will have that death grip
"Obviously Trae Young had a better rookie season, but a big reason a lot of those negative comments were made was because Luka was all-NBA level right out of the gate.  Trae and KPJ shouldn't be compared IMO, even though I know what you're saying. It's very unlikely KPJ ever reaches Trae's current level.   Not even a knock on KPJ, just wanted to reply to your comment. Maybe I'm just really high on Trae."
“Faked”   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop  You’d have to have a learning disability to give the guy with a track record of intentionally tripping people a pass on tripping someone.
You are talking about that time where hawk fans and trae young faked that he tripped trae? Yeah no one cares
Trae Young closing the gap
"I don't care about uncontested rebounds at all  Booker and Trae Young have been much better than Luka if you ignore the rebounds  When you evaluate guards just ignore the defensive rebound stat for the most part because they rarely if ever get the hard ones  For example for us Harden is averaging a lot of rebounds but they've done nothing at all to solve our overall rebounding problems, bigs do the actual dirty work"
Booker or Trae Young
&gt;He hasn’t had any antics or whatever since his rookie year  This is straight up false. He literally went after Trae Young’s ankles last season.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop
"&gt; Telling the smallest guy to be the primary playmaker seems more of a relic of the past to me, in the sense that the smaller guy historically would have had to compensate for being small to make it to the league cuz he couldn’t just throw his weight around, and thus just HAPPENED to be the best passer, rather than most naturally suited to the task.  Nah, I think there are still advantages to being a small, fast guy with a tight handle. It's just easier to use screens and move around the court.  Jokic himself is the screener in a ton of actions. Giannis too.  We saw in the Phoenix series that we aren't a true threat without a Jamal-tier PnR playmaker, and we have Trae Young as a sort of next-gen small playmaker."
"Trae Young was not vastly superior to Ben Simmons when Ben got the all-star nod. People hating because of how bad he was in the playoffs, but Ben is an all-star when he's on his game."
Lamelo if he grows into a superstar will have people doing circus shots/ passes saying his name.   You got to be a superstar to get your own adjective. No one can predict the future. I see stars but not  generational legend superstars yet from anyone in the 18-21 drafts.   Actually trae young-&gt;  Ice trae. Hit a cold game winner. Ice trae will pick up steam once he wins an mvp
"Uh, Trae Young as a rookie averaged 19/8 with something like 54%True shooting.  KPJ is on 13/6 with a 46%TS (lmao his TS% is worse than most guards' normal shooting%). This is his third season. Trae was supposed to be a ""good stats bad team"" player, but KPJ has bad stats on a bad team. Any half decent point guard in the NBA could get 6 assists if you allowed them to rack up 4 turnovers every game.  This is not to say KPJ will never be good, but comparing him to Trae Young is silly. He has never put together a stretch of basketball close to Trae's first season (and let's be honest Trae was better early in the season before he ran out of steam)"
"this makes heaps of sense, you basically just have a second team that you're a little more invested in than someone would normally be in their second team because they're in your city haha.   I'm sixers but didn't follow basketball closely until the olympics, I rewatched the playoff series between sixers and atlanta last year though cause I wanted to get up to scratch and came out of that hating Trae Young. However the more i learn about him the more I like him, he just seems like a really good person. I'm sure I'll hate him again after saturday though haha"
"Incredibly similar to all the rookie year Trae Young comments where a young player is playing a tough position on a very weak team and we’re expected to believe they won’t reach their potential. Same criticisms - bad defence, bad turnovers, bad shooting %.  So if that’s the metric we’re going by then I’m sure KPJ will be an All-Star in no time."
Trae young still ain’t good in dyckman
Fuck Trae Young though.
Trae Young!
"I don’t see it. The lack of a shot creator that isn’t better overall as a player than Klay isn’t even making the playoffs.   Dame has only made the conference finals once and he’s definitely a better player than Klay because he can score at all 3 levels and create his own shot. He’s arguably the “worst” first option to have made the WCF in recent years. Trae Young in the East made WCF, he’s also probably better than Klay similarly to Dame in that he creates a lot more points and scores at 3 levels.  You either need at least 2 or all 3 of elite scoring, playmaking, and defending in order to be a first option. Klay isn’t an elite scorer due to his inability to self-create, and he’s a a very good defender but not a complete lockdown type of dude(Kawhi, AD, Giannis, even LeBron type). For reference - AD, who in his NO days was definitely a better player than Klay, only made the playoffs twice as the #1 dude and lost both times to the Warriors."
I would 100% take Trae Young over D Book.
"Also a lot of the criticism against Curry coming out of college were legitimate, same with Trae Young. They just proved to be the rare exceptions to the rule. Most guards under 6'5 who arent athletic just aren't worth a lottery pick."
i agree judging on the number of titles is stupid. but you have to acknowledge that last years was one of the weakest of all time. there were 6 all star level players that essentially missed it. kyrie/harden/davis/kawhi/jamal murray. Then embiid and lebron were banged up pretty heavily and then trae young also got hurt. like it was just an unprecedented amount of injuries.
*sad fuck trae young noises*
Harden shoots better when he’s not being unnatural too. I think for Trae it could just be he’s young and improving though
"Yes, Hawks were a Trae Young ankle away from potentially facing us in the finals after a tremendous run (I still had the Bucks winning either way). The Bulls have 2 26PPG scorers, outstanding defense, and once the rest of their offense gels, look out. These are legit teams."
"Defense isn’t sexy , &amp; like draymond said alot of ppl don’t understand what they’re seeing or really understand defense , so to alot of ppl that might be boring but I came up watching soccer where games would finish 0-0 so I like it personally, bc every basket count , where as today you can come back from down 20 in 5 min (ie like trae young did Philly in the playoff last year ) , which isn’t Appealing to me , I get bored quick watching games today bc they’ll have 100 points by the 3rd qtr , it feels watered down and the avg are highly inflated bc of the fast pace of todays game , I love defense so maybe I’m biased in that way"
Because Trae Young exists Baaaaabby!
"I've seen two people say ""he can't be worse than Trae"" in this thread like it's anywhere close to promising that he is being compared to Trae fucking Young on DEFENSE."
"Yes, this, I know exactly what the Lakers and Warriors are up to every week and I'm not even a fan.  I think everyone at this point loves watching Curry shoot and Lebron with bad teammates.   I loved the sheer volume and schedule of games in the Bubble Tournament, it was like March Madness Pro, but this season has been more entertaining in some ways. Lakers rollercoaster, Warriors winning, Lazy Luka, Young Cavs, pesky Wiz, Struggling Nets with sublime Durant, Ja, Trae, Jokic, Suns Scorching, Giannis yah.   There's something to see every night. The youth movement has the league feeling like the 90s again, potential is in the air, the 'Next Jordan' energy is off the charts."
Trae Young and IT feasted in the paint. AI would be gucci.
"now imagine doing that in a playoff game except the player is french, has been in the league for 4 years, and the player he’s guarding is Trae Young."
Couldn't be any worse than Trae Young is and Traes defense only moderately hurts the Hawks. AI would be an absolute fucking killer in the modern league.
Bruh Knicks fans fucking *love* Trae Young. It's just more fun this way.
"&gt;because of a lack of explosiveness (meaning he will be a huge defensive liability)  a little confused on this point... did they think he wouldn't be able to stay in front of his man or something?  did he turn out to be more explosive than expected (aside from bulking up)?  steph and dlo are actually good at defense this year.  I'm wondering if there's hope for trae young.  his bbiq is high, and physically according to the combine results his wingspan is just .5in less than steph's...."
"I thought it meant the #2 greatest post defender behind Trae Young, Chris Chiozza was in?"
"Trae Young, the owner of MSG and *true* owner of NY, would like a word."
Unless it’s trae young
"&gt; trae young and cp3 tried doggystyling their defenders which was rightly enforced differently this year  it's so painful to have to repeat this over and over on a subreddit dedicated to the NBA, but being able to beat a defender around a screen, and then stop on a dime to take a shot and force him to run into you is ATHLETIC SKILL. it should NOT be ruled against as a foul, because if a defender is so clumsy that he runs into a player, he shouldn't be letting the player beat him in the first place."
Jimmy is the worst to me because he's what people stereotype guys like Harden/Embiid/Trae Young as but actually(an unskilled scorer who gets points because of free throws)  No jumper and no bag at all but just free throws and gets no hate lol
"Ya, I'm not saying he's moving slow, just that it's slower relative to guys like Trae Young, and Dame Lillard."
"Which if your defender is out of position, is a perfectly legal and demoralizing way to exploit a defenders poor positioning/footwork. Unless you’re throwing elbows or trying to imitate marshawn lynch, initiating strong contact as the offensive player has and always will be a smart move. Harden did it with his arm hooking and euro undercutting and trae young and cp3 tried doggystyling their defenders which was rightly enforced differently this year"
"Kevin Durant is ranked 15th all time in FT%. He averages more free throws per game than anyone inside the top 40 for FT% (Trae Young currently averages the same attempts at #42 in FT%).   Basically, consistency is hard. Only 14 people shoot better than him in all history and all of them have taken much fewer shots than he has. It's so hard to be a 90%+ FT shooter and almost impossible on high volume (no one has ever done it on his volume)"
"all i know is Trae Young better be a lock this year. last year was truly some bullshit, this year there is no excuse. also John Collins should be highly considered to be a reserve."
idk i dont watch many hawks games but booker almost missed no games for all the 2021 season while trae young seemed to mess his anke very often and missed like 3 playoff games cuz he stepped on the refs foot
"People go after guys like Trae Young or James Harden, but Embiid and Butler have the softest whistle in the league and have had it for year."
Trae Young.
"Except I don't recall the Knicks ever ""exploiting"" Trae on defense, only moments i can recall is hitting Kanter on the catch and shoot a couple times but that was about it. It was an altogether ugly game after about late in the 2nd quarter. Really, Reggie is excellent for matching up against guys like Bogi and Cam but they both went out early.   It was just an ugly, weird game. Nobody but Burks and Trae got anything going. Kudos to your young guy Sims though, dude's a beast. Reminds me of Jaxson Hayes, but bigger. He can jump out of the gym."
"Y'all don't understand Ayton wants Trae Young and Luka money. He deserves the bag, but not superstar max which is what his camp wants."
"He's going to be 37 in a few weeks, short of acquiring a Luka Doncic, Devin Booker or a Trae Young, he's done winning championships if they can't turn it around this season.  They've backed themselves into a wall with a poorly assembled roster so unless he's willing to go a place like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas or Phoenix where he can be more of the Robin to someone else's Batman, I think he's done."
"The Knicks were running the hawks off the 3 point line or contesting all their threes the whole night, great overall effort by them. Trae young had about 4 of those long ball threes which you just have to live with."
Is it safe to bring a Trae Young jersey to MSG?

TRAE YOUNG LOOKS LIKE MY DAD’S DICK  I - I - I’VE NEVER SEEN MY DAD’S DICK  BUT HE STILL LOOKS LIKE SHIT
Trae young due to playmaking
"Booker is a 2 guard  and has a completely different style of play than trae, both are effective and can give anyone around them a chance to win. Can talk all day about stats but they're young elite talents who play the game and are winning for the first time in their careers. Just happy for them."
Put Trae Young on the Suns instead of Devin Booker and they are a worse team.  Put Devin Booker on the Hawks instead of Trae young and they are a worse team.
"Trae young easily. This is like comparing Steve Nash to…Ray Allen. Both are very good but 1 guy makes others better and you can build off him and win. The other guy…he just gon get you buckets.   JUST buckets, unless you’re a freak athlete or just doing it at an all time level, is only going to go but so far. It’s the reason why the SG position is probably weakest from an all-time POV. After Jordan and Kobe there’s a significant drop off. It’s just hard to have an impact as a SG without considerable size.   And Booker ain’t Kobe or Jordan (smh @ the Kobe comps), he’s not a freak athlete, not a defender, he nice but he’s like prime Ray Allen, he can score but he’s not built to be the best player on a team. Trae can be tho, especially in today’s game"
"rich, coming from a trae young fan"
"Knicks young core shined tonight.  The intensity and energy they bring to the court is amazing.  For all the ‘Fuck Trae Young’ chants, I’m with it but the guy is a certified bucket and a superstar.  Great game, looking forward to the game at the Garden."
DON'T LET ME CATCH TRAE YOUNG IN DYCKMAN
But quickley and grimes did. Sonned Trae young who was missing in the fourth
"Knicks won and still hit Trae Young Over 30 and Over 4.5 Threes, best possible outcome. Just bet props on guys who usually kill us lol."
#IS TRAE YOUNG VALID????
Rather him than Trae Young
Trae young has two new fathers - Quentin grimes and immanuel quickley.  IQ spanked him in the fourth
[IS TRAE YOUNG VALID?](https://twitter.com/BeezyXVI/status/1400507068289896454?t=B_lbdFf23FQXo-TwVATsjQ&amp;s=19)
Trae young still is your dad tho.
FUCK TRAE YOUNG BING BONG BITCH
Trae young is a first ballot hall of fame ugly dude and is NOT valid in Dyckman
We will see what you guys say if we win in NY then.    Probably still “Fuck Trae Young” lol looking forward to it
"Man, watching Trae young be allowed to just sit in the corner on defense every playoff game against us made me so annoyed. Glad we can change that now  **BING BONG**"
Trae Young throwing his neck back constantly like he’s an OF model. You ain’t valid.
#BING BONG FUCK TRAE YOUNG KNICKS ARE GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL
IS TRAE YOUNG VALID???????
IS TRAE YOUNG VALID?
We deserve the shit that will be slang towards us after this game. Gg Knicks and can’t wait for the “fuck Trae young” chants on Christmas. Hope we’re both fully healthy for it
Trae Young mad. No ice today
Trae Young foul baiting like a mf
Plot Remix: Nash quits as head coach and comes back to play for BK. BK trades Kyrie for Trae. All this so that Nash could mentor Trae and let him know “he’s not mad at him young king”
You did not just compare trae young to d rose.... Their games and situation are nothing alike
Pain.   Fuck Trae Young.
"Let's try this again...  RemindMe! 2 years ""Is Trae Young a Top 2 Offensive Player?"""
Trae Young &gt; Steph Curry
Reminds me of Cliques videos where some random ass dude like Trae Young wins 6MOY
derrick white or trae young
I had him and Trae Young last year... It was a good year til it wasn't
"Trae Young gets superstar hate around here, it's weird. With how much hate he gets you'd think he really was better than Steph Curry."
"John Collins basically threw him under the bus, Collins also denied an extension to look for the max. Collins also says he wants the ball more. This was all public, Trae isn't wrong in any of this and anybody surprised he is struggling. This isn't the type of stuff you say publicly.  Trae has a clear goal to be a bigger threat scoring hence he tried to cheese calls, he was prepared because the past two years he's been completely running the offense on himself his team has been bad at turnovers and creating their own shot. He is still top 5 playmaker in the league.  Frankly it's common sense to me, I highly doubt Trae young doesn't want to pass the ball just because he's too good at it and it's been pretty fucking easy for him. I just think he tried to be more aggressive because his team sucks but at the end of the day he will still p ass the ball, hes waay too smart not to."

"Idk if you been watching OKC, but Dort goes crazy   Trae Young is obviously the better player, but fit matters at the highest levels too. So it isn't a given that it's trae (for a team with a great offense and bad defense)"
"But it wasn’t going to last. Young players get on hot streaks. Collins point was that if the offense relies on Trae 100%, they will lose when he’s even 90%. That’s why you have teammates in the NBA.  Remember the last team to win a ring because they funneled all their plays through one guy? No? Because it doesn’t happen. Lebron always had a great #2 option. The Warriors have great passing and look for open shooters. The raptors ran through kawhi but Lowry and siakam got their own with ibaka, green, gasol, FVV and norm chipping in. The heatles, the Spurs, Kobe/Pau lakers, etc.  One man shows DONT win."
"Trae Young is shooting near his rookie season efficiency on a similar number of shot attempts. I don't wanna sound harsh but if he's pouting about ceding control when his supporting cast is barely playoff caliber. he looks set to be a career ""bad teams, big numbers"" guy."
Trae Young is paid nearly half the salary of Jordan Clarkson. Would you really pass up trading Clarkson for Trae + 5M freed up salary to spend on whatever you want for Dort?
"I'm not sure I agree even for the lakers.   Trae Young costs less than Montrez. He costs less than Kuzma + Wesley Mathews. If I were a GM, I would chose losing Kuzma + Mathews for Trae 10/10 times over Dort even if Dort was free."
"They're gonna need a lot more out of Trae Young and John Collins as well, but getting those guys back will definitely help."
"Yep  I'd rather have Dort on the Jazz than Trae Young right now. With Conley and Mitchell both playing well and already undersized, give me Dort to throw out there with those two, Bojan, and Gobert any day of the week  Plus Trae really needs the ball in his hands to be effective which again would clash with both Mitchell and Conley. The PNR with Gobert would be really nasty though"
trae young is lowkey trash. id probably beat him 1 on 1 just because im a postup god and hes a smallfry
LOL Trae Young vs Dort is not Giannis vs Herro come on now
Tell that to the people who were saying Trae Young was the MVP frontrunner and that the Hawks had won the Doncic trade after 5 games.
"r/nba is a tale of two cities. On one hand, you get some decent basketball evaluation and threads like the Draymond Green play-breakdown. And on the other, there's this.  If this is somehow unironic, every single possible metric tells you that Trae Young is much much more valuable. Even when he's playing like an absolute bum so far in this small sample size, he STILL has a higher RAPTOR and WAR than Dort. And last year, it wasn't even close. Trae Young is a top 25-30 player with an All-NBA ceiling. Dort will be a fantastic role-player/defensive specialist/3rd-4th option on a good team. Maybe even a part-time all-star if everything plays out in his favor.  Trae Young is so much more impactful. The discussion we're having here is like comparing Tyler Herro to Giannis. I love Herro, but this is comical."
Trae Young because the media nuts every time he had a highlight like he’s a superstar but the dude will never be “the guy” on a good team. Also Kyle Kuzma.
"Not to discredit Trae Young or anything, but Lou Dort on a team like the Nets would be better than having Trae"
Trae Young no question
"Trae Young obviously.. Is this a ""joke""?"
I was thinking about this but out of all the young PGs in the league I think I like him the most after Luka. He got the shooting over Ja and Simmons and the defense over Trae. This dude better make an all star this year I think he’s a more impactful player than Booker.
"Trae Young - his wacky ass hair  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist - I used to always draft this guy in fanasty draft in 2k14 and he sucked. Also he was picked 4th in his draft class how isn't he cyberbullied more  Khris Middleton - So underrated he's overrated and I hate it for some reason.  On a totally seperate note I just hate watching the Celtics. I don't know if it's their offense, or lack of an inside presence, but I just get bored watching them. It's probably their jersey's, as iconic as they are."
"They massacred my boy.  Trae ""Will be an MVP before Luka"" Young"
is Trae Young pouting cuz his teammates told him to pass more and play within the offense?
Someone please put out a BOLO for Trae Young! Please!
"Trae ""Better than Steph Curry"" Young brought the heat tonight"
"We need a new coach.   Besides individual improvement of Trae Young and John Collins there is no improvement on the team.   To be quite honest I really don't know how of Trae's improvement was on Lloyd Pierce or if it is pure talent from Trae.  Unless they make the playoffs, Lloyd Pierce is gone."
"If that's what he is doing, that's a complete bitch move. Seriously, I don't care how much you don't like a coach, you communicate the issues in order to win.   LP isn't a great coach but he certainly isn't bad enough to warrant Trae Young not buying in to get him fired.   I hope that's not what he's doing. I'm sure it's not but if it is I lost a lot of respect for my guy."
I can't even think of an apt package for a guy like Trae Young
"Trae ""better than Steph curry"" young"
Wtf is happening to Trae young for the last couple of games?
Steve nash gave Trae young depression
I just want Trae Young back... he's not injured or anything just playing like shit. Hard to win games when you hit a grand total of 5 3's with just 2 people managing to make a 3.
Send a god damn Amber Alert for Trae Young.
Trae Young has gone completely missing.
Trae Young stats since the Pope got a Hawks jersey?
Is Trae Young hurt? How the fuck does he only have 4 points
"Trae Young changed his game more than anyone to adapt to playing like Nash. He also bore the brunt of Nash's frustrations during his Hawks tenure with indirect jabs about free throw baiting involving Young.          For fuck's sake, Trae Young literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of comments from Steve Nash.      Despite all that Nash to the very end never seemed to appreciate what Young meant to him. When he signed with the Nets,Young found out from a notification and HE called Nash to tell him he loved him.      Man, I just really admire Trae Young and his strength and big heart in the face of what he puts up with."
Did steve nash give trae young depression?
trae young still butt
Trae Young because he’s Trae Young
Trae Young sucks lately. What's his problem.
What is Trae Young doing out there? Still pouting like a bitch?
i think the ideal teammate for Giannis is Trae Young. takes the ball and offensive load out of Giannis's hands.. Giannis can still Giannis
Trae young is an infinitely better #2 for Embiid than a power forward that can't shoot outside of 3ft from the rim that is mascarading as a guard. It's like you people don't actually watch playoff basketball and consume so much regular season ball that you assume every possession is a fast break so why wouldn't someone want Simmons over a player with a much larger offensive toolbox when Simmons can still give you 15 a game with elite defense.
Trae young is actually much better though
Trae Young is a great player but the way that this subreddit looks at players it doesn't seem like being a defense or passing matters anymore.
"The amount of hype he got going into college and the draft was like LeBron level. It’s not weird that he didn’t live up to that, few players do. I think what feeds into the Simmons hate is the fact that other guys were taken after him (both in that draft and in subsequent drafts) who have added to their games offensively and become 20+ ppg scorers while Simmons has appeared relatively stagnant to casual watchers. Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, Trae Young, Ja Morant, the list goes on. Would I rather have any of those guys? Maybe some of them. It’s probably too early to tell, but if Simmons gets traded away, the Sixers will be quantitatively worse in a lot of ways and people will see his true value."
Of course the Catholic Church is a fan of Trae *Young*.
Sure but its basically flopping. Its annoying to watch in the same way watching Trae Young twerk into his opponents is.
"My point is, most players on 3 point fouls dont “flop”. Theyre either protecting their ankles or embellshing contact that already happened. They are not faking contact out of nothing for the sake of a foul.  I just hate the double standards on this sub. For someone like Curry people will argue it’s him protecting his ankles, but for someone like Harden or Trae Young they’ll argue they’re flopping bitches."
"On a talent level Kyrie is definitely on par with Dillard. I'd put him above Butler and Mitchell without a second thought.   The fact that you listed fucking Rudy Gobert, CP3, and Trae Young says all I need to know about how valuable this conversation is going to be."
"Trae Young also has a low release,I think it only looks awkward because he is taller ."
"Jesus I can just imagine the shit hawks fans would write if trae young opened a restaurant in Atlanta and left. We have the oddest fan base in the nba. They’d probably write some of the wall shit. *Trae young sexually assaulted my auntie*, *the waiter ate my pussy without a condom,* *i found a dildo in my refried beans*, *my fries were cold.*"
Trae Young has entered the chat
"I agree with most of your argument especially with more bigs being projects and guards having a higher floor. But wanted to add for the high level guard play argument that you alluded to is that the key is the older college guards are the ones that hit the ground running at a high level usually...the guys coming in after 3-4 years of college (Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, etc.).   But of the guys coming in at a younger age the only one I really remember playing at a high level in recent memory is Trae Young. We saw good prospects like D-Lo, Lonzo, Fox, etc. really struggle to adapt in their first few years in the NBA before becoming solid players"
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
This literally already happened like a week ago with Trae Young lmao
What about the guy who said trae young is better than curry? Or the one who said Curry's contract is untradeable?
"You’re getting raped when he’s on the floor, and last year was barely better.  All impact metrics show him as a complete negative and he has a 12 PER, again. Which goes to my point about pace and the current league.  Bradley Beal is just causally doing 35 a game efficiently. Trae Young was a 30/10 guy last year.  Our brains have not caught up to just how crazy this era is offensively.   And Herro is like, Aaron Afflalo in this era so far and nothing more. Just a lot hype due to whiteness and Miami, and Jimmy and the playoff run.  To make him the barrier between a true rare talent is insane, and it’ll be known by EVERYOBE by the time the playoffs start and people will look back on the undervaluing of Harden like his missing the All-NBA teams that one year."
"&gt;The Mavs were also perfectly fine without KP when he was missing last year during the regular season.  We're talking about individual performance in relation to the team, right? The Mavs are not improved if their second best player is not there, whereas he was there for the last season at the start.  You also didn't touch up on the fact that Young has regressed a lot more, where as Doncic's offensive numbers have barely come down aside from his 3 and his defense is extremely improved.  You also didn't speak about the difference in stregth of schedule. The Hawks loss streak was against the Hornets, Nets, Cavs, Knicks, and Hornets, where Trae put up a whopping 18 PPG  while shooting 30 percent from the field."
"1. Trae Young is better offensively for now  2. Luka has improved a lot on defense, I would say that he’s above average and a year away from being All-Defense the way he’s improving"
"A lot of YouTubers will take a controversial player like Trae and kick him while he's down. They knows it's gonna get clicks because a lot of people hate Trae young for stupid reasons like how people compared him to curry despite Trae denying it and how he was traded for Luka the most likeable player in the league even though there both really good players. Add the foul stuff, the fake John and Trae beef, and him encouraging the hawks to win now instead of continuing to rebuild and you get one of the most hated young players in the league as half the league praises him constantly and the other half hates on him constantly. So making a bad video about Trae will get you clicks from saltyhawkfans like me looking to defend him and other people who hate Trae for no reason. Especially with YouTubers like him being more about drama instead of talking about actual basketball there's no surprise he's exaggeratting about how Trae's ""A selfish basketball player""."
"if you look at european soccer, the lack of a draft allows teams like barcelona, man city and real madrid to poach talent. smaller markets in europe will never even dream of getting someone as marketable a zion or a cade cunningham. so you have teams who can buy up all the exciting youth talent, which leaves every other team searching desperately for scraps. getting rid of the draft would have enormous implications for small market teams who relay on lottery picks to turn their franchise around. Without the draft, trae young is not a hawk. zion is not a pelican, donavan mitchell is nowhere near utah. every soild youth prospect will either be a laker, a clipper, a knick or a bull. why would you sign with the charlotte hornets, when the most iconic franchises in the league are offering more or better amenities? do not get rid of the draft. small markets NEED the draft."

Trae Young is 41st?!?!  So did Trae Young get better on defense or are advanced defensive statistics that janky?
Didn't we as a community come to the consensus that the Hawks officially won the trade and that Trae Young is now better than Luka is? Where are we getting best player in the league from here?
"Trae young seems to be on his way to becoming the next James Harden. That's not a bad thing at all. Harden is one of the best offensive superstars this league has ever seen. But he also has 0 rings, yet. It doesn't help Trae depends a lot on getting FT like Harden. Trae will quickly develop a lot of haters. He should consider changing his style. He's still young."
The 2k broadcasters have a line where they say something like Trae Young could go down as the best PG of all time.
Why is Trae Young always brought up like this? Only watched one Hawk game this season so far. Is he that much of a defensive sieve? Like is it really bad IQ or just an astounding lack of effort?
"Ok. Fair play if it's an old story, but it does seem to check out - [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense)"
it clearly means that trae young is the best ~~point guard~~ player of all time pls ignore my flair
"The real question isn't if Luka can be a good defender- he is already absolutely capable of being one when he chooses to. The question is how good does Luka have to be on defense for the narrative that he's a liability to die? I really do believe that if  Luka were to play rock solid fundamental defense along with averaging amazing ""countable"" stats like 2 steals and 3 blocks a game he would STILL be forever made fun of for being a Trae Young level abomination by the sports media and the sheep who follow it."
Suddenly Trae Young gets back to the free throw line numbers prior to Nash calling him out
y’all say that like Kyrie is trae young
Zach Lowe said something to the effect of “Trae Young is like a piece of tissue paper floating around the top of the perimeter”
God the amount of free throw attempts they'll average. And people thought Trae Young was bad
"he was far too ahead of his time. if he had been in the draft after curry had changed the game, he would’ve been in a position like trae young is now"
"This list ain’t it. Curry &gt; doncic, trae young &gt; Simmons, and Westbrook should not be higher than Lowry or even wall"
"They are offering that type of draft compensation because they don’t have players of a high caliber to offer less. Dinwiddie, Levert, filler isn’t worth Ben Simmons which is why they need to add picks to the package. No young team is a James Harden rental away from winning so they aren’t going to mortgage their future for him. For example the Hawks aren’t going to give up every useful player on the roster besides Trae just to have their starting backcourt give up 65 points a night. The rockets can either take filler players and a whole bunch of picks or Ben Simmons + less picks"
"You take the best player and at the moment that’s Luka.   Trae has a chance to have a better career than Luka (because he is an insanely talented young player), however at the moment Luka looks like a future MVP, who has won at every level pre-NBA. Also Luka showed up in the playoffs with a matchup that had Paul George and Kawhi taking turns guarding him.   We won’t know who won the trade for a few more years, but at the moment Luka is the best player and the guy you would prefer to have."
Best player to play for the franchise since hakeem and he brought them closer to the ring than any other team in the West during the warriors run   Averages 30+ points per game and is most likely the best scorer this game has ever seen   But because people don’t like his PlayStyle (which look at trae young has become mainstream) and the fact that the apparently likes to party means that none of that matters and that he sucks
Watson wants out because the Texans are a absolute shit show of a organization and a guy named Bill O Brian who was the GM and fucked the team over. They had Deandre Hopkins who was a top 15 player and the best wide receiver in the league and was the second most valuable player in the Texans and about to enter his prime. They traded him for a washed player on a horrible contract and a mediocre pick  The nba Equivalent of the Hopkins trade would be like Lemarcus Aldridge and the 20th overall pick for Bradley Beal  As for his player comp I’m gonna say Ben Simmons or Trae Young (Top 20 young star)
hope you kept that same energy when trae young and jokic feasted on our team the last two games. This is the NBA 40+ points is impressive regardless especially how much he gets doubled and even at times tonight tripled.
"Curry missed 2 ft's, totally washed lol Trae Young would NEVER"
i don't like us becoming trae young beyond the arc and leaning in for contact on ever jumper either
I still don’t understand the love fest for Trae Young his career shooting splits are 42.7/34.1/85 with some of the worst defense in the league.  I wouldn’t be sure Ayton doesn’t surpass Trae again when we see them in the playoffs.
"Yep the first one was Nash! I just picked the first MVP I thought off with Traes mold and your suns flare made tipped me towards it. Anyways, my argument was never about him becoming an MVP, just an MVP candidate. I don’t think he’ll ever be an MVP but to exclude him from having a candidate-esque season while he’s still so young is pretty close minded. And no two players will ever have the same exact play style and archetype so I’m not gonna try to bring an example for that but like you said, there’s anomalies, like Nash, so why would you say theres no possibility of him being even just a candidate. Trae is not on some sort of hall of fame trajectory yet but he’s certainly not out of the discussion for future MVP candidate."
Nah the east is radically better from 2018. Boston and Milwaukee alone are way ahead of any team from 2018 in the East. Plus the Hawks have a solid core and an all star in Trae Young. That’s basically the 2017 Cavs minus LeBeon.
"More like Trae Young, Harden hasn't been bad at defending for years"
"IMO, Trae Young can't be the best player on a championship team."
"Lamelo's numbers aren't concerning at all, low 40s from the field+low 50s true shooting is pretty standard for rookies in a lead ball handling role. Guys like Trae Young, Collin Sexton, De'Aaron Fox all had numbers in that range their rookie year. Learning how to play against NBA level physicality, draw fouls, and finish against hyper athletic shot blockers comes with time, and struggling at those things initially is just par for the course."
On the other hand it sucks playing 4 rookies and dwight vs Jokic harris Trae Young etc. and taking Ls while we would blow them out with our usual squad.
"&gt; Zach is scoring and defending significantly better than Trae.  There's no doubt about that.  But (and I say this as a Bulls fan who believes LaVine deserves to get that last all-star spot) the difference in playmaking between the two of them is *huge*. Zach is getting incrementally better every year, but Trae is a premier playmaker. 8.6 ast with just 4.1 TO vs 5.2 ast with 4.4 TO. That's a big gap.  Zach is my guy, and I think he's a better overall player, but there's nothing wrong with being honest and admitting that Young is in a totally different category as a playmaker."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"No one is saying that he’s the best player ever. He is just an all star caliber player who has been playing injured. Just last year he was all nba third team above players like Trae Young, Beal, and Lowry.  Also he was better last year than two years ago, so he has not declined for the past three years."
Ppl will never accept that they where wrong about trae young huh?? (Not talking bout your post just some of the comments are making me laugh LMAOO)
Trae Young shouldn't be an all-star this year
"Jimmy Butler gets a huge pass for being a guy that lives at the line and forces contact just to get a foul call. He’s no different than Trae or Harden, and may be worse considering that last year 38% of his points came from the line. At least Harden/Young have the ball in their hands virtually the entire game, so it makes a bit more sense that they get to the line a lot."
"Yeah but now look at what Booker's stats look like on a winning team. Luka showed that he will be putting up these numbers WHILE winning games. And now Trae is beginning to show the same as well.   Booker was obviously a great player, but he's not the game changing talent that some other young guys are at the moment."
Somewhere ahead of Michael Jordan but behind Trae Young
"Lauri shooting 50/40/84 just saying. Collins is better defensively obviously but he is not elite defender either tbh. And also i'm pretty sure playing next to Trae Young in his last 2+ seasons makes things easier for him while Lauri didn't played with elite playmaker in his entire career.  Collins is safe pick but I'm not gonna blame anyone who chooses Lauri. Because of Boylen, thoughts on Lauri highly changed last year undeservely"
Believe it or not Trae young had what gets recorded as a block on Kevin Durant last month also
"Here’s another Fun and Weird Fact:  This season, Trae Young has been most efficient from the three point like on Friday."
There is also a lot of hindsight here.  Luka was by no means the clear cut number 1 pick.   Ayton was and is an athletic freak. He had just come off of a 21 and 12 season on 60+ fg%.  And ayton was considered at worst 1b.  Not every GM was high on Luka.  I mean look at the kings.  They took bagley.  The hawks traded back out of the spot for trae young. Luka is obviously the better player now but it was by no means a slam dunk.  Very much an oden/durant situation where everybody thought both would be transcendent.
The Trae Young special.
Trae young
"Undefeated against the Nuggets for the first several years of his career  We'll see how it goes when he plays us on Atlanta without Prime Harden (although tbh Trae Young has always roasted us, too)"
He does the Trae Young foul baiting with his ass
"That’s the shit that always confused me. Scouts had him as a consensus top 3 pick, potential first pick, he got co-signs from Rico Hines and Trae Young, couple more NBA players but I can’t name them off the top of my head. Like real high-level people were saying he had the talent and yet people would still say it’s just because of his bro or his dad. Or he only that high up because he’s famous. As if NBA scouts would waste a top 3 pick just because a guy has a social media following. It’s like people couldn’t fathom that he was famous but actually talented at the same time."
"he would get downvoted to oblivion because 6-7 months ago, lauri was not in the bubble and he had had a mediocre season, whereas KP was looking like a borderline superstar.   he just came off a meniscus tear, can we be patient. yall are the same ppl who said trae young was a bust istg"
and trae young leads in baiting fouls. shouldn’t you be posting hate about luka?
Trae young and Luka are compared by the media and this sub almost every day 🤡 Now that Luka is doing bad it’s not a fair comparison 😭🤣
"This has gotten ridiculous.  The worst offender are Coby White, Luka, Trae Young and Harden. Those guy stop the ball with their hand underneath ten plus times a game then continuation dribble....that is not a hesitation dribble, that is a travel."
Thanks. Trae Young and John Collins got that plus 40 off the Bulls in game one.
The difference is Trae Young is one of the worse defenders in the nba right and probably the worse defender in the nba that plays over 30 mpg.
Trae would be an outstanding fit on our team:  PG - Trae Young SG - Joe Johnson SF - Dominique Wilkins PF - Bob Pettit C - Dikembe Mutumbo
"Read what I said - Markkanen is better OFFENSIVELY. Markkanen is the better scorer for sure, it's not even debatable based on his career numbers and current season numbers (and shooting splits). Lauri has avgd more assists through his career too. OG also has had competent playmaking guards like Lowry and FVV feed him. If Lauri played with a Trae Young or Lowry, his overall game would be way better too. He also has a much higher upside that OG offensively - 7-footer who shoots the 3 at a high clip on high volume while having decent athleticism for someone that size. OG is the better defender, but I wouldnt immediately say he's the better overall asset. He plays with Lowry, FVV, and Siakam, yet the bulls still have a better record - bulls have had a tougher schedule so far too  The PF/C isnt the most important position in NBA. Primary ballhandling wings/combo forwards like Lebron, Giannis, Kawhi, KD, Tatum run the league undoubtedly."
Those are Trae Young numbers
"Trae ""in another Hawks win"" Young at 59%"
"Dude I'm done with you after you called fucking Jabari Parker a defensive Stalwart. Travis only signed players on EXPIRING CONTRACTS, that wouldn't eat at our cap space or require us to cut any of our young core. You expected him to do something stupid like signing Al Horford to a 4 year extension and letting Reddish walk because he had a rough rookie year? They cannot run a offense with Trae and Collins, you have to be a moron or a manchild laughing to himself over this weak troll attempt. What has Luka accomplished other than losing out of the first round? We're handing out participation trophies, I can gloat how Luka's team is 11th place and most likely gonna miss the playoffs if they don't make a trade soon while Trae's is in 6 and only has the Cavs, Magic, Heat, and Knicks to worry about. Gallo been more productive than a 7'3 big that gets murked by Cousins."
Maybe trae young too
"While I like trae young more than jimmy the way they go about getting to the line is very different, jimmy attacks hard to the rim a lot so a lot of his fouls are more clean than trae’s"
Trae Young made it last year
Trae young was a starter last year on a terrible team.
"Ja looked like he had “it” as much as a rookie can last year, I think he’s got just as good of a shot of being a perennial all star as any young player not named Luka or Trae. MVP is a bit harder to predict, but I also wouldn’t say he for sure will never reach those heights."
Hawks fans told me Trae Young was better
For real. Its tough out there. Trae Young opted to sprinkle bird seed on his head and let the pigeons in ATL build a nest on his head. Gotta do what you gotta do in these trying times
"And not only that, both players are really young. In particular trae is bound to have rough patches because of the 3, just look at steph, even he has bad streches but by the end of the season he always has good numbers. People expect these young dudes to be lebron and always have good records, not even jordan was able to do what lebron did but guys are constantly being compared to lebron ability to carry teams. Doncic started off but he has steadelly improved despite his teammates not being up to par. The season is long and i believe in this team.   This is a vivious cicle though, their young players were criticized before so people do the same to other franchieses. What we fail to realize is that most teams are pretty happy with their young dudes."
You mocking that Trae young or Dort post from earlier right lmaoo
Trae Young and Tyler Herro are probably better comparison since I know a bunch of people were acting like Herro was the better shooter  last season because of a higher 3pt%.  &amp;#x200B;  Call me bias cause I probably am but if you actually watch the shots Trae takes and regularly makes compared to the shots Herro is getting its night and day whose better.
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.       These players should all make it before him for the final team:  |East|Pos|Team| :--|:--|:--| |Kyrie Irving|G|BRK|.   |Bradley Beal|G|WAS| |Kevin Durant|F|BRK| |Joel Embiid|F|PHI| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|MIL| |Trae Young|G|ATL| |James Harden|G|BRK| |Jayson Tatum|F|BOS| |Khris Middleton|F|MIL| |Domantans Sabonis|F|IND| |Zach LaVine|WC|CHI| |Jaylen Brown|WC|BOS|.        That's not even including other contenders like Bam, Vic, Randle, Hayward, Tobi, Brogdon and Sexton."
"Why is Trae Young on this list? He's still putting up crazy number on a winning team. Check the sidebar lol  Lavine, KAT, and Beal havent had many chances at real teams.  Kemba's problem isnt the lack of winning ball, it's his knees"
You have trae young and harden kicking their legs out to 90 degrees and that's the followthrough foul they call
Why is Trae Young on this list?
Serious question that is not meant to attack Jimmy at all. Why is Jimmy almost unanimously liked despite him being a huge foul drawer while Trae Young seems to be getting an exorbitant amount of hate for his play this season?
Someone who calls Trae Young a superstar telling other people they are overestimating their favorite players.
"If it was actually based on merit, then yes. But CooCoo ass Kyrie will get in over him. Fuck they’ll probably put Trae Young over Jaylen because he nutmegs dudes."
"i know i’m arguing an unpopular side but here’s my response to someone else when regarding the counting numbers arguement   &gt; for example, luka and trae young both beat out kawhi in terms of volume and effiency last year. This year kyrie is averaging more points on better efficiency than Harden. Harden since his 2nd (i believe) year on houston has averaged more than Durant on slightly worse effiency but they aren’t seen as comparable scorers. Kyrie is better at every asset of scoring than Harden except free throw volume  &gt; which i would argue is because of their role. If you had 4 shooters around kyrie and just had him run the entire offense he would be able to pick and choose his looks much more and get open looks with the spacing, also in the playoffs a versatile shot profile seems to hold higher value. This is why i brought up my points about Luka Young and Kawhi, which doesn’t have a response to either"
"Still don't understand how Trae Young is getting twice as many FTAs as LeBron this season, you know there is something seriously wrong with officiating in this sport when that is happening."
"I am aware, didn’t feel the need to add an /s to my comment suggesting Trae young shoots 88% from 3"
"Okay, the Knicks had a team better than star player Trae Young. Lol that’s really sad.   Next question: Why did Luka make all-NBA first team but Trae didn’t make any of the 3?"
"Yeah I mean, all of that is fine, I think we just have different ideas about what a HOF'er should be. Like if all that matters is stats and accolades, then Trae Young is gonna be a sure thing for the HOF even if he never wins more than 35 games in a season (he will get over that hump at some point). I just think there's a lot of guys that the media/fans fall in love with sometimes that put up empty numbers on teams that don't go anywhere.   At no point in any of those MVP/stat leader seasons did I feel like he was a top 5 guy that I would want on my team with a playoff series on the line, and I feel like that has to overshadow those accolades a little bit"
Why shouldn't Trae be an all star lock. He's numbers are trending up and are tainted because of one of the worst stretches of his young career and better yet he's now leading a winning team as well. Unless Trae goes through another large slump or the hawks fall of a cliff I don't see any reason why he shouldn't be an all star lock.
"for example, luka and trae young both beat out kawhi in terms of volume and effiency last year. This year kyrie is averaging more points on better efficiency than Harden. Harden since his 2nd (i believe) year on houston has averaged more than Durant on slightly worse effiency but they aren’t seen as comparable scorers. Kyrie is better at every asset of scoring than Harden except free throw volume"
"People were calling him an average to below average shooter literally last week lmao. Its just funny that this place has a different set of rules for their golden boys and rush to make excuses for them. The hawks had a dogshit roster but its all on Young because they couldn't win games, but Luka gets a pass.  Luka is shooting poorly? Must be the team around him! Gets a triple double in a loss? He's playing so great and his teammates let him down (where as WB is statpadding). And of course the ""he plays winning basketball"" despite the loss when guys like Trae/Russ/disrespected player of the week get dumped on for being empty calorie guys."
I can speak your language.  Ahem.   Trae Young. Empty stats.
Oh I agree. I’ve just seems it a lot online. I look at Trae Young last year and this it’s the same thing. Terrible team but great individual season
"East Starters: Beal, Brown, KD, Giannis, Embiid  East Reserves: Simmons, Kyrie, Tatum, Sabonis, Bam, Trae young, Middleton  West Starters: Curry, Luka, Kawhi, LBJ, Jokic West Reserves: Dame, Mitchell, PG13, AD, Gobert, Ingram  And I got one open spot on west reserve cause I can’t decide lol"
Luka Dončić isn’t a better playmaker than Trae Young.   Oops. I’m on r/NBA. I need to delude myself that Luka Dončić is the greatest playmaker of all time.
"Top 10 !?! Right now ? Uh lets see Curry, Dame, kyrie , cp3, john wall , ben simmons , trae young , ja morant, deaaron fox , kemba, jamal murray are all better rn"
You literally passed on Luka Doncic for Trae Young lmfao
Clippers I'm definitely behind. I'll probably warm up to the hawks once I get over the few games we've played against each other because trae young getting to the free throw line is still etched into my mind
"Trae ""43% career FG%"" Young in shambles"
"Do you think the critique of covering for trae's defense being a critical flaw has anything to do with a nice little stretch early in the year, or is it more likely a point about the hawks ability to actually contend for anything?    Insofar as the hawks can make the playoffs in the east, sure, lots of flawed teams can make playoffs, and good on them if they do. But just like the sixers or bucks can be a dominant force year in/year out and then get found wanting in a 7 game series, I'd say any real ""i told you so's"" should prolly wait until, I dunno, the hawks are more than hovering over .500 20 games in?  All that said if the hawks win a title with trae young as their best player I'll happily take my medicine.  Hell, they don't even have to win it--if they get to the Finals that'd be shocking enough."
"This person still has a legitimate argument except the “better numbers” bit. Their numbers were pretty similar but one is an all star starter and one doesnt make the all star team at all. People said Beal didnt deserve to make the all star team because his team had a terrible record but then Trae Young started the game when his team had a worse record. I think that’s what their argument is focused on, not Beal deserving the spot over Trae."
I’ve watched more hawks games this year than any other team besides the bulls.  Every post praising trae and you hawks fans come swarming in and downvote everyone.  Then we get the posts criticizing his pussy ass way of playing the game and you guys get downvoted.  I’ll take my downvotes on this post but the  majority of basketball fans are not happy with the way guys like harden and trae exploit the rules of a foul. It’s ruining the game for many fans.  Try to defend it all you like. To me trae young is talented but plays the game by finding exploiting the rules and those rules need to change.

Trae ”barely Beal” Young
Trae Young is garbage!  I dont understand why anyone thinks the Hawks will ever be a contender trying to build around him.
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"his stats are always really gaudy in wins or losses so a game recap or highlights tape will always say some shit like ""trae young had 30 pts and 14 assists despite the hawks loss"""
I can gladly say I do not watch Trae Young play and will avoid it all costs unless he’s playing the Nets.   For the record I do like the rest of the Hawks team though.
Right! I mean Trae Young is scoring a bunch loads of points due to foul bating and no one is giving him an MVP nomination. smh.
Because Trae Young deserves 17 FTA. lmfao. Basketball just isn't fun to watch anymore w/ shit like this.
Trae Young will always be hated and there's absolutely nothing he can do to change it.  The free throws are just a single instance in a long line of narratives spun against him before he even sniffed an NBA floor.  People want to hate him. They'll always find a way to do it. Simple as that.
Trae Young Sooners  Chris Paul Wake Forest
Throw in Trae Young (after extending him of course) and you have a deal
"Dude has an actual legit chance at starting again in allstar game... A complete opposite to last year's debacle. ""tRaE yOuNg IsN't aN aLlStAr... HaWkS hAvE a BaD rEcOrD""..."
Trae Young in shambles
"the CP3/Trae Young jerk back into a defender to draw a foul shit needs to end.  Steve Nash is right, that shit isn't basketball.   I'd also like to see a lot less of the offensive player coming off the screen immediately going up and flailing for a shooting foul nonsense (looking at you Dame, Harden, Trae Young again)."
"Pascal ""Trae ""Devin ""Despite The Loss"" Booker"" Young"" Siakam lol"
Trae Young is having a classic Harden season - vastly more FTs attempted than FG made.
"&gt; Trae Young drops 41/3/5  Wow, nice!  &gt; on 10 made shots  Incredible  &gt; 14 straight in the 4th to close out  Holy shit  &gt; the Wizards  Ah, that explains it, disregard everything."
i am again struck by the fact that trae young *still* looks identical to a (now) fifth grade student at my school
"Have you seen Keinrich Williams hair? Thats the obvious choice, but I do agree with Trae ""Baby Hair"" young having the worst hair in the NBA."
"Trae young 17 free-throws, that's just absurd.  I didn't watch the game tho was he getting fouled hard??"
"Trae ""Bradley Beal"" Young"
"Trae ""Despite the Win"" Young"
#WE LIKE THE TRAE YOUNG
"I'm not a fashionista. I just have eyes. Your black and gold jerseys are fire.  And, the answer is always Trae Young... or, if you mean of the two teams playing tonight, Meth Curry is on our bench."
elfrid payton chose to have a shitty haircut and now his hair looks fine. trae young will look like an ugly baby for the rest of time
Trae Young is such a sweaty player
"James Harden, Trae Young, Marcus Smart  Every possession ez fts"
"D'Angelo Russell, Trae Young, DJ Augustin"
Idk what stan means.  Luka is fine.  He is 20x better than Trae never will win a playoff series Young
"""Or trae young"" lemme guess your a luka stan"
No one follows these rabbit holes this far.  Not my first rodeo with a Lebron or Trae Young fanboy
"This:     When Curry entered the NBA in 2009, the average NBA team attempted 18 threes a game. It hovered around that mark for the first three years of Curry's career until his breakout season of 2012-13 which just so happened to coincide with the NBA itself becoming more 3-point happy. The same year that Golden State's golden child set the all-time record for made 3s (a record he would go on to break multiple times in the coming years), NBA teams for the first time averaged 20 3-point attempts per game.  As Curry's shooting continued to explode and the [Warriors](https://ca.nba.com/contestant/golden-state-warriors/news/btbrq55c3e6btsf1z2poaakb4) transformed into a juggernaut, the rest of the league ramped up its efforts to keep pace with the free-wheeling Warriors. By the 2018-19 season, the fifth straight year that Curry's Warriors reached the NBA Finals, teams were shooting over 32 of them per game.  In that 2012-13 breakout campaign, Curry hoisted 7.7 per game and was the only player in the entire league to average at least seven. Care to guess how many players topped that threshold this season?  28.  There were 28 instances of something this season alone that had only happened a grand total of 28 times in NBA history prior to Curry's arrival.  Kids all over the world have spent the better part of the last decade emulating Curry in driveways, parks and gyms, a trend helped by the fact that Curry is about as physically relatable as any superstar in the history of the game. You can't just go in the driveway and uncork drop-step dunks. Or look in the mirror and pretend to be chiseled like LeBron. Even the famous tagline 'Be Like Mike' ignores the fact that it's utterly impossible to replicate the 6'6"" Air Jordan.  But anyone can heave as many off-balance 3s as humanly possible. Look no further than the NBA itself as James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker, Trae Young and many others have followed in Curry's footsteps and leaned into the novel concept of 3 &gt; 2.  The 3-point revolution represents the biggest on-court strategic change in the history of the sport and there's no player more single-handed responsible for it than the original Splash Brother.  ""Seldom are game-changers idle."""
"They were both top 5-ish recruits and ESPN would not shut the fuck up about them (from what I remember at the time anyway, it wasn’t Zion or Trae Young levels of annoying). One of them had a really clutch run through the tournament too. It was pretty clear they weren’t NBA level if you actually watched them play though."
Trae Young was too busy busting ass in 6th grade gym class to worry about D Rose.
"Russ, Wall, Steph, Trae Young, Luka, Simmons, Dame, Morant all average more than 6apg for their careers."
Where was Trae Young during Derrick Rose era? Probably scared cuz he didn't want no d. Rose smoke.
Trust me guys this sub is right like hes not even worth like jamal murray he's basically just fat trae young god such trash learn to defnd maybe??????? lol  -this sub about a fucking legend before their eyes the last decade.
"&gt;Beal has been in the playoffs multiple times. Trae hasn't, but again watch the teams and look at their on/off numbers. Understand basketball beyond the damn box score.  Beal has never made the playoff without Wall (who has a better record than Beal) ......Trae doesnt fit your logic but ....""you've seen him play and in your OPINION, he is better???"" You haven't referenced any stats but winning stats and your logic is still inconsistent.  hahaha  I never said those players were better, I'm arguing your points because you come off smug, asking why people dont get that your right based on your own opinions.   &gt;I sometimes forget how young this sub runs and have to remembered I'm probably talking with a 15 year old who has no idea how to have a conversation and resorts to ""lol"" ""lmao"" ""exposed"" and thinks if I say words enough time maybe it'll be true. If you're reading earnestly you'll see there's no inconsistency.  Damn dude, what do I keep saying about forming assumptions and taking it as evidence.   [https://imgur.com/tkuyjBd](https://imgur.com/tkuyjBd)  I'm definitely not 15, no bro I'm a data scientist, that's why I'm annoyed with how very little factual data you use to form opinions and base those opinions as truths,"
"&gt;You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense  Again, you say I'm the one attacking yet this is your response.   &gt;What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.  So Lavine is better than all those players mentioned because of PPG and TS%? And what do you even mean by comprehension?  &gt;Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  That's true. Do you think Lavine is better than all those players? Do you think swapping Lavine with any of those players makes the team better?   &gt;Since you value winning so much  Again, you're only reading what you want to read. I was showing how your logic of ""only objective"" is heavily flawed.   &gt;Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins  Beal has been in the playoffs multiple times. Trae hasn't, but again watch the teams and look at their on/off numbers. Understand basketball beyond the damn box score.   &gt;It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao  I sometimes forget how young this sub runs and have to remembered I'm probably talking with a 15 year old who has no idea how to have a conversation and resorts to ""lol"" ""lmao"" ""exposed"" and thinks if I say words enough time maybe it'll be true. If you're reading earnestly you'll see there's no inconsistency.  Lavine is a great player to discuss this year, it's too bad you can't do that. Again, just because I don't have a stat that doesn't show missed passes or bad passes, doesn't mean it's not true. If you can't form opinions beyond box scores then there's not much I can do for you."
Trae Young and Lavine too?
"if counting (offensive) stats matter that much while defense and advanced stats are ignored then Trae Young, Beal, and Lavine are all clear locks"
"Trae young, Luka doncic, James harden. These are my favorite players to watch"
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
Trae Young. I love watching him jump into defenders and get FTs.
"Tilman=Trae Young, Sarver=CP3"
"The league’s inability to limit foul baiting and free throw drawing is infuriating and I have to think it’s bad for the league. Nobody likes watching free throws, they’re inherently boring outside of the final seconds. It also messes with the pace and flow of the game. Plus the plays themselves are obnoxious. Even when players on your own team do them there’s not much satisfaction in watching a guy flail his arms or snap his head back.   It’s not really the player’s fault: they are playing by the rules to gain an advantage. And even the refs seem to be calling it as the league wants (there’s too much consistency to be an individual ref issue). I think the league really needs to pivot with the way the game is called. There’s simply too much advantage given to offensive players to the point where it’s near impossible to play defense. Like, say a dude (like Trae) is sprinting off a screen. The defender has to sprint after him and try to dodge the screen (while going over to prevent the open 3). But then Trae just stops immediately and the expectation is for the defender to somehow read his mind and stop simultaneously? That’s almost impossible. Similarly, how many times have we seen an offensive player simply lunge into a defender who is retreating and get the whistle? How is a defender supposed to defend that? Retreat faster? Everything is skewed toward the offense right now to the point that defenders have so few options.   And the sad thing is that the players who actually try to play straight up get punished. A lot of role players and young guys often attack the basket but don’t aim for the foul call, so they absorb tons of contact and miss the shot without a call. Meanwhile you have guys like Harden or Butler intentionally slamming into guys or hooking dudes’ arms to get foul calls. It’s rewarding all of the wrong things."
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
Bro look at some of these toxic ass comments on this thread. We’ve got comments like “YEAHHHHH FUCK TRAE YOUNG!”   Like he’s an annoying gremlin for sure but damn the league hates his ass.
What stats have Lavine as (one of) the worst defender in the NBA? He’s not spectacular but he has improved and is certainly miles ahead of guys like Trae Young or IT

Young Trae why you floppin so hard?   why these refs whistling hard?
"Wait wait wait, counter-point, look at what Andre Igoudala did to the Grizzlies. He basically said “I won’t play for you” and packed his bags and waited to get traded or waived. He didn’t get punished for it! He didn’t get fined (or if he did, I don’t remember it). Even though he’s probably not a net positive on the court at this stage in his career, he still got signed to a nice contract on what ended up being a finals team.   This Draymond take is a couple decades old now and it doesn’t really work anymore. We’re in an era of unprecedented player empowerment. How can you say that teams have an unfair advantage when a guy like Trae Young can force his team to make a trade during his rookie season? How can you say that teams have an unfair advantage when LeBron was able to hold the city of Cleveland hostage on a series of 1-year deals? And sure, everyone clowned Harden for not acting like a professional, but he wasn’t!  For every Isaiah Thomas-style organization backstab, there’s a player like Kyrie on the other end who was able to force a trade.   How about we just stop pretending that teams have an unfair advantage and just acknowledge that both players and organizations treat the NBA like it is; a business. Why is that still shocking to people, especially to smart players like Draymond?"
"My thinking would be that the absolute locks are:  1. Giannis 2. KD 3. Emiid 4. Tatum 5. Beal 6. Kyrie 7. Harden  I'm genuinely not convinced Harden deserves it, but we all know he's going to get in so I'll chalk him up as a lock.   Then I assume Zach LaVine, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown gets the nod so we're down to two spots left. Lots of competition for those two spots, and at the moment, that's only 1 player from each of the top two teams. Usually they find a way to shoe-horn in two players from the top teams. Middleton is easy, but 76ers is a tougher call.   It'll be interesting to see."
"True, but Curry isn’t scoring the same amount vs MJ then he would vs someone like Trae Young (no disrespect to Trae ijs)"
Young Trae
Trae Young
Trae Young
Is it just me or does trae young look like a really old crazy scientist with his hair?
"I'm sure,  I get it I'm not as high on Trae Young as some. There's some obvious wart's in his game. But I'd lying to say that doesn't have talent"
didnt you already post the exact same shit yesterday? whats your obsession with trae young lol
"Imo basketball is one of those sports that a player can be any height, any speed, and not be athletic (Trae Young) and still be just as good (as long as they have good endurance). There's so many things shorter players can easily do that taller players have a hard time with like Staying infront of someone shorter/quicker, racking up steals, taking charges, recovering loose balls, shooting, ball handling etc.    Since basketball is a physical sport, the bigger and stronger player will always have bigger impact **if** he's just as skilled in his position as the shorter player is in his. Sure KD might have an easier time scoring than Curry, but Curry can do just as much without even trying as well.  Curry can keep the ball in his hands for a whiiiile since he's got a tight handle and it's hard to steal it from him but for KD, he'd rather play off ball because he cant take everyone off the dribble. He's also skinny so he'd rather not have the ball too long because aggressive defensive might stress him and he might lose his handle or he might get bullied by a defender if the ref doesn't call it.  With great power, comes great responsibility. Jk, I just wanted to say that. ."
"Trae Young is easily the most boring, annoying player to watch in the NBA. He flops so much it makes no sense. It's not like he doesn't have talent, he just choses to play that way for some reason which makes no sense."
"He leaned into contact on a drive and got the call, this is nothing new in the NBA and definitely not a noteworthy foul by anyone’s standards. This bad call by the ref is really what’s getting y’all riled up? Calling him a rat bitch, insufferable, etc. Smh. Everyone wants to find new ways to hate young players, I really don’t understand it.         Trae really lives rent free in y’all’s heads."
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
Hello? Police? Trae Young trynna beat me up!
"We looked great for a bit but I think there's a 3 way beef between Collins, Young, and Pierce going on that we'll hear about once Colliins and LP are inevitably moved.     Tbh Collins had no busy calling Young a ball hog when he can't do anything without being set up by Trae. Trae needs to get over himself and play hard again.     LP may be a good coach and I love him as a person and citizen, but unless we wanna get rid of Young, we gotta move LP."
Bro if the Hawks are Goliath then any actually good team has to the equivalent of One-Punch Man.      Trae young hasn't even had a season with 30 wins yet.
"Yup you've got it. It's why the Mav's just doubled him the entire game and won. Literally no one else on this team has a handle at all.      We either have to give up on the Ice Trae Hawks (not happening) OR We need to sell on Collins ASAP and get our chemistry right with everyone around Young, that means having literally any shot creation outside of Young."
A poor man's Trae Young.
how is trae young a lock? he can't guard a traffic cone
"I agree with all of these, BUT... JB and Devin Booker are close. Very close. The only edge I give is Donovan is better then Book on defense and better then JB on shooting and playmaking. ALSO. I know he is a great playmaker and shooter but Trae Young is not as good as Donovan."
Trae young just isn't fun to watch.
"Trae Young has become one of my least favorite players to watch. He's so talented but that whining, foul baiting....yuck."
Dude tonight was really bad for us regarding Trae young. We don’t really have a guy that gets those calls so it’s extremely frustrating most games
"Zach has an argument over Booker and Mitchell so far this season. Most fans aren’t willing to hear any of it cuz they can’t go look past team record while conveniently ignoring the players that surround these three young SGs. Two of Zach’s best team mates are coming off the bench this season so far...   And with tonight’s results, Zach has big argument over Trae too."
"I see your point. I'm down voted for speaking facts which is what I also get on the hawks subreddit when I question trae. But by the letter of the law, this play is a foul. Gibson jumps instead of just running into him so if you don't understand the rule, you think it's a foul but that doesn't change the outcome. Trae got their first, Taj tried to jump so he had a chance to get the call but the ref called it like it supposed to be called according to the rule.   You can dislike the call, you can dislike the rule. I am NOT a trae young fan even though I am a huge hawks fan but this is a foul. Down vote me all you want, I won't delete my comments."
FUCK TRAE YOUNG!
I'm sure Trae is a nice dude but I absolutely hate his style of basketball. I don't like that Hardenball has caught on with some young players
I agree. I loved the arching Trae put up 35 and 15 every other night. He was electrifying and the whole mood around the team was so fun. Now it seems like all the life had been sucked out and I blame Pierce. He’s trying to change how Trae plays and I don’t like it. He’s not the Steve Nash Pierce is trying to turn him into. He’s Trae Young
It was odd seeing Young so passive. People will knock the foul baiting but he didn't even try it after it was working all game. He did generate some open shots but imo I'd rather Trae do whatever than give Cam Reddish  3s his shot looked *bad* tonight
"Did you see the hawks mavs game? Luka was an all star, trae looked lost  Hawks too young"
Trae Young doesn't want to be like John Stockton
Great game.. I think I actually like that guy Mays on the Hawks more than Trae Young.  He seems pretty talented.
"I mean, I hate Trae Young as much as anyone (I have a list of Hawks flairs that told me he'd average 25/12 this season that I am going to mercilessly troll throughout the season), that said he's averaging 26/9.5.  It's going to be hard to keep him off the roster."
Imagine getting bullied by Trae young
Great win. Randle’s transformation is ridiculous. Trae Young is still insufferable. Definitely nice to beat that raggedy baby haired fuck
Trae Young 23 points on 6-19 shooting🤢  refs gave him every single call he could ask.
*PERSONAL FOUL. ON u/ep24. TWO SHOTS FOR NO.11 TRAE YOUNG.*
"You should try watching Trae Young, least fouls ever"
"&gt;I don't really watch the Hawks much  **I think that's your answer**. He just isn't worth the max -- Collins is a good young player but when the Hawks really need him, he's not making the impactful plays that you want someone who is making the max to do. His stats are good but he doesn't pass the eye test. And paying him the max ruins any flexibility that we have going forward, especially when we are going to have to max Trae soon as well.   Now please stop proposing stupid trade proposals for him, they're not gonna happen. The hawks will still fuck this up and we will still max him once someone matches it in FA, despite what I said above."
TRAE YOUNG A BITCHASS UGLY ASS TRASH ASS PLAYER
YERRRRRR AND FUCK TRAE YOUNG AND THE REFS FROM THE TOP OF THE FUCKING RAFTERS
#YERRRRRRRR  #FUCK TRAE YOUNG
Julius is an all star no doubt. Also Trae Young is a turnstile on defense
Fuck trae young makes the game so hard to watch
"No wonder stars flop like fucking dolphins in this league. Trae young averages 10 free throw attempts a game to Zach’s 5, while Zach goes to the rim more often than Young. Absolute joke."
Why is everyone upset at Trae Young for getting these fouls but Harden is a top 3 scorer ever? Young is a product of Harden. This is going to be the new trend in the NBA.
They’re giving the Max to Trae and I think they don’t wanna tie their future to a Young/Collins core
"I think he's worthy, the question is: who are you kicking off this list?   Giannis  KD  Harden  Kyrie  Embiid  Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Trae Young  Bam  Beal  Khris Middleton  Zach Lavine   And that's without mentioning Gordon Hayward, Sabonis/Turner from Indy, FVV/Lowry/Siakam or Vucevic plus whoever else I am forgetting (and I am undoubtedly forgetting some good candidates).  All-Star is no joke this year in either conference."
lol I went on twitter and saw trae young trending. Goddamn people are turning on him too.
Trae Young with consistent hair
He's just really committed to defending Trae Young in this thread. It's almost admirable.
big brain move to completely rework the free throw rules because trae young flopping for 10 fouls every game and shooting 25 free throws is too boring for viewers
Think more people are finally getting the Trae young foul experience lol. It’s a rough watch
The Hawks are not relevant enough for this degree of unjustified hate.   What did Trae Young do to you?
Abolish Trae Young!!!1
Knicks players can’t even guard trae young anymore because they’re scared to get a foul call. He’s getting wide open shots now
3-10 shooting with 9FT's and kept hawks so close when they were getting shit on with those free throws     now they're in the lead      TRAE young getting foul calls only MJ might get lmao
"Honestly fuck Trae Young, and I would literally give IQ my first born, but I get irrationally made when he foul bates too. I know it's blame the game not the players but still, it is not fun to watch at all."
Trae young needs a redemption arc a la harden
Trae young is lame as hell
"Uhm no. But thats like saying ""Child hunger is a problem only to Sudan"". The Problem is in general but Sudan/Trae Young are the biggest standouts"
ALL MY HOMIES HATE TRAE YOUNG
Because this is a problem exclusive to Trae Young?
was trae young always this big of a foul baiter?
Which Trae Young is also fucking shit at
man fuck trae young. it’s honestly sad watching a player foul bait like this.
Trae young getting his troll on tonight trying to foul bait
Trae Young trash talking Julius fucking Randle like he wouldn’t be dead before anyone could figure out what happened   Get your bitch ass outta here
Trae Young got dirt on Adam Silver and the entire ref crew it's really truly sad to see 😔
Does Trae Young play basketball or does he just draw fouls?
"Trae young is treated like Jordan out there by the refs, disgusting"
Trae Young fuckin blows
"Trae Young is a completely unwatchable player, exclusively goes for fouls."
trae young is actually such a cancer for the game
Fuck Trae Young this dude plays the weakest brand of basketball in history  Cobwebs on a lollipop head ass
We need to start a Fuck Trae Young thread
why the fuck is trae young getting calls even bron curry dont get
Fuck Trae young and the nba for allowing refs to call this shit
Fuck Trae Young and fuck these refs
"Curry's been ben's consensus best player in the league since 2015. He's 6 3 but was the best player on the best team in bball history. By pm the guard is by far the most impactful position on the court since the 3 point revolution. This era is the era that has given players like trae young the opportunity to be elite. In fact curry, trae and kyrie couldn't do what they do if they were any taller. It's the same reason Messi's height benefits him, for a guard acceleration is extremely important, shorter guys accelerate much faster and have an easier time handling the ball."
"Trae young just flops all game, I hate it"
Quickley with a vintage trae young move
Trae Young literally jumped into Derrick Rose and they called a foul on Rose. Thats wild
"I understand that, but Thibs is a respected veteran coach who they pushed back against (as well as Jimmy) while they were winning and making a playoff push for the first time in their careers.    LP was a new coach in way over his head and consistently hurting the team with his coaching decisions on the court in addition to butting heads with the young players off it.    I can understand how/why kowtowing to Trae might not be a good idea but it's a different scenario from Thibs.  That said of course this could still go sideways and this whole thing burns down like Minny looks like it's going to, who knows."
"Everyone is gonna only read the headline and not the article cuz they wanna hate on Trae Young lmao. Pierce lost the entire team, and deservedly if all of this is true."
"11 of their losses are blown 4th quarter leads, and most of those aren't like ""oh they were up by 4,"" talking 10, 20 point leads.  they went 4-11 in February  there was a pattern of poor rotations in the 3rd and 4th qtrs (forcing Gallo at the 5, benching Capela for too long if he's in foul trouble), not calling timeouts at the right time (basically had to be a 15-0 run for him to call one), and really questionable drawn up plays (uhh give ball to Trae and hope he scores, sweet play)  Also, I haven't ready it yet but apparently according to the Athletic he had long lost the locker room, if he had ever had it to begin with. It went way further than Trae Young butting heads with him."
"Trae Young and Lloyd Pierce just couldn't coexist. Don't forget that when Lloyd Pierce, assistant coach for Team USA, was asked if it was hard to see Trae not make the Olympic roster, he said ""No."" Right or wrong, he just didn't show much love for his players."
Imagine shooting 9 percent from 3 in a month and now almost having the same percentage as Trae Young.
"Correct, we also don't know if it was Trae Young himself who said it.  That's why it's anonymous."
"Its a negative for the game as a whole. When I watch games on my DVR, I fast forward through free throws.  No one want to watch guys go to the line.  Trae Young is one of the league's most dynamic talents and I want to see him attack.  Plus, at his size, he's inevitably going to get hurt trying to get people to run into him."
"Not particularly, no. Not Trae Young tier or anything, but very, very far drom DPOY conversation."
This is half the nba. The best way to be an star nba player is to be recognized as a star nba player the. You start getting calls on both sides of the court. It’s all over the plays players like trae young and harden get calls other players don’t while shooting. Good defensive players like kawhi can get away with reaching in. Gobert gets away with fouling while shot blocking.
This is some detailed ass reporting for 24 hours removed of a coaching change.  I believe all this was going on way before this year.  But this team has a leak problem from one of its players.  And I think it’s from the most important players camp.  The Haynes article came out last year after one of the games mentioned and then earlier this year an article came out about Trae and John and also had specific quotes about a conversation between Trae and Clint.  The hawks already decided to end their tank early because of Trae and now he’s most likely lead the charge to have Pierce fired.  Anyone that watched how Trae acted during timeouts should have known that Trae didn’t like Lloyd.  I say should have because hawks fans literally said it was overblown for a year.  Until recently when they decided they wanted Lloyd gone.  Then that recognized as a problem.  The next question is what coach will want to come to Atlanta when it’s last coach was given 34 games when not tanking and a young star that has that much juice with the team?
"Someone once said Trae Young is the best offensive player in the league, not LeBron, not Curry, not KD, not Harden, Trae Young."
what if he already was addressing it internally and was continuously being ignored? what other option does he have to get his point across? it’s not like this quote was the start of the beef between him and Trae Young. we heard during the off-season that trae wants Lloyd gone.
"your problem is actually taking anything anyone on this sub says seriously  people here will literally see a guy struggling at something over like a 10-game span and just call them a bust. people were fully saying trae young was better than luka earlier in the year because he was mildly out of shape and wasn't hitting his 3s. people here just kind of react, including myself if we are being honest"
It’s pretty crazy it’s like someone saying trae young is playing on the blazers and Luka is on the knicks in 2036
"He said that if Lamelo was on the knicks he’d be an all star “for sure”, and that’s completely wrong.    He’s averaging 15.7/6.0/6.4 on decent shooting.    The two east starting guards are Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal, he obviously would not have eclipsed them in fan voting, which again is only half of the equation for all star starters.    If he wasn’t a starter he’d have to be chosen by the coaches, which he wouldn’t be. Again, 15/6/6 on ok shooting not gonna cut it for a guard in the east. Trae Young didn’t make it on 27/9/4!!!    So GTFOH with that"
"I know you can’t relate cause you’re a Mavs fan, but imagine for a second that you’re constantly seeing Trae Young highlights and posts on the sub when you know for a fact your boy Luka is balling out. That would be annoying, right?"
7/21 is your average Trae Young game. Usually he supplements it with 14 FTs to get up to that 30ppg
After seeing the comment made by /u/AlVic40117560- I decided to watch the play by play highlights to see Dort's defense on Trae Young and he had no problem getting by Dort at all on almost every shot attempt. dort played some good defense without fouling but every screen had him like 3 or 4 feet behind in the dust on a Trae drive.
Either Trae young missed a payment or the refs' fantasy opponent had trae young on them
defending a player like Trae Young without giving away free throws for a whole game no matter who it is is legit impressive. It just happened to be Dort
Nate McMillan also had to coach trae young and he managed to win as many games as LP this month.
Not his fault that Trae Young is on the team
Trae Young in Kawhi’s body
Imagine being trae young just minding your business and then a fucking DORT comes along and ruins your day.
Trae Young started last year after having one of the worst records in the league. Guess Hawks fans just assume he’ll be an all star no matter what after that.
Jimmy gets calls like Trae Young
I thought he was a liability..:and then I watched Trae Young
"&gt; Trae Young is far better than Sabonis and it’s not even close  Explain to us why, and why it isn’t even close"
"*Trae Young hits a 3*  ""And Westbrook hits the 3""  ""Now they're saying it was Al Horford"""
"Trae young now the unanimous best player not in the all star game? (Yes I mentioned Trae young in a positive light, ya don’t need to downvote me to the depths of hell)"
Yup Trae Young fans are just as annoying as Trae Young is.
Honestly lebron is wrong bro. Trae young is the most disrespected star in this league. If the nba is gonna allow foul baiting then coaches should have nothing against it.
"Would argue that Indiana has the better coaching and defense but when healthy the Hawks are downright better. Health has killed the Hawks and the coaching has been very, very bad.  Trae has been more efficient and oberall better than last year. His team is better than it was last year. He was voted as the all star starter last year and despite having a better season, is snubbed. It is quite funny how that works.  Trae is the 8th scorer in the league and top 5 playmaker. The fact that he didnt make it is mind boggling. If Beal can make All star starter then Young should at the very least make reserve. One of the bigger all star snubs in recent memory.  Granted if the harden trade never happened he would have made the team."
"It's gotten slightly better recently, but I saw a while ago that Trae Young was averaging more FT per game than The Raptors. That's bad."
I mean isnt trae young made fun of because of his height  and dont get me started on the shit luka takes and being called a soft guy when the euro league is more physical   not to mention luka not getting many calls during last years clippers series for example when beverly wanted to injure luka after a play (dont remember the specific instance)
Did Trae Young dirty
[Trae Young watching Sabonis and Tatum join the All-Star team](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/024/615/Screen_Shot_2017-11-10_at_10.36.15_AM.jpg)
"I don't blame Trae at all, coaches need to learn that until there's a rule change foul baiting will become the new normal. Young guys growing up and seeing guys like James Harden and Giannis dominate  in part by getting foul calls."
"You’re 14-18, the Pacers are 15-15 so it’s not even like that’s a substantial advantage. People just irrationally dislike Trae Young for whatever reason. And people can say “worst defender ever” or whatever but Beal and Lillard are grading out worse this year and are seemingly unquestionable all stars"
"I’m just glad trae young was still left out, serve him right for foul bating"
Trae Young is far better than Sabonis and it's not even close. The fact that anyone would believe otherwise is astonishing. Christ.
Super biased but that feels like the right decision. Sabonis felt like the biggest snub to me. Trae Young would have been fine as well. I still think both should have been in over Vuc and Tatum personally.
Great so we can stop complaining.  Everybody who deserves it got in.  Or do we still have to placate Trae Young.  Whose gonna take one for the team?
It should be Trae Young considering he’s way better
"I think you look at his defense more positively than I do. His issue on defense isn't a lack of strength, it's a lack of interest.  I think he's a tall Trae Young, which is a very (very) good player, but also kind of a rough fit on the Warriors *as a starter* with the rest of the guys."
"Teams don’t single him out like they do Trae Young or Steph Curry, so he’s de facto a good defender."
&gt;And you’re acting like it’s fun to watch Trae young or James harden flail around the court.  I don't think anyone is acting like that
"Yeah that’s such bullshit and an incompetent take. Gobert is the most impactful defender in the league but we’ve seen for years now where if your center just drops back in the paint, you’re perimeter defenders are under big pressure to get over screens with no help. And look at the dominant players who won titles the past few years - Lebron, KD, Curry, Klay. Drop defense does little to prevent outside shot making. This isn’t the 90’s, perimeter defense matters big time. The whole warriors dynasty was built on a switchable defense, which by definition requires capable perimeter versatile perimeter defenders. This whole “PG defense doesn’t matter” is regurgitated BS. I’m waiting for the hawks to build a legit contending team around Trae Young.  Edit: didn’t mean YOUR take was BS, was reiterating the point you were making."
Refs were bad but Bama shot 30 threes   And you’re acting like it’s fun to watch Trae young or James harden flail around the court.
Trae young is not better than Fred.
"So you're saying a guy who's playing much better shouldn't be in the game because that team has an all star? What about Trae Young, who is undoubtedly a much better player than FVV?"
"My point is that Luka and Trae are you there too, but they’re not included. Why include any such young players anyways"
"""I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter""   Trae ""Mose Schrute"" Young"
"Kawhi’s defense has gotten worse because that’s not his main job anymore. He wasn’t relied on to score, now he’s a first option averaging 25+ ppg and a 28+ ppg in the playoffs. It would be stupid to ask your best option to guard the other teams best player.  1. Their energy would be gone by having to go 100% on both ends of the court  2. They would potentially get in foul trouble from guarding a guy like harden, Luka, trae  3. Giving one guy the sole job of defending the best player would have better production due to them not having offensive expectations (Tony Allen, Bowen, Young Kawhi)"
Trae young  Playoffs  Pick one
"&gt; He’s shooting a league average TS% despite being a poor FT shooter who doesn’t shoot many FT’s per game. That’s a good thing.  How is being bad at getting to the line not a bad thing? Deandre Ayton is also terrible at getting to the line (even worse than Wiggins) so I don't go around bragging that Ayton very efficient especially if you consider he can't get to the line. Luka Doncic and Trae Young ability to get to the line help their TS% greatly but we don't go around and say ""well they get to the line a lot so it shouldn't be factored"". Wiggins inability to get to the line is on him.  &gt;And yes, shooting 1% than his career high is a big improvement  No it is not. Shooting 1% higher than your career high, or 2-3% higher than your career average can often just be statistical noise and the general variance year to year. Also considering the fact that he is playing with the best PG of this generation, I would have actually expected a much bigger jump.   &gt;Wiggins’s TS% was under 52% in 3/5 seasons.  Ya because he was on teams with low gravity and he was 19 or 20 years old on two of those season.  &gt;Draymond could shoot 40% from 3 this year and you would say he hasn’t shown a big improvement with your logic because that only beats his career high 5 years ago by 1%  That would be an 8% jump from his career average. That is equivalent to 12% increase in true shooting from his career average. Not 2% like Wiggins.  &gt;Saying someone’s efficiency sucks because he misses half point per game on FT% is just dumb and clearly shows you have an agenda to pus  The only agenda I have against is stupidity."
"Until people started gifting all star spots to Deandre Jordan, Trae Young. Ofcourse winning matters, having good stats on heavily losing team means you are playing shitty basketball. If those tanking teams are not so casual, and blatant they would never have low 20 wins season."
Then show them a Trae young and watch them have heart attack
"Among all the top young stars in the league (Luka, Trae, Booker, Tatum etc), Zion is the best scorer by far. Never seen someone who can drop 30 as effortlessly like he does at such a young age and do it so efficiently.     Hot take, but Zion has the potential to be even better than AD is. NOLA got the 2nd chance of a lifetime with Zion"
"lmao I actually love Grayson Allen. I actually don't think he was ever a dirty player, he just got victimized by some flopping ass players who cried to the media afterward. Besides honestly, they deserved it, like with Trae Young."
We drafted Obi over Deni Avdija and Devin Vassell. You drafted Marvin Bayley over Luka Doncic and Trae young. Nice try tho
"I'm not expecting him to be a Luka, but I thought he'd at least have the Trae Young jump in his 2nd year with how similar their play is."
"Yes, hence he has to prove himself in the PLAYOFFS. Same holds true for all fringe super star players. Giannis, Paul George, Luka, Trae Young etc all will be judged by their playoff performances not regular season. If you wanna show you’re not worth a Harden trade you prove it in the playoffs not regular season."
You’re tellin me this dude doesn’t play any differently when he has Ben Simmons on him than when he as Trae Young on him?
TRAE YOUNG WITH BETTER HAIR
Lebron  Dame  AD  Booker  CP3  Kawhi  PG  Steph  Klay  Donovan Mitchell  Gobert   Jokic  Murray (arguable)  KAT  SGA (arguable)  Luka  DeMar   Ja   Zion  Tatum  Jaylen Brown (arguable)  Kyrie   Harden  KD   Embiid   Ben Simmons   Beal  Russ (arguable)  Butler  Trae Young (arguable)  Giannis   That’s 30. Doesn’t even include fringe guys like Lavine or badass rookies like LaMelo.
We already have Trae Young
"I don't hate it, it has pros and cons depending on the players skills - would be a boon for guys like Trae Young and Embiid. I don't get the rationale for the last 2 minutes reverting to normal rules. I would rather let teams decline foul shots in the last 2 minutes like football and opt to have a fresh 24 instead. Make a team get a stop to get the ball back."
"Now imagine a team of Trae Young, Harden, Butler, Giannis and Embiid"
"No! There are multiple sides to a basketball game. Let's compare Trae Young and Rudy Gobert.   In 35 min, Trae Young is putting up 27 pts, 9.5 ast and 4 reb on 43.8/36.5/87.5 while playing 35 min a game. **Insane offensive numbers but then you look at his defense and he's one of the worst in the league.**   In 30 min, Gobert is putting up 14 pts, 13.3 reb and 2.8 blk on 64/0/59.2. He's a **top 3 rebounder** and is most likely going to win **DPOY**. The difference is that he's **good on offense** too. He puts up 14 points on 8 shots a game.   Sure Trae's numbers are more appealing but there are 2 sides to a basketball game."
Good list:   but I would prefer Trae Young at 1   He passes the ball better and is a solid playmaker compared to booker
LMAO came here to say exactly this...Trae Young Booty Logo
Trae young backing up to take a knee to his ass would be an iconic logo
I see it as fans being excited for their young players   Luka gets the 30 pt triple doubles  Zion gets the most points scored through x games on 60% TS   Trae gets the 35/15 games   Heck even Lamelo gets the youngest ever triple double
"The Celtics badly badly need to just reach the All Star break. The whole team needs a mental restart. Ultimately, there's not really any way to win a game like this when Gallo and Trae shot the way they did but the play on the court has been so effortless and uninspired. I said this back around the time of the bubble but the Celtics have to be one of the quietest teams I've ever seen and it's even worse right now without Smart, the one guy who actually seems to get fired up when things aren't going right. Imo with the best teams it starts at the top with the coaches and stars, and if those guys aren't showing any emotion out there then it ripples out to the rest of the team. The Jays are typically quiet and so far it's been excused since they've been so good at such a young age but if this team wants to go far, they need to be able to get the best out of their teammates. More worrisome is how Brad seems to be unable to rally the team when things get tough. I know he always has that calm demeanor but at some point it's just not working. Every game during this skid the team just comes out without any energy. I also think back to the Heat series where they blew a lead in almost every game. One play that sticks out was that Bam offensive rebound to seal the game in the final seconds. Iirc four or five Celtics were around the restricted area flat-footed with the game on the line and Bam comes from out of the paint to get the board. At this point, if you're an opponent you must feel that all you need is one big run to beat this team since they won't make any adjustments or try to fight back. It's another reason why I think it was such a mistake for Danny not to trade the recent picks. Vets and guys who have been around the league can rally a locker room, I doubt rookies averaging 8 minutes a game are going to do much."

"Harden has by every metric been a better point guard than Curry since joining the Nets, and how tf has Harden not been the best player on the Nets lmao. Durant hasnt even been playing.  1. James Harden - 303 AST : 111 TOV   2. Trae Young - 279 AST : 125 TOV   3. Luka Doncic - 267 AST : 121 TOV   4. LeBron James - 259 AST : 124 TOV  daaaaang"
Every time I see Trae Young he's doing some cheeky shit. He looks fun.
I really think Trae Young is a better player than Simmons. He’s much easier to build around. I don’t think Ben Simmons could be a serious first option. This is always going to be a back and forth argument.
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
Trae young isn’t better than Simmons. Neither is Sabonis. Worry about your two “All-Stars”.
"Please, this is nothing compared to when people were calling Trae Young a bust after a pre-season game."
"You made a snotty comment that I didn't understand what I'm talking about, after my first reply.  I look at PIPM and xRAPM when it gets made available. RPM is fine because it's available but the formula is secret and it Engellman included a bunch of extra crap like player height just to make it unique for ESPN. Ben Taylor's BPM is good for a box score stat but I absolutely trust adjusted rating/lineup stats more. The whole big benefit of advanced stats is capturing what's not recorded in normal box scores.  Booker's issue is defense. Most of his career he was in that Trae Young category of bad defender. He was better last year and he was a better playmaker last year as well, and both of those have seem to gone away. The Suns have gone from mediocre at defense to very good at it and Booker isn't contributing to that at all. Ayton is finally understanding defensive rotations and how to guard PnR, CP3 is CP3 and Bridges is one of the very, very best individual defenders in the league.   When people talk about Steph being bad at defense, it's him being mediocre among a bunch of great defenders. Booker is really bad and actually drags the good defense down."
"He doesn’t have better stats or efficiency than Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Hayward, Trae young, or Khris Middleton. You can’t just take out the parts of the season that help. If that was the case I’d say simmons is averaging 22/8/8 since febuary"
"Well if a modern day Mark Twain such and yourself states all that to be true, then I too shall believe align myself with such wisdom and follow the good path.  So bravo to you good teammate! Let's share these Trae Young tattoos together in all successful future sports glory."
This sub jerks off to Trae Young hate even when we’re winning. Not even comparable.
Trae young is so much funner to watch when he plays like this
the only this trae young does wrong is having a haircut
"Imagine the comments if Trae Young had either of these statlines. Actually I don't have to imagine because he got absolutely shit on yesterday for going 28/7/12 which is better than whatever Tatum and Brown did on the court combined. Not a knock on Tatum or Brown, just a bad game for them but I think the double standard is hilarious."
Ricky ‘trae young’ Rubio
Trae Young
Sabonis over Vuc.  Magic are not even making the playoffs if they were starting tomorrow. Sab is shooting a much better FG%  and averaging 5.7apg for a center while being on a team that is 4th in the east.   Boston doesn’t deserve to have two all stars.  Anyone of Bam or Trae young was snubbed over those two.  Spurs with the 5th spot in the west without an AS is wack. Derozan should have Zion spot because of team record. Some people will complain that the all star should not be team record but we all know Zion will get in in the future and rewarding players on bad teams should not be a thing unless there are just no other good players on good teams to give this to.   Sides that... it looks good.
"Snubbed Trae Young with 33 PTS, 12/23 FG, 4 REB, 7 AST, 1 STL straight up demolished the All-Star Jays total of 30 PTS, 10/36 FG, 5 REB, 5 AST, 3 STL.  Wait til the Hawks unleash Mascaped sponsored Trae."
Danilo Gallinari/Trae Young  Took the 30 point streak to a new level today
"Saddiq Bey, Bradley Beal, Nikola Jokic, Trae Young, Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Luka Doncic and……  Danilo fucking Gallinari"
"To be fair, you have to have a *very* high IQ to understand Trae Young’s game. His dribbling is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of gamesmanship most of the insights will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Trae’s vertical outlook, which is deftly woven into his short stature - his style of basketball draws heavily from Steve Nash, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of the foul baiting, to realize that it isn’t just basketball - he’s saying something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Trae Young truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the irony in Trae’s ironic catchphrase “that’s not really basketball,” which itself is a cryptic reference to his favorite basketball player’s post game interview on December 31st, 2020*.*   I’m smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Trae’s genius unfolds itself on the court. What fools... how I *pity* them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Trae Young tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they have a league average 36 3P% (preferably higher) beforehand."
"Trae Young is definitely a snub. Record aside he is averaging 27/10. That’s better than 99% of the league. Position wise I understand taking randle over Young, and I understand Randle is killing it, but 27/10 has to be a all star appearance surely. If his team was in the playoffs and he averaged the same then he would’ve made it. And he is only 2 games away from the Celtics who have two players. So I think the record definitely hurt Trae.  Brandon Ingram or Fox over Zion for me also. Obviously Zion is unstoppable, future perennial all star and the past couple weeks he has really been the guy, but for me Ingram’s first half was way better than Zions, and even though Zion has lifted his game, Ingram is still balling the same. Fox has taken his game to another level, the soul piece on the kings and is averaging career highs in everything . I get it would be adding another guard but I genuinely believe fox has had a better year than both Zion and Ingram."
Trae Young-ass
"Brown did not deserve his All-Star selection. His defense is massively overrated considering how often he lets players cut around him, and his offense has been slumping for a month.  Hawks fans deserve to see Trae Young at the All-Star game. He got hosed."
There’s way too play playstyles and ways to manipulate the game as a player (Trae Young this year for example) for me to just say “refs are bad lol get better”. It’s not as easy as you’re trying to imply
"Edwards is 71.5st percentile in ISO scoring per NBA.com’s ISO scoring stats. A similar percentile to SGA and Trae Young and just behind Giannis and Beal. Worth noting that he’s also 40th in ISO possessions, but between the eye test and the stats that have played out thus far this season, he’s clearly a very capable ISO scorer."
"that’s fine and all, but if you having him defend somebody, he’s not gonna defend nobody. he’s basically a PF version of trae young but paint instead of threes"
"Ingram, Wood, CJ, Tobias, Trae Young"

don’t be upset   Basketball is a hard sport  And you don’t have Trae Young
Trae young plays these refs like a fucking fiddle dude
Dame literally just stopped like Trae young be doing to draw a foul lol weak af
Trae young is 5-2 in his career vs the 76ers
sterling brown was mad as fuck after that. but hey basketball is hard when youre not Trae Young
Even still. Kyrie over Kemba. Marcus smart over Caleb Martin. Trae young over Pat Bev.
The Alpha Chad Kevin Porter Jr vs the virgin beta trae young
"Obligatory ""fuck Trae young"".  Lamelo ball or Anthony Edwards 👌"
"Honestly try finding a younger player, and just pick a team based on a favorite player, like Luka, or Trae Young or someone and just stick with them for a while"
"Because it's ""old school"" for this generation. It's the art of the craft for Kyrie. It's not necessarily about scoring the most points in the box score, but style points on the court. You see a guy like Trae Young, he's hunting for points/fouls. Kyrie is hunting to make you go wow look, make the defender look silly or leave them in the dust."
"Trae young, harden (unsure if he still does it on the nets)"
Yeah I do think Lopez is a defensive concern. If they end up against say the Knicks they might be able to get away with it more with no true deadly permiter scorer that would cook him all the time like a Trae Young for example but anything past that round will see far fewer minutes
Trae Young just pisses me off.
"Trae Young is really good, but his game is infuriating. I hate watching him play"
"I like MCW, but man I am DYING for some sort of dynamic shot creator/ball-handler type of guy. I wanted Trae Young so bad that draft.  I mean since TMac, have we even had a playmaker with a live dribble you are legitimately excited to watch? Jameer &amp; Hedo were never that, as cool as they were. Certainly post-Dwight era no one has come close."
"Wiseman’s DBPM is -.8 and Bagley‘s is -2.9. For reference, trae young who is constantly slandered for being the worst defender in the NBA’s DBPM is -1.6"
Bullshit- I've seen Foster award freethrows to Trae Young for getting his fingernails grazed.
"It's every little guard now. Trae young, Lowry, Curry, kyrie, Sexton, etc, they just reward the drivers for running into the defender. What are defenders supposed to do?"
"Jokic isn't nearly as bad as those guys. For this season, Jokic is in the 33rd percentile for center defense, while Beal in in the 8th percentile for guard defense and Lavine and Young are in the 2nd percentile for guard defense.  Jokic isn't a great defender, but he's not like these guys. I think some of them, like Trae and Dame are just legitimately bad skill wise at defense, while Lavine and Beal could be good on defense if they cared, but they're more concerned with saving energy not playing defense to have more energy to score the ball."
"SGA becomes the best player out of the current group of young guards (Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo)."
"It’s such an ugly product right now and I’m not just saying that off the back of the Knicks losing.  I remember watching Trae Young play against the Knicks earlier in the season and drawing foul, after foul, after foul. Even though I think we were winning, I could barely watch that shit."
Shades of Trae Young
"Can't deny that a player who can play both ends of the court at an elite level and be a leader (Jimmy, KD, Giannis) is hugely different than some of the ""stars"" in the league who are all offense (Kyrie, Harden, Trae Young)"
Zach Lavine has improved substantially he isn't in the same universe as trae young either.
"Drafting Bagley over Doncic and Trae Young, hiring Luke Walton without considering any other candidate, getting fleeced by Sam Hinke, the end of the Cousins era, and all the other stuff I can’t remember. I feel bad for Kings fans."
I agree but it’s funny how on this sub defensive metrics only matter if they’re saying Trae Young is the worst defender to ever pick up a basketball   Point still stands though that Trae is a significantly better version of Haliburton offensively and would be a great fit with Fox
"He’s had two great defensive plays I can remember this season that showed how much he’s improved at not biting — one on Harden last Nets game when he had a great block on a 3pt shot after not biting and one against Trae Young where Trae tried to jump into him to draw the foul but ended up just looking stupid and throwing up a terrible shot because Rob didn’t bite.   He definitely still gets over eager sometimes, but seeing how much his instincts have improved even against some of the best in the game at forcing a bite is really encouraging."
"Steph Curry, LeBron, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young"
"If Trae Young is 6, who tf is 22? Is Thad that good?"
Since 2020   JC on passes from Trae Young: 48% from 3  JC from 3 when anybody else is throwing him the pass: 26%
"Dame tried to cheat pretty much every single play in the last minute or so, sometimes even multiple times on a play if he could get a dive in on the inbound.   Pretty disgusting, and unfair that young kids like Trae and Luka get so much vitriol while the he somehow escapes any scrutiny."
Eh. Steph and Trae young would not be the best

Did you think the same thing when Trae Young had a bad first half of his rookie year?
*Trae Young likes this*
Didn't Trae Young wave and celebrate with like 45 seconds left against Miami last season in a game they lost in OT
"Case in point, Trae Young was a -9 in his rookie year."
trae young
GSW got a ginger Trae young off the bench
"He’s good, but the national media crowd saying they’d take him over Trae Young or Ja Morant should probably slow down. Listened to a podcast where a group of 4 guys asked the question “would you take him over bam” and there was very little resistance. He’s gunna be very good but some of the hype is overblown."
"Look I'm not trying to shit on Allen or anything.  If you compare the difference between his shooting ability to that of his peers at the time then that gap is likely the largest of any player besides maybe Bird.  I just think the overall shooting ability in the league has skyrocketed and continues to climb.  I understand the argument and don't think it's a stupid thing to consider Allen above them, I just think that the skill level of current shooters is higher.  I'm curious where you would rate a player like Korver.  Also I think you are being unfair to Trae Young.  He is shooting 38% this season from deep and his shot selection has improved.  The deep 3s he takes could be seen as poor shot selection, but it keeps the defenders guarding him really high up which gives him room to blow by them or set a very high pick and roll and get defenders on his back which allows him to get to the line a lot."
"Because if you actually watch basketball games you'd see how shit he is at everything but scoring.   Did you really say he's improved at defense? He was literally 6'10 Trae Young last night. His defensive IQ is that of a potato. You can't teach 6'10 but you also can't teach stupid, and this kid is literally a stupid anti-vaxxer. He also can't playmake or pass for shit.  His scoring and efficiency amounts to being the third option. You don't compare third option scorers to first option scorers in terms of efficiency. It means literally nothing. That's like comparing Seth Curry's 3 point shooting to Steph Curry and saying that the former is a better shooter because of his percentage.  &amp;#x200B;  Listing those accolades really change nothing, as they're trash compared to what Luka did before coming into the league."
"&gt;  I didn't even call you unsophisticated, only people who just want to flat out compare numbers.  Fair enough.  It seemed like you were making that implication, but if you're not I appreciate the clarification.  &gt;  Also idk what you consider prime Ray Allen, Bucks or Celtics. It's true I didn't watch him on the Bucks, but on the Celtics, he wasn't being double teamed regularly.  None of his years with the Celtics were close.  His years with the Sonics were much, much better, although the end of his Bucks tenure was solid (minus when he basically got replaced by Michael Redd).  &gt;  Also wtf, you claim Lillard has McCollum to prevent him from being double teamed? I think you are the one who does watch Lillard enough. Even with a healthy McCollum Lillard still gets double teamed on most plays. Go watch any series against where the Warriors beat the Blazers.  I can flat out promise you I've watched more Lillard than you have.  I was a few years above him on the same AAU squad, I watched him dominate from very young all the way through Alameda and have been a huge fan of his for his entire career.  The Warriors almost never double teamed Lillard.  Zone trap is not the same as double team, and Lillard purposefully drove into extra defenders so he could move the ball and work the 4v3.  Lillard purposefully driving into an occupied area of a zone to force more defenders on him and make a teammate open is not the same as shooting against a double team.  Lillard is almost always guarded by Klay 1v1 when they play the Warriors.  &gt;  Also I am a Blazers fan and a big fan of Dame, but this has nothing to do with that. Here is a list of players I also think are better shooters than Allen. Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, obviously Steph.  Dude....this is just bad.  Really bad.  Trae Young isn't even a top 10 shooter in the NBA right now.  Just because he has highlights hitting 35 footers doesn't mean he didn't miss 10 before he made that.  His shot selection is piss poor and his percentages are worse.  Not that that's the end all, and he is a talented player, but he's just not a very good shooter.  Damn the disrespect to an all time great here is savage.  Not one of those people besides Steph is a better shooter than Ray.  &gt;  I simply value the ability to create your own shot more than I value the ability to catch and shoot.  Then it might interest you to learn that Ray shot a better percentage on 3's he created than any of the people you listed in the last paragraph and Dame.  The fact that Ray Allen was shooting 40% regularly in an NBA that didn't value the 3 and would bench you for shooting off the dribble is insane.  Devaluing his accomplishments just because we're not qualifying them with context is a huge mistake."

"No. They would be 13th place in the West without Draymond rn and the Warriors would have 1-2 rings. You can’t judge that man by stats, just watch the game. Same reason why Nash has two MVP’s. Same reason I would take Haliburton over Trae Young right now. If you’re watching games you can see who is in control."

jalen brunson better than trae young
"Lamelo &gt; everyone . Srs .  To answer your questions , Ja can be the best player on a championship team.   Trae Young can be a multiple time all star, but because of defensive liabilities needs a good supporting cast to win . Extremely impactful offensive player though   Lamelo will win MVPs"
"First just wanted to point out that somehow someway Trae Young is still extremely slept on.  He's going to be so good in 5-10 years as he gets smarter and more savvy even though he already is both of those things.    I have:  1. Trae - projection: He will be a staple on the All NBA teams at this point and the best true PG in the league unless some phenom comes in and takes over.  Will be consistently averaging 30 and 10 every year and thought of as the premier NBA PG.   2. Lamelo - projection: In the next 10 years Lamelo will be a top 3-5 PG in the league and perennial all star.  Will probably be one of the league leaders in triple doubles also.  Melo will average a stat line of 24, 8, and 8 and his scoring ability, size, and court vision will set him apart from the 2nd tier PGs 3. Morant - projection: Ja will also be a top 3-5 PG but I'll put him a small notch below Melo due to his lack of size and shooting.  I think Ja will develop his 3pt shooting 10 years from now but Melo has already shown more confidence and ability in his shot already.  Either way Ja will be a top tier PG."
Trae young and Fox wouldn’t fit together as good as SGA I’m guessing that’s the reason
why is SGA going over trae young
"Edwards is a very good rookie himself, its like taking Trae Young over Luka there is no regrets."
"Facts. I mean Jordan has the DPOY, scoring titles and MVPs, but like, Lonzo Ball has made more threes than Trae Young, sooo...."
"I’m only arguing from a box score stand point not from an impact standpoint, I’m not saying that he will impact the game like Trae Young, but I don’t think he will use his fire power at his will, and instead he will do more passing just by his tendencies."
Trae young but more efficient and slightly better
I have my own Trae Young complaints but the dude is going to be a superstar very very soon
Trae Young
"He isn't an anomaly adjusted to league averages. He is just a great young offensive player, terrible defensive player, and so far lacks any sort of leadership intangibles or anything like that. He's only 22 yes, but the Hawks are going to have to decide if they are going to all in on building around Trae and trying to construct a AI Sixers type roster that just focuses solely on finding defensive pieces to fit around your PG or are they willing to move him off ball. Get another shot creator and be a more dynamic offensive team would put a lot more defensive responsibilities on Traes shoulders?"
You despise Trae Young as a Hawks fan? Why?
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop   ""Tony Snell ain't 'bout this, Tony Snell ain't 'bout that""   My boy a BD on fucking Atlanta and them   He, he, they say that buddy don't be putting in no work   Shut the fuck up   Y'all losers ain't know shit   All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about   ""Tony Snell ain't no hitter   Tony Snell ain't this   Tony Snell a fake""   Shut the fuck up   Y'all don't live with that buddy   Y'all know that buddy got caught with a ratchet   Shootin' at the police and shit   Buddy been on probation since fuckin' I don't know when   Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that   Them Hawks savages out there   If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Tony Snell   I'm fucking beatin' they ass   I'm not fucking playin' no more   Y'all know them buddies roll with Trae Young and them"
"Y’all are already are crowning Lamelo better than Trae and it’s laughable. Like, half of y’all and NBA Twitter legit think Ja and Rookie Lamelo are better than him. I fuckin despise Trae Young, but even I can recognize pure blind hatred and ignorance. No wonder there’s a counter jerk"
"I’d push back on that  2020 ROY: Ja Morant, point guard 2019 ROY: Luka, point guard 2019 runner up: Trae Young 2018 ROY: Ben Simmons 2017 Malcolm Brogdon   You have to go all the way back to 2016 (KAT) to find a rookie of the year that isn’t a point guard."
It was a thread last night and it carried over to this one because I think Hawks fans are delusional. I understand the limitations of Ayton. He isn't Hakeem or DRob but he is a good young player. Hawks fans treat Trae like he could do what only Steph has done out of the current crop of golden age PGs we have right now and lead a team to a chip as the number 1 option. Plus they always have to talk shit about Book whenever I criticize him. Zoomers in general just seem to love him so much but I just don't see it. I think he can be a part of your core but to build around him is delusional and I want the Hawks to be good. They need another ball handler to open up Trae's off ball game. Thats why i thought a cheap Oladipo rental couldn't hurt.
I feel like this is a normal headline for Trae Young highlights now
"Not just on here but I haven't hear a single national analyst say that Trae could lead the Hawks to a championship. Maybe a 50 win team to a first or 2nd round exit ceiling tops at his peak?  Not a champion. It's pretty obvious that Luka really could lead his team to a championship . That trade means the Hawks will do anything to make the Trae Young leads us to a title narrative happen. Coach is gone now. GM will be gone next. Good players like Collins will be replaced around him but no one in Atlanta will dare question the anointed one. He is that transcendent star that Atlanta has dreamed of You must believe. For Hawks fans sakes I hope Hunter turns into a beat, loved him in college and I hope they can land a big FA to take some of the shine off Trae so he can just hoop and not have to be the messiah."
Pathetic person here - I hope trae young never wins a ring
Who could take average surrounding talent (Brogdon and Turner are good and surrounded by some role players) to be the 10th seed in the East? Looks like Gordon Hayward and Trae Young can for example with imo worse players around them. MEM is 12-11 since Ja came back from his injury and I’d take Turner and Brogdon over Jonas and Brooks.
"Snark is not a rebuttal. I said I highly doubt it but I also never thought Tony would be more of the focal point of the offense after Timmy declined. Trae Young is supposed to be the star that brings the chip. He was traded for Luka. His offensive talent is supposed to be so transcendent that it will cancel out his defensive ineptitude and he will be first player up there holding the Larry O' Brien Trophy. You really think you are ever going to see that? A 6 foot 1 guard with short arms and poor defensive lateral movement, terrible defensive instincts, and inept team defender is going to be up there holding that trophy. Lmao. You think im the nephew?"
Zoomers love Trae though because he is a highlights and stats player. So he has good PR with the young generation where as the rest of us who have been watching the game for decades can see how flawed his overall game is.
"Worst could be Trae Young right now. Really good shooter and passer but the foul baiting, bad defense and average record get held against him so much. Yes his game is flawed but he's not ruining basketball by himself.  Best might be Jokic or Butler. All clips I see are of them balling out or likeable, funny interviews"
"For Trae Young to contribute to a championship team, he would need to play a Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford 6th man role because ultimately that is his skillset. I'll take my downvotes gladly until that day comes. This isn't a Lavine, Booker, or Beal situation where they are below average defenders but great offensive players. They still all have the size and strength to compete at their position. Trae will get eaten alive in the playoffs when teams gameplan to target him."
Trae Young show!
"I'm with you on this one. Don't get me wrong. I think he's a great player, but I don't see how he can be successful in the postseason. Not only do small guys get picked on defensively, but they just get beaten up over a series. The smaller you are, the harder it is to sustain excellence at this level. Look at Kemba. He took a step back at the beginning of the season and was awful. I hope this isn't discredited because of my flair because I really do like Trae Young. He's a great player, but I don't think his game translates to the playoffs.  Having said all that, I don't know that I agree that Dejounte Murray will ever be better. If he is, that's great for him, but I don't see how he could get there."
"I am not convinced that Trae Young is a winning basketball player at the highest levels. I just think that in a playoff series, his terrible defense will always condemn his teams."
"DeJounte Murray is a better overall player and will have a more successful. in terms of wins, career than Trae Young although they will never be mentioned in the same tier. The Spurs have a stud."
you're dumb as fuck if you take trae shai and zion young lmao

"I genuinely feel like it's impossible to say whether he's overrated or underrated, partially because he's still fairly inconsistent and partially because I feel like people's opinions of him are all over the place. I see some people putting him in the same tier as Luka (he isn't), and I see other people saying he's worse than Trae Young (he isn't). For my money, he's pretty clearly a top 20 player in the NBA, and pretty clearly *not* a top 10 player. Pretty damn good for being barely 23, but he's still got work to do.  His defense is for *sure* underrated, though. Guy was borderline All-Defensive caliber last year, and people still think Jaylen is better on that end. Jaylen takes tougher assignments, sure, but Tatum has done a great job when he *does* get matched up against elite wings, *and* he's a fantastic help defender. Part of the reason Jaylen always gets put on the guy who has the ball in his hands the most is because he's pretty much useless off of it."
I wouldn't trade AD for Luka Doncic and Trae Young together tho.
"trae young, demar, simmons, Ja just to name a few who scored 5 points or less in a game this season. U have to remember this was in a WIN and also right after a break. Where are those posts?"
I'm sorry that you guys have Trae young and are still bottom of the barrel nba team.
Trae Young is too small to even compete defensively. You would have to build a whole team around hiding him. The only small guards to ever be the best players on a championship team are Isiah and 2015 Steph. 2015 Steph played a bunch of injured teams that year to win it anyway. Trae will never win 16 games in the playoffs being targeted night in and night out. Booker is a 6 6 shooting guard that doesnt need to be hidden. He is big enough to hold his own and be close enough tl average.
"Trae Young but if Trae Young is your best player, you will never win a championship."
"The best example of Doc's dumbassery.  On the 2nd night of a B2B last against the ATL Hawks:   Doc plays Harrell some of the 1st quarter, all of the 2nd. Then some of the 3rd, all of the 4th. This is the same rotation minute he gave Harrell the night before. We started with a 20+ point lead at the half that was cut short by the 4th. Harrell is getting absolutely abused by Collins. And then he's letting the Hawks backup PG get easy layups. He's clearly gassed. Doc's dumbass decides to never sub in Zubac.  The reporter asks, ""Doc, don't you think it would be a better idea to have Zubac in""  given Zubac's better play on defense and just overall feeling more rested.  Doc responds, "" No, I think we needed the offense."" We were up by fuckin 22 points at the half against a Trae Young-less Hawks."
Trae Young  Kawhi Leonard  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Jayson Tatum  Bam Adebayo  LaMelo Ball  Are the only current players winning an MVP in their careers
Trae Young
"Yeah I agree. Curry has also missed a couple seasons basically, combine that with the fact that like you said he played 3 college seasons and the style of play today and he doesn't have many chances. Mitchell, hield, beal, doncic, trae young all have great chances eventually, and many guys active or not will come out"
Records are made to be broken Trae Young &gt; Curry
Trae Young?
LOL! Zion got to get that Trae young flop package
"Honestly, I don’t think anyone is beating Trae Young 16-0"
Trae Young has a lovely head of hair so I’m not worried regardless.   I pick Olden Polynice.
I swear everyone just wants to ignore how prolific a playmaker Trae Young is. He also has had a higher true shooting percentage the last two years than Fox has ever had.  SGA i see more an argument for because how efficient his scoring has gotten.
"Trae Young is the best player on a team with more wins.      Lonzo is the 3rd best player on a team with less wins.      Seems like you don't really need to ask the question.      EDIT: Now if you're asking about fit ; I think there maybe an argument somewhere where a team would want Lonzo over Trae. But in 95% of cases, I don't think theres even a question."
"Is the team good or bad? If they are bad then Trae Young but if they are already good then I'd probably take Trae Young.  Who would you rather take if you are trying to win games, Ben Simmons or Rodney Hood?"
"Im still taking Trae Young, where is Lonzo's team rn? Right, in the lottery."
Trae Young shouldn’t be ahead of Fox or SGA in any ranking.   Their 2 way ability and efficiency on offense is much better than Trae.
"I know this is basically a click bate article but this doesn't make logical sense.     I could argue pretty strongly that Luka and Trae literally last year as sophomores had 2 historically good seasons. So much so that you could argue, 90% of the people on this list at there *very best* will never have an individual season as good as they just had individually.      So someone is going to really have to explain to me how De'Aaron Fox is higher on this list then Trae Young."
"When I say struggle in the playoffs, I’m not saying they don’t win anything. I am saying that they don’t perform to the same level as they perform in the regular season. There is a slight decrease in quality of production. Again, I don’t think you are understanding what I’m saying. You’re interpreting my statement as me saying Trae is bad. I am not saying that. I am saying that the people on that list rank higher because they should project to be better than him because for the most part they don’t have the same liabilities on defense to the extreme level that Trae Young does. You can claim I don’t watch Trae if you want — that isn’t true though, I try to watch every team in the league and I wouldn’t have commented if I didn’t think I could back it up. Trae is a good player, but he will probably not be as good as 12-10 of those players when it really matters. Now, that may not be what’s most important to a fan base or team. He’s fun to watch, and the team is fun to watch. It definitely gets Atlanta basketball out of the years long rut of just being kind of boring as a product. However, I don’t think he projects to be as impactful a playoff performer. He’s more reliant on foul drawing than those other guards you mention, and historically that does not work quite as well in a playoff setting. But yes, he’s a good player"
They put pretty much every young point guard ahead of Trae
"But if you really want to compare rating stats let’s do that. Of all the guards you mentioned only Lillard has a worse individual defensive rating. However, of the guards mentioned only Trae Young and Ja Morant have a worse offensive rating than their defensive rating. Trae is close (116.3 to 116.2) but it’s still worse. So, my original point was that with how bad he is defensively (and yes he is quite bad) it outweighs his offense at this point enough to be a serious negative in a playoff environment. Small guards struggle in the playoffs, small guards like CHRIS PAUL who is the greatest small guard ever struggle. So, when I claimed that Trae probably is around where he should be on that list, with the idea that playoff success is the ultimate goal of drafting players and building franchises, I don’t think I’m wrong."
Trae “tank” Young 6’1 180
"They've gone too far in not believing in Trae. Hawks were never really healthy all season and showed nice promise for stretches anyway. Team composition still lacks defense and that is bad for Young, but lower than 10-15 seems like an overreaction. His offense is capable of carrying a team to be competitive, coaching and front office have to make the rest work."
"if based on future potential, MPJ is probably highest on this list only behind zion luka and tatum, you can't develop 6-10, he can become the top 5 player in this league, can you say the same for trae young?"
Why would KAT demand a trade from the dubs? Playing with Steph Curry amd Draymond for a chance at a title?  And how many young players are available? I cant really think of many better than eiseman off the top of my head who might be out there. Maybe guys like Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons but they would have shitty picks attached and are both not really on the minny timeline if they trade KAT. They need a lamelo or a trae young or someone 21 and under to pair with Edwards and those picks
Lamelo at 3 vs Edwards at 19 is a crime. I know he hasn’t been efficient yet but the dude is averaging 24PPG recently and if he can get his efficiency up a little bit he’ll shoot up this list.  But then again how Trae Young isn’t top 10 is beyond me.
Trae Young really didn't even make their top 10?
Trae Young this season: 25/4/9 .587% TS 3.4 BPM  Trae Young last season: 29/4/9 .595% TS 3.9 BPM  Drops in his boxscore stats can easily be explained by expanded scoring roles from other players in his team.
"for the mavs i would say probably Trae Young. Not even taking a shot at him, I just think it would be too much of a negative to have him and Luka out there together on defense."
Trae young
James harden and trae young are just unbearable to watch now
"Ben Simmons wayyyy too high, Trae Young wayyy too low, also Jamal Murray is too low as well, feel like his lack of All-Star appearances hurt him, he's been an All-Star caliber player this year when he's not injured and he was a superstar level player in the bubble.   Also just LOL with LaMelo over Tatum."
"He'll be a slower Trae Young. Like Trae, he needs the green light to be effective."
Interesting graph. Also can we just say trae young is just a discount dame this year?
"This is mildly interesting, but it would only eliminate the most exciting and difficult threes: deep and early clock pull ups. Basically you’d be nerfing Steph, Dame, LeBron, Trae Young, Harden, and KD, but wouldn’t be affecting much else because those are the only dudes who take those shots with any kind of consistency. Most threes come off of ball movement that can easily go inside the three point line, or off of a drive and kick, which again happens from inside the line.   If your concern is that there are way too many threes in today’s game because the shot is so valuable, you probably want to target the sort of ball movement threes that your rule wouldn’t affect much, because being good at pulling up off of the dribble is already a rare skill."
"Luka, dame and harden are locks. Steph too assuming he doesn’t miss any more games, if he plays 60+ he’s in, maybe even 1st team still.  That leaves two spots for Booker, Paul, Mitchell, LaVine (probably won’t get it based on record) Beal (same as LaVine) Kyrie (who has missed 15 games) and despite not making an all star team Trae Young could be in there if his team makes a top 5 seed in the east.   It’s crazy, for how deep the west was at guard just a couple years ago, between injuries to guys like CJ, Klay, and Westbrook declining, plus young guys like Ja, SGA, Fox, and maybe Trae not quite being ready yet, guard is not quite as deep as it was when Steph, dame, Westbrook, Kyrie, CP3, and Harden were all arguably top 12 players in the league with 6 guard spots, plus Lowry, Thompson etc etc"
"The Trae Young thing was a joke. It was a meme awhile ago.  I’m pretty sure that the amount of tamofexin in Rogaine isn’t enough to flag a false positive. I fought for YEARS in MMA, and no one was ever flagged bc of Rogaine. People may use it as an excuse, buts I’m fairly sure that’s just bullshit."
Trae Young in shambles
"On a team with Trae Young and John Collins, he is most definitely a role player. A key role player, but a role player nonetheless."
"To be clear, not the one they used to draft Trae young, it was the one they got Kevin heurter with.  Still though,  ill take Kevin heurter over getting ass blasted by the Rockets in the first round"
this dude rly talking about Trae Young when you got the leader in FTA on ur team lmao
Earlier in the year there was an entire thread dedicated to the idea that Dort is worth more than Trae Young. People are crazy.
"He doesn’t even do that as much since going to Brooklyn.  Trae Young,  Embiid, Luka, and Chris Paul are the biggest offenders."
The “Trae Young” rule.
Trae Young is about to average 5 ppg
*The NBA had banned Trae Young for life*
"Obviously it’s gobert, but why is Clint Capela not even being talked about here. It would be a crime If he doesn’t make all defensive 2nd team.   Clint has been the only consist defensive presence in Atlanta, and has been a huge floor raiser for trae young and John Collins on D"
Still don't look half as bad as Trae Young who's still in his 20s
"Casual fans vastly overrate scoring, so this sub tends to focus more on highlighting what casual fans don't.  That said, I don't think guard defense is overrated. It's all about net impact, scoring more points, making the opponents score less, and the difference between guys like Ben Simmons and guys like Trae Young in how much they improve their net impact on the defensive end is *massive*. More than the difference on offense? Eh, debatable, but making general statements like shooting is more valuable than defense is just wrong."
"Did you really think this was a good point? If you swapped Young and Simmons, the Sixers would probably be better LMFAO. If you gave Trae Young a player as good as Joel Embiid and some of the other talent the Sixers have had, the Hawks would've already made the playoffs and this point would be even more ridiculous than it already is."
"People want to point out flaws in players  Trae Young for example is such a valuable player, his defense literally doesn't matter, even if he was elite is not changing anything for the Hawks overall defense but his offense is so valuable when he sits they become literally useless   Like with Simmons, he's just an elite basketball player, all star and All NBA, but shooting, is it a flaw? Yes, but he offers so much"
Trae Young be looking like he's 60's. Definitely not the future-- he's just a reminder of a past where you didn't have shampoo.
"Yes, i just hope that the league puts some clamps down on the foul baiting style of play. Not to blame anyone specifically, but it’s not great seeing the young guys do this constantly (more looking at luka and trae here)"
"In terms of defending 1-5, it’s just a matter of consistently avoiding biting on fakes for Rob because he’s actually really solid at it when he can. He’s had possessions where he’s locked up guys like Trae Young and James Harden when he stays under control, and he forced terrible shots, blocking Harden and Trae’s being way off, because his length is so disruptive for a smaller guy if Rob can stay close."
Mandatory Fuck Trae Young.
Less hype? He was literally compared to lebron. The nba pushed the zion narrative very hard even though luka was outplaying him . Hell zion is even on the nba 2k cover.... Prime were trying to go trae young over luka for rollie if the years when it wasn't even a close debate. Maybe we just get fed different ads but in my experience zion had been shoved in my face way more
I mean just saying “wait until the playoffs to see” is music to a hawks fans years. It’s like everyone saying “Trae young will get exploited in the playoffs” great that means we’re there at least. We haven’t even had 30 wins since Trae was on our team.
"The reporting about LP’s ego management was scary, and stuff is still leaking about his coaching tenure. Trae, John, reddish and even bogdonovich disliked him and though he didn’t know what he was doing. I would be shocked if a team hired him after he managed to piss off an entire locker room of young players and veterans.   Outside of the ego management part, he was also horrible on the X’s and O’s. Every game he would blame the loss on missing open shots or “effort”, yet his offense had almost no off ball movement and he made no defensive adjustments.   Maybe he can learn as an assistant coach and get another shot in 10 years but he was in over his head as the hawks coach. Quite possibly one of the 30 worst coaches in NBA history."
"Trae ""Despite the win"" Young"
"you should've seen one play where he is late to the P&amp;R, but guards Trae young, pushes Baze to guard someone else - and a second later Trae young passes out and Baze gets a steal.  Later Draymond Green executes a PERFECT trap along with Wiggins"
&gt; Losing to the hawks will do that to a person    Losing to ~~the hawks~~ Trae Young will do that to a person.
"forgive me if I'm wrong, but did you just compare lou Williams to trae young"
"Honestly it's necessary. People still have it in their minds that Trae Young is a superstar. Remember when people thought that Lou Williams was better than LeBron James? Oh sorry, that was Trae and Luka."
Trae “despite the win” Young
Trae Young is playing on a bum ankle
Trae Young in tonight’s win. Win it’s right there in the title. I don’t care if he scores zero on 0/30 and we fucking win
Trae “despite the win” Young
"Playing Trae Young, Lou Williams, and Gallo and they put the Hawks in the bonus with 8 minutes to go in the 4th. Idk what the warriors were doing."
Our team needs to get their first so Trae and some of the young guys can get a reality check and improve their game. Trae needs to get more moves when he's in amongst the trees. He can't only rely on the floater and his quickness.
“draymond green is going down on trae young”   😳
"As a fan for trae young, I actually agree with this line of thinking and can appreciate the calculated gamble.   However, the trae young foul bate hate pissed me off when all the great NBA players do shit like that"
not sure if he'll lead the league in steals but he and trae are the only young guys i see right now that can lead the laegue in scoring and passing.
"&gt;Trae Young is the best PG in the draft, leading all draft-eligible players in FPG and second in FPM. However, he struggled down the stretch and his defense and turnover numbers leave a lot to be desired. His ceiling projects as more of a second tier PG at the next level – more Kemba Walker than Chris Paul.  I had him in the top tier in that draft, which consisted of 4 players: Trae, Luka, MPJ, and JJJ.  &gt;I think many people will be shocked to see De’Andre Hunter listed as one of the least safe players in the draft. It basically comes down to how you feel about his defense. Hunter is routinely listed as an elite defender, and he in fact won ACC Defender of the Year. But on tape, he’s just brutally bad. His 1.2% STL this year puts him in the Devin Booker range as a defender. His off-ball defense alternates between lazy and lost. His sense of spacing and angles is pretty much non-existent. His on-ball defense was okay but was largely helped by Virginia’s pack line. I just don’t see it. Maybe he’s the elite defender everybody seems to think he is, and if he is, he’s a valuable player. His offense is rudimentary but more than functional for a defensive specialist. But it’s nowhere near good enough if his defense is as bad as the stats and tape look. I think betting on Hunter to become the first player in recent memory to be an above average defender with a STL% that low is a bad bet.  I had him in tier 4 in that draft, which was post-lottery first round pick. Haven't gotten to watch him this year. Just took a quick glance at his numbers, but other than unsustainable shooting from mid-range (that will regress whenever he comes back), I don't see anything that really stands out."
Oh we getting one of these defensive games from Trae Young tonight then
Trae young/Steph curry comparisons galore on the way! As a Hawks fan this probably never gets old.
"Tyler Johnson has been called Meth Curry before Trae Young was in the league.   Also, I've never heard Young being called Meth Curry."
* Will Barton should be an All-Star even when disregarding offense because of his defensive impact ('20) - this one has to be the worst because it was actually upvoted * Jokic is a stat-padder * AD doesn't contribute to winning basketball * A worrying number of people saying they would rather have Brad Stevens than the #1 pick in the draft * Lu Dort &gt; Trae Young - another upvoted one
"I'd heard that nickname only for Trae Young, didn't realize people use it for Tyler Johnson too"
Him on the Hawks would be a great fit.  He needs a pnr PG like Trae Young.
Straight up a very common take. I love Harden the player but watching him can be annoying just cause he’s being sent to the line all the time slowing the game down. Gets tiring to see so often and why I don’t enjoy watching Trae Young play cause it’s the same thing.
Trae Young
Trae Young averaged 6 3PA/game in his rookie season while shooting 32%
Malcolm Brogdon Paul Millsap Trae Young Tyrese Haliburton Marc Gasol  Winning type unathletic players
"Trae young is 6’1 and “180” and Killian hayes is 6’5 195 pounds.  Listed on nba.com. Why you lying. Plus all I did was look up Killian and see 6’5 195 and was like nope not undersized. This isn’t a debate. He’s 6’5 195 point guard and will get stronger. I’m look at the sky and saying it’s blue and you’re saying no it’s not. This is black and white. He’s not undersized, that was all I was saying. Just go post everywhere that he can’t shoot."
You said he has a strong frame. What's a strong frame? Dude's lighter and taller than Trae Young-- you're full of it.
"&gt; You said he’s undersized.   Yes. And your rebuttal was ""he has a strong frame"".  Tell me. He's taller and lighter than Steph Curry and Trae Young. So who exactly doesn't have a strong frame in the NBA?"
Coming into the league yes. And both are still among the worst defensive players at their position in the league. Trae young might be the worst defensive player in basketball
I’m asking. Does Curry have a strong frame? Does Trae Young?
"Yes. Jokic doesn’t deserve as many free throws as someone like Trae Young or anything, he isn’t drawing an insane amount of fouls, but the amount of insanely obvious ones not called is disgusting. And it’s not like he gets the benefit of the doubt with close cams either."
"I don't think that's super likely. DRob is a specialist. He's got the green light to shoot from 3. He's also in his mid 20s. He's more near his peak than Trae or Doncic (which is scary).  Whereas Trae and Doncic started super young and unless you're top, top talent or on a tanking team, no coach is going to give you the green light to take that many threes."
"yup  he sells calls  Trae young, harden, all these guys do that.  Jokic just plays ball"
Every stat like what? You mean the easy lob threats that pads traes assist that's on hawks? Worse teammates? Lmfao that's debatable. Luka is 100x better play maker than trae young. Fact.
Flashbacks to that one dude who said Joe Harris was better than Trae Young
"Trae young, i’m just not sure if its his face or the soft ass way he plays that I hate more"
"The combined people out from both teams would make a playoff team.  Trae Young, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williams, John Collins, Danillo Gallinari, Cameron Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Josh Hart, Kris Dunn."
Trae Young on here apparently.
I’m not saying he’s a superstar and watch out when he comes back but I’d like to see him more than 7 games. Remember when the whole world wrote off Trae Young when he had a poor summer league. Killian didn’t have a summer league or training camp and thrown in as a starting PG in a new league. I’m giving him more time than what we’ve seen
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"&gt;For tonight’s game at New Orleans: John Collins (left ankle sprain) is out. Danilo Gallinari (left Achilles soreness) is out. De’Andre Hunter (right knee soreness) is out.

"I mean, the Knicks and Timberwolves can use the same defense.  Tanking has obvious advantages, but if you employ the ""if you're not first, you're last"" approach to evaluating teams, then you're necessarily setting yourself up to be championship-or-bust.  While the Hawks have solid pieces on the come-up, I don't think Trae Young is quite good enough to be the centerpiece of a championship roster.  Compared to, say, Philadelphia you don't have nearly the same assets to boast for your efforts.  Moreover, I don't think you guys have nearly the same quality of player development of Toronto, Utah, or San Antonio to forge a winning culture amidst a tradition of losing.  Who knows how things shape out for both teams, but I wouldn't count your chicks before they hatch.  Lots of teams tank and have little to show for it."

"I dont believe in this marketable stuff. Jokic would be marketable but he doesn't have agents, people inside the ESPN/NBA etc to back him up. Denver getting over the LeCommissioner's team and Jokic showing he's much better MVP candidate than Lebron is not desired by some clicks around the league.  Trae Young getting horrendous calls while S.Curry is neglected does not make any sense for marketing either. It must be some other relationship."
"I don’t even understand what the league thinks is marketable anymore. Somehow Steph, one of the funnest players to watch in NBA history, doesn’t “deserve” calls that guys like fucking Trae Young get. And Jokic is one of the best scorers in the league and arguably the best passing big man ever yet refs treat him like he’s some undrafted rookie when it comes to calls."
"That’s what I hate about the league nowadays. The players who actually play to make the shot no matter what are almost penalized for it. I don’t get it, what made Jordan so incredible and fun to watch was that he prioritized making the shot no matter what contact he was taking, but nowadays it’s like the league just wants to prop up the guys who flop instead. Watch the difference between a Trae Young three versus a Steph three. Steph will get hit but make it anyway and the refs won’t give a shit, Trae foul baits and jumps 4 feet sideways into the defender while flinging the ball in the general vicinity of the basket with no attempt of actually making the shot and they’ll call the foul every time. It’s not fun to watch at all."
"MPJ is definitely not the worst defender in the league (Trae Young exists in this universe), and has actually shown some improvement now that he’s been slid up a position on defense. Wiggins is way less efficient, to a point where the numbers aren’t all that comparable. I would have thought some of the advanced numbers in Wiggins would be better considering it seems like he’s playing well this year, but kind of regardless of where you get them (cleaning the glass, 538, second spectrum, NBA adv stats, ESPN adv stats, even bball reference) they’re actually kind of…bad. I think that speaks to the fact that while Wiggins the player has gotten a little better he still isn’t contributing to winning on a team level the way you may think. Give me MPJ."
"I hate it, really hate it, that this is not a foul but, if Trae Young drives into his defender and flops,15 mt away from the basket, he'll get three free throws every damn time"
If Trae Young averaged as many steals as TJ McConnell he'd be leading the league in steals.
"I wasn't referring to Embiid. I was referring to superstars and all stars in general. Specifically, I had KD, Harden, Kyrie, PG, Trae Young, Curry even, etc... in mind."
"You're just being pedantic. When people usually say looking to score, they mean make a shot. Especially contextually of what I just said. Looking for fouls instead of trying to score. Also, getting a foul a doesn't always necessitate free throws. When Trae Young does that back into defenders thing. Luka used to fall when a defender was too close. Those are non shooting fouls. Which the players I listed do as well. All their foul baiting isn't exclusively on shots.  So whether I meant your pedantic way or the way that you should have understood it. Half the players I name flop on defense as well."
Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
They are really deep and can shoot the 3 really well. You have Trae Young scoring a ton and getting a lot of easy assists to Capela and Hueter on the outside. Then you got John Collins banging down low.   It’s crazy how they fired LP and they start doing amazing
I don’t disagree with that i just don’t think it’s fair to use team defense overall to compare the two when the hawks have worse defenders and one of the worst in the league Trae young
"&gt;Jrue &amp; Khris are our closers and they’re better than Bogi at doing so.  Idk if they're better closers. You obviously don't watch Hawks games but Bogi is super clutch. Even with Trae Young on the court, Bogi is the guy making those big 3s with less than 2 mins in the game. Yes, Bogi is not the defender that Jrue is, but he seems to be a better leader and more clutch player. Also Bogi is showing right now that he can lead the offense for a very depleted team and get wins.  With the kind of defensive attention that Giannis gets, it's understandable why Khris Middleton thrives on offense.  Middleton is definitely a bucket getter not denying it, but he doesn't seem to be a great closer. I don't watch Bucks games a lot but I did watch all their games in the bubble playoffs. There are games he just can't close out despite being on the better team."
"Well no. In this case the eye test is not as accurate as stats. Stats can show you exactly how many 3s a player makes from what area of the court. Going by eye test, Trae Young has more range than Durant"
"Lmao bro fr. I honestly get so frustrated playing with warriors cause shots that Steph makes in real life is apparently too fake for 2k, also it bothers me that they have made trae young a better shooter than him"
Trae Young for D'Aron Fox who says no.
"Yes, Trae young is the worst player on this team. Anyone with brain worms can see that"
"Please just stop talking 😭, I guarantee you this team ain’t the 5th seed without trae young"
Trae Young IS the problem lmaooo
Are the Hawks better without Trae Young?
The Hawks are better without Trae no defense Young. Also Budenholzer is still an awful coach if anybody wasn't sure
Trae Young promised everyone making a 3 free drinks tonight
"If I offered immanuel, RJ, Robinson together for any of:  Luka, Zion, tatum, Simmons, Dmitch, dbook, Bam, brown, trae, Ingram, sabonis, ja, shai, fox, lamelo I would immediately be laughed out of a room because all of them are worth more than the Knicks young core combined.  It’s not a good young core.   &gt;mvp candidate  By your definition siakam last year was also an mvp candidate because he got some votes. If siakam was an mvp candidate last year to you, I guess Randle is too?"
Trae Young fellas
"From All Defense to rated worse than Trae Young, my word"
Haven't seen Ant play enough to make an informed call on him but I feel like people simply forget about KAT. He just doesn't seem to get too much media buzz for whatever reason (maybe cuz team has been bad). Trae Young is talked about way more but i'll take KAT over him every day of the week.
Trae Young
Booker turning into trae young
Trae Young being labelled as a bust over like 12 summer league games.
"I think Trae Young is better right now than MPJ, but I don't think it'll be much longer before that changes.  I don't watch every Hawks game so there's definitely more qualified people to talk about Trae, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's already at his overall statistical ceiliing (in terms of scoring and assists), and I don't think his usage could go much higher than it already is.  MPJ has barely played a full season (90 something games I think) and has shown tremendous improvement already, and it really still feels like he's just barely scratched the surface. At this point, he's a walking 20/10 guy, and his only real go-to move is just straight up shooting over guys lol. If he becomes a guy that can handle the ball in the P&amp;R, add a post game and improve his facilitating, he's easily a Top 10 player in the league (obviously, that's a lot of ifs, but still). He also doesn't have the size/athleticism limitations that Trae does, which I think helps a lot too.  Just my 2 cents."
You don’t think trae young could be better than MPJ?
KD shimmy before every free throw.  Trae Young hop after every lob.  Giannis mean mug after every poster.  Curry with the mouth guard chewing.  Lebron with looking down at the ball before every 3pt attempt.  Kemba Walker smile after losing his team the game
Just look at the LeBron and the injury of Trae young
It’s a pasta of the Trae Young post from a few days ago. But he changed it to Luka and the Mavericks
"Dude, its a deleted post, you can stop the downvoting cause it honestly just makes you come off as insecure.  If that was the case, that OP meant the '95 Bulls in literal sense, then its just a stupid question that should be left unanswered.  &gt;Jordan isn't in his prime in 96 so why are using his 87 statline?  What do you mean? When did i use Jordans '87 statline? If you are referring to the 36 ppg on 62% TS that was his statline against Clyde in the '92 finals.   &gt;I have more faith in Clyde than Fucking Longley.  Yeah but neither of them would be able to stop the other either way. I have more faith in Steph Curry guarding prime Shaq than i do in Trae Young, it still wouldn't make any difference, both Hakeem and Jordan would get what they want either way, so its kind of a moot point."
and hawk stans still think trae young is better lmao
"There’s almost 0% chance he’ll make it over some (6/7) group of Steph, Luka, Harden, Dame, CP3, Kyrie, and Mitchell. There’s also Beal, his own teammate who I didn’t mention and who would take votes away too. Also Booker and Trae Young (the Hawks have a much better record), who I didn’t even mention."
Trae young went from bust to perennial All Star within the first month of his career
"I think Trae Young and Ja Morant (if he wins the play in) are somewhat likely, at least compared to other stars.  First time in the playoffs for young PGs has historically been very hard"
"tried to pull the trae young special, or was it the luka special from the beginning"
"LeBron, KD, Giannis, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, AD, Luka, Embiid, Jokic, Lillard, Beal, Tatum, Butler, CP3, PG, KAT, Gobert, Booker, Simmons, Brown, Westbrook, Zion, Murray, Mitchell, Middleton, Kyrie, Trae Young, Lavine, Randle, Bam, Vucevic, Sabonis, McCollum, Ingram, Hayward, Brogdon, SGA, Fox, Lowry, Christian Wood, DeRozan, Holiday, LaMelo, Kemba, D’Angelo, Morant. You’re actually right, he may just be top 50."
"If Trae came into the league in any other context people would be freaking out about him and recognizing him as a historically great young player, but I guess it was decided with the Luka trade that he cannot ever be good   Remember last year when Trae by impact metrics was the worst defensive player to ever pick up a basketball and it was essentially 4v5 with him on the court so no amount of offensive impact could ever erase that?  But then this year Damian Lillard is worse, Kyrie Irving and Ja Morant are equally as bad, and everyone mysteriously forgot about all the defensive impact metrics?"
"Yeah Luka isn't a great defender, but trae young is a black hole on defense and is constantly targeted. You seriously downplaying that part?"
"We just beat the heat without Trae Young or Capela.   Dont think Coach Nate has ever had our best wing, De'Andre Hunter play under him. Reddish is still out. Kris Dunn doesnt exist."
"Everyone who watches basketball knows who Kuzma is. He has more social media followers than Trae Young, Ja Morant, Shai, etc, etc. and a similar amount to Zion and Luka Doncic."
"yes we have thunder double header hawks i think without trae young   bulls with a sick/injured lavine pistons double header with magic. our only ""hard"" games are pels heat spurs pacers which the sixers should at least win 2 if not 3 even 4"
It was pretty funny when it became clear that basically the entire locker room had an issue and the talking heads were saying “well it’s possible that Trae AND John AND Cam AND Bogi AND Hunter are all just young and uncoachable that’s more reasonable than concluding he might have alienated the players”
Trae young and Zion. And it should have happened
"Two things:  -the NBA has a rule (the Stepien rule) where a team cannot trade draft picks in consecutive years. They HAVE to select a player in alternating drafts on draft night. Once they select a player they can then trade their rights to another team but they have to actually make the selection. This is why you see teams doing pick swaps in alternating years to provide more value when trading for a player. The NFL has nothing like the Stepien rule in place.  -Teams will agree to trades ahead of time based on a player being available. In your example, if Pippen was not available for SEA to draft they would not have completed the trade with CHI. Also if MEM had taken Trae Young then the DAL-ATL trade for Luka doesn’t go through"
By little kids he means Trae Young and Lamelo Ball
"True there has been a slight change in his Davidson form and his form now but I think it was more due to speeding up the release and ease for off the dribble shooting (I remember being curious about this a few years ago when I was changing my form but I'll have to confirm).   Also, there is a difference in understanding of what ""low release"" point is. I think Curry's release point isn't too low since he can get a range of shots off that a ""true"" low release point shooter (e.g. Trae Young, Ja Morant, Steve Nash) would not be able to get off. I mean come to think of it - does Damian Lillard truly have a release point higher than Curry? I wouldn't say so but Lillard isn't considered to have a low release point.  I state all this to say there's a lot of nuance to all this re: release point since it depends on whether the shooter is a one-form shooter or a two-form shooter (or even a 1.5 form shooter). Two form shooters tend to have high release point since they jump on their jumpers (Kobe, Ray Allen) and one motion shooters have lower release points since they don't jump much on their jumper (Curry, Harden). It is all pretty fascinating and your comment has me thinking once again about all the details that go into shooting."
I think you could argue that at least those players received a somewhat similar level of praise along with the hate.  I mean both have won MVP. I don’t think there is any stat line Trae could realistically put up where he would win MVP because Le Defense can be activated as a trap card during any Young talk.
For some reason trae young gets more superstar calls than steph curry
"I can't say much about Embiid, but Trae Young has mastered the Harden bullshit of jumping into defenders and contorting himself whenever possilble to get 3 FT's  Tbh, I think the NBA would be a better place if Trae, Harden, and Embiid had their FTA's lowered down to the level of Steph and Jokic instead of raising Steph's and Jokic's up since there's enough fake foul BS already."
"Nahh..I love Ja but clearly you take Curry, Kyrie, CP3, Lillard, and Luka over him...and that's not even mentioning other guys like Trae, SGA, Simmons, Fox, Jrue, etc. We can respect Ja as a great young player without getting ahead of ourselves with hyperbole."
"It was really weird seeing relatively young nba media people acting like old boomers saying  “Well you know you have to WANT to be coached, these young players they just want to be coddled”   Like wtf sorry Adam Schlect but I’m pretty sure Trae Young knows if a coach is gonna help him win basketball games or not better than you."
His Trae Young stance is so odd. I feel like Trae is slowly starting to play a more inclusive style too
Unbiased opinion   MVP - Trae Young  DPOY - Clint Capela  6MOY - Lou Williams  MIP - Brandon Goodwin  COY - Nate McMillan  ROY - Onyeka Okongwu
"&gt; but I guess a lot are new Trae young fans  New Trae Young fans? The Trae talk at the beginning of the season should've turned pretty much all of them away, if there were even that many new ones to begin with."
"LaMelo Ball and Trae Young did that. They’re good, but are they as good as Steph?  Seriously, Steph has genetics, training and an IQ that allow him to do what he does. Just because he’s not a freak like specimen like Gobert doesn’t mean its simply a matter of “practice till you shoot like Steph freaking Curry” lol"
You'd think Hawks fans have been humbled enough to not be this cocky but I guess a lot are new Trae young fans who haven't learned.
Call out Trae Young without calling out Trae Young
I don’t care what the situation is. You don’t lose to a hawks team missing Trae Young and Clint Capela if you’re a playoff contender. Also give more minutes to Iggy putting up a goose egg than Tyler Herro.
trae young got less hair on his head than i do on my testicles
ESPN: *why Trae Young being the 16th best player under 25 was still too high*
"Love talking about form. I've personally changed my form many times throughout high school, depending on which senior I wanted to emulate the most. I hate my left thumb with a passion lol  I think one reason for this trend is that basketball camps for younger kids don't have a block of time focused on form. While the old mentality was ""this is the best form, everyone do this"", the new mentality is ""do whatever you want, just perfect YOUR form"".  This might sound boomer of me, but I'm only 21. When I went to basketball camps in middle school, the first 15-20 minutes every day was dedicated to one hand shots at close range. We would focus on our follow through, high arc, and swishing every shot. BEEF was the way to go. UBC T-Birds camp btw.  The best example in my opinion is pre-NBA Lonzo Ball. No semblance of old-school proper form except maybe his feet alignment. But he kept that form from a young age and developed his own game around his shooting mechanics. That left step back that he was famous for at UCLA? 100% unstoppable because the defender had to go across his body to contest it, and by that point there's a good chance of a foul.  Even Trae Young and other chest-shooters like Lamelo Ball. Release is too low for the old school way of thinking. Right elbow isn't 90° at all. But he developed his step back and quick release to accomodate for his easier-to-block shot.  I think it's changed for the better. We get to see way more innovation in how players move on the court. Sure, there's picture perfect players like Klay Thompson, but the fact that his form is so textbook makes him stand out even more."
would average 70 if he got the calls trae young got
1. Aleksej Pokuševski of the Okinawa City Thunder 2. Charles Barkley of Inside the National Basketball Association 3. Paul Pierce of the Washington Bullets 4. Jacques De Gautier of the Quebec Castor 5. Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks
You probably think Clint Capela &gt; Trae Young too. Keep wins shares watching casual
"agreed. someone posted a stat the other day that said he was shooting better from 3 this year than trae young, which blew me away. he's a bonafide franchise player."
"Since 2011-12, there has been an increase in scoring every season. There has also been an increase in pace every season. Rule changes have allowed players to score more, and made it harder for defenders to guard them. How are defences better today, when players are scoring more, and teams are conceding more?  Defence and physicality are inextricable. You look at every strong defensive team in history, and they all have at least one physical player.  We don’t have that anymore because any contact is a foul. Tony Allen, an elite perimeter defender, wouldn’t even be able to play today because of his physical style of play. Players like Trae Young or Harden get half their points from baiting defenders to touch them so they get FTs. Grit and toughness have been out ruled in favour of high high scoring games.  Draymond Green is probably the best defender of this decade. Here’s a quote from him: “Defense isn’t really an emphasis anymore in this league. So I think you’re seeing it all around the league with these high scores. We know what the emphasis is.”"
"My favorite player is LeBron, and I've liked him ever since he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine like 20 years ago. But I would advise you not to be a LeBron stan.  Here's some young and exciting players that I love to watch:   \- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City** \- Crafty young point guard with an all-around skillset   \- **Lamelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets** \- Great passer and playmaker, and still super young   **- Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies -** Explosive athlete, a point guard who plays above the rim   **- Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings -** Smooth, reliable guard who plays like a veteran  Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young are all really good and young, but they already get lots of fanfare."
"I don't think these guys are saying he's undeserving tbh. They have a different guy (namely Embiid) as being *more deserving* to them. Jokic isn't going to be a unanimous MVP. At the same time, it won't be close. For every voter who thinks Embiid has been the MVP despite his missed games, there are three more who basically disqualified him when he got hurt. The argument of whether that should be the case makes for good TV, but I'm not telling you what things should be I'm telling you what they are. I could make a good case for Embiid and you could make one for Jokic. Those are our opinions, but the *fact* is he *will* win. (technically it's not a fact yet but it will be so I'm calling it a ""pre-fact"").   If I were Nuggets fans I would just be celebrating the rest of the season. The race is over and honestly that's quite rare outside of Steph's unanimous MVP season. I understand thinking you're being disrespected by some media members but you guys have to remember that getting on TV and everyone saying Jokic is the MVP isn't a segment it's two minutes of agreeing. That might work for Jokic local pregame show but that's not gonna cut it for Mr. Mouse and ESPN. So they will continue on with the ""debate"" knowing full well it has already need decided. The straw poll confirms what everyone on this sub knew as soon as those guys got hurt, there is no longer a race. I have no interest in arguing who would win if Embiid never got hurt seeing as how too many people have DQ'd him for it to matter. So yeah, I'd just enjoy it.   Also Jokic isn't a good defender overall to me but he is a good post defender and the people that say he's the worst defender in the league have clearly never heard of Trae Young."
"You could make your point without underselling Brook Lopez as a stretch 5. He's at .355 from three this year, not .310  That's the difference between Russell Westbrook and Trae Young."
Maravich barley even gave effort on defense.  Offensively with the Jazz he was kinda a chucker and would have to likely take way less shots today if he wants to be a + on offense.  Trae Young is a (somewhat) efficient scorer but what really makes him good is his playmaking ability what Maravich didn’t have
"Trae young doesn't do that too much either, so I don't see how Maravich would be too different. Can you please explain why you think he needs to work on those?"
"Roids. I agree. Trae Young is also about half my age. But this is not a two or three weeks thing, at least not for a shifty guard. If he’s playing OG for the Falcons, maybe the timeline makes sense."
"This is the most important part of the issue. I fully understand Chuck's ""I'm not your role model"" stance and I agree with him, but when you're straight up living recklessly and putting others at risk, it's just plain stupid.     I'm sure these young dudes feel like they're untouchable like a lot of late-teen early-20s guys do, but with the extra sort of ego boost that can come with knowing your about to be making tons of money in the NBA. It can be a recipe for disaster, and while it didn't end poorly for Trae, it most certainly did for Terrance, and it's awful."
"Lots of people like other young guards like Booker, Tatum, Trae, and Ja and have decided that to like their favorite guard they have to go after every other young guard in the league to protect their honor.  People also like to spout about stuff like empty stats because he has league average TS% despite him being the leading scorer on the #1 team in the NBA this season. And Look! When he's not being asked to foot most of the scoring and creating responsibilities, like a few years back, his shooting and efficiency go up. Wild."
I'm glad people bullied Trae young into wearing his seat belt while he streams on IG Live.  You're on top of the world and think you're untouchable **until** something happens.
"Trae is tradable. I don’t know why they would. They built a young, promising core around him. But I think he’s one of those guys who could be dangled if a superstar became disgruntled somewhere. If Brooklyn doesn’t work out or if the Sixers underperform again and one of their two says they want out. I could see him being a piece to make that deal work.  Zion, I completely agree with you. His ceiling is limitless."
Trae Young has entered the chat
All nba defense level dude being a key player on a team with Trae young is laughable to you.  Why do I continue to check these threads.
1. Aleksej Pokuševski of the Okinawa City Thunder 2. Charles Barkley of Inside the National Basketball Association 3. Paul Pierce of the Washington Bullets 4. Jacques De Gautier of the Quebec Castor 5. Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks
She's trying to draw a foul. Learned it from Trae Young.
Meanwhile Trae Young averages more free throws per game.
"Bro LA always gets the stars DEAL WITH IT. We are were players want to be, when Lebron retires we'll probably get someone like Trae Young when he's tired of losing in Atlanta and wants some fame."
"Jeff Stotts, Injury Expert, (@InStreetsClothes):  &gt; Re: Trae Young: The average missed time for Grade 2 lateral ankle sprains this season in the NBA has been 18 days (8 games).  &gt; https://twitter.com/brad_altman/status/1385369514024443905?s=21  If that timetable holds true, he would miss 9 games and could be back for the last 4 games of the season (Wash, Wash, Orl, &amp; Hou)"
Julius Randle has made more 3s this year than Trae Young.   On 35 fewer attempts.
Dude I just saw a post yesterday saying that trae young has a mvp case
I would say Trae Young
"It has, for example trae young, hawks defense has improved so traes defensive statistics have improved too, he might not even Be bottom 20 anymore, don’t get me wrong he’s still pretty bad but his defense has gotten better a decent bit this year. Same thing with booker he’s better on defense since two years ago"
Trae Young
"Trae Young gets a lot more minutes, but per possession it's gotta be Boban"
Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell being listed as the same height doesn't feel right.
"Trae Young is 5'7"" 110 lbs as far as I know."
"Trae Young, Bam Adebayo, Fred VanVleet, Gordon Hayward, Jerami Grant, Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler  There were a lot of really good snubs. Tobias Harris isn't clearly ahead of that pack. Trae Young should have been next up if anything."
Silver already stepped in by injuring Trae Young 😔
Chris Paul &gt; Nikola Jokic &gt; Westbrook &gt; Trae Young(never watched) = Ben Simmons(never watched) = LaMelo(never watched) &gt; Lebron James.
"Agreed, the rule's gotta go immediately. Seemingly every game it seems like a new guard decided to pick up that dribble in front and stop move .. started with Dwyane Wade years back but now it's everyone from Trae Young to fucking Campazzo lmao"
I'll give you that Trae Young is a BITCH
"I don't know what the hell was going on last night. Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, Trae Young, Clint Capella.... everyone got hurt.  Hope Trae's okay. Had he played the whole night there's a very good chance this game has a different result. I thought we were going to have to bust out Frank Ntilikina to at least try and defend him."
or because 2015-2016 Harden was Trae Young levels of bad on defense. Harden's actually been good since his MVP season but that season he was easily one of the worst defenders

The knicks' best defender was out (Mitchell Robinson) and our starting 3 was out as well (Burks) lmao. The game was still close before trae young went down too. This is just straight up delusional. They may be more stacked but you can't discredit 3 straight wins over them. I can give you just as many reasons why the knicks were at a disadvantage today. We were on the 2nd game of a b2b and we had like 5 games this past week.   See? Playing the excuse game is fucking dumb when they lost 3. IN. A. ROW. To us.
"This is how I know you don't watch much, and I'm not even a Harden fan. It's just being an objective basketball observer, Embiid is selling contact and flopping with the best of them, he'll rip through and throw his arms up with little attempt trying to make the shot. And you can't talk foul hunting without Jimmy Butler. Dude had entire games last year where he'd hunt Fts and act like he got snipped when drawing contact. You also have Trae Young who's pretty blatant with it."
Jules drops 40 a game on the Hawks. Stop Trae Young and Capela &amp; the Hawks ain't shit
"Knicks are a really good team and it's fun to watch them be competitive. The young teams in the East -- Hornets, Hawks, and Knicks -- are going to be scary for a while and they're just getting started.   But man, Hawks were up 8 and were in control for the majority of the game until Trae goes down. It was competitive for sure but Hawks were looking really poised to win this game."
"Its cool and cool idea   I was confused about what the video was actually going to be about   Based on the title   I was thinking   Better than what?  Skimming thru, I heard you say 'regular season'  That makes sense but should prob go in the title   I know you might be restricted on the length of the title   Audio quality is good-ish but having GREAT audio is generally pretty easy I think   Just pay for a real microphone, etc.  Duncdon guys esp Nate always hypothesizing that Trae Young will be garbage in the playoffs   Would be cool if you could predict his performance in playoffs, publish your model, then do a video after to look at accuracy, anomalies, etc.  What I'm _really_ interested in is predicting and preventing injuries   We need a gd breakthru there -- in part because as high tech as our medical knowledge at the pro level is supposed to be, watching these injuries happen somehow feels predictable   It _must_ be predictable, im convinced   Think of that NYT article today talking about how icing injuries actually slows healing   What????  ...ps maybe the video could be split, but how long does it take to say ""Jimmy's stats are up in the playoffs""? There might be no there there."
"The defence hardly forced it, that's where we disagree completely   He had Trae Young infornt of him at half court, Russ has to exploit that   He holds up and looks for teammates (admittedly they were all trailing) but at that point you have to go at Trae    Trae's either forced to foul, give up a much better look or the help defence collapses and kick out to one of the guys trailing the play  - Much higher percentage play that just chucking up an off the dribble 3 with 3.5 seconds left"
"Hard disagree, hardly the best play he could make, let's be honest we all knew it wasn't going in   He hardly got ""walled"" he had trae young to his right and bogdanovic to his left and slowed down from mid court   We're talking about potentially the most explosive athlete in the league and he doesn't try blow by the worst defender in the league (Trae) and go baseline?"
That’s why we 3-0 y’all bitch ass. Immanuel Quickley sonned Trae young in the first game and D-Rose sonned Trae in the second two. Bums
Lmao he has Trae Young in front of him and he pulled up instead of just going through/past him.
"Lately, you can live with giving Trae Young all the shots from three he wants. Just don't give the slightest appearance that you're touching him to the refs."
"Trae young has one of the best floaters in the nba, forcing him into long floaters with drop coverage is not good defense."
Live in ATL. At the game tonight. Westbrook is awesome. But Trae Young won that game!
"""Scott Brooks, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Kings game. You need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win.""  --an idiot"
"*insert white player here* really plays at his own pace. Incredible shot. Better Han Trae young. Reminds  me of my old dog, ruphus. Also I’m an excellent driver and here’s thirty minutes   of my daughter talking."
Trae Young always gets dumb shit calls so players don't even touch him while other players on the court do not get the same treatment.
If he had Trae Young jersey on then he'd get the FT
"Nobody likes the Hawks tho, beating trae “Hitler Jr” young in the playoffs would not make them a villain. Knicks would keep their lovable underdog status against most teams in the east, especially since they don’t have a superstar for ppl to direct their hate towards or cause controversy.  The internet usually roots for maximum embarrassment. As long as its more embarrassing for guys like Embiid, Durant, and Giannis to lose to the knicks than it would be for the knicks to flame out of the playoffs, this sub will be behind them."
"Hell of a game from Russ, honestly that last possession was on Scott Brooks. Should've called a timeout after the turnover.   Speaking of Scott Brooks, looking how the Wizards attempted to handle Trae, [it's almost like Scott Brooks got his gameplan from this redditor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n8z930/scott_brooks_there_is_a_way_to_beat_the_hawks/)   &gt;stop the Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win.  The result? Yeah Trae had less assists, less threes, but the man who already leads the league in floaters feasted in the mid-range for 36. This is usually what teams try to do to stop Trae, and this is usually the result."
Trae Young alone had two more FTs than the Wizards as a team.
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"Trae Young in the paint &gt; Trae Young at the arc  He needs to be a pass first guy out there because he's got Bogi, Gallo and Huerter out there and yet teams still double him to get the ball out his hands at the 3pt line Give them what they want and let an actual efficient 3pt shooter shoot"
No. Trae Young is putting up better numbers than him and is actually on a winning team yet no one is considering him for All-NBA
Trae Young had 2 more free throws than the entire Wizards team combined.
Trae young gets this call everytime lol
Trae Young tonight for reference 36 PTS on 50/14/100 9 Assists 6 Rebounds
"Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock the Hawks beat my Wizards tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. How the fucking fuck does that foul-baiting lolipop-haired rat Trae Young beat Russel BEASTbrook? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a league to believe in. I want Russ to get more tiple-doubles and fix this broken league. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, he was supposed to break the record and win tonight???? This is so fucked."
"Scott Brooks, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Kings game. You need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
Trae young? More like Trae old
Does trae young even know who he is though ?
I’m gonna tell my grandkids beaker from Sesame Street went onto play for the hawks but changed his name to trae young
Trae Young has more FT's than the entire Wizards team
"No, if you are gonna bring up Westbrook you gotta start talking about Trae Young"
"Weird, my friend from Oklahoma hated Trae Young back then and still hates him to this day."
Trae Young will be exposed as a playoff liability. He will be hunted on defence and there is no one on the Hawks good enough on D to save him.
"Stop it, Trae young the truth."
I swear anytime I watch trae young I feel disgusted. Bro really just gets fed calls from the refs
"While Russ was getting his MVP, Trae Young was in his senior year at Norman North and setting Oklahoma high school ball on fire. Now he’s playing against him tonight, of all nights. As a native okie, feels pretty good"
"We can’t go wild in FA anymore, we’ve got to resign the good young players we have. Jc is gonna get a lot, Trae is a sure fire max, Huerter will probably get 10-15 mill, hunter will demand a lot as well. All in the next 2 offseasons"
I remember when everyone was calling Trae Young a bust in the first half of his rookie year
Trae Young?
Trae Young  Trae Young will without a doubt pass Steph
What’s Trae young at? That’s the guy that comes to mind as a potential future record breaker.
"Bill's been a lot higher on the Hawks ever since Trae Young was out. It's like Ewing theory except Bill probably doesn't even think that Trae is good enough to count as a Ewing. He's pretty much blamed him for making Collins mad, for stunting Bogdan's stats, and for being the poster child of selfish basketball."
Bill Simmons' most hated player lineup:  PG: Trae Young  SG: James Harden  SF: LeBron James  PF: AD by default I guess? He hated on him plenty through the trade  C: Dwight always and forever
"Only until Trae Young fouls out, Wizards lose 100% of games where opposing star players foul out  If you want to win, have Trae foul out in the first minute of the game"
Trae Young can very likely go off on us.   I’ll be super happy if Knicks get out of first round and keep all games competitive but I don’t think we have much of the talent to go further   And not to mention the only ones with any playoff experience is Rose and Taj
Trae young cannot be put on Westbrook it’s not a knock on trae but that’s asking a mouse to defend a cobra
"This is expected with someone of his caliber. His team is really suffering from his careless antics. Racking up technical fouls, and now getting ejected from a game for a Flagrant 2 foul is not becoming of a number 1 option. They probably wish they had Trae Young at this point, lol."
Trae young
*proceeds to get killed by Trae Young pull-ups and floaters*
If defence and offense were equally important Matisse Tybulle would be as good as Trae Young
Trae young pick and rolls are basically unguardable. If it was as simple as playing drop coverage then everybody would do it  Good thing Russ is gonna drop a 30 point triple double and lead us to a win anyway though!
"Height boost: Trae Young. 6’4 Trae with his skill would be the best offensive guard in the league, easy  Athleticism boost: bogdan bogdanovic, if he had a great first step and dunk-in-traffic ability he and Trae in this scenario are the most potent backcourt in the league, up there with prime Steph and Klay  Skill boost: Cam reddish. He is the one player on the roster with all the tools: height, natural talent, length, instincts: if his actual skill level catches up to his body he’s a top two way player in the league easily   Sigh, if only this were real"
"""Rampage"" Yeah you caught me I'm actually a part of Luka's personal PR team OBVIOUSLY lmao. I've got like a grand total of like 4 comments on the subject that you've got over a dozen, if anyone's going on a rampage it's you... Wait a second I see what's going on here, I can't believe I didn't peep the Hawks flair this whole time, I get it now it all makes sense, I just wanna let you know if this was Trae Young I'd feel the same way."
"3 inch boost- Trae Young (6 ft 4 would make him insane)  Skill Boost- John Collins (great finisher, but him learning how to dribble and finish would be insane)  Athleticism Boost- Bogdan Bogdanovic (sniper, but imagine he had insane athleticism to get around guys)"
lol trae young gets more respect from the refs than lebron does
1. Trae Young 2. Clint Capela 3. DeAndre Hunter
15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young 17. Mikal Bridges 18. Domantas Sabonis 19. Anthony Edwards 20. Deandre Ayton 21. Tyrese Haliburton 22. John Collins 23. Jarrett Allen 24. Lonzo Ball 25. Collin Sexton
Trae Young is the only person that doesn’t know Trae Young is going bald.
"Some funny notables:   Trae Young #33, Davion Mitchell #63, and Luka Garza at #100"
Lol. None of that would have made him worse. And Curry's recent lower PPG seasons were because he had KD so his usage was way down. Last time he didn't he dropped 30.1PPG. And before then he was taking fewer than 10 3PA per game.  Curry was never going to have a worse season than Trae Young.
Because nobody likes to watch trae young lol he’s a foul baiting bitch. Big difference
"You're just wrong. Mostly because you clearly just don't understand how massive a gulf there is and was between Trae Young and Steph Curry. Curry would have to fall so massively far back or Young would have to jump so massively far forward that assuming such a thing would happen was always completely absurd. Like, under a 1% chance kind of absurd."
"This is a really bad take. Luka isn't Ben Simmons, but he isn't Trae Young or Dame either. He can also go long stretches where his defense is legit good. Dame simply can't say that.   Be that as it may, even if you say Luka is putrid on defense, what does that make Dame? Putrid plus? Vomit-worthy? I mean there is zero debate that Dame is a whole level of worse on defense than Luka."
"Trae young went to my high school. His hair looked that shitty when he was 14, he might be alright"
"I mean, it's not even in the stratosphere of being fair. Trae isn't even a particularly great shooter. Trae Young attempts 1 more three per game than Steph makes per game. And he just doesn't even shoot them all that well."
Trae young I mean it's kinda obvious 🤷🏾‍♂️
lol no it is not fair to assume that Trae Young would be better than stephen fucking curry stop it
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
Lol y’all remember that dude who said Steph would be a shell of his former self this season and Trae Young would surpass him as the better player? 😭😭😭
A reminder that Trae Young had 30/9/4 on 60%TS his sophomore season
"You're right, but from what we've seen so far I'd imagine he's going to hit a lot of the necessary bench marks. I don't know if many people are watching Grizzly games outside of Memphis but on most nights it looks like his creating is up there with Westbrook, Harden, Simmons, and Trae. Watching him run an offense is pretty slick. His shooting can improve a bit and his defense a lot.   As team they seem to struggle down the stretch every once in a while but that's a young team issue (and why I thought they were better off with Crowder. He brought a fire to their defense and a spark on offense on the right night)."
"Sure, but I think the offensive output that Trae Young has shown this year, is something to consider. He has shown that you can win with him as your best player, whilst almost averaging 25-4-10. Offensively he is a bit better than Mitchell in my opinion. On top of that, the reason why Utah is a good defensive team has mainly to do with Gobert and not with Mitchell."
"Butler is at a forward spot, so Mitchell couldn't fit in there. Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young are really close and I wouldn't be surprised if Mitchell made it over Trae."
Mitchell is a much better defender than trae young tho
"I’m assuming you are asking me about Trae Young vs. Donovan Mitchell?  If so, yes…record means a lot. But also, Trae Young isn’t a great defender and I expect the scoring to be higher because Atl has less options"
I do think theyd be better with Trae but defense would be considerably worse swapping a DPOY candidate with Trae Young.
"Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell are incredibly close, however, I went with Trae Young because he puts up only 1 point less than Spida whilst also averaging almost 9.5 assists per game. This is second in the league only behind Westbrook. Trae Young is also a little bit more efficient and the Hawks have been playing really well since Nate McMillan has arrived. I could see the case tho for Donovan Mitchell, considering the Jazz have the best record in the league.  On the CP3 vote, I think Kyrie and CP3 are at the same level, however, Steph, Luka, and Dame clearly have been better than CP3 this season. Luka is carrying a Mavs team to the 5th seed with so many games by teammates missed due to protocols and injuries. Steph is the nr 2 or nr 3 MVP candidate imo, with Jokic being far ahead of the competition as nr 1. Lillard has dragged a Portland team to the 6th seed with his best teammate being out for a long time. The stats of these 3 are way better than Paul's stats. That combined with their situation and importance to their team, clearly puts those 3 ahead of CP3 for me."
"Mostly agree with OP picks, but a couple exceptions…   I gotta put Chris Paul on the first team because he is my pick for MVP. Also, I’d put Donovan Mitchell on the 3rd team over Trae Young."
Trae young 29/4/9 on 59% TS but no one ever wanna talk about that
"You guys would have the best record in the league if you swapped Simmons and Trae. You would be championship favorites, Trae Young and Embiid PnR would be completely unguardable in the postseason and the spacing Trae would give Embiid is pretty nuts. Embiid would average 40 and Trae would average 25 and 12 lmao.   Defense would be marginally worse, still top 10 in the league."
"LeBron  Kawhi  Giannis  Curry  KD  Harden  AD  Luka  PG13  Dame  Jokic  Tatum  Embiid  Butler  Beal  Westbrook  DBook  CP3  KAT  Bam  Mitchell  Murray  Simmons  Kyrie  Zion  Trae Young  Middleton  Brown  Jrue  Fox  Randle  Shai  LaVine  Vucevic  Demar  That’s 35 guys with a solid step on him.  Then you got guys like Siakam, Tobias Harris, Wood, Brogdon, etc. we’re depending on who you ask they may also be higher.  He ain’t top 30, and he is not on Ben Simmons level."
"trae young, chris paul, deaaron fox, conley, ball, mcconnell, and more are much closer to what a PG does"
"Luka, Zion, Ja, JJJ, Ant, LaMelo, Trae. League is in very good hands.  I have half a mind to throw a lot of our young guys in there too and Haliburton who has been really impressive all year"
You forgot Trae Young too.
"Trae Young, a top 3 playmaker in the NBA, was the most doubled player in the league last year"
"I know they aren't the most common, but that's what makes them special. Them being more uncommon still has people discussing Steph's shooting. People think of 3 people when it comes to those shots: Dame, Steph, and Trae Young. The convo will always circle back to Steph though because people see him as the main person that's taken those shots."
trae young didnt deserve to be an all star right?

Damian Lillard and Trae Young - defense
"My East team this year is the Hawks, lots of overlooked talent on that team, very deep, and I’m a big Trae Young and Clint Capela fan. In the West, I like the Jazz just to shut up all the people calling them frauds and the Mavs because my buddy is a big Luka fan.   If I had it my way though, the Wizards would sweep the Nets on the way to Russ’ first ring."
Trae Young exists  And Luka
Trae young begs to differ.. Also dame probably gets too many calls on his jump shots but the refs swallow their whistles when he drives cause that dude gets hacked without calls week in and week out
"I have a hard time seeing Trae Young as ""tall"" but the dude is."
"&gt; The young guys we have coming, Zion, Ja, Trae, Cade etc are closer in skill to the elite euro prospects than ever before. The gap between US and other countries is closing tremendously and very quickly  What European country team has that amount of level in their team? There can be 6 other guys with great talent in Europe, but if every one of those plays for a different team, that doesn't mean much.  Giannis is a great player, but him plus his brothers and other roleplayers won't be a match for the US.  &gt; That’s best case scenario. I would be willing to bet a lot of money that LeBron and KD are done with the Olympics. Steph is getting older too and that’s a huge commitment. LeBron and KD haven already won multiple medals.  Let's see what happens in the olympics, even LeBron has said that he wants to play specially if Pop is the coach. Even if you selected players that never played in the Olympics you would have a better team than any other country:  Dame - Jrue - Tatum - Zion - Bam  And players are much more willing to play for the US team in the olympics rather than the FIBA WC."
"I mean see this is exactly the point I'm making. You haven't seen it so you just assume it's projection and crying over nothing.   If Luka got hit even *once* as hard as Zion gets hit on a daily basis this sub would have to shut down from all the racist shit y'all would all be spewing because the precious White Savior wasn't getting his fair share.   It makes sense you'd hate what I'm saying though, since Luka is in that same group with Harden and Trae Young. Just flops his way through the game. Just FYI, last year Luka took about half the shots in the paint that Zion is this year, and still averaged more free throws.   Any way you analyze it it's ridiculous."
"Initiating contract doesn't matter if the defender is in illegal defensive position lol. Trae young and Harden ""initiate contact"" jumping into their defenders and are league leaders in foul calls; why shouldn't the player who leads the entire league in paint scoring not get the same or better courtesy? ""He already gets a lot of calls"" isn't an excuse for the refs missing or refusing even more obvious ones btw."
"Lmfao and all of them are unfounded and total bullshit. Except for this one.   Zion takes more shots in the paint than *anyone*, **ever**. But he doesn't get officiated that way. He's 10th in the league in free throw rate (that's behind bench players like Drew Eubanks btw). He's behind Trae Young in free throw attempts per game.   And of course you're going to think ""Well every team says all this shit, everybody just wants their best chance of winning"". But it's not like we're all complaining about some little tik tak pussy ass fouls here. Zion is getting absolutely clobbered in the paint on a very consistent basis and just never gets those calls.   Y'all just don't want any other team to have any sort of perceived advantage so you call it bullshit and say it's the same for everyone. But seriously man, go watch some Pelicans games from this year. Zion gets to the line a lot, but it's not nearly proportional to the amount he's actually fouled. And I don't expect him to get *every* single foul call. None of us do, because that's unrealistic and that doesn't happen for anyone. But if it was called at the rate even for other stars he'd be so far ahead of everyone else, because he's **fouled** more than everyone else. Plain and simple. We don't want an unfounded advantage. We just want it to all be fair. If the other team is fouling our guy at a disproportionate rate, then it should be called that way. Why can Harden and Trae Young go out there, shoot 15 threes a game, and get more calls than a guy who is doing historic things in the paint with historic amounts of contact?"
"ya, the trae young scoot back called everytime. driving zion body contact, is just good defense"
"Also if you’re going with a point guard, I don’t get how trae young and Zion would somehow be a better combination than Zion and Steph curry"
Blocked by trae young and making tacko fall look like Hakeem send his ass to Lithuania.
"I found it funny that Curry managed to draw like 4 fouls on him when foul baiting isn't really part of his game, but Trae Young wasn't able to draw a single foul on him in multiple matchups when he's much more proficient at baiting defenders."
"Just because another player helps the team win *more* doesn’t mean the first player wasn’t helping the team win. If you trade Harden for Trae Young, do the Hawks get better and the Nets get worse? Sure. Doesn’t mean that Trae isn’t a valuable player, just means Harden is *more* valuable. And we’ve seen this year in Phoenix that Chris Paul is incredibly valuable to teams regardless of who he’s replacing"
Trae young and Fox
Wasnt there a few weeks or months ago where a player (I think Trae Young) tripped over the foot of his defender and got a foul?
"It's funny that Trae Young and the vitriol he recieved in New York hasn't been brought up. He handled it by snatching the soul out if an entire city, smiling. Kyrie scores 39 while KD and Harden are doubled and acts like he shits ice cream afterwards."
"Same as, not all, but a handful of Knicks fan mad about Trae Young. Like you got playoff basketball back in MSG, you got to chant “F you” to the other teams best player, you got your villain to hate, is this not what you’ve dreamed of for the past decade? (minus the outcome of the series so far)"
"Trae Young is looking great this playoffs. He really shows why you need a superstar in the playoffs, Atlanta always has him to go to for a bucket or a great feed while NYK has no one to turn to."

Oh I’m not....I just really don’t like kyrie lol. Dude is a baby back bitch. What I do love is when they let animosity play out during play off games. I now like Trae young after the last couple games.
"I kind of love the fact that we have genuine hatred and rivalries building in this league(luka vs clippers, trae young vs knicks, kyrie vs celtics, Dillon Brooks vs whichever fanbase he plays) so as a neutral observer im all for of these types of acts lol."
"The super rich aren't gonna throw water bottles and pop corns at players, as bad as some of them may be. They typically enjoy different a sort of vices. This is more of rowdy sports fans who think this is what the game needs and that it's up to them to bring the atmosphere back after the pandemic break. Like seriously, what big executive is gonna survive the shame of spitting on Trae Young? In their world, that's usually a bigger deal than having shot people."
did u add in Jevon Carter and leave out Luka Doncic and Trae Young?
"Speaking of Randle, the Knicks are winless since Deblasio commented on Trae Young."
Trae Young is shooting 94% from the line this series and is also going to make the second round.   Just saying.
The world needs Trae Young to score 63 in game 5.
Trae young is averaging 27.7/10.3/3 on .597% TS and +/- of +32
As of right now it’s Either Kawhi or Trae Young
"Hawks might steal a game or two if Trae gets hot, but other than him Sixers completely outmatch the Hawks. They have absolutely now answer for Embiid, and Young/Lou Will will both get destroyed on switches."
"Dude all these young guys are super comfortable and legit. Ja morant, Trae young, Donovan Mitchell. Devin booker is one or two classes earlier but hes finally getting the national stage to shine too"
As a jazz fan - conley  As an nba fan - trae young
Trae young is single handedly beating the Knicks. He is such a difference maker when he's in the game. Almost curry like gravity
Trae young has been excellent
What about Trae young?
"I mean I never said one act by a fan represents the entire fanbase.  But I will tell you this, when the whole Trae Young incident happened, you go on r/nyknicks and you wouldn't find one comment defending that fan or trying to empathize or explain his actions.  I go on r/bostonceltics and from the day that Kyrie made those comments to the incident today and I cant say the same about your sub."
"Ew... you are knicks fan tweeting this with how they trashed Trae Young and spit on him. Yeah doesn't sound right huh, that's what I thought, one act by a fan doesn't represent an entire fanbase."
Rayford Trae young
Trae Young can make free throws. Better than Luka in my book.
Trae Young will play vastly inferior teams than Luka Doncic. FTFY.
Trae Young will win a playoff series before Luka Doncic.
"All the young guys. Ja, Trae, Ayton"
I think Trae Young refused to press charges
"Ayton is the clear frontrunner. And (honestly, no bias, I still complain about the trade on the Hawks subreddit) Trae Young. Very good playoffs for the class of 2018"
How I'm going to rub one out when Reggie Bullock's goes 0-4 like what's the point? I'd be looking at Abella Danger doing her job and I'd remember Trae Young doing the brrrr shivers and it'd ruin everything.
"I'm pretty biased, but I'd say Trae Young (and to a similar extent Ja Morant), just because of how they've been performing in their first ever playoffs.  Derrick Rose too has been balling out."
Incorrect - Trae Young is my favorite player and would absolutely keep him in favor of Luka and it’s not a slight to Luka but watching Trae as a small guard embarrass teams is just so entertaining. Trae has been hated on and told his shyt wouldn’t work in the nba and everyone after his rough start said he was a bust and all he has done is light up the league - night in and night out. We also got reddish who is a pretty good defender and rotation player as well and if he ever finds his shot could be a stud.
Trae Young
"Funny how on some previous r/nba post (either on the Trae Young or Westbrook incident) someone commented on ""which team will be next"" and the most upvoted response was some Celtic fan. You can't even make this up."
No cause Trae Young is a good guy and didn’t press charges
But when someone spits at trae young you call foul? Very consistent.
"Screaming Fuck You at Trae Young.  Throwing Popcorn at Russell Westbrook.  Spitting at Trae Young.  Throwing a water bottle at Kyrie.  No, yeah, anyone not liking it is a person that think it's perfectly acceptable to be disgusting toward players. None of you can explain why it's different than going to McDonalds and doing the same thing to the cashier except for ""they're millionaires"" and ""it's sports!""  This is why I'm trying to deprogram myself from sports in general. I have zero interest in sitting next to any of you at a sports game, let alone root for the same team, or be in the same room as you even outside the sports environment. You don't respect players, you see them as animals even if you don't want to admit it. You show your true colors. It's sad and sorry."
"Knicks fans chanted fuck Trae Young and he shushed the fans, didn't go for the Knicks. This just felt more like Kyrie was disrespecting the Celtics than the fans to me."
Publicly shame whoever does it. Imagine if the Knicks fully zoomed in on the guy who spat on Trae Young
Rayfraud Trae Young Jr.
Same with the Knicks fan and Trae Young.   And the Sixers fan just wanted to give WB some snacks.  Speaking of which wtf was that? The Wizards weren’t even winning. There’s almost 0 chance they make it out this round. Why be a dick at this point?
KD-Harden both have arguments for best scorer in the league  Harden has an argument for best playmaker in the league while KD isn't even top 20.  Neither put up an all defense-level on D. Harden isn't Trae Young-tier for people to act like KD being an above average defender is such a big advantage lol  Replace Harden with an average PG in one scenario and replace KD with an average SF in another and I can easily say the team with Harden-Kyrie have a better chance to win it all than KD-Kyrie
Trae “4000 rpm” Young
"Trae young is like a curry harden combination, his ceiling is absurdly high. If he can play like harden in ball and just mimic half of what Steph does off ball he's gonna be amazing. Way higher ceiling than melo."
Didn't one of your fans literally spit on Trae Young
"Also Kyrie is probably the one player you don’t want to assault. Trae Young didn’t press charges, but Kyrie is the complete opposite of that spectrum."
Ayton and trae young iirc
"Peak Westbrook could kinda score and pass his ass-off albeit not as efficient as the other two. Won the scoring title and nearly won the assist title.  Trae Young, Jokic and Luka look like locks to become the next big scorer-playmakers. It really seems like recently the best scorers and best playmakers have been the same players."
Trae Young is up there
"Don’t worry, Hawks are plenty young, you still have time to lose to Trae too.  Maybe next year."
Didnt your guy spit at Trae Young like 3 days ago?
"Yeah, one team is missing 3 of its starters and going up against 3 of the best scorers ever.  The other is getting their asses handed to them by Trae Young.  Good luck paying Randle the max so he can give you another 12 points on 17 shots next time you make the playoffs.  PS: Y’all are getting embarrassed by a team that doesnt even have homecourt."
"even when we had DSJ, Trae Young was who I wanted with pick #5 cuz I didn’t expect Luka to be available"
We're losing to a literal super team. You're losing to Trae Young.
No way you just replied to my comment about Boston using the Trae Young incident as a way to generalize Knicks fans and then you go ahead and say this...goes to show racists aren’t smart
"Such a dumb comment. One person being a moron doesn't define a fanbase. If it did, Westbrook would be swimming in popcorn and Trae Young in spit"
Luka is obviously better lmao. Trae young is 6 ft tall those guards can’t win as the #1 option. Luka is 6’9 with generational skillset
"Bullock keeps trying to start shit with Trae. And Randle seems to want to want to break something before the end of this series. Considering the hawks are all young, I'm impressed with how calm they're staying all things considered"
I know for a fact that there's an outspoken Hawks flair here that doesn't like Trae Young (maybe not as outspoken at the moment)
"I’m following the playoffs solely to root against KD, Marcus Morris, and Crowder  And to see Trae Young silence crowds"
I felt crazy seeing all the “Trae Young isn’t fun to watch” tweets and comments.  I thought he was fucking fun to watch
Yes because Trae young is playing rn
*Trae Young enters the chat*
Trae Young?
"What? I didn't say that. If we win a ring and Trae Young is averaging 3x as many points as anybody else, then yeah that's his ring, but I never said somebody doesn't deserve a ring because they aren't the first option. I'm just saying Kawhi carried that team, which he did if you compare the Raptors playoff performance pre and post the Kawhi signing"
"I was hoping the 13-2 mash fest the Mets gave the Braves would motivate the Knicks, mostly Julius Randle, a little bit.  But nope.  The Knicks are playing the worst they played all year... Trae Young is a beast and killing us."
"So if trae young goes off and Atl somehow wins a ring this year, does John Collins not deserve it?"
Yep this is 100% whats happening https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/29/knicks-hawks-trae-young-defense here's a good article about how Trae is wriggling out of their attempts to get him switched on a mismatch
"i feel like it’s position based. like if it’s a Trae Young, stat line you would probably have PTS/AST/REB, but it it was someone like Embiid you would have PTS/REB/AST"
Trae young is much better than Julius Randle. Trae showed up in the playoffs but Julius Randle who played poorly in the playoffs.
Trae Young is  better.
"I don't think there's anything wrong with maxing him, but assuming you're going for a championship, I feel like you should be greedier. With Young and the shooters on the team, not to mention Capela as a rim protector, that's pretty much an ideal environment on both ends of the floor, a lot of guys are gonna look good.   I'm not sure what the upcoming FA classes are the next couple of years, but with Trae establishing himself this postseason, if I'm Atlanta, I'm swinging for the fences and trying to get a superstar with that max slot."
I don't want to know a world where this is a flagrant foul. Trae Young will break Chamberlain's records.
"Credit to the hawks they’re out-coaching us to the max. The 2-3 zone they run is exposing the lack of talented scorers we actually have..   also the fact that RJ hasn’t made Trae Young pay for guarding him has been the 2nd real reason we can’t win.. trae is essentially playing only offense its crazy how they won’t even go at him and make him work even a LITTLE  and lastly, Randle just looks so unprofessional.. like an absolute fraud"
Nah you gotta stop drinking the kool aid. Wizards roster is absolutely trash outside of Russ. Beal is a top 10-15 player in the league he may have the worst roster in the playoffs by far. And I am a Trae young fan since the HS days. Trae is coming up on him quick though but he has more firepower to work with. Beal on a good team would be killing in the league.
"ahh yes because that's how offensive impact is measured.  [Trae is more impactful](https://craftednba.com/players/trae-young), than [Bradley Beal](https://craftednba.com/players/bradley-beal). This backed up on basically any site across the internet. The eye tests supports that as well.  Hell the playoffs further highlight this as Trae has been responsible for more than 50% of our points scored.  Also team record fucking matters for these awards as has been shown time and time again.    &amp;#x200B;  I get it you don't watch Hawks games so you don't get it but seriously Beal has absolutely no place in the All-NBA team over Trae."
focus on trae young bro
"Trae young is no where near the worst defender in the NBA, he isn’t even the worst defender on the hawks, Lou Williams is much worse."
The Hawks beat the Heat pretty handedly without Trae Young and DeAndre Hunter playing too.
"They're literally about to win a playoff series comfortably with Trae Young leading them.  The Mavs definitely got the better player in the deal, but it's tough to say the Hawks ""lost"" this trade, considering what they're doing now."
Trae Young and Julius Randle aren't the players we thought they were.
"Antagonizing? Trae Young (he's really the only one who can be called for anything resembling that, the other two are just playing basketball) is only naturally responding to New York crowd, who - let's be fair - sometimes totally deserves it. See Danil Medvedev vs. US Open crowd in I think 2019.  (or in the words of John Lydon: Infamous language?! I speak nothing but the fucking English.)"
Love to watch Trae   He’s a fun villain   As long as he doesn’t backstab the Hawks or start commuting dangerous fouls I’ll root for the young boi
"I'm not saying he's not efficient. He's just not efficient enough to be a top 20 player (Kat, trae young tier).  Here's another way to look at it. Here are jaylen's shooting splits this year according to basketball reference:  0-3 feet: 70.0%  3-10 feet: 44.2%  10-16 feet: 48.4%  16 feet-3pt: 49.0%  3pt: 39.7%  ft: 76.4%  That's some elite stuff. A player with his athleticism, skill, and shooting splits should have a ts% higher than 58.6"
Ehh they play differently and Hunter isn't even the same timezone as John when it comes to efficiency.  John's ability to score so much on so few touches is really helpful on our team.  The problem is consistency from John especially on the defensive end.  I'm super torn as I want to pay him but I waffle on the max.  He's still super young and has gotten better every year and loves it here and has great chemistry with Trae.  Just really torn
Time to trade for Trae Young
"At the moment, it is mostly Knicks fans.  If anybody else has a problem with Trae Young they got their own personal issues lol"
It is not only Knicks fans that dislike Trae Young.
"I was referring to the ""diaper baby poopoo Trae Young"" part. Only Knicks fans hate to see that."
so can Trae Young.
lol trae young waluigi lookin ass
Trae young and Luka two hall of fame talents that will be connected forever wonder if they both will get rings.
Trae Young kind of a goofy looking dude huh
It’s both. Just saying it’s a talent thing doesn’t alleviate the fact that Trae young  and Williams get to rest on defense sitting on bullock in the corner. Even if the Knicks had a bit more talent you can’t win playoff series without taking advantage of weaknesses on the opposing teams defense.
\*Trae Young foul baiting\*  r/nba: That's not basketball.  \*Booker and CP3 doing it against the Lakers\*  r/nba: Outstanding move.
"Zero points while guarded primarily by Trae ""Worst Defensive Player in NBA History"" Young"
Trae Young happened. The non all star - non all nba Trae “lollipop mop” Young is putting some respect on his name.
Trae Young is what this city has needed. There’s a reason guys like Wilkins and Primetime are legends in this city.   LFG.
I'm surprised people hate Trae Young so much when it seems like Booker gets waaaaay more ticky tack foul calls
"Bud, no one has an issue celebrating a win. Bud acting like you won the finals,, chanting ""F*** Trae Young"" and having someone actually spit on him doesn't make us insecure. NY fans taste success and they're insanely different"
"I'll be real, Randle didn't play well, but he is still receiving far too much criticism. It was his first playoffs being ""the guy,"" and he wasn't used to such ferocious intensity and targeting by Nate McMillan. Both of these teams had unreal defense but Atlanta was by far the more aggressive and favored offensive threat. This team had no expectations coming into the season and you can't say this isn't anything but a crazy success.  The same way people are talking about Randle rn is how people talked about dirk for like ten years before he won with the Mavs. Very young team.   Exciting time for the league rn and this series was sick even though its a little one sided. Trae young straight balled out and told everyone that he is here, no denying him anymore, even compared to Luka hes legit. Derrick rose proved he still got that shit, even after a long list of injuries this dude is still a baller, greatest what if in NBA history. Knicks young players are unreal, RJ, Quickley and Toppin had no business playing like they did the first couple games. I feel like if all of the players develop accordingly the Knicks could win the title eventually. Thats the first time I've said that in like 10 years."
"All of us on the east coast were Hawks fans for this round just because we hate the Sixers, but watching your team they really have heart and Trae Young has emerged as one of my favorite players"
Trae Young is an all time great
did trae young fuck your mom or something?
"Trae young has been fucking insane in his FIRST playoff run, a lot of people have to take the L, I didn't think he would be this good tbh"
fuck trae young
"They should try trading him for Trae Young, that guys pretty good"
"Trae Young is a normal NBA player that's going bald, nothing he does is villain worthy, everyone baits for free throws and have been since the league was created  People desperately want this drama shit, villain lmao, why? Because he talked back to Knicks fans?"
I maybe sorta implied that Derrick White was perhaps a better basketball player than Trae Young...
I was praying for another bow and wave from Trae Young to the fans tonight.
Trae Young.
Really? I dont watch college too much but I felt like Ja morant and Trae young were two players that I just knew were special. They were heads and shoulders above everyone else on the floor whenever they played.
I’m starting to think those guys are overrated and trae young is underrated !!!
Trae Young is special. He could be a generational talent in the post Lebron era.
Does trae young get to keep the ball?
"That was a beautifully orchestrated comeback complete with Louis Williams microwave, Onyeka Clutch Buckets and Embiid D, Clint redemption after an embarrassing first 3, perfectly executed hack-a-ben, and Trae “FMVP” Young magic. Shout out the defensive clamps in Q4!!!"
Trae Young is bringing out the tears on the road and as a neutral fan I love it.
mfs tryna tell me hes better than Trae Young
"Bro why are u telling me this, I am not the one voting. I am pro Trae Young."
"His main competition are Steph and Dame, honestly I would rather take Trae Young over them"
There was plenty of pressure in the close out game against the Knicks and trae Young balled out. Im much more confident that trae young will show up than I am that Ben Simmons will
"Yea this makes me feel way better about losing to the Hawks, respect Trae Young 🙏🙏"
"Trae young been an absolute monster so this shouldnt be a knock lol. Hes got so many offensive tools and is a great playmaker, mans averaging like 30 points and 10 dimes a night this playoffs"
Nah. You got Trae Young. This guy is an alien.
Holy fuck I'm shitting myself. Trae Young can fuck my bitch. I don't care anymore. Hawks in 6. What the actual fuck.
Ya know what. Since I’m came in calm on my last take maybe I’ll come in a little hot. I think Trae Young and Luka Doncic are a LOT closer than people think.
"People forget that Trae Young was a meme on here before the playoffs(unjustifiably in many ways)   It was like with Booker, the ""empty stats"" people were all over the place until he proved himself in the playoffs"
And Trae Young keeps going and Doc Rivers still can’t win in the playoffs
"No way they won.   Unreal.   Had to step out for a bit and had a crazy thought they could do it, but no way.   Trae Young proves me wrong weekly."
"This series somehow has made me like trae young, which I thought was not possible"
I love trae young
The Sixers couldn't score on a lineup featuring Trae Young and Lou Williams together. I simply cannot understand it.
You should teach trae young how to play basketball
"Bros, at the moment I’m in deep hot take contemplation. Is Trae young that dope or Embiid and Simmon that much of bitches? This plagues my mind"
Coming into tonight Trae young averaged 28.3 ppg in the playoffs...
Is this a Trae Young burner I'm gonna be sick
"Trae Young, fucking mamba mentality"
Everyone just babbling on here 😂😂😂 trae young the real deal
Galaxy brain plays by Trae Young &amp; Co. to let Philly go up to invert the curse
"That sort of makes OP’s point though. “He can’t play defense!!” is thrown around constantly when people talk about Trae Young, but if what it takes to expose that fully is a Irving-Harden backcourt - if neither of the playoff teams the Hawks have faced so far has the personnel to really leverage that issue - then maybe it’s not the huge deal it’s made out to be."
Just a year ago sixer’s fans were in my dm’s for even mentioning a trade for trae young.  What a difference a year makes.
Is this where we pretend trae young and lou Williams have looked like good defenders their entire careers?
Would you rather have Trae Young or Ben Simmons?
How do you go on that long of a scoring drought against a backcourt of Trae Young and Lou Williams??
Not even trae young they got torched by Lou fucking Williams in the 4th.. at home.. in a game 5
Trae Young is my hero
"dude I'm legitimately sorry, I'm honest to god rooting for you guys cuz fuck trae young"
Remember Bradley Beal got All NBA over Trae Young.  Lol.
"Yes Lou Williams went vintage mode. Yes, Trae Young is a fucking beast (though Holy shit the dude takes 4 steps at least once ever single lay up attempt he's not alone in this but it's still infuriating to watch him blow by simply because he's traveling egregiously), but WHATHE GODDAMN FUCK WAS THA 4TH QUARTER OFFENSE.  No scheme execution at all. So many forced bad shots. So many careless turnovers   How the fuck did a team this big let the hawks get so many offensive rebounds  And fucking hack a Ben, my God you get paid 10s of millions of dollars a year to play goddamn basketball, and you can't make free throws more than half the time. Free-throw are all about the time you spend practicing the shot. You get in what you put out. Guys like Nash would take over a hundred free throws a day. It's all routine. If your not making them, it's inexcusable.  The Hawjs didn't win, the 76ers didn't want to win. I'm sorry but it's the fucking truth.  PATHETIC"
“Fuck that cat” - Trae Young
Trae young took 19 free throws. Such a great product.
When you think you can clamp KD but you get destroyed by Trae Young instead
"I want to give credit to the hawks. I really want to. I hate Trae young and everything about his game, but I want to give Atlanta credit.   But I just can’t. They’re not doing anything special to win these games. They didn’t adjust their defense in the 4th. Philly is just gagging in a way that defies logic. Someone new fucks up every game. Game 1 was Doc. Game 4 was Embiid and Simmons. Game 5 was Simmons and Harris. I just can’t fathom how it’s possible.   The Bucks I can at least understand. Terrible coach plus going against Durant on the road. But this is inexplicable."
Trae Young is a bad man
At this rate Trae Young is gonna comeback against male pattern baldness 🙌
At least we lost to kevin durant not trae young lmaooo
"Trae Young is an annoying little pest, but it’s hard not to root for the guy."
REMEMBER WHEN DALLAS DRAFTED TRAE YOUNG?
You guys are losing to Trae young a third year tiny PG who supposedly would be unplayable in the playoffs because of his defense
"Trae "".3%"" Young"
"Damn, due to attrition, Trae Young is really going to win a Finals MVP before Luka Doncic and Marvin Bagley."
"dont be too sad Philly fans, y'all got dicked by lord Trae Young himself."
Can't even clamp Trae Young
"Filthadelphia gets to be the laughingstock of the NBA  for a few days. Good! Cry Philly Cry, is what the city does best.  Trae Young just moved into my top 5 favorite players in the NBA right now."
I would like to say hi to all the Trae Young doubters since day one.
Trae Young about to fuck around and get finals MVP
yeah man much rather get solo'ed by KD than Trae Young lol
THEY SAID TRAE YOUNG WAS A BAD CHOICE
Trae Young is unreal.
Except Trae “dropped 39 in your home stadium” Young is on our team
Trae Young &gt; Luka Doncic
Ice Trae “21 strains hair” young
Trae “worst defender in the league” Young leading his team a game away from ECF first year in playoffs….huh.
"The difference between Simmons(4/14) and Trae Young(17/19) is a killer for the Sixers  Say what you will about ""foul baiting"" but Trae's free throw accuracy is unironically a huge asset for him and the Hawks"
They do. Trae Young baby
Trae Young is the most fearless player to play in the NBA since Iverson.
Trae young is that fucking guy man. We have been TRYING to tell yall for years
I’m losing my mind. I don’t have Cable so I’m here watching a Trae Young interview instead of the game. Get it together TNT
I must admit I completely hate Trae young.  I'm sure he's an alright guy as a person but as a player he represents everything that's wrong with basketball IMO
i started the playoffs hating trae young but holy shit do i love this guy now
Trae young said he ain’t going back to Philly
oh my god  trae fucking young
"If 10 years ago you sat me down and told me that Trae Young would lead the Atlanta Hawks to the NBA finals, i would have been like ""... who's Trae Young?"""
Trae Young is not an all star
"Joel Embiid: ""Trae Young is the best player in the world"""
Sixers deserved this L after that 4Q collapse but Trae Young had 20 FTs hahahaha wtf
"As a Nets fan, I really hope Hawks knock out the 76ers. But Trae Young is scary."
Trae young owns embiid
"TRAE ""NOT BEN SIMMONS"" YOUNG"
Trae Young going to the WCF
Absolutely unbelievable.   Trae young really that mf
Trae Young took the best heel turn ive ever seen for an NBA player
Trae Young is the mayor of 3 cities. Incredible
Are we going to get Ayton and Trae Young in the conference finals before Luka??
TRAE YOUNG IS THAT GUY
Trae Young is the most hated man in Philly and NY
Trae Young is a superstar.
TRAE YOUNG &gt; MICHAEL JORDAN
Trae Young is the Pat Mahommes of the NBA
"Trae Young - We're not the fucking bucks, can't let this opportunity go"
Tell Izzy that Trae Young sends his regards
"For this year, it's the market. For the last 5 years of the 2010s, it was a homegrown team that attracted another superstar because they were already insanely good that kept OKC and the next generation Spurs from ever reaching the finals again. Over at the East, it was straight seasons of LeBron: big market, small market, superstar teammates, absolutely trash teammates- it didn't matter. The point is you never know when another dynasty/all time great emerges out of the blue. Orlando probably thought they were about to take control of the East after making the finals in 1995 with such a young and promising duo, only took one off season from the Bulls to lose any hope of going back.  Case in point, what if Trae Young takes another step and the Hawks fix their very few weak points next season? What if Lillard/Beal gets traded for Simmons making Sixers instant contenders?"
"Or it’s statistics and not every team is gonna lose their best or second best player long term. The Suns have two elite players and a budding guy in Ayton, the Hawks literally run through Trae Young from what I’ve seen of them."
"I wonder if Nate McMillan has the balls to do this haha. Everyone thinks the ball will be going to Trae Young (assuming he isn't injured). I wouldn't fault him for making Capela take a wide open 3 on a pick and pop. If he's wide open, why not? I remember Tim Duncan hit a big 3 against the Suns before because he was wide open on a pick and pop"
"You are a Hawks fan who dealt with  Trae Young get his ass slandered since his rookie year because he ""cant take a team to the playoffs"" and now you turn around and look at KAT the same way, KAT is a more talented player than Trae despite that.   &amp;#x200B;  No NBA players besides the most elite guys top 3 in the NBA can carry a team truly, you need great pieces and the Hawks got Capela, Bogi, Gallo, Lou, etc. and finally make the playoffs.   &amp;#x200B;  Did you think Trae wasnt able to lead a team to the playoffs last season? Did you also think Trae shouldve been traded because he ""Cant lead a team"" your argument makes no sense. Have a good day."
Trae Young is not better than Devin Booker jesus fucking christ
&amp;#x200B;  even drafting Ayton was a mistake in the sense that he could of had Luka or Trae Young instead.
TRAE YOUNG KNOWS HE CAN'T BEAT ME!  SO HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA TRY!
"You can fit this narrative to any team. Would you want   a) CP3 ""dirtiest floppiest player""  b) Pat Bev (dirtiest gangster wannabe) and Cousins (emotional lesbian)  c) Trae Young (floppy player as well who always tries to win free throws)  d) Bucks (insert dirty flaws here)  to win a chip?  So point stands. You can never choose a correct team to win in everyone's POV."
When Trae Young is on the court their defense is unplayable.  Notice how in the last full Giannis game Lopez didn’t close out the game.  I think Bud realized they’re more effective when they’re on the floor at different times.

[The Athletic's algorithm](https://theathletic.com/news/trae-young-injury-hawks-star-misses-game-4-vs-bucks-with-bone-bruise-in-foot/4qj4KrUSuSFO) estimated ""four-plus week Optimal Recovery Time for the foot to fully heal"", although they did say it is possible to play through the pain/inflammation. Still, I think the most likely scenario is that neither Giannis or Trae return this playoffs.  &gt;Did you watch the last game?  Eh, that was one game and it looked much more like the Bucks' collapsing mentally after Giannis' injury. The Hawks' offense has looked lost throughout this playoffs without Trae on the floor. I can see the Hawks taking a game, maybe even two, if their offensive pieces are running hot, but realistically not three games in a row. From what I've seen, this Bucks' team just has a higher floor than the Hawks' team."
Brook was getting played off the court by Trae Young.   His being able to play this many minutes was as much about Trae being out as Giannis being out.
"Ok... but also they were playing the Hawks without Trae Young. Which is a much worse team than the healthy Suns.   Not to mention, Brook just had a *career* best playoff game with 33 points at *33 years old* on 14/18 shooting. I love Brook but I wouldn’t bank on that."
"What are you talking about? This was absolutely without a doubt, one of the basketball games we've seen this playoffs.  Jokes aside, Trae Young is much more integral to Hawks' offense than Giannis is to the Bucks' and it showed. Not sure how the Hawks can bring this back. Even when Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis Jr aren't popping off, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are much more consistent scorings options than anyone on this Hawks team. I just don't see a good answer from the Hawks to the Bucks dominance in the paint either."
Nah he’s more of a product of Trae Young. When Trae isn’t playing his production goes from close to an all star to just another guy who jumps high and can hit an occasional three. If another team pays more than that for him to have a bigger role they’ll be disappointed.
What happened to Trae Young? How come he isn’t playing?
Why is Trae Young dressed like Rocky when he's training?
I miss Trae Young.
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ *gib us trae young*
Trae Young needs to toughen up and play next game. Who knows if the Hawks will ever get this chance again?
So does trae young play game 6?
The lack of ‘Fuck Trae Young’ chants this series is what’s hurting us
"If I’m Atlanta, I’m going to be one of the teams going hard after Kawhi this summer. Yeah he’s probably going to stay with the clippers, but a Trae Young Kawhi Leonard pick and roll flanked by Bogonavic, Collins, and Capela would be nicee"
Brook Lopez goes from unplayable with Trae Young on the floor to Shaq without him lmao
Except for Trae Young.
Why are you guys so down on the hawks? Trae young makes their offense go. You can argue that losing him is bigger than the bucks losing Giannis. Give them a break
The whole hawks team got the Trae young whistle early. Wonder if the refs will come out hot again in the 2nd half
Trae young game 1 vs bucks  48/11/(maybe 3 boards) on 50%
Think Hawks fans had the same thought about Trae Young in the last game
Trae Young is very inefficient from behind the arc. He doesn’t scare me like say a Stephen Curry.
Not with Trae Young.
Im no chuck barkley but it seems like trae young is the real fucking deal and has been carrying an entire team
Hawks need Trae Young way more than Bucks need Giannis
Question is Trae young on the Hawks sidecourt?
Trae Young rocking the TY beanie baby hoodie. Nice!
Worst finals in Nba history.  Grandpa Chris Paul and his adopted edgy stepson Booker against the gollum Trae Young
Let’s not act like Trae Young is a sure fire HOFer based on one playoff run. The rule changes next year are gonna mess him up.
trae young in terms of the game managing style and trying to abuse the rules (not in a bad way)
"Other than Paul, I would say Durant and Harden are the first two that come to mind (even though Harden abandoned the midrange in Houston). Might include Middleton when he is playing well (which comes and goes). Jokic can score from just about anywhere and has great passing skills to boot.  Booker, Trae, and Luka are all young but showing the complete package. Maybe Mitchell.  Lebron used to have more of a midrange package, but he seems more inside-outside now."
"The Clippers were fucked by injuries, that's the point. It should've been another year of Kawhi competing for a title but then he got hurt. I don't give a fuck what franchise he's playing for, it doesn't change the fact that he's Kawhi Leonard. His injury is also what made it a wide open title.  And yes, the Hawks have suffered from injuries with one of their best players being out for the entire postseason and now not having Trae Young for two games. Again, that's bad. Not good. Worsens the product."
Why do so many people not watch the WNBA?  Because the product isn't as good.  What makes the product good?  Good players.  Superstars like Trae Young and Giannis Antetokounmpo not playing *worsens the product*.
"Because the games have been amazing and its a different perspective watching the underdog teams come out rather than the same guys every year   Its nice watching the young stars dominating. Ja, Mitchell, Jokic, Luka, Trae, Giannis, Booker, Ayton"
You think Trae Young and Giannis Antetokounmpo wouldn't be desperate to win? They add to the product
There’s honestly few things in the NBA that are more just pure entertainment than a guy who knows he’s the villain and just leans into it. Trae Young during the Knicks series was just so much fun to watch when he purposely riled up the crowd.
People never call Giannis by his last name people do call Trae Young by his
They were ahead of the pacer as the Pacers could not even make it to the playoffs. The Pacers also do not have anyone as good as Trae Young on their roster.
"https://theathletic.com/2421465/2021/03/02/behind-the-scenes-failed-lloyd-pierce-era-why-atlanta-hawks-eager-for-new-voice/   here you go you need more?   &gt;But the real headliner event took place when Pierce and Trae Young met privately to discuss their upcoming third year together. At that point, anyone and everyone around the Hawks organization was well aware the relationship between these two key figures was strained.    &gt; But in the end — after old tensions between Pierce and Young resurfaced, other players grew frustrated with Pierce’s style    &gt; And the primary reason for it all, sources say, is that several players — from Young on down — were eager to hear a new voice.    &gt; But Young was hardly alone here. Sources say player support beyond Young was dwindling at the end, with several sharing their desire for a change with management recently. Still, the difficult dynamic between Young and Pierce was an undeniable factor in Pierce’s downfall and a tone-setter of sorts for the group at large.    &gt; Pierce took the tough love approach with Young from Day 1, opting to push him hard as a way of maximizing his celebrated talent.   &gt; Pierce made a public comment two seasons ago about not running plays for Collins, and it rubbed the Hawks big man the wrong way. Collins went to Pierce about his issue with the statement, but Pierce, sources say, turned around and called Collins’ approach selfish in wanting to have a more defined role on the team. Over time, the residue from these types of situations remained.    im tryna post stuff relevant but the whole thing is so read it lol"
"Not Chris Paul after all those miserable years on the Clippers? Not Harden/Basketball-Hitler-in-training Trae Young?   I'll agree there's no one I dislike on the Bucks, but they're probably done.  It could be enlightenment. Could be you need to work on your hate game. You choose."
"""Do you think Trae Young would still be an amazing player regardless where he was drafted?""  You think Trae is putting up these numbers in year three is he's aback-up point guard his first season? The idea that Atlanta wasn't great for Trae is crazy."
"I was with you until you're saying CP3 isn't as good as Trae Young or Damian Lillard. Then, I was like ""oh he just probably means in the playoffs"" but you included Curry, who didn't make the playoffs. This comment is a real mixed bag.  What are you trying to say here?"
"Beginning of the year I thought this was going to be the best playoffs in awhile. Lebron vs time, bron vs CP, luka vs kawhi, the plight of playoff p. Clippers vs nuggets. Murray vs Mitchell.  We get to find out how the suns young players act in the playoffs. Trae young, ben simmons, Tobias Harris vs embiid and curry. Can doc exorcise his playoff demons? I feel like there are still so many questions on the table that we won’t get answered this year. Injuries suck. Hope the nba learned their lesson, the ratings are about to be shit"
Trae Young 🥶
The mighty Trae Young? Ofc
"I disagree as I think if Trae Young can play in game 7 and Giannis can not play in game 7, the hawks could win game 7. Trae is better than Middleton and Holiday so he could be the difference in the series."
"&gt;I fully believe we wouldn't have utilized Trae correctly and he would not have become this Trae Young with the Grizzlies.  Trae put up 29.6/4.3/9.3 on 59.5% TS in his 2nd year while being coached by one of the worst coaches to grace the NBA recently and playing on arguably the worst roster in the entire NBA, especially accounting for John Collins' 25 game suspension.   Even his rookie year he put up 19/8 on 54% TS.   A lot of their pieces have come together this year, but Atlanta was an awful situation for Trae's first 2 years. The guy was bust-proof. His ""struggles"" consisted of Summer League and like the first 20 games of his rookie season."
"But that’s not my point, my point is that you don’t need to rush to put ranks on players like Luka who are young as fuck and have a lot of their biggest games ahead of them.  Like, we’ve gotten to see that trae is special this post season snd he took the opportunity and has blown up and we’ve got to see him in the long playoff grind. Luka definitely showed he was a special talent don’t get me wrong, but Luka hasn’t had the same kind of opportunity trae had this year."
"I find it hilarious you think CP3 is a bitch for flopping when you're bandwagoning a team with Trae Young.  Flopping in a close game to get free points and rest ain't being a bitch, it's playing smart."
"Sorry Hawks, Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter, John Collins, other young players I can't remember; they've all peaked. The only way is down from here."
"Yes but it's a valid criticism to how lucky the Suns have been this playoff run.   Lakers - no AD  Nuggets - no Jamal  Clippers - no Kawhi  Bucks - no Giannis  Hawks - no Trae Young (maybe)  These are all the best players on each of their respective teams. It's great that the Suns took advantage of it, but saying it's not a valid complaint is idiotic."
"I fully believe we wouldn't have utilized Trae correctly and he would not have become this Trae Young with the Grizzlies. Credit Atlanta with putting the pieces around Trae to maximize him and letting him play through his struggles.  Also, we are in Year 3 of their careers. Jaren was drafted on potential, on his long term value, of what he was going to become. And he is still absolutely on that trajectory. So the ""take the best player available"" isn't really a thing, at least not yet. We don't know who is better."
lol no. This sub woulda creamed just as hard or even harder if the Suns knocked off a heathy Lebron and Kawhi Clippers. The complaint is that they didn’t have to. Nobody gives a shit if the Suns make the finals its how it happened.  If Trae didn’t already have a bad unfair reputation and was as popular at young Curry the Hawks upsets would of been unanimously rooted for. Nobody cares about new players being here just cause. People want competitive series.
I don’t understand all this revisionist history. I remember Ayton being pretty much a lock for the number 1 pick. After that it was kinda a toss up on the next pick. Yea we can sit here and shit on teams for not drafting Trae young  or Luka but it’s not like he was considered the best available above Jackson at that time. With this type of thinking we might as well shit on every team that didn’t draft Jokic even though he was a late 2nd round pick.
"Lmao you’re describing my exact feelings toward Booker as well. I have no reason to dislike him but I just do for some reason. And I don’t think it’s the cocky factor either. I have no problems with Trae Young, for instance, and Kobe was my favorite player."
"Trae young was a major reach tbh, I’m not even gonna act like I wanted the hawks to take him cuz I didn’t lol, hindsight is crazy tho, glad we got him now"
Because Trae Young got an unbelievable amount of negative media and scout attention prior to the draft. Famously there was an anonymous quote from a scout that said they wouldn’t take Trae under any circumstances. He was thought to be way too undersized to succeed in the NBA
Imagine Trae Young getting a title before Cp3.....Big yikes.  Cant imagine how cp3 would handle that
"I hated Trae Young at first, but oddly he won me over by doubling down on the villain shenanigans.  Taking a bow at MSG was over the top, and I love it"
"I find it a little easier to root for them when their faces admit it  - when Trae Young stopped short on Dwight and then looked at the camera and did push ups, I jumped on the bandwagon.  Fuck yeah, OWN IT.  When Chris was on the floor after getting some ludicrous call in this game there was a moment he smiled up knowingly at his team - It softened my hatred of his tactics a bit at least.     I still have mixed feelings about Lebron and his constant butthurt face but at least he got some karma when he flailed his own self into a cameraman several years ago and still sports a fucking circle on his head as a result"
"I never said he was not though. I am saying, the AMOUNT of attention and notoriety he gets is potentially unwarranted. Everybody says Russ isn’t as good as he is because he can’t win, Trae Young earned his respect in the PLAYOFFS, Tatum showed up in ECF games, Giannis and the Bucks are getting scorched by the same media that voted him 2x MVP and DPOY because they aren’t winning. Doncic has not won, and soon the sharks will turn to feed."

Doncic has not won, and soon the sharks will turn to feed."
"I was in the same boat as OP, and I gotta admit a lot of it was hate because he kept getting all these amazing stats and the Suns were still a lottery team. Was fully on the ""he can't be the best player on a championship team"" boat.   I'm in the process of doing a full 180 on the guy (and Trae Young, for similar reasons). He's fucking good, and I'm really happy for you all that Ayton and him will be around for a while (it seems, at least)."
I haven't even told you how I feel about Trae Young possibly making the finals in his third year! Did you know that he's getting there before Luka?
"  Player | FG% | 3PT% | FT% ---|---|----|---- Damian Lilliard | 46 | 45| 94 Jayson Tatum | 42 | 39 | 92 Trae Young | 43 | 33 | 87 Paul George (FULL) | 44 | 34 | 84 Paul George (v Suns) | 42 | 29 | 77  Cmon man just be objective for a second. It's obvious that PG played terrible, especially in the Suns series. That Sun's series is actually the most accurate comparison between all of these players because Tatum and Dame are both the first option on their team, and PG was the first option for the Clipps in their series against the Suns. There's not way you can spin PG's playoff run in a positive light.  Also, LMFAO @ comparing PG to Trae. Trae is in his 3rd year in the league, this was his first playoff run, and he is a known chucker and low-efficiency player. And even with all those caveats, Trae still played better this post season than George did vs the Suns (again, Trae is the 1st option so you have to compare to when PG was 1st option too)."
"We all agree this is Lloyd Pierce’s doing, right? Trae not making the actual team along with none of the Hawks young guys (Collins, Huerter, Reddish, etc) not even making the select team?"
"Using field goal percentage to say that they were bringing their team down is so stupid. PG shot 42.8% which isn’t even that bad. Trae young in the victory over the 76ers shot 39.6% from the field. Dame in his loss against Denver shot 42.5% from the field. Tatum in his loss against nets shot 39.6% from the field. These are all worse than Paul George’s fg%. Does that mean these guys are the reason their team lost? Or in trae’s case, the reason why it got pushed to 7 games when it should’ve been less? No. Value isn’t measured through field goal percentage. Anyone who isn’t a hater can see how valuable Paul George was. The clippers didn’t lose bc of Paul George. The blazers didn’t lose bc of dame. The Celtics didn’t lose bc of Tatum. Despite what fg% may say"
"I think Trae Young could maybe be back for the finals, so Hawks"
"My point was more that just because Harden always had the ability to play good defense, that doesn't retroactively make him a good defender in those years when he didn't try. He was still a bad defender in those days, or at least a lazy one, and the criticism was justified.  Trae Young and Harden have both locked up Giannis in these playoffs though so who knows maybe they're both gonna be all defense next year."
"Honestly, suspend somebody a game for doing shit like that. If it's a choice between him and trae young, the choice is easy."
"It is coincidence for most of them. Giannis, Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, and Trae Young had freak injuries. AD and Kawhi are always getting hurt. LeBron regular season injury and Harden are the only ones that might have to do with the condensed season, but a 36 year old breaking down after playing so much isn't rare or unique and Harden was famously in bad shape to start the year."
"I can see it already  ""Is young the best 22 year old PG the league has ever seen?"" ""Did atlanta win the trade?"" ""Is trae better than luka?"" ""Does trae have the highest skill vs worst hair ratio in nba history?"" ""Is trae better than AI?"" ""Has trae already surpassed nash?"" ""If trae was Lukas height would he be better than MJ?""  Sorting by new is something else"
"&gt; With a ring and FMVP Paul is arguably top 20 of all time.  i don't think a ring and an fmvp should significantly move the needle on your all-time evaluation of CP3, relative to the career he's put together up to this point. maybe if it was some kind of insane jordanesque finals performance, but not if he wins it against the 20/21 hawks minus trae young"
&gt;a shortened season didn’t make Trae Young step on a referee’s ankle. It didn’t make Kyrie step on Giannis’. It didn’t make Giannis land awkwardly and bend his knee backwards. It didn’t make Solomon Hill dive into LeBron’s leg. It didn’t make CP3 get his shoulder pulled. It didn’t make AD and Kawhi injury probe players  Do you realize that overwork/overuse can put athletes at greater risk for injury? Just because there was an injury that seemed to be caused by contact with someone else (like Trae's) it doesn't mean that was the only factor.   Also lol at the amount of people saying the short offseason/condensed schedule had nothing to do with Giannis' knee injury. He literally had been dealing with a calf injury on the same leg.
"Tbh I think there is difference between a player who doesn't play defense and one who can't.  Harden was an unmotivated defender, Trae Young is a bad defender."
They’re not gonna be good games if Trae Young / Giannis are out with injuries. Were any of the suns nuggets games “good games?”
I agree somewhat. But a shortened season didn’t make Trae Young step on a referee’s ankle. It didn’t make Kyrie step on Giannis’. It didn’t make Giannis land awkwardly and bend his knee backwards. It didn’t make Solomon Hill dive into LeBron’s leg. It didn’t make CP3 get his shoulder pulled. It didn’t make AD and Kawhi injury probe players (though it probably didn’t help).   There was a lot of bad luck that caused this situation and it just comes down partly to being the side effect of a contact sport
"Yeah man, Trae Young stepping on a refs foot is cause of a condescended schedule. I’m sure James Harden showing up to the season out of shape didn’t attribute to his soft tissue injuries."
Hell yeah I’m underestimating them because Trae young is injured
Not if they play the Hawks and Trae Young is available.
Trae young
Adam silver really rushed the season for money just to get Suns vs Hawks in the finals without Trae Young. It’s gonna get worse ratings than the 2003 finals
"You can only play the team that's in front of you. Nearly every year, there's a major injury that happens in all of Pro Sports. Injuries are a part of the game unfortunately, and how teams deal with those injuries can be the difference between winning and losing. When Carson Wentz went down during the Eagles Super Bowl run, everyone immediately wrote them off. However, Nick Foles stepped up, and played out of his mind in one of the best Playoff runs a QB could have. Sure, the Suns may have benefitted off of those injuries, but it doesn't take away from the fact that they still have to get up, perform, and win. If the Suns didn't take advantage of their opportunity, we would be bashing them for losing, as we're doing to Milwaukee losing to a Trae Young-less Hawks.   It does suck that many key players have been injured this season, but it doesn't take away from the fact that players still have to go out, perform and execute."
"Trae Young, John Collins, Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish and 7 firsts"
"This made me want to look up the leaders in possessions doubled/game:  Top 5 for the regular season:  1: Trae Young - 26.9; 43.9% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss   2: Luka Doncic - 26.9; 45.1% of possessions; 1.21 team pts/poss  3: Damian Lillard - 23.8; 40.3% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss  4: Chris Paul - 22.9; 42.8% of possessions; 1.19 team pts/poss  5: Bradley Beal - 22.4; 47.1% of possessions; 1.13 team pts/poss  -------------  Side note: It's hilarious how many of these stats I look up and see Trae and Luka 1 and 2 in some order. I know Luka's better and everything, but it's still absurd to have 2 players that aren't only this good but are this good at so many of the same things and defended in similar ways that were drafted the same year and traded for each other."
Wiseman is 20 a super young 20 his bday was in march.  Simmons clogs spacing massively is on a max is afraid to even drive against Trae Young and can't shoot.
If it’s the Hawks with an injured trae young maybe
This sounds exactly like a comment someone would have made about Trae Young last year tbh.
It's kinda true though at least for non bigs. Who gets the glory Kris Dunn or Trae Young?
Thanks for posting... How the hell is Trae Young and Ja Morant not on this team???!!!
"Dude I've seen ""serious"" basketball pages claim that defense is just 100% effort lmao. He posted the one clip of giannis settling for a fadeaway on trae young as his example too"
"they love the ""empty stats guy"" concept but Devin Booker and Trae Young were ""those guys"" and they had great playoff runs now that their teams are a bit better.  Maybe empty stats guys are few and far between in reality."
"Nate does an excellent job at hiding Trae Young, Jokic actually improving on defensive end as well. But yeah playing hard defense all the time is very tiring especially if you carry big offensive load"
All I remember is Trae Young getting hurt and Trae stepped on him
"Yeah, but tbf it was Trae Young that stepped on his foot"
what's the story behind this? is sean wright the one that injured trae young?
And Neymar diving is just like Trae Young drawing fouls.
"Echo chamber: ""Trae Young is the worst defender in the league. Look at his stats last year.""  Me: Ok but the stats this year say there's about 3-4 dozen players worse than him in the regular season, and he had the 30th best defensive rating in the playoffs out of 239 qualified players.  Echo chamber: ""Stats don't tell the whole story. Use the eye test.""  Meanwhile, they've never watched a Hawks game and only watch highlights on YouTube and Twitter."
Yikes!  Imagine browsing old post and reminiscing on beating the Sixers.  Kind of sad bro. You should be thinking about why the Olympic team didn't call Trae Young. up.
"Trae has the 11th best selling jersey in the NBA at age 22 and was just bum rushed by 30+ kids in the Bahamas chanting “Trae Young!” in his first vacation after the playoff run.   Trae is really, really popular with the younger generation.  He was Gigi Bryant’s favorite player.  Do not underestimate what this will do to his status as his fan base ages and he accomplishes more in the NBA."
"Who’s more valuable, Lloyd Pierce or Trae Young? Easy choice for me"
Why won’t they invite Trae Young?
Trae Young gets doubled at half court and picked up full court
"It’s sad how much we hate on young players too. Most of the answers in this thread are 2nd or 3rd yr guys. Trae is only 22 ffs, expectations for these guys are sky high early"
Neither was Trae Young.  That was more egregious
"Trae Young is the epitome of this thread.  People look only at boxscores of bad teams.  They see someone having good stats and automatically assume, he can't be good because he doesn't elevate his team LeBron style. Then they repeat shit they read online like ""bad defender"" etc and it starts a narrative."
"Before this season, I think a lot of people would have said Trae Young.  But damn, he sure changed his reputation this year."
"Unfortunately I’m not Trae Young and neither is your corny ass. It might be a big deal to him, but I don’t think he’s bitching about it like you are. Some of y’all get worked up over the most minuscule shit."
"If you don't win gold and leave Trae Young, Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox off, its going to be a bloodbath for Pop."
&gt;Team success matters a lot when it comes to ranking players  There's our point of disagreement I guess  I look at the Mavericks roster and Clippers roster and am shocked that series even went 6 let alone 7  It's like comparing the Grizzlies roster to the Jazz and no one clowned on the Grizzlies or Ja for losing to them  Just as I didn't believe Booker and Trae Young were trash until this year I don't think Luka is bad because he can't beat two hall of famers in their prime with Dorian Finney Smith as his 2nd best player  I can't even believe it was as close as it was
"The Hawks’ run this year was incredible and fun to watch, but I don’t think it’s apples to apples with the WCF blazers considering how young the Hawks core are. Trae Young is a budding superstar with time to build around; Dame and the blazers were in a win-now spot and failed to build a team that could win now"
"True, but is not likely to ever reach Steph’s popularity as a face of the league. Only a few players ever have been a face of the league  People just wanna liken these players to eachother but they’re not really in similar situations, and the casual fan barely knows who Trae Young is or cares compared to Steph"
"Lamelo. I think he’ll be good but my god is he overrated. Ppl were saying that Lamelo rn is better than Fox, SGA, and Westbrook or saying that he’s a top 10 point guard rn. Another thing I’ve been seeing was Lamelo will be better than trae young, which is absolutely stupid. Trae had a 30 and 9 season in his sophomore. I don’t see Lamelo even reaching 30 ppg at any point in his career. I’ve also seen ppl say Lamelo is the best rookie since KD or the best rookie of the past 10 years. He ain’t even the best rookie in the past 2 years, it’s luka and I’d honestly argue that ja was a better rookie too."
"This team needs Trae Young and Jarrett Allen, wtf is this."
"I think the key here is ""Young Steph"". I think you could make an argument Trae is approaching that level of popularity Steph had at the same age. This playoff run was huge for him, especially given the audacious nature of Game 1 against the Bucks and the whole Knicks series."
International rules Trae Young would be amazing. Constantly looking for fouls that will never come. Rather than the NBA where he gets them all.
&gt;Trae Young has the charisma and popularity of a young Steph  That's literally it lmao. They are literally nothing alike.
"Team USA needs more bigs. I love Trae Young, but Johnsons not competing with Young. Young's against Lillard, Holiday, Booker etc"
"Just like on the all nba team. Luka was the only young guy they have respect to. They fucked over Trae, Zion, booker, Mitchell, tatum"
"If that is true, Lloyd Pierce should be fired immediately and Trae Young should be selected."
"Maybe a glimpse into the mentality of new players going forward w/r/t all-star selections and accolades in general.  Moving into an era when there’s just way more talent than awards to go around  (trae young allstar snub great example), we’ll see soon enough how the next generation measures itself.  Should be interesting!"
How did trae young not get the spot
"Someone fill me in, but isn't the USA team down a center and wing? Why the hell would you want to add freaking Ja Morant and Trae Young in this case? People crying over the comments seriously are forgetting that this isn't 2k where you just put whatever player in and it works.   Also we really don't know what players they asked before. If you asked me, there are more players I'd rake over KJ and Javale, but seems like they're the ones available."
"I’m aware thanks, I’ve been following the games. He was playing as a fill-in for the NBA Finals players not actually on the 12 man roster. Kind of a big difference there.  I know the home team fans love their own players but Keldon Johnson over Trae Young and some other players is a joke and you know it."
"I watch a lot of basketball but I honestly had to look up who Keldon Johnson is. I guess I'm not watching a lot of Spurs games.   Trae Young is available and wants to play, and he just torched people in the playoffs. The fact that he's not part of the team makes no sense."
Played Trae Young in pickup in Norman. Dude is so fast it’s insane. People don’t realize how much faster these guys are.
Imagine being so talent rich that you don't pick Trae Young for your national team after what we just witnessed over the last month lmao.
"Yeah, there is definitely more to this story than just what’s happening here.   I remember a few statements that were made in 2019 about Popps wanting to reward guys that trained with team USA for FIBA.   Young is a super confident player who has basically always played like he is the best player on the court. With that mindset things like playing for the USA select team was something he probably thought was under him when someone like Popps would view it as a stepping stone to the national team.   Realistically there was no excuse for Derrick White over Trae Young in 2019 too."
"Seems like there has been some beef for a while with Trae.   In 2019, Trae dropped off the selects team after a minor eye injury shortly after not being named to the senior team (I think the promoted Fox over him). This could have potentially lead to a bit of a spat between Trae and USA basketball.   After that, Trae has kindof been embracing a villain type role in the NBA, and while entertaining could be seen as a bit of an issue for Team USA.   Finally, Lloyd Pierce is on Team USA’s coaching staff, so there is reason to believe that Young and Pierce’s relationship kept Young from getting asked too."
why didn’t they add or ask trae young… especially if they need a guard since beal left
That Donte Divincenzo (skip Bayless) and Derrick White (r/Spurs) were better than Trae Young
"I'm not going to jump in to any of the arguments here, but I think it's fun to think about that the draft would be if you froze them in time as prospects-- so Doncic is the young leader of Real Madrid, not the NBA All-Star.   Would the top 10 have gone Zion, Morant, Ayton, Bagley, Doncic, JJJ, Trae Young, Edwards, Wiseman, Barrett?"
"Pop choosing his own player in Keldon Johnson over other, better young American guards like Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, or even LaMelo Ball is just laughable. Not that I'm surprised after Pop chose Derrick fucking White over Fox for the terrible 2019 FIBA team lol what a joke."
Keldon Johnson over Trae Young and Ja Morant.  Are we trying to lose?
"jesus man you need to calm down.   i’m not blind so i’ll concede that this is an interesting decision to make, especially given the optics. and i know you’re probably upset about the fox situation which is understandable.  that said, we don’t know jack shit about the situation and what goes into making these decisions. first off, they’re promoting a player that has been practicing with them on the select team this whole time. additionally, he has played pretty well in the minutes he’s gotten. he’s not a trae young-level talent but he’s solid.   not to mention the fact that we don’t know what players were offered roster spots and which weren’t. tons of players denied the opportunity to play, including high profile guys like steph and lebron. it’s not crazy to assume some guys like trae and fox were offered a spot and declined without rushing to social media to post about it.  i think it’s fine to be frustrated but seems a bit overkill to react in this fashion"
"He was, but it was a minor injury. He ended up playing a few games later. The real reason he won’t be chosen for Team USA is because of Lloyd Pierce, former coach for Hawks, now assistant coach for Team USA, and a perennial Trae Young hater."
trae young top 3 and probably melo before edwards
"Well, there is Trae Young."
&gt;Terrible end to a great career.  Lmao butthurt about derrick white over trae young. Just say  ur bias
This sub seriously looks at that lineup and thinks Pop is a fool for not adding another ball dominant guard that's worse than everyone you listed lmao.  The best think you can add to a roster of KD Dame and Booker is role players not Trae Young lmao
We're talking about a guy who chose derrick white over Trae Young and Dearron Fox lol
Trae Young behind Ant and Melo omegalul
The disrespect some of you have for Trae Young is mind boggling to me. He just led his team to the ECF.
"Yeah let’s just all shit on Keldon Johnson because this is all his fault!!! KJ will literally be perfect for this team, 0 ego, will outwork anyone on the court and will do whatever it takes for his team to win. Of course I want to see Trae Young and some others play but you can say that about literally any olympics team ever…. You think Kenneth Farried was the best available player?? Good to have glue guys with no ego sometimes too boys"
They are pros. They can play in a week. That spot is a bench warmer spot anyway so it should go to a good young talent like trae so he can learn the ropes. Keldon Johnson shouldn’t have been picked over trae young in any universe. This is pop picking Derrick fucking white over fox last year all over again. He has A Track recoord of this shit
"r/nba during the games: we need players that can play a role, hustle, play hard and don’t need the ball in their hands.  Also r/nba: WHY THE HELL DIDN’T YOU ADD TRAE YOUNG, ZION WILLIAMSON, CHRISTIAN WOOD AND DEAARON FOX?"
Would I have preferred if Trae Young or De’Aaron Fox was on the team rather then Keldon Johnson absolutely yes I would
This settles the debate. Keldon Johnson &gt; Trae Young. At least in my unbiased opinion
"Yea it was super suspect.  I don't recall Love being part of team USA since 2012. So I'm not sure what type of veteran experience someone with a 9 year absence would actually provide.   Just by the logic you would think plumlee would get the call bc he has been pretty consistent part of team USA for the last couple of tournaments. Or even melo but here we are.  Also, the reports that Trae young wasn't even asked at this point makes it seem like they are playing favorites and doing solids for people.   I think he got the invite on name recognition in the hopes to boost his trade value out of Cleveland, but he's to wash to even practice with this team."
JaVale might be 1st team All-NBA locker room chemistry. Keldon Johnson...nepotism? Not sure why Trae Young or Ja Morant isn't on this team.
this is what team USA gets for denying us a hilarious julius randle/trae young pairing
"Why isn't Trae Young on this team? Maybe I missed something. I'm not a real fan of him, as a Bucks fan, but as a team USA fan, he'd be a welcomed addition."
Keldon Johnson is an Olympian. JaVale McGee is an Olympian. Trae Young isn't.
"Trae Young is a current superstar.  I really hate to dog pile on a player that Spurs fans clearly have a ton of respect for, but a rotation player on a team that couldn’t make it out of the play in tournament is not what Team USA needs. This is the world stage, not a church league where the coach is going to play his son over clearly superior players."
"When we drafted Aaron Gordon, Hezonja, Jonathan Isaac. The picks above us, Embiid, Porzingis and Trae Young"
"Both fanbases are relatively nontoxic it seems. It's wasn't like Philly and New York where their identity is being douchebags like when they were ""Villainizing"" Trae Young just because he's good and was a little cocky"
"Lloyd Pierce ""Look Trae Young isnt going to happen, literally you can bring anybody else in the country, any all star, hell Id rather coach your boy fucking Derrck White over Trae Young. But I didnt come all the way to Japan to have to see Trae again"".   Popovich turns out literally took him up on that offer."
"Instead of Trae Young and Zion, they are going to take Duncan Robinson and Keldon Johnson…"
"how can you say the team needs shooting and playmaking and then make the case that fit doesn’t matter?   and what do you mean by “send their best”? by what metric? the metric to which they will help win games?  or the ability to stuff the stat sheet?   and Hali has International experience as a lead guard. he’s familiar with Team USA. even though he was a rookie, he was just one year younger than Trae Young, not that huge in terms of experience imo   and trae won’t get that run on this team either. Lilliard is the main ball handler, KD has to get touches, Tatum is there, and right now, Draymond is setting up guys as well as anyone   so if Trae can’t have the ball in his hands 24/7 and make a ton of plays like he does with atlanta, what is he gonna do? he’s gonna play 15 minutes and give you like 2-3 assists (which is good, don’t get me wrong), shoot 45% CnS, but then he’s going to give you the worst defense on the team. he just won’t have the ball enough to make up for his league worst defense    meanwhile, Hali is a 41% shooter, is one of the best ball movers in the NBA, has a 3.4:1 AST:TO, and is switchable as a 6’6 guard with stupid long arms   trae is good, but he doesn’t fit. it’s like miracle"
I think Booker being able to make contorted jump shots and people falling for his pump fake is fine. He’s not doing the Trae Young where he speeds up in front of someone then just jumps when they’re behind so he gets ran over.
"You can’t say what young players will be all time, this is supposed to be sending the best talent in the league.  You’re talking fit as if the team had a long training camp together.  There’s not gonna be a fit, you just Hailiburton did what he did because he played 30 minutes a game. He wouldn’t get that run on this team.  Those players were the best in the league at the time, Trae is one of the best guards in the league. He should be there"
Trae Young pleaaaase
I'm sorry Trae Young
"I'm sure he has the ability to play the small ball 5. I mean, look at Batum in the playoffs. But if he's nervous about dunking when Trae Young and Gallinari are around him, I don't think putting him up against bigger players solves anything. He needs to get his mind right"
"&gt; But still. Bradley Beal is out, they lost a guard. Trae Young just torched the Eastern conference, and no invite still?  ???????  This is what I responded to."
Trae Young and John Collins are available Pop. But first you gotta fire El Pee
"Zion and Trae Young should be the replacements. Maybe Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen should be considered as well because the US needs a traditional big. Some random teams like the Czech Republic will just jam 2 seven footers into the paint, so Brook Lopez would be a guy that could offer good rim protection."
Cool cool now they’re going to recruit young players like Trae and Zion right?
"We’re not talking about the Atlanta offense, we’re talking about Trae Young.  Don’t be doofy.  Would team USA not take Harden because Houston iso’d 90% of the time. The answer is no because you take the best talent.  Youre not making sense  You’re talking about what a rookie bench player does because they have a better starting PG. De’Aaron should be there over Hailiburton"
Time to pickup Derrick white  a.and piss off all the trae young fans lol
I got   Trae young   Jalen Green  Luka Doncic  Devin Booker   Giannis
Anything on Trae Young before the playoffs
"He doesn’t belong between 10-15 either. He’s more 15-20 There’s scorers like him or better who bring more to the table in that range. After the top 11:  Paul George - similar offensive player + good defense and better playmaker  Kyrie Irving - as a scorer, is a better ball handler, 3 point shooter, midrange shooter, and finisher + is a better playmaker  Trae Young - similar scoring numbers but is miles ahead as a playmaker, so he doesn’t have games where he doesn’t make an impact   Jimmy Butler - He had 22/7/7 on All-NBA defense and the best advanced stats of his career this season. I get he struggled in the 4 game sample size this playoffs, but he has shown he delivers in the past.  I’d also take CP3 over him, but I get how Butler and CP3 could be arguable. Booker is in line with Mitchell, Towns, and Beal. Puts him at 15-20"
"I think Luka's hype isn't coming from Euros. I think it's coming from two subsets of the ""Twitter hype highlight crowd""  1. ""WOW, 30PT TRIPLE DOUBLE"" crowd. Ignoring that the entire offense is setup to run through Luka-- he lead the league in USG% in the regular season and the playoffs this year. And as he did so, all the statistical indicators for his teammates fell off a cliff: JRich/Trey/THJ are all at career lows in AST% as they get no playmaking chances. On the other hand, bigs are told to clear the paint to give Luka space to drive. The KP slander crowd is in here too. KP had identical efficiency to Luka in the playoffs and regular season, but while Luka took 5 more shots/game than KP in the regular season, he took 18 shots/game more than KP in the playoffs. People blame his teammates, but the Mavs were a .500 team (positive NetRtg) with Luka on the bench in each of his three years. 2. Luka's amazing highlights. Luka's long range bombs from 3 are crazy to watch. The thing is: he's not Dame or Steph. Luka is a career average 33% 3P shooter (33,32,35 his 3 seasons) on huge volume. He's a 73% FT shooter. He got hot and shot 41% from 3 in the playoffs, and people love quoting that, but it's a small sample size. He also shot 53% on 51 FTA in the playoffs, but I don't expect that to hold up either.  The highlight reels look like Dame or Steph or Harden, but Luka is a below average shooter from 3 and from the line.  Oh and the last one? Luka is young. Lots of NBA fans are young and they're drawn to youth. Trae, Luka, Ja and Zion are all pretty exciting for young NBA fans.  I've been [dying on the hill](https://np.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/kmctfc/atlanta_hawks_are_30_trae_young_averaging/ghf5br2/) of ""I don't see the huge difference between Luka and Trae"" for the last 2 years, even as Luka made 1st team All-NBA last year and Trae missed All-Star."
"Maybe Pop doesn’t like his play style? I don’t watch the NBA anymore, but I’m from Norman, OK so I know who Trae Young is."
I’d take Bradley beals size and length over Trae young tbh. This isn’t rocket science. Trae is good but….what defense can he really play against the world
Max kellerman - trae young is better than Steph curry
Trae Young
"I’d go luka, giannis, Zion, tatum, and Ja in no particular order. I think Trae Young could easily take one of those spots too though.  Edit: take off Ja, put in Jokic"
"I don't give a single fuck Ja doesn't want to go to the Olympics, I'm not even american. Ja is one of the best young prospects in the league, but he's still miles below guys like Zion, Luka, Tatum, Trae, etc.   He'll be a multiple time all star I'm sure, but I don't think he'll ever be the best player in the league, that's all I'm saying."
"Brunson is a good shooter, and one of the 2 players not named Luka that can create his own shot, but he is not a ball handler. Whenever we asked him to play point, our offense resorted on cheap ball movement and isos. It was worse when Rick paired him with Burke. Brunson is at his best when he has someone creating next to him, and he can focus on his pros. Now, we surely won't pay him, and he will command a 15-20m salary on the market. If a team hires him thinking he is Walmart Trae Young, it will flop big time. In the playoffs he just got cold, whereas THJ went supernova. I cannot remember a game where both him and THJ went hot at the same time, usually one of the two would be cold.   About WCS, he is the steroid version of on and off player. He was on during games 3 and 6, but entirely off during the rest of the series, and you can tell which WCS you'll get in the first minute of the guy on court. The KP/big tandem were discovered while we were being murdered by the AD/Drummond tandem, and Rick ran mostly KP/WCS. WCS just wasn't reliable for the Clippers series. Powell got the hustle and rebounding we needed when they went small, but Boban was (a) a mismatch nightmare, specially considering whenever he's playing, Luka consider his life mission to get him going (seriously, watch any Philly game. Luka force feeds Boban so much that he could make a Marjanovic Foie Gras at the end of those games) and (b) a clever way to punt a series without throwing the games away. It was clear to the brass that our roster was lacking when Rick had to give significant post season minutes to Boban, Melli and Burke. With that being said, I would've started Powell as well.   The whole problem funneled to KP. It was KP's lack of hustle that started this snowball. Sometimes it seems that Luka has more control of the paint than the 7'2 guy. We don't know if Rick put KP on the naughty corner because of his passivity, or if his passivity came because he was asked to sit on the wings, but playoff KP was the worst version of regular season KP: chugging logo 3s without any reasoning, avoiding the paint like he's injuried Steph Curry, halting any ball movement just standing there scratching his ass. Watch, if you want, the Spurs series, those games were easily the best he had. He controlled Poeltl like it was a NBA x College game, he absorbed every rebound, he ran the pick with Luka like it was the bubble, then he went ""fuck this"" again. KP is infuriating. I'm hoping that this was a feud with Rick, and Kidd can make amendments, but KP's passivity was what triggered Rick's desperate moves to zag with his big ball when Lue got us cornered. Also, this usually triggers Luka's hero ball games. This is just an eye test thing, but always felt that Luka would try to solve things alone whenever KP went his Cancun mode."
Trae Young because he jacks up so many bricks he makes Iverson blush
"I dont like Trae Young as a person. But, he is right he deserves that shit."
"Locking him up from 23-28, on a contract that will seem much cheaper in 5 years when the cap is way up from a new TV deal. That is a fantastic contract.  Hawks have a great young core locked up, and continuity will do wonders around a great PG like Trae."
"- Cam Reddish wasn’t healthy enough to play until the last two games of the ECF, then lit it up.   - Deandre Hunter only played the first 5 games of the post season   (Those two are bunched together because ATL was a top 10 defense for the first 20 games of the season before they were injured and not having them in the line up together drastically changes the Hawks defensive identity)   - Bogi was injured and effectively a decoy for the final 4 games of the Philly series and first 2 games of the ECF.  If it were the regular season, he wouldn’t have played.   - Trae young battled a shoulder injury against Philly and obviously the ankle injury against the Bucks    That’s 4 out of their 6 or 7 most important players that missed time or were reduced to decoy status because of injury this post season."
"People are a bit too low on Siakam after the bubble + weird Tampa season. The dude has started an all star game, been named 2nd team all-NBA, and been the 2nd banana on a championship team - and he's only 27.  Statistically he's one of the better defenders in the league, he spaces the floor, gives you 21/7/5, and people act like he's some scrub because he struggled as the focal point of the offense.    Hawks have Trae young - almost a perfect complimentary player.  Trae, hunter, bogdanovic, siakam, capella, Gallo, okongwu - that's a helluva squad"
"His 3 point shot was so inconsistent that he made more threes then some scrubs named Trae Young and Steph Curry  Edit: I dunno why I typed Steph, meant Khris Middleton"
"Trae Young, Nick Young, Carl Jung, don't matter. Too Young."
"Being barely ""servicable"" when you were taken #2 over Luka Doncic, Trae Young, and SGA among others is about as big a miss as you can make lmfao."
Octagon lost Trae Young and Kevin Huerter's agent to Klutch Sports sometime last year.  Agencies are kind of a mix bag but if I were a player I'd sign with Klutch Sports undoubtedly
Jayson Tatum and Trae Young the only ones who have taken their teams to a conference finals
"Yo NBA discussions is the next sub over... And he can still develop, he's young, but not everyone is Trae Luka and book bro"
"It’s so weird and frustrating to me that he can’t seem to break through to that level. Lightning quick athlete who can really shoot from deep, and seems to be a smart player, incredibly easy to support and root for, but not a superstar.    I really like him and hope we can get to winning with him, but he just seems to not really have a switch that he can flip and go and take over in winnable games. And I’m not talking about the final few possessions or something. More like the last 5~ minutes where you’re either making a final push to catch up or trying to maintain a lead. I feel like that’s where things got ugly for the Bulls in a lot of games this year.   Zach can get incredibly hot and win games with his ludicrous offensive output, but from what I’ve seen of him, he just isn’t great at going and getting a couple of buckets in close games. He valiantly tries, but it feels like he usually ends up taking a contested or off balance shot from mid-range or 3 that rarely goes in during those moments. The type of shot that you just feel your body disagree with the moment you realize he’s not pump-faking anymore and just lets it fly.  The ability to slow down, control, and take over a game on your own in crunch time is IMO, probably the most crucial attribute to be deemed a superstar in the NBA. Devin Booker, Trae Young, and Luka are all young players that I’ve seen to possess that ability. I feel like you have this confidence when watching them operate in close games, where you know that they’re going to get value out of their possessions. They’re just in control.  I’m more than open to hearing why I’m wrong, as I definitely didn’t watch every Bulls game this season, but I have watched a lot of Zach being the first option for the Bulls, and these are my objective reactions/observations about his game. He’s still a really talented offensive player who can average 25, but I want him to do that in a way that’s conducive to winning a lot of basketball games."
Trae Young
"I feel there are a lot of budding superstars that would definetely take center stage once the great ones retire.   Obviously Zion, Jason Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Trae Young are just a few names that come to mind."
Jimmy Butler was better than Trae Young last year and arguably still was this year.
"Are you looking at the average for the league...or by position..? It doesn't make sense to lump the power forwards and centers in there. Amongst guards he's actually better than guys like Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Drose, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Westbrook"
Bulls dont have anyone as good as Trae Young
What’s the rule unofficially created for Trae Young?
"My prediction for regular season standings.  1. Atlanta Hawks (so much depth and young guys who improve each year - expecting leaps from Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Okongwu)  2. Brooklyn Nets (load management)  3. Miami Heat (improved at PG and PF as well as getting more depth)  4. Milwaukee Bucks (lost some depth and will most likely coast)  5. Philadelphia 76ers (locker room drama / Simmons)  6. Chiacgo Bulls (Zo2 for MIP)  7. Boston Celtics (Who is their PG??)  8. Charlotte Hornets (Great young core, LaMelo will be an All Star)"
"He literally played one game in that series before getting hurt  and had to guard Trae Young, who is a quick pg and someone he never should have been assigned to guard"
As a Knicks fan:  They'll learn one day. I hate Trae Young..but I wouldn't if he wasn't extraordinarily talented.
And Trae Young is a superstar.
"He has, but he’s still useful.  He’s smart, he’s always in the right spot, he gets offensive rebounds, and he led the league in corner 3s.  It’s really his defense that has fallen off, but he’s passable as long as your coach doesn’t ask him to guard Trae Young 1:1 (hypothetically)"
"Ok, this will be a combination of history and recency bias, and some might be in more than one category. Probably forgot someone, dont want to offend anyone.  If you just want to be happy, you can go with well run teams, big markets, always get good Free agents: Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Celtics  If you prefer smaller market teams, but still solid and well runned, that will thrive with good young players you can watch develop (those teams are in very different stages right now): Bucks (current champs have a phenomenal player in Giannis), Spurs (just removed from 2 straight decades of greatness), Jazz, Grizzles, Nuggets (have the current MVP in Jokic), Hawks, Pacers, Raptors (Won the NBA two years ago, but everybody left), Blazzers (Its Dame)  You can go with bigger markets that haven’t found much success lately and were relatively poorly run: Nets (that are actually great right now), Bulls, Sixers, Knicks  You can go with a young player you like right now, I would watch some highlights and see which one you like the most: Pelicans (With Zion, just a freak of nature), Mavericks (with Luka, my favorite player today, watch him with Slovenia in the olympcs), Hornets (Lamelo), Grizzlies (Ja), Hawks (Trae, but already a solid team), Pistons (just got the 1# pick in Cade), Suns (Booker, but they are also pretty solid right now), OKC ( with SGA and around 900 future 1st round picks in the coming years)  If for some reason you prefer smaller markets, kind of stuck in no mans land: Magic, Cavs (you can hope lebron returs again), Wizards  Teams in weird situations: Rockets (Had a super star, traded him, kind of have draft picks, have some young talent and some vets with huge contracts)  If you just don’t like winning that much, you can go with the teams that will always find a way to lose even if their situations seems good: Timberwolves, Kings and Clippers  My team is the Heat, and I really like it. Is a well run big market team, good at drafting,  great in free agency and have a hard working culture. Today the team has a mix of young talent in Bam and Herro and some tough but great vets in Jimmy and Lowry.  Hope it helps."
Young Rondo is much more likely to dunk on trae young 2 feet from the basket than Simmons.
"Lol the Hawks were not healthy at any point last season. Hunter missed the last two series, Bogi was playing hurt, OO had a torn labrum, Trae missed half the Bucks series,etc. You could argue the Hawks are top 3 in the east if they are healthy and they get marginal improvement from a couple of the young guys."
"You're not wrong, but Trae needs to stop being seen as ""the guy who shouldn't have gone before Luka"" and start being seen as ""an incredible young star on a promising trajectory, and an intensely entertaining player and personality"". The Hawks would likely be better with Doncic, but they still did had a great pick in Trae, and I agree with everyone else, it's high time we stop bringing up the trade."
"Trae Young but it isn’t really officially named after him.   Derrick Rose rule: Rose won his MVP while playing on his rookie contract, allows young stars in the NBA to qualify for a higher maximum salary–30% of the cap instead of 25%–early in their careers.  Arenas Provision:  Put in the 2005 CBA to help teams to keep their young restricted free agents who aren't coming off rookie scale contracts. Think Lakers/THT is the most recent example."
James Harden walked so that Trae Young could run
Trae Young (among others) just did it with the new foul baiting rules.
Kyle Korver was making All-Star when Lebron was there lmao while Trae Young couldn't even make it this year
"Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Ja Morant aren't superstars."
"Lol that's because everyone he named are *CLOSE* (not hands and wingspans though obv) to regular sized human beings.  People often forget how HUGE Luka is because they're constantly watching him get clamped down by NBA-sized talent.  But compared to Trae...?  He's a giant.  I doubt Young relates their two games whatsoever because how could you at his height?  Just because they pull similar types of calls doesn't mean those calls aren't achieved in entirely different ways.  TLDR: Luka is a substantially larger human.  And his talent adjusts his game in ways Trae has never, nor ever will be able to consider."
He put up 10-7 on elite efficiency as a 20 year old rookie before Trae Young was there so that makes no sense.
"5 finals appearances, 3 titles, 2 MVP’s and 2 scoring titles all in five years? Plus he’s the only player to average 26 ppg in the finals for the winning team without winning finals MVP - and that’s happened all three championships. Better return on investment than the other $200 million men Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert and Trae Young combined"
"I’m a Bucks fan but there are certain players that I enjoy watching such as Lillard, Trae Young and Jokic, as long as they’re not playing the Bucks, I like seeing those guys, and their teams win"
"I mean, I saw how ya’ll acted when Trae Young took the Knicks out but okay 🤷"
"There isn’t much to his game besides dunking off Trae assists, and shooting the wide open 3. He is a average to below average defender with absolutely no ball handling skills. GMs took notice. Fans like to hype young players up."
Trae Young is the Great Value Reggie Miller
Trae Young.
"Trae Young, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Jrue, Dame, Steph, Ja Morant, and then I guess it’s who you like more between Lowry, Russ and Conley for 8th.  Some might also like those guys over Ja but I thought Ja took a major leap near the end of last season and it could be me just projecting how good he could be."
trae young is a great player but he flops and foul baits and this is a hill i will die on
"Being the best for one season doesn't make you a superstar, Rich Gannon won MVP and he wasn't a superstar. Russell Wilson has never won an MVP but he's still a superstar player. The term superstar isn't a sports term in origin, which is why it is not a fully merit-based term. A superstar is someone of wide fame who is also successful. They don't necessarily have to be the best, but sometimes they are. Mike Vick is a superstar because he was an entertaining and unique player, he was always amongst the highest paid jerseys, he put the Atlanta Falcons in the spotlight, he had many many young kids wanting to be like him, and even had his own shoe. Matt Ryan just isn't that type of guy, his personality type and playstyle just isn't someone that a city like Atlanta will embrace unlike Trae Young who is a superstar in Atlanta. There were many people who were wanting to draft Matt Ryan's replacement this year"
"That’s your own biased perception. Trae has plenty of public supporters, like the great Nick Young or Rashad Phillips"
Without JC the hawks are betting their season on capela . You are losing an essential part of Trae young offensive schemes
"Hawks are not gonna be the perennial contenders people make em out to be if they're already having to pay their over achieving young core the super big bucks.  Trae is wort hit, but Collins is not. Hopefully for the Hawks the lack of cap space left out there by other teams makes it easier."
"ESPN: ""Trae Young says that Luka Doncic is overrated. Will never be a Hall of Famer."""
"I disagree  Plumlee one is actually the deal I am fine with and actually quite like. Cody Zeller, while better on both ends, was gonna leave, he made it clear. We needed a stopgap early doors and Mitch got one while also moving up twenty spots in the draft to select imo the best value pick of the four selections with JT Thor at 37  While Plumlee is very poor on defense, he at least brings similar stuff to Cody on offense with his athleticism and drive and kick ability. His contract is fine too    -----   Not extending your 23 lottery pick guard after he has shown improvement on both sides of the ball year after year is just so shortsighted   Devonte' too, like whatever, we got a lotto protected first. But now we're stuck with what Brad Wanamaker? Grant Riller? as the backup. George Hill is worse than both those players  The fact is all the reasonable free agents we can get are worse than Monk/Te' in my opinion    ----   All of his decisions I would deem more acceptable if it's clear we were going on a rebuilding route, but then the question becomes if you're rebuilding why sign Hayward, who has hay and chalk making up his knees, to 30m AAV while also waiving and stretching Batum (the most ridiculous thus far).    We are reeking towards mediocrity (like at best a 6 seed) for the next couple years or so unless LaMelo becomes idk someone like a Trae Young level player of impact on the offensive end. And while he is a very very promising point guard, I'm skeptical that we have anyone on our roster who can go get you 25+ PPG and be a superstar like that"
"ESPN: Trae Young says Luka is beyond reach for him; better to compare with AI, Nash and others players that never won a championship."
"Also AD, Kawhi, PG13, Bradley Beal, Zion Thrilliamson, Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, The Great Hardini, Kyrie, Westbrook...there's loads of players we could have sent to demolish the world on short notice. I'm kinda wondering why Zion didn't go. The Great Chonky One would have been un-fucking-stoppable with these rules."
ESPN: Trae Young does not think Luka will become an all time great
"ESPN: Trae Young says Luka is beneath him; competing with AI, Nash, and others"
"Fr tho, one is just saying the truth while Simmons took it personally. Guy wouldn’t even shoot it wide open under the basket because paint defensive beast Trae Young was within 3 feet"
Him &amp; KD are so soft online. The fan was spot on. We know he wasn’t gonna shoot. Man’s was scared to layup over Trae Young fearing he’d get fouled and have to shoot free throws. Instead of replying to trolls he should be trying to improve so Embiid doesn’t have to carry his pile of Bricks up and down the court.
They lost to prime Bron.  Y’all lost to 3rd yr Trae Young lmao
&gt;teams are going to feel really stupid when he cracks .500 with his free throw shooting  Certainly! If he manages to gather all his courage to dunk on Trae Young next season those teams will fire their GM
Bill is still my go to for entertaining basketball discussion but my issue with the dude is that his ego won’t let admit he was ever wrong with his takes. I.e Devin Booker and Trae Young as two recent examples.   I’d appreciate him more with a bit of humility but that’s not his style.
"Many reasons. For one, Collins and Young have reported had issues for years now, Hawks we’re always gonna have to choose eventually. Also a veteran presense in ATL could take them over the top.. they’ve been willing to move on from Reddish which opens up the wing play for Demar, plus the excess of shooting on ATL makes up for DD’s lack of a 3pointer. He immediately becomes a high level second level creator to take pressure off of Trae. Also the Spurs have had their eyes on Collins all free agency."
\*However Trae Young is not good enough to play on the USA basketball team. They prefer a roster with zero point guards on it.
Giving Trae Young a $$$himmy
"This is SidetalkNYC, is Trae Young valid?  NO! FUCK TRAE YOUNG!   Joke's aside, good for him!"
the trae young strategy
hOw CoUlD tHeY tRaDe LuKa To DrAfT tRaE yOuNg?
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
Same could be said for Simmons if you just put Trae Young on him
Trae Young is Olympic Patty Mills but all the time
"That person was referring to when Steve Nash said ""that's not basketball"" after Trae Young drew a ridiculous foul on the nets."
Woj: Trae Young laser focused on securing the bag.
Trae Young money
"But yeah, ATL hasn't had any stars in sports yet somehow Trae Young qualifies"
"Definitely not for young stars/faces of the franchise like SGA and Trae. The issue will come with second-tier guys, like John Collins is going through now with Atlanta."
So Trae young isn't actually eligible yet?
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/trae-young-hawks-likely-to-agree-to-five-year-170-5-million-max-extension-per-report/  This article briefly explains it.
Still 1st round ceiling imo. Luka isn't a superstar who can carry a team deep in the playoffs like someone like Trae Young.
"Starting PG on the best team in the East is a washed up role player? Rivers always elevated his play in the playoffs and would have brought some much needed experience to the floor for the young Knicks team.  Jordan lost to the Magic after not having played for over a year and a half, including the entire previous season. That’s what allowed an injured Knicks team to even make the finals. Talk about a cakewalk for Houston.  And don’t even try to say Barkley wasn’t hurt. His injuries were season-long and much more significant than Trae and Kyrie’s rolled ankles.  And if 32-year olds are washed up, I’ll be nice and not even mention how old Husky Harden will be later this month."
Now they can get swept by trae young instead
"I’m honestly surprised how Atlanta isn’t big yet in the nba. I work in the music industry and a lot of people are leaving LA, NY, Miami and Toronto for Atlanta. NBA is predominantly black, and Atlanta has a sizable African American population. You guys also have trae young and a nice solid upcoming team, I expect the hawks to be a destination sooner then later"
No no see Jimmy Butler doesn’t shoot logo 3s like Trae Young. Also wtf is defense?
"I'm also rooting for Slovenia. Luka is my second favorite young player in the league behind Trae, such an unreal talent"
I watched him get clamped by Trae Young.
"Trae has more twitter and Instagram followers (trae has like 4x as many followers) when it comes to who follows and seeks out trae young it seems like he has the edge in mainstream popularity at the moment   I do understand social media followers aren't everything,  but in this case I feel it shows who has a stronger foothold in the public consciousness"
This guy’s complete lack of offense let Trae Young relax on D in the playoffs
"They still might need to lure another star on top to be true Finals contenders as more &amp; more star studded teams are formed down the line, and *then* pay all that luxury tax.   This is obviously the right move for the Hawks, don't get me wrong, but we say every young team is gonna contend for a long time based on one decent run without realizing how tough that is long term.  Gonna be tough, but maybe Trae and company will be able to make ATL a place a couple stars will choose over LA, NY or Miami."
Josef Martinez Ronald Acuña Jr Trae Young Calvin Ridley
"And trae Young isn't in the same category as James, Curry, KD, etc. So what's your point."
Is that scuffed trae young?
"The idea that keeps coming to me is…Hawks sign and trade Collins to Sacramento for Barnes and Bagley.   I like Collins, but with the increased mouths to feed they aren’t even gonna run anything for Collins. He’s just gonna get whatever Trae feeds him on lobs and 3s. I feel Bagley can do that. And Barnes, who’s really just included for $, low key would be nice as a small ball 4 also.  For Sacramento you add to your young core and he gets more responsibility, pretty much guaranteed 18 and 8 minimum, and out of the Bagley headache"
This is why I have the salary cap.  There are zero other ways in which Trae Young and Michael Porter Jr would be getting the same extension.
"tbf, that's just sort of what you sign up for when you draft someone as good as Zion right away. Mitchell's signing accelerated the timeline of a Utah team that people thought would be tanking after Hayward left, and after his sophomore season they went all-in with the Conley trade and Bojan signing. Luka being as good as he is has done the same thing for the Mavs. Hawks wouldn't have gone after Bogdanovic, Capella, or Gallo if Trae Young didn't pop off as a rookie and a sophomore. That's just what happens when you draft someone with the potential to be a superstar nowadays."
"Not really. We’ll be going to the next era of Luka, Giannis, Trae Young, Booker, Ja Morant and so many more talents"
"for Ben Simmons we just want Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Zion Williamson, Ben Simmons and 5 first rounders from the Timberwolves."
"What he lacks in rim protection, he definitely makes up for in perimeter defense. Ben Simmons had some blocks against Trae Young on the perimeter that I don't think Draymond could ever make."
Rudy not afraid to dunk on Trae Young tho
"[He's a ball hog in the regular season too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-lbmsrMbJ0)  Luka's the new westbrook. He'll put up flashy stats because he hunts them, but isn't gonna be a winning player. Trae Young on the other hand actually makes his teammates better, and will actually win championship(s) in his career."
"if im trae young i would just hold out and try to make all nba next season. He can get that same 168 next season, even more because the cap rises. At best he makes all nba and gets the luka 5 year 201 million."
Nobody wants to play with luka because he's a ball hog. And he's not the most promising young player. Tatum and Ice Trae are better.
We just going to ignore Nets had Kyrie and Harden injured and Trae Young was missing a little LOL
How does paying a guy $40 million who won't dunk the ball over Trae Young and refuses to work on his shot help their rebuild?
"Why would they not bother pressing you as soon as the ball touches your hands, it's a free steal. You can't dribble or lift the ball outside of the fetal position without the shittiest defender in the league grabbing it out of your hands. Trae young and bryn forbes would bully the fuck out of you"
"First of all I'm not going to talk about what you said about Lowry. Secondly, Green was a starter when he was healthy. thybulle was the 6th man, and helped make trae shoot 39% from the field, and maxey gave them decent bench minutes. Remove them and the team has 0 decent depth. Also, Morey probably didn't want to give 4 young cheap assets for half a year of a of Kyle Lowry, who isn't gonna put them over the nets"
"Definitely watch some historical clips over the years to watch how the game started and has developed. I personally recommend starting around the 80s and watching some highlights of the Celtics and Lakers match-ups, especially their finals match-ups. Detroit in the late '80s brought an overwhelming defensive presence to the game which changed things up a bit. Then of course you have to watch the greatness that was Michael Jordan in the 90s, the double three-peat.   After that you'll be caught up to the 2000s where things are a lot more current and familiar. Assuming you don't know but the Lakers (Shaq and Kobe) and San Antonio Spurs were the powerhouse teams in the early 2000s, followed by a power move by the Celtics in 08 to form ""the first"" ""Big Three."" I personally believe this move  by the Celtics is what has powered a lot of the motivation behind free agency/trades over the last decade plus. Around that same time was the rise of LeBron James, widely regarded as the second-best player (or best, depending who you are talking to) to Michael Jordan. LeBron James' move to the Miami Heat started his Finals dominance the last decade which was very entertaining to watch as he showed up in the Finals nine out of ten years from 2011-2020 with the Heat, Cavaliers, and now Lakers.   The Golden State Warriors rose as a titan in 2015 and began their reign, with Steph Curry greatly evolving the game by extending the expectations of 3 point shooting. Kevin Durant, regarded as the current second-best player to LeBron James in the NBA, joined the Warriors in 2016 and formed what was known as the ""Hampton Five"" - which was arguably the best line-up in the history of the NBA. Kevin Durant left the Warriors after 2019 for the Nets, which brings us to today's game (upcoming year) where there has been somewhat of a vacuum left by the Warriors from the last decade, in which several teams are in-contention (including the Warriors, I think) for the upcoming years to establish a new dynasty.   James Harden's trade from the Rockets to the Nets was regarded as the largest move last year and many expect Brooklyn to take home the championship in the next 1-2 years. It is a great time to get in the game as there are many young players on several teams who are still blossoming as the leaders of their franchises and are expected to join the ranks of the elite like Trae Young on the Hawks, Zion Williams on the Pelicans, and now you could say Cade Cunningham on the Pistons - while we are still watching the rise of other potential all-time greats like Giannis on the Bucks, Joel Embiid on the Sixers, and Luka Doncic on the Mavericks.  Great time to get into the sport and hope you enjoy it!"
"Celtics getting Trae Young, John Collins, Magic City and at least 2 of the Migos."
"hes not the lone all star, middleotn is a two time all star. And seth partnow has jrue ranked as a top 25 player and on the same level as trae young when u factor in his defense. he has a great supporting cast. Its not on the same level as the nets but it probably is on the same level as the lakers when you factor in fit."
"How many teams even currently have their best player as a point guard? Irving isn't, Chris Paul is arguable but no, Westbrook definitely isn't now.  Unless you are calling Doncic or Harden a point guard like you sometimes see to fill out PG lists it's a bunch of middling teams and then only 3. Steph, Dame, and Trae. And if Trae Young is a superstar it's very new argument (that I don't buy)."
Trae young already made an all star team
Trae Young has made an all star team
"Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, SGA, Ja Morant, are all better than Brogdon."
"Trae Young, SGA, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, and KAT would be my starting lineup."
2021 Finals would have been  Lakers:  PG: Ja Morant  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: LeBron James  PF: Anthony Davis  C: DeAndre Ayton  vs  Knicks:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Ben Simmons  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Karl Anthony Towns
Luka  SGA  Collin Sexton  Ayton  Mikal Bridges  MPJ  Jaren Jackson Jr.   Trae Young  If the Kings rejected a 1 to 1 swap of any of those players I would riot.
"Passing is largely subjective. Most objective metrics like Backpicks have Jokic as the best passer in the NBA.  It's hard to categorize players as passers. For me MPJ is a bad passer, Giannis is an average passer, Monte Morris is a good passer and Trae young is an elite passer. Backpicks Passer rating is probably the most advanced metric out there to judge passing ability but, even that is not all encompassing."
"To some extent that's true but there will always be players like Chris Paul, Trae young, and Kyle Lowry that are ~6'0"" but with ball skills and basketball IQ that make them more valuable than many players that are larger and more athletic."
"It’s like this across sports. More televisions and phones + social media = more fan engagement. More fan engagement = more merchandise sold, more spectators, thus higher tv deals = rising salary cap  Drew Brees was the first QB to get a $100m contract *11 years ago* and now, you see rising starts like Jackson and Allen commanding $300m contracts.  Luka Doncic will probably end up making (grossing) more money than Lebron by the team he’s 30 than LeBron ever made in his career.   Luka is 22 and he’s on a $200m contract, he’ll be eligible for another supermax by the time he’s 27/28 and likely *another* supermax.   We will see NBA superstars gross nearly a billion dollars when their careers are done. Just wait another 5 years when Trae Young, Luka, Tatum, Caruso, Booker, and Mitchell are the premier players in the league. They will all benefit the most from rising salary caps"
&gt;Trae Young looks like my dad's dick! ^(...wait)
"Her strongest stories were about Boston, and I wouldn't be surprised if she retired because Danny Ainge, her main source, is no longer with the team. But she wrote plenty about other young players outside of Boston.  I remember she wrote this awesome piece about Jamal Murray a few years back and now she consistently brings up the Nuggets. Same with a Trae story recently. Once she does a write-up of a player, you can hear how often she stays in their corner.    Of any journalist who consistently appears on ESPN podcasts, she gives the most leeway to young players."
No team can match their depth. They are all young and have a ton of potential. If they can get a second option without sacrificing much depth then they could win it all in a year or two. Trae seems to still have a lot of growth potential and could be a super star. Devolopment will determine a lot. But they have the most exiting squad in the league rn.
"If it's just players who weren't All-Stars last year, I'd take Trae Young"
Trae Young
Because Draymond can dunk on Trae Young.
"Maybe he set records in his conference, he didn't set actual records. Just off the top of my head Trae Young and Kevin Durant both had higher scoring averages as freshmen."

Trae young got hurt too. Hawks prob win if he plays
"I don’t think we’re contenders. But anything short of another ECF appearance should not put our run in question. We had the second best record in the league once McMillan took over. We dealt with injuries all regular season, and had one relatively healthy series vs NY (still missing Reddish) and we see how that went. Beat Philly without Hunter. You can keep saying Philly beat themselves but it was Lou Williams and Trae Young who took over and practically didn’t miss down the stretch. We created our own momentum. The team believed in themselves no matter the odds.  Now the East is stronger. We could very well end up a first round exit to a good team. That would be frustrating, considering the internet would label us a “fluke” but our window isn’t now and outside of Bogi and Capela our main group is 23 and under. I think we’re the only playoff team that can say that, so if we play the cards right and choose the right young players to keep, we have a good amount of time. If we fall short, I’d chalk it up to the East getting better. We didn’t make many changes: this group fell short to the eventual champions and we had injuries to Hunter Trae and Reddish, so it only makes sense to gift them one season to run it back and see what’s really there. Maybe what’s there got surpassed by other teams this off season, or maybe we’re good enough to go the distance. We’ll see.  Unless we get swept handily in the first round, I don’t think the Fluke card is on the table."
"Couldn’t that same statement have been made for a bunch of guys just last year? Booker, lavine, Trae young? They had all the haters just like you’re doing now and nothing changed year over year besides their team finally putting pieces that are solid around them.  Last year towns was healthy he was the second best player on a good team. 3 seed before butler got hurt"
"Hawks are about to knock some heads off this year. Trae Young vengeance tour coming to an arena near you. 2nd seed and a trip to the finals this year.  The takes saying they’re not going to be competitive for a chip are hilarious. A healthy Trae closes out game 3, is up 3-1 on the bucks and closes out the series in 6. This Hawks team is solid at every position, twice… the backups would be starters on most teams."
Good young team Trae is legit
"Trae Young didn't even make the All-Star team last year and even just in terms of fan votes has way fewer than Jokic. I would argue Randle and Tatum as individuals aren't that popular, they just happen to benefit playing for the Knicks and Celtics; replace either of them with like a Sabonis or someone and we'd be arguing whether he's more popular than Jokic (yes I realize that's a massive judgement call on my part but it's how I see it)."
"Luka Donic, Donovan Mitchell, and Trae Young.  All 3 way more popular than Jokic."
"Trae Young, Booker, Luka, KD, Lebron, Steph, Giannis, Taytum all more popular. That's 8/10 teams right there.  Randle is the only one ""less popular"" and even then it's an argument. But purely because he's the star player of the Knicks."
Oh no. It appears Trae Young is guarding him. Ben dumps the ball off to Drummond who gets fouled and bricks two free-throws.
"Just put Trae ""6'1 Mutombo"" Young on help defense, Simmons will score precisely 0 points"
"Points team wrecks shop.  Steph, Giannis, and Dame are all top flight playmakers, and everyone other than Giannis can space the floor well.    On the other team, Westbrook and Draymond both offer negative spacing with Luka’s shooting known to be inconsistent as well.    Not to mention from a pure talent standpoint, the points team are all just straight up better than their counterparts with the possible exception of Jokic vs. Embiid.    Then matchup wise, there’s just a massive mismatch going on defensively.    The biggest defensive mismatch in the favor of the Assist team is at the shooting guard position, with Trae Young being a legit threat matching up against Dame’s spotty defense.    But that’s not much when you consider that the Points team is going to have Giannis going straight at Westbrook/Doncic/Jokic all night surrounded by shooters including Stephen fucking Curry.  The Assist team’s starters just arent prepared to deal with that.  They’d have to keep Draymond in to keep Giannis from running over the game.  However, that means on the other end you’re allowing either Embiid or Giannis free reign to camp the paint, which would basically make Westbrook useless in terms of scoring.  So now you have 2 guys on the floor who can’t score at all and a pass first point guard in CP3, leaving Trae Young and Jokic to try and keep up with 6 of the best scorers in the NBA.    It just wouldn’t work out on any level for the Assist team unless the entire Points team just miraculously goes on a 2018 Rockets level cold streak."
"""Hello, PPD...Trae Young is trying to block my shot come here and save me"""
"I would love to talk smack at these guys, but I also said similar things about trae young and boy I have been wrong 😂"
Can't blame Ben here. Few men can attack the rim when Trae 'Dikembe Mutombo' Young is in their way.
"Trae Young is 6'1 Ben, they stat paddin him"
Unless Trae Young is on help defense   Does Simmons have too many yes men around him?
Yeah but can he do it while shot blocking god Trae Young is in the vicinity during the Eastern Conference Semifinals?
Trae Young is probably a tight 5’11” tbh. “They stat padding him” as Rdc doc rivers would say
Trae Young thinks Steve Nash is the GOAT lol
"i mean it's marketability so every team makes sense:  New York Knicks vs. Atlanta Hawks -- NY is not an absolute garbage team anymore + Trae Young  Milwaukee Bucks vs. Boston Celtics -- Champions + Celtics (duh)  Phoenix Suns vs. Golden State Warriors -- Finals (this one I can see being iffy, but they do have Devin Booker) + Everyone knows the Warriors and Steph  Los Angeles Lakers vs. Brooklyn Nets -- Lakers (duh) + Big 3  Utah Jazz vs. Dallas Mavericks -- Jazz I have no fucking clue, I mean this could easily be the Nuggets I suppose + Luka"

"&gt;If they have a weakness, it's the inability of the backcourt to get stops, primarily players like Trae Young and Lou Williams.  &gt;Playoff teams will probably always work to get Young or Williams on a switch before attacking, so exploring a trade for a big, defensive-minded guard (a la Marcus Smart) would do a lot for this roster.   Lmao this is actually so fucking dumb I cant believe these ppl get paid to write.   1. Trae and Lou will never play together (and actually they did IN THE PLAYOFFS and teams couldnt take advantage)   2. Yeah just go for the switch right? Tell that to the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks who did that maybe a grand total of 3 times. It's so easy and such a good strategy right?   3. Trading for Marcus Smart as if we don't already got ppl to cover for Trae smfh. That's the entire point of our roster construction"
Is Trae Young overrated?
Trae Young
Trae young is a significantly better player at this point.
I'm picking Trae Young if I'm the GM of the Bucks
"Not even close...there's an argument he's not even the best shooter in his draft class. Trae Young has a lower percentage but his shot difficulty is way higher and it's off the dribble, not spotting up like MPJ."
Russell isnt really an efficient scorer anyways but 12% is surprising. You would think Trae Young shot that the way people talk about him.
"I'd rather watch an aging Lebron over Jokic.  I'd rather watch a prime Giannis over Jokic  I'd rather watch the twilights of Curry and KD over Jokic.  That puts Jokic 5th.. and I haven't even mention Luka, Trae Young or Devin Booker."
"2017 McDonald's All-American?   Notable NBA players from West: Trae Young, Ayton, Jaren Jackson, M Porter Jr, Gary Trent, Troy Brown  East: Bamba, Wendell Carter, Sexton, Lonnie Walker,  Mitchell Rob, Knox, Vanderbilt  MPJ was MVP and his team won 109-107"
im talking about trae young. and he didnt actually man up and play his team won without him.
"I mean, being the 4 seed in the east and then getting bounced 4-1 in the 1st round doesn't exactly scream Christmas day game material, otherwise the Joe Johnson Hawks would have had a monopoly on it lmao.   There are probably like 4-5 teams you could argue that are much more deserving, including but not limited to the 76ers, Clippers, and Nuggets.   The Knicks are getting a game because they're the Knicks and they aren't a dumpster fire for first time in like 10 years, and there's a fun storyline of Trae Young vs the MSG crowd.  That being said, like I said to the other guy, if we are gonna have one, I'd rather it be against the Knicks over any other team, so whatever."
"Have a really good fit in Al and some team comes along and just offers him the most ridiculous bag too, straight up lose lose for ainge. They overshot with their young core too so now there's this pressure on them that isn't there for some of the other young cores (no one is mad at Trae/luka for not making the finals, nor should they be)"
"There aren’t players of similar caliber in this scenario, that’s kinda the point.  A top tier scorer that doesn’t play defense can win mvps. A top tier defender that can’t do anything on offense is a role player.   Trae young is only a top 10ish offensive player yet even with no defensive contributions he’s amazing. A top 10ish defensive player with no offense might not even be a starter"
Theres not a single team in the history if the league that would ever choose tony allen over trae young.
Eh I’d say the first is more valuable on a contender and the second is more valuable on a middling team. Not saying Tony Allen &gt; Trae Young but I think they get bonus points in those situations that fit them.
Would you rather have Ben Simmons or Trae Young
"Who would you rather have, Ben Simmons or Trae Young?"
So Ben Wallace vs Trae young
Amazing scorer with awful defense.  I’m basically just assuming this is a Tony Allen vs Trae Young scenario
u/TRAE-YOUNG-BETTER paved the way for up and coming shitposters like myself   May he RIP in pieces
It is my duty to call out the top 3 Atlanta Hawks shitposter on r/nba (RIP Trae-Young-Better)
Trae Young equals the Grinch
The guy who thought 6’1 160 lbs Trae Young was gonna stop him? He could’ve dunked Trae through the rim with the ball. He wanted out
"yea are we even a young core? our 2 best players are 27. We just got some nice young pieces around them, but nobody on the roster is as good as trae/zion as a building block."
Lmao why are we even in this convo I'd trade our entire team for Trae Young or Zion.
"I find ""fit"" to be a really weak argument in terms of Simmons' lack of improvement and playoff production. There's this idea that if you surround Simmons with a murderer's row of shooters he'll suddenly have found his ""perfect fit."" Two problems with that:  1) If he is literally scared to dunk over Trae Young it doesn't matter how much space you give him. Even if you omit that one play, at what point outside of flashes here and there has Simmons ever looked like this dominant interior scorer everyone thinks he'll suddenly become when given space.   2) Great, let's find a bonafide stretch 5, a three-level scoring PG that can play equally well off the ball, and some elite shooters that don't need the ball in their hands. All in service of Ben Simmons. Wait, that team is probably already really fucking good and is more likely to need to fill out their roster on the margins rather than absorbing this $30m player into their cap space.  At this point Embiid has been pretty much the only constant on all of these different iterations of the Sixers that Simmons just somehow hasn't fit on, so in a sense we're basically just blaming Embiid (the guy who's developed into a genuine threat from outside) for Simmons' limitations. While it's true that Embiid likes to play in the post and isn't really a true ""stretch 5"", that just brings up questions of why it's never once crossed their mind to shop Embiid himself. After all Simmons is a young All-NBA talent, and Embiid could bring back an absolute haul.  I'm not slamming the idea of fit, I'm saying that there's a reason people don't twist themselves into knots talking about ""fit"" or lack thereof with other All-NBA guys. The fact you apparently need this uber-talented team all playing in service of Simmons' game to find a ""fit"" for him just gives him less value."
**IS TRAE YOUNG VALID?**  ##**NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
"“Yo, Trae Young looks like my Dad’s dick! I never saw my Dad’s dick… he still looks like shit!”"
Lol if you think anything will make me hate christmas let alone trae young
F*** trae young and balding gonna be the hot menu on that day for sure
he's still a top 30 player though. Westbrook not being made an all star was just politics. Same way Trae Young was technically not an all star last season but is obviously a top 30 player.   There has to be an agreed upon definition for what constitutes a superteam and the Lakers qualify. They have 3 current top 30 players.   Now if Russ stinks this season then okay the expectation was wrong. just like the 2012 Lakers sucked ass they were not a superteam cause the players were washed up. If russ is washed up fine they are not a superteam.   But as of right now that has to be the expectation that Russ plays like he did last season and is still a top 30 player.
"That fragile, old Trae Young."
I wish I could be 6’11 and just run and dunk except when I’m scared to dunk on Trae Young in a playoff game. That takes no skill at all.
Good thing trae young wasn't standing under that hoop
I wouldn't compare Trae Young to Kyrie in terms of efficiency.
Wait isn’t this when amare was like a top 15 player in the league?   I never heard about that. That’s fucking insane. That would be like trying to trade Porzingis back when he was a monster for trae young and then it looking genius in hindsight.
Trae Young &gt; Dame
I wish I could be 6’11 and just run and dunk except when I’m scared to dunk on Trae Young in a playoff game. That takes no skill at all.
"I mean we can expand it to include last postseason for Smart too (so 22 total games) and Fournier’s postseasons the last few years (15 total games). It’s not a great sample size but it’s similar to the one we use when talking about young talent like Trae (16 total career playoff games so far) and Doncic (13).   And in those games, Smart still has a higher ppg on a higher ts% along with more rebounds and assists per game with higher advanced stats across the board. Happy to agree to disagree on who’s better. But there’s certainly a case for Smart."
Deuce is better the Trae Young. No lies detected.
He was most of the reason why dude. What’s the point of playing with words when everyone knows the truth. He’s a #1 pick super max guy at PG and he refuses to shoot or even finish over trae young and can’t hit a fucking free throw. You lost because of Ben.
Trae Young and Hawks fans seemed a bit aggrieved that Pop didn’t want a poor 1 on 1 defender in a switching scheme.  Not that any of those last 3 spots mattered in the end lol.  We were playing like 8-9 guys in the knockout round
God passed Simmons over just like Simmons passed over a dunk on scary Trae Young.
The answer is either knicks nets or Knicks hawks.   Trae Young seems perfect for the Rucker.
"**Atlantic**  Celtics (Brown &amp; Tatum): No  Nets (KD &amp; Harden): No  Knicks (Randle &amp; Kemba?): Probably  76ers (Ben &amp; Embiid): No  Raptors (FVV &amp; Siakam): Yes  &amp;#x200B;  **Central**  Bulls (LaVine &amp; Vuce): Tough but no  Cleveland (...uh Allen &amp; Sexton?): Duh  Pistons (Cade &amp; Jerami Grant): Probably not. Cade interesting  Pacers (Sabonis &amp; Caris): Yea  Bucks (Giannis and Middleton): No  &amp;#x200B;  **Southeast**  Hawks (Trae &amp; Collins): Nah  Hornets (LaMelo &amp; Hayward): I might, yea  Heat (Jimmy &amp; Bam): um no  Magic: Just yes  Wizards (Beal &amp; Dinwiddie): Yes  &amp;#x200B;  **Northwest**  Nuggets (Murray and Jokic): Nope  Twolves (Ant &amp; KAT): Fairest trade so far  Thunder (SGA &amp; Lou Dort): Maybe, SGA is nice, but as a whole package  Blazers: (Dame &amp; CJ): No  Jazz (Gobert &amp; Mitchell): No  &amp;#x200B;  **Pacific**  Warriors (Steph &amp; Klay): No  Clippers (Kawhi and PG13): No  Lakers ( AD &amp; Lebron): No  Suns (CP3 and Book): No  Kings (Fox &amp; I guess Holmes): Yea  &amp;#x200B;  **Southwest**  Pels (Zion and BI): No chance  Spurs (Murray &amp; Young): Yes  Rockets (Wall &amp; Wood): Yes  Grizz (Ja &amp; JJJ): No but close  Mavs (Luka &amp; KP): No  &amp;#x200B;  So I would or might for about 9 teams. But im probably a dummy"
"Compared to this year? Klay, Durant, harden, Murray, cp3, ad, lebron, trae young and kawahi all went down this year. Only the warriors were really injured in the raps run."
"- Lakers vs Bucks - Lebron vs Giannis - Nets vs 76ers - Big 3 vs the Big 3 your mom says they have at home.  - Suns vs Warriors - Steph vs CP3 (OG point gods leading their young teams) - Hawks vs Mavs - Trae vs Luka (the next big rivalry) - Heat vs Jazz - Guaranteed top 4 in their conferences, so gotta put these two teams in there."
"I mean in no particular order: LeBron, Giannis, Luka, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Embiid, Jokic, AD, Dame, Trae Young, PG-13, Tatum, Booker, CP3, Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, and potentially Westbrook, Beal, Klay, Zach LaVine, KAT as well, too.  Give Beal/LaVine/KAT 4 seasons of apex LeBron as a teammate &amp; they absolutely can win a chip."
"Patrick Williams, Michael Porter Jr, and this one may be controversial but if Coby White goes to a place where he can be a first option and primary ball handler he can be VERY good. once his develops his playmaking and consistency shooting the ball he could be a Trae Young type player"
"Imagine being the Hawks and playing every game like its 1st round G2 in MSG and every single one of your players is Trae Young. But when you go back to Atlanta for G3, the crowd somehow hates you even more. Tampa was a shit show and I guarantee you they have removed any consideration of getting a team there."
Trae Young has some of his passing ability.
"Jrue Holiday &gt; Trae Young I was coming into the playoffs preaching this one, but Trae was so good in the playoffs that even tho Holiday won the title, I pretty much had to flip on my own take"
Trae Young
"yea it makes sense if the outcome after the wrong whistle is clear (an immediate shot that goes in), but what if it’s like giannis and he gets the rebound at point blank but hast shot yet and trae young is the only defender or something. obviously that’s gonna be a bucket too, but if he didn’t start the motion it doesn’t count? it’s such an edge case and the rule doesn’t happen often at all but it’s interesting to think about. like i get the the intent is to not interfere with the play as much/not punish the offence or defence with a wrong whistle, but theres a lot of cases where it would be called back anyway"
"Before we start just naming players, let’s think about what kind of skillset we’re looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won’t really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn’t expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I’d be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn’t need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don’t think he’s the WORST player (he’s very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I’m hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he’s obviously young and still developing, so we don’t know what he’ll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6’5”, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous “Big Body.”   P.S. Another interesting question is who’s the BEST player who WOULDN’T succeed on a team of clones of himself. I’d be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it’s hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn’t still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
"Rondo has said he really enjoys mentoring the young guys, was very excited to get to Atlanta and work with Trae, so I imagine he is thrilled to have Ja now."
What's a young socialite to do when he runs into an absolute specimen like Trae Young protecting the rim?
He really does have that trae young type voice
"Trae young beat the juggernaut Knicks, Injured Embiid and afraid to look at the rim Simmons, and got beat by the bucks without Giannis, goat,  Kyrie is just the bum that averaged 30 ppg against the KD warriors, went off for 40 in game 5 on the road, outplayed the 73-9 warriors' best player and hit the game winning dagger to come back down 3-1.   Do you really think everyone would be crying about the nets if it was KD, Harden and Trae instead of Kyrie? Lmfao"
"Legit not trolling, people just don't realize the impact Trae Young has"
"Yes he is. There are 30 starting point guards. If there are 15 starting point guards better than you then you are below average. 15th best is average. I can easily name 15 better than DLO. (Not in order) 1. Curry 2. Luka 3. Dame 4. Kyrie/harden 5. Westbrook 6. Fox 7. SGA 8. CP3 9. Ja 10. Trae 11. Jrue 12. Brogdon 13. Lowry 14. Jamal Murray 15. Conley. There are others that I’d debate as well: Simmons (I get the hate but still a great facilitator and defender), Lamelo (he’s still young but I can def see him being better), Lonzo (good defender and solid shooter/facilitator, I think his defense brings him over DLO), dinwiddie (arguable maybe leaning towards DLO tho), dejounte Murray (DLO is better on offense but his defense is miles ahead of DLO, could outweigh the offense), vanvleet (I think DLO better but vanvleet is up there), Kemba, and Rozier. That’s 15 better and like 8 debatably better. He’s def below average"
"He had a career individual season, but the efficiency did drop off  I love capela, favorite player, so it isn’t a diss when I say that even though last year was the best season for *him*, that 2017-2018 Rockets pairing with harden was genuinely the most effective combo ever  As for best partner in the league right now? Harden is a better player than Trae young so it is probably still Harden, but in like 3 years it’s gonna be Trae and he honestly isn’t far behind at all.  Again, I’m talking efficiency numbers of the lob threat"
Thaddeus would dunk on Trae in an act of Young-on-Young violence.
Trae Young - 68
"&gt; Trae had a lot of hype but Ayton was seen as clearcut number one &gt;  &gt;   Analytics crowd was all aboard Luka as #1, a lot of traditional outlets had Ayton first. It really depends on how you consume NBA media really. If you only listen to Zach Lowe types you would assume Luka was the consensus #1 pick.  Nate Duncan had Luka #1 and Trae Young #2, which looks smart in retrospect."
"Pretty sure Harden has never turned down a wide open finish at the rim at the mere thought of going to the line seeing a flailing Trae Young ten feet away, either."
"I'm taking Donovan over most young stars. Excluding trae and luka, for now"
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10. Embiid 11. Luka  12. Harden 13. Kyrie  14. Tatum  15. Beal 16. Paul George  17. Trae young 18. Jaylen brown  19. Jamal murray 20. Devin booker 21. Chris paul 22. Kris Middleton  23. Jrue holiday  24. Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
"As a Lavine stan, this feels high.   There’s so many talented dudes in the NBA. Like, how do you rank him against Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc? Cause those are guys all outside of the top 15 who play a similar position to Zach."
Trae Young will be the one. I think he'll go absolutely nuclear a few times this season.
Hawks   Trae Young is one of the most exciting players in basketball. Reddish and Hunter are also going to be amazing to watch
"Young isn’t nearly as good a shooter as Tatum? Lmao you smoking crack my boy? Just the fact that Trae can make 30 footers on a 37% clip already means he’s a better shooter, the gravity he pulls from half court is Dame esque  Tatum also has the benefit of playing with another all star shot creator to draw defensive attention."
"#Pass  Would much rather keep Clint Capela as he had a better season offensively and defensively. You could argue the offensive development is a result of playing with Trae Young but its kinda useless to mention that without CP3/ayton.  And although I do believe that Ayton will soon be better, id still much rather have Capela for the next 4 years at $18.5m/yr than Ayton on a frickin max that could be bumped up to $41m/yr if he makes a pair of ASGs or all nba...  What a ridiculous waste of team cap ayton straight up is not that guy (nowhere near it yet, huge gamble to pay him and bet that he grows into it)"
Ja Morant &gt; Trae Young
"Pelicans are garbage and Zion doesn’t seem to be developing. The Timberwolves are the all-soft-hands team. Kings, they are just sad. Pistons are also garbage.   Interesting call about the Hawks, Nate McMillan is consistently the most underrated coach in the NBA, I am glad he has finally found a place that understands this. Trae Young keeps blowing everyone’s expectations, kids an absolute baller.  luka luka luka - I thought he would be an MVP last year but Mavs were disappointing. porzingis is an albatross on the team - remember when he was the savior of the Knicks? Mark Cuban is a good owner though, maybe they swing a crazy trade, Luka is a cornerstone and he just needs the right team around him, he is a perennial top 5 player in the league.  Some other predictions: Warriors win the west, Lakers will be garbage, KD wins the MVP, I have no idea what happens to Simmons and Philly, who will be a surprise team this year? What big trades are coming?"
"It’s not fair tho, Joel didn’t even throw him under the bus he said that Ben’s pass out of the dunk was the turning point of the game…like, how is it at all fair to have THAT comment undue 4 years of support? That’s madness lol he shot 33% from the FT line, he took 0 shots in the 4th quarter of games 5, 6, and 7. He passed up a dunk on Trae young. At some point you have to take responsibility, you can’t blame other people for being honest in the press"
Trae Young vs the world
"Bruh the Hawks 8 best players played 3 minutes the entire season. Trae's team was never healthy to begin with the entire year. Now Bogy is a reliable shot creator, reliable 3 point shooter, Collins is actually a post-up face up typa guy player, Capela once in a while can create his hook shots. Hunter would actually take advantage of his height in mismatches, you know what huerter did in game 7 against the 76ers. plus gallo and lou will with young guys in jalen johnson, and shariffe.  You really think our whole offense is reliant only on Trae. Also due to size, Lavine is obviously more efficient. You cannot compare a 6'6 guard to a 6'0 guard through efficiency too be honest.  and sure let's say lonzo would actually make trae earn his baskets more, collins is gonna take advantage in the post against pwill/derozan, while hunter could easily isolate derozan. yes i do think hunter's iso game is underrated as people only know him through a 23 game sample  You act like the Hawks team ain't deep, in fact they are easily deeper than the Bulls, have a better core imho. Troy Brown Jr will literally not get PT from us, Tony Bradley would probably be cut from is.  The games might get closer, but on paper (as we haven't really see the Bulls do something during the actual season) the Hawks would defeat the Bulls"
SGA &gt; Trae Young
"I've seen a good amount of NBA players up close, Trae Young and Bryn Forbes are the only ones that just look like normal people."
Ben can drive to the basket his only problem is he’ll pass out to someone if there’s an elite rim protector like Trae Young waiting for him there
- The Lakers have established a new blueprint for building championship teams that large market teams will (ab)use until we see another CP3-type block.   - Jokic will be the NBA’s Peyton Manning. Outstanding regular seasons with disappointing post-season runs and very limited championship appearances.   - Trae Young will hang a banner before Luka. You have no idea how much it hurt me to type that being a long time Mavs fan.
Ikr I honestly think it’s only a matter of team. Hopefully Trae young helps change that
that's also a big part of it though it's like a catch-22 because the Hawks haven't really been good enough to be a basketball town. But that's changing now with Trae Young!
"Unrealistic. There’d have to be at least 4 more teams in this deal. LeBron, Khris Middleton, Luka and Trae Young would be involved"
"Jrue Holiday has a higher AST/TO ratio than Jokic, Harden, Trae Young, etc.   Well I wouldn’t believe anything you said regardless, look at your Reddit name lmao.   And every single advanced creation and playmaking stat has the same names at the top: Trae, Russ, Luka, Harden, Bron, CP. All of them."
And Patrick McCaw has won 3 rings. Can't really take you seriously when you believe this guy averaging 1/0.6/0.8 is a better player than Trae Young.
"&gt;&gt;Infinitely better defender &gt; &gt;He's still a shitty defender and who gives a fuck about PG defense anyways lol one of the most overrated ""weakenesses"" on this sub. No one expects Trae or most PG's in the league for that matter to be locking anyone down. &gt;  Nope. And when you're this bad at defense, it absolutely matters in the playoffs, where teams repeatedly abuse bad defenders playing heavy minutes, regardless of position. Another good example was how the Lakers managed to abuse Jokic with Anthony Davis.  &gt;you're listing something he's ""almost"" as good at when asked to name things he's clearly better at... lol &gt;  So? I made it clear he isn't better. Why are you angry at me discussing something that still adds to the comparison of the two.  &gt;&gt;Most importantly he was huge in the playoffs while Trae was underwhelming &gt; &gt;Underwhelming? Is this a bit? Trae had one of the most electrifying debut playoff runs for a young player in recent memory, tf are you talking about? &gt;  I don't agree, but underwhelming might be an overstatement. He was a worse scorer than in the regular season. 31% from 3 for example.  &gt;you're just making up shit for the sake of argumentation, it's cringe bro. I think Luka is a better all around player mainly because of his size and things like switchability but the mental gymnastics people go through to make it sound like they're not even close to each other are so lame. &gt;  Oh no, I'm cringe. How will I ever recover. His size and switchability makes him a better scorer and defender. So it's absolutely a major reason why he's the better player. I agree with you on that."
At least then he'll have an excuse for not dunking on Trae Young.
"Ok fair enough.  Looks like he managed to squeeze in the year Steph and Kyrie were injured most of the season.  Even that year I think Booker and Trae Young were better, but it's easy to say that in hindsight.  Simmons is an all world defender and the right team could cover up his offensive woes to some extent."
"&gt;Infinitely better defender  He's still a shitty defender and who gives a fuck about PG defense anyways lol one of the most overrated ""weakenesses"" on this sub.

Trae Young be like Dikembe Mutombo in that paint bruv
"and, of course, not passing up open layups below the basket next to Trae Young. oh, and actually showing up to camp, training sessions &amp; games."
ESPN: Magic says Trae Young is “stupid” when he does his thing.
I hate sandwiches that can't finish in the lane over Trae Young.
&gt;Trae Young good  \-Magic Johnson
&gt;Milwaukee/Atlanta versus Boston (Giannis/Trae young versus Tatum)  How can they play in the finals?
Ben Simmons. He already acts like he has more estrogen than testosterone. Maybe the smaller ball will get his confidence to shoot more. But there are women as big or taller than Trae Young so idk
"Joel Embiid. Please allow me to explain. I don't mean people should be scrutinising him for his character but I feel like hes been let off the hook for his playoff failures.  So, to me, Joel Embiid has underachieved in 3 of the last 4 playoffs hes played in starting from 2018. Rewind your memory and youll remember its the 2nd round with the Boston celtics vs the 76ers. The 76ers were undoubtedly the favourites in that series, it was Embiid, Simmons, Saric, Reddick, Ilyasova, Bellinelli going up against rookie Tatum, Sophomore Brown, Rozier,Smart and Horford. Not only did they lose, they lost in 5 games. Im willing to half let this slide since it was his first playoff appearance.  2019 was his worst by far. The 76ers had by far one of the most stacked rosters in the league with Embiid, Butler, Simmons, Harris and Reddick i mean cmon. They were definetely supposed to beat Toronto. After averaging 27.5 ppg and 14 rpg on 48% fg in the regular season his stats plummetted to a meagrr 17.5ppg and 9 rpg on 37% fg. Simply indefensible  2021. Now one of the main reasons why Embiid was left off the hook in this playoffs was because Simmons' ineptitude sorta overshadowed it all. But i need to reiterate how bad of a team they lost to for those who forgot. They were facing a 5th seeded, LITERAL playoff virgin team as the 1 seed. Trae young, collins, huerter, bogdanovic, gallinari i mean are you kidding me you lost to this team. If anyone dare says they expected the hawks to beat them they are fucked up. You have Harris, Simmon, Curry, Green, Thybulle, Howard and you cant beat this 5th seeded ppayoff virgin 22 yr olds. Its ridiculous. They blew a 18 pt 4th quarter in game 5 where embiid went 1-5 and in the 4th quarter of game 7 he didnt score in the last 4 minutes when it was tied and couldnt get it done. Ik every 6er fan is dissappointed in him."
Trae Young. The team is literally built around lobs being an easy way to save a play. It's a great time to buy into the team
"Trae young in shambles, more at eleven!"
"i believe the org/coach is giving him the Trae Young treatment for this preseason. Just do anything and everything to get him reps and comfortable/confident. Before him coming back in the playoffs and this game, I've never really seen him happy like he was. I think firing LP is gonna do WONDERS for Cam."
Trae Young defending Giannis lol
But can he score 10 points against elite rim protectors like Trae Young?!
Sharife Cooper is also Trae Young
Embiid wasn't 100 percent that series and the Hawks are one of the few teams in the league that punishes drop back schemes because Trae Young is the best pick and roll operator in the league.
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"I mean not even as a slight to them, we just make the playoffs and Knicks fans are relentless in their shit talk before the series, then its Fuck Trae young, hella flagrant fouls by Knicks players, etc.  Everything Trae did was in retaliation. He wasn’t the villain in this story but the media ate it up"
Trae Young
The same Ja that KILLED Golden State in the play-in game and sent the Golden boy Curry home? The same Trae Young that took over the Garden? Can't be. Can't fucking be.
Trae Young &gt; Kyrie
"No.  Ja passes the ""would he dunk on Trae Young"" test, Simmons does not."
I'm confused. I don't know how to react to one of these lists where Trae Young isn't being disrespected.   Uhhhh....uhh......fuck the Celtics?
"This Lamelo hype seems over the top. I admit I didn't get to see enough of him, but I think when a guy is Lebron or KD tier, he impresses you first or second game you see him. I think Luka, Zion, and even Tatum showed that.  I like Ball, but I've seen games from him including that play-in game and he didn't look like this transcendent talent like these fans keep pushing. I think he will be really great still like multiple time all-star, but media/fans want a Ball brother to be some anointed star so bad.  Also Trae had a great postseason that few young guys could do and JA is arguably a better version of Lamelo if you ask me. I don't think Lamelo will ever be a really elite offensive player though he looks competent to be one."
"On what basis would you take LaMelo over Trae Young? That LaMelo won Rookie of the Year?      Well soooooorrrrryyyy that Trae didn't win it over fucking Luka, lol."
Trae Young is not overrated at all. He didn’t make the All-Star team in either of the last two seasons. That’s a travesty.
I'm a happy 'Trae Young is very overrated guy' but lamelo over him and Ja is a bit too far for me.
Trae Young above cp3????? Am I missing something
Already working on a time machine to dunk on Trae Young
Except offence tends to be more important than defence (obviously if you are straight up awful at defence jyt can help but look at trae young dude is absolutely fucking awful at defence truly truly awful and his impact on offence is enough to counteract that.  Jokic might only score say 26 a game but that isn't all the points he was responsible for his playmaking allows his team to score more points and his 3 point shooting let's him spread the floor also meaning more points.  Ad is responsible for less points in a game and also plays far fewer games due to having a really bad playstyle for someone with his frame (as in his playstyle leads to injury not saying he is a bad player)  So we are basically comparing offence vs defence and offence wins that.  (mind you ad is still a great player I would put him top 15 without hesitation its just jokic has a bigger impact on the floor by basically being the source of majority of the offence on his team vs ad who is not quite as talented at creating offence
"What you guys fail to understand is every center gets targeted in the PnR. If Jokic was easy pickings by Cp3, so was Gobert by Terrance Mann or Embiid by Trae young."
AI was going up for layups against guys like Shaq who made no secret of his tendency to try and lay out guards who challenged him at the rim as intimidation  Ben Simmons gave up a dunk because he got spooked by 6'1 Trae Young standing vaguely in his vicinity  The mentality difference between AI &amp; Ben is shocking
it’s overrated &amp; underrated at the same like a random January game on a Tuesday he’ll look like Trae young on defense
I would like to remind everyone that Trae Young can *technically* dunk
Mom can we have Trae Young?  We have Trae Young at home.   Trae Young at home:
Mom can we have Trae Young?  We have Trae Young at home.   Trae Young at home:
"First you wouldn't dunk on 6 foot 1 Trae Young, now you wouldn't dunk on an average sized woman either?  We know that's you Ben  /s"
"I mean I think that comes down to not knowing about the players. Huerter this season was 12 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds on 43% FG/36% 3P/ 78% FT.   RJ Barrett was 18 points, 3 assists, 6 rebounds on 44% FG/ 40% 3P/ 75% FT.   RJ did this with Elfrid Payton his starting point guard not passing him the ball, while Huerter played with Trae Young."
How can you talk about tanking success and not include the team with the best young core in the league. Hawks made the playoffs annually realized they weren’t gonna win completely started over now landed Trae rest is history
"Vuc’s defence is like Jokic but without jokic’s few strengths. He’s bad in the pick and roll cause he’s laterally slow and can’t guard shooters or ball handlers when he’s switched on to them. He doesn’t deter shots at the rim. He’s not athletic. Generally Orlando has had exceptional defensive personnel that have helped hide him. It doesn’t mean much in respect to him. Other examples include Pau Gasol with the spurs, valancunis with the Grizzlies or, well, Sabonis on some of the past pacers teams.   And the bulls defence also improved because Zach Lavine played in like half of the games vuc did due to injury, and ofc its a very small sample overall.  He’s not like the Trae young of C’s but he’s in the bottom 5 of starting C defenders"
"No one on that team is close to the level of player as booker, CP3, or Trae young. Both teams were better overall as well."
The sub is a circlejerk and anything anti-Ben Simmons will be eaten up by the same groups of people looking to farm karma off their “Ben Simmons wouldn’t even dunk on trae young lolol” take. Even a 7 month old clip of fucking josh Jackson calling Simmons a bitch got upvoted to the front page: if that doesn’t tell you this entire sub is a circlejerk idk what will
Trae Young is an Elite rim protector. Idk what you’re talking about.
"I wonder what the organization told him his role would be. After game 7, he said in his interview something like “Trae Young shot 5/23, I handed out 12-13 assists, I did my job”. If the entire year he’s been told to focus on defence and playmaking, then I put it on the organization. If they wanted him to be more of a scorer and he refused, I put it on Ben"
I'm pretty sure he was concerned about Trae Young fouling him hard enough to prevent the dunk and turning the possession into two Ben Simmons free throws.
"I mean, can you really blame them? The man passed on an open layup with mighty tall Trae Young next to the basket. In a playoff game. A do-or-die game 7, at that. Pretty much every fanbase would be fuming."
Trae Young ended the process.
Trae Young.
"Sure, but average annual value is a disengenuous way to represent a 5 year deal in a league that constantly adjusts it's salary cap.   He's not in the same tier as Luka, Trae Young, and Michael Porter Jr? He brought his team to the finals. Those guys all got the type of money he's looking for without the runaround from their orgs. Many teams would be happy to give Ayton what he wants, it's a bad call on the Suns part especially after Ayton watched CP3 get paid."
How much do you fear Trae Young as a shot blocker?
"But I mean Simmons is not anchoring or single handedly carrying a defense. He can slow down the #1 player on the other team but that’s it. He’s not gonna stop Giannis or Embiid and Trae Young or Kyrie will still be effective. He isn’t gonna be anywhere close to replacing Irving’s shooting, scoring or playmaking on offense. The trade makes them way worse."
"Definitely not 40% but he shot better from 25-29 than he did from 20-24 (deep 2s) through March 2021.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/blazers/2021/03/18/damian-lillard-channeling-his-inner-steph-curry-long-range-shooting/4744779001/  He was 40% from 25-29, 33% from 30-34, and 35% from 20-24  Ending the year (20-21) he was 34.6% on 30+ making 45/130  https://www.blazersedge.com/2021/5/26/22455148/damian-lillard-trail-blazers-three-point-range-30-footers-steph-curry-trae-young"
"I see. Thanks for the explanation, I'm still confused though, because the point is, they still would've never had 120 permanently because Trae Young has to come off sometimes. So while it's wishful thinking they'd be rated above the Nets, I'm sure there's a lot of other circumstances where if you cut out the bad players or only measure based on the best you would also have similar results. I don't think this metric is very important due to the fact that offensive rating is the whole team too though, because Trae Young can't really play every minute on the floor"
"When Trae young was on the court the Hawks had a 120 offensive rating, the Nets had a 117 rating. They didn’t finish number one because their offense was so bad when Trae was off the court. Meanwhile the nets are alternating between KD, Harden and Irving so their offense is stupid at all times."
"Wait, Trae Young is a good player?"
"C'mon Trae young is a pretty intimidating dude. Not just anyone could dunk over him. Dudes gotta be like what 6'2""? Giannis is probably the only player in the league that could manage that."
"20% is too extreme. I doubt anyone will see that much of a decrease (except maybe Trae Young lol). I'll do $100 for a 15% reduction from last season. Last year was 7.3, so the line would be 6.2. Last time he averaged under 7 was in OKC as a 6th man, so I think the bet is still pretty fair.   If you know of a trustworthy escrow, I'm fine with it. I've also done [similar bets](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1qfunr/kevin_loves_postgame_locker_room_interview_that/cdcln38/?context=3) in the past if you're willing to take my word for it. (I deleted that account b/c it got doxxed.)"
"Something has changed. Now, we've seen him in the dunkers spot, passing up dunks over Trae Young."
Simmons would dodge that stand harder than a closing out Trae Young on a wide open dunk.
How does this entire thread not have a single mention of Trae Young? Man looks like he asked for four different hairstyles and the barber said got you.
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
"I have a very hot take about Ben Simmons. The take is, Ben Simmons being is valued incorrectly and is being unfairly compared by the media. The media wants Ben Simmons to be more like Curry, Trae Young, and Lillard because those are the type of players leading the PG position. They want him to develop a jumper to space the floor etc. Who i think the media should be comparing Simmons to is a player like Rudy Gobert instead because their roles are more alike and their numbers are kind of similar as well. Obviously Simmons has glaring weaknesses in his game like the free throw shooting that should absolutely be developed but his strengths should be enough to make up of the jump shooting."
Luka and Trae deserved the deals they got but I wonder how much Michael Porter Jr’s contract is gonna screw up other teams with young players who are extremely valued but not max worthy as of rn. Max players should only be all-star level players or borderline all-star and I don’t know if Ayton will be that yet
Luka vs. Trae Young hair vs. hair match
"Holy fucking shit there is so much wrong with this comment. First of all I wanted to trade Ben years ago, so I'm definitely not salty that he wants to leave. I'm actually happy I don't have to watch him stand in the dunker spot doing nothing ever again.   &gt; Trae Young, who was the best player on the court   Arguable.   Trae: 30 pts, 3 reb, 11 assists, 2 stls  Embiid: 30 pts, 13 reb, 4 asst, 2 blocks, 1 steal while being a defensive anchor and shooting higher fg% and 3pt% that series than Trae  &gt;the team tried to change Fultz’s shot  they didnt   &gt;Jahlil got injured    he didnt nor is it the reason that didnt work   &gt;Y’all made excuses about Ben’s mentality when your entire team underperformed, and those petty excuses came with a heavy cost.  I personally hated his mentality from day 1 and i agree it has cost us and thats the only thing i agree with you on. Your entire comment is pretty much made up and explains why no one has agreeing with you. Your insistence on a stranger being ""salty"" and how much of your comment was flat out false leads me to believe that youre a teenager who doesnt actually watch or know what they are talking about"
"Like I said, he's better today and that gap only increases if you take potential into account. Your whole thing is about playoffs, maintaining his numbers... But he had a great offensive playoff run too, again better than Ayton's. His defence is poor, but A) given he started playing regular NBA minutes a year ago and has already improved is certainly not that concerning and B) is simply a less important factor than his offensive ability. Everyone loves to zoom into individual defence as if it's this 50/50 thing with offence but it really really isn't. An offensive skillset is just much more important to have, and really defence is much more about coaching and system than about any one player. Trae Young didn't magically improve from being a historical terrible defender, it just wasn't especially important given how Atlanta set up ."
Yes because everyone else did such a great job stopping Giannis. sorry a 22 year old in his first playoff run didn’t stop arguably the best player in the world going super nova. It’s like seeing curry destroy trae young in a playoff series and claiming nah Trae isn’t that good and doesn’t deserve a max…
"&gt;Salty about what?  Your contract-locked golden-child franchise cornerstone is leaving you and you’re in denial. You won’t get equal value back. The Sixers had four top-3 picks from 2014-2017 and only one is going play for you this year. You could have had Embiid, Booker, Simmons and Tatum. You now have only Embiid. Sixers have no accolades to show for 5 years of tanking, and will again be mediocre for the foreseeable future.   Mainly you’re salty because Sixers got their cheeks clapped by Trae Young, who was the best player on the court vs. your ‘DPOY’ and ‘MVP’ candidates. Y’all made excuses about Ben’s mentality when your entire team underperformed, and those petty excuses came with a heavy cost.   This is one of the worst turn of events in American sports history. It’s not Ben’s fault that the team tried to change Fultz’s shot or that Jahlil got injured. It’s not his fault The Process failed, but they needed a scapegoat and sacrificed a max-contract player. It’s complete franchise self-implosion but you still trust the front office. You agree that it’s all Ben’s fault, and yet you still want him to lead you to a bright sunny future.   It’s completely nonsensical &amp; hilarious from the outside, and yes you sound very salty about it."
They should Trae Young  Have no clue about his acting but he seems like a guy that can adjust to those type of environment.
What will Harden do? Or Trae Young?
Lol yea I’m sure Matt and Jack have it out for Trae Young
Yeah of course Raptor announcers making him sound like greatest passer on earth and not mentioning the 8 TO's at all. If that was Trae Young that would be the FIRST thing they mention...
This seasons Trae Young looks like an evil twin
"You can't go backwards, but you can go straight up and stop your momentum quicker than the defender can. Which is what happened on that particular play Nash complained about. There's even an example of Trae Young making an identical play in the NBA's instructional video on what's *not* a foul."
Is it just me or does this seasons Trae young look like an evil twin?
"Trae Young is killing it tonight, so as Djimon Hounsou said in Gladiator, not yet.   Not yet."
Trae Young floaterfest suddenly.
Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young
Those Trae young flashbacks be giving him depression
By the end of the season the majority of Reddit will say Ja Morant.    I have always said I’d rather have Ja Morant long term over Trae Young and I think that starts this season.    Ja is better
They don't want him to play there. They need him to. His value is at its lowest point and not showing up doesn't help. If Simmons wants out he's going to have to show up and actually play to show teams he's worth trading for. Sixers can't snap their fingers like Thanos and make everyone forget that Ben literally got scared of Trae fucking Young.
trae young
"""That's not basketball"" - Steve Nash on Trae Young foul calls prior to the Harden trade."
"Yeah, but dame only won 1 first round series in his career if I am not mistaken.  So nevermind what luka does, he needs to win a playoff seires to be a superstar?  &gt;Like shit, Trae Young has a better argument at being a superstar than Luka right now  Ok lol  I don't know, but if you ask me, Luka is better than trae. And I would pick him over dame.  But thats just me, maybe I am biased."
"I guess it comes down to a philosophical question, what makes a superstar, a superstar?   For me, Luka has yet to win a playoff series. He’s a very very good up &amp; coming player but he’s not in the upper echelon of the NBA yet til he proves that he should be considered that. Like shit, Trae Young has a better argument at being a superstar than Luka right now  But if you base a “superstar” on the hype they generate &amp; the amount of people that gather to watch just that player play, then maybe. Idk I’m just a dumbass at the end of the day"
Outside of one bad call they’ve been letting Trae Young get dogged in the paint. Westbrook has gotten minimal paint calls as well.
Have all the clowns saying this dude isn't in the conversation with Trae Young gone into hiding yet? Where yall at?
"It greatly irritates me that Nash is now complaining that Harden isn't getting calls for moves he called ""not basketball"" when Trae Young did them against the Nets.  I get advocating for your players but I cant stand the hypocrisy. Especially in this instance when he used these moves to tear down trae who has always said how much of an inspiration Nash is to him."
Luka’s not a superstar yet. Trae Young is more of a superstar than he is at this point
"What 2 players could you legitimately say this about and be reasonably correct?  Trae Young is the Steve Nash of basketball, maybe?"
"Speaking of which, how's Trae Young adjusting to the new rules?"
"Lmao just stop.  &gt; all that matters is points per game  AD edges out Wilkens in a hell of a lot more than PPG  &gt; media awards, right? Not that he was a 9 time all star  You mention media awards as irrelevant then bring up All-Star selections ? Also AD has 8 of those and is a lock for a 9th this year so that's not an advantage to Wilkens.  &gt; who went on to become one of the greatest NBA coaches ever?  Completely irrelevant. The top-75 list is about player careers, nothing else. You don't see Pat Riley or Phil Jackson on the list.  &gt; Put Gilbert Arenas on there, he scored points  You're comparing Arenas to AD as a player ? Literally everything I've heard from Pelicans fans over the last 3 years makes it clear you absolutely did not deserve AD and it's no wonder he asked out. You had no appreciation for the kind of player you had.  &gt; Trae Young had like 30ppg, he's already better than Robert Horry, right?  Is this a joke ? I love Robert Horry and think he's underrated, but yes, Trae Young is a MUCH better player than Robert Horry ever was, are you on crack ?"
"Cause all that matters is points per game and media awards, right? Not that he was a 9 time all star who went on to become one of the greatest NBA coaches ever? Let's take all these guys off the list, then. Put Gilbert Arenas on there, he scored points. Trae Young had like 30ppg, he's already greater than Robert Horry, right?"
"I told my buddy (LAL fan) that our teams (GSW fan here) were in possible trap games, and it was close for both of us.   Fox (SAC) and Ja are elevating in skill so much. I think a shift in talent is starting to roll, and in two years time, there is gonna be a significant change. Giannis is still young and killing it, and peeps like Ja, Fox, Booker, Trae, Ayton, etc. are developing so well and so fast. Sports media has been slow to really give them their due, but the time is coming. I just hope a lot of the talent remains in small markets. As much as I want GSW to win another chip, it would be cool to see some of these small market teams win it."
I thought he was going to be a MASSIVE project but had an outside of shot of being a Trae Young type of player. I had no idea he would be this good this fast. Literally even in his first preseason game it was like 'holy shit. this guy has it'
Dude was my favorite high school player since Trae Young
A guy in my Fantasy drafted Kawhi and Kyrie on the same team then tried to send a trade to me for Jimmy Butler and Trae Young.
Is trae young now valid?
"Oh I didn’t see that was a 5’9 Nba player yeah I’m pretty confident a guy like Isiah Thomas isn’t boxing like that. There are for sure some guys that can fight especially in rough neighborhoods but I don’t think Caruso, Trae Young, Steph are really fighting"
FUCK TRAE YOUNG. FUCK TRAE YOUNG
"The refs are calling less this year for basically every player though. It looks worse for Harden because he foul baited a lot of the time. Besides, Steve Nash criticized Trae Young for foul baiting, and now he expects sympathy for someone that consistently wrapped player's arms and kicked his legs out on jumpers."
Does Bullock do a better job on Trae Young than DFS did?
"Curry will do those Harden/Trae Young foul stuffs once in a blue moon, but his game is not base on that. But Curry absolutely deserve to shoot as many FT as Harden consider how much defense grab and hold onto him when he is off ball but the refs always ignore that."
"Trae Young, Joel Embiid, and Jimmy Butler are almost there too"
Yeah this is what Coward Nash gets for going after Trae Young
"Why do people keep saying ""refuses to shoot"" like he can just decide to do it?  He sucks at it.  He could do it, but he'd be terribly inefficient and hurt the team.  For all we know he might be working his ass off to get better at it, and still suck.  Do you say Trae Young ""refuses to defend"" or ""refuses to rebound""?  Did Shaq refuse to score free throws?  This whole weird internet/fan meme about his shooting among Philly fans is what has lead us to this point.  He's not secretly hiding some ability.  He's just bad at it.  Life isn't an RPG.  You can't just grind some experience points and level it up.  Secretly fans invested in a player prefer to think that a player just ""isn't trying"" because then they hold out hope that it is fixable.  And that's better than accepting that he just doesn't have the talent.  It's pretty unlikely that a guy who has worked hard enough behind the scenes to get his defense to all-NBA level just isn't bothering to train his offensive game."
"A large part of these rule changes involve jumping into airborne defenders.  That's really never been Harden's MO.  I think that's what he's talking about.  The armhooking, initiating contact, and stuff like that is all right up Harden's alley but he's never really been the guy to pump fake and jump into an airborn defender.  That's a Jimmy Butler/Trae Young type thing, not a Harden thing."
Guy threw a fit when Trae Young was drawing fouls saying it “wasn’t basketball” and is now crying after a rule change because his own player isn’t skilled enough to draw fouls without cheating?
TRAE YOUNG LOOKS LIKE MY DADS DICK!!
Those guys were never empty stat players and only morons think they were. Trae Young is the most egregious case of a player who got slandered with the “empty stats” shit. The 2019-20 Hawks were so lucky better with him on the court (even with his abysmal defence) it wasn’t even funny.
"Don't know why this is controversial lol. Lillard ranked just ahead of Trae Young in terms of POA defense (so literally one of the worst defenders in the league) per BBALL INDEX last season. Meanwhile, Curry's been an average or slightly below average POA defender while being a much superior rotational defender as well (classified as helper per BBALL INDEX last season)"
"The worst is easily the Trae Young bust one. I will never understand how you see a guy averaging 30 and 10 in college and say “it won’t translate, too small” despite being the average height for his position."
"Trae Young is as good as Luka Doncic or that it's a ""legit convo"""
Getting to the ECF wasn't a fluke.   The second best player in the East might be Trae Young.
I want to win championship i take Trae Young
"Jokic, Tatum, Luka then Trae. Love my guy but cmon y’all Luka and Trae are top tier young guys but Tatum gets so underrated i seem him placed below Luka all the time like my man ain’t been balling for a minute now"

"People would think you're crazy to trade Zion for someone else to put next to BI, because the idea of Zion is crazy. He's an insanely talented scorer when healthy... hof-level if his career lasts...  But sometimes I think about it. We're 2 out of 3 seasons with an injured Z not showing up, and then not showing up in shape either after breaks... he's 'young and immature' is the excuse I hear, but Ja and Trae and other young guys come ready to play... and they actually seem to like their team/city and like to show out for them.  The idea of Zion is way too crazy to ever pass up though.  Just makes me sad because I don't really want BI over here on his own all the time! And you don't want to lose him because you're waiting on Z to get healthy all the time. 😞"
You must have not seen Trae Young play this season. The refs continue gifting him that foul or not calling it offensive foul like they should. It’s disgusting and my dislike for Trae grows each game
Man trae young really made you guys the saltiest bunch huh
"There are different players in every draft class, you cannot make that comparison. The Hawks believed Trae Young could be a franchise player, I highly doubt the Cavs held the same sentiment with Giddey."
"Duarte has a solid 90 mph fastball with great movement, and is a top 5 Cy Young candidate. Tyler Herro is batting .302 with 31 homers and 40 stolen bases. Trae and Luka are utility guys getting minor league contracts, with a few call ups a year: and you don't think this is some joke?!"
"Maybe.  It'd be a shame though. I think Thunder fans are basically hoping that SGA is our Mitchell, Giddey is our Ingles, and we draft our Gobert this year or next year.  I'm a Giddey believer and if he ends up being the guy we end up building around (there's worse things to build around than a 6'9"" playmaker who was a triple-double machine at 18 in a professional league), then I'm all for it.  But it's too soon to give up on SGA being the building block, I hope. The fan nickname for SGA is ""the Timeline,"" in that our timeline *is* SGA rather than SGA not fitting into our ""timeline."" That being said, it didn't look like that in our first two games. It looked like a bunch of rookies and a frustrated young star who's been watching Ayton, Luka, and Trae take the league by storm while he's getting blown out by the Rockets."
"I remember watching Trae do this a couple times against the sixers in the playoffs last year and the defenders avoided the contact, Trae didn't get the call and instead threw up awkward looking attempts when he could've shot normally and probably got buckets. Sure it was only 2 possessions but I enjoyed seeing him throw up those ugly little shits for no reward    Speaking of ugly little shits; Trae Young.  /sodium purge"
Trae Young had similar statline tonight. It’s called an off-game. Happens to everyone in the league.
"Your definition of achievement is skewed, none of the three you mentioned accomplished more than what he has... Luka hasn't made it past the first round, Trae reached the conference finals for the first time in his life, and Mitchell haven't gotten past the second round. Given his all-star appearance and the fact that he's consistently made it to the playoffs, there's really no argument that he's achieved more than the three you listed.  Mind you Lebron was 26 when he won his first ring, and KD was 27. Stop putting ridiculous expectations on young players because they aren't averaging 40ppg coming out of the gate, and give them time."
"I'm missing a few things more than that surely. I didnt talk about trae young being better than luka, trae owning MSG, randle shooting 31% in the playoffs after making an All NBA team, embiid flops or fuck ben Simmons etc."
Trae young. Look up his stats towards his first few months in the nba
Trae Young literally did this tonight and got the call. We’ll see how long the “rule” is enforced
"Ricky padreando a Trae Young,justo lo que todos esperábamos esta temporada.  FIBA Rubio is a different beast"
"I know right. The NBA came out with a rule about jumping into players while jump shooting, and somehow it doesn’t apply to trae young"
ayo fuck trae young
RUBIO IS A GOD   FUCK TRAE YOUNG
"Because our FO was and is a garbage fire. The Hawks without Trae would be an exciting talented young team, the Mavs without Luka are a full on hard tank lottery team."
"How many years are we going to talk about ceiling until he actually produces it though?  Even before covid, he wasn’t consistent. The big narrative was that he was young.   Meanwhile, Luka, Trae, and Mitchell have been achieving more."
He's not. Harden's trick is to cock his head back as he goes to the rim. The swing through to draw contact was a KD move. Jumping into the defender is more Trae Young.
I’m 99.9% sure it was a win win trade. Why do we have to make one side out to be winners? Luka is an obvious generational talent and Trae isn’t far behind + reddish who’s a nice young piece. Hawks rebuild going smoother though.
100% agree. The Hawks GM clearly had a vision on how to surround a heliocentric player like Trae and executed it perfectly. They are also in a great spot for flexibility and have salary and young players to trade for a future star if one becomes available or can keep developing the talent they have and trade their vets as they get older or come contract extension time for more of their younger players. I think they might have the brightest future of any current team.
He'd have to be a bona fide #2 option. At least something like McCollum or Beal.    Yes Luka is a generational talent but Trae Young is a multiple all-star franchise cornerstone. For the Hawks to be considered straight up winners they would have to be further along the championship team process and that would be if Reddish became the #2 option.
"If Luka wins an MVP on the Mavs, then Trae Young would have to as well before you even factor in Cam.  Otherwise, the team with the MVP won the trade."
It does not feel like the Cavs have the personnel to guard Trae Young.
"Okay, let's take a step back because you're defending against arguments I am not making.  I didn't mention his playmaking because I didn't need to - my argument is there are aspects of Trae's game that are ignored, and playmaking isn't one of them because it's obvious it's incredible. For me there's only one player I'd comfortably take over him on that and it's Jokic,.  I never suggested that the Hawks beat the Sixers 'in spite of' Trae, obviously he is an essential part of their offense. I'm only saying that his scoring/efficiency was sub-par in that series which is not unfair.  I don't think it's unfair at all to criticise Trae's shot selection, which can sometimes go overlooked. I also think it's reasonable to say his problems on defense weren't really challenged during the playoffs since every team he played against had someone who was zero offensive threat.  If someone says 'I think Trae Young is much closer to Luka than people say', and someone answers with 'I agree, here are some things that are overlooked about Luka' it's part of the discussion for someone to bring up things about Trae that might not be considered - *especially* coming off a playoff performance that has been lionised (which isn't a phenomenon unique to Trae).  I'm not out to get Trae. Responding with some mild criticism of him to a chain about how Trae is closer to Luka than people think, followed by things Luka has problems with isn't hating it's just preventing the discussion from being a bland circlejerk."
"Yep he got a bit of a raw deal having to play over there right now. Like I get that he got a huge bag for the trouble which is nice, but for a guy who is a similar caliber of prospect to Ja Morant, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, etc. as a creator, it has to suck that those guys are on fun teams while he toils on the Thunder."
"The other day against the Mavs, Trae Young jumped backwards into Tim Hardaway Jr and Tim's chin started bleeding hard he had to get 3 stitches at the break.   Trae got the call and shot free throws smfh"
"At a minimum, players have a strong financial incentive to bait fouls when the rules allow it, and not just because winning games gets them better offers. Is someone like Trae Young supposed to prisoner's dilemma himself playing gentlemen's-agreement-ball, when he's chasing an All-NBA selection and salary cap bump? Players even get direct [contract incentives](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27162275/inside-contracts-led-kd-kyrie-deals) that pay them just for getting to the line.  If a player does want to say ""foul baiting is bullshit, I'm just not gonna do it,"" then that's great and should be applauded by fans everywhere. And we don't applaud people just for doing their job, which means policing yourself to compensate for broken systems definitely isn't part of theirs.  There's no villain here, really. The league set the rules, the players acted according to the incentives those rules created, the fans complained that those incentives were bullshit, and the league (eventually) updated the rules. If that's not a happy ending I dunno what is."
Trae Young is actually more skilled.   Y’all gonna see within next few years. Jimmy has the experience and rep but Trae is gonna prove himself soon.
"My favorite players are Trae Young and James Harden, I still think this is the best rule change we've seen in a long time. Very good for viewers, and for the health and spirit of the game. A+ shit."
Trae Young is very underrated by this sub and is much closer to Luka than people here think
"I mean Ben did his job of stopping Trae Young go off. Trae hit a big 3 in the 4th quarter close game but he went like 5-23 all night thanks to Ben.   Meanwhile, Doc never made adjustment to stop Huerter.   Ben was passive offensively. And that's a fuck-up. But putting all the blame on one play is a tad unfair. Thybulle went 1-2 in his free throws off the Ben pass and later fouled a three-point shooter. Embiid had turnovers in the clutch.   You want Simmons to get better but playing Sixers vs. Ben isn't the way to go. Imagine Draymond and Kerr blaming Steph in 2016 G7 for that behind the back pass to out of bounds for Klay."
I just hope this proves the differnce between scrappy players who get to the line a lot on legit fouls and the guys who leaned on foul baiting. Jimmy Butler is not the same kind of player as a Trae Young.
"trae young could break it   he just turned 23  stockton wasn’t even a full time starter until he was 25  trae is at 1821 assists, stockton 15,806. difference is 13,985  for the next 15 years, Trae would need to average 11.2 assists per game. a tall task, but Atlanta is seemingly building a powerhouse down there.   i do believe the NBA will take back the age requirement and there will be a kid who plays from like 18-40 due to modern medicine and he will break it"
Knicks fans chanting fuck trae young after beating the Celtics is all you need to know
"Do lineups which consist entirely of young players ever work out? All the trashing seems to affect them and after some time they end up developing loser mentality. The whole ""let's just mess around for years and not even try to win"" setup doesn't help either. Even the older guys that they have are not there to play, they are just stockpiled and waiting for the next trade.  It maybe sound like a cliche but you need someone who ""knows what it takes to win"". Like Philly tried with Butler and Horford.  I also wouldn't compare them to Atlanta because they have guys like Capela, Bogdanovic and Lou who are there to try to win, and Trae is fucking fearless."
Fucking Doris Burke. I remember when she was sucking off Trae Young during the Knicks vs Hawks series last year
Young players take time to develop. Look at the hawks. First year w trae..awful. 2nd year w Trae…awful. It took till year 3 and a coaching change to be good. Most of OKC is super young going against grown men
Trae Young will beat that. easy.
FUCK TRAE YOUNG
Fuck the knicks. You’re dad trae young says go to bed or he’ll spank you.  Also fuck the timberwolves
"Yes he did lol   I watched the video right after I posted that comment just to make sure and it said it word for word   “I FEEL LIKE I’M IN THE SAME CONVERSATION AS THOSE GUYS, THE YOUNG GUYS COMING UP IN THE LEAGUE WHO CAN BE ALL-STARS, SUPERSTARS ONE DAY. LUKA [DONCIC], TRAE [YOUNG], JA [MORANT], THOSE GUYS LIKE THAT. I FEEL LIKE MY NAME SHOULD BE IN THAT CATEGORY, TOO””"
TRAE YOUNG LOOK LIKE MY DADS DICK!
Devin Booker. Trae Young
IS TRAE YOUNG VALID???
Trae young. Come on
"Trae Young has already arrived at the superstar tier.  Zion looks on pace to be great, if his body cooperates.  LaMelo still needs some more polishing."
Trae Young
He’s as valid as trae young
FUCK TRAE YOUNG
Trae young because he isn't scared of big games.
Trae Young era Hawks.
"Just a dumb take. There weren't super teams all around the NBA when LBJ could take the Cavs to the finals every year in a weak East which is about the same time Dwight had his success with the Magic.    Name a team in the East that would be as strong as the Clippers last year with that amount of superstar talent + quality depth.    Instead of a dumb shallow take, understand the difference between Trae with the Hawks &amp; Luka with the Mavs. It's roster building and the opportunities given by losing consistently before &amp; even with Trae. Bunch of high draft picks leads to Hunter, Reddish, Collins, etc and smart roster additions like Capella.    With Luka, the Mavs don't lose enough to get those picks and obviously lost the ability to collect more young assets with high ceilings by trading away picks for KP &amp; the pick for Luka. So while the Hawks roster is only getting better by the development of young, highly talented guys, the Mavs' most promising young talent that looks to continue to grow is ... Jalen Brunson, a 2nd rounder back up guard."
"In this modern era, your franchise's developmental program is nowhere near top 3. You sign a lot of guys that are already established and do away with your young talent. A lot of other franchises have that player that they can say they developed into something big. The Jazz has Donovan Mitchell. The Hawks have Trae Young. The Celtics have Jayson Tatum. The Heat have Bam Adebayo. The Pelicans had Anthony Davis and has Zion. The only guy I can see potentially fit that bill for y'all is THT, but only if you keep him."
"Just a young kid having fun out there. I’m not sure there’s an active player in the league who has done more with less; He’s not tall, he’s not big, he’s not athletic, he can’t jump, he doesn’t have an insane wingspan. But he clearly has put in the time and dedication needed to master the craft of handling a basketball.  Watching Trae break ankles and put his massive balls behind his back and between other players’s legs… truly a joy to watch."
Trae was a marketing move. I’m not saying the city would’ve not embraced Luka as they did trae but Young definitely has the bigger personality
"There is no time line with Luka. Same with Trae and Donavan Mitchell honestly, hell Trae literally just went to the conference finals.  I get that normally young players don’t have success in the NBA, but what is there really to wait for with any of those guys?"
"Saying Trae was the first to lead in scoring and assists is a lot of cherry-picking and fairly meaningless. Lots of other players were very close to leading in both, or simply did not have the needed play-style or were not on a team that would allow them to do that. By pure volume on counting stats he was excellent. I said his efficiency was not otherworldly but just solid. 36% from 3 and 58 TS% with his turnover rate even on high volume is very solid but not at all eye-popping. And it makes it more concerning how good he will be when he’s so small and lacks athleticism.  And if you want to go by just pure college stats, then his advanced stats in college were again solid but not amazing. A WS/40 of 0.20 is not that great. A PER of 28 is very good but fairly typical of a 5-10 pick or even lower. He wasn’t even top 10 that year in PER.  And again his size and lack of athleticism were huge concerns. He was smaller, shorter and less athletic than all of the guys you just mentioned. Russel is 6’4” and 195lbs with awesome athleticism. How does he compare to Young? Fox is 6’3” with much better athleticism and was also the 5th pick. Oladipo is 6’4”, 215lbs and an amazing athlete. John Wall, Westbrook and Rose are all taller and much heavier than Young and were ultra-explosive freak athletes. I don’t understand any of these comparisons. If Trae had the physique of any of these guys with the stats he put up he would have gone 1 or 2. The problem was that he didn’t have that physique so he fell to 5th, which is still very high.  Steph his freshman year would not have even been a first round pick and maybe not drafted at all. Though his efficiency and advanced states were still generally better than Trae. He wasn’t drafted until 2 years later when he was way better. And again it still took him 5 years on top of that to become an All-Star. Drafting Steph that high was still a small gamble. And it took a long time to actually pay off. Just because it then paid off massively doesn’t mean it wasn’t a small risk. And if he was taken something like #1 over Blake Griffin that would have been a gigantic, insane gamble. He ended up being way better than Griffin but that doesn’t mean it would have been a reasonable pick at the time."
"Joel Embiid. I used to think he was a cocky asshole until I watched Trae Young drag his fat fucking nuts across the Knicks faces. Then I was like ""hey this trash talk and taunting thing is actually pretty entertaining""."
Trae young dropping fifty on people’s head now and he got called a bust in summer league sometimes people can’t see the road ahead
I get the Trae young hate buy what did Capela do 😂
Rookie Ben Simmons at the ripe young rookie age of 21 would not have been afraid of getting hacked by Trae Young under the rim in a playoff game.
"1. Fuck Trae young  2. I’m 6’1, Coopers 6’1, Traes 6’1 wouldn’t be a need for me in this hypothetical and I would fall in the depth charts  3. Fuck cunt Capela"
Trae young. These playoffs really made me end up liking him. Dudes an assassin. Real deal
"[Kyle Kuzma ""seconded"" Donovan Mitchell's tweet of Trae Young for ROTY](https://mobile.twitter.com/kylekuzma/status/1109658261349777408). So unless Rookie of the Year is no longer ""the best rookie for that season"", then that still means that there's at least one rookie better than Luka for Kuzma. lol  I only found that particular tweet because Nurkic's reply was posted on the Mavs sub after Blake Griffin has ""thirded"" the tweet already. LOL"
Vs Trae Young. Lmfao
"&gt;	im not a philly fan mate, i think they’re a bum organisation with bum fans.  Looking at your comment history, you seem to be living in Ben Simmons’ butthole. Totally makes sense why that shot hurts so much, I’m sure you cried for poor Ben.          &gt;	the other 2 performances went under the radar, and that’s because only one of them lost             1.	Lowry and Jrue struggled because their shot was off, not because they were afraid to dunk against 6ft Trae Young as a 6’11 world class athlete  2.	Hawks are not a comparable team to Nets and the 2019 Sixers"
MVP: Trae Young(Hawks finish as a top 3 seed)  MIP:Obi Toppin(He only played 11 mpg last year)  6MOY: Jordan Poole(I’m just a fan fr lol plus no klay til Christmas will help boost numbers for a bit)  ROY:Jalen Green( His offensive game looks so polished and he’ll probably have an ultimate green light)  DPOY: AD(Has anchored top defense two years in a row and it’s overdue at this point tbh)
MVP: Trae Young  MIP: Lonzo Ball  6MOY: Carmelo Anthony  ROY: Jalen Green
"&gt; might have a similar...work ethic...to Simmons.  Siakam's work ethic isn't a concern at all. He has actually shown improvement pretty much season by season and even this past season as well. Even with his three point shooting dropping off a cliff (which can be partly explained by a shoulder injury, covid and playing all games on the road basically) he actually improved in many aspects of his game.  If we were to look at just efficiency, even with his drastic 3P% drop off he was about as efficient as a whole versus two seasons ago where he was an All Star and All-NBA. He went from 55.4% to 54.7% True Shooting, 51.2% to 49.3% in EFG% and that is also which his FT% increasing from 79.2% to 82.7% and his 2P% from 49.9% to 50.9%.  One common criticism is Siakam's lack of a bag and being a beyblade, but he actually developed a couple counters to defenders trying to play that spin too hard. He has gone for the half spin with a leaning layup or baby hook vs the full spin as well as occasionally faking the spin to the paint and then spinning back to the baseline either to go to the rim or into a shot. He still needs to work on those counters but he has been getting in game reps with both which is good to see.  He has also shown more comfort getting the ball out his hands when faced with a full or partial double team which has been a major weakness for him since being the 1st option on the team in the wake of Kawhi's departure. He has been quicker passing the ball out which he then will attempt to repost to get the ball back or run a quick action such as a pick n roll or come up for a dribble handoff. He has also been surveying the court more versus just going into his move which has resulted in him seeing double team or players stunting and then decided to either go into his move or pass out before the double arrives. This can be reflected in his per100, 4.7A to 6.0A, 3.3TOV to 3.1, 10.7TOV% to 10.6TOV%.  Then we have his defense where he has been forced into playing more at the 5 due to not having a playable centre until Khem Birch, which Siakam stepped up in that role while still doing all the things that make Siakam the centre of our help and rotate + zone heavy defensive schemes and having an even larger impact on that end. 94th percentile in defensive versatility, 3rd in opponent fg% from 5-9 feet (among qualified players), 5th in the league iso points per possession allowed, 3rd in forced TOVs in iso, 2nd in the league in contested threes, 4th in defensive loose balls recovered and 4th among PFs in total contested shots per game. An elite defensive player who has shown the ability to guard 2 through 4 consistently and 1's and 5's when necessary as well.  When it comes to the three point shooting drop off, he got covid, shoulder injury and played all his games on the road. Siakam for his career has been a player who has played significantly better at home in Toronto than on the road and his three point shooting on the road is actually very similar to his three point shooting in a season where he played zero home games. For his career Siakam is a 32.5% shooter from three but if we look at his home and road splits that changes to 34.4% three point shooter at home and 30.7% three point shooter on the road.   So this whole Siakam might have a similar work ethic to Simmons when Simmons has not had any significant growth to his game but rather has rather been fairly stagnant is just hilarious to me. Siakam was the 27th overall and was deemed a major reach. He was mocked in the 2nd round, with DraftExpress having him at 52nd, 49th, 52nd, 42nd and 43rd overall in their six mock drafts that year. His draft comparisons were Bismack Biyombo, Luc Mbah a Moute and Bo Outlaw (which was Dwane Casey's comparison). He has been constantly lauded as a hard worker by teammates, coaches, our front offfice, training staff and team reporters. He went from being a reach at 27th overall to 2nd option on a championship, 1st option on a team that had the 2nd best record in the NBA, All Star starter and 2nd team All-NBA off of his work ethic which took him from ""athletic big man hustle guy but limited ball skills"" which was his basic scouting report coming into the league to ""athletic wing who attacks primarily on-ball and in transition with elite defence at the wing with versatility"". That would suggest an immense work ethic. This whole Siakam work ethic myth comes just from a time where he was having visa issues while living in a condo in Toronto during our stringent lockdown (unlike some US cities like whichever one Trae Young was running 5v5 in at the same time this was happening)."
Used to hate trae young but watching him tear it up last playoffs converted me. Bro is a dawg.
"The true failure is the76ers Management  Joel Embid is the primary  So they want to run a half court set   OK cool  That minimizes Ben Simmons offense   OK cool  So Ben Simmons picked up Tre Young 3/4 court (Trae young shot 5/23)  Made the game slow (philly wins that game)  Made the Hawks best player shoot horribly  And slowed the game down  Literally was the best defensive player  Whats the argument?  He didnt shoot in the 4th?? You fool, the game plan is not to go to Simmons in the 4th  What did he do wrong??"
Obviously the Sixers way underperformed but I was glad that it wasn’t to an absolutely shit team. Trae Young and the Hawks are definitely legit and won me over as well. Can’t help but respect them

“#OnlyAFewUnderstand”  -Trae Young
Trae young
Trae Young learned how to be an intimidating rim protector from watching Stockton game clips
Trae young.  It was those push ups that flipped the switch.
trae young and cp3 (cp is obvious)
"I'm just not gonna like.. go through the list of superstars that were out these playoffs with injury (and who was eliminated as a result of that) and then be like ""oh yeah but Donte"" after looking at Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Trae Young, etc. Just a dishonest comparison. The reason the dude says ""a starter"" instead of Donte is because everyone knows where Donte is and saying ""a starter"" sounds more important."
"Westbrook, CP3, and Trae Young are some that come to mind"
"Steph Kyrie Dame   Dame, potentially due to his offensive load, has been a bottom tier defender for the past 3 years. Close to Trae Young levels. Kyrie isn’t a good defender but he’s not that bad. Steph has a lot of issues on defence, but his awareness, IQ and off ball abilities are all above average. Overall I’d consider him an average/ slightly below average defender, above the other two"
"I’ve had the weirdest roller coaster with Trae Young. When he first broke out at Oklahoma, I loved him, and he was absolutely electric to watch. Then they hype train got out of control and his usage/chuckerism got really extreme, and I started hating him- I was really skeptical of the Hawks taking Trae over Luka. Then I realized he was a damn good NBA player who was getting underrated, and I liked him again. Then he really started getting into the foul baiting, and, especially at the beginning of this season, it was heinous to watch. I know other guys do it, but Trae’s flopping seemed especially melodramatic. Then, after watching him the playoffs (especially trash talking, then solo’ing the Knicks), I liked him again. I expect I’ll hate him for some reason by next season."
"I tend to like most players as they get older. Was a hardcore MJ guy and didn't want Kobe to catch him, but later on desperately wanted Kobe to beat Lebron and the other ""young guys"". I'm sure over time ill be cheering for Lebron vs. Trae Young. and then. cheering for Trae vs. some currently unborn child."
Trae young. Always thoughts he was a good stats bad team guy. Over reliant on shit foul calls from flopping and having the ball in his hands 24/7. After this past season’s playoff run it was hard not to root for and respect his game
Trae Young
Trae young
"I used to think size was a hard barrier to getting in the league but players like; Isaiah Thomas, Trae Young, CP3, and Kemba have shown that you can not only still get into the league if you’re skilled enough but you can be a top player too."
"Trae young for me, I thought he was a little cocky and just rubbed me the wrong way, but after last years playoffs he gained all my respect, the man is a killer."
Trae Young. I thought he was an overhyped empty stat guy but have come around.
"Trae Young came off as kinda a dick and seemed like he’d underperform but he made that team so hype, kinda dude you hate on another team but love on yours. He’s also got that young invincible feeling so it makes it fun knowing he could go off or not and both results are fun to watch"
"Don’t blame the Bad Boy Pistons, blame the refs and the league. They’re the ones who decided that the NBA would be a physical game back in the 80’s and 90’s, Detroit was just trying to win.  And I’d say the same thing to people who bitch about James Harden and Trae Young constantly flopping: don’t blame them, blame the refs and the league for allowing it. Those dudes are just trying to win basketball games."
"Blazers fans are very passionate and knowledgable, but also probably far more relaxed than the average fan base. In a bad way. You get sideways looks when you try to stand up and cheer at the rose garden.  Also a very respectful fanbase. I’m pretty sure the only two players who are universally hated by every blazers fan are Kobe Bryant and Raymond Felton. An “F Trae Young” chant or something along those lines definitely wouldn’t fly in Portland."
“TRAE YOUNG LOOKS LIKE MY DADS DICK”
"Trae Young.  I kinda did the exact opposite thing I did with CP3 : I only focused on the part of his game that I hated, his BS foul drawing, and I was so focused on that that I basically ignored the complete mastery he had in pick and rolls at such a young age, his passing especially is soooooo much fun to watch"
"I wonder if people have always tried to assume this *persecuted* character about liking the sports team they like, or if it’s an internet thing.   I realize the Kings have been bad for so long that they haven’t experienced other teams’ fans talking up their players but— there isn’t some conspiracy against bad team stars, especially those on their rookie contracts. They’re just hard to talk about and their teams are hard to watch. Trae Young got infinitely cooler in 2 playoff series than he was as a bad team star."
"Lol chanting ""F Trae Young"" on literally the third possession of Game 1 when he's done nothing to earn animosity and spitting on him is just a ""regular back and forth""? You can't dispute that Knicks fans were especially trashy that series when that's the garbage they pull."
"Yeah it's a big question of how difficult those 25 pts were. Is having this player on the floor like playing 4 v 5 on d, cuz then it's almost definitely not worth it, but Trae young level defense is certainly worth it for 25 and 10."
"Kobe didn’t say a single thing about Booker’s mentality, he just said he personally wants the double. You have Gilbert Arenas and Jameer Nelson, DBook has Trae Young, Kevin Durant. Both of those two stars talked about how doubling is some hoe shit and “only a few would understand.”   I’m saying most hoopers because anecdotally every dude I hoop with who played legit college ball all agreed with Book except 1. If someone who actually hoops doubled in a open gym, I’d be fucking shocked. Literally have only seen that when playing with guys who don’t hoop"
"[“DBook speaking facts...

"Not sure if the rivalry will last, although I hope it does, but Trae Young will be a MSG villain for the rest of his career"
#*IS TRAE YOUNG VALID?*  #NOOOOOO!
Trae Young is a productive NBA player
People care about Trae young. Cause he’s better than any Knick since Patrick Ewing 🥱
It isn’t even a rivalry. Just Knicks Fans angry at Trae Young
Trae young
Trae Young by miles lmfao bad argument
Would he dunk on trae young? That’s the only question i have anymore.
"Comparing fvv and trae young is different than Giannis and KD lol, but I agree KD is better rn"
FVV is a Top 50 player in the league. Can hit buckets and can clamp yo shit on D. Meanwhile we have Trae Young who’s probably the worst defender in the league but puts up 29/11 on good efficiency. Which point guard is better?
"You think Trae, Zion, and Tatum have no chance of being an mvp at any point in their career? What young players do you think have mvp potential besides Luka?"
"i mean going back to the playoffs. and back to his refusal to even try to shoot. a multimillionaire ball player who plugged his ears and said ""nya nya nya nya nyaaaa"" when his coach and team begged him to start playing offense.   a grown man nearly 7 feet tall who whimpered and ran away from *trae young* right next to the basket.  a crybaby who told his team that he would be sitting out from training camp, aka ""taking his ball and going home""  yeah, simmons has been kinda actin like a little bitch for a while now."
"I really disagree with this. Do you guys really think any of those young players are going to be as good as Simmons??. If you have the chance to get a premier player like Simmons to add to an already budding superstar like Trae, you would be stupid not to take it. It turns the Hawks from “that was a nice run” team to “They can win if the ball bounces their way”. Now of course maybe they don’t get Simmons. Maybe it’s Beal. Maybe it’s Lavine. But if you have the chance to get one of those guys it almost never ends up being worse for you than if you just ran it back. Remember the Lakers and AD, Toronto and Kawhi, Nets and Harden, PG and clippers, PG to OKC even. Do any of those teams regret it? Almost never. Trading young assets for a real star almost never fails. Hawks should absolutely do it if they have the chance. And yes, given the Hawks context I would even consider Simmons that caliber to them. Seamless fit."
I’m high on Trae Young so by process of elimination the most overrated Young player is Thaddeus Young.
"t-wolves make it over pels, zion gonna want out of the team  hawks gonna take top 3 seed and trae young is the dark horse for mvp (maybe a bit biased)  jazz gonna fall off  lillard won't get traded till the next offseason"
Score very well at the rim? He passed up an open dunk on Trae Young.
Trae young has a between the leg step back too but he launches back w 2 feet at the same time
https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1433209593988096000?s=21  Adam Sandler was working out with Trae Young a few days ago.
Didn't someone spit at Trae Young?
"Who do the Celtics jump to get to a 3-5 seed? Nets and Bucks obviously 1&amp;2, then the Hawks, Heat, 76ers, and Boston fighting for 3-6. Some people think the Bulls will be a top 5 seed, I'm not one of those people lol. Heat improved their roster more than the Celtics this off-season, the Hawks have way more depth in addition to having a younger/as young of a core (JJ, Trae, JC, KH, DH, Cam, &amp; Coop are all under 24 and CC is only 26, etc) and they're actually going to be healthy (hopefully), if the 76ers get a legit piece back for BS then they could still be a top 3 seed, etc. I just don't really see the Celtics making a jump unless these teams falter or get plagued by injuries. I'm not trying to be a dick, just wondering why you think they'll surpass any of those teams bc on paper it looks like they're a 5-6 seed at best right now."
Trae young. lol that midget isn’t stopping anyone on D
"You can be literal but the conversation is about more significant players. Nobody realistically factors that in as a major injury vs for example Kyrie or Trae Young or AD going out. If you need me to be exact then yea, Phoenix had an injured player. As it pertains to the person I replied to, I don't believe injury played a big enough role in the finals to mar the outcome."
"It's possible to keep 4-5, but it's also pretty unlikely unless this team is really really good. By 2023 you're going to me all in on Trae's last 3 years and IMO the move for the Hawks is to develop Cam/DeAndre and if they grow into the star role than great, but otherwise you should pivot to acquiring a star. It's just a tried and true pattern that always happens. It's not impossible, but for me the likely outcome is most of those guys are gone.   And for full disclosure Cam and DeAndre are two of my favorite players in the league, I played against them in High School and have been rooting for them for a long time. I just see the more likely outcome is the Hawks building 2-3 legit stars around Trae through trades. Tough business, as a sixers fan I've had to let go of a lot of great young guys"
He's just fortunate all universe defender Trae Young isn't there or else these clips would have a very different outcome.
"I think my more general point is that the future of this team is not Trae and the gang all growing together and everyone being happy. Either one of them will pop off and become another star, or Atlanta will look to find a star and trading their young guys is the easiest path to doing so.  Go look at the cap sheet, in 2 years after the 22/23 season Cam and DeAndre are eligible for extensions with Trae and Collins making 25+. Unless this team is the 2012 Thunder reborn they're just not going to keep all the guys together. After 3 seasons it's definitely going to be 1-2 because that's exactly what happened with every other good team in the east. Sixers, Celtics, Bucks, Heat, Nets etc. all have their star player(s) plus 1-2 role players from that 18/19 season. I don't think I'm being unrealistic, it's far more likely they trade these guys or they get larger contracts elsewhere than everyone getting paid and sticking around."
"lol I don't mean to be rude here but you really couldn't be more off the mark with this take.  Trae is untouchable, Hunter is untouchable, John just signed an extension and has very good chemistry with Trae, Cam is likely available but at a high price -- same with Heurter but we'll likely keep one of them long-term.  Capela isn't going to go anywhere because OO isn't ready to start, not to mention he's out the first half of the season.    &amp;nbsp;  **Gallo** is the most likely trade attached to **Cam** but other than that, I don't see us moving anyone else except maybe **Heurter** in a scenario where we get him extended.    &amp;nbsp;  I think it's really unlikely we trade more than one piece of the young core."
"It's the covid bump players. Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Deandre Ayton all got a pretty good reputation boost for being available when most of their peers were sick or hurt, but I think the biggest boosts went to **Jokic** and **Randle**.  Julius Randle is an elite player like Jokic is an MVP-- which is to say that his name is only coming up if 75% of the guys above him are hurt, sick, or both. They were prolific in the Covid-addled mess of 2020-2021, and so they got the attention. Now Jokic is pencilled in as an MVP candidate and Randle as an all-NBA level player going forward. Jokic is GREAT and Randle is GOOD, but we all know MVP and all-NBA, respectively, is NOT who those guys are."
"Just answered the questions here https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ph5ogv/the_athletic_the_hawks_definitely_have_the/hbh3md9/  Most of the players on the Hawks will be gone within 2 seasons, they have a nice young core to run with but at some point they'll move to acquire stars. I don't really care about his fit with Capela or Okongwu I think a good long term plan is to bring in Ben for a low price, sure up your defense and how Trae's range and the teams shooting to help space the floor for Ben. Go out and in a year or two find another high level guard/wing and there's a viable big 3 moving forward. I love the young guys on the Hawks due to personal connection but realistically Okongwu, Cam, DeAndre, Heuter etc. will either pop off and stay as a rotation piece or be traded. I'm thinking long term, not short term. I think the passing you get with Trae and Ben in a spaced floor would be a great fit for him"
"If you have an Athletic subscription their Hawks writer talked about in a mailbag https://theathletic.com/2801294/2021/09/01/ben-simmons-deals-disgruntled-star-fits-atlantas-ceiling-hawks-mailbag-part-1/  The Hawks are good and young and can just ride with what they have, but realistically only Trae and MAYBE 1-2 other guys are going to be on this roster in 2 years. Once you actually start competing they'll trade most of the guys you mentioned. I don't honestly have a good answer, but IMO you'd want Trae and Ben as the long term outlook and fit around those guys. I think Capela, Collins, Okongwu, Hunter etc. would all either find a role or be traded for someone who does. I think you could find a 3rd star with how many trade chips they have. Of course they should keep going with this young exciting roster but it's a stars league, if you could swing another great guard or wing and play Ben at the 4 with maybe a stretch 5 I like that direction a lot for Atlanta"
"Ben Simmons makes the most sense next to a guy like Trae Young. The passing on that team would be amazing, IMO Atlanta is one of his best fits in the whole league"
I can see how Trae Young is an intimidating defender compared to these guys
"Trae Young, most people think he's a great 3pt shooter, but the numbers just don't show it."
"Conversely, the Hawks didn't have a bunch of mid-career role players stepping up when Trae got hurt. They mostly had very young and high potential guys playing high quality basketball. They definitely need to give this core more time to develop before throwing away from promising young prospects for an older star"
Trae Young should be the Young

[Trae Young: Yo when we gonna say Drake has passed Hov ?](https://twitter.com/TheTraeYoung/status/1433684204240392215)
Trae Young. Dude just isn’t good.
"I'm not a nuggets fan and I wouldn't necessarily agree. I would reserve the ""terrible"" as descriptor for guys like Trae Young or Luke Kennard etc.  In fact I don't think I could argue for any center with minutes to be terrible at defense currently. Even guys like Enes Kanter or Jeff Green are somewhere from slighly negative to clear negatives.  With that in mind I don't really get why it's so impossible to argue for Jokic to being between slightly positive to neutral player on defense. I'm not even quite sure if he's in bottom 10 centers last season and I'd guess that there are less than 10 centers with decent minutes who actually were even negatives of defense."
Defense doesn’t matter. The Hawks beat us with a Trae Young Lou Williams backcourt when Ben didn’t play offense
"He was scared to score on Trae young because he didn’t want to get fouled and miss free throws.  No matter how good he is, he’s still expected to scored as the “second best” player on the team. He had 6 points in an elimination game, no matter how you flip it."
idk why people sleep on trae young as an elite rim protector tbh
@ hawks fan who told me Trae Young was a league average defender
yeah totally. On another note trae young has really improved his defence and is atleast passable now /s
"Trae Young. He's amazing and still a great scorer, but I feel like people overrate him a bit rn."
"Trae Young - Defense, argubly top 10 player in the league or something there idk"
Trae young 😳
Trae Young.
Trae young
"Everyone gets that part, you can get upvotes left and right for pointing that out. But the sixers fans are the only ones who watched ALL the games he's played in, and know how the system works/doesn't work. Our defense is built in large part due to him. Trae Young was forced into tons of bad looks because of Simmons, happened against Kawhi as well his defense was as good as it gets. Not everyone understand's his positive impact, much easier to just see the negative"
Trae Young
"Zion: Perimeter defense  Trae Young; Blocking cause why not  Drummond: At-rim finishing  Any good shooting big with a guard like handle would be fun to watch. JJJ, Lopez, KAT, Collins"
"Yes I can blame him. All he had to do was even attempt to be aggressive and score and he wouldn't have been thrown under the bus. We would've been focused on Embiid fading throughout the games cause his knee and conditioning, we'd be talking about Doc losing to the 5th seed as the 1st seed, we'd be talking about how the team didn't have enough players who can create shots off the dribble, we'd talk about how they lack a dynamic go to wing player. Ben brought all this on himself because when the series was on the line he saw 6'1 (being generous) Trae Young in front of him and decided to pass the ball instead of taking the shot and that play embodied every criticism of his game."
"No, we don't. We know suck and our trash but at least we own up to it.  Philly fans living are like schrödinger's cat  Gimme all your 1st rounders, all stars, young talents for Simmons.  Ben is trash we need to trade him.  And talking about winners, what has your franchise won? Getting bounced by trae young?   Couldn't even reach ECF in a historically weak year. Gtfo.  Pot calling the kettle black."
"The whole ""old school physicality is overrated"" take is overrated.   No, guys weren't jumping off the top rope and killing eachother, and that's not what's reminisced about anyways.   Most of the ""griping"" from older fans is more about the *kinds* of physical actions that are deemed fouls. There certainly seemed to be a lot more rough play that was allowed. There's a reason Reggie Miller shoved his way through screens, and why MJ bulked up to play against the Pistons.   Now, we're getting touch fouls for guys like Trae Young who literally jump backwards into a defender. It's different, and in comparison to what was once called, it's ""softer"".   Sure, they didn't jack up a ton of 3s back in the day, and there was a lot of iso play. But to suggest that ""the physicality is overrated"" is definitely a zoomer take if there was one."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Trae Young also super low to the ground and he’s making his money on shooting just like Curry.   Curry basically focuses on: release quickness, balance, and arc.   The way he gets open is just different and he wasn’t the guy to introduce it. He took a bit of Ray Allen’s playbook of constantly running and coming off of screens.  I can’t pinpoint what exactly but I’m sure Steph was a fan of Chauncey https://youtu.be/7RE4LCTp7wI  And Of course the handle being a big factor in Stephs success. But he’s not the first undersized PG with a great handle."
Trae young.
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"
KAT has made one 3rd team All-NBA and I think he'll be 1st team this year. My other pick is Trae Young.
Trae young probably will. I dont think ayton will.
TrAe young disrespect is blatant.
"Babyface will be Curry, or an outside chance it's Jalen Green.  Heel in the actual sense will be the Nets as a team, but the fun-to-hate, goofy, wrestling-style, ""I will most definitely be smiling if I get to take a picture with them after the game"" heel role firmly belongs to Trae Young and Joel Embiid. Last year people realized that those two guys are too good to disrespect and incredibly fun to root against."
I don't think you've put enough consideration into the fact that Trae Young is closer to Luka Doncic than Doncic is to James Harden!
"Allen Iverson comes to mind immediately. There's just no way your top scorer can be that inefficient, have limited perimeter pull-up game, and rely on fouls while also being defensively exploitable. Trae Young will struggle to win higher-level playoff series, too, for basically the same reasons. He has the perimeter scoring, but he's brutal on defense.  Among current/recent players, Russell Westbrook. Among 80s/90s players, John Stockton. It's happened very rarely that a point guard was the best player on a true championship-caliber team. Frazier, Payton, Curry. Maybe Mark Price."
"Heel will for sure be Nets overall with a side of Lakers. Baby face probably Bulls or Mavs. For players heel, Trae Young. Baby face Zach Lavine."
"That's Trae Young though, he regularly intimidates 6-11 socialites away from even attempting to dunk. It's no surprise Giannis was also unwilling to challenge him.  Whereas the last time Steph was in a position to challenge Giannis at the rim, Steph laid down on the FT line instead.  Clearly that means Trae is prime Mutombo defensively, while Curry is Shawn Bradley after the Monstars stole his mojo. If your white blood cells could play defense like Trae Young, you wouldn't need a mask or the vaccine."
Cp3 should be right behind Trae young
Watch Trae Young    Avoid Nic Batum
"Ben was actually worse last year than before, which is wild to think about.   His true shooting percentage is down, PER Is down, WS/48 is down, OBPM and BPBM is down, and per 100 went from 22.5/10.7/10.9 to 21.3/10.7/10.3, with half a steal less per 100 possessions.   Like, we see so many guys take a leap around age 24, HOW is he not doing at least 20/8/8? He’s capable, look at his game log, he did 34/12/12 in 2020, 42/9/12 against the jazz, 23/11/9 this past year  But he has more instances of 5/6/5 in 35 mi utes, 8/1/6 in 26 minutes, 8/10/2 in 33 minutes, 8/7/1 in 24 minutes 9/12/2 in 38 minutes, 10/3/3 in 24.5 minutes, 11/4/4, 11/4/2  Other all NBA players don’t put up those kinds of duds. He had 13 games with a game score under 10 in 2021. For context, Luka had 5, Trae had 8, Zion had 2, Tatum had 8, Booker had 11, Mitchell had 7.  Most of those guys are mvp candidates or close. But they’re all all stars and they’re all young players, 25 or under, and when the 76ers drafted Simmons the hype and expectation would be that he would be a top player in the league, not a guy who gives you absolute duds in a quarter of his games. How do you average 10 a game against the Hawks? The hawks are talented but who on their team, who on any team is guarding a 6’11 freight train? Why isn’t this guy scoring 20??   I usually refrain from saying a guy doesn’t care or commenting on work ethic because you have to work your ass off to get to the NBA, I scoff at those posts that say “if nick young had Kobe’s work ethic he would be an all star” as if nick young didn’t work his ass off. But why isn’t Ben Simmons better??"
"Tim Duncan is a great player to watch, his game offensively was very fundamentally based and he was a great defender.  A player to avoid is Trae Young, his shot selection is not good and it leads to terrible deep 3’s"
"It's moreso that there should be significant improvement from the young guys like Ja, Fox and Trae"
"Trae Young is the immovable object, hence, Simmons could not dunk over him."
Fred VanFleet = all-star  Trae Young = future all-star
"Hawks young core is significantly better than yours and improving. Trae, Collins, Hunter, Reddish, Heurter, JJ, Sharife, OO. They’re much more stacked than you guys"
"yes. Trae Young === Steph Curry, Bogdonavic === Klay Thompson, and John Collins === Draymond Green. The Hawks have obviously figured out the NBA and will go 74-8 and leave LeOld James in the dust before signing Luka in 2025"
"Hawks are light on top end talent. I would argue they're the deepest team in the league, but our 2 &amp; 3 spot don't compete with the nets or the bucks. A lot of the team is young and good still take leaps, but they need another established star to pair with Trae."
SGA and Trae Young are the most slept on. Trae is gonna be an MVP candidate and SGA will be an All-Star.
Superstar = potential #1 option on champ squad.  Superstars: Giannis &amp; Steph   All stars: Donovan Mitchell &amp; Jason Tatum   Roleplayers:  * Trae Young * Jrue Holiday * Khris Middelton * DeAndre Ayton * Karl-Anthony Towns * Julius Randle * Klay Thompson  * Booker
Summer league Trae Young
"&gt; You know what is a bit fresher in my memory than a regular season record in a pandemic year? Trae Young lobbing to John Collins off the backboard in a playoff game. Embarrassing.  That was against the Bucks, my dude.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEynghuXMP0&amp;ab_channel=BleacherReport  Good try on the memory thing, though"
They had a high seed because Bud was smoking crack with weird lineups on the bucks sideline and the Nets were diddling themselves during the regular season. You know what is a bit fresher in my memory than a regular season record in a pandemic year? Trae Young lobbing to John Collins off the backboard in a playoff game. Embarrassing.
It’s gonna be someone like Trae Young or Luka who wins MVP next year.
"I can't emphasize enough how recent of a phenomenon jacking from 30-plus really is. Granted, it'd been done from time to time, but it was always a rare and special moment (like Reggie in his 25-point fourth quarter against New York).   Steph really did change the game. I'm 37 and watching that dude fire the way he does (and watching how his disciples like Trae Young do similarly) still blows my mind. I just can't stop thinking about how just 10 years ago we'd generally lampoon anyone for attempting half the shots we see now (though guys like Vince Carter were slowly chipping away at mega deep balls, even if it was generally nothing like what we see now)."
Trae young
I fully acknowledge how good Trae Young is but he's one of the few players I wouldn't want on our team just cause I'm too invested in hating him.
Trae Young?
"Ben Simmons doesn't deserve to be mentioned next to an all-time socialite like Paris Hilton. Her performance in the clubs is just next level, her schmoozing skills are top notch. While Ben Simmons is sitting at home playing Fortnite, Paris Hilton is out on the grind, dominating those sex tapes.  Also, she would definitely have dunked on Trae Young."
"The first that comes to mind is Trae young. I did say superstar scorer, so it can’t just be a random good starter. Needs to be a star."
"Someone who has an all star selection but isn’t consistently getting 1st/2nd team all NBA like Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Lavine, Randle, or Zion versus the likes of Curry, Luka, LeBron, Jokic, Giannis, KD."
He has a similar defensive rating to Trae Young bro 😂  There’s a reason coaches hide him in the corner
Give Wall *that* layup with Trae Young as rim protector and he’d absolutely POSTER that boi
"Game was slower. Mpg is relevant, possessions is they basically play the same number of possesions about 75 per star per game. Young LeBrons offensive load is substantially lower than players like Jokic, Trae, Luka and Harden. This means they have the opportunity to rack up more points and assists on a shorter time frame as well. Not even accounting for more efficient offences generating more assists,"
"Tim Hardaway was an All Star and I loved watching Glenn Robinson at Purdue.  So what I’m saying, kids, is think about this in a couple decades when you’re watching Trae Young Jr. in a shootout against Donavan Mitchell III or whatever.   That’s when you’ll *really* feel old."
hahaha why don’t you spit on Trae young again.
Trae Young is that guy my guy
Tell that to Trae Young.
"What you're looking for are superstar/star players who run their teams offense and/or rarely play off-ball *or* focus on creating their own shot.  For example, the best-worst team (with some wiggling of positions) I can think of would be;  PG: Trae Young  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Joel Embiid  To be fair Embiid would probably slot in alright, but in terms of star C's it's really either him or Jokic and I worry the latter would be able to corral the rest of the time into playing well off-ball."
By OPs definition I don't see any reason why Trae Young isn't a superstar.
"Because making 2-3 threes per game on ~40% shooting isn’t all that uncommon now.  There isn’t much of an argument for Reggie being a better shooter than Klay, Steph, and Dame IMO.  All of them make more threes at better percentages. So at best, you could put him at #4 if he played today.  Then there are several more that either make slightly less on higher percentages, or make more on slightly lower percentages.  That’s why I said he might not be a top 5 shooter if he were in the NBA today.  I could see an argument for him at #4.  But I could also see arguments for putting Harden and Durant above him.  I also suspect Trae Young will surpass him in a few years."
Trae young will be an MVP candidate.
If Harden is a pg then Kyrie is a sg.  Lillard? Trae Young? No
"I’m not assuming anything other then trae young, the hawks best player, who was already having an amazing game, would have made it much harder for the bucks to win. Is that wrong?"
Trae Young  Source: You know
TRAE FUCKING YOUNG. He will be in the MVP discussion next season after the Hawks earn the one seed in the East.
"I mean I'm not doing that, I'm just not playing butterfly effect to get a result I want. 'If Trae Young doesn't step on the refs foot then Middleton doesn't shoot 8/13' is a silly take, because if you can say that then I can say 'If Donte wasn't injured Trae Young would've averaged 40 FG% in Game 1' and we both have the same argument.   Even if Trae Young hit every shot he took in the 4th quarter and scores 43 instead of 35, Bucks would still have won. Trae Young stepping on the ref's foot didn't cause Bogdan and Huerter to combine for 1/6, and I hate to break it to you but Trae wasn't about to break out some lockdown defense on Middleton.   If you want to play butterfly effect nonsense where Trae Young *actually* ends up playing more minutes than he did in any other game for some reason, and somehow ends up having the best quarter of the game (despite the fact that across the series Trae never shot better than .250 in any fourth quarter, and in the blowout Game 2 he shot 1/4 in the last quarter he played in before garbage time) then go ahead but it's weird and just reaching for a conclusion you prefer."
The fact that you’re assuming that entire 4th quarter plays out the same way even if trae young was holding his leg in the corner the whole time is hilarious
"Can I push back on this a little, or at least qualify it? Superstar to me is elite NBA player *and* huge name/marketability.   To me, Kawhi, Embiid, and Jokic don't have the marketability aspect of a ""superstar."" Zion and maybe Trae Young probably draw more attention/make headlines more than those guys, even though they're better players."
"Impact in basketball terms, is objective on a season to season basis. It’s pure math. How your team is with you present vs when you sit. When that’s not all that matters when gauging offence because that can be circumstantial. With defence, there’s nothing else to evaluate,it’s far less circumstantial and in my point, I was looking at a sample over multiple years. You can’t say I have no point when I raised 3 points you were either too lazy or too incompetent to refute.  Plus even with your very stupid attempt at a strawman, it’s incorrect. Nikola Jokic would be the standard as the most impactful offensive player, not Trae young."
"Lillard, harden, steph, doncic, cp3 (at least his last two years on okc and the Suns although kyrie could easily be better than cp3 this year), trae young"
"Huerter in terms of his role on a championship level team. Where a superstar heliocentric ball handler like Trae Young or James Harden controls majority of your possessions with high pick and rolls and secondary guys like Huerter or Bogi creates some offense with limited usage to either allow the super star a rest or they are feeding off the super star’s usage.   It’s pretty much consensus from the people from the Stepien, DP, and Jackson Frank that only Cade and Green have that potential to be that superstar on a championship team. Suggs would likely top off as that second option."
Do you would agree that Trae Young is the best offensive player in the league?  His on/off over the past two years in the regular season for offense has been the best in the league.
"Just like Trae Young this past season, as soon as KAT gets a playoff worthy team around him people will finally understand just how good he is. I hope it doesn’t take a chance of scenery, but he is easily the most underrated player in the league. His scoring efficiency for being a big man is unreal.   He’s been through a lot, he’s an inspiration off the court. And in due time he’ll get all the credit that he deserves for the player that he is on it as well"
I'm perplexed that people keep posting Luka Doncic clips after we already established that Trae Young is closer to Doncic than Doncic is to Harden.
The Hawks won as many games in the ECF with Trae Young as they did without him
I didn't realise the Hawks were using Trae Young to guard Middleton that game.
"I think you’re picking hairs here. Both guys are really healthy guys and not usually injury prone. Giannis goes up for like 500 alley oops a season. It’s a common thing to do for him. If Trae young tore his acl doing a crossover, it’d still be a freak accident IMO."
Didnt it happen to trae young two seasons ago?
"It's not just for shooting on the perimeter. Abruptly changing your path (sideways or backwards - think Trae Young when he jumps backwards on a drive into his defender), hooking a defenders arm, kicking your leg/s out at abnormal angles on the shot. All those are included in the rule changes.  Good example they give is [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/NBAOfficial/status/1424438136017408000) but the whole thread is helpful too."
"It isn’t, I regret spending the money. I was just hyper into the NBA and wanted to watch all the young players. I think the years I got it were 2017-18 and 2018-19. There were tons of promising young players and I enjoyed getting to watch the players who didn’t get any national attention at the time like Booker, Trae, KAT etc.  I had a well paying job at the time and was way too loose with my money, so it didn’t bother me. Now I realize how dumb it was."
Trae Young has a center who can play defence.
Trae Young for Dominique Wilkins?  Honestly I'm going to say no
Is Trae Young valid??
"idk why but i consider 16-6-6 to be the lamelo statline.  trae young owns the 30-10+ games for me.  deandre jordan, dwight howard and robert williams are 7-14-3 block guys.  can't forget the bradley beal 35-2-3"
"Jamal Murray would not be a household name because he is not a top 5 player unlike K.D... At least bring up Jokic's name instead. Media can only control so much. Lakers have such long lasting history and fanbase and same with teams in New York that you can't just blame it on media unless you have no idea how any of it works.   K.D on thunder did not have as much spotlight because it was in a smaller market, i.e less fans. Media does not make the fanbase bigger. Stop with this nonsense. Media talked a lot about Lebron when he was on cavs and media is constantly hyping Luka and Trae Young, both not in super large markets."
Trae Young one is just wrong
"a 6'1 muscle bound monster like Trae Young   He’s 5’11 at best, they stat paddin’ him!"
Trae young looks like my dads dick! Not that I’ve ever seen my dads dick. Trae young looks like a piece of shit!
"First order of business: don't keep Trae Young off the roster cuz of Lloyd ""El Pee"" Pierce"
Trae Young&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Trae young isn’t efficient enough
Nah that’s Trae Young
not irrational but trae young
"Trae Young and Chet Holmgren, unstoppable smh."
He didn't exactly say rich man's Trae Young!
"&gt;being afraid to dunk over Trae Young of all people,  That's one isolated moment where he made a terrible decision, and people are reading into it like it's the story of his whole career. He's still a DPOY candidate and a multiple time all star.  &gt;He hasn’t improved one skill in a meaningful way in his entire time in the league   His defense has improved massively since coming into the league. Yeah ideally he'd improve more on offense or at least play more aggressive, but there's no telling what might happen in a new environment. He's worth taking a chance on."
Well Grant is also a co owner of the Hawks so a least there will be no more Trae Young snubs on Team USA in the near future
Listen man if I had a 6'1 muscle bound monster like Trae Young coming at me like a freight train you best believe I'm not sacrificing my body. Ben Simmons is a fragile 6'10 you can't expect him to take on a pre-bald Thanos
"*Bunch of All NBA defender players like Trae young, Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams."
"In all fairness, he is only afraid around the 4 ft mark when guarded by DPOY candidates like Trae Young."
"Also, fearing a 6 foot at best Trae Young will block your dunk/layup while being 6 foot 10"
Trae Young has gotta be either waluigi or wario
"You took my attitude comment to be about the recent drama, but I’m more so concerned about a 6’ 10” atheltic beast being afraid to dunk over Trae Young of all people, and his general lack of enthusiasm for the game. He hasn’t improved one skill in a meaningful way in his entire time in the league"
So he doesn’t play anything like Trae Young
"Bucks are a better team without Giannis than the hawks are without Trae Young, both teams were injured though there’s no excuses"
"Nah my guy dunks on everyone, even Trae Young."
Hawks need a pediatric doctor cause Trae young looks like he could be a Rugrat
Traumatized by Trae Young under the basket. I'd say Simmons gets a pass.
Trae Young is not underrated by this sub
a poor mans Trae young without the floaters &amp; any basically anything inside the 3 point line
"harden's team took one of the best teams we've seen in history to 7 games, meanwhile you guys had a guy crowned as a generational superstar and still couldn't get a better playoff record than the rookie celtics for 5 years.   congrats on your ring, but when you beat the nets by 1 point because they had injured stars and you only just get past the hawks with an injured trae young you don't get to talk down to harden about carrying teams"
Trae Young was underrated by this sub a few months ago. No way in hell he's underrated now.
"He wouldn’t be out of place on a top 4 list, but you could still solidly put Curry, Dame, Westbrook, Doncic as a top 4 and there are a couple others like Trae Young that would be reasonable to rank there."
Trae Young is better than LeBron because Trae has never lost a finals 😉
Brian Windhorst absolutely blows by Trae Young  “Well maybe not as hard as I thought”
"Idk how many times that empty stats BS needs to be disproven over and over again before people stop with that garbage take. Trae, Booker and Lavigne all got hit with that shit. Surprisingly 1 young player can't carry a team."
Big facts man's was scared to dunk on trae young that tells you all you need to know.
Did you wait for a verdict when your fan spit on Trae Young?
"&gt;How did Trey Young play against Ben Simmons' elite defense?  Simmons was guarding Ice Trae?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Whole lotta words in your comment  Truth spoke too.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;you still never answered the question: where were the sixers in the standings (with Maxey, no Ben Simmons)?  I do not know. But, I do know where Maxey was while Simmons elite defense and playmaking were leading factors in Philly gaining a #1 seed."

"Steph has been a very good team defender since 2013-14.  More specifically, he's good at being at the right position as the defense changes/moves.  While he does have lapses off-ball he's usually in the best position to intercept passes, provide help or block out for rebounds   As an on ball defender Curry is an average or below average defender due to his relatively small size and athleticism.  Curry does a decent/good job of staying in front of larger guards/wings such as Lebron, PG, Harden, Westbrook etc but is too small too effect their shots.  Curry has the most trouble defending against smaller quicker or shiftier guards like JA, CP, Trae, etc.  In the past young Brandon Jennings, Sacramento IT were examples of quick, fast guards that Curry had trouble defending,"
That's because unless all your players are good scorers  attacking a player with your weakest offensive talent is often worse than attacking a good defender with your all NBA scorer.    That's the same thing with trae young at the moment. He maybe the worst star defender I've ever seen but posting him up is worse than running your usual sets
i feel like really bad is reserved for guys like trae young and lou williams. Curry is passable for a guard his size or slightly below average
"The asterisk is then deleted for the point that yes, obviously, but put Ben Simmons in that position and he's scared to dunk on Trae Young."
"Giannis, Jokic, Embid, AD, Bam, Towns  Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Luka, PG, Zion  Tatum, Brown, Butler, Harden,   Trae, Dame, Morant, Beal.  That's 20 and I haven't even included Booker, Mobley, Donovan, LaMelo, Ant, Lavine, Ayton, Simmons and other young stars."
"Ben 100% has a mental thing going on and there’s zero shame in that. In part, us Philly fans are to blame. It’s easy to trace. He couldn’t hit free throws, and hack-a-ben worked, so he stopped putting the ball up, leading to the infamous non-dunk on trae young. Philly fans just want to see our guys leave it all on the court, and Ben had a mental thing going on that prevented that. Our fans destroyed him because of that.  Ben’s first actual mistake is how he responded to that. He acted entitled - blaming others, blaming Doc. Quotes about him wanting the focus on him and not on Embiid. Idk if this was criminal mismanagement by his agent/his circle, or from him personally. Regardless, he went scorched earth on Philly and took it personally. When it was clear that this approach wasn’t going to get him out the door right away, he’s now reverted to the mental health stuff. And I can understand not wanting to put the mental health stuff out right away. It makes you feel like less of a man to admit it. I get it, I’ve been depressed for a couple years now and talked with a couple people about it, and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But he still chose to go scorched earth right away instead of being silent, working to improve his craft, or just shutting up and appreciating how lucky he is to make $170,000,000.  So bringing the mental health stuff up now just makes it look like he is resorting to the mental health angle to get him out of playing / get him out of Philly. And that’s not going to fly when you turned your back on the organization already. So while I sympathize with his mental issues, because I know they must be real, he made his bed already with his guns blazing approach. Sixers did everything they could for him. Morey shouldn’t trade him for peanuts, but we also aren’t getting Dame or Jaylen Brown or those caliber guys. I really hope a team offers a fair package so everyone can move on."
"Fans bully him because he deserves it. He doesn't have the mamba mentality that if you got embarrassed like Kobe did in the 97 playoffs, where he should lock himself up in the gym improving yourself, not bitching about fans bullying u for passing up a dunk against Trae fucking Young"
"I mean yeah he was scared of 6' Trae Young during the playoffs, got publicly trash talked by his teammate and coach, and knows if he ever steps foot on a court in his city he'll get booed to hell so he's def got some issues. He still a bitch tho for how he's been handling this"
"After getting downvoted when the rule changes were announced for saying Trae Young would have to change his game, this gives me some sense of validation. The biggest surprise for me on this list tho is BI. He's not someone I think of as a foul baiter."
"The mental issues Ben has: 1. Ben always see Trae Young as Shaq. 2. Ben sees a basketball ring as a relationship, which he cannot commt seriously."
You wouldn't either if you had Trae 'gunslinger' Young in front of you
"and the sixers lost to trae young last year and got swept in the first round the year before but people still think they are contenders  this is like talking to a brick wall, you don't seem to understand the words I'm typing"
"As Simmons approached the rim, Trae Young started to rise with him, giving some thought to contesting the dunk attempt. But the cowardice may have surprised him. Doc wanted to see that fire from Simmons, especially after Jimmy Butler’s exit, one that implicated Simmons as too soft around the league. Simmons shrugged it off like he did everything else. Nothing got to him. Nothing bothered him, except for the entirety of the past 4 months and how things ended in game 7.  What really bothered Simmons, according to players who have kept in touch with him since he stopped reporting to camp, was the perceived hypocrisy of it all. One thing that Morey has always valued is family. It is everything to him. So when Morey arrived and started to preach the importance of family to Simmons, organized a trip to the Wells Fargo Center for shooting drills, and met with Rich Paul, it resonated with him. At a Phillies game during Simmons’ first summer on the job, Morey cradled Kendall Jenner in his arms and promised to build a relationship not just with Simmons the player, but Simmons the person.Morey preached the importance of staying together, of bonding and fighting and making free throws even when they were undermanned. So when Morey tried to trade him for Lillard, 3 firsts, and future second, Simmons didn’t flip out, because he never flips out. But he did find it funny, all that talk about family and togetherness only to see Morey try to trade him before his tenure was even a year old. Then came Simmons’ unceremonious exit just before training camp, and it did not go unnoticed.  “That man can’t fucking shoot” Embiid said with disdain to anyone who asked him about the attempted trade."
"Ben: ""They keep showing me pictures of Trae Young protecting the rim, saying it's okay to try and dunk on him, like he aint Mutumbo reincarnated."""
"I get everyone hates Simmons, thinks he's faking, haha that picture with Trae Young, and yeah it doesn't let good.   But Devils advocate, isn't Philly being absurd here? Simmons gets told pack his bags in a trade that falls through(after years of being shopped), Simmons has a bad playoff series and gets thrown under the bus by his teammates and coach. He says fine trade me then. Sixers ask for a ludicrous amount for a player that they just greatly reduced the value of. The player has mental health issues stemming from going back to the place where he'll be booed relentlessly when he steps on the court full of people who threw him under the bus. The organization says fuck off you're faking see our staff instead of your personal therapist. You meet with him, say he can speak to your personal therapist, and then the team says meet with him again so he can clear you to play.   Sure, Simmons may(probably) be faking, but the Sixers organization has fucked this whole thing from the start. They penny pinched assets to prevent acquiring Harden. They throw Simmons under the bus, want to trade him for absurd amount, and now they don't actually want to play the season out with Simmons, they want him to come play solely to raise his trade value."
Trae young really did all this while playing defense in the post
Ben Simmons still having nightmares about Trae Young guarding him at the rim
He does at least in part - he was afraid of 6’1” Trae Young blocking his shot or fouling him on an open dunk after all.
"Sure, but the Sixers don't have Trae Young to help carry the offense."
I’ve been suggesting this for a minute now and it just makes sense. Trae/KAT should be an interesting duo and it allows Atlanta to bypass the awkward who do you keep phase. Minnesota gets some young players to build around and some draft picks.

It’s actually one of the easiest to follow advanced stats to follow out there.  There’s a link in the comment section explaining it.  But if you want to use more common models:  -Grayson is at .177 WS/48 -Luka is at .068 -Trae Young is at .108
"AD had pre injury Boogie in 2018 who is FAR better than anyone on Minnesota  And Jrue &gt; DLo as well, DLo is an inefficient chucker who is nearly as bad as Trae Young on defense and isn't an exceptional playmaker either"
Trae Young would never
"Oh idunno, new young players like Ja Morant, Trae Young, Luka, Zion, etc."
"There was a post at the peak of the circlejerk showing how in one game against the Hawks, 6/13 assists had players dribble or in other ways make space before taking the shot. This is, of course, **one game**. It's also the exact same way it works for every single player.  It's like showing a video of Trae Young playing good defense (take the recent one where he stopped Gobert at the rim) and claiming he's a good defender . The only people who would ever upvote that are those who have never seen the guy play outside of that video. If he happened to drop 60 the day before, that defensive play would also get more praise, similarly to how Simmons being unable to shoot a FT to save his life made people say ""akshually he's not a great passer""."
There are 100% exceptions to that rule. While the Grizzlies are young team Ja Morant has quickly turned them into consistent playoff team. Luka has turned the Mavs around. Trae had to go through a couple years of G league squads but is leading a young team as well. Ant has the potential.
Beat Trae Young before you talk shit
"James Harden, Trae Young, and now Damian Lillard are the most vocal critics against the new rule changes.  I for one, am shocked"
Lillard I'd say is the 3rd worst foul baiter in the league after Harden &amp; Trae Young. He not only stops short but he also jumps into the defender coming up on his side to sandwich him into the picker who is also moving in towards Lillard - it's like 2 offensive fouls packaged together that used to consistently be called a 3-point defensive foul.  Also Lillard is the king of running into people and then flopping his head back to draw a foul. Now that all of this is gone - it turns out he's not a superstar really. No surprise he's upset. But explains a lot about why the Blazers never seem to make a deep playoff run and often got exposed hard. Those tricks never worked in the playoffs either.
You mean this sub jumped the gun on a player after his first few games?????  Good thing known busts trae young and lamelo ball are here to prove us right
Trae young
"Jimmy too.  Also trae young, a guy who a lot of people thought would be affected the most after harden is doing solid individually even though his team has been losing lately."
"Quite a few, but they're either much younger, smaller, or skinnier. And of course plenty that aren't even stars.  Lamelo is awful but he's young and if he gets stronger and shows the drive he'll be great. Westbrook is known for letting players go by despite being one of the best athletes in the game. Same with Harden even though he is stout in the post. Trae is too small and skinny. A lot of the rookie guards are awful defenders.  But the thing is we see guys like FVV play great defense. Campazzo is a pest. It's honestly about effort and energy. Lillard is a pretty good athlete and expends a lot of offense, but he could obviously be a better defender."
"As an old school fan, I looooove Jimmy but he’s also a bit of an asshole / had a very hard life and is not on the same page with younger stars that were highly coddled from age 14+.  So KAT could still work out but he needs someone like Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, or a similar player that wants to be the guy. But on his own he just doesn’t have the fire to lead a team."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
It’s the same as Trae Young driving in the lane and stopping to draw a foul just on a different angle. 2 times in his whole career?!?! That is super homer view
Trae Young seems to be havin a rough go as well
"Yo OP, your tables are a little messed up. If you put --- | --- | --- | --- between the header and the rest of the table, it will change it into a much better looking version:  Player|2021-21|2020-21|Diff ---|---|---|--- Damian Lillard|3.2|7.2|-4 Bradley Beal|4|7.7|-3.7 Trae Young|5.3|8.7|-3.4 Collin Sexton|3.5|6.4|-2.9 James Harden|4.6|7.3|-2.7 De'Andre Hunter|1|3.7|-2.7 Kyle Lowry|1|3.5|-2.5 Kemba Walker|1.2|3.5|-2.3 Donovan Mitchell|3.9|6|-2.1 Joel Embiid|8.6|10.7|-2.1  Well, I had to change the spaces between the numbers into | but it looks better that way, and you can even sort it based on the column"
Trae young make dame look like jrue holiday
"tbh trae young aint gonna make it with how the hawks are doing record wise. he missed it last year too. If he makes it now, its gonna be off of last seasons playoff run."
Well that and Trae Young being the most dominant PG at rim protection
Jarrett Allen instead of Trae Young/Jaylen Brown
"That's odd, I don't remember the press conference where the Sixers blamed every bit of their failure on Simmons and nothing else. There were two comments. Joel saying the turning point of the game was the Simmons ""scared to try to score on Trae Young in the post"" play, and doc answering a question about Ben's ability to be a championship point guard. That's it. After the franchise coddled him for years."
"Exactly, Ben Simmons was an Allstar last season while Trae Young wasn't, yet we all saw how the two performed when it mattered the most."
Steph offended that Trae Young doesn’t have him in his top 5 favorite players of all time.  Yet he literally models his entire game off Steph.  Smh
"Its human nature. Like how a lot turned on Trae Young at Oklahoma cause ESPN was spamming him everywhere. Or with Zion at Duke.  And if a certain fanbase gets on someone's nerves, they're prolly not gonna be huge fans of players on that team lol"
No offense to Mobley but this isn’t nowhere near the level of play of Luka’s rookie campaign.  The fact that their is a debate between him and Scottie says as much.  Trae Young had an incredible rookie year and everyone still had Luka ahead.
"Trae Young, Jaylen Brown"
Or Trae Young or Brandon Ingram
"Just last night he defended Trae Young, preventing him from scoring, and then was able to recover and switch back to block Capela's layup.   You don't know what you're talking about."
"Curry probably loved it, makes it so guys like trae young get clearly differentiated into a worse tier than him"
Defence and offence are not equally valuable in the NBA.    Draymond would be a max player if that were the case and trae young would be on $20 mil a year not the max.
Ja's defense is awful  Like if you look at his on court impact he might be even worse than Trae Young or at least on par
"Some could be lizard people. Here's looking at you Trae Young. Can't be that slippery and not be a lizard, come on now."
Trae Young focused on making first team all defense
"So Simmons is Magus and Embiid is Frog and since Embiid (Frog) has turned down the choice to kill Simmons (Magus) because it won't bring Chrono (Jimmy Butler) back, Simmons decides to join the gang because he has a score to settle with Lavos (Trae Young)?"
"There was [this](https://twitter.com/TheTraeYoung/status/1343269894268334080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343269894268334080%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop) which some people think was deliberate. To me his first step just accidentally comes down between his teammate and Trae's foot, and the second step is a result of his foot being caught on Trae."
Seems Allen doesn't really get much into trouble any more.  Last incident I heard was when Trae Young pushed him.  Has there been anything else?

Him and Trae Young both couldn’t last a month without hollering
"Yes, besides the Nuggets series this year, he either always underperforms or is cripplingly average in the playoffs. That's why I mentioned his ""reputation"". People think Dame is a playoff killer on a bad team and this year's playoffs just added more fuel to the fire. He has always been so-so in the playoffs. For example, he was the 3rd  best player in the Nuggets-Blazers series in 2019 after Jokic and CJ. For a superstar to be the 3rd best player in a series with CJ and a 23 talented but young center is unacceptable and embarrassing. Also, as you mentioned the fact that Dame couldn't take a game off the crippled Warriors tells you everything you need to know about Dame the playoff player.  Besides all this, let's not even talk about the series Dame had against Jrue Holiday and the pelicans where Dame was made to look like a role player. Comparatively, even Trae in his first playoffs faired better against Jrue,   As I mentioned this ""reputation"" is definitely the general consensus about Dame for the average NBA fan. The thing is Dame played a big part in constructing this reputation with all this talk of loyalty, having no help, and not joining a super team. This ""reputation"" is also why Dame is in the Top 75 over some other more deserving candidates"
"He has guys do a lot of ball handling for him so he can run around off ball. Doesn't attack the paint as much either. Curry drives 8x a game, the Lillards and Hardens are at 12 and the guys like Trae Young are at 20.  So, less opportunity for the increase in physicality to fuck him"
"I mean what the Hawks beat reporter originally tweeted out was  &gt; Trae Young on the difficulty of sacrificing early in the season: ""I think guys are learning that. We're no longer the hunters. It's regular season. I'm not going to lie, it's a lot more boring than the playoffs. You got to find that motivation to play like the playoffs.""  With the last sentence, it seems very possible that he’s acknowledging that the regular season isn’t as exciting and saying that despite that fact, the team can’t get complacent and they need to figure out how to play hard every night anyway."
Trae young backup
This the Trae Young Ben Simmons was worried about
"I think Trae Young slept with his mother or something, because he was screeching ""lMaOoOoOoO hAwKs aReNt cOnTeNdERs!!!!!!!"" for no reason at me earlier. My point wasn't even about that lol."
the last split second looks like whiteside about to morris trae young
"Trae Young intimidated a 6'11"", 240lb NBA All-Star. You can't measure that toughness."
"The thing is, AI didn't really ""dominate."" He scored a lot of points, but he didn't actually win very much. He won five playoff series in his career.  And it's somewhat telling that the year they made the finals (a year in which at least 3 and maybe 4 western teams would have been favored over them) they had the fifth best *defense* in the league. And that wasn't because of AI.  From 1997 (his rookie year) to 2007, AI led a bottom-10 offense *eight* times, against *zero* with a top-10 offense. Because his efficiency was so bad, you were basically relying on AI's ability to create good looks for his teammates in order to have a passable offense, but AI liked shooting, and wasn't a natural distributor.   AI was one of the first battlegrounds in the analytics evolution. When he was a young player, the conventional wisdom was that you couldn't apply analytics to basketball. It was too complex, there were too many variables. By the end of his career, the idea that low-efficiency high-volume scorers were almost impossible to build a good offense around no matter how exciting and dynamic they were.   AI could only win an MVP in the modern era in a year where narrative was more important than winning. e.g. Derek Rose (similarly, a guy who was the best offensive player on a team that won with defense and everybody was mad at LeBron so didn't want to vote for him), or Westbrook (when people decided that stat-padded triple doubles were really important, and everybody was mad at Steph and KD so nobody wanted to vote for them).   I get downvotes whenever I point this out about AI. Don't care. It's true. I was there. He was incredible exciting. He was a much-watch player. He made impossible-looking shots and had SPECTACULAR highlights. But Philly's offensive struggles were very much a function of his game.  The league is smarter, now. The analytics guys who were mocked when they pointed out the issues with AI now run the league. It's really hard to imagine someone like Trae (who doesn't have AI's efficiency problem) going first, although, I mean, in weak drafts surprises happen, just because of the defensive challenges he presents."
Trae Young would think otherwise
Is that [this](https://twitter.com/TheTraeYoung/status/1343269894268334080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343269894268334080%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop)? How is this not just running?
"Trae young looks like my dads dick  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I-Ive never seen my dads dick, h-he still looks like shit."
"Sure, guess you can say up to now….but only one has been to a conference finals. And I’ll admit my pick is based on projection, I think trae young will have the better career. Guess we’ll see."
I’m a GP2 fan but I gotta say Trae Young toasted him this round. A welcome to the bright lights kind of moment for Young Glove.
I got trae young winning an mvp in the next 3-5 years
you be alright ur facing some scrub with trae young  and paul george
Players develop and adjust at different speeds. 3 weeks in Trae Young looked like he didn’t belong in the NBA. Same with Edwards
"Who wins a pre-30 vs post-30 game in the NBA?   **Pre:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Post:** Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic."
"Trae Young and James Harden comes to mind.  Obviously great players and all that, but still."
For some reason Twitter idiots overrate shooting and underrate athleticism. Lot of Trae Young fans on Twitter.
"Not an unfair criticism. Just want to remind you that Trae averages a +6.3 box plus-minus across his playoff career, while Randle is -3.5, on top of being 4 years older.  Here’s some other stats to compare:  Julius Randle    Games Played (Career): 457    eFG% (Career): 51.1%   Total Rebounds per game (Career): 9.2    Assists per game (Career): 3.4    Steals per game (Career): 0.7    Blocks per game (Career): 0.5    Points per game (Career): 17.5     Trae Young    Games Played (Career): 215     eFG% (Career): 49.8%    Total Rebounds per game (Career): 3.9    Assists per game (Career): 8.9    Steals per game (Career): 0.9    Blocks per game (Career): 0.2    Points per game (Career): 24.1     Does your choice still seem so obvious to you? I mean your argument is basically that Randle is less vital to the Knicks than Trae is to the Hawks, which doesn’t strike me as much of a criticism of Trae himself. If anything it’s a compliment."
"Steve Nash, Trae Young, Harden"
"I just don’t get why Trae Young isn’t in when Curry’s in. Like in the 3rd quarter: Not for defense obviously, but Trae elevates the Hawks offense and it was needed to match the momentum of Curry’s 3rd quarter. Instead, Trae and Collins on the bench as the warriors go up 20. Huerter is initiating the offense and had the ball stolen like twice. Makes no sense. Also, is it me or did Danilo Gallinari regress or is being used wrong? Couldn’t post up nor could he shoot. And Hawks fans: who’s better? Deandre hunter or Cam reddish?"
Why does Trae Young look like Count Olaf
Trae Young was a 27% 3pt shooter through 11 games.
"Most Raptor fans don’t get it either.   Overall it’s just the fact they were drafted one after the other, so the connection from the draft naturally makes people pit them against each other.   There was tons of Celtics fans that loved seeing Fultz fail in Philly. There were tons of Luka fans wishing the worst for Trae Young and the Hawks.   It happens all the time, and it honestly doesn’t make sense other than people being insecure."
"People also seem to think that unless you're a Luka/Trae/Ja caliber young guy, you can't contribute to winning."
Trae Young is nothing like Curry apart from the fact that he shoots deep threes
Trae young and Anthony Edwards.   Obviously players can turn around their shooting from their first 11 games.
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"Love the mentality. Also ton of a respect to Trae Young commanding a box-and-one but still going out there and balling.  I think with the NBA format now, with play-ins, it's easier to recover from bad starts. Moreso in NBA, where over half the teams make it into the playoffs, than in other sports. I'd say let's start judging in December but the Warriors look legit and can get better with Klay + Wiseman coming back"
Ahem… IT SMELL LIKE BITCH IN HERE   The A real quiet tonight huh? Trae young is afraid of immanuel quickley LMAOOOOOO
BING BONG  TRAE YOUNG CAN'T OUTPLAY OUR 3 STRING POINT GUARD TRAY YOUNG IS A BALDING FRAUD  BING BONG
TRAE YOUNG STILL NOT VALID IN DYCKMAN
"Say what you want about how badly we’ve played this season, but good to see our offseason changes have helped in this matchup. Despite his fuck off logo 3s, our offense all night was run directly at Trae Young. Can’t hide him on Bullock now. Huge win for us with 4 key injuries and such a tough schedule over the next couple weeks. Bing bong motherfuckers."
Player: Trae Young  Dyckman status: still not valid
Hope Trae young destroys a barbershop lmao
Trae young is a BITCH LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
"Lmao, imagine thinking that a team would give up Lillard for an athletic freak who won't dunk over fucking Trae Young"
Trae you too young to have white hairs in your beard
I can’t deal with the prospect of trae young being valid in dyckman
"The Knicks official motto is about to be ""Fuck Trae Young"""
"In the near future, Trae young will be obviously better than Lillard. He's already having a significantly better season and he's 8 years younger. Lillard is going to get worse while young gets better."
"Trae Young is, regrettably, so fucking good."
Trae Young is similar in appearance to my father's genitalia
You mean tall Trae Young????
Trae Young is not valid in Dyckman
Trae Young. Fucking killed us
"You're the same dude who said Russ is better than Trae Young right now lmao, stfu nobody should take your opinion seriously"
Oh yeah teue Ben Simmons &gt; Trae Young in that case
Iono man Trae young blocked a Ben Simmons dunk.
"It’s funny, 16+ hours into this thread and every comment I’m seeing from both sides is trae young is incredible and damn I hope Ja is alright.  Gives me hope for the community."
Well I know for a fact Schlenk says no. I’m also bettering Brad would be more than happy to unload Tatum for Trae. Trae would make the Celtics a much better team then they are now.   The league is wising up on inefficient checkers who don’t do much else. Tatum is a massive part of why the Celtics are a .500 team. He can’t facilitate and the ball dies with his iso hero ball style of play. Tatum is another example of young player who came in and played well and then got overrated
Lmao Trae Young?
"Really? Because every time some young point guard goes off for a few games we start hearing about how they're surpassing Trae. Happened Ja, happening with Lamelo now too."
"im sorry but its always gonna be luka &gt; trae... luka is fucking 6'7+ , and basically can do everything trae can do except more. i mean luka is better than trae, period lol. unless lukas stats and skills take a dive, id rather have a 6'7 trae young over the actual 6' trae young"
"Lol it's always ""insert young star name"" &gt; Luka when they're playing good. Go off bro we chillin. Just know when JT or Ja or any young star is going nuclear on the court the formula is always goung be ""one of them"" &gt; Luka. Not ""one of them"" &gt; Trae."
"Trae is clearly having a better season *so far*, but the season is still quite young"
Trae Young blocked Mo Bamba and his rim protection lead to Ben Simmons passing instead of dunking. Gotta give this one to the point goblin
"So you assume the Clippers would have won the championship had Kawhi stayed healthy, but you don’t even consider that Hawks could have won the championship if Trae stayed healthy. This in spite of Trae’s 48/7/11 game 1 on the road and the 35 he had in the 3rd quarter of game 3 before getting hurt, where the Hawks were ahead.   The simple truth of the matter was the Bucks couldn’t stop Trae Young, and the Hawks had a great chance of winning that series with him. But injuries are part of the game and the Bucks are NBA champs. However, your willingness to point out the importance of one injury while completely ignoring another, all because it’s fits your narrative about how much better a player Mr. First-Round-Exit is than Trae, requires quite a bit of mental gymnastics on your part."
"“More points than Steph” who the hell uses total points as a metric these days 😂 how disingenuous.   Steph is averaging 3 ppg more than Trae, on much better efficiency. But Trae has played 2 more games and the season is still young so he has more total points by 1 point lol."
Trae young is absolutely a superstar and no amount of impotent rage can change that at this point.
Bulls fans love to the on Trae Young without ever watching him play
Lmfao people on this sub love high volume ppg Trae Young so much
1) Giannis  2) Trae Young  3) Steph Curry  4) KD  5) Ja Morant
I’d probably just replace Trae Young with Chris Paul and maybe flip Giannis/Jokic but your list is good

Is Trae Young valid?
I can see you are a fan but he doesn't have a very nice game to watch. I don't go to YouTube looking for Trae Young highlights. If his team gets in the top 5 of the NBA then I'd imagine they would talk about the Hawks in general.
FUCK TRAE YOUNG
"As of right now, CP3 would definitely be ahead of Trae Young on the MVP list. Which was the argument, was it not?"
"They always struggle with efficiency. Dug this up from when I looked into this in the past about some guards. This was through their first 27 games, so a bigger sample of bad play and  more time for the guys I'm about to list to actually turn the corner so unfair to the current crop:  Trae Young: 16/3/7 with 4tos on atrocious 38/25/78 splits   DLo: 12/4/4 with 1.5 A:TO on 40/31/71 splits   Lonzo Ball: 9/7/7 on 33/27/49 splits   De'Aaron Fox: 10/3/4 on 41/30/68 splits   Jamal Murray: 10/3/2 on 38/36/83 splits  Throwing in some more guys now through 20 games(\~what today's rookies have played so far):  Darius Garland: 11/2/3 on 48%TS  Ant: 14/3/2 on 47%TS  One-and-Done guards are going to play horribly out the gate. We go through this cycle of being shocked every year. Stop being shocked. The guys who came out the gate notably well in the past like Luka and Ja are not only the exceptions, but also come from a different background one having played pros and other being a sophomore."
"So, it was a mix of three things, mostly, I'll list them in order that I deem importance.  1. Clint Capela was playing very bad. Like, awful. He's always been a slow starter, but he did some rehabbing over the off-season and has only just got into playing shape over the winning streak. He was bad offensively and defensively up until now.  2. Schedule. We played some very tough teams, had a west coast trip against all their best teams with multiple back to backs, all while Clint was slumping.  3. When Hunter was healthy in the starting lineup, while his on ball defense is great, he was a bit of a ball stopper, and it infected a lot of the entire starting lineup. We didn't run an offense so much as we exclusively hunted mismatches. It was pretty bad, but I list it as 3rd because due to talent our offense was still mostly fine. The bigger issue was, missed shot bled into transition points and Clint being bad defensively just exasperated the whole issue.  We're playing much better RN. Also helps Trae Young is absolutely fucking bonkers. He has a real mid range game (I think his shooting % from midrange is in the 60's rn) and his three point shot is falling due to better selection and him just being hot.  On the up swing!"
Trae young is a basketball savant
Trae Young is really good.  I wonder if he'll make an all-star game this year
Dame is barely better than Trae currently lol  He'd have to stall out at a fairly young age to only reach Dame level
Or the Mavs would sweep the Clippers with Trae Young on the team. I too can make up scenarios based on nothing whatsoever
I wish we could see trae play on the mavs…this narrative wouldn’t even exist…young would’ve been swept by the clippers both years if you replaced Luka with him on the mavs
Trae Young wasn't even all-star last year. Infact Derrick White might be better.  Keep Sleeping.
"Yeah, it’s honestly impressive. Both of them are young and getting better but just from watching them the past few years Trae is closing the gap."
Trae young is the best pure point guard in the NBA period.
Trae young giving the young man some advice! /s
"If Morey offered Simmons straight up for Wiggins today, do you think GSW will take it?  That's the question. And it wouldn't even work due to salary differences.  Wiggins might have a hard time guarding AD, but Wiggins can guard Russ + LeBron decently well. Simmons can guard all 3, but on the other end of the floor they'd just slack off him and that's not worth what Simmons brings on the other end. Wiggins might hold LBJ to 30 and put up 20 himself while spacing defenses. Simmons might hold LBH to 20 but only put up 8 points and not pull much defensive attention at all. I'd take Wiggins in that case.  FYI: Simmon's points vs Hawks: 17, 4, 18, 11, 8, 6, 5. That's 9.86 ppg... just sad considering he can dunk all over Trae Young. How you think he's going to score over anyone bigger or someone who actually is a decent defender?"
"Definitely. Look at Trae Young this season... better FG%, better 3pt%, better FT% = Lower TS% Why? His free throws have fallen by almost three attempts a game."
"-Trae Young, probably"
"Pick 5 deserves some credit:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Dwyane Wade  SF: Scottie Pippen  PF: Charles Barkley  C: Kevin Garnett  Insane defensively in today’s modern era, and Wade/Trae should provide enough offence."
Is player B Trae Young lol?
True. I may dislike him on the court but I respect him as a player. MSG ain't gonna be yelling 'fuck Trae Young' if he was a scrub.
"So you’re 12 then?  LeBron, KD, Curry, Luka, Trae, Lillard, Giannis, Harden, Jokic, Embiid, that’s 10 with Kawhi out.  AD, Booker, Beal, CP3, Paul George, Butler, Tatum, Brown, Beal, Mitchell, KAT, Gobert, Zion is out, Irving is out, and that’s the top 25.    If Ball wasn’t a terrible defender with poor scoring efficiency he’d be top 25, but he’s certainly not there now.    Young players improve quickly.  Ant’s D puts him a lot higher than he would be if he was playing defense like last year.  LaMelo needs to figure Defense out and become more efficient."
Trae Young owns us

Trae is already (in my mind) of the the young goats in Atlanta w Acuña and if he wins the ship he’d prolly be the biggest star in a city full of them
WCS is allergic to scoring the basketball. I've seen him pass up on a shot 3 feet from the basket when confronted by a 6'1 player who didn't even jump - it's like the Ben Simmons and Trae Young meme but instead it happens on every play where he's near the basket.
Oh yeah the for sure stay padding trae young&amp;chris Paul’s height. They probably aren’t 6 feet tall
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
Trae Young is absolutely not better than Tatum.
you people simply don’t watch basketball. They are worthless because 90% of the times they are easy defensive rebounds that Trae Young could pick up if he wanted
"Trae young. Hes a scrawny dude who looks like hes barely 6ft. But does shit on the court thats incredible, makes dudes that are so much taller than him look like fools"
1. Luka Doncic 2. Ja Morant 3. Trae Young 4. Zion Williamson 5. Jayson Tatum 6. Anthony Edwards 7. Lamelo Ball 8. DeAaron Fox 9. Tyler Herro 10. SGA
"Trae young should be in all these discussions honestly, he’s clearly one of the scariest offensive stars in the league"
Trae Young
Trae Young has a ridiculous level of quickness
Nets defense will be fine now that we don't have DeAndre Jordan  Trae Young &gt; Jayson Tatum
"Whole lot of people in this thread just naming short guys. Most of them were 0.0000001% athletes despite their height though, up there with anyone.  Honestly think Trae Young deserves a mention here, other than past-his-prime CP3 he’s probably the closest among current players to just being a ‘normal’ guy physically. Still extremely athletic by regular person standards but like, you wouldn’t be amazed if you met some guy at a YMCA with the same size/measurables as him or anything."
Literally none of those guys in the second group except PG have performed to expectations so far lol  Even people like Trae Young have been better
"Well I’m a homer but I think Trae takes it.  Trae is one of the leagues top 5 best playmakers while matching Ja’s scoring output. I think Trae is more technical and crafty. Don’t think defense is in the conversation for these two as well.   I will say Ja was the better point guard to start out the season though. Had a monster first few weeks while Trae was settling in. I mean, Ja is the leading scorer (last I saw) in the paint as a slashing point guard you can’t take that away from him. MVP qualities in the both of these young point guards and I’m excited to watch them flourish despite all doubts."
I feel like it’s disrespectful to Trae young to not say trae young
In alignment with my flair I can and will say Trae Young.
"It was the same with Trae and JC while we were shit last year.  If you have two young stars the media just wants to report about beef between them.  Obviously if they always throw shit at a wall, sometimes it sticks."
That was goofy…Trae Young is leaps and bounds better than him.
But I heard Trae Young and James Harden are gonna get cooked by the new rules!
Trae Young performing the best outta them so far but Luka will always have media bias on his side

"Trae Young, truly the New Hitler Youth"
Yeah but that's how developing a young player goes. Ingram averaged 9 points on like 40% shooting before he got developed into a 18 ppg guy by Lakers.  Not everyone is Trae or Luka and will instantly be stars.
"Jimmy Butler is definition of a “fake rich white girl”. Tired of of these gullible annoying cringe fanboys Defending him and thinking he is tough. How is he tough when he flops the same as Trae Young.  I’m sick of people say their tough and act like scums. Don’t want to be a baby but truth is their bullies and they deserve to be put in their place.  Real tough Guys were Rodman, Oakley, Lambert, and Artest. They never screamed, “I’m tough” like a cringe Instagram model like Butler did to a player last year LMAO.  I’ve never seen Butler be real tough other than talk shit and act annoying. Fuck Butler fuckbois and keep defending what the golden angel did to the Wolves when he disgracefully disrespect the organization but guys like KAT and Wiggins.  The fucker still hasn’t apologized btw which shows he is a grade A shitty scum. Wish Artest and Lambieer were playing in today’s league to put him in his place."
I think Donte Divincenzo has a higher NBA ceiling than Trae young.
nerf Trae Young.
"#IS TRAE YOUNG VALID???  hell yeah he is, good lord, he's crazy good. gg hawks fans, good luck with the season."
guys would u rather have derrick white or trae young
"Be honest- who would you rather have for the rest of their career, Trae Young or Derrick White? [Serious]"
Who Would you rather have Trae Young or Derrick White?
"see trae young, doncic, ja morant ,they might take hard shoots, yeah, flashy dunks(ja case), yeah, but not this kind of absurd shit with a tied game"
"That's DPOY candidate Trae Young to you, pal"
Trae Young owns the New York Knicks
Trae young with 40-5-12
You mean Trae Young who started playing off ball and became a non-factor?
"He understands it, he just doesn't want his attempts getting yammed into the 15th row by defensive dynamos like Trae Young"
lowkey Curry  like when Candace Parker predicted a 50 piece vs. Hawks cause of Trae Young comps and Curry did it
"Trae Young on the show up aspect. A lot of his passes through opponents legs, F U 3’s and his playoff shenanigans. I think he needs to keep growing as a player to really be a full on answer to this though."
He's not Trae young sorry 🤷‍♂️
"Joel ""Trae Young"" Embiid"
Are you really blaming the coach when trae young has 0 points and 4 turnovers😂
"Trae Young if he's not shooting 15 free throws a game (mostly by jumping into defenders) is a very good player, but not an MVP candidate. It'll be close but I think they'll still make it in the East."
"Trae Young, John Collins, Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter and Clint Capela for Gordon Hayward who says no here?"
Trae young is no lamelo ball that’s for sure
LaGOAT Ball is outplaying Trae Young so far. Put clamps on him too.
Hawks lost would make me happy.  Trae Young playing against his future team?
they're also not stars. come get me when harden or trae young or bron get fined for flopping
"I thought Jahlil would've been very good. Great low post game and I thought his measurements would've made him a good enough defender. He turned out to be Trae level bad at the center position lmao.  Maybe if he was drafted into a better situation, he wouldn't have lost the passion for the game and kept improving. But that's still on him. Tho he's still really young and can become a better player imo."
Trae Young is the leader of Capitol Hill’s defense team
In b4 people bring trae young into this
"Your worse then reactionary, you just shit on Luka 24/7 solely because your a Trae Young fan. That shit is so toxic"
It’s worse than flopping. I don’t like this move Trae Young is doing where he gets his defender behind him then jacks up a shot attempt so they bump into his back and it’s two free throws every time.
"Part of it is that it has never led to efficient team offense. Yes, the Bulls have awful offensive personnel, but the team's offense doesn't improve all that much when LaVine is on the floor. Compare to someone like Trae Young where Atlanta's offense improved quite a bit with him on the floor (going by 2019)"
Avg 3s Per Game:  Steph Curry - 3.6  Duncan Robinson - 3.2   Dame Lillard - 2.9  Trae Young - 2.5
Trae Young and Duncan Robinson are gonna obliterate that
"Everything is correct except the conclusion that that all leads back to Lebron lol He will be able to be on chill mode bc they’re so deep. He won’t have those typical gaudy numbers   Imo the favorite is Jokic. It sucks that Westbrook has completely watered down the triple double, but Jokic is averaging a triple double. Right now Denver is underperforming but I expect them to turn it around and once that happens Jokic will be the favorite. Followed by a Trae Young BUT Trae better cut that bullshit out with the flops or no one will vote fir him. It’s the reason Harden missed out a few years. And rightfully so"
Something something Trae Young doesn't get enough respect something something.
Some Trae Young wannabe
"I feel like there’s the wrong idea that the popular draftniks are paid and/or get their notoriety entirely from their ability to be next level nostradumses, which isn’t really the case.   Their content lies in between the lines. The articles, information hubs, arguments &amp; reasoning, writing style, and yes takes that age both well and badly are a holistic package that lead to someone like KOC gaining a following and becoming well known.   There are more underground draft guys on non-major sites or draft twitter that probably have a better  measure of hits or misses but most draft guys aren’t overly impressive at calling shots to the point that it outweighs whether or not their content is interesting/presented well. Most NBA teams aren’t either so I don’t know why your expectation would be otherwise.  If you constructed some kind of data analysis for hits &amp; misses down the line I don’t think KOC would be among the worst. I’m not sure how you would weigh that though (e.g., is putting Doncic at 1 better/worse than Trae Young at 11? Having Bagley out of the top 5? What about less noticeable calls like totally fading guys like Thon Maker who unceremoniously bust?)  It’s way too early to be making judgment calls on careers for the last 3-4 drafts. I do agree his board seemed particularly out there this year, but it was also a really, really weird year to have to analyze prospects."
"Trae Young John Collins Cameron Reddish DeAndre Hunter Onyeka Okungwu Bogdan Bogdanovic Kevin Huerter or Clint Capela  The expansion team would likely be a lap to choose a solid bet from either Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, or Rajon Rondo"
Steph Curry’s MVP run and Lamelo Ball vs Trae Young are Prime watches for me
"I’ll need some evidence. I’m not saying he doesn’t, but Lebron does that *really* often. And the way Giannis plays you’d think he deserves more free throws than Trae Young"
&amp;&amp; I’m now a Trae Young and Atlanta Hawk fan now
You should see the dirty ass muggin quickley did on young last night. Literally gave trae a reach around
"Jesus lol. There have been a ton of ""Trae Young foul seeking is bad for basketball"" lately now a player doesn't do it and its a weakness. The fact that you got upvotes for that comment...absolutely ridiculous.       Kyrie can draw fouls if he wanted to but its not a part of his game. Looks like it is a conscious decision not because he can't figure out how.       He has ultimate body control and movements and you dont think he can stop on a dime and have guys run into him if thats something he actually wants to do?"
Trae Young is now one of my favorite players. Just for that.
Lol Trae Young getting robbed in the pic
8 FTs combined. Trae Young seething rn
Trae Young says Michael Jordan couldn't wash Steve Nash's Canadian jockstrap --   ESPN
"Yeah I mean let's not kid ourselves, Trae Young was definitely influenced by Steph's deep 3s. The difference is he is way more on ball dominant and runs a lot more PnRs like Nash."
Trae Young born after Jordan's Bulls tenure
trae young is mad corny side note
"Trae Young be like ""I try to model my game after Steve Nash, and maybe a bit of Iverson cause I like scoring a lot""."
Trae young??? Really??
Mitchell is a lot shorter than he looks. Him being kinda bulky and having long ass arms kind of hides the fact he's only 6'1ish. About the same height as Trae Young.
"“No one said that Trae Young is better than Luka and Steph” - this sub already, as if everyone forgot the opening week takes already"
"Huh, I never considered how good that comparison is. Trae Young and Steve Nash.  Nash's game nowadays would probably look similar. There was an interview I remember watching where Nash was sad thinking back on how he played and wishing he shot more."
Don't bring Trae Young into this
He’s never showed out offensively. Defensively he’s a lockdown perimeter guard. Just look at what he did to Trae Young last week
"&gt; Most (maybe all)  Trae is the only scorer in the top 10 atm to whom this applies. As for the rest of your comment, I’m aware trae is good, especially for such a young star, I definitely didn’t say otherwise."
"If Trae Young thinks Steve Nash is the greatest ever, that explains his defense."
WTF..I love Trae Young now?

Trae Young so good at copying. Even copied Nash's defense.
Crazy that Steve Nash in the middle of coaching a game against Trae Young said something to the refs to try to influence them in calling the game more favorably towards his own team.
"Ben Simmons - 13.3, 9.9, 7.0...Non existant outside shot  Kyle Lowry - 18.7, 4.5, 7.7... Barely cracking 40% from the field, team is an abysmal 1-5.  Trae Young - 28.6, 4.1, 9.1...Averaging 3 FTA'S more per game this season and still isn't averaging his most PPG. shooting 33% from 3, and flops his way to the free throw line  Malcom Brogdon - 22.0, 4.4, 7.7... Leads Indiana in PPG. Team is top 3 in FG% thanks to his 47% FG, has increased his PPG from last year by nearly 6.0ppg, was the biggest reason the Pacers went 45-28 last season without Oladipo.   Better scorer than Simmons and Lowry.   Averages the same amount of rebounds as Young and Lowry  Averages the same amount of assists as Simmons and Lowry.   Has a better record than every other player. Quite arguable. If you're not a moron."
"Exactly. Also Trae Young didn’t come out and say “I change my mind Jordan is the goat”, he said something along the lines of “I feel like this documentary may change my mind” or something"
"&gt;“the best player of all time is [...] my favorite player""  Trae Young with the r/nba level logic"
&gt; It’s different if Rivers didn’t slow down at all and bulldozed Trae.   Like when Grayson Allen blew by Trae Young and he did exactly that?
"This isn't directed at your comment at all but I get a little annoyed how some on social media want to make it about who's better, Curry or Dame.   They are both elite talents and two of the best point guards today. There are some really great point guards in this league, CPIII is still great even if he's showing his age, Ja Morant a great guard of the future, Jamal Murray growing into a perennial all star, Westbrook still elite, Kyrie Irving still dances with the ball on string, De'Aaron is likely De'Fastest guard in the league today, Trae Young is looking like a really special talent, I enjoy watching these guys do the things they do on a basketball court."
"Right so no evidence? And then just blame it on something.   Maybe don’t make stupid claims then.  My only claims have been KD and Harden &gt; Curry. That’s not hating, those are two of the greatest offensive players to have ever played.   Hating would be what a lot of Atlanta flairs did and say Trae Young &gt; Curry."
"Look Harden has done some pretty ridiculous stuff, I am biased but personally I dont think what he does now is nearly as egregious as this Trae Young shit."
"I think they’d rather keep those u listed because of their fit around trae young, and they just drafted onyeka okungwu, plus they will need to extend trae and possibly Kevin huerter. Yes I’d rather keep Collins over caplea but they like the pick and role with him and trae. And Collins wants a max and he’s def not worth it yet. Would u rather have a massive overpay or those three to add depth to a contender?"
"I'm a Hawks fan and I think now would be a solid time to jump on board.  Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Hunter -- they have a solid young core and hopefully can draw some free agents in the coming years."
Trae Young is the most annoying player in the NBA
Great job by him.   With the Trae Young stuff recently what is the difference in this play being an offensive foul vs a defensive foul on TJ?
The fact that he made 7 or he the fact that he only took 9 and if this was Trae Young it be like 15.
&gt;Trae Young getting sonned by his dad Immanuel  my god this sub
"They are moulding and preparing Harden's replacement. Apparently the refs are disappointed in Harden and how many fake fouls he draws, he is apparently drawing too less fouls. So the refs are taking on Trae and teaching him, encouraging him in the art right from a young age."
Is James Harden the old Trae Young?
Steph is more of a bulldozer than Trae Young
"i’m a little confused, do you mean title should be called “Trae Young the next James Harden”  Steph will never try to accomodate this tactics, because he’s not a bulldozer to do that consistently without injuries"
"In a league where defending Trae Young without fouling him is nigh impossible, this was such a sick stop. It looked like Trae fully beat him when he just got fucking robbed lmao. IQ already a fan favorite."
"I absolutely think Trae took what he’s doing from Harden, but ultimately I don’t think it’ll be the same level of revolution as Steph. I think what Steph did was cool and fun and something young kids want to do, and what Trae/Harden are doing is too frowned upon and generally not fun to replicate. Too many people won’t teach or try that because as Nash said “that’s not basketball.”"
"Empty stats are when someone is putting up shiny box score stats, but is highly inefficient. Examples are Tony Wroten, Jerry Stackhouse, MCW (rookie season), etc.  The “empty stats” narrative is by far the most lazy accusation in bball. Devin Booker, AD, and Trae Young were all accused of it simply because of their team’s record."
"Defenses are way more passive now and that's impossible to argue, defensive schemes are more complex to try to outweigh that, but still doesn't work because the worst offenses are averaging 100-105 points.  Defensive players have zero room to work with in the NBA nowadays the same way they don't have it in the NFL. Players are playing at the 1980s pace of play without the 1980s handcheck and physicality.  In the NFL people can understand that you can't compare John Elway's stats with QBs today because the game is completely different, it's a different sport, but in the NBA we don't have that as much.  The impact of great defensive play is far reduced simply because there's only so much you can do. If you were able to clone 1988 Michael Jordan into today's game he would either average 45 ppg because nobody would be able to guard him without centers and without touching him OR he would foul out within 15 minutes on defense because of today's style of defenses.  Back in the day you would put you best defender on their best offensive player and he would have a shot, nowadays Gary Payton wouldn't be able to guard Trae Young because he would foul out. Defenses are being limited and that just sucks to watch.  Ray Lewis talks the same when it relates to the NFL and other former all-time great defenders have said so for the NBA. You need a minimum level of physical play in the game or it's just not basketball anymore."
"There's a lot of nostalgia for a style of basketball that actually allowed defenders to play and if someone pulled what Trae Young is pulling right now, they would get thrown in to the ground. The reason offense is more valuable right now is because defenders literally can't play the game, you can't handcheck or hard press someone or they foul bait and you are gone in 15 minutes.  Defenses today have more complex schemes than they did 20 years ago, but the impact that a individual can have is far reduced, simply because you can't touch people.   We are at 1980s pace of play without the 1980s handchecking and physical style of play, that's why you see the worst offenses in the league AVERAGING 100 points.  Offensive players have to much freedom and defensive players can't do anything to stop it, that's all."
"It bothered me how many people seemed to be wrong about this, so I researched it by searching “fouls drawn by T. Young” in each games play by play. I stand corrected, Trae drew the most fouls he’s drawn this season yesterday. I guess with the officiating being so bad against our defense, it felt like Trae wasn’t under a spotlight for drawing fouls. I stand corrected. [Here’s what I found.](https://i.imgur.com/ZKuvkY6.jpg)"
"How is that any different from watching a team shoot 14-42 from 3 and still be ""efficient"" because three's are just ridiculously valuable?  Foul baiting and three pointers are too good and efficient, that's why players like Trae Young and James Harden who are below average/average three point shooters and shoot 44% from the field are considered ""efficient scorers"".  Trae Young AVERAGES 12 FTA per game as a shooter/perimeter player who shoots mostly three's, shit like that wouldn't fly in the 1990s and 2000s. When you can't physically punish someone for doing something like that because the rules don't allow you to, players will just abuse it.  People think about the Golden State Warriors ball movement with Steph, Klay and Draymond and think that's what basketball nowadays is, when in reality it's just a bunch of teams shooting 40-45 threes a game, missing 70% of it and still getting 110 points through fouls and 3s.  Back in 2001 if a team got 100 points it's because they couldn't miss, last night the Hawks got 108 by shooting 10-31 from 3 and a bunch of FTs from Trae.  To sum it up, foul baiting is at its apex because people can't get punished by other players by it, 3s are too valuable and scoring is through the roof due to pace. We are at the same pace the league had in the 1980s, but without any of the physicality and the handchecking."
"i dont understand how you can look at the two guys and be like, yup it's a close call. what is trae young better at than luka? slightly better 3 point percentage? does that even matter when luka is hitting game winning stepback threes in the playoffs?"
"""Trae Young. I'm starting to despise that man."" - Arthas Menethil"
"I got downvotes a week ago for saying it. The ""Trae Young is the next Steph"" crowd love his antics. I, for one, do not see the appeal."
"Trae Young is a bitch who isctoo worried about what's happening behind him, he manipulates the game in a way where's it's impossible to defend in a legitimate manner.  Translate that to driving a vehicle on the interstate and one vehicle slams on their breaks at 80mph, a short distance directly ahead of you-it is really your fault you didn't have time to break and avoid collision??   Young is a bitch."

"That's what makes Trae's FTA so crazy. A guy like Embiid gets a lot of those Shaq calls where he's just too big and agile to stop without fouling him, even when defended by other centers. He also baits quite a lot of fouls, and flops here and there.  Despite all of that, Trae Young is averaging 3FTA/game more than him."
*Blows whistle*   Trae  Young will shoot another free 50 free throws.
Trae young is such a puss
"Fuck Trae Young, all my homies hate Trae Young"
"Eh, it bugs me when he is really blatant about it, but I guess if everyone else is doing it, why wouldn’t you? Luka and Trae and all the young stars have been watching the last generation of stars turn it into a crucial part of scoring, so of course they’re gonna do it, too.  My only issue with Trae is his stans that have become pretty insufferable after the start of this season. I actually like Trae and him and Luka seem cool with each other (Ayton, too). Luka has horrible stans, too, but they’re way more active on our sub than they are on r/nba. So when I’m on r/Mavericks I fucking hate Luka stans, and when I’m here I fucking hate Trae stans. There’s nowhere left to go."
"I'm gonna shit on this guy /u/greenrvnger until he STFU about Curry. Look what he said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kozj3n/the_warriors_are_spending_824_million_including/ghuzhp4/):   &gt;I’ve said it from the start that this year will prove to a lot of people that Curry isn’t the top 5 player people make him out to be. He can’t carry a team. He thrives when the team is built around him but when it’s him and scrubs, he’s just an older, more injury prone Trae Young"
"I’m all for free throws it’s part of the game. If a defender legitimately fouls you it’s honestly fine as it rewards aggression and offensive prowess.   But when guys are going to the free throw line 15 times a game and 90% of them are fouls that are either like this or flailing around the 3PT line it kills the game flow and the court looks like a fucking circus act with players, coaches, and “fans” throwing their hands up in disgust and arguing every call.  I’m literally watching a 3 hour basketball game and 75% of Atlanta’s offensive possessions are Trae Young trying to draw fouls before he even gets to the elbow, then watch him shoot free throws, and rinse and repeat."
Payback. God I fucking hate Trae Young.
Why does trae young already get that superstar ft treatmeant
Trae Young is boring to watch. The foul baiting is horrible.
trae young is based?
"Lowry averages 3.9 FTA/G (free throw attempts per game) over the past 3 years, Trae Young is averaging 12 FTA/G this year and had 9.3 last year. Trae is on a different level"
I love Trae young but this is annoying asf. Especially when there is inconsistency on which players get the calls.
"Yeah the fact that trae gets more calls than Giannis is absolutely insane.  It makes sense you would have to foul to stop a 7 foot freak athlete, but I don't buy it when it's 130 lb Trae Young"
"Harden is one of the best players in the league, but he's also annoying as shit to watch a lot of the time.  Trae Young is going to get a ton of hate because he's super young, hasn't really established himself as a top player, and still did this bullshit."
"Seth's brother Steph on golden state has really impressed me. I know he has a few awards and has been part of a championship team before, but that veteran presence he brings is impactful to the young guys like wiseman.  You can really see the leadership on the court this year, I'm really happy he's bouncing back after averaging horrible stats last year.  He's definitely on track to be the Trae Young of the Western conference."
How can Trae Young get ‘superstar calls’ when he’s not a Superstar?
Curry with the classic Trae Young move.
DAE TRAE YOUNG BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE
"Trae ""James Harden"" Young"
Trae Young is what Julian Newman would’ve been if he was good
Trae Young looking like a real baby back bitch out there. Least aesthetically pleasing offensive game in the league right now.
Yo fuck trae young.  Dude flops like harden on pcp.
"technical foul. being within 5 feet of Trae Young. 3 Free Throws, and Bruno Fernandez gets a penalty kick"
The stats you shared are even more skewed tho. The first link had kyrie Irving number one because he scored the most even though he shot horrible from the field at 35%. Than trae young 4th in the exact same situation as kyrie. Then just look at the rest of the no names that make up the rest of the top 5. And then the second link you shared has embiid at three games. Not saying he isn’t clutch but those rankings are garbage.
If the only comparison is the arguable goat then I think saying “I’ve seen guys like rose before” is a bit misleading.   Other guys aren’t quite as good as Steph but Lillard is pretty similar from a shooting perspective. Even Trae young is similar. And I already said Klay can get just as hot without quite the distance.   They are both freakishly unique. I just think it’s a disservice to Rose to say he’s not. Because his MVP season was one of the most exciting ever. Curry is obviously a better overall player.
"&gt;Travis Schlenk drafted an All-Star in Trae Young, but whether that was a good or bad decision is still up for debate.  yeah man for sure he had 2 bad games for the first time in 2 years who knows if it was good to get him"

Trae Young hair is just to thin man.  Loc gotta buzz it.
trae young hurt me because he is only a couple of years older than me and he grew up watching him just like I did and kobe was his idol just like he was for me.
"I think that the ""record"" argument is kind of defeated by the fact that Trae Young made the all-star game last year, and the Hawks had a very bad record. Additionally, even though basketball is a game driven by stars, there's only so much one player can do. Beal has also stepped up with his defense this year"
Slow motion smooth jazz lanky Trae Young lookin’ a$$. LOL.
"Uh..... No. Not yet, probably not ever. Maxey is having a great stretch and I think he'll do very well, but better than Trae Young would be just about maxing his potential in every way."
"The backcourt is significantly better than their reputation though - CJ is definitely below average (though partially just due to being undersized playing the 2), and Dame is average-slightly below average, but neither are sieves  Kanter is trae young bad, and Nurkic hasn't looked himself at all. Dude used to be a top tier elite defender, but he's been horrible this season"
"Hmm. If we’re truly saying like no defense at all, that’s hard to find. People like Luka had atleast an inkling of defense within them.  But:  Trae Young/Devin Booker/Andrew Wiggins/Kevin Love/Thomas Bryant"
"If Trae Young stops drawing fouls the way he does now, he'll just start doing this to shoot free throws again."
who’s Harden’s basketball idol growing up? gonna need him to pull a Steve Nash on Trae Young moment
Wasn’t Trae Young also a starter for All Star too?
I’m going on what Steve Nash just told the trae young. That’s not basketball
"i hate james hardens play style jesus christ, almost as bad as trae young"
Kemba is not a good defender but he's not one of the worst defenders in the entire league like Trae Young is
"For a superstar, defense doesn't matter that much.* Offense matters significantly more. For a role player, defense matters more than offense. If you're role player is a superstar on defense and you end up paying him a max, you're essentially paying an overpaying role player.  *Superstars have to hit a minimum level of defense though. Can't be Trae Young or Bradley Beal."
"There’s 13-14 calls a game in football. And I guess you’d add in non calls. So many more in the nba, and nba fouls are more subjective calls. Holding can be called every play, yes, but how many holding penalties are there a game? And they don’t lead as directly to points.  I have no problem arguing but I think my opinion still stands lol.  Just recently I watched trae young...he knew his team was in the bonus so he snuck up behind Levert and then with a little contact he drew an offensive foul before the nets got to inbound the ball...anything to get to the line."
Trae young jumping backwards into people
theres a difference between shaq/lebron (or giannis) lowering their shoulder and a ref having to decide whether that is a foul or just allowable contact and harden or trae young or lou williams or dame playing the game with the intention of running into people or hooking them to get fouls
"Wow, so the comparisons are true when people think Trae Young is actually the next Steph Curry!"
"🤡  The only clearly better PG's are Dame,Steph,Dončić,Ben Simmons,Kyrie and Trae Young. D'lo is in that Lowry,Kemba tier and you can rate them however you want"
Trae Young might make a couple all-star appearances. That's about it. Luka will always be in the top 5 for MVP talks and will actually lead his team to the playoffs. Just want to correct people like you.
"This makes the nba much less interesting to watch imo. So dictated by refs. The refs get played so easily, it’s like they don’t watch what actually occurs but just see silhouettes of players. Trae Young is another dude that does this, I’d rather watch players who want to score more than go to the line."
What pissed me off about the Beal snub was that Trae Young made an all star team. A player with worse stats on a worse team.
https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/top-10-point-guards-nba-right-now https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29016357/luka-doncic-ja-morant-zion-williamson-trae-young-which-young-star-nba-execs-build-around
I was told Trae Young is better than Lebron
Trae Young wouldn't have missed those open 3s
I'll chime in. For Harden it doesn't help him because he's going for a ring and that won't work in the playoffs.   For Trae and Luka they are young and still learning the game and how to find an advantage. Lukas more in the Gianni's range where he also should search for it. Trae needs to use it because he needs it to even get his team to the playoffs.  Lebron doesn't but needs too more because he gets no call at all.
NASH GAVE TRAE YOUNG DEPRESSION
“Oh shit they’re calling me Ice Trae? Better miss this shot.” - Trae Young
"Yeah I've only seen a handful of wizards games but in every game I've ever watched Beal is consistently the worst on-ball defender on the floor. In the BOS game Brown and Tatum sought him out as if his last name was Kanter and they were getting paid by Erdogan and blew by him every single time.   Not to mention he's statistically bottom 5 in EVERY category for his position, and cumulatively bottom 2 behind Trae Young. None of that implies good on ball defender."
"yeah lamelo ball also outplayed trae young, what's your point."
"I dunno. Maybe it’s because I’m an older dude, but I still play basketball and these young guys now like to randomly jack up 35 footers because that’s what guys in the league do now.  They even make them sometimes but it pisses me off even time they shoot those shots.   I know they’re not Trae Young but I’m imagining John Collins running down the floor and trying to run a set but watching some ridiculous attempt like it’s a game of horse.  Maybe John Collins is old at heart like me"
I'm hearing Trae Young is practicing social distancing
I would rather never watch basketball again than watch/root for the Knicks franchise tbh.   Imagine having the largest market value as a basketball franchise and being a perennial poverty team. Y’all would KILL to have Trae Young he’d be your best PG of all time lmao
Depends but 7/10 times I’m taking Pascal. Watching Collins play most of his points seem to come off of the gravity Trae Young creates. Don’t see much of him getting his own. Pascal has shown that (although I wouldn’t want him to be my number 1 option) and is also a much better defensive player
"Agreed but I think it has to stop being about creating for Trae more and start being about running an actual offense. Lloyd tried to sell everyone on a ball movement offense and it has been anything but into his third season.  You have lots of good or young players with talent. Use and develop them. Part of Trae's development has to be running a real offense, looking to disrupt FOR others vs himself all of the time (his assists are misleading), and moving without the basketball. He doesn't do any of that well but we want to treat him like a God. That's reserved for Luka. For the record, I'm not sad when I watch Luka anymore. Atlanta didn't deserve him. Hes like Nash - he elevated everyone around him. No one would say that about Trae"
NBA would be dead in 10 years if Nash encouraged the younger generation to foul bait like Trae Young.
"There’s probably thousands of these sort of disagreements throughout one basketball season for the entire league. I would say it’s pretty natural for this type of disagreement to happen if you put some of the most competitive athletes in the world together at 22 and 23 years old and tell them to figure it out. The media just takes a few words and blows them way out of proportion in conjunction with what we see on the outside to get their clicks. If r/NBA had their way, Collins would’ve been traded to the Knicks and Trae would’ve been sent to the g league after his first summer league. Young teams need time to grow and the media just wants to make money."
"I never understand how stuff like this gets upvoted. It's just factually wrong on every single level. The Hawks record is significantly better when Young is getting to the line consistently, and has been every year he's been in the league.   2020-201:  Trae Young in ATL Wins: 12.5 FTA per game  Trae Young in ATL Losses: 8.6 FTA per game  2019-2020:  Trae Young in ATL Wins: 10.3 FTA per game  Trae Young in ATL Losses: 8.9 FTA per game  2018-2019:  Trae Young in ATL wins: 5.9 FTA per game  Trae Young in ATL losses: 4.7 FTA per game"
"sorry you’re the Trae Young guy, my bad  i get my stans mixed up"
Trae Young about to look into his crystal ball and adapt his playstyle to compensate for his 2029 NBA Finals loss
"Definitely an interesting question. McCollum looks freaking awesome this season, but Young has the higher ceiling. CJ is currently out scoring Dame, I really don’t see that being the case at the end of the season. Maybe sell CJ high and buy Trae low at this point just based on value"
"Question, based on their performances so far, who would you pick in Fantasy: CJ McCollum or Trae Young?"
"This narrative is so old and untrue its crazy that people still spew this without even knowing what they are talking about.  Bobby Knight literally called Michael Jordan the greatest player of all time in 1984 and Larry Bird called him God in 1986, yet people love to say nobody considered MJ anything before he won.  Winning has absolutely nothing to do with it, if you are the best player in the league by a mile, but your team is trash, people still will call you the best. MJ's team won 40 games in his third year and people still thought he was robbed of MVP because he averaged 37/5/4.   People don't care about Trae Young because he is AT BEST the 20th best player in the game, it has nothing to do with winning."
"People not wanting to play with Trae dates back to high school. UK was recruiting him, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Quade Green. But backed off Young late because other recruits didn’t want to play with him and they all wanted to play with Quade and Shai. All of this was from rumors, but they were definitely talked about a lot at the time. Trae’s dad even said if Quade didn’t commit to UK first Trae was going to."
Well that stopped about as fast as trae young. Thank god.
"I really like Trae Young's style. Also, the NBA oldheads can be very protective of their own way of playing. For instance, what happened when Young nutmegged Trevor Ariza."
Imagine how many free throws Trae Young would have got on 30+ shot attempts.
"I gotta imagine that's not that unusual. All the rap artists who had to hear the 90s rappers call their music ""noise"". All the rock artists who had to listen to Keith Richard's constant bitching. Guys like Steph had to hear guys like Barkley call their game a fluke all the way up until they won a chip. Guys like Kareem had to hear Wilt bitch up and down.    If im trae young reading that comment, I would say to myself, ""maybe if you knew real basketball you would have averaged more than 14 ppg on your career, Steve """
"You have to understand how building a team works. Atlanta was on the right track before he started playing like this, Trae young has so much talent and his teammates are pretty good as well. They have all the pieces to be a good team so I don’t see why you think they’ll be in the lottery if he plays the way the game should be played."
I would rather watch Elfrid Payton play into his 50s than watch/root for Trae Young
The Trae Young special
"So every player plays like Lebron, Trae Young is basically Lebron bullying people in the paint . Seems logic is not your forte"
Trae Young &gt; Luka btw!!!!!!!!!!
You didnt hear? Let me find a link.  [here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense)
"Trae young is struggling, especially from deep."
Trae Young is one of the worst defenders in the league.
"I’ll never lose the image of Trae Young playing in Portland and hitting a three a few feet behind the arch, then turning and putting a finger in front of his mouth to shush the crowd in the third or fourth quarter, but then the Hawks went on to lose by 20.   In all fairness, the Blazers Hawks are dead even in all time matchups at 58-58. Though they’ve only won once against Portland since Trae was drafted but I won’t hold on to that because they’ve got an overall losing record since he was drafted (largely due to a generally young team, not just one guy)."

"Trae put up empty stats last year. He was the only player in his team. Ball always was on his hands so it’s easy to put up that kind of stats but it didn’t lead them to anywhere. He has the help this season, but now he doesn’t even put up empty stats lol, he’s straight ass even when he has good teammates. (and Luka is literally better at everything than trash ass young other than 3pt shooting and even at the 3 point shooting trash ass young is averaging %28😭😭😭)"
"lmao trae had a really bad concussion before that he was droppign statlines that luka never will cause he aint tha type of shooter. luka is the next coming of darko milcic, trae is the next coming of steph of greatness. of everything thats good in this world down to the honeybees and trees. stop talking so much kid and just take a stepback and take a breath of the flowers. thats trae young, luka is the musk of capitalism, the stench oozing over every one of us, every day of our lives."
"That's still one of the worst, most hideously awful takes I've seen on this sub and that's saying something. They were being serious about it too! Trae Young, better than fucking Steph Curry LOL"
Trae Young was drafted 5th and traded to the Hawks. Hasn’t ever been cut
"Trae young also said before he modeling his game after Steve Nash. Steve Nash is his idol, growing up he looks up to Nash. Steve Nash disapproval of Trae's game broke him mentally.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/trae-young-model-game-steve-nash-steph-curry/"
"I wasn't sure either so I googled ""trae young Steve Nash"" and saw that Nash was complaining to the refs in a game about how Trae was drawing fouls. Nash said ""that's not basketball"" or something. Not sure if there's more to it than that tho"
"Trae Young shot 47% from 3 on catch and shoot opportunities last year. If we switched out Duncan Robinson on the heat with Young and told them to run the Duncan Robinson offence for Trae Young, he’d average a lot less points but would easily clear 40% on his 3PT%. Would you consider him an elite shooter then?  I think you’re looking too much at the % results. Look at Luka for instance. Is he a bad shooter? or does he has poor shot selection? or is he getting crowded a lot more? Or is he taking more difficult threes than a Kyle Korver is? They don’t have to mean the same thing.  A sidestep 3 may not be as efficient as a catch and shoot 3 coming off a screen, but the former is a whole lot harder to stop."
"Your man trae young head butts defenders while stepping backwards into the defender but your nit picking one of our ROLE players? Come on man, you have fucking rajon rondo the spit king too. Don't throw rocks if you live in a glass House my dude."
"You're literally fucking blind if you think Booker and Trae fucking Young get double teamed more than Curry lmfao...  But that's not a surprise considering you're the same dude that said ""Trae has elite shooting just like Harden except Harden has bad percentages""  Bruh, I hate Harden but gtfo"
Yeah sure. He's throwing. Only logical explanation. Trae Young couldn't possibly have a bad game organically. Its literally impossible
"can you atleast recall two plays in which Trae Young was scored on by Lamelo, he only scored like 9 baskets so just a general time and description would be fine"
You think Lamelo has a lot more potential than Trae Young after 10 games?
"Trae young has hit the wall known as teams actually taking you seriously. This happened recently with Jason tatum in his second year where he managed to adapt his game and become an all-star caliber player. A slight difference is that the hawks second player doesn't seem to like trae young that much and apparently trae is bad at taking criticism. I'm sure trae will go back to normal number as he adapts to teams actually considering the hawks but this slump has highlight some of his issues. He is atrocious at defense attacking trae or the weak side with Trae involve seems to be a guaranteed bucket a lot of the time. His while passes should have decrease a little as he is a third year player but tougher defense are going to force him to do so but a bigger issue is his size, he struggles against double teams that are longer than him which amounts to most of the good teams in the league it's hard to pass when you are in the land of the giants and that's something I can't see any great solution as trae is not the athlete some of the guys on the shorter side like him are. And that's my assessment after checking some hawk games if anyone thinks I'm wrong I'm open to criticism"
"It's trae young, it was easy"
Trey Burke &gt; Trae Young
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
Trae Young you dumbass
"He hasn’t been given the full reign of the offense, especially coming off the bench. Melo has had to work for his touches. His first few games he was playing 15 minutes, but when he was in there it was night &amp; day how much better the offense ran which forced Borrego to give him more touches so they could be competent running bench units.   Not all rookies need full reign of the offense to be able to improve &amp; as we see with Trae Young, gifting touches to a rookie even when great can harm their development when it’s time to start winning.   There is no doubt in my mind that Melo could fit into Kerr’s system. The kid is a savant and looks like he belongs out there. Don’t discount what bbiq and playmaking can do for a player &amp; a team."
"It’s a slump, but an article from the athletic the other day is getting very overblown. JC and Trae don’t hate each other, half the team is hurt and the offense is slumping. It’s early season growing pains on a young team with a lot of roster turnover"
These 19 shots is not the shots he used to take.   These recent 2 games against Charlotte is NOT the Trae Young we are watching for the last 2 seasons.  It all started after the film session against NYK. He was still the Trae Young we all know on that game.   Right now he is actively suppressing his game
"Remember when Trae had like 4 straight good games and we hailed him as better than Luka, the next superstar, the replacement of Curry, etc, etc? And now Trae sucks again?  Yeah, as an impartial bystander who doesn't really care who turns out better amongst all these young players, I can't wait to watch the circlejerk swing back when Melo has a few bad games"
"Regardless of offense, I just hate watching our young, talented wings and JC making so many great plays on defense and him just wasting it by just letting his man pass right through like osmosis no matter what point of the shot clock it’s on and no matter who’s guarding him.   Lamelo would have had 10 points today if Trae didn’t play"
well it’s pretty obvious whatever they are doing now is way worse than a trae young led offense
Can’t wait for the Trae Young Hype train to arrive. All last year I said no one wants to play with someone who plays like he does.  In the NBA or at the YMCA.  The fanboys said all his teammates love him.
"Trae Young used up all the young PG foul calls, none left for any of the other guys unfortunately."
I was told Trae Young is a better GOAT then Tom Brady.
Trae Young reliant on Free Throws? Next on Undisputed!!!  For real I wouldn’t overreact because the Hawks played bad in general but it is concerning how inefficient Trae is playing recently.
I was told Trae Young is better than MJ
I was told Trae Young was better than Steph Curry
Immanuel Quickley really broke Trae Young
I was told Trae Young was better than Luka Doncic.      Your apology needs to be as loud as your disrespect was.
trae young is booty
"*WHISTLE* being mean to Trae Young.. that’s a double technical foul. Trae gets 2 shots, the ball, and Bruno Fernandez gets a penalty kick"
Is LaMelo Ball already a better prospect than Trae Young?
Better than trae young tbh
Ok but can somebody post the highlight of him big dicking Trae Young that shit was so funny
"Is trae young being sluggish again tonight? Don’t have the game on, just looking at the box score"
I’d say hawks. With trae dropping long shots and capela balling out. It’s a great young team to start with imo.
"Barely. You look at people saying things at a bottom of threads with lower upvote percentage.  Trae has specific articles dropped about him saying he’s not a good shooter, just shoots a lot. Exactly what Luka does too.  Talked about foul baiting, which Luka does too.  What’s interesting is not how they perform. Players can be criticised. It’s the reaction to how they perform. Luka when not shooting well decides to look for fouls to help his team win. Great, crafty, future winnner  , takes hard shots so it’s understandable - he needs to take them as a young player etc.   Exact same for Trae, bad shooting night. Looks for other ways to help team win/fouls. Becomes anti-basketball, have you seen his Instagram. Egotistical or arrogant to take such difficult shots. Thinks he’s Curry. Bad teammate.   Criticising performance is one thing. Everyone has haters. But what I find srrange is when bad performances happen - people criticise players character and personality. Happens to Young, Harden and does not happen to Luka"
Steve Nash destroys Trae Young with facts and logic
"I agree they’re fire but I think Trae-Collins-Hunter-Reddish-Okongwu has to be close (at least in terms of potential, plus Capela is still young)"
Man Capela is the real deal. Looks like we’ve found the center to pair with Trae Young. Guess John Collins will have to sign somewhere else in the postseason huh??? Maybe San Antonio??? Please???!
Woods a project for sure but on a bad team with no stars id much rather have wood and his offensive upside.  Capela is great at what he does and earned his contact but we know what he is. He’s perfect for trae young or other star guards.
I’m 6’1 and stood next to Trae Young he’s not 6’1 man
"Well, in his last healthy game, he definitely locked down Trae Young in a win over ATL, holding him to a season-low. But that is admittedly bittersweet."
"Trae ""average shooter"" Young"
"Then it's off to hang with Trae Young and them bois  Clint Capela is on absolute fire, troubled waters ahead for the Nets"
I will never feel insulted by someone who Unironically thinks Derrick White is anywhere close to as good as Trae Young. It’s like being insulted in CSGO by a 8 year old
Trae Young has replaced Steve Nash as his idol with Trae Young
"Trae Young can only score with free throws, yes. It's not like there's an entire fucking year's worth of sample size of him hitting extremely difficult shots and getting easy floaters.   This sub will die on the hill of calling a player trash without having watched a single game of that player."
"??? BY DOING WHAT LMAO  im sorry. I love john. i really do, his defense this season with Capela is legitamitely very good. he absolutely deserves more looks on offense, some games he just doesnt get the ball nearly enough.  but?????? a vast, vast majority of his offense is finishing plays. he's not a guy that creates for himself beside the occasional midrange faceup.  breh was put in alcatraz tonight by naz reid  acting like Trae young isn't a massive reason why he became a 20/10 guy/will make $100m+ is just silly.  like dont get me wrong, wherever JC ends up next season (most likely atlanta, get ur goddamn grubby hands off spurs fan), they're going to need an elite P&amp;R guard/system to make the contract worth it"
When Clint Capela and Trae Young play good: I'm happy
Not sure if Trae Young and Clint Capela or Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo
"Man, it wasn’t the reason for the outcome, but the refs were letting some pretty egregious contact go uncalled all game long (aside from Trae Young and D’Lo’s foul drawing antics of course)."
#Clint Capela  #Trae Young
"Joel ""James ""Trae Young"" Harden"" Embiid"
"Joel ""James ""Trae Young"" Harden"" Embiid"
He remembered second half of the last game that he’s Trae Young.   He’s going nuclear tonight and just hit 40.
Rayford Trae Young is very good at basketball.
i only watch Steve Nash highlights on YouTube so I can get my share of real basketball. On my off days I watch Trae Young play some sport that's not basketball
I’m back - Trae Young
2019-2020 Trae Young is back.
Let's just ignore trae young
"Not really. Nephews in our sub keep pretending like Matt Thomas is Steph Curry and Malachi Flynn is Trae Young and Nurse is throwing games by not putting them in, but the reality is that this roster just has very little to actually work with."
"Guys like Steph Curry, Trae Young are good but they’re still cheap imitations of their hero LMA"
“Tremendous job “ after Kemba pulls a Trae Young lol  At least he finished
"Gasol's defensive IQ and his passing are absolutely every bit as advertised. Him and Schroder were (understandably) the most heralded pickups for the Lakers.  That said, I honestly think Harrell has been the best of the 3 big additions thus far. Harrell's offensive game is fitting in perfectly around the shooting role players/Bron+AD. He's been absolutely abusing slow-footed centers and his hustle is incessant. His ability to isolate and actually create his own shot was something the Lakers were clearly missing last year at the Center position. Plus, he's clearly added a serviceable midrange jumper to his game, and while he doesn't take many, it makes him all the harder to guard. But most importantly, he isn't turning out to be the massive defensive liability he was pegged as. He's not some elite rim protector, but he's also not the center equivalent of Trae Young either."
"How about what Steve Nash said to Trae Young? He’s an OG Legend and a coach, but still trashed this kid who idolizes him."
"He’s not one but he could be. He’s only in his fourth season and young players are capable of becoming more consistent.   Would easily say the same for Trae Young. I know his cold streak is all that people care about right now, but he’s only his third season as well."
OP just suggested Trae Young and Brandon Jennings are in the same tier. lol yikes
"&gt; That's not superstar material, that's Trae Young/Brandon Jennings   Trae Young is 22 and you're already writing him off as a Brandon Jennings lmao fuck dude."
Somehow r/nba will blame Trae Young for this
*Trae Young has entered the chat*
"Sir, I don't think you understand. This is an elite defensive team led by GOAT perimeter defender Trae Young"
"Ahh yes, Shaq would be no match for ... Trae Young. If Trae Young pulled that flopping shit, the next time he went to the basket, Shaq would introduce him to a real foul and Trae wouldn't come within 20 feet of the hoop for the remainder of the game."
Hawks defense is Top Ten in PPG and 2nd in FG%. But continue to go on about how You can’t build a good defense around Trae Young 🙂
I mean Trae's the most controversial player in the league. It is easy karma because you got insecure hawks fans flocking to threads like these to counter the dumbass statements that come out of people who don't watch Trae Young and just say some random narrative they heard of of Bill simmons's podcast or some shit and then you got the dumbasses who spit out those narratives.
Feels like everyday there's a negative post about trae young on this sub
“I’ll take Trae Young over Steph” is a legit comment I saw on this sub when the Hawks were on their little streak lol.
Ain’t y’all the same ones that were calling Trae young mvp and constantly defending his foul baiting?
CP3 and Trae Young are not 6ft
"Sincerely this time he didn't talked too much shit (usually he is just trash like many others). Donovan is on a lower tier than other young upcoming superstars, like Luka, Trae, Tatum... he is still good, but probably would never be an MVP caliber player."
"""Trae Young MVP"" after 3/4 games"
"You are correct. At this point, Trae Young is a volume shooter, not a great shooter.  36% in 3pt percentage college, 34% in the NBA.   People think he is better than he is because of his volume and that he shoots from 10 feet behind the line."
“omg. It’s unwatchable” @trae young haters😂
Yeah exactly. Like Trae young is pretty close to Steph in size and athleticism. The difference between them in game is percentage points of shooting and maybe the ability to see a play .1 seconds earlier.
"And his record will probably get broken soon enough.  Luka is on pace to break this record and Trae Young is slightly behind Mitchell’s pace, but not by much.  Mitchell is making 2.48 threes per game while Luka is at 2.49 and Trae also rounds up to 2.48 but is a bit less.  Too soon to tell with the 2019 and 2020 draft, but doesn’t look like anyone is shooting at the same volume as these three, but some day soon Steph 2.0 is gonna come through and be making 3-4 threes a game and completely shatter this record."
Yea let’s just replace trae young with rondo who’s 10x worse offensively just because he plays better defense.
"""I am Trae Young, and I approve this game."""
The difference between a star and a role player is actually massive which is why so many of the role players and bench guys get shuffled in and out of the league every year and the stars stay stars. The gap between Steph and Trae Young or Ja Morant is massive and many would consider Trae and Ja to be better than role players so imagine Steph vs the generic 8th man PG for a team who could get replaced easily. 1 star can easily overshadow an entire 5 man unit in basketball if the 1 star is good enough.
They straight up were talking like he was Trae Young on defense
Trae young is a good example
Guards will be James harden starter Kyrie irving Zach lavine Bradly beal starter Trae Young  Forwards  Greek freak starter Kevin Durant starter D.  Saboins Kris Middleton Jayson Tatum  Centers Joel embiid Gucci mane Vuc
"""na uh you""   -Trae Young"
Trying to sound smart is when you use words where they don't fit. r/nba is legislating that trae young is a flopper! #wordoftheday
"Scoring is very easy to accurately measure, as is efficiency.   Defense is not as easy, it requires a bunch of different analytical tools to capture opponent fg%, foul rate, +/-, matchup data, some measurements like RAPTOR and VORP can help but ultimately a combination of that and watching basketball with a good understanding of team defense and the coaching system are required to properly analyse someone's input on that end.   To say a player ""gives up 25 on the other end"" is not a fair or valid statement in a theoretical world. Basketball isn't played in a 1v1 setting, a coach shouldn't have Trae Young guard LeBron every time down the court, because LBJ is dropping 50 with ease.   The theoretical situation you are posing needs to be fallible, by saying they're similar defense to IT in 17-18, or they're a 5'9 PG with a neutral wingspan and poor team defense or some equivalent."
"You get Trae Young.   You might not win a ring with the guy, but the guy can still be worth a max."
"Nah. Trae Young exists. IT blocked Demarcus Cousins and Trevor Ariza. More than you can say for Trae.   Also what's Wilt's record on finals appearances, finals wins, playoff wins, compared to LEbron and Jordan. There is a reason that Celtic fans who say Russell  is better than Chamberlain, say ""he really lived up to the name 'Wilt' especially when it mattered the most"""
you said something and had 0 facts to back it up   Middleton scored more isolation points per game than Trae Young did last year but I’m guessing he can’t create for himself either
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
A Trae Young free throw
"I would also guess that it might be because Draymond and Embiid are names that the average NBA fan knows, whereas Daniel Theis is not.  I bet Korkmaz gets less leeway on calls than Trae Young for example.  Theis plays a physical post game, but not in any way that should draw nearly as many calls as he gets.  I honestly think it's a subconscious thing rather than something overt."
trae young came out of Norman so cheer for the Hawks
"Can’t believe the hawks won with basically 4 of their rotation players. Capella has been a monster lately- 12 offensive rebounds is nuts.  Trae had a sports movie performance, sucking hard in the 1st half even missing free throws only to take over in the 4th and bring us back. Huerter should be starting over cam from here on.   So confused about what the pistons are doing.  Less than 10 minutes for bey and doumbouya with all vets starting and playing most of the minutes. Are they getting pulled after missing one or two shots? If you’re going to have the worst record why not give more reps to the young guys and get one of the studs in the draft with a proper tank.  Grant has been impressive in both games against us- can see why he wanted his own team (even if he probably won’t be the best player on a contender)"
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
Statistical evidence that Trae Young is a bitch
No Trae Young
Trae is a young clown.
"For all my peeps who don't read articles  &gt;The Cavs are no longer asking Sexton to be a point guard. They drafted him at no. 8 in 2018 and gave him the keys to the offense as a rookie, but that was never his game. He’s not Luka Doncic or Trae Young, who can score and pass at a high level. Sexton walks on the court for only one reason.   Basically he is just comparing them as PG to SG."
"No he doesn't attack the basket the same way because he isn't built the same like you say.  When you are a smaller player you are taught to seek the contact, it allows you to absorb the hit easier and finish the play if you are the one initiating. It also allows the smaller player to create separation from the rim protection because it creates a small gap when they nudge off. Guys like Lebron and Jordan like you say, just barrel through they don't need to do this (though they will in many situations, such as Lebron dipping the shoulder to bump some extra space).  What I mean is that Nash doesn't even do that, he looked to finish only open shots or craftier layups to avoid the contact. Likely in order to preserve his back as much as possible as contact takes its toll regardless how ready you are to absorb it.  There is also the perception aspect. Because Trae is smaller, it looks more like a foul when he gets bumped or hit by bigger stronger guys. The same amount of force will send Trae flying where Lebron wont bother. That is why Lebron is seen to get less fouls, because often it doesn't 'look' like a foul. Refs are people too, and just as susceptible to things like ""well Young went flying so it's a foul"".  That is where the discrepancy comes in. The baiting on the leaning back into a trailing defender maybe accounts for a couple FTs a game over the course of the season averaged out relative to Nash, where the real reason for the increased attempts is because Trae is looking to score more, and the reasons I've outlined. Again, Trae obviously stretches the rules to his advantage, and does look for the foul because often that is the ""correct"" play when you consider the point is to score the ball. It's a reffing and consistency issue more than a Trae is cheating or foul baiting issue."
Trae Young lives rent free in yalls heads
Never seen this much hate for a guy with a 0.500 record. Imagine when we’re actually good. Every Trae Young thread gonna have 200 hate comments in the first 30 minutes
"In 1217 career regular season games, Steve Nash totalled 3384 FTA. (2.8 per game, 3.8 FGA per FTA as a pass-first-to-a-fault guy)  In 155 career regular season games, Trae Young has tallied 1118. (7.2 per game, 2.5 FGA per FTA)  It's not even close to the same level of reliance on foul hunting."
Trae Young responding to criticism  r/nba RENT FREE
"Trae “No, U” Young"
"Because Embiid's and Smart's flopping affect the games differently. Most of Smart's flops are on defense by drawing charges which he gets 1-3x a game. No easy score, just a turnover. Embiid's flopping directly lead to FTs. He sure does get contact but he seeks most of those then exaggerates it. For all the talent AND SIZE of this generational player, he sure resorts to flopping a lot. Smart does flop on offense too but he's not as egregious as Embiid because 1) much less volume, and 2) he's a guard attacking bigs. Embiid flops on the slightest touch from bigger and smaller players alike. He's worse than Giannis or Trae Young. Giannis is big and he absorbs contact and gets superstar calls. Trae is a guard and baits contact and gets superstar calls. Embiid is big and baits like a small guy along with his superstar calls."
I see that Trae Young finally bouncing back a bit. Wonder what happened to all those “top 5 pg” posts?....
"Trae Young needs a Just For Men sponsorship, that boy is going to go bald by 25"
Needs Trae Young
"John wants a Max contract, Hawks can't afford to pay him that at same time Deandre Hunter is having a improve year averaging near 17 pgg. So Between Trae, Clint, gallinari, Hunter and Hawks other young wings, you can see were this get complicated."
"He should already be considered one right now.  For comparison, I just looked and he beats out Trae Young in PPG, TS%, WS/48, BPM, PER.  Does anyone think Trae Young is not a star?"
Trae Young had a big game! Checks box score and sees 19 free throws... that explains it
TRAE YOUNG IS BACK❄️
"ESPN: Trae Young repeatedly hits, grabs John Collins"
"I’ve always believed in Trae Young, never doubted at all"
"Hawks players put up some fucking numbers today.     - John Collins 31 points and 11 boards.   - Clint Capela 27 points, 26 boards and 5 blocks.   - Trae Young 38 points, 10 assists."
Fuck r/NBA says Trae Young
Sexton is who everyone thought trae young was
Collin sexton is who trae young thinks he is
Sixers are the Trae Young of NBA teams
It’s the NBAs problem. They let star guards like harden and trae young do it. It’s a part of the game. I don’t enjoy it but I’ll take the points any day of the week.
Kemba Walker deserves to be included in the same conversation as great offensive players such as Trae Young and James Harden!
"I’m from Oklahoma and think I’m qualified enough to say Trae Young is the best active player from OK right now  Edit: seeing now Trae was born in Lubbock, Texas despite attending all of his schooling in Oklahoma"
"Zion plays like a worse sophomore Trae Young  Gets you buckets - but he is more limited on offense. And gives just as many points up on defense.  He's not just a bad but willing defender but he looks like he doesn't understand defense (late rotations, caught off guard, leaves good shooters open, bad or no help defense, no rim protection somehow)"
I'll stand by my word that Zion for all the ability he has in the paint on offense simply cannot be considered the best player of his draft class for as long as he doesn't get at least respectable on defense.  He is closer to sophomore Trae Young than Sophomore Tatum and the Pels won't be contenders unless he develops a lot.
Great list besides Oklahoma. Current best active player is Trae Young. Blake is sadly a shell of himself from just a couple years ago.
"Yes Nash with 3 FTA per game foul baited the same as trae young, 16 fta in the game he was talking about."
He is Trae Young last year or worse.
Trae Young is not a fucking star. There fixed it
He is 20 and very few 20 year old have ever been as talented as him...I think he will be fine ... just needs some time to grow and maybe lose 10 lbs .. I like his long term prospects .. he will add some range ... for example anyone that would want Trae young over him for example is soft imo...I don’t care about stats this and that...I look at Zion and see a “good” basketball player and mind ... I look forward to his career
"There are 2 bonus spots that don't have to be front court or back court players. Because of the records he gets in over randle, bam, lavine, middleton, vucevic. Sabonis, harden, beal, KD, Giannis, embiid, tatum brown, kyrie and trae young are locks most likely. He gets in at 11 or 12 which are positionless. This is dependent on the sixers staying at the top of the east."
How the hell does the Hawks have 3 all-stars not named Trae Young? Good team!
"Tobias Harris and Trae Young is the most replaceable in the All star roster. And Bam, Sexton, and Zach will have the best chance to sneak in."
"Woah dude calm down... Using last season’s logic, Trae Young was a starter last year with worse numbers than what Beal has now and a team that was just as bad?  Beal is averaging 35 POINTS PER GAME on very accurate shooting numbers along with 5 assists and 5 rebounds a game.  He’s broken about 15 different records this season, numbers similar to 80’s Jordan. It’s an All Star Game anyway so who really gives AF who starts and who doesn’t? It’s an exhibition.  Means diddly squat in the scheme of things."
How tf is Beal a starter over Brown? Who cares if he’s the leading scorer his team is literally the worst in the league. Im not saying that’s his fault but we get mad at guys like Trae young but give him a pass
I am so happy trae young isn't on my team..thank god
i swear i love trae young but hes so fucking annoying to watch
"I mean Trae Young is quite good at baiting defenders into those fouls and the refs give it to him, its easy points.   Lonzo doesn't even have a convincing enough handle to attack the rim in a half-court setting, even when he does get there he avoids contact because somehow despite mostly fixing his 3pt shot the dude still cannot shoot free throws for shit. I don't understand this guy"
"He was never snubbed... here are all the diff PGs in the NBA that made a All Star game during Conley career (2007 - present) whom were BETTER than Conley when they made the All Star team or where playing equally as well, but played in the East...  West - Nash, Tony Parker, CP3, Steph, Westbrook, Dame, Kidd, Deron Williams, Iverson  East - Kyrie, Rose, Rondo, Deron Williams, Arenas, Billups, Kidd, Joe Johnson, Iverson, Wall, Teague, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba, Dragic, Trae Young  Only these 4 guys can you even argue that MAYBE Conley was more deserving than, but again all these dudes played in the East...  Devin Harris, Mo Williams, Joe Johnson, Jrue Holiday  Sooooo, yea.. never snubbed... never really deserved it. All Star is best of the best... not best solid consistent players"
Also Trae Young
Gary Trent is what Trae Young aspires to be when he gets older.
So your confirming that trae young is fan of me too?
"Not over Beal Kyrie isn’t.  Imagine averaging 35PPG and not starting. If Trae Young started last season on a horrible team, Beal HAS to start this season.  They set a precedence."
"Grant is playing great, but there are guys playing better than him on better terms.  You can be an all-star on a terrible team (exhibit a trae young) but to get in that way you need to be really playing next level ball, and Grant isn't there yet.  Respect to him though, he's proving a ton of people wrong"
This is his job. He's employed by Trae Young.
"You brought up Trae Young and his record last year. Kemba Walker was also an Eastern Conference starter. That’s a dumb argument. Were there Eastern Conference players last year playing as well as Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown? That were winning games as well?  The Kyrie Irving hate is unreal on this sub. I’m not even going to vote and Kyrie Irving and James Harden will easily be named Eastern Conference All Star starters. They deserve it too, unlike the overrated player that wanted to be in Washington and has the worst record in the NBA."
"Now this has just become a pedantic disagreement about what ""getting exposed"" means.   If the Bron and AD are out with Covid, the Lakers won't ""get exposed"" - they'll just get their ass kicked because they don't have their two best players.   Getting exposed means that your flaws are brought into light or your keys to success are revealed, which allows people to take advantage of that to beat you. For example, Trae young was exposed for trying to foul bait excessively, and his tricks didn't work the next week or so and his numbers crashed. He had to make some adjustments to get back to his normal success."
"This “I know because I played high school ball” take is almost always bad. Yes, Westbrook cares about his stats. The Thunder liked him having the ball, but having that statistical season wasn’t just a byproduct of that. 10 rebounds wasn’t just because they wanted him to grab and go. That’s not something that should be controversial. It can be beneficial to some extent and still be a form of stat chasing.   I don’t know about the Chris Paul dirty take, but hopefully you aren’t saying players are totally fine with the antics of guys like Paul. There are obviously players who think stopping in front of someone in transition is bullshit. We just had Nash make a comment about “playing the game the right way” while complaining about Trae Young. You can call that hypocritical but this idea that it’s a non-basketball playing take is so ridiculous. Or maybe Nash got cut from his JV team."
"It was easier last year because no one cared if Trae Young scored. Now that the Hawks are trying to win, it gets a lot harder to score. He isn't going to see last year's efficiency unless he gets better."
True but that means Trae Young will also get a look before Beal
That doesn’t really matter for the all star game. Trae Young started last year.
THJ is currently the 2nd option on a hurt Mavs team.  Clarkson is a bonafide 6MOTY candidate yearly. Not a role player.  Eric Gordon is on a trash team so his stats don’t matter.  Malik Beasley is on the worst team in the league rn so his stats don’t matter as well. No player who puts up 18 on a good team is a role player.  AD has a career average of 67.2% if his FG assisted. So that stat means absolutely fuck all. Hunter doesn’t have to create on his own because he has Trae fucking Young on his team.
Trae Young eFG%: .472  Brogdon eFG%: .538  You tell me.
If your measure of ability is efficiency then DeAndre Jordan is the best player in the NBA...  Trae Young TS%: 57.8%  Malcolm Brogdon TS%: 57.6%  Now please tell me who is more efficient??? You are a casual that doesn’t understand how the game is played.
If Trae Young makes it and Beal doesn’t *again* then an all star appearance will have lost all meaning in my eyes
Tell that to Trae Young last year
I agree with  you in the first half. This trade is bad for the hawks becuase we lose so much depth and size. I think we should keep the roster unchanged and reevalutate if we are not on track for the playoffs at the deadline. Plus beal is not a good defender so him with trae young would not be good.
Lol would be peak Kings to get a re-do on that pick and end up taking Ayton over Trae Young even on the re-do  Which one are people taking: MPJ or Colin Sexton long term
"To me it seems pretty obvious who it should be right now, Durant, Harden, and Kyrie, Brown and Tatum, Embiid, Giannis and Middleton, Sabonis and Brogdon, and Trae Young and Brad Beal as the last two. The only one I really regret not having room for is Adebayo, so maybe him over Sabonis, but its close."
"I doubt it. Nobody was covering the Nets last year and even though Hawks were a terrible team, Trae was still a young rookie getting coverage. The Nets have been the most reported team in the league this year and I would see Kyrie getting a lot of votes even if he hurt his image"
"There's some absolutely amazing young talent in the league right now.      Just to name a few..Luka, Jaylen, Jayson, Donovan, Trae, Zion, Ingram, Booker, Bam, Sabonis and Morant are all younger than 25 years old."
Trae Young is in competition for the whiner MVP

Trae young is not exactly efficient rn lol
People were saying Trae Young was better than Curry a month ago
You don’t think people look up to the face of the NBA? Or see that behavior working and emulate it? It’s like Trae Young foul bating. You don’t think he saw Harden doing it and said “hold my beer”?
Zion is Devin Booker/Bradley Beal/Trae Young levels of Bad on D.
Nah I feel like jimmy butler had a more successful season than Trae Young last year
Trae Young is a bitch.   I hope every game someone steps under his landing space.
Can’t be true. Trae Young is on the team
Trae young defense makes Bruce brown look like a serviceable nba player lol
"these refs really giving trae young more fts then kd, harden, and kyrie combined"
Even more impressive that they’re doing this while carrying first team no defense PG Trae Young on that end of the floor
Trae Young is now officially Hitler.
So glad Trae Young is not on our team. Dude is hard to watch
Off topics but I personally welcome the idea that eventually Stephen A. will say on Live TV that Trae Young is in the MVP conversation
Trae Young is 2-12 lol. And is starting to foul bate again like he did the last time we played them. Rough
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
Since they blocked the shit out of Trae Young at the rim every shot for both teams has been uncontested
fuck trae young
TRAE YOUNG REVENGE GAME VS STEVE NASH
"Dude. Fucking KAT, Ben Simmons and Trae Young are considered top 25, the Admiral would be top 10 for sure."
Trae Young in shambles
"That’s without talking how bad he’s on defense. Is he IT level bad? No, but is he much better than Trae Young? Also no."
Most overrated: Trae Young and Ben Simmons coming off wins   Most underrated: Trae Young and Ben Simmons coming off losses
Are you doing a bit or something? Trae Young quite possibly gets more hate on this sub than any active player.
"What’s crazy to me is that some players get a pass for being bad defenders because they’re the teams entire offensive load, and some don’t. I understand Trae is far beyond a bad defender, he’s a turnstile in the literal sense. But young guards are almost always bad on defense and Trae was that teams entire offensive workload last year. If he’s still easily the worst defensive player on a terrible defensive team in 3 or 4 years, then I’d be more concerned."
Trae Young. He's way too streaky for my taste. Puts up great raw stats but I don't think he's #1 option quality on a good playoff team.
Trae Young
Trae young put up 30/4/9 on 60% ts and no one treats him like they do Luka
wait did Nate robinson dribble thru their legs Trae Young style or was he just so small that he physically went under someone
"Because it's a team game. It's long been a complaint of players like Trae Young and Devin Booker. Putting up great numbers while your team is playing like shit.   In addition to that some coaches don't enable players to do that. It's usually upcoming star players on trash teams, or established stars that haven't realized their on their way down that pad consistently."
Trae Young bad defense and empty stats -&gt; Trae Young the foul baiter
Lol this dumb ass coward really used a throwaway account to talk shit about Trae young. Imagine getting to that point in life
"Young player  Good stretch against good teams  Profit  2 weeks ago it was Ja. A month ago it was Trae, lol. It's all quite silly"
"Who knows, only time will tell. But you can't have a league with only 4 contending teams and everyone else tanking. Should the Mavs try to bottom out since they are below .500? You have to stop tanking at some point, and we have one of the best young cores in the league as is. If we tanked another year, Trae would likely do whatever he could to get out.  We tanked, we drafted our core that includes a future all NBA guard, and now we hope for the best, like any franchise that cant just be mismanaged for a decade and then sign the arguable GOAT because of their location and past success. Maybe we'll have to trade some guys off, maybe we'll peak as a 2nd round exit or ECF exit. Maybe Hunter  or cam (looking more like hunter as of late) turns into the next 2 way star like Leonard or George and we 2019 Toronto Raptors our way to a ring with injuries to another major player leading the way. You never know what can happen, so there's no point in just sucking forever.    And FWIW, I really like Lebron, hes probably my favorite player that isnt a current or former Hawk, and I generally root for him to win titles since I think he really is a strong contender to be the GOAT.  I font hate the lakers either, but some of the fans of that franchise are the biggest bunches of dipshits out there lol"
"While I think Trae young is certainly above average as a shooter, LA had Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard as their starting back court last night. That's a defensive tragedy right there."
"We already bottomed out. We drafted our future with Trae/Hunter/Cam/Collins/OO, for better or for worse. So now we're in the position of having a young team learning to win, and hope all these guys pan out. Thats why we surrounded them with solid veterans in the offseason instead of g-leaguers like last season. Not everyone can sign lebron and go from lottery team to contenders over night."

"His knee is never going to stop being bum, and he's the worst defensive guard next to Trae Young."
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3. Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."
Not a single player has put up 37+ against the bulls since Dec. 23 vs the Hawks when Trae Young had 37.
Those are..... Trae young numbers. Such a weird start line for a center lol
"Makes sense. Right now his value on defense relative to his position is probably like Trae Young, and he should at least aim to get to Steve Nash-level."
"Usually depends on the position. Makes no sense to put list rebounds before assists for a traditional PG for example. Nobody says Trae Young has 20pts/3reb/10ast, they list it as 20pts/10ast/3reb"
"Wish I could find the link, but it’s a reference to the time that somebody made a thread on the topic, and the geniuses on r/nba said they would rather have Derrick White than Trae Young on their team"
Trae Young? Lol hell no why not Derrick White instead
"Bruh you can't just take stats like that at face value, teams averaged more FTs back then. Look at free throw rate. Michael Jordans career high FTr: .459, career average FTr: .358.   James Hardens career high FTr: .592, career average FTr: .526.    Trae Young this season currently has a .578FTr.  And people DID complain about MJ getting special treatment by the refs. Even his fellow NBA players complained about it."
Trae young actually flops tho like he jumps backwards into defenders for foul calls lol
"As a massive Young Bull stan, I'd take him over Trae Young in the NBA, but Trae would be a better fit for the olympics, at least offensively."
"Yeah, I fully expect Trae Young or Doncic to break them after him."
"Guys like Harden and Trae Young bait for fouls with rule technicalities that need to be rewritten to make those types of things a non-foul.   Guys like Embiid, Butler, and Lebron actually just get fouled and would just score an easy basket if they didn't get hacked."
Well mostly same reason people hate on trae young. Harden and trae throw themselves at people. Embiid invites the contact. He may flail according to some but he’s not throwing his legs out and purposely side jumping into guys like harden and young do.
"I think Collin is doing good this season. With that said, why do you think he got robbed? They already have a lot of guards and they are adding 2 new ones in Ja Morant and Trae Young to the pool. Do you think Collin Sexton is better than either of them? I don't."
Damn so that means Trae Young is going to win three titles and go to five straight finals?
"Dame could potentially beat Ray, but it's at least 5 years away.   Trae isn't even in the discussion yet imo. He's way too young to be talking about records he *might* hold in 10+ years"
Yes Kris Dunn &gt; Trae Young.  You could say they are equal but imo offense is always more important.
"Collin Sexton BIG TIME I been keeping an eye on Collin Sexton ever since Lil Yachty first mentioned him in a song. (Yachty and other ATL rappers shout out Sexton a lot)  At Alabama he was an absolute beast. Can get a bucket instinctively. Plays hard all the time. Has a mf engine boy don’t ever get tired. And He can shoot and get to the CUP easy.  Then he got draft by the Cavs he played really well as a rookie and got really high Usage. He is not Lebron as a rookie but Kylie is comparable. If Luka and Trae Young player Kyrie rookie season he wouldn’t see no ROY trophy either.  Now fast toward two years later he has had leaps of improvement in shooting efficiency, he’s automatic at the line and defense went from none existent to an occasional appearance.   Collin drops big offensive numbers all the time he’s becoming a better playmaker and he’s just fun to watch. Also he’s a bucket on 2k21.   Collin  Sexton is a future star in this league   The only guys on this list close to his potential is Ayton, Jackson, Sabonis, Collins in that order them other guards he not on his level Murray is closest."
"Everyone is allowed to have creative differences.   Here is mine. No one wants to play with a ball hog.  Having 5 assists and 7 turnovers one game then 8 turnovers and 6 assists and then 10 assists and 5 turnovers does not mean you are not a ball hog.   Creative difference number 2. Trae Young puts his hand under the ball, the ball stops and then he continues dribbling almost every time he has the ball.  That was a travel, is a travel in the rulebooks, and was supposed to be a focus of being called the last few years.  Luka is also bad with it.  Coby White packs a suitcase and does it."
"Kyrie, Harden, Middleton, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown to me seems like the list. Guys like Sexton or Brogdon even have a chance if their teams are still in playoff spots. I hope Lavine makes it but its unlikely."
Trae Young doesn’t pass the analytics test this year. He’s putting up Brandon Jennings like percentages.
"Damn, that’s savage! Thank you King! Okay I take back any and all criticism of Trae Young that I’ve ever spoken."
"? Trae Young is a better offensive player than anyone on the Pacers, when did I say the Pacers had someone better?"
Trae Young and Kris Dunn
nah I'm pretty sure I was told trae young was better so he must be on this list too right lol
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I’d put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That’s 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There’s 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
"Trae Young with his playstyle will probably never have sustained high percentages. He’s always going to have high usage, lots of defensive gravity, and throw up a ton of extremely difficult shots. There will be games he catches fire and hits a ton, and games where he chucks up 13 3s and hits 1. But no matter what you’re guarding him ready for the trigger.   If he was strictly a catch and shoot, I’m sure his numbers percentage-wise would be very high but that also takes away from who he is as a player.   Comparing him or anyone to Steph is stupid since he’s the greatest shooter ever and is the only person whose ever shot the percentages he does while taking the tough shots that he does"
it's crazy to see how good curry is at shooting. dude was shooting 40-45% from 3 back in the day taking these shots no one else dared to take. now guys like trae young and dame lillard do it and they're both considered great shooters at 36-38% from 3. the fact that curry has been taking these tough 3s AND he's consistently shooting low-mid 40% from 3 is insane
"[Yeah like a week ago](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-star-index-kyrie-irving-in-his-bag-stephen-curry-heating-up-and-trae-young-deserves-an-apology/). Is it the world's greatest apology? No, but he admits he was overly inflammatory and the article was imbalanced"
"Pretty sad quote.   I don't know why, but I feel like Tatum and Luka are the young guns that are going to fill the void. Zion is special, but I don't know....Trae, Embiid, Morant, Wiseman, Edwards and Lamelo are there as well in potential, but I can't be sure. LeBron was/is special among the prodigies."
"For his career, Steph Curry shoots 43.5% from three. For his career, Trae Young shoots 34.7%."
Trae Young pretty much Is Stephen Curry.
Try doing that to Harden and Trae Young and see the results from the bench after your 6th foul.
DLo is actually what everyone memes that Trae Young is. A bottom ten defender in the league that despite decent box score stats doesn’t drive efficient offense when he’s on the floor.
"Lol you guys don’t have that same energy when it comes to other young players. Soon as Trae, Booker, Ben, Bagley have a bad game you guys are quick to call them busts and overrated"
"Haha that phrase is just funny to me. “Much better numbers on a garbage roster” after essentially the same roster (switching out a couple role players) made the WCF just last year. And it’s funny to me how guys like Booker and Lavine and Beal and Trae young get reamed with the “good stats bad team” label, but here is “good stats bad team, is he better than curry?”"
Stand within 6 feet of Trae Young? Jail.  Play defense against the Lakers? Jail.
"Last year Gobert was about the same with us. We’re better off this year with Favors but without Rudy I think we go from top 4 in offense and defense to maybe 10th offense and 27th defense. I think Embiid and Jokic are the other two in the conversation, but I’d probably agree Steph would be number 1 by this metric. I’d go Steph-Embiid-Jokic-Gobert-Doncic in terms of dependency. And shoutout to trae young fwiw"
"“Who would you rather have, Lu Dort or Trae Young”"
Trae young said he learned his foul baiting from Nash. Nash averaged like 2 free throw and trae young is just fucking lying throuth his teeth.
"I’m sure you’re not biased at all, u/TRAE-YOUNG-BETTER lol"
So Trae Young without the 3pt shot?
"&gt; dog you called ""Doncic, Trae, KAT, Jokic, Booker, maybe Tatum, Zion and Murray."" future hall of famers.   There is a better chance of every single one of those players making the hall of fame than of LaMelo being a Top 5 PG in the next 3 seasons.  As for Trae vs Tatum, I posted that a *month* ago, before Tatum began his best season to date. In other words, Trae had already proven his ability to compete for scoring titles. Tatum is just now doing so. They both have great chances at HOF status. Have fun betting against KAT. I said *maybe* Murray (your saying he is ""nowhere close"" to a bid is absurd, you can't even spell his name). I said *maybe* Zion. Booker is pretty much a given dude. Championships are not a requirement.  I have no interest in debating with you any further. You are pretty radical. You act like I'm absurd for pretty conservative takes (I'm literally saying the league's best young players are going to be great- future HOFers, and LaMelo has a long way to go and I think his being a disappointment is the more likely outcome). You also just repeated what I said, only *capitalizing* the word 'maybe,' in the context of pointing out the alleged absurdity of my idea. And you don't seem to understand that KAT and Booker are proven talents, raring to go throughout this entire decade (while simultaneously believing LaMelo is a surefire star in the very near term).  Frankly, you argue like a teenager on Xbox Live, and are being rude (YOU THINK *THIS*!?!?!? ARE YOU AN IDIOT?? YOU'RE *INSANE*!!! GET THE *FUCK OUT OF HERE WITH THIS SHIT, YOU'RE EMBARASSING!!!*) for no reason.  I'm not as high as you on LaMelo. I'm higher than you on the HOFers I projected. It's not that big of a deal."
if you replace Trae Young then the Hawks are no longer good
"This is dumb.  The rule is legal guarding position.  Get your torso in front of the dribbler and don’t move forward and it is legal, as it should be.  Using a shoulder to dislodge a dribbler?  One of the dumbest ideas I have heard.  If anything go back to calling travelling and carries so the defenders have a chance.   If Coby White, Luka, Trae Young or whoever are allowed to pick up the ball pause and eat a sandwich then crossover...that shit has to be called for defenders to be able to guard someone.   And then the 8 foot step backs, the fly unnaturally sideways in a pure foul bait move.....those are the issues with the game in 2021 and make it at times frustratingly unwatchable."
"Have you lost your. whaever all of you jordan fans are giving so much credit to him when you use literall no context your acting he is the undisputed goat, he is goat or second to kareem or bron. Gary payton is a PG. Jordan was also a midrange shooter you know, interior defense BEST TERMS 1980s are better in interior defense more physical, 2010s WAY MORE talent, 2000s WAY more talent than 1990s other than gary who else oh dennis rodman and pistons and WHO ELSE, Lakers no, Boston yes. Look buddy lebron played against in the finals 3 times, all time great defender 15 defensive selections tim duncan, best defensive era no 2000s-1980s and then 1990s look curry plays in 1990s averages 35-40 proof 3 ball nothing defended the 3 ball back then, kd can shoot from anywhere he want, lebron passing 3 ball and fadeaway he is averaging 26-30 ppg, harden what defense can stop his stepback 3, dirk who stops fadeaway, kobe you kinda no this one, IQ, impossible shot maker which means no defense stops this guy, insane fade and has every move in his arsenal. Kawhi insane defense a great scorer, Westbrook dunking and passing and rebounds, klay catch/shoot 3 easily averaging 23-25ppg. Chris paul insane passing and great scorer and defender, larry legend survived in a more physical era one of the greatest shooters in nba history, impossible shot maker, rebounding, passing insane, Magic survived a tougher era, un human passing, good scorer, rebounding, anybody else? Oh Kareem unblockable skyhook, all time great defender, leading scorer, won mvp while not even making the playoffs more to say? Damian lillard logo 3, passing free throws, young star trae young logo threes and passing. More Dwyne wade fadeaway, AI for god sake 38-40ppg a game in 1990s crossover, jumpshot handles, IQ, passing, Ray allen leading in 3s."
I used to really like Trae Young and Luka but this feels like all they do now
"Refs allowed him to get away with murder. He was what Trae Young was to offense for defense. Crafty mfer. He was crafty on both ends but defensively, he was just another level with his game. He could also run for days."
"Oh yeah cause he’s a shooting guard lol go get ready for school and go double check your stats young man. Also trae young is a usual 20+ 10+ assists man. Chris Paul, Fox, lamelo ball, Fred van fleet lol all better team players then currys bum ass. Go back to beating off to his wife ya clown 🤡"
Jimmy Butler this season: 6.7 made FTs 18.2 PPG = 36.8%  Trae Young this season: 9.3 made FTs 26.7 PPG = 34.8%
"""Trae Young is better than Steph!""  ""Dame &gt; Kyrie &gt; Steph""  ""Now Curry's seeing what it's like not having 4 all stars around him and he's getting exposed""  ""Curry is not a top 10 player anymore, the landscape of the league is shifting""  ""Curry is not a floor raiser, he's only a ceiling raiser because he played with great players""  ""Without Klay Curry is being exposed""  All real, actual takes from the brilliant minds on this sub, many of which were upvoted.  I got ALL the fuckery saved, and will have an absolute blast posting the comments and posts at the end of the season."
The Trae Young of the NFL
"Also Steve Nash and the ""that's not basketball"" remarks to Trae Young. Shit is killing interest in the game, I don't think anyone likes watching free throws."
Vince Carter was teammates with Hakeem Olajuwon and Trae Young
"LaMelo. It's early but give me the 6'8 point guard. Trae Young is amazing, but if I'm gunning for a championship I would gamble on LaMelo being a star"
"Yeah what the fuck are these comments here, it's Trae Young by a mile."
"Trae fucking Young. Don't get me wrong, I think that LaMelo will turn out to be a good player, but Trae Young is an offensive superstar. His defense is a huge concern, but I'm willing to look past that due to how good he is on the offensive side.  Just gotta surround Young with defenders."
"I'm rooting for it too man lmao. Beal, Harden, and Kyrie are all more popular though I'm not surprised he's below them I am surprised he's above Trae Young though I thought Young had fans that would put him above my guy"
Ball. Always go for the unknown. Ball could be anything - he could even be Trae Young!
lamelo ball his potential is better than trae young. this is who trae young’s gonna be his whole career not a winning player
It’s sad how only 5 post ups per game is considered abnormally high for today’s NBA. They’d rather swing it around 50 times looking for a 3 to brick or have Trae Young swing his arms around looking for a foul because “it’s slightly more efficient”
"As a Hawks fan, that still may be my favorite Trae Young play ever. I can’t even imagine how awesome it would have been if it went in."
"Yea my thing with the patience part is what I mentioned in the description.   You see all these young pgs that were also drafted in the lottery like fox, luka, trae, sexton, sga, morant, and now haliburton and lamelo. All these dudes were good pretty much right away and we're kinda just stuck with coby right now lol.   I get it tho he's an easy person to root for but I don't think I'd value someone like coby all that much in the long run"
"No, but it doesn’t matter. They will stay good long enough to outrun their pick obligations to the Pelicans.  Either Anthony Davis stays good and Trae Young comes to join him on the Lakers, or his body breaks down and the Lakers go into tank mode."
Some shameless shit going on in here.  I couldn't go three feet without reading about how overrated and awful Trae Young was going to be. I mean constantly.  Yet when I scroll through here no one wants to admit that shit.
Interesting he takes Lavine &gt; Trae Young. Young is a much better passer and both suck at defense.. Seems he can’t prioritise Young over Lavine when valueing Beal as a starter.  How do you guys feel about three Nets players making it?
"Trae Young.   Also Pascal Siakam.   He's a great complimentary piece to a superstar but he's not anywhere close to being a first option himself.   Despite what Raptors fans tell you, Siakam's game is still incredibly limited."
"Good question! No, I don’t think that. I think certain teams who have already found their young star that is capable of reaching a high enough ceiling should be looking to compete and get playoff reps in. So teams like the Hawks (Trae), Mavs (Luka), Pelicans (Zion), etc. shouldn’t be tanking since they already have that young star they can build around."
"I can’t believe calling Westbrook a top ten passer of all time is a comment that is upvoted lmao. I can name ten better since 2000: Nash, Kidd, Harden, Lebron, Jokic, Rondo, CP3, Rubio, Deron Williams, Trae Young"
"MPJ even though we'd have to give up some extra assets. He'd be primed to breakout in Atlanta playing with his friend and old PG Trae Young so he'd have all the opportunity in the world. As long as Gallo starts to return to his old self which he looks on track to do a temporary starting lineup of Trae, Huerter, MPJ, Gallo, and Capela is actually pretty good. If the hawks could unlock a guys like Porter Jr's potential they would have a franchise cornerstone on there hands to go along with Trae."
Watching mid 2000s team shoot 90 free throws in a game: I sleep  Watching Trae Young draw a foul: The NBA sucks and that’s why viewership is down
"KAT has always had a bad surrounding cast. They never win when he is out of the lineup. He can shoot really well and defends pretty decent, but he's never had a good NBA coach. He's certainly not weak and can hold his own, but he can't play a Lebron style physical without getting called for ticky tack fouls.   He also doesn't play like Lowrie where he complains all the time. KAT is constantly getting hit and fouled but nobody calls it because he's a big man and doesn't complain. This league doesn't benefit players like him any more. You get guys like Lowry, Trae Young or Harden that whine and complain for contact and KAT doesn't do that."
Trae Young is the worst at this. When he’s coming off a screen and has a defender chasing him and then just stops it’s so frustrating. It doesn’t seem like he should be rewarded that. It’s so terrible to watch.
Lillard trying the Trae Young move of jumping backwards into the defender off the screen? that fucking sucks man. pathetic
"If anyone should be nicknamed El Matador, it should be either Harden or Trae Young, who can't/don't play defense."
"I agree. If I'm a coach and trae young will jump into my player flopping for fts, I'll tell my players to give trae a concussion. He wanted fouls right? Well he got it, he shouldn't complain since he got what he wanted"
okay man have fun watching Trae Young shoot 42% from the field   i’ll take the 6’7 dudes flying through the air
"okay Dwade was attacking the rim and going at people all the time, plus he didn’t really become Wade until like 05 when the last of the defensive rules were changed to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game (https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf)  Chris Paul is the same as D Wade.   I have multiple comments explaining how Manu Ginobilli’s flopping is one of the worst thing to happen to basketball and it’s why the Spurs were so hated in the early 2000s.   Reggie Miller was also pretty well-hated and i didn’t like reggie as a player then and i don’t like him now.   Laimbeer is one of the dirtiest players to ever play, what a great example    the fact of the matter is that in the era of the 80s to 2005, it was all about getting into the paint and attacking the rim. yes you had mid range jumpshots, but that’s when the drive or the post game didnt work. and they didn’t flop nearly as blatantly. they bitched about calls, but Marcus Smart is embarrassing the way he flops for how good of a player he is. same with LeBron. 100 times out 100 give me guys who drive into the lane and then try to beat some ass like Kermit Washington. watching Jimmy Butler roll around in pain laughing and tickling other players on the court feels like something out of Baseketball    watching guys shoot 36% from 3 isn’t fun.  they miss 60% of the time and i can get that at my local high school. NBA superstar Trae Young makes 42% of his shots. who in gods name wants to watch that? it’s just a free throw contest.   and missed jump shots are uber less exciting. what is more fun to watch: 6’6 220 pogo stick Desmond Mason miss a layup against 6’10 Chris Wilcox or Coby White and Jordan Clarkson trading pull-up 3 clanks?"
"Because people are shooting a shit ton more jumpers as a percentage of total shots taken  The fouls we're seeing committed are still absolutely bullshit and making defenders play less intense D. Due to reffing being more and more strict on defenders, less defense is being played, which reduces the amount of fouls being committed because defenders can't touch players without gettin called four touch fouls.   Offensive players are also rewarded for foul hunting when on the perimiter, which makes the players hunt for offensive fouls more, which turns the game into this snoozefest where the refs are actually a part of the game with the decisions they make. That's why we're seein a record number of 3s even compared to just 5 years ago as there's no way to stop Trae Young going around a screen because he'll throw his ass back into you for a foul if you try to play defense  This 'gotcha' counterpoint of simply counting overall free throw numbers as proof that there is no problem to the way the game is being played has been already addressed a lot."
Lol but that’s how Trae young gets paid.
Trae Young backing his ass up into his defender and throwing up a “shot attempt” is literally making me sick to my stomach
trae young jumping backwads into ppl and getting the foul is peak insanity for this shit
"His fans also wanted him starting at PG over Harden, Beverley, Kemba, Trae Young. Only case where he got jiffed was Ronnie Price starting over him. And maybe Beverley in his second year."
"This is such a horribly simplistic way to view the quality of a passer. WB racks up a lot of assists due to the ridiculously high percentage of possessions that end with a shot by him, or a pass leading directly to a shot. His passing isn’t creative, accurate, or lead to particularly high percentage shots. He just accumulates a shitload of potential assists because the offense runs entirely through him. Box scores tell some of the story but not all of it.   Off the top of my head, current players that are better than WB has ever been as a passer. These players are more creative, have better passing accuracy, and their passes lead to high effective shots: Lebron, CP, Harden, Jokic, Luka, Trae Young, LaMelo.   Just off the top of my head, these are players today that are clearly better passers today than peak WB. If WB is the 8th best among his contemporaries, there’s no way he’s top ten all time."
"I love calling Trae Young by his nickname, “Meth Curry”."
"It’s an awesome replay angle. I’d be annoyed if the whole broadcast was like that lol.  But also, it’s not like “watching off-ball movement” is just this super fun, popular, common activity. Pretty much every casual fan and likely most normal viewers ball watch, and that’s okay! It makes things feel more cinematic and suspenseful. Hell, if Trae Young can get away with nothing but ball-watching, than fans can do it too :P"
And trae young literally going keijou with his ass.

Okay so I'm trying to process all of that.  So you're saying that Harden should be guarding power forwards? That's a pretty interesting idea I'm not sure how that would go And  I agree that Kyrie's defense isn't going to to make any all defense teams but it's not a detriment like someone like Trae Young for example.  And I'm not sure what you were implying about Deandre Jordan I think you are saying that his defensive game isn't that great and I would probably agree with you on that. I'm not sure if that's what you meant.  But this is essentially a Mike D'Antoni coached team of course Steve Nash is the head coach but D'Antoni is his top assistant and was Nash's Head coach during his best year's as a player and it's pretty much a version of his seven seconds offense that Nash played under and he taylored to James Harden later and all of the iterations defense was pretty much an elective course.  I'm not sure what to think about this Nets team on one hand this style of play has never been able to get a title The Rockets got pretty close with Chris Paul and Harden But the idea of the Three headed monster they have with KD Kyrie and Harden wonder's if they could out gun everyone else and maybe get a title.  Or maybe you can't get around fundimentals and defense always wins championships I guess we're going to see and I took an edible earlier and just realized I've been rambling writing a goddamn article about this shit and I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about so I'm going to end this here.
"The only dumb one is you. It's the EXACT same thing.  The entire league exagerates contact. If lebron didn't exagerate his contact he would get way less calls. Harden, Trae Young, Embid are the 3 biggest floppers in the league and where are there warnings? You see Jimmy Butlers latest flop, where is his warning? Why didn't Ja Morant get a warning last game but only Kuz and Lebron did.  And here's a gift for you pg flopping: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k6s91bP4pN0"
"Jimmer’s biggest issue was that he got spoiled by being the best player BYU had seen for a long, long time. This meant that he viewed himself as an offensive juggernaut, and that stymied his defensive development because the team wanted to maximize his efficiency.   BYU played a box-and-one zone defense that was shaped like a 2-3 zone, except the other 4 guys had to play extra defense to make up for Jimmer. His defense was Trae Young-level, but at least Trae has the offense to make him worth it."
"This is bad, but I wonder if it's considered worse if it's a flop as an offensive player with the ball. If all things are considered equal then Trae Young should have been suspended for the season after the last Lakers Hawks game haha, felt like every time down the floor."
Trae Harden Kobe (I cheat)  KD Hakeem    I’m young what can I say
Trae Young does worse shit than this every game but he gets no punishment
"Yeah, I want the real Trae Young to come back. Don't know what coach has done with him, but I want Trae from the logo to come back"
"I watched pretty much all of Luka's games the past two years, definitely not as much Trae(as I don't enjoy watching him as much, but I've still seen a good amount) so my contention is less that Trae is an excellent player and more so that saying Luka represents everything right about the league is going too far.   I do think you're being too harsh on Young though; he is a great passer/creator off the dribble and he's got a unique shot with really long range.   Both players are the beneficiaries of some of the softest calls in the NBA, and relentlessly whine when they're not getting whistles. Neither are great defenders(Trae being worse than Luka), and both have a tendency to go into hero-ball mode a little too often. Again, I prefer watching Luka, but painting him as the embodiment of all that is right in the NBA is too far."
I'd rather watch the WNBA than Trae Young.
"Give me Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and Gallo"
Trae Young should’ve been fined into oblivion
Which is why it's so appalling that the nba is specifically focusing on LeBron when there's trae young and Doncic out there
TJ McConnell out here thoroughly outplaying Trae Young and shit
"Meanwhile, nothing for guys like Harden, Trae Young, or Embiid."
Yup I think it was Dame who went out? He was next on the listen and got the blessing to play. In the past it was because the Suns record but I mean if Trae Young can start with the horrible Hawks a few years ago it shouldn’t matter.
"exactly. i think lebron, harden, embiid, etc accentuate it. no one can stop them from getting to the basket and they just want their bonus for taking punishment in the process. now kemba walker, trae young, etc are only doing it for the foul. those guys don’t finish through contact consistently in the nba so the only reason to look for contact for them is a bailout foul. i hate it"
this is where we disagree. i think harden is able to finish through contact and flops for the bonus. he could easily stop flopping and get to the rim. players like kemba and trae young who rely on flopping for bailouts would still do it
Why is Trae Young the thumbnail?
Anytime I watch trae young play basketball I see flops like this
"??????????????????????????????????????? you know that players coming off of injury often need a year to get into nba form. And if you're such a big part of a teams gameplan on both ends its gonna look rough. And sure simmons is the frontrunner for dpoy currently but unless your 1st option is trae young pg is better for your team than ben simmons. even then pg has a solid argument as he is one of the most well rounded players in the league and provides value off ball when he's further than 10 feet from the basket. If i were to build a team around 1 of them I'd choose the 6'11 point guard, even over ad but as a number 2 option pg is much more of a swiss army knife than ben simmons. you need someone to comfortably defend the opposing teams best guard/ wing pg is your guy. you need a shooter to clear out because your number 1 option is isolating, paul george can do it. you need someone to isolate because your #1 is being doubled? I hope you get my point. paul george is more than a meme and currently averaging 24/6/5 on 51/48/90.  PS: IIRC Ben simmons was out in last years playoffs and the 76ers were swept or did I miss something"
How come there is no warning for Trae Young or Luka though wtf they flop every game.
Realistically? What about Trae Young? Just because he is a zero off ball and on defense.
"The trae young effect. Once he got in last year, the dam broke."
Also starters are 50% votes by fans and Trae Young has a lot of popularity
"44% of his points come from free throws in that stretch. His Free Throw rate is down for 69% to 64% on the season so far.  In comparison, James Harden's highest FTR was 59% and been below 50% since his MVP season  Giannis has a FTR of 55% season  Peak LeBron was 51% in 2010 (but was 64% in the 2009 playoffs where he averaged 14 FTA/g)  Trae Young this season has a FTR of 57%   Jordan was 43% the season he averaged 37ppg and shot 12 FTA/g  Butler has to be regarded as one of the people ruining the game with their flopping and drawing fouls at that rate right?"
I think it’s because calls are much easier to see on the perimeter. It’s also easier to over exaggerate on any type of contact on the perimeter I.E. Trae Young or James Harden. While when you’re driving theirs could be 2 or 3 bodies all with their arms up blocking the view of the ref. Hence the frequent missed calls.
"Among the young stars in this league I think Luka, Trae and Ja will absolutely be better than Zion. No disrespect though this guy is a beast, but too one-dimensional."

"Outlets like ESPN and Bleacher Report just chase the hype, don’t worry, they’ll get bored of Lamelo soon same way they got bored of Trae Young and Zion"
"I think the situation matters here.  Tatum has been to the ECFs thrice already and if he fails to get to the finals in the next couple of seasons, the whole organization is pressurized to make moves to not waste the prime of Jays.   Zion is gonna be safe till the 2nd/3rd year of bis next contract because of the situation he is in. The roster is not properly constructed to his strengths and the timeline for contention window is gonna open only after bron retires.   Luka is already getting bashed for not performing to the MVP standards everyone expected from him, but the second he wins that MVP, he'll get the giannis treatment.   The rest of the young players like trae, Ja who play in small market teams will not have much pressure until the end of their next contracts because of the timeline of their rosters."
Trae Young was an all-star when Atlanta was worse than Orlando is now
I’m guessing it’s because he’s not a fan of Trae:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2925867-report-hawks-john-collins-has-several-issues-with-trae-young-running-offense
Trae Young could do that right now and that’s someone who’s already in the league shooting at a way higher volume then Steph did in his first 3 years by far
Trae young for me
"trae young kinda had his ""revenge"" last year tho"
Trae Young isn’t a winning player
One game &amp; he's better than All Star Trae young who Averaged 29/4/9 last year? Sure LMAO
LaMelo has bullied Trae young in their head to head matchups this season
Guess Trae Young doesn't exist
spurs playing beautiful defense also trae young look like dick dastardly
"Zion is like the one star who doesn’t complain about calls after every play. Love it.   Luka, Trae Young, and all the young stars already have the palms up after every play."
"For sure, theres always a risk/reward. I just, personally, believe in the value of having cap space in the future once you have a young core established more than I value older veterans coming in while its still too early for that young core to win. Gallo, Rondo, etc won't help them when Trae is 27/28 and that's typically the earliest a team is going to be able to compete for titles. There's a real risk of Atlanta being stuck in limbo once those guys get old, where Trae, Collins and Capela are in their primes and ready to win, while their supporting cast has aged out and their cap sheet is already full. I wouldn't want to use assets up for this season when I know that my main guys aren't good enough to lead a team to a deep playoff run or a title. I'd rather bank those assets and use them when Trae's time to challenge has actually arrived. That's just my preferred approach to team building though; being patient and then going all out once your best player can compete at the highest level"
Give Trae Young a few years
"More context needed here. Dlo is a good three point shooter, that’s pretty clear. Citing career numbers is pretty shaky here. What you’re really looking at is one season in Brooklyn in which he shot 32% on 6 attempts a game. This was the year he got injured and played terribly upon coming back. It’s not really in line with the rest of his career numbers either. In the last 3 years he’s shot 37% on 8 tries a game. Most of these looks are self created threes. The last few years he’s been around 4-5 self created and 3 catch and shoot looks. He’s shot around 39% on catch and shoot looks the last two years with his percentage at 36% this year. He’s shot 42% on pull ups this year while he was around 35% and 34% in the previous years.   8 threes a game, that is incredibly high volume. His three point attempt rate is 45%. I’m not sure if you’re suggesting his shooting percentage isn’t high or his attempt rate isn’t. That’s clearly a very high attempt rate. Dame is at 46% over that same stretch. Trae Young is at 41% for his career and only once has he been over 40%. Getting up 8 threes a game at 37% is efficient offense. You can’t talk about his shooting like he’s some spot up guy putting up 3 a game at 35%. Getting up more threes at even average efficiency has solid value.  Russell’s problem is not his three point shooting. It’s the other stuff. Relatively speaking, if he was as good at the rim as he is from three we wouldn’t be having this conversation."
"No, Gobert is definitely front-runner and his defense has been beautiful this year. But he also has Conley at the point of attack as well as Favors to back him up, meaning any stat that is all-encompassing defensively is not going to value him first as he has significant help. Capela's defensive point of attack is Trae Young, so it is much easier to singularly highlight his defensive value  Not everything has to be a direct comparison. Using the validity of a singular stat to bolster an argument is the problem I have. The stat isn't a picture, just one brush used to paint the picture."
&gt;	I really don’t understand how people are upvoting this post   Cuz this sub hates Trae Young
Marcus Smart stepping over Trae Young😂☘️
Trae Young was a better rim protector than Len.
"I'm a Heat fan but Butler is not better than Beal imo. In fact you could place a few players ahead of Butler....Trae Young, John Wall, Middleton, Klay Thompson, I think Bam Adebayo is a better asset than Jimmy...Butler can't shoot 3s, but wins when it counts though. It was the team of the Heat that brought them to the finals. Not just Butler."
"He’s one of the only players I dislike, and it has nothing to do with rivalries. He’s just unbearable to watch manipulating his body to get a foul called every shot. Trae Young is getting on that unbearable list too soon for me.   I get it’s technique or whatever, but it’s just cheap"
God damn I hate Trae Young
Might as well of put a picture of Tacko Fall on this article.  Trae Young mvp picture.   Lmao.  Might not even be an all star this year
Trae young has generated 40 free throws on mid range shots 40 on 3 pointers and only 15 in the restricted area.  League average is players generate 48% of their free throw attempts in the restricted area. Trae Young it’s 10%. The floater area in particular he’s just killing opponents both with the effectiveness of the shot and the flopping to sell the call on those
"Soft. Can’t bump, can’t front a guy off a pick, a big can’t even nudge a cutter through the key now. The rules have changed to allow guys like Luka and co. to get to wherever they want on the floor  with immunity from any physical contact. Soft serve. They had to stop calling fouls for Trae Young as he was taking full advantage. So soft it was making the league look bad."
My worst take?    I only have good takes.   r/NBA and average NBA fans worst takes?    1.  Acting like LeBron doesn’t have a great team surrounding him.  2.  thinking Trae Young contributes much to winning basketball
Remember when people claimed Trae Young is better than Steph Curry?
So Luka and Trae Young? Both of whom are being heavily criticized for it.
(Steph Curry x 0.333) + hairy lollipop = Trae Young
Trae Young
"Lmao I mean maybe at the end of the game but that was the literal end of the game, get the fuck out of here with the dangerous situation with no recourse, he'd be in a the same situation if the game was in the first quarter. If Trae Young really tried to beat up a ref, I really doubt the ref ejecting him would prevent that dumbass. He's going after him because of a call, it's the exact same as why all the other players go after refs.  &gt;	Trae could do whatever he wanted  And how could the ref prevent Trae from doing whatever he wanted during the game? If he tried to fight the ref after the game it isn't like security and everyone around him would be like ""ohno the games over, ref can't eject him, I guess we have to let Trae beat him up"". [The situation is literally no different than other players going after refs.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E--aFgBWogc)"
"I wanna like Trae Young. I like his energy, and he’s entertaining, but something about him just rubs me wrong."
Is Trae young better than Steph?
"He is the best perimeter defender.  That said, the impact Rudy Gobert makes is insane. He doesn’t even have to block it, or have a hand in the face to affect the shot. Grant Williams literally air balled a two footer because Rudy was standing their.   A three contested by Trae Young will be missed more then a layup contested by Enes Kanter. I think interior defense is just more important.  Gobert is a lock in my books for DPOY unless he gets injured or something. This isn’t to disrespect Ben tho, his defense is still incredible."
Carmelo “Trae Young” Anthony with the big play
Dame is just trae young with better hair
"Exactly he was saying how Trae Young is so much better because he has more assists but completely dismisses efficiency and then starts using +/- out of context to ""prove"" that the Bulls play better when Lavine sits lol"
He was saying how much better Trae Young is compared to Lavine
trae young tryna beat me up
"As a 5’10ish white guy, there is no way I would be scared of a guy like trae young. Especially if i’m a 6’5 plus guy with world class athleticism I doubt there would be many players who would generally scare me. I think I thing that made there mindsets and mentalities so Iconic was the fact that they were genuinely intimidating to many people across the league."
"&gt; 4 T/G mitigates the assists though  He has a 2.24 assist to turnover ratio. It's not ideal, but it's not terrible either considering that he's the only playmaker on the team.  &amp;#x200B;  For reference Lebron is 2.1 and Trae Young is 2.16. Harden is a disgusting 2.9, though."
Why cant I just want neither to get hate lmao. Harden is a fucking monster and Trae Young is still great foul-baiting or not
Trae young is far worse. I hope he gets all the hate harden got and more
"Tom Brady: lebron Patrick mahomes: trae young Lamar Jackson: Giannis  Aaron Donald: this could be lebron too, but there is no direct comparison Deshuan Watson: James harden, both really good, and both forced their way out of Houston  Aaron Rodgers: Kevin Durant, great but not better than the king Devante adams:idk Raheem mostart: deaaron fox Derrick Henry: Giannis/embiid Drew brees: Carmelo Anthony  Barry sanders:also Carmelo ig Jamarcus Russell: Anthony Bennett"
"Supertars have nothing to gain but everything to lose. Imagine if a young player such as Tatum, Doncic or Trae Young destroy KD or LBJ. But if the opposite happens, it is no big deal."
Trae Young would like to have a word with Jamal...
"Also, the NBA today doesn't have layers like it once did. Football is like chess and each play can be broken up and analyzing it is very fun.   Years ago the NBA had sophisticated plays. Ball movement was a great thing. Nowadays, plays are instantly finished by guys chucking threes. I honestly don't blame Steph for that. I blame the guys who want the glory like Steph. Dame lillard has literally mirrored his game off Steph. He was a totally different player 3 years ago. He was more like an Isaiah Thomas(pistons) and it was a breath of fresh air. In comes trae young, this guy just chucks 3s constantly. Everybody wants to be like Steph and it's problematic, even for Steph. It takes away from his game.  The league currently doesn't have a true playmaker. I've only seen this from lamelo. Lamelo is gonna be my fave player as long as he makes his main thing playmaking. I'm just tired of everybody chucking 3s.  We need PFs to bring back the mid range. Currently KD is the only star taking advantage of that   The reason why the people in the media talk like this is because the league itself is full of egos. You have guys worrying about THEIR OWN legacy and not the team.  People have always been protective of their players and teams for decades. This ain't new. It's just how it is and NFL is definitely like that.   It's just that NBA is becoming more toxic because the game itself is just watered down. Jamal Murray made 50 points with just 25 shots. That's damn mighty impressive. Let's be honest tho, am I excited, intrigued? No. I'm not because some other fella will do the same in a month.   Adam silver doesn't realize the problem, but it will come to haunt him in a few years. Stars are made from the offensive end. Guys like Clude drezler, Hakeem, magic and bird, Kobe, Jordan, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, TMAC, Tim Duncan, Garnett, Allen, Iverson, Dwade and Anthony, Lebron. All of these guys made themselves household names because of the offensive not defense. It's obvious. Not many people know guys like Tony Allen who is the greatest defender, top 5 in league history, imo.   Not many players were known to be amazing offensive threats, this led to each time having stars of their own or underdogs (04 pistons). If you have a good majority in the league that are offensive threats then you will not have as many stars as you hope. The NBA made this mistake by taking the big man out of the game. The big man was an amazing piece of the game that had to be removed in order to speed up the offense.   I don't know about you younger fellas. Watching Penny and Shaq in the 90s was the most entertaining piece of Basketball I've ever seen. It was insane.  Steve Nash and the Amare duo was crazy too. The spurs and their ball movement was amazing.   The NBA needs to make a transition over the next few years. They need to start bringing the big man back. That's literally what's missing from the game. That is the reason why it feels so bland and empty honestly. If everybody chucks 3s, then they're not exciting anymore."
same people who think Trae Young shooting 36% from 3 makes him an average shooter lol

"""Your honor, I dont do defense""  -trae young probably @ his deposition."
"No. He is not.   Trae Young is a net negative on defense literally all of the time. When LBJ is tuned in on the defensive end, he’s one of the most effective players defensively in the league. When he’s not, he’s fairly average. Embiid is not the greatest defender to ever live, so the gap between him and LeBron is not as significant as you’re saying it is."
I mean no but he’s Trae young on defense compared to embiid’s ability on that end of the floor
"It was a Curry/Dame heat check. Those are the two guys that make those. Murray when he’s on is close, same with Trae Young."
Colins only has a 12 mill cap hold which = Snell’s expiring so this would free up that money BC the hawks are right at the cap right now. Gallo’s shot might get better but he is a bigger liability on D than trae young and that’s a huge problem
"&gt;He scored 71 against you the last two games  I think we found the source of his anger.  in all honesty, I don't mind Trae Young, he does make some really special plays on the offensive end.  but I would not want him on my team, I'm not really sold that he plays winning basketball."
Embiids been better but Lebrons not exactly Trae Young on D
The Anti Trae Young
Yeah and Trae Young thinks Steve Nash is the GOAT. Players dont always know best.
"Yeah, I have to agree. How do refs miss that shit but call the soft shit that Trae Young gets all the time?"
Neither can trae young....lol
So WTF is Trae Young doing? He loses the ball and then doesn't even bother getting back on defense? Not even a light jog. Fuck him. Shitty ass loser who is never going to win anything with that type of deposition.
Alternate title: Trae Young losing the ball and deciding defense isn't for him
Trae Young Kramer
"That arguably was last year when Lavine averaged 25/4/4. This year the team doesn't have a completely shit record (We would be much higher. We're literally the 4th seed if refs didn't fuck us end of game against Portland and the Warriors). Then we have like 7 games where we lost by less than 4 points and a bunch of injuries to starting players. We're actually not as bad as our record makes us look, which is to say that Lavine deserves it over someone like Trae Young"
"Does Ali G know the name of everyone he interviews? No, and that makes it funnier.   Frankly, it's not Inside the NBA's job to make the NBA popular. It's the NBA's job to do that. Shaq isn't the reason that Trae Young shoots 15 FTs a game, and Chuck isn't the reason that Popovich says stuff like ""I don't need to watch the game, I can just look at the stat sheet and see who made more 3s, to find out who won.""   Inside the NBA's job is to get people to watch Inside the NBA, and Chuck &amp; Co are great at doing that. It's not their job to fix the NBA, or to act like it's perfect when it ain't."
worse. Trae Young couldn't get his shadow in front of him
Trae young gets 2 FT's for that
haha trae young bad give me upvote haha
Trae Young literally killed a man
Frequency.     https://soaringdownsouth.com/2019/08/22/atlanta-hawks-trae-young-faced-5th-double-teams-nba-last-season/
Great argument. Boiling down Ben Simmons v. trae Young with a Mike Conley v Steph Curry in 2015 analogy. Shamefully stupid lmao.
"Lol Trae Young is a much, much better offensive player than Ben Simmons. It’s not even remotely close."
"i don't think you've watched a single Trae Young game if you think he's overrated as a facilitator   they have a top 4 offense when he's on the floor, literally 30th when he's off   he's over 9 assists a game and also leads the league in secondary assists"
"Worse. Much, much worse.  Trae is very overrated as a facilitator, and his defense is just atrocious. That team doesn't need somebody to dribble around and score 40. They need people who do the little things and get others involved. That's what Simmons does.   The fit isn't perfect. If he could just become an adequate spot up shooter, he'd be much much more impactful offensively. But Ben Simmons is miles ahead of Trae Young as a basketball player."
"Don’t look at just record, Philly has been great in close games while mil has been awful.  They’re not in different tiers as teams imo though yes ik Philly has had plenty of injuries that hurt their mov numbers.  Still Middleton is a significantly better playmaker with comparable scoring numbers and is the 2nd guy on a top 5 offense while Harris is imo the 3rd on a worse offense(still think Simmons does more even though he scores less).  Defense doesn’t matter too much when comparing the guys.  Bam ofc is an even more obvious choice and only 1/4 guys took trae young."
Some of Bens advanced defensive numbers are nearing Trae Young levels
Yeah tbh I think part of it is teams still arent smart about how they attack bad defenders. I remember last year seeing all these Josh Richardson post ups vs Trae Young just fundamentally useless. It's like how teams try posting up James Harden instead of exploiting him off ball in transition and in help defense/rotations.   Think for that series I might kind of ditch Danny Green and start Shake Milton. Make Trae either guard Shake in pick and rolls or especially Seth coming off screens. Because Trae is a bad enough defender still where even for a guard he alone if you go at him right can make it significantly harder for a team to field a good defense when he's on the court.
"I used to think Harden was a Trae Young 2021 type of player 5 years ago who relies on refs to get him good angles to shoot (the whole unguardable narrative and how people started guarding him from behind). Now that I actually watch every game he plays on the nets instead of a reel of bad ref call highlights, the dude is a bonafide superstar with good passing vision, shooting AND durability."
No this is bullshit. Fucking straight bullshit. Who the fuck does Kyrie think he is? He ain’t no Trae young or Derrick white. Dude needs to be humbled.
"That doesn't even make sense. There's an answer to ""who's the better defender Trae Young or Isaiah Thomas"" (btw the answer is IT)."
Lavine deserves it over trae young this year which is a name that folks have been throwing around.
That’s what Trae Young did last year lol.
I do watch the bulls -  The bulls are +7.3 when Coby white plays and Zach Lavine doesn’t.  They are +6.8 when Zach Lavine just doesn’t play.  No impact metric has Lavine close to being ahead of brown or Trae young either
Nah.  Guys like Beal and Trae would be up there too with those guys.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/soaringdownsouth.com/2019/08/22/atlanta-hawks-trae-young-faced-5th-double-teams-nba-last-season/amp/
"ehem  Davis Bertans is also on Trae Young level, thankyouverymuch"
Luka defense is fine! No where near trae young. Korkmaz n duncan robinson r prolly on trae young level
I wonder who was still giving Luka that many votes after all the stupid foul drawing and complaining to the refs he's been doing this season. No disrespect to the man's game but him and Trae Young sometimes are just boring to watch. The game stops every minute because they're jumping into defenders and getting free throws.
Ihmmmm   What about someone named Trae Young and their hair?
Any player that averages 29ppg should not be left off the all star team  if you wanna argue wins or defense then Trae Young shouldn’t have made it  But Beal just wasn’t as popular last year
Trae young fuck boi
"Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo would be the notable omissions from your list."
Are we to assume from how you worded this that you are not bothered by the way Trae Young is officiated?
Really thought Curry would've been first. The Trae Young hate is hilarious though
"Dame probably flops the most in the league on 3pt attempts, maybe just behind Trae Young. He does the off-screen flop more than any other player."
And fans do it differently lol?   Trae Young was a starter last year whole Beal didn't make the all Star game.
"And that clearly is not actually relevant when it comes to all star voting based on your logic. Again, refer to Trae Young, so what exactly are we talking about? The all star game is a popularity contest, that's more dependent on voting and the opinions of others rather than individual and team performance.  This is an obvious truth, so to get worked up about your favorite player not being a starter, or someone being picked over them is fruitless when the entire system needs to be changed. Again, fruitless, pointless, petty and insignificant when it comes to actual basketball that matters"
"Stats wise aren't they just about the same but with Luka almost averaging a triple double? And are we really holding their team record against them now? So by that logic Bradley Beal shouldn't be considered for the game either since both of their teams are in the negative. And objectively certain players will make the game regardless of record.  Guys like dame, steph, LeBron, AD, etc. could all be on teams with a less than .500 record but still make the all star team easily. Look at Trae Young making the starting lineup last year on a bottom feeder tea.. for fucks sake.So winning basketball isn't as relevant as you seem to think it is. Unless we're talking about non-supererstar players. Thats a bad argument."
Well you have Bradley Beal this year who is playing for the 9-17 wizards. You also had Trae Young who started despite playing for a low seeded hawks team.
"IMO one Celtic should get it, I'd go probably with Brown given Tatum has missed more time. Simmons and Trae are interesting fiddles. Does Simmons previous experience weigh it for him. And, do coaches just hate Trae young this year lol. I hope Jaylen makes it though he's a top tier fun player for me."
"Trae Young: fan rank 6, player rank 11  Ben Simmons: fan rank 11, player rank 6  Interesting"
"At the same time your responses are serious, so I can't really be wrong here. If you mean to be sarcastic in your post, it isn't obvious. If you mean to be sarcastic in your comments, it's even less obvious. There's nothing that oozes irony in any part of this post, you're just playing dumb and trying to deflect. Bro, seriously. Do you think Manute Bol should've been nicknamed Blockboy?      Why don't we nickname everyone similarly?   Lebron James - Chasedown Blockman   Shaq - Bigman   Trae Young - StephCurryman   Steph Curry - Bigshootman   Karl Malone - BoyTouchingman   Kawhi Leonard - Boardman"
"Yeah but there’s more than two guards spots available. I think it’ll come down to Brown,Lavine or Trae Young with one of them being left out"
"You do realize that you don’t disqualified for playing on a good team, right? The only reason Beal has more ppg than Kyrie is because his team sucks, and outside of that Kyrie does everything better than Beal.  It can’t be understated that someone like Trae young is still a massive positive when he’s on the floor, while Beal is a negative."
"All star doesn’t even go by wins though, trae young was all star starter and the Hawks were bad."
"It would have a huge effect on some marketable players that the NBA promotes, I.E. Trae Young and other small guards. If Trae is no longer effective and loses All Star nods, the NBA will see it as a bad thing. In general a lot of people find the play of small guards to be entertaining, you can't take away one of their most reliable tools and risk their effectiveness decreasing."
That's not Trae Young
It honestly could happen. I'm not sure the phrase carrying your team to an almost .500 record is a phrase that should really ever wow someone.  And Trae Young has even more of an iffy case
"He also averages 11.3 FTA a game, more than twice Jokic. Shit it's more than Trae Young too. Harden has only 1 season averaging more."
"Kawhi Leonard averaged 31/9/4 on 62%TS over an entire postseason. He carried a team over an elite 76ers defense with Simmons, Embiid, and Butler. In the postseason, he has the handle, the midrange game, and the three point shot to stay consistent.  He's a career 40% 3 point shooter in the playoffs. Kawhi's free throw attempts in his past 3 playoffs have been 8.5, 9.0. and 7.2 attempts per game. His career True Shooting Percentage is actually higher in the playoffs.  Having a complete offensive game is so undervalued for star players. You need to be able to find multiple ways to score and put pressure on the defense and limit your mistakes. Kawhi does all of that to perfection. For such an elite playoff performer, I don't think its fair to give it to Trae Young, whose never played in the playoffs and has some holes and questions to the consistency of his offensive game."
I can't believe the foul call on Trae Young.
I thought it was a Trae Young nickname
Kawhi. Trae Young is immensely talented but fuck him and his style of play. Ruining basketball.
"I'm sure he's a nice dude, but I fucking hate Trae Young."
"Every year there's a handful of stars that can't even get to the playoffs despite being called stars. That's never a concern with the Heat. People can use the 'we get good players' excuse all they want, but if Spo had KAT, NO AD, Sac DMC, Brad Beal, Trae Young, etc., there'd be no chance we'd be struggling to make the playoffs for a decade like those teams do.   Its easy to just say 'well they have good players' and then forget the teams with good players that constantly screw it up, year in year out."
"Worst defender in the NBA is Trae Young and it’s not even close. Plus MPJ has a lot of room to grow as a defender, and he probably will."
"Eh it definitely wasn't far off. But also he's new to the league, it was always gonna take a while for people to turn on him (like it takes people to go from loving Giannis to the takes of ""playoff choker"" ""only good at one thing"" etc.) Established stars get more hate, it's how it goes.  Half the thread would be people rinsing him for his foul baiting and whining, whilst the other half was people going ""imagine if this was Harden"" ""imagine if this was Trae Young"" ""Luka doesn't get abuse because he's white"" etc etc.  End of the day, they're all awful for it and they've all been getting called out for it."
It's not really difficult. Trae Young is doing the same things Luka and Harden do. They accelerate and decelerate with the ball while moving toward the basket to catch a defender bumping into them from the side or from behind.
"Without rings... what makes Magic better than trae young!  trae can shoot from 30ft!  He scored close to 30 a game last season!  He gets to the line! He can dribble!  drive!  dish!    Aside from hair, Trae &gt; Magic    /s"
"Imagine if Trae Young got fouled like this. He'd be in the upper deck and when he finally made it down back to the court, he'd be taking 20 technical free throws."
Trae Young a bitch
No it isn't. All NBA heavily favours winning. Why didn't Trae young make it over CP3 last year? Literally everything you've said so far is wrong
Exactly it’s a really weird situation. Surely you would have to ask Tatum and Brown what they think before doing it. Smart means so much to the team. A backcourt of him and Trae Young is legit
Him and Curry should book the 2 for 1 Trae Young taught Foul Baiting Class special.
I don't think it's that complicated. We're putting multiple fringe-NBA players on the court at the same time for long stretches. We had Javonte Green as our primary defender on Trae Young. We're playing 11+ players when we have 3 rotational players injured because we're searching for any signs of life from our bench.
[Trae Young is...](https://tenor.com/view/soft-gif-11015107)
This is the reason ratings are down. Not politics. Not Covid. Not the skill level. The overall product of the league allowing this shit and the refs blowing the whistle. Shit is so watered down. I’m sorry but there is no way Trae young should be getting to the line as much as he does. Embiid does the same shit but you can say he is at least getting fouled because he’s such a load. It’s unwatchable
Ofc it was a Trae Young play 💀
Trae young is fucking shameless to start to complain about not getting that call. Are you fucking serious.  How can anyone defend this behavior from him?
Now contrast this with Trae young last night.
so? Trae Young is the best player on the Hawks and that doesn't magically make him a top-10 defender.
"Fine trae young already, this is actually disgusting to watch."
"Trae Young is good for the NBA, bad for basketball."
Meanwhile on the front page right now is Trae Young getting a foul call by barely being touched.   It's ridiculous.
There’s a lot worse that goes on in the league then Trae Young shooting it because he felt some contact. It comes back to poor officiating and giving players those calls. This is hardly one of the most egregious examples and certainly not one that’s so exceptional he needs to be roasted for it.
Trae Young is a bitch. His only NBA-level skill is shooting free throws and he knows it.
And he goes by Trae cause he's Rayford Young III
Yeah I'm sure I'm going to get an impartial opinion on this from TRAE-YOUNG-BETTER lmao. He pulled up in front of the defender and even cracked him in the face lol. FVF got T'd up for that exact move last week
Hope trae young doesn’t shoot a single free throw so these nephews on this sub can stfu about him only being good because he foul baits
Trae Young frying the Cs is gonna give Bill Simmons an aneurysm
"Surprised no one has trae young on this list, hes basically got the points and assists locked down, he is only a 1 steal per game guy though so youd hope for growth there"
"If that's your argument then why does Vuc deserve All-Star over Trae Young?  Trae's raw stats are better, advanced numbers are similar (very good offense with poor defense), and same talent argument could be made for talent with Hawks injuries, and record is a .5 game better than the Magic right now."
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Team success as always been apart of all-star reserve selections when splitting hairs.   Look at Bradley Beal last year and Trae Young this year.   At some point you have have impact winning and reward the teams for winning games. Not having an all-star from a top 4 seed in your conference is a bad look imo.   I would also argue that if Sabonis were on the Magic his stats may even been better bc he would get more usage but that's just speculation.
"Not saying he's bad or that he won't be a great player, but Jason Tatum is viewed as a second-tier superstar and before the season started people saw him in the 10-15 range. I fail to see how he's considered that much better than players like Trae Young or Zach Lavine."
bad news for trae young
"You can’t make everyone happy. Booker will probably replace Anthony Davis and make the all star team.I would have picked him over CP3, but it’s very close. Sabonis,Trae Young, Derozan, Middleton are all having all star caliber seasons, but the competition is great. I feel bad for Sabonis, but who are you supposed to take off the all star team then? They all deserve it. I think they did a good job picking the reserves."
"Okay, then leave out the RAPTOR, he's still an all-defense caliber 20ppg scorer with a TS% of .55%. Out of the eastern conference guards, he is probably the second biggest snub after Trae Young."
Refs should be praised for not calling BS like that. The players have been given way too much rope for “drawing” fouls and expecting they get called. It has to stop.  I watched 48 minutes of the Hawks the other day. Holy hell is Trae Young unbearable to watch. I thought Harden and CP3 were touch watches a couple years ago but the shenanigans have clearly gone up a level and are more widespread than ever.
"I like Fred’s game a lot, but it’s hard for me to see why he should get in over Trae young or Khris Middleton, hell even guys like Gordon Hayward or Malcolm Brogdon who are both putting together really good starts to the season and I don’t think got even a passing mention as potential all stars."
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"Because he's one of the worst defender in the league and he's not as good as Steph/Lillard/Harden on offense  He's ranked as bottom 10 defender in 5 year DRAPM (out of 900+ players)  only guys worse than him are players like Jamal Crawford, Trae Young, Isaiah Thomas or Malik Monk"
"Yeah and Randle is averaging 23/11/6, Vucevic 24/11/4, Simmons 16/8/8 with All NBA defense, Tatum 26/7/5, Brown 26/6/4, Lavine 29/5/5, Harden 25/8/11, Trae Young 27/4/9. 22/11/6 is good, but isnt the crazy stat line you think it is."
"I mean, that's a problem with a lot of young stars. Luka does that shit all the time (although a lot less this year) and if he doesn't make those two shots last night, everyone is shitting on him for taking two terrible 3's when he had time to get his team a better shot. Trae will figure it out. I don't like his game a lot of the time, but he's too good of an offensive player to not figure it out and wreck shit."
wtf was trae young thinking?!
"Like Trae Young wasn’t the worst defensive player last year. Or KAT, Kyrie, LaVine, Randle, DeRozan and Kemba the last few years."
Meh Im ok with those guys being snubbed.  The DISRESPECT on Sabonis though. I know the dude has the excitement of a Tim Duncan but that dude puts in work. Im also a Trae Young fan but all the guards in the East deserve their spots.
"FVV: 19.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.7 assists on 40.5-37.7-88.8 shooting  Middleton: 20.3 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.7 assists on 49.8-43.4-89.5 shooting  I'm def taking Middleton  I think some people would even consider Trae Young if we're going another East guard (27.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 9.6 assists on 43.4-37.0-87.7 shooting on obviously far worse defense)"
Trae young is allergic to defense and free throws resulting from legitimate contact.
Trae is too Young and i took Cassell over holiday but i could definitely see it
Trae young
I think Trae Young has the crown now.
"Three of the East starters from last year didn’t even make it this year. Pascal Siakam, Trae Young, and Kemba Walker."
"Kyrie, Curry, Trae Young, Goran Dragić"
     Giannis (26)  Luka (21) wtf this dudes only 21...  \---  Embiid (26)  Jokic (26)  AD (27)  \---       Players that could age well and keep pace:  Trae Young (22)  Bam Adebayo (23)  Bradley Beal (27)  \---  Zach Lavine (25)  Donovan Mitchell (24)  Sabonis (24)  Jayson Tatum (22)  Jaylen Brown (24)
Trae Young is not a snub imo... He's an amazing player but who would you replace?
"If we’re doing current players, then why not include Jrue Holiday, Trae Young,  etc...?"

"Who are you saying didn’t deserve it? Jaylen got in as a guard so Sabonis wasn’t even competing with him, it just would’ve been Trae Young."
Is it just me or is Trae Young particularly blatant with his carries? The NBA needs to start calling some of the more egregious ones
"&gt;Also, would you like him to actually have the ball *less*? That's actually insane.  This is something that all of the young stars have to learn, and its a huge part of what made Zach improve so much this year. It doesn't necessarily mean having the ball less, just letting go of it more often and relocate, cut, move etc. This makes your defender more tired and makes the defense scramble. Which would open up the game a ton for him.   You are not well coached though, and this mostly has to do with coaching. We had to move from Boylen to Donovan in order for Zach to learn this. Going back even further it was Phil Jackson who taught Jordan this before he became a champion. Y'all need to get rid of Lloyd Pierce and get a competent coach that can teach Trae how to play winning basketball."
Trae Young is 🙌🧻🙌🧻🙌🧻
Trae young starter to snub.
Hawks traded Doncic for Trae Young
"No. Luka simply had bad streak and wasn't prepared to NBA early in season. Because there was no off season.  Literally from same period take even someone like Trae Young numbers. Early on Luka shoot bricks while Trae hit crazy amount of 3s. Then it changed, Luka got into it rhythm and Trae had terrible streak.   This cherry picking must stop. It doesn't help anyone. It creates fake narratives. But media loves them because it creates good clickbait titles.   The same thing is with ""clutch shooting players"". As example. Take Michael Jordan and DeMar DeRozan. MJ is considered best clutch shooter even meanwhile DeRozan considered one of biggest choker. But when you look at statistics, they are clutch with same hit %. Even Jimy created video about this ""clutch shooting myth""."
"I didn’t say he was a good defender I said he was getting better(which he is). I understand your point about VORP being cumulative and when I made this post I was treating it like WAR for baseball, where everyone gets an equal chance to bat, but now that I think about it, Trae Young can be used more and get more VORP because of it. I was not fully thinking this post through and although there is a case for Trae certainly I’m not tryna stir up drama over something like this so I’m gonna delete this post. Thanks for helping me reach this realization"
I got called a hater last year when I said that Trae Young being an all star starter was a travesty. Glad that the ppl realize that he doesn't deserve it now
"Stats are improving for defense? Dude is still last place among all point guards for defensive rpm. VORP is also a stat you accumulate throughout the season, that just means Trae Young played more than those guys because he's been healthier. Points/assists matter less since we understand usage rating. Dude is in top four and the three guys above him are Giannis, Luka, and Harden.   Dude is a great player and certainly has a case, but these are just bad man."
Devin Booker over Paul George  Trae Young over James Harden
Wait but last season didn’t Trae Young make it as a starter averaging 30 points on like the second worst team in the league? So I guess that doesn’t matter for some people either lol
"Dude, listen Trae Young put up stats that are better tan these other guys, if we’re judging by team performance, then other players become involved and we are no longer measuring individual performance"
Trae young is a BUM
VORP isn’t a perfect stat. Trae Young does not have more value over a replacement player than any of the guys you just mentioned.
That record argument is so stupid. All star is an individual award not a team award. If it was all about the record why did Trae Young make the all star team last year despite being on one of the worst teams in the league.
dat trae young defense tho
It's unfortunate that Trae will always be tied to Luka because Young is a very good offensive player
"1. Saying simmons not being able to shoot is equivalent to Trae not dunking is stupid. A layup is worth as much as a dunk, but a dunk isn’t worth as much as a three point shot. 2. FVV isn’t as skinny as Trae, and he also has great instincts on defense. He’s older than Trae, and therefore is also has had more time to put on muscle and get stronger. Trae will never be a good defender, I was simply saying it’s easier for large humans to be good defenders while young than smaller ones."
So you don’t think Trae Young deserved to be in the all star game last year?
It’s a damn good team. Trae young would be the best backup in history lol
You asked for a downvote.  Now you are whining about it like Trae Young.
"Trae Young leads Ben Simmons in PPG (by 11 ppg), APG, same TS%, PER, win shares, offensive win shares, BPM, OBPM, and VORP.   He’s top ten in PPG and assists.   Using your logic, shouldn’t Trae be in over Ben ? The team success shouldn’t trump everything else right ?"
Damn you remember my thread?   I feel honored.   Trae Young is a whiny bitch just like his fans.
Good. Fucking hate watching Trae Young play. Baby James harden the way he works the referees. Fuckin terrible watching that prick flop about on a nightly basis.
Skip is happy right now. Trae Young missed out on the ASG for some reason he doesn’t like him either
Is Trae Young the ultimate zoomer star? Dude is all flash with no intangibles. Plays no defense. Same size as Lillard but can't even lead his team to a top 10 seeding in the East yet every Zoomer on twitter and Reddit thinks he is an all star snub.
12 fts? LMAO TRAE YOUNG GAME Stephanie Curry floppy disk bitch.  -box score watcher
"Makes no sense how Ben Simmons gets into the all star game but Trae Young gets snubbed on his home turf, absolutely ridiculous"
"There’s plenty of playmakers better than Simmons, including non point guards and pure point guards. You might as well just say he’s top ten in assists. Well so are Westbrook, Draymind, and Trae young, all non all stars"
And the L. Is there a more Trae Young game?
"Yeah Luka isn't a great defender, but trae young is a black hole on defense and is constantly targeted. You seriously downplaying that part?"
"Trae Young with the matador defense, and what is Gallinari doing with the"" ""Help"" defense?"
I'm fine with it but I don't understand why people act like there's such a big difference between him and Trae Young.      |WL|Player|G|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|FTA|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|PTSV| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |14-14|Luka Doncic|28|.474|2.4|7.3|.333|8.3|.773|8.6|9.3|1.0|0.7|28.8| |13-15|Trae Young|28|.439|2.4|6.2|.379|10.3|.885|3.9|9.5|0.9|0.3|26.9|
"As a fan i'd like to see some of these guys play. The All NBA / All Defense Teams are about awarding people. All Star Game is more about being fun.   Some guys left off, that definitely could be fun if they were involved. And Conley constantly getting left off through his career.  * Trae Young * DeMar Derozan * Domantas Sabonis * Tobias Harris * Devin Booker * Mike Conley * De’Aaron Fox"
"Oh, so this is just another Trae Young hate thread then lol."
You think that Trae Young is good enough to do what only Steph Curry and Isiah Thomas did in being the best player on a championship team as a small PG? Give me a break.
Why do people complain about snubs but don’t say who doesn’t deserve a spot? Kendrick perkins for example. Theres a limited number of spots and i dont see anyone that Trae Young or Sabonis should clearly replace
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
I'd have to imagine trae young isn't all that popular with coaches
Trae young is truly unwatchable
Here's some mental gymnastics for you:  Ben Simmons is a better basketball player than Trae Young
"The injuries with this team are unbelieveable.  We now have the worst bench in the NBA again and are down two/three starters from last year if this turns into a longterm issue.  Anyone who projects this Hawks record as a failing on Trae Young is either an idiot or is making an argument in bad faith.  Trae was just out there with Tony Snell, Skylar Mays, Okongwu, and Kevin Huerter in the early half of the 3rd quarter"
"Disagree. Shai, De'Aaron, Demar, Middleton, Sabonis, and Young are probably not good enough to be all stars. Neither is CJ or Wood.  Other ones have arguments but it is OK to have snubs. The spots being limited is what gives them value. If you expand them the value is reduced and will eventually cause you to re-examine who might be considered a ""snub"" from the reduced-value all-star selection.  Finally, the strongest argument yet against expanding the selection is that it just doesn't make sense to have a rotation of more than ten guys on each team. It will just take away time from players we actually want to see, in order to what? Get De'Aron Fox and Trae Young minutes?"
"if Vucevic is getting an All star spot, I don't see why Trae Young doesn't deserve one. He will likely get in as a replacement (just like I think Devin Booker will). But yea, that's the only gripe in these. Otherwise, the rest of the picks seem fine."
"&gt; Booker   &gt; Beal   &gt; SGA   &gt; Trae Young  Notice a pattern here? Those are all guards, they have different competition for ASG spots than bigs do.   If you want to argue that the AS team should just be 12 position-less players, fine. But as of now, it's not. Sabonis and Vuc don't compete with Curry and Harden for AS spots, while the 4 guys you listed do."
Trae Young is one of the worst 5 defenders in the league by almost any stat you sort for a player with comparable minutes. Coaches love defense. They left Booker out for the same reason
"Bruh, trae young went from all starter to not making the all star game lol.the amount of snubs is insane"
The coaches pick the reserve players and coaches love defense. Trae Young is one of the worst 5 defenders by stats. Booker is one of the worst 10. Sort by 800 minutes https://craftednba.com/player-traits/sieve
"Nobody. I don't like Trae Young. I can see where people could argue he belongs there in place of plenty of guys. I can also see the argument that those guys belong in there over Trae.   It's a perpetual battle between ""This guy is putting up numbers that are ultimately irrelevant"" and ""This guy is doing relevant things on a relevant team.""   I don't really enjoy the all-star game, and I don't really care who makes it."
Without Trae Young the Hawks would be fighting the Pistons for dead last in the conference.
"Trae Young is averaging 27/4/10 on 61% TS on a team with a better net rating than the Knicks or Bulls. This is a historically bad snub.  He's not even a WOAT defender anymore, he's just regular awful"
Trae Young is averaging 27/10 this year and still can't get a spot in his hometown game.
I doubt nba coaches are the biggest Trae young fans
It’s actually hilarious. Coaches won’t vote Trae young as an all star but send two people to double him at half court.
How the actual fuck is Trae Young not an all star?
Trae young is probably the most disrespected player in the league honestly
Snubbing Trae Young when the game is in Atlanta.  Head scratcher.
"Trae Young this season: 26.9 ppg, .439 FG%, .379 3P%, .506 eFG%, 10.3 FTA, 3.9 trb, 9.5 ast, 0.9 stl, 4.3 turnovers a game.   Zach Lavine this season: 28.6 ppg, .518 fg%, .434 3p%, .607 eFG%, 5.4 fta, 5.4 trb, 5.1 ast, 1.1 stl, 3.8 tov.   And the bulls have a better record. So what’s your argument?"
"LaVine deserved it last year too, for what it's worth, especially over Trae Young"
It was probably Trae Young with that rat king on his head.
Lol over trae young and Sabonis hell even kris Middleton....you need to watch what liquor you putting in you’re cup lol
"Please. Stop. Booker was playing with legit garbage for years and was getting snubbed. The coaches have NEVER factored that in. Look at Beal last year. Look at SGA this year. All these players have faced ridiculous defenses and consistently been snubbed off the list. They never got extra points for playing with bad teams.  Winning has always mattered. Trae Young didn’t even make the list, look at his numbers."
"will all due respect, fuck them and fuck Trae Young"
"Contrary what this subreddit thinks, Trae Young should had made it"
"I mean, the All Star roster hasn't been expanded in fucking ages, and for Sabonis, Bam, Trae Young, Booker, Jimmy Buttler, Brandon Ingram, DeRozen, etc, all not to make it? This season has been a mess due to covid, and by time the year is over, many of these selections will look straight up silly."
It’s insane he got picked over Trae Young. There’s no standard here.
Why are we acting like Trae young didnt average 30 points and 10 assists with almost nobody else on his team?  That plus being flashy enough for fans got him in lol
Then why no Trae Young lol
"That thread explains the legality/illegality really well.  That rule absolutely needs to change. ASAP.   Maybe once every team has a trae young type threat taking advantage, Silver and co will be forced into it."
Curry is a given  Luka eats bbq  Dame eats salmon   Joel eats cheesesteaks  Tatum eats chowder  Booker eats kendall  Giannis eats gyros   Knicks only eat food from bodegas   Trae young munches on ice cubes while twirling his hair
"Celtics fanbase is enormous and Trae Young is the only player on the Hawks worth getting a jersey of.  I imagine sales for the Suns would be a little more spread out with Booker, Paul, and Ayton."
Bruhhhhh. Fuck that mf trae young.
"How can anyone watch Luka and Trae young regularly and think they do foul baiting as much ?  Everyone in the league does it , Trae is getting the most criticism because he does it the most , where is the hard part to understand ?"
"FVV is definitely better on offense than Hunter, but Hunter is a top 10 defenseive player in the entire NBA according to RAPTOR (he's number 8 overall), and FVV and OG are 33 and 36 overall, respectively. Hunter also guards 1-5, but, like OG, he is only effective in guarding 1-4 and smaller 5s. You also have to remember that he, along with the rest of our defense, is typically making up for the net negative that Trae Young is on defense.  I'm not trying to say he is better than any of the three, just making my case that he should *at least* be considered as good as they are this season"
"Simmon's uniqueness makes it hard to evaluate him. The strengths with him tracking guys in transition and hitting them for spot up 3s are obvious players 3 point rate and %s with vs without him speak for themselves. He's tall and obviously throws a number of high level passes. But then on the other hand he has the same issue these DeRozan and Jimmy Butler non shooter types also have they dont get teammates shot attempts at the rim. Simmons also turns the ball over too much often needlessly and isnt the type of aggressive passer a Jokic/Trae Young type is. Where does that leave you.....I think Ben had it right putting him more in the honorable mention category.  In general when in doubt I lean more towards the idea of evaluating playmaking more than this idealistic notion of passing. Your overall skill set and potential limitations matter that's what defines your impact. The hardest part to evaluate is probably the opportunities that are available that players dont see and passes they dont make, simply because you cant watch every game of every player you have to use a selective sample to evaluate that"
"Who's making that argument lol? The Hawks would be fucking stupid to trade JC for beas at this point. They can wait til the off-season to match any offer he gets in FA or do a sign and trade so there's no rush to move him, and our GM is trying to make the playoffs so that he can keep his job. Schlenke also would probably want to see JC and Trae play under a competent HC for a while before making any decisions. Also where does Malik fit on our team? We have a lot of young guys getting minutes/developing, adding another guard to our lineup makes zero sense unless we made other trades."
"Other than Trae and Capela with their natural chemistry, under LP the lineups on the floor consistently looked like it was their first time playing together.  Nate has done wonders for helping this team filled with very young stars and newly acquired vets finally start to gel."
You would think trae young would take the final shot

He’s the only player that can create offense for himself without relying on Trae Young.   His progression caught the fanbase by surprise to be honest.
"The owner of the team said that... that literally happens all the time especially with top 3 picks....  Edwards, wiseman, ball, zion, ja, rj, Ayton, Luka, trae, fultz, ball, Tatum, Simmons, Ingram, brown,KAT, Dlo, Poringis, etc etc etc  Most top picks get hyped up by thier franchise as a great player... Wiseman was a top ranked prospect who missed his college season and was still picked #2.. he’s good and young so we will see how his career plays out"
"I thought you were talking about Seth.  Wow. It's Steph after all. This just confirms my belief that Steph is a system player of the highest order. Without Kerr's system, he's just a worse version of Trae Young."
Trae Young and Vince Carter
Trae Young and Embiid
Perhaps he could try being less Trae Young-ish.
"Lol at Trae Young trying to celebrate with the ref, thanking him for the 16 free throws"
"This sub loves ignoring great trae young performances. 37 7 5 with the clutch fourth quarter comeback is some superstar shit and yet zero praise for ice trae.   Just sayin, if he put up 12 points every comment would be about how terrible he is. This subs gotta put some respec on traes name when it’s due"
Trae Young is the best playmaker in the NBA rn. Lots of turnovers but that's just because he has the ball all game. He literally could average 13 assists if his teammates hit the threes he gets them off the drive and kick
Trae Young represents everything wrong with NBA basketball today. Draft him in the 90s and he'd be out of the league by now
Trae Young and Harden are not fun to watch.
why are you triple teaming trae young in the paint
Raps just lost to a buzzer beater from a guy uglier than Trae young. Fucking bullshit
Trae young is gonna flop and try to get 3 FTs . Calling it rn
Trae Young is climbing the ranks.
Trae Young /tread
Trae young got as much FT's as he got hair follicles left on his head
This game is porn for Trae Young haters
Bruh I used to see a guy that looks like Trae young at Dundas station every day asking for change. How the hell can you be a millionaire athlete and look like a homeless person
Trae Young top 10 ugliest players in the league currently
" He said this? lol , no one is surprised, Trae Young is a better ball hogger than Harden lmao"
Trae young is the next harden in terms of hate from fans and media.
Trae young playing the ugly game.  Matches his features
Steve Nash was right. Trae Young doesn’t play basketball.
Trae young and the Hawks look like they're mentally weak. Just need to take the lead once and it's GG.
Trae young
Hawks should just trade Trae young and rebuild if they lose this game...raps running a g league lineup lmaooo
"My counterpoint would be Trae Young, for whom no compliment can be given without it circling back around to the defense."
Because the tears of Trae Young fans can cure cancer and there’s a lot of cancer in this world
The 3 anti trae young opinion posts cap would be reached in 15 minutes
"This is basically ""who is famous/who does the media constantly talk about"" with Jimmy Butler, and Trae Young thrown in. Which isn't to take anything away, but it's also not surprising if you've turned on ESPN any given day over the past couple months."
"What a stupid post, top 30 in 3’s on less than 7 3’s = not an elite shooter, but that doesn’t take into context the degree of difficulty and the defensive attrition he gets.   mods should put a cap of 3 anti trae young opinion posts a week."
"I agree. Lonzo is having a great year but Trae fans took this as a slight to Trae and it is what it is. Fun fact, Brandon Ingram is tied with Trae Young for three’s made"
The hawks were bad before the got trae young and have been bad the whole time they’ve had trae young. Come up with whatever stat you want but it doesn’t make that wrong
"Let me say it again. Outside of Trae Young, we don't have a single player on our entire team that can actually make a play. Our second best ball handler / playmaker right now is regular season Rondo. A player with a reputation of not giving a shit in the regular season. Deandre Hunter is just now finally able to dribble and get to his spot, but that's it. Not going to break a defense down with his speed or athleticism."
"Kinda surprised that Booker isn’t on here but guys like Tatum and Trae Young are, wonder if it has anything to do with how terribly stocked the Suns store has been"
"Okay I know he gets a lot of shit, but I still think his defense is overrated: Trae Young.  Yes he’s great on offense, but he has to be the worst defender I’ve ever seen. He literally does nothing. He can’t guard a brick wall most of time, and he puts literally no effort into it. He clearly just wants the ball and that’s it.   It’s why I don’t buy into him as a legit star, because he literally can’t even try on defense and shows no willingness to. I’m not denying his offensive talent, and I understand he’s smaller so he won’t defend that well, but there are plenty of smaller players that have been adequate defenders."
"Ja Morant is almost Trae Young level bad on defense this year on defense. I don't know if its his ankle or what, but he should be a better defender than what he has shown so far."
Trae young is garbage and imma stand by it
I mean tbf this is a pretty funny stat.  At least it's funny salt.  Like Lonzo how tf you gonna let Trae Young out rebound you
"KOC loves to hate on Trae in general. He can’t even give him props like any other young PG without throwing a jab at his defense, which we all know is bad."
"This is narrative at this point, and nothing more.   Either by season's end, he winds up being consistently better than he was pre-bubble, or he doesn't.   The fact that he had a good few weeks, and a less good few weeks  might well be a result of being banged up. It might also just be sample size, opponent quality, and random noise.   We will know more in a few months.   Is it possible he's really made a huge leap? Absolutely. He just turned 24, and by all accounts is a great dude and a hard worker, and has good coaching and some really good teammates.  Is it also possible that he's not really separated himself from the glut of young, talented guards like Donovan and Trae and Shai and Booker and Lavine and DeAaron and some others? Also yes."
"This sub is just kneejerk as fuck, especially with rookies. I remember when Trae Young was struggling at the very start of his career and people were already writing him off as the next Jimmer Fredette. Some just have zero patience.   Unless Warriors get somebody incredible in return for Wiseman, they're better off holding onto him. He has more than enough potential to be a 3rd (possibly even 2nd) option on a contender."
Comparisons to Trae here are impossible to take seriously.  Any young player who can average over 15ppg for a solid week will be deemed better than Trae Young.
"I think a better example for op's question is like draymond/simmons/gobert caliber players in comparison to like a trae young. Those are literally all stars who are known more for their defense. There's really no such thing as a defensive star if they are actually non existent offensively., more like defensive specialist."
"Absolutely. I suppose the long term hope is that Huerter, Hunter and Reddish all become legit playmakers. Hunter was getting there before the injury. Huerter and Reddish need a bit more time. I suppose Bogi was brought in, because it's clear that the young players still need more time to develop, and we needed consistent offensive backup for Trae on a campaign to make the playoffs."
"He might be sort of like Trae Young, but without the 3 point shot.  He would shoot a low percentage but be effective when he is getting a lot of cheap foul calls, but ineffective when he isn't getting the calls."
Awesome.  Trae Young is still immeasurably better than him though.
"&gt;Besides that I mean **I'd take LaMelo right now over Trae Young** &amp; Ja Morant **no question about that""**   LaMelo is basically what a lot of people thought Trae would be coming into the league,  so I guess it makes sense   I don't know about the Ja Morant bit tho KOC 🤣"
All you have to do is compare the upvotes on  “Lonzo Ball has more 3 pointers made than trae young”  And  “Lonzo ball has more 3 pointers made than [a whole bunch of players + trae]
"I’m not sure why everyone in this sub keeps running away from the obvious. In terms of rookie seasons, the only comparable player in recent years to Lamelo would be Luka if we’re just talking about overall production. His skill set projects very well for a player so young and the holes in his game are ones we can expect to improve over time. He easily projects over Ja for me and his defensive potential puts him slightly over trae for me as well."
Seems as if people saw the original post comparing Lonzo to trae young and ran with it....
He's made more 3s than trae young...blows my mind!
I'm not saying he's better than trae RIGHT NOW. But he will be better than trae. His team is good enough to not warrant putting up 30/9 on a 20 win team like trae did last year.  And he's already a better defender than trae young 35 games into his career. Traes frame and size makes it far harder for him to ever become even an average defender in the league.
"&gt; has far more potential  ehhh  &gt; Trae Young is far, far better  definitely, easily, even rookie year vs. rookie year (altho Melo's isn't done)"
"While Trae Young is a better player rn, I’d take Lamelo over him. He’s a better PG, has proven he can play off ball (even though ATL hasn’t given Trae the opportunity to show he can play off ball) &amp; Melo is 6’7 to Traes 6’1.   As for Ja, Dudes at 23% on 3 attempts per game from 3. Maybe it’s a fluke year &amp; he’ll probably improve on that but I have a hard time going with that guy when the Melo since starting is averaging better numbers all around that’s Ja."
"Trae's best teammate in his first season was 21 year old John Collins.  LaMelo has Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward as vets and a few good young players in Monk and Graham and Washington.  Not saying Trae was better as a rookie, but LaMelo is much better positioned to contribute from a supporting cast perspective."
Y’all really hate trae young
"LaMelo is pretty good, don't get me wrong.  However, I personally add Shai, Ja and Trae to the list of young players I would take over him."
"The ringer and disrespecting Trae Young, name a better duo."
"Yeah I'm similar to you. I'll choose which Eastern Conference team I'll bandwagon and change every season.      In the past, to name a few, it's been the George Hill-David West Pacers, the pre-Simmons, Embiid rookie season 76ers, The Wall-Beal Wizards, D'Lo Nets and Trae Young Hawks."
"Sports media &amp; /r/nba Trae hate starter pack: -“worst defender in the league, maybe in history!” ...better defensive rating than Kyrie, Doncic, Lillard, Harden, Zion, Beal -“too small” ...he’s been hearing this his whole life but here he is averaging 30/9 in the NBA. -“doesn’t elevate his team as much as X” ...averaging 9.4 assists (3rd in the league), constantly drawing double teams and defensive attention just past half court. Player X is a rookie that moves off ball well, averages 6 assists, and “elevated” a $30m/yr all-star -“team record is bad” ..half the team has been hurt this year and it’s filled with young players, still a good chance to make playoffs.  Cmon man, you act like some NBA coaching can turn anyone’s jump shot into Steph Curry. If you have ever watched Trae play his passing is elite, like Nash or Kidd level. His shooting is also elite. Both of these are at levels you can’t coach up to. That’s what makes him successful, whether he can fix his weaknesses is to be determined but the dude is a winner."
"Jazz are really really good and no one cares, Lebron is old and very good, Embiid and Jokic are historically dominant, Blake Griffin sad and bad, LaMelo is going to be an all-star for a decade but not allowed to be melo, Trae Young is a pansy, Knicks are an NBA team now, west good east sucks, Westbrook still loses games but everyone likes him now, Nets are the Monstars and KD is still KD, Chef Curry is fucking the sky, Lillard is shooting 42% from the opposite free throw line, Oubre is sexy and can’t shoot, Zion is an all-star, Kyrie is asshole why Lebron hate?"
"Appreciate the post, it's quality content!  One thing I have to point out is the years you have used to get your figures. It would have been better to use the years 1990-2010, so these players had their whole career, providing a true indication of frequency. As an example, most of the following players will be a top 2 player on a playoff team before their career finishes: Trae Young, Brendan Ingram, De'Aaron Fox, Kristaps and Jaren Jackson Jr. I'm sure their are others, these were just the first few that came to mind  Again, awesome post, I really enjoyed it, and would love to see how it looks decade by decade."
You must not got the point about the post yesterday about Lonzo making more 3s than Trae young so far this season
Let's just leave out that Trae Young is statistically better in every category and Young shoots less 3's per game than Ball.
"Trae Young is in the stage of learning how to make the best play every time, which means he’s sometimes making a worse call, because he’s focused too much on making the right Call instead of the simple solution"
"After the injury replacements, I think it's hard arguing there were any snubs at all. FVV certainly didn't get snubbed, because he's not good enough to make the team. Didn't stop the posts on this sub saying he's a huge snub or better than Trae Young, though."
Because he shoots a higher percentage. I said this about Trae Young coming out of college. When I looked at his 3pt %'s and saw they were pretty bad people always had excuses for him. Now he's in the NBA and they are still not great.
"Is he on crack? Trae Young is far, far better than LaMelo Ball and has far more potential."
Trae Young is much better.
"I know people gonna downvote this, but Trae Young is insanely overrated."
"Korver wasn't exactly Trae Young in his prime either. Not every slow, unathletic white guy is a bad defender."
"I just finished my high school basketball season. The Trae Young level flailing isn't really there thank god, of course there was some minor flopping but what can you do that's just basketball. However, *every fucking guard* even at the high school level does that stupid ass ""stop abruptly at half court and get a guy to trip over you"" thing. Idk who started it or where it came from but that shit is so annoying and everyone does it."
Just shows you that he’s gonna be better than Curry. Trae young was predicted to be the next curry and lonzo is better! This is all the proof I need.  Mr “wash my ball” was right
"my trae young conley and aldridge for james harden trade continues to look better, for anyone curious conley and aldridge were FAs in my league"
But Trae Young has jumped backwards into his defenders more!
Because Lonzo is a better 3pt shooter than trae young statistically speaking
"Why are people sayin Trae Young needs to get more shots up and he can’t because of his teammates, I mean doesn’t the man bring up the ball and lead the offense???? You know what I’m sayin? Like he can shoot whenever he wants, maybe he’s just not as great as a shooter we think he’s idk. I believe Lonza has been working hard tho on his shot too tho."
I do NOT like trae young
"Trae Young, game winning buzzer beater from near half court during a preseason game. Just love the stones on the kid."
Lonzo Ball is better than Trae Young and not enough people talk about it.
You think I don't like Trae Young jumping sideways into guys who are trying to close out without fouling...because of Trae's skin color?
"The 2nd year is this season.  Leading in APG with 11.1, he's got a 1.3per game lead on 2nd place (Westbrook).    He also leads in total assists, but only at 345 to 2nd place's 321 (Trae Young, with 3 more gp than Harden).  Harden rarely misses time, so it's very likely he maintains both APG and total assist leader this season"
That’s the twist. We show Trae Young full penetration
Trae Young gets 8 times as many FTs tho
"We're talking about Harden, not Trae Young"
"I agree, Trae Young is going to be a waaay better player than steven im a head coach cause im white nash"
I will pretend I did not see this Trae Young slander
"Look, I think Trae is easily better than Derrick White. But advanced metrics are not a good way to judge defense. Everyone knows they suck. They're only useful combined with the eye test.  Anyone who's watched Derrick White will tell you he's a good defender. Anyone who has watched Trae Young will tell you he is not a good defender. Simple as that."
"I'd rather he be a superstar who gets the right calls and we remove superstar calls. I'm tired of seeing Trae Young(he calmed down in the last few games I watched), Luka(same), Embiid, Harden, Siakam, etc.... look for fouls instead of actually trying to score. Getting both phantom fouls and real fouls.  I think eliminating superstar calls would be the biggest help to go towards more consistent refereeing."
If they really wanted to give Bron the MVP why would they only give him 1 more free throw per game than Nikola? I mean can we at least get to Trae Young levels?

"I think he means in general. Like the original Luka vs Trae debate. I think I part of it is a narrative to keep young guys wanting to play college ball vs overseas, but the idea that euro players are soft has been around forever."
I respect Trae Young.
"I'm a simple man. I see Trae Young make a dumb play or miss a shot, I upvote."
I’ve accepted that this sub will never respect Trae Young it’s just annoying how this post will be extremely quiet where as if he had fucked up in OT it would be trending to front page but you just gotta suck it up I guess
Lol search Trae Young on the search bar on here and tell me this sub thinks he’s good it’s 90% hate
Fuck trae young
Trae Young is ugly af bro
Trae Young hella ugly.
2020 season Trae young basically did that every game. He's used to it.
Who would you rather have: Trae Young or Derrick White?
Trae young was so good in OT also Spurs announcers are amazing
derrick white &gt; trae young
Trae Young scored or assisted on ALL of Atlanta’s points in OT and Double OT
"Trae Young, as you mentioned, definitely qualifies for this."
Trae Young is ridiculous
What a stud Trae Young is.
Trae young my god
"As someone who enjoys watching Harden, the calls Trae Young gets drive me absolutely nuts."
Trae Young can shoot
God I hate Trae Young
"He's not a horrific defender. He's not Trae Young or Kyrie or Kemba.  But he's absolutely not adding value on that end anymore, if he ever was. Peak Russ was an average-ish defender. He's a bit worse than that now, IMO."
Dlo is a homeless man’s Harden on offense and just as bad Trae Young on defense.
Remember when decked Trae Young for Nutmegging him? I think he is most definitely not with the funnies.
Trae Young was seen throwing a party
LeBron is better than Trae Young and it’s not even close
"Those guys love Trae Young so much more than anyone else I've ever encountered, lol"
I heard Danny had Trae Young no 2 in his 23 and under prospect rankings ahead of Zion Williamson a few weeks ago lol.
"All the young stars who came in at 18-19 are going to break the 3 point records  Luka, Trae, probably Booker, etc.   Dame, Steph, and Harden are going to end up being the top 3 in some order and then all the young guys will eventually surpass them"
Trae Young says hi.
Dame Lillard is playing Trae young level defense. It shouldn’t be enough to keep him off first or second team all nba but I’m sorry it’s something that shouldn’t be excluded from consideration for MVP voting. It should dock him. I get all the excuses about him having to shoulder so much offensive load but it’s the mvp race the standards are super high. Other candidates don’t mail it in like he does on defense.   Yes everybody knows nikola jokic isn’t Ben Wallace on that end either and point guard defense isn’t a big deal but still his defense is just a good bit below anybody else’s. It’s been enough of a joke it’s actually had an impact on the court
"I think he's been really overrated. I think he's going to be a solid point guard no matter what, but he hasn't shown any improvement at all in his jump shot or three pointer. He's also a noticeably bad defender. Come playoff time that lack of shooting is going to get really exploited by good defenses and I think it really limits how good he can be. Out of the young guards rn, I have Trae, SGA, Fox, &amp; LaMelo all ahead of him. However, if the shot ever comes along, I think he's the best of that group."
Blocked from the Hawks sub because I said Luka wouldve had a bigger and better impact on the hawks than trae young at this current stage in their careers. Was told I was being toxic again...
Hawks all time team is too deadly  Trae Young  Lou Hudson  Dominique Wilkins  Bob Pettit  Dikembe Moutombo  6th man: Pete Maravich
 Trae Young this year :   \+4.1 OBPM    27.3/75   \+1.4 rTS%    18.1 Box Creation    8.4 passer rating    TOV 10%    119 ORTG when on    \+10.7 net rating on/off
"True but come on...they still arent playing very well. Nobody seems to care about factors like that when mentioning how bad some guys are on defence. Trae Young comes to mind. Of course he looks axtra hideous last year when shouldering a crazy offensive load and having all 1st/2nd players and guys currently out of the league around him. This year with competent people around him he is just regular bad. Point is that any way you slice it guys like Siakam, FVV and Lowry arent playing that great. Siakam is an awesome #3, good #2, Bad #1 option."
"We make fun of Luka dickriders, not Luka... so not really  It’s only like two people in that sub that actually hate Luka and they’re a Hawks/Trae Young fan"
I’m Trae Young on defense and Draymond Green on offense without the basketball IQ.
"Sabonis celebrating a weak overturning of an offensive foul is this season's Trae Young ""it's over"""
"I hate this shit man. People shit on trae young for what he does to draw fouls, but this is just as bad, if not worse."
"Trae Young probably won’t get all nba this year, for 1 it’s rare you get an all nba team without making all star(same reason Bradley put up 30 last season and was ignored), Devin Booker has inferior stats to Kyrie. While games played do matter many people have missed lots of time and still gotten in. Zach Lavine and Kyrie also have pretty even stats, the second factor is Kyrie plays on a winning team"
"it'll depend on how much more time he misses, All-NBA is extremely competitive.  Curry, Luka, Dame, Harden &amp; Beal are all having better seasons than Kyrie is, so that basically leaves 1 guard spot open for Kyrie/Trae Young/CP3/LaVine/Booker/whichever other deserving candidates are slipping my mind right now, all of those guys have a legit case and have played in more games than Kyrie has."
"By the way here's a mind bender for you. Trae Young vs Luka Doncic. Same draft class. Same foul baiting BS. One of them gets shit on relentlessly for it, the other is sucked off like no other with far less hate. Gee I wonder why?"
"Well outside of Spellman, all of those had multiple years in college.  Villanova itself doesnt tend to attract the ELITE prospects in the way that Duke and Kentucky do.  Villanova plays proper team basketball meaning you dont tend to see guys putting up insane stats in the way that say Trae Young did at Oklahoma - Kentucky are similar which is why Devin Booker was picked at 13"

That's just a typical Trae Young play
"Trae Young doesn't even shoot hoops in practice anymore, he just dribbles into mannequins on drawstrings working out how to make it look like they fouled him."
"Someone: Trae Young is a top 5 point guard  You: What? Magic, Nash, Curry, Kidd, and Stockton are all better than him"
"embiid, harden, kyrie, durant, giannis, sabonis, lavine, butler, adebayo, trae young, vucevic, beal, luka, zion, ingram, mitchell, gobert, lillard, jokic, kahwhi, paul geroge, lebron, booker, chris paul, randle, anthony davis, curry. So he's somewhere around 30?"
"Fuck Trae Young, respectfully"
"Remember when we thought that Lou Williams was better than LeBron? Oh, sorry, that was Trae Young and Luka."
"Still Trae would have been worlds better than Mo. I’m not the biggest Trae Young guy, but talent is talent."
"It was a good comeback and I’m happy the young guys are playing well, but I hope we don’t have too many meaningless wins down the stretch. Games like this were the difference between us getting Luka or Trae and getting Bamba."
More efficient and conservative Trae Young
Trae Young could be a 38-40% 3pt shooter if he changed the looks on a lot of his 3pt shots
"I was just joking lmao. But Trae Young has never been a great shooter, he has a career 35% 3pt. He just hits the long threes occasionally that make people think he is a great shooter."
Man I love CP3... He reminds me of a poor man's Trae Young with better handles
"he literally plays because he's annoying as fk lmao the other day he annoyed trae young, now simmons, zach lavine"
"Yeah Lamelo I’d agree is on that level and I could see him being the best passer of the young guards, but I don’t agree that Ja is. Trae is a better overall playmaker to me.  Ja is also a complete non shooter right now, and also a very poor defender. Trae averaged 29 points per game in his second season, Ja is far off from being the scorer that Trae is."
"Not really. Ja is probably a better passer than Trae, IMO. LaMelo is, too. He's also the worst defender.   I'm not saying he isn't a damn good basketball player, I'm saying I don't know that he dramatically changes your team's fortunes if you were to swap any of a bunch of young guards with Trae."
Did you have better assets than Dallas tho? Dallas had a pick ahead of you at 5 and Traded trae young who was the centerpiece of the deal.  You couldn’t have to offered Atlanta trae young as part of your package
Joel Embiid   7’0 280 lbs 37 inch vert  Trae Young   6’1 180 lbs can’t dunk
"It’s fine that people don’t like watching a pump fake into a foul, or waiting for a bump to toss up a shot.  But I’d like to think their are a lot of young basketball players who regularly watch the NBA and are on this sub. They should all be picking up on easy ways to draw fouls, especially the guards. Your coaches will love it. Every young guard with or without athleticism should be watching Trae every time he steps on the floor."
Shame on a 6’0 scrawny guard who doesn’t have the physicals to rapidly increase scoring so he finds other ways to improve his game by mastering drawing fouls that other greats did! FUCK TRAE YOUNG!!!!!!!
Ok as always with these conversations who does he deserve to replace? Is he playing better than tobias Harris or trae young? Both more deserving than Hayward
Looks like Trae Young isn't the only hawk drawing unnecessary contact
"I feel like Trae is not really all that different from so many other offense-first guards. Yeah, the usage rate is insane, but is he really all that different than half a dozen or more other young guards? I kinda count that against all of them, because I see them as somewhat replicable and not really a guarantee of success."
Trae Young
Yeah I had to Google the Trae Young lollipop thing I didn't get it lol  I still like my answer better lmfao
Him and Trae Young have the cringiest takes.
Trae Young
"People said that about Trae Young too. Elite shooting wherever you want on the court, a quick release and skill is a cheat code to a good career. ""Size"" can be a concern but add great vision to the equation and you have a hell of a capable offense talent in the league."
"Positionless basketball though.  Finding talent on the wings is definitely the hardest but I can't specify a single position.  Consider the top ten point guards and compare them to the top ten SGs or SFs and you'll start matching up dudes like Joe Ingles and Kelly Oubre with Jrue Holiday and Trae Young.  Then look at the big men who got bought out.  The wing is the hardest place to find talent for sure, what position you call it is up to you."
"Nah what he said makes sense, being the best rim protector in the league is extremely valuable, it'd be easier to find a young above average guard.  Could probably replace Mitchell with anyone of Ja, Shai, Fox, Booker, Trae, etc and the Jazz would be anywhere from SLIGHTLY worse to much better.  Compared to a potential Gobert replacement who would it be? Turner?"
"I’m not saying he gets as much attention as Trae young lol but that’s not my point.  Trae young gets doubled at half court because he’s a deadly three point shooter. Siakam gets doubled when he drives because thats where he’s best scoring wise. In both situations teams are trying to take away the player’s biggest strength and force them into something uncomfortable.  And yes, Siakam’s handle is much better than OG’s"
"So you are telling me Siakam has that much better a handle than OG? You must be blind! Siakam looks out of control dribbling lots. And again you are blind if you think Siakam is some offensive juggernaut that commands attention. Just watch Trae Young getting full court press doubled 75% of the game and then you will know what ""attention is"""
Trae Young ;)
This would be the ultimate chaos timeline.  Would that mean that people would say Trae Young is good? Would they say instead that harden and Kyrie are bad?
TRAE YOUNG
Then Embiid and Trae Young should be banned from the league
"The year is 20XX. De’Aaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report. The Fox availability metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, the Sacramento Kings, and their army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning championships with the other. The basketball metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so other teams pray Fox is out for the night, and that’s the game.  The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De’Aaron Fox apocalypse. But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox’s raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association’s version of basketball. Try as you will, but 20XX is coming. Or maybe, it’s already here."
i think its disrespectful to mention trae young in the same light as kd harden and kyrie
Posting up will never die so long as it gives us highlights like this:  [Jokic Posts Up Trae Young](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mfhfy4/highlight_jokic_posts_up_trae_young_capela_watches/)
can't wait for these clowns to get swept by trae young
"I don't think it will be either of those guys.  It's gotta be someone with multiple years on his deal, or has ties to Oklahoma/ the Thunder, or is on a rookie scale deal.   Ben Simmons has been in a lot of trade rumors. Jaylen Brown maybe? Trae Young? Brandon Ingram? Deandra Ayton?"
Campazzo is shooting is 37% from the field. He's easily the worst shooter on that team. Yet Capela is on him like he's Ray Allen and poor Trae Young is forced to guard Jokic.   But I couldn't stop laughing when I saw Capela just make a run for it to the rim to try and get the rebound.
"I mean part of it is clearly due to injury recovery, but more teams are beginning to exploit his lack of a 3 pointer/jump shot on offense. It’s why I’ve been lower on him compared to other young guards like SGA, Trae, Fox, &amp; LaMelo."
I felt so bad for Trae Young this game.
lol Trae Young sucks.

"Like, this player isn’t as good at D as Jrue is, but he’s better than Trae Young at defense.  Jrue is one of the best guard defender and compared to one of the worst defender in the league Trae.  It's literally not saying anything at all. lmfao."
"You don’t know what I mean by saying he’s not Jrue Holiday on defense but he’s not Trae Young either? It’s a pretty common way to compare things, you use one great example and one bad example to show where your comparison fits.  Like, this player isn’t as good at D as Jrue is, but he’s better than Trae Young at defense.  It’s no different from saying “I’m not rich (Birdzier’s defense), I don’t have as much money as Elon Musk (Jrue’s defense), but I’m not poor because I have money than that homeless man (Trae Young Defense)”  It’s really not that hard to understand, I don’t get what tripped you up there."
No. He wouldn't even be considered. Rofl.  Idk wtf you mean by &gt;Jurue Holiday but &lt;Trae Young  I can't believe I read this garbage.
Actually Trae Young is a better defender than Deaaron Fox. This is common knowledge
Isn't Trae Young *thee* worst defender in the league? Wasn't that his throne or has he been dethroned
"Trae Young is 5'10"" and weighs 140 lbs. Why wouldn't you help?"
"I watched them all season man, they weren’t a good shooting team, you know whose worse? The teams that the aforementioned players played for. AST/TO ratio is one of the best translators to nba passing success. You hardly ever see top players with a negative value unless they are scorers. If you are elite playmaker you put your guys in position to score. That Trae Young OU team was one of the biggest carry jobs I have ever seen and that OkSt team was way better on both ends yet Trae was the NCAA leader. The OSU team with DLo was atrocious and he isn’t even considered a top nba playmaker, yet backpacked them all year as a FR. He was overrated as a playmaker coming out of high school because of his prep team."
Trae Young
Why can’t it be the older generation hating? I see that as more likely esp on Reddit. Trae young represents a further change in the direction of the league that most basketball “boomers” don’t like
Trae Young
I'm going Zach Lavine or Trae Young.  Those streaky shooters on teams who may need them to launch threes as part of a comeback are always a good bet.

"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
Lonzo ball &gt; Trae young
They're really not that far and Trae is still really young. They do need another star to put next to Trae though.
"Bucks are legitimate contenders right up there with the Sixers. Celtics are a piece away, heat last year was a fluke imo. Love herro and butler but that’s just my belief.   Trae Young is an offbrand Lillard. Less efficient, smaller, less athletic."
I get your joke. I was just adding some analysis in case some idiots actually think the Hawks ever would have a chance winning a ring with the bum Trae Young.
"he's also missing his floater more this year and long distance shot is not as consistent this year either, which really fucks with his ability to drive. If those two are not falling then his other poor qualities like defense and turnovers really come out. Case in point his OPRM is just a little over 4 this year and last year he led the NBA with 7.14, next closest was Steph Curry at 5.9.   Main point, it's been a weird year for the Hawks for a lot of reasons, and I'm not going to take Trae Young slander using real plus / minus on a shitty team last year and a weird season overall with stupid young 20 year old turmoil, injuries from our three best defensive wings, and coaching problems."
Lol Trae Young is easily our best offensive player. What are you talking about? He damn near averaged 30/10 last year.
Trae Young gets outplayed.   Not news.
"Oh no! Trae Young played bad and the thread gets upvoted, whatever will we do! This is such a catastrophic event that totally doesn’t happen with every player!"
Oh look yet ANOTHER Grizzlies fan that hates Trae Young!
15 points on 3/17 shooting with 6 turnovers welcome to Jrue jail Trae Young
Why trae young look like a grandpa
Did Marv just confuse Brook Lopez and Trae Young??
"Not being sarcastic, I actually like Trae Young, but is it normally done over 7 foot centres? Can't help but feel like he's running into a Lopez shaped buzzsaw with how he works in the defense."
Literally the only shot Trae Young has selected is a floater over Brook Lopez. I don't understand why it's all he wants to do 😭
Look at Trae Young Stats in Wins vs Losses  E M P T Y   S T A T S  /s
Brook Lopez is the best player in the league  at making Trae Young floaters not go in
"The Harden and Trae Young stats is nuts. Also, the Jokic stat is not at all surprising"
To be fair I would already consider us allies as Mavericks fans and the Slovenians have been very reasonable at least in my opinion.   Our victim complex comes more from guys like Bill Simmons that just refuses to accept he was wrong about Trae.   In general I think most reasonable Hawks fans would agree Luka is better but Trae Young is a damn good player in his own right and solidly top 20 in the league so we’ll just take it on the chin and move regardless
"Both are great young guards. Trae has had better talent to play with, and in the easier conference."
&gt;Trae Young
I'm also a hawks fan. Trae young ranked higher?? WE WON THE TRADE MAN
Marcus Smart is shutting down Trae young for an entire series lmao. First team all defense for a reason.  Good luck having Cam and Hunter on Tatum. Dropping 30+ nightly. Tatum averaged 27/11/6 on Butler last year in the playoffs. Gonna be a murder lmaoooooooo
I've already made an argument. There's nothing left to say beyond Trae Young is a whiney little shit.
No I wouldn't because it doesn't change the fact that Trae Young is a little bitch.
"He didn't apologize. That was pure sarcasm. I couldn't tell you what was going through his head but I'd bet money it wasn't ""I'm going to trip you"" or ""I'm going to injure you."" He was trying to trap the ball handler.   And Trae Young deserved that response. He's carrying on like a fucking child."
He has been clean in the NBA.  All of his “incidents” with Trae Young were instigated by Young.  He’s been fine with everyone else.
Trae Young is completely responsible for every single incident between him and Grayson.   Dude tries a ripthrough and then shoved Allen when they got tangled up.   Or Allen beats him off the dribble and then Trae shoved him in the back.
He's averaging 11 assists per game this season. I used to think he was a Trae Young type player but this year having watched him his assists are his highest value to the nets. Making even deandre jordan look like a shadow of his former self at least.
Joke aside a pointguard who doesn't shoot would be a terrible fit with Gobert but he would make a great pair with guys like Chris Paul or Trae Young offensively.
Trae Young
"I think nine of the roster spots are spoken for if they want it:  PG Steph, Dame  SG Harden, Paul George  SF Kawhi, Durant  PF Lebron, AD  C Bam  who would you have filling the other three spots on the roster? I was thinking something like this:  PG Chris Paul - good to have another floor general on the roster but might have bad blood with Harden  C Jarrett Allen/Myles Turner - backup big that prbly won't see much floor time with Bam and AD on the roster, but can be used against a big center like Jokic or Nurkic. Either of them would be a better fit than Drummond   SG Khris Middleton - thinking of a 3&amp;D guy to fill the last spot but not sure who to pick. It doesn't matter too much since whoever I pick here won't see much floor time unless someone gets hurt. I was also thinking of Tatum but he is still very young and can be picked for the 2024 team along with Zion, Beal, Trae, Fox, Mitchell, etc.  Didn't pick Butler because his offensive skills are redundant with all the ball handlers on the team already and his bad 3 pt shooting"
Yes. Trae young.
"I personally don't think his tangles with Trae were dirty. Certainly he wasn't instigating them, Trae young deserved just as much blame for them as Allen, in my opinion."
"I don't think we will ever see another ridiculous shooter like Steph ever...  It's hilarious looking back just last year when people were quick to call Dame the better shooter than Steph bc Dame extended his range.. but clearly Dame was never on the same level, and of all young guys not Trae Young, not Zach Lavine can come close to this level"
"I love my mavs and have been a fan since rolando, kids, jackson, even Shawn bradley, and of course dirk.  But luka is a gift. I thought once dirk went off into retirement wed lose our way and have to find someone to build around and it'd take awhile.  Then bam... The Hawks basically gave us luka. The drafted trae young but without a doubt I'd take luka.   He's tons of fun to watch, has ""it"" and looks like he's having a great time while playing.   So naturally I love it when I see clips of him doing what he does.   Even better when I open up reddit, and it's the top post on the front page. And I hadn't even logged in yet."
"I mean I didn’t say he owed anyone, especially not someone he didn’t trip, an apology. I just don’t think he seems apologetic. He doesn’t care if he injures people, don’t care if it’s trae young or not.   Also I feel like having “multiple tangles” and a bizarre outburst while only being in the league 2 1/2 years fits my narrative of him being consistently dirty no?   Also I’m not trying to shit on grizzlies players. I like the grizzlies. Allen only came up cuz he missed the 2 free throws to win this game."
"He doesn't owe anyone an apology except for the people he tripped. So that is what it is. Other than that in the NBA he has had tangles with Trae Young (someone who notoriously hunts fouls and has beef with Allen) and he had that bizzare outburst in summer league. Everything else is a reputation issue from college.   If you're gonna talk shit about someone on the Grizzlies being dirty, maybe turn your attention to Jonas? He's had multiple 'dirty' plays this season: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniy2t9K9vI  This video for the 2019/20 season has three grizzlies plays and Grayson isn't on any of them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3-FRL4TiXc"
"Everytime I see Luka do something amazing, I hate Trae Young more."
You forgot Trae Young is better.
"Hey where was Trae Young during the all star game, I must’ve missed him 🤔 Tatum would dumpster your team in 5 games lmao, congrats on not being dogshit for once!"
Trae Young gotta be up there
Didn’t realize how bad Vucevic was on defense until I watched Trae Young score 40 points against the Bulls off wide open floaters while Vuc just stood in the paint and did nothing to stop him
Trae young knows all about imitating harden so it makes sense.
"There are so many examples of young players being cornerstones of their teams. Imagine taking Trae, Luka, Zion, and Tatum off their respective teams"
I'm not a cavs fan but I believe this   In a couple of years sexton and trae young will be comparable players once Cleveland gets their shit together
Trae young has peaked
Either Trae Young or IT
Trae Young
Trae young
"Trae Young is honestly the opposite, the doubles he draws makes his offensive impact even more than his stats indicate"
"Okay but you say all this, but for all those things, the pacers offense has always been bad with him on the floor even though these Pacers team have had some pretty good offensive talent, and the stats still can't show how bad of a defender he is, can't guard on the perimeter, doesn't provide weak side rim protection, and isn't very mobile.  The stats do not at all represent Sabonis, if they did Trae Young would've been an all star ahead of him."
"That’s an interesting one. Because Trae Young for example is a 25/10 player on solid efficiency. His offensive impact is massive, like those numbers indicate. However, in general he probably wouldn’t be as valuable as a player because of his defense. But nothing about his stats would originally indicate that.  So, I will look at players who have great defensive stats but aren’t as valuable as those stats would indicate:  Myles Turner is a great blocker but he is not a DPOY caliber type defender even though he gets a ton of blocks.  Donte DiVincenzo gets a good amount of steals but he isn’t really a great defender.  It’s a lot harder to be considered much worse than stats indicate on the offensive end. If you are just looking at points? Then sure, but even a basic stat like FG%, 3P% and the attempts for each all will indicate ""chuckers"""
"People don't like Trae Young despite his 25/10/4 statline, above average TS and the fact that the team craters with him off the floor.    I don't agree that he's worse than the stats indicate but that's a pretty popular opinion."
A shooting and playmaking point guard with a two-way big. All time: prime Steph and Prime Shaq. Current: Steph and Embiid. Future: Trae Young and Jokic/Embiid.
"Are you expecting a luka doncic or a trae young every single draft? That’s not how the nba draft works dude, drafts don’t typically have super stars on day 1"
Get the trae young
Problem is off ball fouls don’t get called as much. If he played more like doncic or trae young but that’s not his game he loves doing tons of off ball movement
"Players have burned Gobert in the past because they know that he can be exploited, afaik KD himself in the past implied that how can you be a DPOY and be played off the court like Harden did with Gobert.  And now Utah fans will come at me with a bunch of stats saying that it wasn't the case when i repeatedly watched Harden HUNT Gobert on offense as if he was playing against Trae Young. Rudy's impact is laughably low in the postseason for years now and it's one of the reasons nobody takes Utah seriously this year."
"&gt;Playstyle wise, Damian Lillard and Trae Young are the most similar players to Stephen Curry  They're similar player in that they're small, (kind of) skinny and happy to pull up from anywhere, but their playstyle as in how often they run what sort of actions on court is very different. Curry famously engages in a lot of off-ball movement where fewer fouls are generally called and even then are less likely to not lead to FTs (pre-bonus), and less PnR/iso where it's the ball-handler that's getting fouled. But when he runs PnR/iso plays, he gets fouled at similar rates to the other guys mentioned.  *This isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*  (Data from this season, just as a sanity check, not as a be all end all. Using the 4 players mentioned above and a few other notable high usage ball-handlers/non-bigs.)

He does stand out in terms of how often he runs an action he's likely to get a shooting foul on.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry does however lead in how many handoff plays he runs -- [let's look at the top-10 guys in terms of handoff possessions](https://go.nba.com/mc0m) and Booker since he's close and appears in tables above:  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Murray|3.2|7.2| |Curry|2.9|9.8| |Duncan Robinson|2.8|3.3| |Beal|2.8|9.9| |McDermott|2.4|5.9| |Jaylen Brown|2.3|8.8| |Jerami Grant|2.1|10.9| |Hayward|2.0|9.3| |LaVine|1.9|7.1| |Dame|1.9|8.1| |Booker|1.6|6.7|  Two things to note -- Curry is not low on the list of Shooting Foul frequency. Also, the overall shooting-foul-frequency is lower than on PnR/Iso plays -- defenders know not to foul the 3pt shooter.  This is just a quick, sanity-check look at why Curry probably has a lower baseline of foul calls and FTA than some other players -- running plays with a lower likelihood of a shooting foul more often, not simply getting calls less often on the same kind of plays.  *Again, this isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*"
Trae Young is in no way shape or form one of the most similar players to Steph Curry. Bombing long threes is not the same thing as playing like Steph.
you want trae young to play only 1 quarter?
Honestly Trae Young having triple the games with &gt;15 FTA while playing 9 fewer years is amazing.
Trae young fucking idiots
"Still the reigning Champs. Feelsgoodman.  Enjoy never winning anything with Trae ""despite the loss"" Young!"
That trae young capela pick and roll was not must watch that shit is going to give me nightmares
"Even if he were a Trae Young-tier defender, his offensive value would more than make up for it.   They could legit surround him with elite defenders who have trash offensive games, since his heaves are all they need."
"&gt;He needs to take 300 shots to get to 100+ points.   Huh wydm? Let him go 45/120 from full court and that's an easy 135 points, then they just gotta hold the other team to less than 135.   &gt;Surely not all inbound passes make it, and he'd get fouled several times scoring 1 out of 3 attempts, so the hypothetical 300 shots would need to go higher, 350-380 times a game to even reach average PPG.  They could foul him but like I said, he could bait them for the 4 point play so it wouldn't be worthwhile. If they put 2 or 3 men on him to deny the pass, the rest of the team has an easy fastbreak opportunity.  &gt;And if he's dogshit on defense, its a 4v5 everytime  OP made no mentions of defense so we'd assume he's an average player. Even if he were Trae Young bad, it's not enough to make up for his insane offense."
"He literally has to catch the inbounds pass and shoot it, not to mention he doesn't have to play 48 mins lol. But the rest of the team has to exert literally 0 energy on offense. Even if he were Trae Young levels of bad defensively, he'd still be a cheat code.   Fouling him would be the only way, but if he's smart he could get tons of and-1s or bait a lot of ""before-the-inbounds"" fouls as well."
Prayers up for Trae young 🙏🏻
Said he got it for his “defense” on Trae young
Not if the Hawks get healthy in any way shape or form. Yall had to take an already crippled Trae Young less hawks to overtime.
Are we super confident about that after watching Elfrid guard Trae Young tonight though?
Bittersweet win when a star on the other team gets injured. Any update on Trae Young?

Saying this when Trae young is on your team do you have no self awareness?

"Trae is a fine young player, I was making a joke based on KD's recent tweet. I think comparing two players and seeing who's the best is a bit crazy. MJ was the best player, but he never wins shit without Pippen. It's still down to a team and coaching and the best players being in the best place to win.  Right now PG is in the right situation. When Trae ends up in the right situation he will receive similar accolades."

"When you speak in absolutes, focus on things that don’t matter like Trae young in previous seasons and make discourse overly reductive, then yes I can see how you might come to flawed conclusions like “there is no case for Zion over Randle”"
i think the trae young sentiment is really volatile but itll ultimately depend on his performance. i dont think anyone is going to shit on him if he gets matched up vs a good team and plays well in his first playoffs

"&gt;in fact i’ve said repeatedly he doesn’t need to and that i think he can become merely above average as an NBA athlete lol  right, which means he's never going to have that dimension that Ja has.  &gt;a fucking nba strength training program isn’t going to have him on an upper body training program lmao  why wouldnt it, lol?  that's actually an important part of being able to absorb and fight through contact at the rim.    &gt;putting on 15 pounds never works out so cleanly?????????? HES 20 YEARS OLD. he’s gonna so easily put on 20 pounds  you don't know that.  you don't know if his frame can handle that.  a lot fo dudes dont just add muscle like that.    and when i say cleanly, im not disputing that he can put on the muscle, im disputing whether or not it will come with the changes you're hoping for.  im not doubting he can put on 15 pounds, im doubting that it really elevates his game as much as you think it will.  &gt;Garland has literally gotten Embiid 3 times in one game in the last 4 minutes just with his hesi.  ok?  thats great.  thats one thing he can do, and its not the same as what Ja is doing, nor does it produce the same results.  &gt;does steph need to get more explosive? Kyrie? CP3? Trae Young?  no, but the argument was whether or not he can stress the defense the way Ja can.  he can't.  he can do different things, but he'll never do what Ja does, and neither will any of those players.  that doesnt mean im saying Ja is better than CP3 or Steph, nor that i'd rather have Ja.  all it is saying is that Ja does things that they can't do, and it affect's defense's differently.  you argued THAT point, and have since moved the goal posts from ""Garland can do that"" to ""it doesnt matter, he can do other things"" which was never what i was saying."

This but unironically when it’s Trae Young /s
He isn't a trae young defender but he certainly isn't good for a center. Just look at his lebron or raptor rating on defense not to mention just watching him play like steals dont really mean much for defensive impact or was Allen Iverson an elite defender because he lead the league in steals. Lol funny how jokic has 8.8 assists and you round that up which is fine but for curry his 5.9 doesnt go up to 6. You cant sum up the game and impact in counting stats. Jokic and Curry are both MVP candidates but to act like curry isn't even close is disingenuous especially after the stretch he has been having.
"As someone who has watched a lot of Cavs basketball and not that many Grizzlies games, this seems insane.   Has Ja been underwhelming this year? Garland shows flashes of Trae Young level play but is pretty damn inconsistent."
"They should be fine against any non-Brooklyn team. Playing drop against Tatum or Trae Young isn't the best idea, but Simmons can get around any pick to bother the pull-up."
"looks pretty good! I'd put luka over AD and I think Lavine should be ahead of trae young. also simmons is probably too low, but yeah there is so much talent right now it's insane"
"Well it worked, Harden has been flopping less after being called out for being a floppee and it ruining his reputation.  Lebroning was a word used to describe flopping too back when Lebron flopped every play but he stopped once even kids started clowning him.  More recently Trae Young has stopped flopping as much because of the negativity it created.   Whether you like it or not, no one likes flopping, and the best way to stop it is to call out the players for cheating the system and making it harder for the refs when the game is already fast."
you must think trae young is the best scorer in the league then lmaooo
Also because a lot of people forgot he existed. Media always mentioned Luka and Trae Young so he kinda went under the radar
"I like Trae Young and Luka Doncic better, personally but Ja is up there"
Remember at the beginning of this season when some people were saying Trae Young would surpass Curry as the better player? Lol
Man Ja is really fun to watch. He and Trae Young are 2 of my favorite young players to watch.
Trae young doesn't hate kids and charity
Embiid and Trae Young. . . .those two just. .
"I agree for sure. All young teams need to get their butts kicked in the playoffs, so let Nate get us there while teaching them all how to win in the regular season. If we get stuck as a first round exit for a few years it wouldnt be the worst since 3 of our starters are still on their rookie deals and we have a long window with Trae."
and still a bit behind trae young
Trae Young and Lillard are better though amirite..? /s
missed that one FT which could’ve gotten him 50. Fucking scrub I’d rather have Trae Young
thats not accurate at all. hes legit the only star player on their team with it was being against the clippers and clutched up to make it a 4-2 series. baby trae young hasnt even gone anywhere lol
Embiid flops 10x more than Trae Young don’t even @ me. People hate Trae because he’s light skin with a bad haircut
"always liked the hawks and believe it or not i love trae young. im glad old nate is workin out for you guys, ill put hawks on the list to consider🙏🏼"
Neither Curry nor Dame has hair like Trae Young.
"Lillard is athletic as fuck, way more like a modern day KJ than like Trae Young or Curry"
"He's up there with the all-time greats: Nash, Magic, Stockton, CP3, Westbrook all great pick and roll passers. Even now players like Jokic, Doncic and Trae Young are some of the best passers the league has seen and all are under the age of 27. I'd probably say Nash is my personal choice for best at getting his big men buckets. Him and Stoudemire was a lethal combination."
"yeah, it's full of dense people like you that can't accept a fact and keep making comment after comment about the same shit that was answered multiple times. stats, eye test, accomplishments and general consensus between players, coaches and the media says that Doncic is obviously better than Trae Young. yes, he is obviously better. no discussion at all"
Some people talk about Steph Curry like he's just a hair better than guys like Trae Young and Dame Lillard. They talk like he was some sort of trailblazer who was only different because other people were afraid to spot up from the logo back then.  These people are goofy.
Ya fix it like trae young
my response was to a much different post. I see you were actually conversing lol I’m definitely sorry about the tone there.  I think I honestly just want to be able to enjoy watching my team or like actually learn about the way they play without it devolving into a shitshow so it can make us hawks people ornery as hell.  Like even this post that’s supposed to be a celebration of the Trae young ends with a giant fuck you middle finger about Luka. And then when I try to argue we should tone down that shit you get downvoted to oblivion.  I mean I guess the Nba fandom is just a shitshow in general.  My B
"First off - Trae hasn't achieved that yet. The Hawks are tied for 4th/5th and half a game ahead of #6 with 20% of the season left. That's not to say he won't pull it off, but god damn he's been the best player on an above .500 team for literally one month of his NBA career (March 18th - present). It's not unreasonable for people to want more proof that he can be the best player on a team that wins in the playoffs. The same is true for KAT, was true for AD, etc.  Secondly, people have different career paths. Wade won a chip his third season, but that didn't make him a better player than Lebron. Tatum went on a conference finals run as a #3 seed in his third year, but the Celtics have regressed some this season. Unless you're a top-10 player ever, your roster matters a lot.  The Hawks went out and acquired a super deep team because they realized Trae having a bunch of 30ppg / 30 win seasons wasn't going to help his development. They needed to support him if they wanted him to take the leap and he has done a nice job holding up his end of the bargain. At 22, that's all we can ask, but 31-26 also isn't a legend's final destination. It's not at all weird that our expectations of a player this young with this much talent would evolves as he continues to walk the walk."
"Now I really want Trae Young to join the Raptors, so we can refer to that duo as TraeBoucher."
"I think almost all young guys besides Luka and Trae have to improve as a playmaker and reading defenses. Donovan Mitchells started doing it and he's in the top 10 for MVP. And hard agree on all the Fournier takes. Hes got a little French in his game and reads the floor well, like Diaw and Batum. Was a stud in the Olympics a while back.   My main critique of the Celtics FO is the Walker acquisition. He is not a player who fits in that system. He was all iso and pnr in Charlotte, who had some ungodly low number of his field goals being assisted. Kinda weird but a Terry Rozier or a Tomas Satoransky is who they need in that slot. a combo guard who can be a secondary creator but is also a deadly floor spacer and defender. Not a pure scoring point like Kemba. Having Smart at the 2 compounds this even more imo because he's not a bad initiator but can't space for Kemba and he's a ball stopper sometimes (though he makes the right passes a decent bit too)."
Bouncier? Trae Young has bounce?
&gt;LOL.  Trae was the better playmaker and scorer last year while being surrounded by one of the worst rosters in the league.  That's not really how it works. He's surrounded by a much better roster this year and has regressed in nearly every facet of the game bar freethrow shooting.  Like what la la land are you people living in? Trae Young has like 12 games where he's shot 50 percent from the field or better this season.
The Eastern conference in its entirety is a joke. Trae Young is facing tanking teams &amp; college kids. Luka is going against the best of the best in the West.
i’m a trae young disciple but i thought 6-8 was gonna be a dog fight for the hawks too. nobody knew the heat and craptors would be meh and that the wizards would be a dumpster fire.   conversely nobody saw the knicks being good or charlotte competing
"spending 4/72 for bog and 3/61 for danilo sure as hell made it seem like the hawks wanted to get into the playoffs  nothing about trae's narrative has changed for Luka stans, including myself. Trae is an amazing offensive talent but his defense is bad. His DBPM has been negative every year but trending less bad (-2.8, -2.3, -1.9). Compare to Chris Paul who has been +2 or higher his entire career.  The day Trae was drafted I figured his destiny, as is has always been with the Atlanta Hawks, is to have a ceiling as a 3 seed or a 4 seed and get sent home in the 2nd round.  The only way for me to feel less pessimistic about this is seeing him in the playoffs managing to hold up with the Isaiah Thomas treatment of getting brutalized in the pick and roll 60 times a game.  The other way I'd feel less pessimistic is if they pay Collins and he makes an MVP leap, or another one of these young guys suddenly makes an All star leap. Or if an MVP-level player decided they wanted to team up with Trae.  The arguments at every level are still pro-Luka. Luka is better OBPM, has a positive DBPM, has shown up in the playoffs already."
You mean Trae Young?!??!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?   &amp;#x200B;  /s if it wasn't obvious
"The front office made a good roster to play AROUND TRAE YOUNG.  Is this really a difficult point to grasp. It works because the front office had a vision of a team that they would build around their star player that they traded Luka for. They then get those players and the team wins games but clearly it’s not because of the player they built the whole damn team around????   They’re doing what they’re supposed to, that’s great, but like he’s still the center of the team. Christ   Lord alive"
I think we get caught up comparing players but I'm not sure it matters all that much.  I live in Florida and I was REALLY hoping Trae would fall to Orlando.  I would be estactic with either player lol.  My whole adult life has had lebron dominating so I think in some ways it's normalized how great one person can make a team.  Everyone else needs the right system and surrounding players to win.  Luka and Trae (and other young stars) always make me think you can win it all with them but you got to get the right surrounding players and system to complement their strengths and minimize their weaknesses.    Your right about off ball skill btw.  I love watching great ball movement and fluid motion and I think a lot of nba guys should add it to their arsenal.
"Not that unexpected to some of us watching the kid and not listening to the idiotic circlejerk.    I also question your last comparison.  Much better based on what?  Trae Young is basically a younger bouncier version of curry, right down to the criticisms about their defense."
"I think Luka is a more consistent scorer and can get to his spots easier than Trae can. You will see the games Trae is not hitting his floater and his efficiency takes a big dip. Hawks fans will admit Trae has been up and down with his scoring this year. But, Trae catches way too much heat nationally he is a top 5 young player in the NBA."
homer answer: Joe Harris  actual answer: Jimmy Butler or Trae Young
"Man if there’s anything this season has taught me it’s  the NBA is just run by narratives from assholes like Windhorst and Bill Simmons and these people spout bullshit so often that it becomes reality.   The Heat have been title contenders this entire season for no discernible reason.   Jaylen Brown and Tatum are both all stars and Young isn’t despite being more successful.  Zach Lavine has been an “empty stats guy” his entire career and now suddenly he’s an all NBA level talent that the bulls should build around even though their record is still hot garbage.  The knicks being mediocre will save the NBA despite just being another giant market for young stars to go after their rookie contract expires.   Lamelo Ball is better than SGA, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Jason Tatum, and Dearon Fox.  I could go on and on"
"Imagine if they had Trae Young, they maybe could be the 4th seed /s"
Basketball? Trae Young has never played it
Trae Young is good at basketball
Trae Young shoots 8.8 free throws a game. Luka shoots 7.3 lol
Mavs had a better roster last year yet all we heard was how bad Trae Young is and how good Luka is

Unfortunately when you're traded for a guy like Trae Young you're going to look bad no matter how good you are
"I'm a Trae Young skeptic (I think he needs a lot of help on defense and is a streaky scorer), but I have to admit it is impressive."
"Grizzlies and Hawks both have widely hated players in Grayson Allen and Trae Young respectively, however Grayson Allen is hated because he is a genuinely dirty piece of shit and Trae cuz gets a lot of fouls called on him and he gets to the line.   Pels have a hyper popular and exciting young core in Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and some fat guy from Duke. Honestly both an exciting future and also a future that I'm pretty sure they'll fuck up somehow so follow the Hawks, unless you want to be happy in any way."
Trae Young in shambles
"Ah, so you never saw the great offensive scheme of Oladipo or Brogdon ISOing on the perimeter before bricking a shot, leaving everyone standing around the preimeter? Shame, it was a truly amazing offense.  Either it's McMillan having Trae fucking Young and Clint Capela as he did with Oladipo (pre-injury) and Sabonis, or he's really taken the time to learn offensive schemes. I'm really glad for him that the Hawks are the perfect team for him to raise the ground. It seems like his biggest weaknesses with us are positives for the Hawks."
Trae Young is Elite.
"It’s almost like a young player grows over the course of seasons....also the old hawks coach was holding them back severely and they’ve had multiple core player injuries all year....but now Trae is stepping up big time, trying hard on defense, getting his teammates involved and coming up clutch when needed. He had 12 or 13 points and 4/5 assists in the fourth today"
"The year is 20XX. De’Aaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report. The Fox availability metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, the Sacramento Kings, and their army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning championships with the other. The basketball metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so other teams pray Fox is out for the night, and that’s the game.  The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De’Foxcalypse . But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox’s raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association’s version of basketball. Try as you will, but 20XX is coming. Or maybe, it’s already here."
Aka trae young.
Did Trae Young quit the league while I wasn’t paying attention?
"Start: De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle, Bam Adebayo  Cut: The rest of em  Shooting guard is definitely the most difficult to decide. Close race between all of them."
"He’s the only reason the hawks aren’t the 30th worst defense in a starting lineup with trae young, bogdon bogdonavich, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon hill. Not to mention atrocious defenders like Lou Williams and gallinari and a mediocre guy like John Collins. Capela is a monster at protecting the rim while bam isn’t, which is by far the most important part of center defense."
"You’ve made good points but it goes both ways, even if you lockdown trae, we still have Bogdan, who is averaging 22 on 50/50/90 shooting since becoming a starter, we still have Capela who would absolutely feast. There are definitely match ups that go in our favor too. On top of that our bench is definitely better, you guys have Fournier, we have guys like Gallo, Lou, Huerter, snell, reddish which is probably a top 5 bench in the league while you guys struggle in that area. You make it seem like this series would be a breeze just because of experience but we’re not just a young team anymore either we have some great veterans as well."
"No argument? I just gave you my reasons.   I will gladly welcome a #24 ranked defense in the first round. Brad Stevens will be looking at McMillan like BBQ chicken before the series even starts.   For reference, the Celtics are top 15 in defense since their recent play. They were around #22 before I believe, still better than Atlanta. Those guys are not going to lock the Jays down in the playoffs.   That’s your delusion. Do I think Marcus Smart is going to slow Trae Young down? No I don’t, because Trae is that good. It’s irrelevant though."
"As a Celtics fan, I’m worried about Thibs, the way he’s able to adjust in a playoff experience, his experience and his ability to coach an elite defense. I would not want to play the Knicks in round 1 for these reasons.   Would I be scared of Julius Randle? No. He’s the easiest guy to deal with of all the teams we could play. I’d rather deal with Randle than Trae Young, or Jimmy/Bam.   I would rather wake up to the news that Thibs has food poisoning and can’t coach the Knicks, than say Randle missing a game due to injury.   Not sure if you know this, but since the trade deadline, the Celtics have moved from 22nd or so to 15th in defensive rating. We’ve had a top 5 defense over the past few weeks. Not as much feasting will go on as you believe sir."
"I will stay we were in a worse shape, both teams were shorthanded as you say, but we f'in started Javonte Green who's not even an NBA player. I still really like Marcus Smart on Trae Young much more than Hunter on whoever he's guarding"

"Are we just not gonna talk about Steph's fewer assists and greater turnovers? Or the fact that Harden can make TLC, Claxton, and Bruce Brown look like gods? Lmao. Im sorry but if steph drives to the rim that corner and slot isn't opening up the same. Not saying Steph isn't a great playmaker, but this is ridiculous. Trae young and dame are both better playmakers than steph too"
Nostalgia is eternal. Ten years from now we’ll probably talk about how classy Trae Young is and how Bronny is ruining basketball
"their young talent is ok but they are really missing someone to be the main star of their franchise. Derozan is good but you're not going anywhere if hes the best player on your team.   Trading Demar gives you the ability to get a higher enough draft pick to get a Zion, Edwards, Morant, Lamelo, Luka, Trae, etc. Thats something they are never going to get if they don't rebuild properly and just fight for the 8th seed every year."
"I definitely read the title as ""Trae Young"".."
Trae young is short James harden and luka is tall James harden so I don't feel like people would forget how they play but I doubt we get another lebron kd or Steph in a while
"I think Zach Lowe has touched on this multiple times on podcasts, including recently with David Thorpe and Howard Beck, but I do think it's interesting to define what really is the *most improved.*   G-league/bench player to NBA starter? Ex: someone like Donovan Graham last year  Negative player to All-Star? Ex: maybe Trae Young rookie to sophomore year, or Julius Randle/Zach LaVine this year  All-Star to best player on a championship team? Jokic this year"
"Trae Young, Clint Capela, John Collin?"
"I literally almost specifically excluded Zach Lavine because I think he’s clearly on the outside of the great young guards lmao.  Guys like Lamelo, Luka, Morant, Murray and Trae Young are reading and playing the game at an insanely high level that we’ve never really seen before. At least, not this much talent clustered in one generation of players. They’re still young and don’t necessarily know how to win yet, so they shouldn’t be on any all-time list yet of course. But in their primes they’ll just be way more advanced than anyone who’s prime occurred pre-2012 or so.  I’m not arguing we should reconfigure out GOAT lists or whatever, because how good guys were *in their era* is important. And I would assume that if AI was a rookie in 2018 and played out his career over the next 10+ years he’d end up a way more skilled player than he was in the early 2000s.  I’m just generally of the belief that if aliens challenged humans to a “Fate Of The World” basketball game and offered us a time machine to select any player from any year we wanted, something like 95% of the team should be current guys. Given his passing, shooting and athleticism, peak Paul George is probably a good deal better than like peak Scottie pippen or Clyde or whatever. That doesn’t mean we should rank him higher all time, just that if the world depended on it I’d pick him over almost anyone from the 90s. And I think PG is at best like the 9th best player of the past 5ish years."
I think hawks' priority is to give their young guys playoff experience over actually competing for the title. If they make it to 2nd round and force the series to 6-7 games thats pretty good for them. Their core is still very young and as long as theh can keep it together they can be a serious threat to win the title in a couple years. Trae-JC-Capela is a scary trio and they have guys with high potential like Hunter- Reddish.
"James harden and trae young have improved recently but still aren’t as good as people say they are. Trae is still a liability and harden is not an elite defender like some nets fans and skip bayless say he is. Also jrue holiday is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league when he’s giving max effort but lately he hasn’t been trying as hard, like when KPJ dropped 50 on him. Also  gallinari is one of the worst defenders in the league and nobody talks about it."
It’s pretty obviously Trae Young

"So this got pretty long so sorry about that. I’ll put the main numbers first  in case you don’t want to read all the rambling analysis.  Also I’m specifically focusing on numbers from April. Randle’s been performing better this year as a whole and I think he should be at least second team all nba, especially if the Knicks stay in the fourth/fifth seed.  Randle: 27.1/9/6.3 on 57.2% ts (exactly league average) with a 115.6 offensive rating compared to the Knicks’ offensive rating of 116.8 overall  Tatum: 29.7/9.1/4.5 on 62% ts with a 118.3 offensive rating compared to the Celtics’ offensive rating which of 113.4 overall  Tatum’s volume combined with efficiency is pretty crazy. Last month, Tatum was fourth in the league in points per game behind Steph, Beal and Mitchell. Only Steph scored more points total. scoring at least 25ppg, Tatum had a higher ts% than every player averaging 25 or more besides Steph and Giannis. The next highest scorers with a better ts are Durant, Jokic, and Kawhi who all scored over five points per game less than him.  Randle scored a lot as well but not as much as Tatum and he did so on 5% lower true shooting which is pretty big.  The difference in assists is smaller than the difference in points. While I’d give Randle the edge regardless, there is something to be said about Tatum’s numbers being affected by the other playmakers/passers on their respective teams and how it’s affected their playmaking style. Happy to provide some of the tracking data about passes but it mostly just shows a difference in role with Randle being the primary facilitator (and he deserves kudos for taking that on and flourishing) while Tatum plays with two other primary facilitators in the starting lineup and the ball actually got moved around quite a bit more... at least in April lol, we’re still working on that.  Some of offensive rating is just noise but Tatum and Randle both play so many minutes that I feel more comfortable using it though I understand like any stat, there’s more context to it.  The highest offensive rating by a team was 117.7 and belonged to the Suns. Knicks actually had the third highest offensive rating at 116.8 but Randle’s offensive rating was only 115.6 and while that isn’t much of a difference, Tatum‘s offensive rating of 118.3 was higher than any individual team’s offensive rating despite the Celtics having the 12th highest offensive rating last month at 113.4.   Out of all players who participate in at least ten games for at least 30 minutes per game average, Tatum is eighth out of eighty four players in offensive rating and every player above him is on either the nuggets or suns besides Trae Young. If you lower the restrictions to include all players with at least 10 games and 20 minutes,  there are still only 24 players out of 207 that have an offensive rating equal to or above every team in the league and all but three of them - Embiid, Khem Birch, and OG - play on a team with a higher offensive rating overall than the Celtics.  With that said, I’m a biased Celtics fan and statistics can be interpreted in a number of ways. They’re both great players, I just was particularly impressed with Tatum’s offense last month especially."
LaMelo was the clear cut rookie the first half of the year. This is like Luka vs Trae Young all over again.
"You seem to be confusing man for kid. I was talking about your child player, Trae Young."
He saw trae young and realized he couldn’t beat him
Trae Young
You can tell these suns announcers HAAAAAATE Trae young so much
"Trae Young was doing whatever he wanted before he got injured last game against the Knicks. If they play better defense on him and hit their 3s, I can see the Knicks pulling out. Hawks have so many shooters though. Plus Capela was doing work inside.  Gun to my head, probably Hawks"
"The Hawks have more talent, but the Knicks have more grit.  All I can say is I hope we avoid the Hawks because after 8 years of a playoff drought the last thing I wanna see is Trae Young foul baiting his way to the semis."
"Without picking any of the locks, i think a realistic team of:  PG: Trae Young (CP3 would be ideal here, but i don't think he plays)  SG: Jimmy Butler/Devin Booker  SF: jason Tatum  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo  &amp;#x200B;  Should be able to win it all."
"Jokic’s game is amazing to watch.   He is heavily involved in the offence while also not dominating the ball. Also doesn’t bait for fouls nearly to the extent of other young stars (like Luka and Trae), while also being a transcendent passer.   Not being an American could hurt him in this regards, but frankly the face of the league he pretty consistently been the best player."
Its crazy! You always hear the measurements of these guys but seeing them in person is crazy.  Or when you see a guy taller on paper then he is in real life such as kemba walker and trae young.
Trae Young and Luka Dončić
"he was listed at 6’9 entering the draft and he’s never even looked that tall tbh, maybe he went from 6’7–&gt;6’8 in that offseason but these things usually get way overblown, like when the hawks said trae young put on 20 pounds of muscle over the offseason and etc. Tatum actually seemed to grow last season and he’s listed at 6’10 now and compare him to george who looks a lot smaller"
"Lol the locks are all NBA boomers who are not playing the Olympics after this trainwreck of a season except the ones who get bounced early.  A young Olympic squad would be fun to watch though. Bam, Booker, Brown, Tatum, BI, Zion, Randle, Trae."
"The hawks defensive rating is over 6 points better with him on vs off the court, leader in rebounds, top 5 in blocks yet outside the top 60 in fouls. His defense makes him the 2nd most valuable player on the hawks. His rim protection minimizes trae young and John Collin’s piss poor defense."
Lol you asked someone to find a more egregious flopper than AD and they said Trae Young....[you were literally the one who brought up flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n4iy5b/singer_nikola_jokic_i_think_we_all_forget_who/gwwuru1/)
I don't like trae young
"TBF, ""iso all the time"" might work better with Trae Young than it worked for any of our players"
Very true.  He unfortunately was the other center in the Shaq draft.  Sort of like how Trae Young will always be not Luka.  Mourning will always be not Shaq.  Plus those injuries and health scares robbed us of 4 years of quality All Star level play.
WTF you are trying to compare Lamelo with players like dlo and Kyrie. Don’t get me wrong Kyrie and trae are very good and special players  but We are talking about big playmaking point guards that have the body of a wing. You have to compare him to Simmons and Luka if we are talking about this type of Player. Simmons with a jumper would already be atop 5 player. He is still very young he could eventually become one and Luka is already a top 5 player. Therefore you’re argument is very bad !

Maverick HOF Trae Young lmfao
"I mean, if you just signed in, you signed in as Blake Griffin flopped for the millionth time in his career, and Bucks fans reacted exactly the same as any fanbase does when faced with that shit.  And when it comes to players flopping against the Bucks over the past 3+ years, I don't think anyone even comes close to the number of times Blake has done it.  In our matchups with the Pistons (when he was actually playing) it was just embarrassing.  A monster of a man flopping harder than the worst of Trae Young/Harden/any other player you can think of who has a reputation for it."
I love how Trae Young does the slav squat when he is frustrated
"I actually just checked and since April the Knicks have the #2 best 3pt defense and the Hawks have the 3rd best.  With that said, I’m going to disagree with my fellow Knicks fans and say that the Hawks would win the series. Talent wins in the playoffs and your team is simply more talented.  I just hope y’all fall to the 6th seed because Id hate watching Trae Young foul baiting for 35 minutes a game for an entire series. It’s some monkey paw shit that we’d finally make the playoffs but it’s against Trae Young lol"
"Yeah. Most of the heavy hitters drafted in the past 10 years have all ended up in the West. AD, Luka, Zion, Dame, Towns (even though his team sucks), Booker, Donovan Mitchell, SGA, Gobert, Fox, Ingram, Morant, Jokic.  Meanwhile, the East drafted Giannis, Embiid, Trae Young, Beal, Tatum, Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Bam."
"You said find a more egregious flopper, so if Trae Young is a more egregious flopper, the conversation IS about him. You didn’t say find a more egregiously flopping C/PF. You basically issued a challenge to name a worse flopper and in that case I could point out Harden, Trae Young, Pat Bev, etc etc."
&gt; The conversation isn’t about Trae young  Huh. Funny. You said:  &gt; find a more egregious flopper  I did. He plays on the team you root for.
The conversation isn’t about Trae young and you’re butthurt that I ignored your dumbass comment.
6’1 180 versus 6’10 253....  Your disingenuous response is undeserving of your flair  **I love how no one disputes it.**  And the conversation isn’t about Trae young... but please continue
"You call so easily other players mediocre while fail to see the irony in defending Westbrook? Let me ask you this, what makes Westbrook elite?  1. He is a below average scorer. You have every single % in the world pointing towards that. 2. He is a terrible shooter and defenders don't respect his shot. 3. He is a below average defender.  4. He is probably an elite playmaker BUT if you ignore the high turnover rate and his tendencies to hunt for assists.   So apart from being a likeble guy, the only remaining elite quality that Westbrook has is his passing which makes him extremelly predictable in the high profile matches when teams prepare for you. Not only that, since 2016 every single of his teams underperforms bar probably 2017 and his playoff games are abysmal in every sense of the world.  All the mentioned guys are either younger and faster or extremelly more efficient than him. Watching how Lowry dictates a game and how Westbrook does it, it's night and Day.  Apart from leading in assists, there isn't any metric out there that suggest Westbrook being a top 10 PG in the League. You have young players like Luka, Ja, Trae leading their teams to far better records with comparable teams"

Trae Young will probably make it over Booker. Has only played 3 games less but is a far more impactful player.
"Hence the ""**most** other players"" but you having to throw out trae young and harden as a defense pretty much proves my point lol. Plus harden baits harder but doesn't bitch to the refs as much which is really what bugs me more."
"Oh my god bro, of course they do it more egregiously than Lebron. Have you seen harden play? Trae young? Like, what are you even talking about? Lebron plays through more contact than anybody in the league except Jokic and Embiid."
"I'm a Memphis fan, but Ja really needs to cool down. He is playing badly and is acting out almost all season and is never held accountable by anyone - coach, teammates or fans. Yeah the team is young and inexperienced, but stupid highlight plays aren't going to solve your shortcomings, just work on your shot, read the game and play some defence for god's sake. He is becoming more and more like Luka and Trae in a bad way."
After the performance Mavs great Trae Young put on. I guess the Hawk's Luka Doncic is gonna have to reciprocate.
"Dame is 10x the player Trae Young is, quit the cringey ass disrespect once you win a single game. The dude leads his team to the playoffs in the west every year despite no help and Trae leads his team to the bottom of the east without a stacked roster full of insane shooters, rim protectors and lob threats"
"&gt; is greatest accomplishment is hitting two game winners in first round series  &gt; He constantly falls off when the stage is the greatest  I like some Trae Young praise, but this is just completely backwards. A regular season game, even if its for standings, is not anywhere close to the value Dame has brought at the end of games in the postseason. That being said, Trae can definitely be as good or better than Dame when its all said and done with more experience in the playoffs and defense along with working on off-ball movement."
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
"Hawks fans, thoughts on when Trae Young wore the goggles? I thought they looked hella sick"
Kawhi leonard as cyborg  Paul George as Booster Gold   Russell Westbrook as the the dazzler   Dame lillard as cat woman   Kevin love as night crawler  Chris Paul as Wonder Woman   Karl Anthony towns as  hawk girl    Trae young as moon knight   Luka as squirrel girl  Boogie cousins as also cat woman for some reason
probably trae young
TRAE YOUNG IS MY 2ND FAVORITE PLAYER FROM THE 2018 DRAFT AND I HOPE HE HAS A CAREER GAME TONIGHT
"Unless NBA.com missed something, Luka is 2nd most at 21 drives per game, ahead of Trae Young 20.2, and behind Shai Gilgeou- Alexander 25.2"
"Book, Tatum, Mitchell, Luka, Zion, Trae, Embiid, Simmons, Giannis, AD, Jokic, Murray, SGA, Lamelo, Ant, etc. etc. etc.  Jesus Christ the league has so much great young talent."
"Yep, Trae Young except he's only a good offensive player rather than a overwhelmingly great one like Trae Young. His ball dominance and defense make him an awkward fit in a lot of lineups."
"He isn’t wrong  He’s better than other starters in the league, but his offensive production doesn’t match his defensive liabilities.  He’s like a poor man’s Trae Young"
Luka whines more than Lebron  Trae Young foul baits more than Harden  “Sam Bowie”
A better Trae Young
"&gt; Trae Young wasn't defined by his first half of the season  Literally no one is ""defining"" Anthony Edwards by the first half of his season lol you're still making this argument even though I have not advocated for throwing out his awesome second half even a little bit  kick that strawman's ass bud"
I'm not throwing it out but this was not a normal rookie season for any of the draftees.   Trae Young wasn't defined by his first half of the season he was terrible and continued to build on that success. Don't know why people keep up bringing Ant's terrible start (especially since this isn't a thread about ROTY or whatever). Should it not matter how he's playing now rather than 5 months ago?
Trae Young is better than Randle
Trae Young
I searched up 2018 draft big board and already found several boards with luka on top:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2781782-final-2018-nba-draft-big-board-who-will-take-our-top-prospect-luka-doncic  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-draft-2018-big-board-prospect-rankings-order-deandre-ayton-trae-young-jaren-jackson-jr/1ux40dxe8oh2z179oyxpcn7sqw  https://nbadraft.theringer.com/2018/  https://theathletic.com/400985/2018/06/21/the-athletic-philadelphia-nba-draft-big-board/
I would put Trae Young at #7 here
[Trae Young](https://youtu.be/8pAppNhXFUI)
"“How impressive is Robinson’s accomplishment? No other player in NBA history has even made 400 threes in their first 152 regular-season games.  Behind Robinson, Hornets guard Devonte’ Graham is next on the list with 384 made three-pointers in his first 152 games. Then comes Doncic (379 threes), Atlanta’s Trae Young (378 threes) and Portland’s Damian Lillard (374 threes).”"
"I mean isn't that true for like any young All-Star Level player, trae, zion, tatum anyone lol   Not getting injured and having longevity is the tough part"
Ancillary woosh. The joke is that T. Young refers to Trae + Thad Young in this game combined.

Lamelo is a poor mans Ja morant or trae young
"Yes he would make the perfect complement to MVP Cam Payne /s. Seriously though, Trae Young is somehow still ridiculously underrated. Can't wait for him to show out in the playoffs."
"Dude did the Trae Young and absolutely balled out this second half of the season. He erased any doubt and all those ""bust"" arguments. Ant man is the real deal."
Clarkson and Trae Young gotta be the worst beneficiaries of the refs not calling carries.  he has that hesi in his hand for like an hour lol
"Trae young gets screwed out of so many continuations, the NBA needs to to a better job of consistency on continuation calls."
Trae Young remains the most overrated player in the NBA tbh
"Trae Young looked like the worst player in the league for the first half of his rookie season, roughly what wiseman’s played. Second year he was an all star starter.   Jalen Brown looked *rough* for a bit too."
Then play 7 games against the Hawks. Ending with a Trae Young hail mary from half court at the buzzer.   Final score:  Wizards 110  Hawks 92
Dude Allen tripped like 3 different people and then he tried tripping Trae Young and hit Grant Williams in the NBA. Also if you think he’s handsome you must love birds. Dudes got a beak that he calls a nose
"&gt;they got a shot with a higher expected value than any team in the league has in transition this season  You're looking at the expected value of the *average* transition play, which includes plays where the offense doesn't even have the numbers advantage. 3-on-2 fast breaks have a much higher expected value (especially when Trae Young is one of the defenders)."
Defensively I'm going Trae Young and I'm 100% sure Trae would lock that dude up like Ben Simmons one on one with no help or rim protector.
\- Trae Young

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
Jonas Valanciunas - Travis Kelce  Trae Young - Tessio from The Godfather   RJ Barrett - Lil Yachty  Terry Rozier - undead Gregor Clegane
"We're on r/nba, you know there are people who will make that claim seriously.   Also, I was curious myself where Rubio would end up.   By the way, I missed on that list:  * Doncic * Trae Young * Isaiah Thomas * Goran Dragic - 50 * Jrue Holiday * De'Aaron Fox * Lowry * Mugsy Bogues * Avery Johnson * Jason Terry * Calderon * Tinsley * Ty Lawson * Bledsoe - 60 * Rafer Alston  So I think Rubio might actually be top 100 all time, even top 70 all time.  He was a starter in the NBA for 10 years, and he might have gotten a better reputation had he played on some good teams."
"dang. trae ""despite the loss"" young is stealing luka's nickname"
Yup trae young and his 10 freethrows tells us the refs are on our side
Come back and see Trae has 10 FTA. Just Trae Young things.
"Yeah Trae is overhated* too, no question. He’s probably the most overhated young player in the league. I think you’re right"
Trae young just runs directly into a person n gets the call LMAO
The comparison is that Trae Young is just as hated as them but it isn't countered at all by fans loving him.
Trae Young was a ballhog before Nate.  His defense is still very bad.
"It is absolutely Trae Young. While a lot of stars get hate like Westbrook and KD, they still have droves of fans. I'd say 90% of Trae Young's big fans are all Hawks fans too, everyone else seems to just seethe at him."
"What about it? Nate McMillan is ballin with a fairly well put together squad and no trae young, he’s got a team of good offensive players, as a defensive minded coach that seems to be a successful formula"
Yeah aint nobody proud of dropping 20 on Trae Young.  If I was Jrue I'd take it as a compliment that guys think highly enough of me to get hyped when they occasionally beat me.
And Trae Young took that personally
Trae Young
trae young in shambles
"Earlier this season people were legit saying they'd rather have sexton than morant because morant was declining or is god awful at 3s or some other crazy ass bullshit. It all kinda started when the trae young averaging 50 FT's a game shit was happening and a thread about trae, sexton, morant and someone else, and ranking them so everyone had trae at 1, whoever else at 2 and then a lot of morons were ssaying sexton over morant etc."
Cause Randle is a heck lot more likeable than Trae Young.  I will be rooting for the Knicks
wasn’t he like elbowing trae young
That’s cause no one watches the Grizzlies ofc. I didn’t watch the Grizz all year but from tonight it was obvious that not only does Ja have true floor general impact he does so much beyond the stat sheet offensively with so much ball movement and drawing defenders. Him and Trae Young are two of the most exciting young players in the league right now because they are capable of leading well built rosters to the playoffs at such a young age.
That would be Trae Young
Connecting Trae Young...  To the start of the NBA-ABA merger:  * Vince Carter * Charles Oakley * George Gervin  To the first NBA MVP:  * Vince Carter * Kevin Willis * Gus Williams * Jeff Mullins * Bob Pettit  To NBA Pioneer George Mikan:  * Vince Carter * Hakeem Olajuwon * Cedric Maxwell * John Havlicek * Clyde Lovelette * George Mikan
"Average is a surprisingly high bar in the NBA. I feel like I can name 15 better passers than Steph. In no particular order (mostly going by team record this year), Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Jokic/Lebron if they count, Trae Young, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, Westbrook, Rubio, Lamelo, Lowry, Vanvleet and Wall is 16. I’d probably put Derozan as well but idk if I’d call him a point guard."
It was not a huge surprise to anyone who was lying attention. He was a legit Max player. It would be like having trae young come off the bench.
Mvp ; andre drummond  Dpoy ; trae young  Don’t @ me
"How neither Julius Randle or Trae Young makes this list when both are leading new teams to the playoffs for the first time is baffling to me.  A great playoff performance by either of them could spell something huge for the East but no it’s super interesting how Lebron James, a known factor performs?"
Love to see these young stars rise to the occasion. Trae Young next 😤😤
"Even though I'm not a fan, I would consider starting Frank and putting him in Trae. I think his D would frustrate Young."
Does he do the Trae Young hop into the defender thing here or am i hating?
Grayson Allen tried to foul bait you not Trae young bro😭
There's no real pressure on Trae Young but how he fares this playoff will really shape his narrative for the next couple of years. If the Hawks can hold up defensively then a lot of concerns will be alleviated.
Trae Young literally makes the basketball seem like a yoyo
MVP - Klay Thompson  DPOY - Trae Young  6MOTY - Aron Baynes  ROY - James Wiseman  MIP - Kelly Oubre  COY - Luke Walton  JWK Citizenship Award - Meyers Leonard
I wonder if Trae Young flops in practice
1. Kyle Korver 2. Domonique Wilkins  3. Paul Milsap  4. John Collins  5. Trae Young  6. Steph Curry  7. Kevin Durant   8. Giannis  9. Siakam  10. Sabonis
No particular order  Dominique Wilkins   Shawn kemp   Charles Barkley   Carmelo Anthony   Trae young   Dwight Howard   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Dame   Kent Bazemore
1. Dominique Wilkins 2. Dikembe Mutombo 3. Greivis Vasquez (Maryland fan) 4. Paul Millsap 5. Shawn Kemp 6. Clint Capela 7. Trae Young 8. Ben Wallace 9. Dennis Rodman 10. Derrick Rose
Agree to disagree but MDA has taken numerous teams to the conference finals with highly skilled shooting and playmaking lead ball handlers.  Trae Young could be in the MVP conversation with MDA hell it's not like MDA doesn't have experience with Capella too.
"Bring back rights for defensive players. Offensive players should not be able to encroach on a defensive players space and has a foul called in their favor. It rewards bad offense.   Lou Williams, James Harden, Trae Young, and Lillard are all craftsmen to varying degrees. I don’t blame them for it but it sucks to watch (doubt I’m saying anything controversial here)"
"**Trae Young deserves better than MDA.**  How many times would say MDA made a difference in a BIG game? I’ve seen him do it with our rotations since he joined us. He’s developed players’ confidence for us, something that I have not seen Mike do lately. MDA is 70, Nate is 59. Agree to disagree"
I don’t know I feel pretty happy having I value system I apply consistently.  If it came out tomorrow that the same exact facts surrounding D rose happened with Trae Young I would drop his ass so fast and if the hawks didn’t let him go I would drop them too.
MDA may not fit the timeline but if he's available he's automatically a top ten coach in the league and fits Trae Young and his playstyle considering he's coached similar players to MVPs and Nate has done nothing in the postseason except 2nd round disappointment.
"I mean, Gafford &amp; Hutch didn't play much, and we got Theis to replace WCJ. I think thats a net + on defense.   Please refrain from making comments on stuff you are not knowledgeable of. Imagine not having Trae Young for 3 weeks after a major trade, then having some Bulls fan say your defense sucks after said trade, and that's why you lost those games. Stupid, right?"
Oh empty stats? Great argument man. I thought this sub was done with that BS after Trae Young and Devin Booker.
Steve Nash said Trae Young doesn’t play “real basketball” whatever the fuck that means
"Man what a fun time to be a hawks fan. This team is stacked with hunter and Collins who will probably develop Wel defensive. Capella, contra to his prior years, was an elite rim protector this year. I was wrong about him. Then you get to trae young who’s the closest to Nash since, Nash. He is a problem on defense but maybe they’ll be able to hide him.   They’re more dangerous than people think they’re just young and inexperienced"
"Lol he was just terrible. An undersized guard who couldn't defend, couldn't rebound, averaged less than 1 assist per game for his entire career, and took terrible shots every time he stepped on the floor.  He played like he thought he was Kobe, but he had a 2pt % of .424...  He was the quintessential guy who shines in high school or maybe even college by being a better shooter than everybody around him but when he gets to the big leagues he's shit at everything else and his shooting isn't good enough to make up for it.  Imagine Trae Young, but he never passes, is somehow a much worse defender, shoots under 70% at the FT line and isn't that good of a jump shooter either."
Trae Young is the soyboy version of Embiid
Can't wait for weeks of Trae Young bitching about not getting every touch foul
"Only two teammates separate Trae Young and Bird, and only 4 teammates separate Trae Young and Bill Russell."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

Trae Young and Tiny Archibald are only 4 teammates apart
"Trae Young and Olajuwon are only separated by Vince Carter, because of that year Hakeem had in Toronto. Oh, and because Vince played for about 800 years.   I don't know why I find this so weird, but I do. Also, Vince Carter is kind if a cheat code in this."
"Or you can say that Jordan doesn’t win his titles if he doesn’t have the defensive help of Rodman and Pippen. Trae Young currently is a turntable at defense that teams constantly exploit. Even though he averages 20-25 points per game, so does his matchup"
"&gt; He was asked what his thoughts were that national media overwhelmingly chose the Knicks to win the series. And Nate response was they’re pulling for the Knicks and a lot of it has to do with them being the bigger market.  knicks have been getting roasted and the butt of all jokes from sports media for idk, 20 years now....make the playoffs with a roster no one thought would win 25 games, and now the knicks are the big bad all of a sudden?    meanwhile, the league has been rolling the red carpet out for trae young ever since he joined the league, giving him star calls and press even though he's done nothing in the nba."
Hawks fans with a straight face pre complaining about the refs. Meanwhile if you think about trae young you get a foul called on you.
"This is literally so fucking cool.   I did Joe Johnson &amp; Lebron James, Terry Rozier &amp; Larry Bird, and Dominique Wilkins and Trae Young. The UI layout is incredibly intuitive. 100/100, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
He should try being Trae Young.
I know they played thru trae young 👀
4 for Trae young and Kareem Abdul Jabar
&gt;The Knicks’ best player is a poor man’s Zion Williamson  “Tell me you’ve never watched Julius Randle without telling me you’ve never watched Julius Randle”  &gt;The Hawks’ best player is a dollar tree version of Steph Curry  “Tell me you’ve never watched Trae Young without saying you’ve never watched Trae Young.”
"What's funny is Simmons is already eating crow on that. He put out a video on the Ringer saying that he thinks the Hawks will shoot the lights out of the Knicks and if he had to bet on one young player coming out of the playoffs as a red hot superstar, it's Trae Young."
"Everyone you try to connect to Trae Young, is connected via Vince Carter."
"Slimy coach and a slimy player in Trae Young. Don't expect much with the Hawks. One blames the team sucking on officiating bias and the ""star"" player needs fouls to get points."
"There’s usually only a guy or 2 in every draft like that anyway. People overreact. Last year it was Zion and Ja. Year before that Luka and Trae Young. Year before that it’s basically just Tatum. Year before that is Ben Simmons. Year before that it’s just KAT. Year before that is Embiid. Year before that, 2013, was pretty bad in the lottery anyway so I’m going to stop there lmao."
"If he said just that it would've been fine. He could've said it with a smile on his face, like "" I'm sure the league is happy a big market is in the playoffs, but it's our job to make sure that happiness fades fast"" perfectly fine statement, right? Instead though, He says that the league is probably so happy for this situation that the impartial referees they employee are going to have a servere bias against them. That's where he gets fined.  If thibadeau said "" Trae young is a huge star in the league and the league obviously wants to promote him as a face of the league, so we now the refs will have a bias against us, bc obviously they want one of their bright future stars to advance, and not a random collection of role players who needed a change of scenery to succeed"" You can't imply that refs are bad at their job and not get fined that's pretty much a standard. Players and coaches even start critiscms about refs with "" i know this is going to cost me, but..."""
One degree from Muggsy bogues and Trae Young  Vince carter
"Lol I love the phrase ""refuses to learn how to shoot."" Like Ben doesn't see how having a jumper would make his game better and make him more money as a result. Or he does but doesn't care. That's like saying Trae Young refuses to grow six inches.   Anyway, it's funny because people only say this for the playoffs as if the blueprint is always there but only in the playoffs do teams implement it. Like they don't care if they win or not in the regular season. Also when people say ""the playoffs"" they're really only talking about the two series in the second round in which they lost (and the one against the Raptors Butler shared ball handling duties and was the secondary and sometimes primary scorer while Ben was the fifth option but anyway) because against the Heat and Nets in the first rounds he had no problem playing his game and helping his team to victory. Without Embiid for some of those games.   So we're already dealing with a small sample size because you're talking about two playoff runs the most recent of which was two seasons ago. But now what we're really talking about is like 11 games against two teams when he had two vastly different roles.   But yet people act like Ben is basically a 15 year vet and we know what he will be in the playoffs because of the numerous past examples. It kills me man. People put way too much stock, good and bad, in such small as sample sizes. Like when actual NBA analysts said, on live TV, that Mitchell and Murray were going to be MVP candidates this season because they scored a bunch against each other in on bubble series. It's wild man."
and used wildly incorrectly by trae young recently. how's he gonna silence his own fans lmao
"I don't think he was making that point, I think it was more in regards to how the upcoming series will be called.  The refs will refuse to call and 1's for expert foul drawer Trae Young and every Hawks fan will scream conspiracy."
"Yeah but to pretend that the statement wasn't made to affect the narrative around Trae Young not getting those soft ticky tack foul draws he relies on during the series, now it's because the league pressured the refs to help the Knicks win, not because they're the better team.  If the refs call the game in a way that looks like it's in favor of the Knicks at all, everyone will point to what this guy said.    I don't see a lot of statements of people saying that he doesn't think we deserve to be in the playoffs, and no shit the NBA is balls deep in the story of a big market franchise being garbage for the last two decades looking as good as they were in the 90s.    But his comment was absolutely regarding how the upcoming series will be called and what narratives the media will closely follow."
I feel dirty. Hakeem to Trae Young is just Vince Carter. Gave me flashbacks of Hakeem on the Raptors.
Only three degrees of separation between Dominique Wilkins and Trae Young because Vince Carter fought father time with fervor
It’s hilarious considering that they have Trae Young on their team
"lmao Knick fans really hate Trae Young, and this was well before the upcoming playoff series."
"yeah it’s frustrating the way a lot of people view the NBA. there’s more dudes balling out like crazy than probably ever before, but people just want to shit on anyone who isn’t their favorite player. i just wanna sit back and watch Curry, Dame, Harden, Luka, Trae Young, Beal, etc do their thing."
Yes. There's a reason trae young averages 9 freethrows per game. The refs are clearly biased towards the hawks and trae's flopping and jumping into defenders nonsense.
realistically... three currently playing that have already unequivocally reached legend status.  Lebron  Curry  Trae Young
"My opinion: He's fun, but to me at least he's more in the Fox/Mitchell tier - they're very good young players with room to grow, but they don't do anything that makes me want to watch their games right this second, if they're not playing my team.   That could absolutely change as Ja develops, but for now I'd rather watch someone like Zion or Luka or Trae."
Curry did the stop on the dime Trae Young foul multiple times under the basket and nobody says a word.  Trae does it and it's not a basketball play and everyone hates on him for it.
"It never ceases to amaze and disgust me how Trae Young is in the NBA for 5 minutes and gets many more calls than a 2 time MVP, 3 time champion, absolute first-ballot HOF lock legend like Curry."
Nobody is shutting down Trae young in the post season lol.  People think that because he’s amazing at drawing fouls that he doesn’t play with heart.  Y’all are about to learn.  This guy is most effective with a chip on his shoulder.
"The defense thing is probably the one actually legitimate criticism of his overall body of work (mostly early Houston days though). It was particularly frustrating because it wasn't a Trae Young-type situation where he's not built for it physically, he was just saving his stamina for offense."
"Trae Young shall face off against his French nemesis, Trés Jeune."
"*And Trae Young checks out with a rare -3/2/6 statline, his only shot that made it into a basket he accidentally shot into the Knicks basket*"
No. I don’t think they fix games for Trae Young. I think he exploits the system. It’s a case by case basis. Refs lean heavily towards some teams in some games.   I think they favor the Lakers more than most teams because they have the biggest fan base and Lebron’s on there. But even with the Lakers it’s not every game.
Curry is arguably the biggest superstar in the league and fucking Trae Young gets more calls.
Trae Young time
Trae young. Maybe lebron
Just saw my first live Trae Young Foul Bait  It gave me goosebumps. It was surreal. I have dreamt of this moment for the past 2 years watching highlights on youtube. I was jealous of everyone who had saw it live before. But now i am part of that group. Let me tell you it feels good. To any other new NBA fan who is striving to see those free throws live. You will get there. Just stay focused. Your moment will come.  Thank you Ice Trae.
Trae “Finally made the playoffs just to get bounced by the Knicks” Young  😂😂😂
"Saying Schroder, KCP, THT and a pick for Lowry is not anything like saying trading Maxey, who is worse then those three players by a lot (not even counting the pick), for Trae Young, who is better then Lowry by a solid bit.  What a terrible comparison."
"Thats like saying the Sixers could trade Tyrese Maxey for Trae Young. Sure it CAN happen but that would be absolutely fucking stupid for Atlanta, the Lakers physically could have traded those pieces but the Raptors would be FUCKING STUPID to take that deal."
I am honestly shocked that Lebron didnt pull a Trae Young and just hit the breaks there and have Draymond run into him for a foul.  Dray is making AD his bitch and the only way that will change is if Dray isnt in the game anymore
"I don’t think it’ll be quite that bad. Trae Young really has captured the city, and their ticket sales and regional tv viewership are way up, not to mention the pent up desire to do pre-COVID things.  I still think Knicks fans will show out, but I don’t think it will be quite that bad. Again, Atlanta does typically pull in a decent crowd for the playoffs"
Off-topic but I can’t help but think that in the playoffs Trae Young will be absolutely terrible and just get targeted every single possession.
I still remember Trae Young airballs being posted and people calling him a bust
"I'd say its worth it for the Knicks. Elf's one NBA ability is penetrating but he has zero idea what to do with the ball once he gets in the paint. I read he's 39% from 3-10 feet this year, so even if he beats his man its likely useless. Frank can at least defend Trae well enough and disrupt passing lanes, which is probably what we gotta do to limit Trae. If that means Trae gets to take it easy defensively a little then so be it. The last thing we want is Young going off, which he consistently has done against Elf."
Defense doesn't matter as much because of that its no where near as important as offense for an individual player. If offense and defense were equal Matisse Tybulle would be as good as Trae Young is.
"Tom Thibodeau, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Kings game. You need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"Still got a lot of time to see how it plays out. I think it's still a good trade.   For some reason, this sub loves long ass rebuilds assuming all rookies are going to pan out. I remember the Hawks got criticized for ""rushing the rebuild"" paying Gallo and Bogi because of Trae Young's desire to win but now we're the 4th seed. I would 100% give up a Cade or Green for slightly overpaid players to get into the playoff push.  Something tells me the Chicago Bulls would do the same. The Chicago Bulls are an awkward fitting team. Way too many question marks about roles, players, and skill. The Bulls are trying to maximize LaVine's all-star prime before he leaves or it goes to waste. Why should the Bulls just sit and wait for another rookie to come in and grow when LaVine needs help now? Another All-Star is more important that the current playoff window.   And it's not dumb to try and get a playoff push right now. No matter what, LaVine is going to want to win. It would honestly be unfair to put rookies into that situation with a bunch of young guys telling them to make the playoffs immediately. Vooch is ready right now."
"It's definitely a stat that needs context and &lt;gasp&gt; game-watching to provide that context. Look at some other names in the ""top"" 30 for players with highest TOV% and we see: Ben Simmons, Facundo Campazzo, Ricky Rubio, LaMelo Ball, Goran Dragic, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Ja Morant, LeBron James. What these guys all have in common is that they don't take many shots ***relative*** to how much ball handling they do. For sure a couple guys (Trae and LeBron especially) shoot and score a lot, but they do *even more* ball handling relative to their teammates."
"love ben but i disagree so much with his list  just no way you can look at what Randle did and not think hes an allstar. who in his spot is getting New York to where theyre at this season? trae young got a worse record with a better supporting cast, KAT averages more points than wins, jamal was hella inconsistent through the first month, jrue never did what randles done even playing with AD, middleton was the third most valuable player on his team, draymond?? completely unserious and then you have him not even making the sub all star team like what? marcus smart is not better than randle nor is he better than lavine, vooch, russ, derozan or jaylen"
Just fuck trae young huh
"The Lamelo angle is a great point. It reminds me of the Kings taking Marvin Bagley with Doncic and Trae Young still on the board. Ugly pick that just gets worse and worse with each passing year.  As it stands currently, the Warriors are going to have to draft another Steph Curry to ever have a chance at competing for a championship. And we all know that won't happen.  Its sad that other Warriors fan don't think Curry is even worth the effort to compete now. Even after all he's done this season, the fanbase is ready to close the door on Curry and start anew with the next generation"
Now if this was trae young... yall better keep that same energy if trae has a high FT game thats all im saying
Give it a week and you can add Trae young to that list lol
"""Make Trae Young actually shoot the basketball because all he does is shoot free throws.""  Honestly he's not wrong"
Kemba hasn’t mastered the art of foul baiting like the great trae young
Cena and Vin as brothers is as believable as Trae Young having a full head of hair
"Scott Brooks, there is a way to beat the Hawks. Please watch the Kings game. You need to stop Trae Young P&amp;R by having the guard go over the pick and the big man drop to prevent penetration. If Trae stops and pulls-up mid-range, that is a win."
"I wasn't one of those lame Mfers mad because Trae was out there dropping 30 and 11 every night launching it from half court.  What Trae needed was some dogs out there who can go get 20 and 25 a game with him.  I wanted to see a movement of young dudes in Atlanta, dropping 130 a game.  But they let all that bitch and moaning from nerds who don't understand that basketball is about entertainment first. They dragged in some lame ass players that play the ""right way"". Now the Hawks the slowest damn team in the league .  They got that bullshit ass Lebron 2010 Cavs offense going. Slow as fuck and play Defense and hit 3s.  Look, I rather drop 30 and 10 every night and win than drop 24 and 8 and win.  Let Trae play his way."
He was actual ass. Randle at least did something Bullock got smoked on defense and did nothing while getting guarded by Trae Young on offense
"and the inverse for the Hawks.  Can't get more intense than playing at MSG with everyone screaming ""F__ck Trae Young"" in what was the first playoff game for their young players."
"Totally agree. My goal coming into the season was to win a playoff series (yes, I genuinely believed that before the season started) See how Trae performs in high-pressure situations, and get this good young core some experience in the playoffs and hopefully gain some confidence moving forward. Looks like we’re on track for all of that to become reality. Winning a playoff series is so critical to our future, and that’s all I really cared about. Once we close the Knicks, it’s all gravy and house money from there"
"The Knicks have missed their fair share of open shots, but our defense is also underrated. Yeah, Trae isn't a great defender, but everyone else in the starting 5 is above average with Capella and Hunter being great. Both teams have young, inexperienced guys starting but the Hawks just have more depth and talent so I think that's the biggest reason as to why they're losing, instead of the ""not ready for the playoffs"" take."
"Trae Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, John Collins, and Kevin Huerter had never played in the playoffs before this season either."
he is guarded by trae young. and he dropped zero.   u can try and deflect or contextualize all u want. that shit is SAD!!!!!!!!!!!
"This obviously sucks for the Knicks but they didn’t even expect to get here at the start of the season, and have a promising young squad. Sucks but it’s good experience to build upon. Also Trae is a fucking monster, what a talent."
"You guys have been the Trae Young defense squad for 3 years now. Every fanbase has said the same shit, they just weren't in a playoff series. We're just happy to be here."
No excuse for the Knicks. We have been dreadful the past 2 games.  Great game Atlanta. You all have showed up big in this series. Trae is cold af. The coaching staff clearly studied film and have stopped us in every way possible.  You guys are a great young team and your defense has been great.  I would definitely sign Nate up after this run.   Hopefully we can at least win one more in the Garden. But it's hard to see us win this series.
"NBA Fans: I miss when players talked trash and we're tough  Also NBA Fans: Clown talking trash when he lost.  Like do people know how talking trash works. Props to Trae, he's backed it up this series. Deserves a ton of credit.  But still....  Fuck Trae Young."
I’m starting to really like Trae Young.   He has an entire fanbase hating on him and what does he do? Fucking dominates their team. Love to see it.
Trae Young has been dominating this series. What a fucking talent.
This was a great series and then boom Trae Young said nah let’s end it in 5
"The Bigger Picture:  Rj Barrett is a bust.  Randle is good but when double-teamed he can't produce and he's not a good passer either.  For the ATL - Trae Young is an All-Star, Bogi is a Star, D Hunter is a Star.  Still have Cam Reddish too."
I want Trae Young to talk trash non-stop in game 5
Should someone tell Trae Young you’re not supposed to shampoo everyday?
27 and 9 for Norman High and Oklahoma Sooners basketball legend Trae Young.
Those overrated chants are going toward trae young that mf so overrated lmfoaoooo
Trae young not even getting a double double smh
Trae Young is a current superstar.
I love Trae Young.  Go Sooners
Trae Young claiming more lives in New York than Andrew Cuomo.   Twitter is nuts lmao
Remember that Trae Young was 16th in ESPNs top 25 under 25.
Trae Young playing like a faster hybrid form of Steph and Nash.   Unbelievable in this series.
Trae Young bad amirite? Upvotes to the left.
"Hawks have just a lot more talent its that simple. Trae Young is a future superstar. They are a deep squad. The Knicks are starting Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Reggie Bullock."
"Trae young haters can’t talk about “empty stats” now, find a new slant"
Hawks motion offense. Trae Young is just a wizard with finding players in their spots.   Needed more anticipatory switching on the cutters and shooters.
"this series is only about Trae Young.. they had no answer for him all series..  If they tried him one on one he was blowing past them, hitting floaters or hitting the open guy as their defense collapsed..  If they doubled him he just made the right play every time"
"Y'all can say ""Fuck Trae Young"" but your mothers already did."
Some Knicks fans in their gamethread wishing injury on Trae Young  lame af
When bad offense meets bad defense. Seriously. Any competent team with a competent coach would be targeting Trae Young on defense every time down the floor.
"Against the knicks lol. The KNICKS. Any other team is up on defense and not letting them get shots off. Once trae young is shut down, so is Atlanta."
Btw... How sick would an ant Edwards and Trae Young backcourt be? We love him in Minny and will never let him leave (hopefully) but it would be so cool to have him with Trae in the ATL
"the virgin ""fuck trae young"" vs the chad ""OVERRATED"""
Damnit needed that Trae Young double double
"Just draft a Trae Young, ez"
"At least they know how to organize a ""Trae Young is balding"" chant."
"If your gameplan is to not attack Trae Young when he is on defense, you might need to change your gameplan."
"Trae Young hasn’t - a ton of other guys like Gallo, Lou, Capella have been in a ton of huge playoff/CF games"
Trae Young always give us trouble.  We’ll really have to work on defense.    Sixers in 5.
so was the knicks fans fuck trae young chant 😂
That simply cant be right? Trae Young has literally never played the game of basketball.
"I’ll always remember Westbrook as a player that refused to accept that a mid-range pull up is a bad shot based on scoring efficiency.  The #1 scouting report on Trey Young is to let him shoot mid rangers, not because he can’t make them but because it’s the most inefficient shot in the game.  Trae refuses to shoot the mid ranger and still goes to the hoop for a short floater or kick out 3."
Absolute delusion if you think this sub is still hating on Trae Young
"Speak for yourself, as a neutral in this serie, I fucking love Trae Young!"
I think Trae Young is a likeable player
Bill deblasio told me the knicks were going to teach trae young a lesson
"r/nba is/was definitely rooting for the knicks, this sub hates trae young"
"Trae Young should start getting dressed, buttoning up his coat on the sideline"
Noel hits the ground like he's Trae young size. He got the stability of a newborn.
Trae Young will win an MVP. See you in 6 years!
basketball gods didn’t enjoy the fuck trae young chants
Trae Young told Knicks fans we going back the A. Man the Garden better be absolutely bonkers in game 5 for the Knicks to have any chance. I’m talking Malice in the Palace level bonkers lmao
"They were one of the hottest teams in the NBA towards the end of the season, they were shutting teams down on defense and Julius Randle was playing extremely well. His play right now is basically the reason the knicks have been looking so bad and Trae Young smoking us lol"
"I hate that trae young does the inbound thing every possession, smart with the lead though"
Dude excuse me what the hell. I've been missing some absurd crossovers not watching Trae Young more!
Trae Young working on a Sunday??? — NY Tabloids
"Just a reminder that this Knicks roster wasn’t exactly constructed with the postseason in mind and they’ve played above their talent level all year. ATL was trying to push for the playoffs this year, they’ve got more talent, and they’re playing like it. Yes Julius is playing like absolute shit, but our role players aren’t doing anything to take away those soft doubles ATL is throwing at them. Trae Young wouldn’t be nearly as effective as he is if the Hawks role players shot like the Knicks’ role players do"
Knicks fans were criticized for chanting “fuck Trae Young.” And not being creative.
That boy Trae Young is 🥶 🥶 🥶
She’s been sucking off on trae young get that narrative out.
Trae young has completely changed the narrative about him. Good for him
Julius “All NBA” Randle versus Trae “not an all star” Young
Trae Young is just the best player on the floor and (except maybe D Rose) it isnt even close.
Imagine your defensive strategy to stop Trae Young is putting Reggie Bullock on him lmao
Trae Young has turned into one of my favorite players in just 3.5 games
Trae young is playing great it's a shame hes such a bitch
DPOY TRAE YOUNG
only thing trae young has ever done on defense
Trae young: defensive stopper
Afraid to attack that midget trae fucking young?
Trae young successfully defending the 2 on 1. Wow he's made huge strides on D.
"I haven't been able to watch much of the Knicks-hawks series, but the hawks have struggled defensively this year and have a number of individual defensive liabilities that get substantial playing time, particularly trae young, yet the Knicks haven't been able to generate offense. From what I've been able to watch it doesn't appear that the Knicks have really even attempted to matchup hunt for trae/Lou/Gallo/etc. Especially with randle struggling this seems like an easy way to generate offense and try to get him in rhthym. What am I missing? Are the hawks hiding him well?"
Trae Young just defended a 2 on 1 fastbreak lol
makes me happy trae young is gonna send this bitch ass team packing in MSG :)
Trae Young really gonna Reggie Miller the Knicks.
Trae. Young.
The difference is Trae young. Hawks can't win without him.
"Trae Young is on the bench thinking bad thoughts right now, prepare for a scorching second half"
The best gillette commercial I can think of is Trae Young shaving his nasty head
Lmao Knicks fans chanting Fuck Trae Young 2 min into game one but Randle apparently needs to be treated with kid gloves
What did Trae young do to warrant all the shit he got in Madison square garden in game 1?
"Y’all realize your star is Trae Young, right?"
Bruh don’t y’all have Trae Young lmao
"Trae Young is single, this sommer some girl gonna catch him for eighteen years"
He got hit by Trae young and acted like he got shot. Embellishment
[How Trae Young styles his hair in the morning](https://www.google.com/search?q=play+doh+crazy+cuts&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjv66nS__HwAhVxQUIHHeaMBvUQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=play+doh+crazy+cuts&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYOgQIIxAnOgQIABBDUPzJAVjS4QFg1-IBaABwAHgAgAH4AogB5ROSAQgwLjExLjIuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=TtSzYO-MHfGCieoP5pmaqA8&amp;bih=720&amp;biw=414&amp;prmd=sivn&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS784US784&amp;hl=en-US#imgrc=hVgXEK1paG1WTM)
You literally root for Trae Young lmao
Trae young is so lucky that the Knicks don't force him to actually play defense for most of the game
How is Trae Young bitching about actually hitting a guy in the head?
Ah yes the people surely are more interested in Taj Gibson than Trae Young 🤣
"Everyone in the replies really just fell for a post like this from a guy named TRAE-YOUNG-BETTER, lmfao"
"Sometimes I wonder if I'm too critical with national announcers on ESPN because I'm either a homer Knicks fan or I'm spoiled with the Breen/Frazier tandem but I'm sorry, the last few minutes have been a Boris gushing about Young and the Hawks. Cool, yes I know that Trae is special because he's 6'1 180lbs, a good passer, went to Oklahoma vs Texas Tech that his father went to. Taj scores a tough hook and it's suddenly about Capella being 4th in block shots? How about saying something how Taj has been critical in filling in for Robinson this season?"
I don’t get that though . Taj and Reggie bullock at the point in their career where they just play basketball and do very little talking . Trae young literally talking shit to them is lame af
Pep Guardiola would play Trae Young as a center
Trae Young is the type of player that Luka thinks he is
Trae Young is who Luka thinks he is
Trae Young baits more fouls than LeBron does.   A weak breeze could also blow him over and he'd get Mother Nature called for a foul
Trae Young is a top 10 player in the NBA right now
"Yes, as a counter example watch someone who never complains like Trae Young or Lebron or James Harden. Their civility has resulted in them never going to the line, zero superstar treatment"
trae young
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nv78b8/callie_caplan_donnie_nelson_if_mavs_will_try_to/h11sq0v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3  This is something else you wrote  You’re comparing trae young playing the damn knicks to luka playing the clips  Idk if you’re just young or what, but you don’t use your brain in any of your arguments  Not wasting my time anymore lol"
"NGL I want the roster to be mainly young players. BI, Zion, Bam, Tatum, Trae those types of players. Maybe add Mobely or Cade as the requisite college player."
"Hijacking this top comment to also put in the factors of:  * The NBA finally has an _actual_ superstar/household name playing in the Eastern playoffs again (KD). And the bonus is that he's playing with two other extremely popular players (Kyrie, and to some extent Harden). * The Knicks made the playoffs, and they've been one of the biggest latent markets for a while * Trae Young made the playoffs, and he's been one of the more hyped younger players"
"I'm not really commenting on who's the better player or anything (though that fact is crazy in hindsight). I'm just saying that Trae is a more ""marketable"" star. He's young with a very exciting playstyle and an attitude."
"He said luka apparently which gave me the impression he’s slow to recognize. Honestly this nets team has surprised me by dismantling who I thought was the best or 2nd best team in the east. But Lukas supporting cast is way worse than Giannis but way more suited to his skills. Clippers I think are probably the best team left in the west and I realistically expect a gentleman’s sweep by the 6ers, barring Trae young throwing his dick on the table. All this to say I’d put Giannis just slightly ahead of luka because of defense. Both have insane offensive games but need the right supporting players and Giannis obviously does not despite all they did this offseason. Both are clearly too 8 players and above that is all subjective"
How is embiid not bigger than Trae young
"Trae Young is about to have 30 FTs with this reffing crew. You'll be fine, the Sixers are going to get fucked for any amount of aggressiveness on defense."
"I definitely think so. A starting lineup of Luka with SGA, Mikal Bridges, JJJ and Ayton would be great defensively as well as offensively. Then have Trae Young lead the second unit with MPJ and Miles Bridges, Robinson etc... Absolutely stacked, I think that team easily makes it to conference finals. Starters and bench players can be switched depending on matchups and so forth"
The cold shivering thing by Trae Young. For that matter Ice Trae is a top tier nickname too.
- I don’t mind Steph being eliminated tbh we’ve seen enough of the Warriors over the last few years. And also I really like Ja Morant anyways  - Kinda annoying but the Clippers were also favorites in every game so it shouldn’t be a surprise  - Trae Young can annoying at a few times but I think he’s a very exciting player to watch most of the time. Lowkey growing on me. Also I really like this Hawks team.  - I was rooting for The Suns and I didn’t want the Lakers to repeat so I’m happy about this  Those last two things are probably the only bad things thus far in my opinion. I’m also from New Jersey so I was fine seeing the Celtics go out too.
"do you think you are actually making compelling arguments right now  our teams both lost in the first round buddy.  trae young is in the second round and luka is not.  and the knicks have a bad roster, the mavericks have a MVP.  it makes more sense for us to lose than you.   your team was up 2-0"
We have an MVP caliber player that lost to a two-time MVP finals player.   You have scrubs and the anointed Knicks savior and most improved player and still lost to fucking Trae Young and Clint Capela .   🤣
"Is super teams even doing this? That seems like a weird claim to put this all on the Nets lol   Return of fans, young stars like Trae and Luka in some big series', Lebron and AD vs CP3 in the first round.   I'd argue there's a lot of other factors"
At least we played against a two time finals MVP and took them to 7 games.   Y’all were fucking blown out by Trae Young and co in their first playoffs.  🤣   Y’all should hide in a corner and keep quiet.
Trae young?
Not really. Reads more as a comparison between playoff success for physical players in the modern NBA vs more skill players like we're seeing with the success of Trae Young who's never even been in the playoffs before this season.
"I believe Jay. What is said in public is totally different than behind closed doors. Seriously, put yourself in KD's shoes, would you want to be compared to Giannis? Just because KD praised Giannis years ago doesn't mean that he's opened to being compared to him. You can talk to any superstar player in the league behind closed doors and I'm sure you would get the same sentiments from each of them if you tried comparing them to another lesser player. Ask Steph about the Trae Young comparisons behind closed doors, I'm positive you would get a different answer than if Steph were asked in public, not necessarily flattering, either."
"Most of the NBA carries or travels accidentally from time to time.  But Durant carries on every crossover more of less. When he's taking on a serious defender, the ball is getting burger flipped.  I'd say Durant and Isaiah Thomas (Boston) were/are the two perpetual carry abusers. Trae Young is studying to abuse every advantage he can find as well. We'll see."
"Franchise record for 3s means little to nothing when it’s our first playoffs in 5 years. Every team shoots significantly more 3s than they did 5 years ago. There’s no way that you don’t know this.  This loss at home must really be painful for you, since it seems like your takes about the Hawks definitely not making the playoffs, or Trae Young being a net negative player, or Bogi being a godawful signing aged pretty poorly, didn’t they?"
6 free throw attempts for Curry is literally nothing when you watch how he’s guarded lol wth. dude gets held and mauled off ball constantly. 6 attempts per game was also a career high for him.  even players like lillard and trae young average more free throws than steph. so idk what your point is with him “being 6’3”
The best story will be Trae Young owning the city of Phoenix
They need to switch everything and force trae to go one on one. You cannot guard the pnr with trae young
Nah I want a Trae Young vs Booker finals
Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker Trae Young Jayson Tatum
Trae Young gonna shoot a three on this post.
&gt;Trae are young  this lead me to check if trae young's middle name start's with an R (shut up)  turns out it starts with a T. It's Trae.  But his first name is RAYMOND WHICH START WITH AN R  &gt;!trae are young more like are trae young but im not a rapper!&lt;
"Agreed, it is well overdue for Trae Young to get some official recognition"
About putting Simmons on Trae. Danny green ain't stopping young
Imagine Giannis with Trae Young
"1st clip: Ben tries to fight over the screen and gets too close to Trae, bumping Trae and affecting Trae's SQBR.   Soft foul? Consider that Ben weighs 240 while Young weighs 180. A ""bump"" of equal force will obviously affect someone like Trae more than someone like Capela.   2nd clip: Hard to tell from this angle, but it looks like Ben's right arm/hand grabs/ gets tangled with Trae's left arm/hand, again affecting Trae's SQBR.  In both clips, especially the 2nd one,  the ref is right on top of the play with a clear view of the action.   In today's NBA, those are both fouls and will be called all the time."
"Mitchell and Trae are young, they can wait their turn haha"
funnest fact: trae young and ayton have both gotten past the first round of the playoffs while luka has not
"Trae is like this at times as well, I think a lot of the young guys are going for the viral video highlights instead of the good basketball play"
Because most fans hate Trae Young
Fuck we are struggling with Trae Young. No way we stop James Fucking Harden and Kevin Durant and Kyrie shiit
Dame was pretty unstoppable against the nuggets. Curry was dropping 32 ppg while being triple teamed. Luka was responsible for 31/37 of the Dallas Mavericks baskets that one game. Tatum and D-book dropped 50 and 47 (respectively) to beat good teams. Joel Embiid I’d Joel Embiid. And Trae Young can’t be stopped by DPOY candidate Ben Simmons. And Kawhi terminated the mavs.  This league has so many unstoppable offensive threats
This sub loves Curry but hates Trae Young
How is Curry losing in the play in a nightmare How is Trae Young playing well a nightmare
Watching Trae Young getting 100 fouls per game  is not that entertaining tbh
Lol imagine putting jrue in the same sentence as the rest of those guys or even putting him over trae young. Clown take
Trae Young is a reason to watch Eastern conference games.
"His problem in Indiana was the fact that his idea of coaching offense is running isolation for 48 minutes.   That can work with Trae Young. To an extent.  It’ll work until it doesn’t. He won’t make any adjustments once it stops working, and then you have your McMillan ceiling."
Just give him Trae Young
Or Trae Young
&gt; Joel Embiid’s meniscus might be the only thing standing between ~~the Nets~~ Trae Young and a few clean sweeps to the finals
Booker was crazy good game 6. He is in the wait and see category with trae young. Sample size is too small for both.
Trae Young is one of them.
"Would need to do something important in the playoffs, which for the Nets, they won’t play real competition like Joel Embiid or Trae Young until round 3.  Sometimes you can be a big contributor while barely playing though. KD in the 2019 finals is a good example. Had Klay not gotten injured and they won in 7, even though KD only played 12 minutes, those 12 minutes were needed for the Warriors to win the hypothetical championship."
Just roll the ball in like Trae young and let the clock go to zero lmao
I’m excited for Trae Young vs the Nets!
Second after Trae Young
Trae Young :)
"he's incredibly slow to try new things, doesn't even do it just to see if it'll work. Like why wouldn't you try trapping or hedging (even the sixers with doc rivers changed up their coverage of trae young yesterday and they have similar personnel)."
"I can't figure it out. The league has three Sooners. Buddy Heild, Blake Griffin, and Trae Young. Blake was on the floor so..."
"Embiid is going to get targeted on defense.      Trae Young took him to the woodshed.      Imagine Kd, Kyrie and Harden jfc"
"As someone else said... Lillard atleast shows up for the game.  Giannis is being exposed.  And my comments are not about you... don't take them personally.   We are seeing the budding superstars in the league who show up even with a weaker supporting cast - Trae young, Ja Morant."
"Soon, Trae Young will be the biggest villian in the entire Northeast."
almost as bad as danny green on trae young
- Trae Young  6/2/2021
"It's certainly debatable, but I don't think it's Zion ""easily."" I'd take Trae Young, but it's a tough choice."
76ers are a much better team than the Knicks. Not saying Trae Young is bad. Hes still a beast but 76ers are the better team on paper. We will see what happens though.
I’m done with Giannis he was my guy but this is unacceptable the fucking nets have a wall on him he ain’t top 5 player   Trae young out here balling out in the play offs would Giannis have thrived against the knicks I don’t think so   He is the easiest “superstar” to game plan against in nba history the man has no moves no skill how are the nets building a wall I can’t believe it
"don't care still won 🥱  ""Same record"" yet lost 4-1...so weird!!!  Trae Young really took a dump in the garden 😂😂😂😂 it's okay buddy, at least your star player was good in the first round! oh wait....he was trash and got exposed 😂😂😂😂"
Trae Young is our only hope.
"I'm probably higher on SGA than most. Shai put up 25-6-4 with good D and 40% 3 point shooting.    Those numbers are comparable to higher regarded young guards like Fox, Trae and Ja PLUS Shai was playing with worse teammates.    And it's not like SGA is just putting up empty stats on bad teams. He contributed to a playoff Clippers team his rookie year. He was the #2/#3 on the 6th seed OKC team. Presto completely gutted the roster and OKC was still defying expectations before Shai got hurt.    SGA already is putting up all star caliber numbers at 22. He has great size, he's a plus defender, he's a good shooter and he has room to grow.    With a better team around him and more development, I see SGA as an all star/3rd team All NBA guy. Similar to Booker, Mitchell and Beal."
"Lmao, read the headline and came here to say something similar.    Both players are young, but the refs aren’t going to let Simmons body Trae like this especially now since he said it in advance.  What a moron (i love Simmons too, this was just a dumb statement).   He ain’t Scottie Pippen or Tim Duncan lol"
I would rather pick Trae but I think an interesting question would be if Nuggets would rather have Trae Young or Jamal Murray as their PG since they don't need as much playmaking since they have Jokic and might value Murray's defense more.
Trae Young.
I'll take one trae young thank you very much.
"What if the Hawks win the championship this year?  What if the Hawks win 2 out of the next 4?  They are extremely young and extremely good. The team collectively has not reached their prime yet, it’s possible.  Do you still think Luka is “better” if he is putting up triple doubles all over the place but can’t reach the finals while Trae has 2 championships?  Post season success is the ultimate measuring stick.    Purely hypothetical of course but the way that Trae has been in total control of every playoff game he’s been in needs to be considered."
It probably will be if Embiid drops 40 and the Sixers still lose. I don't think Hawks-Nets would be that toxic unless Trae Young starts pissing off Nets fans
"Suns Hawks  Trae vs CP3 and Booker  I know Trae and Booker are young but thats 3 HOFers in their first finals  *HOF by talent for the younger guys, and I think will be there with long careers"
Trae might be too young? Only reason I’d think is he just hasn’t had enough time to achieve enough accolades with the team
I’m not salty at all. I’m getting ready to watch my team in the playoffs. Trae Young sent y’all home right?
"I genuinely think having no crowd for the final stretch of last season and obviously last year's postseason, made, and always makes, a HUGE difference for a lot of players, whom don't like to admit it. Crowd pressure is a legitimate factor, it's a skill to be able to block out the abuse one receives from an Away crowd.   Respect to Trae Young for this lol."
"Most people who are saying Trae on this thread are saying so because he is a ball handler, and an elite passer with scoring gravity. Zion has well above average passing and ball-handling for his position, and the gravity he creates on the inside is only comparable to Giannis and Embiid. Zion is a significantly better scorer already and has better defensive potential than Trae.   I’d take Trae for this season for most teams, and I love his game and he’ll be a more complete offensive player than Zion. But in terms of potential Zion has the potential to be a secondary or primary playmaker and ball-handler while being the best scorer in the game.   This subreddit underrates how much athleticism can matter when used well by a player. Zion has near young Jordan-level hops, coordination, and touch while weighing more than the average center."
&gt; As someone who wants to see Trae Young win a title  Never gonna happen
"Even if Luka doesn't end up to being a potential GOAT like LeBron there's so much young talent in the league the future looks bright. Trae Young, Tatum, Booker, Ayton, Mitchell have already shown they can play elite ball in the playoffs. Then you have Zion who also has potential to be an all time great. Plenty of phenomenal players in their mid 20s too like Jokic, Embiid and Giannis."
So is trae officially going to be the guy we just compare player to now? Is it going to be a player is truly not good until they get there trae young comparisons.
"Trae Young mostly, but also key players getting healthy at just the right time. Hawks along with the Nets were among the most injured teams in the NBA this season. And then they had the coaching change. Long story short, ever since March 1st they became a completely different team, one that had the best record in the NBA during that stretch along with the Jazz."
Trae Young has one as well.
"No dog in this fight - the 1st one is really obviously not a foul.  The 2nd one is a trick that I don't blame Trae Young for pulling because it works, but the ref has to be smart enough to not fall for.  Young clearly gets around Simmons - at that point, he could blow by him, but instead, he slows down and moves sideways so that he'll force contact, and he's clearly ready to shoot the instant he hears a whistling, trying to bait out a cheap and-1."
Zion staying healthy isn’t the same as Trae Young growing 10 inches lol
"Trae young, Zion's hypothetical position is already filled"
"Injury is literally the biggest concern about Zion.  That's like saying if Trae Young was 7 feet tall and defended like Kawhi, only then would I pick him."
"Nate was never a bad coach by any means. In fact, I don't think any Pacers fan wish him ill-will. He did a ton for getting our rosters into the playoffs which is exactly what the Pacers FO wanted in the first place.  Atlanta's roster is much better constructed than the Pacers and the combination of Trae Young (an actual star, something the Pacers haven't had) and Clint Capela is the perfect duo for the style of basketball that Nate wants to run.  That being said, you still need to acknowledge that in a decade and a half of being a head coach Nate has only won two playoff series and the most recent win was against an overperforming Knicks team without a true star.   But still, gotta give Nate credit for taking us to the playoffs. I was saying all last season that our ceiling was a 3rd seed and there's still part of me that believes that we have enough collective talent to get to the second round (similar to a manner that the Hawks did this playoff run). But, we ended up looking a lot like the same Orlando team that decided to blow it up finally.  I have no idea what to do with our team moving forward. Firing Nate can be the right decision just as much as hiring Bjork was the wrong one. Part of me wonders what we'd look like if we had gone with Chris Finch instead."
Trae Young is better right now. But I can see a world where Zion's physical tools push him ahead if he can shore up weaknesses or even turn them into strengths (defense).
"Didn't see the shove Simmons had on Heurter mid-air as he received the pass from Trae Young live, that should've been a foul there really. Obviously it somehow worked out better for the Hawks that way but the refs were really swallowing their whistles late."
Trae young. Court vision + elite passing is incredibly valuable and often can’t be taught. Zion is still fantastic though
"Hmm. I could see that happening.  I think it's slightly more likely that Trae Young ends up with the series being a coming out party for him, like last year's playoffs were for Luka."
&gt;PG - Trae Young   &gt;   &gt;SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   &gt;   &gt;SF - Luka Doncic   &gt;   &gt;PF - Michael Porter Jr.   &gt;   &gt;C - Deandre Ayton  IDK I still think Brooklyn is scoring 199 pts on that team 4 out of 7 times.
Trae Young: “B-Baka! You think you can butter me up with that praise??”
I attribute it to hawks excellent offense and the fact Doc Rivers put together a terrible gameplan that asked a guy who couldn't stay in front of Trae Young to guard him.   Trae Young shot quality (expected eFG%) by quarter  Q1 52%  Q2 50%  Q3 47%  Q4 48%  they were playing a dumb defensive scheme and then stopped dropping. so we didnt have to help off the corners.
"They knew what they were doing   Of course Simmons wants to play physical with Trae young, one of them can actually play basketball. Before any sixers fan replies to me don’t make me post the video of him bricking 4 straight layups then 2 straight free throws"
"Butler stonks are down, as are LeBron's, after reaching all time high last Finals.  Trae Young made an unexpected rally and is a hot commodity again after being hated nearly a whole season.  Tyler Herro did essentially the opposite. After a great launch, he is on a strong downtrend.  Luka stonks remain high, but he has yet to experience an /r/NBA bear market in popularity. I'd be wary praising Luka next season he might soon be the bad guy.  As usual sell Pat Bev and buy D Rose."
Translation: I'm going to beat the shit out of Trae Young and hope the refs don't call it.
way better talent  and a great player in trae young
"Trae was in a similar camp with Atlanta, where he was so good that the front office accelerated the rebuild this season. Luckily (unluckily?) for Trae, his second year the team around him was so intentionally dogshit, and his best teammate in JC was suspended for nearly half the season, that he was able to showcase his elite abilities while putting up “empty stats” that showed us the future promise. This season our GM got aggressive in a free agency class with few teams as completion, and he was surrounded by veteran talent, and developing young pieces, all in one off season. Helped along by assets collected while the GM was in tank mode Trae year’s one and two.I"
Trae young is a god

I predicted that Trae Young would be a bust. I'm applying to new job postings at my local circus for the senior executive clown position

Everyone in the northeast will hate Trae Young after this one lmao
Watching Trae Young destroy New York and Philly fans has brought me so much joy
Are we going to get a video of Sixers fans screeching about Trae Young being their dad's dick?
"Say what you want about Trae Young, the Hawks will not be denied."
"if we can't win, i'll happily take finals mvp trae young as a consolation prize"
I love Trae Young
Is Trae Young better than Embiid?
Idk if anybody is dumb enough outside of Philly to think Simmons is better than Trae Young but if you do exist stop watching basketball because Trae is a top 16 player at worst and an absolute stud despite being the worst defensive point guard in the league.
Does Trae Young ever have to pay for a beer in Boston if they win this series
Trae Young about to be the most hated man in New York and Philadelphia
Trae young gotta be banned from the north east by tomorrow right?
Trae Young is my dad. Go dad!!

trae young has embiid calling him daddy
"This cheap foul nonsense that Trae Young pulls is unwatchable. He’s not the only one who does it, and it doesn’t excuse the Sixers for this meltdown, but the NBA’s gotta clean up those plays."
"Ben Simmons can’t hit a free throw, Lou Williams good, Trae young good, sixers bad apparently"
"6ers up 26 and are now down 1. Lou Will led the come back from the bench and Trae Young just took over the last 4 possessions. Embiid's injury is def getting worse, he's bleeding through his compressions. Hack a Ben is actually a real strat lmfao"
"The amount of satisfaction I have from watching Trae Young evolve over the past 3 years, everyone slandered his ass calling him a bust with that Luka trade.  Trae always showed flashes of this shit in his 1st and even more in his 2nd year, just no one paid attention"
Trae young is the most talented players in the league pound for pound  . I would rather start a franchise with him than Luka
that trae young chit was OD annoying when he was doing it to the knicks but ngl it’s funny af when it happens to anyone else 🤣🤣🤣
Lol don’t allow the game to be close in the last few min with a dude like Trae Young on the other side. Dude is a certified stone cold killer.
I heard Trae Young was too small for post-season tho...

Trae Young really is a killer. Dude is made for the playoffs
Absolute brilliance by Trae Young.
Trae Young evolving into James Harden
so trae young or luka?
Trae Young is going to need a security escort until he leaves Philly.
That's the most Trae Young foul ever rofl
fuck trae young pussy ass mf
TRAE YOUNG FOUL BAITING LMFAO!
Trae is so young and plays like a 10 year vet
trae young more clutch then the entire philly team. hawks are for real
Holy shit do I love Trae Young?
Trae Young &gt;&gt;
Lmao! Trae Young is a KILLA!
Holy shit Trae Young
I really wish I didn’t read that whole thing about that cat in the middle of the Hawks coming back. Trae Young is a monster.
trae young is it man
Trae Young making a mid range 2??? Am I hallucinating?
trae young is my babe
"Trae ""short"" Young cant finish"
wtf he has 14 FTA??? Where's those dudes complaining about how Trae Young has more than the entire Sixers team...
"Way to get in Simmons' head, Trae Young. Lol"
This is where Trae Young can become a bonafide super star.
why would trae young shoot that
Fucking Trae young is dirty.
Do you understand how big Embiid is? This man collided in the air with Trae young... and lost the matchup? IM SICK OF ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
When Trae Young gets Trae Young'd
Trae Young falls for the Trae Young move
I wouldn't say Trae Young is cold tonight
"Agreed. Trae Young, Harden, and Lowry are all plenty talented, but the rules make it so players can abuse this loophole and it just isn't fun to watch for any basketball fans"
I was told Trae Young was a defensive liability
"Losing sucks. But hopefully this run can lure a star to come team up with Trae Young. At the very least, being fully healthy next year in the playoffs with DeAndre Hunter and Cam reddish would be nice to see."
hawks fans can’t actually tell me they enjoy watching trae young. it’s effective but god damn it’s so annoying to watch as an actual product. just took the most annoying parts of hardens game honestly
Trae Young giving no effort on D is the biggest culprit these last couple of minutes for why the Hawks are just allowing so many easy shots
Seth Curry outscoring Trae Young wtf
trae young would like to talk
When Curry's pump fake got Bogi off his feet... is there even a 1% chance someone like Trae Young would reset and shoot like Curry did? Or is it 100% a lean-in for FTs?
The new rules specifically target foul baiting though. I just don't get why people are acting like Trae Young will be the only one affected when half the All-NBA players are notorious for shooting at awkward angles to draw bullshit fouls.
"Have people forgotten how dominant steph is, already? Just the fact he carried the current Warriors team to an almost 7th seed is proof enough he still has it.  Trae is young, so it's impressive how good he is."
"After the bucks lose this series, is Giannis going to say Trae young is the best in the world?"
"If you’re not interested in watching Trae Young and the Hawks, you’re not interested in basketball."
Yeah powell offense is spoonfed by luka and capella is spoonfed by trae. Trae clearly does it better. Also to your second point ok kp camp in the three point line. So do Collins sometimes. I see trae young make a pass to collins for three way more than luka to kp.
"How does this imply Trae is a better passer? What if his teammates are simply more likely to make the shot?  Even on threes i think trae assists are more valuable. A lot of luka's assists are i pass to you and you make a play. While for trae young most of the time he passes after making a play. If you look at these assists generally trae create more open, better shots for his team.  Trae has two of the biggest lob threats in the NBA.   You can't convince me that kp or dwight powell can't finish on these trae young passes, most of them or uncontested layups or dunks.  Also why are passes to the interior inherently a better indicator of passing ability?  It's way easier to create an open 3 than an uncontested lay up or dunk in the nba. How is this not obvious."
"Trae Young, sheesh, pulled one out of his bag. That shimmy 3 was art. I still think the Bucks will be able to get past them but massive ups to the Hawks for getting here and playing their hearts out. As impressive as the Heat last year I would say.  PS: I'm a Masters student and I watch a lot of sports, so for my dissertation I am trying to test a behavioural science concept using sports prediction data. Please spend a minute and put your Conference Finals predictions here:   [https://forms.gle/cNAFSS3GEzHPWrHn7](https://forms.gle/cNAFSS3GEzHPWrHn7)"
&gt;Also luka make way more passes. This season trae averaged 57.4 passes per game and luka averaged 64.1 passes per game. So for trae young the passes are lot more likely to transfer to assists.  How does this imply Trae is a better passer? What if his teammates are simply more likely to make the shot?   &gt;Lastly this is the most important point. Through just simple eye test trae young make a lot more passes to the interior than luka doncic.  Trae has two of the biggest lob threats in the NBA. Also why are passes to the interior inherently a better indicator of passing ability?   I'm not sure who is a better passer but some of your arguments are hard to follow.
This has Carmelouken but with Trae Young instead written all over it
I like this Trae Young kid.
"&gt; when we gonna talk about Trae Young being better than Luka?  He's not but OK lol.  Put ATL in the west and 0 support with Trae, they lose first round also.    Luka is playing with a 7'3'' guy who can't get a fucking rebound to save his life."
"Basically, 2021 Hawks are the 2020 Heat, with Trae Young taking Jimmy Butler's place"
Yeah trae young types are usually the ones everyone hates cause they usually just chuck
But there’s no fun players in this playoffs. What? Devin Booker? Trae Young? CP3? Giannis? Kevin Huerter? Never heard of them
"Wait real talk, did you care the Trae Young year or not really either?"
"""Wild overreaction"". What are you even talking about? What are basing that on? Trae has already proven himself as more accomplished and complete as a player than Luka has. The onus is 100% on you to prove why Luka would do even close to as well as Young.   As for Ayton, of course Ayton is a better fit than Luka."
"48 points from Trae!!! This Young man (sorry 😂) is going to be GREAT in few years. He’s performing amazing in his first playoffs where the level of pressure is humongous and he’s delivering so many incredible games. Atlanta, nobody lost in the Doncic - Trae operation. So fun to see him playing with these teammates around. Atlanta - Phoenix would be a great finale"
Depends how hawks play tbf. If its a back and forth series with Trae going off. I think people will give it more respect.   But dunno about the clippers tbh. Regardless i think people will just automatically say but they needed Kawhi and PG just to beat trae young etc cause ppl hate clips
There wouldn’t be a Trae Young without Curry. Trae is his son
"2021 - Injury ring part 2, Booker never the same after head butt by Pat Beverly, CP3 forced quarantine for 4 weeks by Adam Silver. Suns lose to the Clippers. Finals, Pat Bev accidentally head butts and eye poke Trae Young, making the Clippers win their first Finals."
This sub needs to apologise to trae young like bill Simmons just did.
"I can't speak for all of them, but here's my perspective: if Luka and Trae were never traded for each other and no one ever compared them to each other.... well that's not realistic if they're still in the same draft. If everyone just accepted that Luka was better and didn't clown on the Hawks over it, I'd be very active arguing on the internet that Trae is better.   Let me give you an example from another sport: Ronald Acuña and Juan Soto are 2 of the best young players in baseball, they play in the same division and came #1 and #2 in the ROY race in 2018 (exactly like Luka and Trae). Acuña is on my team, the Atlanta Braves, and even though my guy won ROY and had a higher MVP vote finish in 2019, in 2020 Soto was incredible and put up hitting stats no one had seen in a generation. Everyone in the media and r/baseball crowned Soto as the best young player in baseball. Now I love watching Juan Soto and really admire his game, but anytime I saw people putting him ahead of Acuña I would bring up stats arguing for my guy as the better player. Because it's not toxic, it's just casual sports discussion.   The Luka/Trae debate has become so toxic, so repetitive, so reactionary, so done to death, that I literally never want to see them mentioned in the same sentence ever again. Under different circumstances I could've welcomed the debate and comparisons, but it's gone way too far and I have absolutely no appetite for it even when I could take this opportunity to gloat over Trae's success. Just please let it die already."
Bucks tend to go away from anything that works for them. Jrue and giannis pick n roll was unstoppable but let's just have pat caughnington shoot the brick when he's 0/9. I just can't believe the stupidity of bud. He made Trae young and Kevin Durant look like Michael Jordan out there in those series. If bucks somehow make it to the finals he's going to make Devin booker look like he's surpassed kobe bryant
Philly chanted “fuck Trae young” just as New York did and Philly fans in general are known for being insufferable I don’t think he’s trying to be the villain at all.  It’s just him being him and that’s what’s so great about it
There’s a very real possibility that Trae Young is pulling an Allen Iverson 2.0 before our very eyes and we won’t fully appreciate it till 5-10 years from now
"lemme just say curry too 15 all time and an obvious hall of famed while Trae is for sure young and hasn’t accomplished nearly as much. That being said...Trae dropped damn near a 50 point double double in the conference finals with one of the best defensive oriented rosters in the league. He won the game, on the road. In his third year in the league. Bro if you don’t put some respect on his name Idk how you can’t say you’re a hater, be honest. Watch the game and tell me he isn’t the most dominant player on the floor in that game. What do we want from players if not this? Showing up when the lights are brightest is everything fans revere in a player. Compare him to whoever you want because he’s doing shit that even curry didn’t do at that age. trae is the heir apparent as best point guard in the nba, not saying he’s there yet but in 2 years he could be."
"Trae Young is an elite playmaker. He was hovering around 10 APG next to g-league talent and rookies last season. Now he's getting his team so many good looks in the ECF, he generates so many points outside of his scoring. I think people really underrate this ability and view him as just a shooter or scorer. No, he's a complete point guard in a way a guy like Kyrie just isn't."
Amen. I see you are preaching the good word of Trae the Young. It is a noble way of living.
Trae Young stupid boiiii
"Bah God, is that trae young music?"
I simply don’t want you guys to win because that would give possibly the worst coach in the playoffs given the talent of the roster a championship   Like how do you let trae young of all people drop nearly 50 on you when you have that many good defenders
Yeh the two team stars were going at each other head to head first trae young nails a 3 then pat...conaughton???
"Hawks gotta go ahead and trademark the moniker “The Villain” Trae Young, I need t-shirts stat!!!!"
"He was in a solid position, just didn't see the play coming. I think you're underselling the brilliance of Trae Young here."
FATE OF THE UNIVERSE ON THE LINE. MARTIANS GOT THAT DEATH LASER AIMED ON EARTH. WE NEED A FREE THROW TO LIVE. TRAE YOUNG OR BEN SIMMONS. I WANT SIMMONS.
I think trae young v devin booker less cp3 in the finals is interesting to watch
I honestly don't know if I love Trae Young or hate him
He’s watching Ayton and Trae Young wondering how’s he’s going to get there and become relevant again.
Kyrie Irving on the Clevelans Cavaliers  won a championship as a point guard. He made it to the Conference Finals and then beat the Warriors for a chip. How is Trae Young the first black point guard to win a game in the conference finals?
Trae Young is good at basketball.
"I mean this dude is on one,  even implying Trae Young is a “good” defender? Lmao.   Obvious troll"
Give some respect to future HOF Trae Young
"Lmao imagine being this soft, I’m sure you’re a trae young and harden fan too right? Contact = foul…no exceptions"
"Trae Young, so hot right now"
&gt;  I find Trae young incredibly boring to watch  Bro this is deadass the worst take ive seen on this sub especially saying it after the performance he had tonight
"No no no it was far easier to double against the Nets than it would be the Hawks. The Nets usually have 2 maybe 3 knockdown shooters on the court and that's including KD. If you sag off Bruce Brown he can't really punish you that hard, but if you take a guy off John Collins or Bogdan, they're gonna punish you from the midrange or three all night long. Trae Young would happily pass it off to one of those two, whereas for the Nets a heavily contested KD midrange is probably still one of their better options.  Also the reason that the Bucks defense started to collapse at the end was because they had to go small. Can't do anything about that Trae and Collins were clubbing them all night. If anything they changed it up a bit too late."
"After watching Trae Young from round 1 of the playoffs,  I'm officially a fan. This man is a legend in the making.  Win or lose, he's making history."
Imagine thinking Trae young isn't a top 15 player right now lol  You honest to God believe Brad Beal is a better player than Trae Young?
Trae young posts are making my like finger tired.
Idk why this is getting downvoted. It’s not arguable that booker can get a good shot way easier than trae young. And young shot 34% from three on 6 attempts a game. That’s closer to Westbrook’s 3 point percentage this season than it is to league average lmao
Every team lost every trade if they weren't trading for Trae Young
"They get along great.  Trae isn’t a perfect player and did some dumb things repeatedly in his first couple of year in the NBA, things that he has mostly moved past now.   JC called him out in the film room and held him accountable.  They’re great friends, it wasn’t a toxic encounter.  I honestly think they both grew from it.  It’s the same thing that happens on most competitive teams, the hawks are just young and leak stories sometimes."
"(2018) Damian Lillard in 4 games against Jrue Holiday: 74 points, 19 assists, 25/71 shooting (swept 🧹🧹😹)  (2021) Trae Young in 1 game against Jrue Holiday: 48 points, 11 assists, 17/34 shooting (won)  🧐"
So Trae Young and Devin Booker are the best players in the world now?
maybe they were trying to avoid being forced to switch a big onto Trae Young… maybe?? idk it’s hard to put logic behind most of Mike Budenholzer’s decisions
Trae young! More like Trae old cause he's playing like a grizzly vet outchea
[Jay Williams] Congratulations to Trae Young for becoming the first black point guard in NBA history to win a game in the conference finals!
"Tough one. I’m very high on Trae’s playmaking, i think he’s at least top 5 in the league with the potential to become the best playmaker soon. Both are great scorers, but even tho Book is not a great defender, he’s not as bad as Young.  I’ll go Trae because I value highly the ability to run an offense at a high level and involving teammates. Also, point guard is probably the best position to be a defensive liability. But I won’t argue with anyone who says Booker because he’s pretty damn good as well."
Trae Young is the true god. (Black)
Trae young is actually already better than steph curry
Easy. By hating them anyways and winning this series. A Hawks-Suns series is much more interesting than bucks-suns/clippers. Be like Trae Young and revel in the crowds' boos
Yes Trae Young is a very impressive 5th pick in a draft.
Well I'm not Trae Young
gimme beverley over trae young because defense  lul
"Yea I would too, outside of the JC/Millsap matchup this roster is categorically better I'd say. I don't think prime Horford matches up against Capela all that well and while Kyle Korver was a badass Trae Young and the combo of Bogi/Hunter/Huerter provide insane depth compared to the 2015 roster. Young in particular would slaughter them; IT almost did it to them in the 1st round that year and prime IT isn't close to Young's playmaking level"
"Trae Young is legit, people really made it seem like the Luka-Trae trade was extremely lopsided or something but imo it was fairly close and the Hawks also did a great job at surrounding Trae with great players that fit"
Get your Trae Young Rookie cards while you still can (for cheap)
Trae 'Hans Gruber' Young I like it
Ok Trae Young is a monster and a killer.
"That was in his 4th season, age 22 season same as Trae right now. Same run he dragged that Cavs to the finals.  Age 21 he had 8 games of 30+ pts in 13 playoff games.   Only way a person can say he didn't have this killer instinct back then was if that dude didn't actually watch young LeBron."
Trae Young has 20 wins and Luka is in the playoffs🤬🤬  Oh wait that doesn’t apply now that Trae has the better team
"Trae Young has done it to 3 top defenses already and not just against 1 dude either, when will he get his due?"
"Sorry but I judge all players in their current form. Not off legacy or past accomplishments. Especially when measuring overall skill.. Yeah, Trae doesn’t have the same overall accomplishments as others but that’s not what we’re talking about. We’re discussing overall best players in the league at this exact moment.   You still can’t assemble a list of 10 players who are currently better than Trae Young."
Trae Young feels like he's been the league for years with this level of play.
"I lol’d. “Intensify”?!? Tha fuck. He said if he WINS A CHAMPIONSHIP. Without an all star cast. If Trae Young WINS A CHAMPIONSHIP he is better than Luka Doncic idgaf how many triple doubles and Hollywood smiles into the camera Luka does. And better then dame Lillard, and James harden,  whole rack of players. With new information comes new decision making. We would all have to adjust.   Ans it’s not even like the stats arent there either. Trae has been putting up 28 and 10 we all assumed it was ‘empty stats’ well again we would need to adjust. He’d pass a ton of guys. He would have beat a fully healthy Embiid and Giannis (!!), and probably Booker. The only players I’d feel comfortable saying are better would be KD, Bron, Steph."
Okay. Entertainment wise I don’t enjoy watching Trae. As simple as that I don’t like watching him play. It’s not an argument it’s a fact. I find Trae young incredibly boring to watch. He has highlight plays sure but in general his game is the kind of game I hate playing against when I ball and I hate watching
Simmons holds Trae to 37% shooting in the entire series bar the first half of game 1 when Trae dropped 25 on Danny Green. With no Simmons on him this game he goes for 48. At some point we have to acknowledge Simmons did a great defensive job on Young despite his own offensive shortcomings.
Good luck getting a MLK Trae young jersey
Gringotts is always open for Trae Young.
[Trae Young to Connaughton](https://youtu.be/zXvwq-cxGZw&amp;t=2m)
I vote Trae Young for 1st Team All Defense.
"Tell you what guys, and don't flame me but I think this Trae Young fella might be actually good at basketball."
"As a long time Hawks fan, I could’ve told you letting Jeffrey Demarco Teague guard Rayford Trae Young was a horrible idea. What baffles me is why Bud ever thought it was okay"
Trae Young is ready for the moment.
Hawks have a ton of fire power. Trae young also a monster at PnR
24 point lead in 4th quarter of Game 7. A rip in the time space continuum opens up and swallows Trae Young. Scott Foster says play on. Suns/Clips go on a 28-3 run to close it out.
One of the hot takers said that trae young is just plain the biggest dog anytime he takes the court and I honest to god think it’s the truth. Just a different type of dude.
mavericks got fleeced on the trae young trade lmao. Luka is just a glorified stat padder
"Obviously I'm a huge Trae Young fan and a believer in his talent and work ethic, and I can only speak for myself but I'd be surprised if a lot of Hawks fans didn't agree with me.... I knew he'd be good in the playoffs but I didn't think he'd be *this* good *this* fast, that's just not how it usually goes. But these new cats are built different I guess."
Welcome to the Trae Young era
Elite rim protector Trae Young stopped a point blank Simmons dunk bro
Oh Johnny Collins is about to get the Max.   Trae is about to the Max.   Huerter is going to get PAAIIIDDD!   I think Red Velvet will get a huge contract. The resslers need to keep this core together for one more year.   But I do think both John Collins and Trae young will get Max
"Trae ""Clamps"" Young"
"Yea I don’t think it’s ridiculous to say at this point, but my thinking is a little more like this.   The two of them could have played exactly the same as they did, but say their teammates make one or two less shots in a critical game or the opponent makes one or two more. Say in game 7 against the sixers where Trae shot horrendously, Kevin huerter has a performance like he did in game 3 (I think that’s the one, where he shot 0-8) and they lose by double digits. Porzingis or THJ shoot a little better and the mavs beat the Clippers. The popular narrative would be so so different without Luka or Trae playing any different at all.   I personally was getting tired of all the Luka love especially on this sub so I’m happy to see Trae so well. But at the same time what Luka did in the Clippers series looked like him making his case for legitimately top 2-3 in the league, and I see Luka winning an mvp and I can’t envison the same for Trae. But yeah, we’ll see, the league is blessed with so much young talent right now."
"After Bruno Mars, Trae Young is giving hope to all the small dudes of the world."
"Though I’m not a huge fan of either (sports make you have weird feelings), Trae Young and Fernando Tatis are absolutely changing the game. Its impossible to deny the raw talent they possess, but it’s stunning to see the charisma and demeanor out of such young guys. Just wild to watch things evolve."
"Eh for one game or one series: CP3, Curry, Dame Time, Harden (yeah SG, but basically played point this year),  To start a team and picking a PG for the future, Trae Young might be #1, Ball might be a consideration need to see another season from him (better defensive upside).  He's up there though, I am probably forgetting a couple others but top 10 to me overall."
"I’ll allow it, I love Trae Young. but in my totally and completely unbiased opinion I think Book is better."
"We aren't calling half the league superstars  We're calling Trae Young a superstar.  He isn't half the league, he's 1 guy."
When you can't post up Trae Young and still have to shove him to throw up a brick. Yikes
Trae Young flops too lmao.
Bro how the fuck do you CHOOSE to go under the screen against Trae Young… twice…
"Gotchya. I get it Dame is good.  I have a cold take where my heart just loves Jimmy.  Maybe this idea is coming from how many PGs are god tier right now. Steph, Chris Paul, Cliff Paul, Trae and Luke showing some young talent.  So much PG talent that I feel Dame is not at the front of my mind."
"That Trae Young is better than Steph, Kyrie and Dame. Yea he's on that tier of Tatum, Zion, Booker but just hold on a little bit before putting him above NBA champions and superstar vets."
"Caruso- 27 yo- not old.  Schroder- 27 yo- not old.   Ad- 28 yo- not old.  Horton tucker - 20 yo- not old.  Kuzma - 25 yo- not old.  Kcp - 28 yo- not old.  Wesley matthews- 34 yo- old.  Marc gasol- 36 yo- old.   Drummond - 27 yo- not old.   Lebron- 36- old.   Ben mclemore- 28 yo - not old.   Trez- 27 yo- not old.  Markieff morris- 31 yo- just in between.   So in conclusion out of 13 players in the rotation only 3 are old. and other than lebron theres only Mathews and gasol who are old and both were healthy and didnt play big minutes.    So yes, again-everything you said was untrue- their age had no part in what happened.   Did giannis age played a role when he got injured? Murray? even donovan and trae are getting mild injuries. And they both are young players."
Yeah F trae young /s
"Trae young stood on a refs foot. Thats not what im talking about. Its the players with a long history of being injury prone that i was really interested in.  Like the people who use AD, embiid or kawhi's injury, as if they dont have a long history of these types of injuries.   Trae, kyrie, lebron all were contact injuries the others were non contact"
"6 all stars was the previous NBA record. Not some regular occurrence lmao. And yes a 65% increase over the previous NBA record for the most all stars to miss a game during the playoffs is indeed ""crazy.""  Especially because that 10 doesn't even include star players like Trae Young or Jamal Murray who hardly missed the all star game; or stars like LeBron that were noticeably slowed down by injuries but didnt miss any games."
Suns probably but they’ll be overtaken by the Giannis-less bucks or the Trae Hawks  Was thinking maybe the 2007 Cavs but I feel like I’d take young Lebron over these guys
Trae young has to be in my top 17 players
"Injuries are one of the main topics of discussion this post-season.  Like it or not.  I mean damn, injuries were already bad enough in the second round.  And now you got Trae Young and Giannis sitting out with the series at 2-2.  It's just crazy."
I want him to win. But also like Trae Young. I would like to see Trae Young at least make the Finals.
where would you rank trae young
"Anyway this finals go I will be so fucking happy for who wins and de aster by whoever loses.   Giannis is an amazing guy who plays as a beast and deserve the win just from his accomplishments until now.  CP3, even though he flops a lot, is a beast on the court and deserves a ring because I don't see him getting another shot at it and with everything he did in his career to fall short would be awful, also Ayton and Book are great. Also Suns needs the first ring.   Trae Young deserves it for his hustle, taking the hawks this far and how disrespected he was until now, but he is the one who will probably have the most chances.  Paul George deserved though, but fuck Pat Beverly, so I am sorry Playoff P."
I thought shaq played with Trae Young
"Yes, we know how it feels. Trae is young and will bounce back, hopefully."
"When Lou Will first came in the league he was super young and was on the sixers.  He started out very green and averaged what 12 ppg? That was his 3rd year.  He came out his first year with getting 12 points on 25 minutes.  Not amazing, but not terrible.  But the big point is his 3pt shooting he averaged .237 in the playoffs at Philly.  He’s young inexperienced.  In Toronto he didn’t have the best opportunity to fit in and with the Clippers he shot .261 about as bad as when he first came into the league,  But with Atlanta he’s averaging .415 (for both years) and .480 this year.  He’s taking fewer shots but making them at a higher percentage indicative of him being more focused and choosing his shots more methodically.  Which didn’t happen on the Clippers.  His FT % is better  His overall efficiency is up with the Hawks and with Doc he had the opportunity to play a meaningful role but Doc didn’t put him in positions to be successful.  That’s part of coaching.  I expect Lou Will to have one of the most efficient and best playoff performances for his skill set to date this year because of how Nate McMillan is utilizing him.  He’s in when he needs to be, when Trae is out he does his thing he’s not forced into being a savior trying to jack up 3s like Doc forced him to be he’s efficiently contributing   Doc in my opinion makes people worse while being their best friend.    Ben Simmons 1st year in the playoffs in Philly .700 averaging 4 of 6 at the line.  Under Doc? 2 of 6.  He’s a master of making people lose confidence.  But to bring it back here’s Lou Will and Matt Barnes talking about Doc.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lTihIdNKAmA  Doc isn’t somebody who builds you up, he tears you down even when you are doing through a hard time and Lou and others could have really benefitted being with the Clippers if somebody else was coaching.  Fuck Ty Lue almost got us to the finals WITHOUT Kawhi... without Kawhi.  I’m so happy for Lou to be on Atlanta with a great team and coach.  I’m rooting for him.  Doc I do not root for I just sort of am the messenger of warning about him and feel bad for the sixers"
I mean a knicks fan spat on Trae Young during the course of a game just two rounds ago so yes NBA fans take it too extreme sometimes
"I'll be surprised if Giannis plays again this season. That said, the Bucks are just too inconsistent.  Even with a healthy Giannis &amp; Atlanta missing Trae Young, the Hawks were controlling the game &amp; probably would have won whether Giannis returned to the game or not last night.  I hope I'm wrong but I think Atlanta wins easily Thursday night (especially since Giannis is more than likely out) &amp; finishes things off 2 days later in Atlanta.  Regardless, the Suns have too much talent &amp; are very well coached &amp; the Championship is basically theirs to lose."
"If everyone stay health Suns have a high chance of winning. Hawks without Trae Young against this Suns team will be tough on them, because Suns have the wings to guard Hawks perimeter player. It would be an interesting series in theory."
"I was hoping for Suns-Bucks with Giannis healthy  But considering Giannis isn’t going to play, then Suns-Hawks I guess. Rather see two young teams go at it and at least Trae will play.   You got the whole Point God, old school PG in CP3 vs the young, modern day PG in Trae"
He’s not the only one. That’s why I said in part. He was just the latest to utilize and popularize it and usually made it look ugly which didn’t help. Luka does that shit too and Harden had made it almost an art form. People still be calling it the “Trae Young Rule” though.
" Man between him, Reddish, Hunter, K’Von, Collins, and Trae, the Hawks have such a great young core  And then you add vets like Bogi, Gallo, Lou Will, Capela, Solomon Hill.  They’re literally 15 deep in quality"
trae young soon
"I get the whole ""Trae Young is underappreciated"" thing, but the dude is **literally** younger than I was when I was 23.  He'll get his turn."
"Height alone makes the average NBA player a genetic monstrosity, let alone their athletic skill. If you are over 6ft, you are in the top 90% of height. If you are over 6'5"" you're in the 99%. The average NBA height is like... 6'7""? And most teams have a guy who is 6'10""-7ft+.   Like, I'm a relatively tall person (6'2""). I can't really imagine trying to compete with a guy 5 or 6 inches taller than me in a game like basketball. (PS this makes guys like Trae Young all the more impressive)."
"Ok calm down there, there is also Tatum- Brown, Zion- Ingram, Trae- Collins. I wouldn’t say he is the best young duo when Tatum-Brown and Zion-Ingram duo are both all stars"
"How is this worse from Trae Young, Harden, KD or any of the manipulative call-baiting antics the top players use nowadays? It’s only annoying if it ain’t your guy. I’m not saying I agree or like it, but it’s savvy veteran shit and it works. Blame the league."
"trae young has had a small sample size as he's only been a cheerleader for a game. therefore, the MVC (most valuable cheerleader) goes to kaminsky who's been averaging beastly averages of 64.9 claps per game and 37.6 high-fives per game.   ""honorable mentions go to thanasis antetokoumpo and jared dudley who came in 2nd and 3rd in voting respectively, sources tell ESPN"""
Feel bad for Trae young and Giannis. If they make the finals one of them are getting hurt again
"They also had young high upside talent in place at literally every single position already too. Trae, Cam/Huerter, Hunter, Collins, Okongwu. They didn't try to go all in before the young core talent was already there."
"Chris Paul, Giannis, or Trae Young is going to be the finals MVP. Who would have guessed?"
"Chris Paul falling down a bunch vs Trae young, who will also be falling down a bunch, in the the nba finals is gonna be a new level of unwatchable"
No Anthony Davis No Jamal Murray No Kawhi Leonard and No Giannis or Trae Young Suns ring should come with a pair of crutches
"Embracing the villain role today:  Chris ""Trae Young"" Paul"
"Congratulations Chris paul and the Phoenix Suns for your first NBA champhionship.    Just book it, hurt Giannis and hobbled minus defender in trae young. CP3 had it rough and now will finally earn his deserved ring"
Suns ain’t won yet. Calm down lmao. They still got trae young to get through
All this to lose to Trae young smh.
Lmao wow a Trae Young fan complaining about calls!
Still salty that Trae Young ended the process I see.
"Honestly, I'm less annoyed by flopping than I am the Trae Young/James Harden shit."
I guess we are going to see a cp3 trae young flop off in the finals
"I’m glad CP3 is getting his chance along with the very talented and deserving Suns, but this playoff series has been a heartbreaker for me. CP3 is one of my all time favorites, but I want Paul George to finally get the shine he deserves. And Giannis…man, I just love Giannis. Would be happy if any of these guys get a ring.  Shoutout to Trae Young, but he’s young. He’s got time. There’s more on the line for CP3, PG, and Giannis."
"Lmao the fact that Mark Jackson even has to say “CP may get in your nerves with the selling antics…” before saying he’s a HoF player is ridiculous.  I don’t always agree with Van Gundy, but I’d have given double T’s to CP and Boogie earlier and set the standard that way.  But when they don’t do that and reward this type of shit, well, that’s how you get Trae Young. And he’s entertaining. But he’s the first of many. We’re about to have a league full of foul fisherman and it will be unwatchable."
Pretty clear Trae Young should've been an all star over Ben this year
If you don't see the difference in the types of flops/tricks... I can't help you lol  Guys like CP3 and Kyle Lowry  exaggerate on opponent's genuine mistakes. They're opportunistic about it.  Trae Young aggressively goes out there and gets bogus calls like getting 3 FTs jumping into guys or stopping on a dime so you can run him over.
Will be a matchup for the ages of flops when Paul is guarding Trae Young and vice versa
"Chris Paul flops: oh what a smart play. That's why he's a great leader  Trae Young flops: he's not an all star he just flops for calls, can't lead a team"
Ironic from a dude whose team star is Trae Young.
A Trae Young-Devin Booker matchup in the Finals is the last thing bill simmons wants to see lmao
I really want Trae Young to complete the Space Jam trilogy.
"In the words of Trae Young, it’s getting real quiet in here"
Trae Young is definitely roided up
Depends. Is Trae Young guarding the rim?
"Kyrie Irving was worse as a number one scoring option than every single one of those guys has already been in their young careers.   I genuinely don’t see how kyrie is better than trae. Trae is a drastically better playmaker, comparable scorer, and already proven better leader than kyrie. Add in that trae is generally a healthier player than kyrie and I’m not buying that kyrie is above him for any other reason than he’s been in the league longer.   No one would take kyrie over Luka and I think trae is closer to Luka than kyrie is to trae."
"Did they say that about Trae Young?  I can't say I've been insanely knowledgable about the top prospects in the last few drafts since Rockets never really had 1st rounders then, but I do remember there were lots of question marks (can't remember if they were truly with merit) and other red flags on Trae Young."
Trae young too
To add to this they pretty much nailed that Trae Young and Luka would be the easy top 2 from their draft class.  They were lukewarm on Ayton but I think they love rim protectors and switch defenders at the big position more than all around solid defenders like Ayton.  Plus they said he shot too many mid range jumpers for their liking.  To be fair they were right about him till this year.  For the most part Duncan and Leroux for people who don't watch college but only evaluate talent based on footage they watch after the season are really great on prospects.  The obvious mistakes are super athlete guards they fall in love with like Dennis Smith.
My personal ranking: 1. Tatum 2. Mitchell 3. Kyrie 4. Trae  5. Booker  Ive been super impressed by the young guys development this year
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
Kinda hard to not like Trae Young.
"How did 2019 raptors have more luck than this year? I want suns to win but  Round 1) crippled AD. round 2) no Jamal, Barton. round 3) no Kawhi  The finals wouldve been the first healthy series (apart from hawks bucks) and now Giannis/trae will probably miss multiple games if they make it.  It reminds me of the 1999 shortened season. I remember a bill Simmons pod on it 3 years ago. He said going into that year the heat were a big favourite. But coming out of it all the youngest teams were on top and got injured the least (won by a ~22 year old Duncan). Young players can handle playing games with no rest  and won't get injured as much."
Trae Young lol
"It's nearly impossible to have real flexibility as a contender. It's pointless to go win now around a 1st or 2nd year player bc they aren't good enough. Stay bad those years, might pick up some more young guys at the top of the draft who can contribute   Year 3 and 4 start getting your starters or other stars. The extension hasn't kicked in and you still have cap room. Once the extension kicks in you can still keep those guys since you can go over the cap to re-sign your star  Exactly what the Hawks did with Trae"
The less Trae Young we have to watch the better. Boring ass player.
Fade me fam. Let me sub in! I GOT this! Trae Young believes in me 😏
"""YOU KNOW, THEY SAY ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL!  BUT YOU LOOK AT ME AND YOU LOOK AT TRAE YOUNG AND YOU CAN SEE THAT STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE! SEE NORMALLY IF YOU GO ONE ON ONE WITH ANOTHER BALLER YOU GOT A 50/50 CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT I'M A GREEK FREAK, AND I'M NOT NORMAL!!"""
"The wording makes it sound like they're questioning if Trae Young **is** Clint Capela. There's like a foot difference in height, how do you mix those 2 up?"
Grant Hill and Trae Young.
"This guy gets it. For years in philly everyone kept telling me how young embiid and simmons were and they have plenty of time. I am cursed with being a lifelong basketball fan and paying attention. Only the greats are still in their prime in early 30s. Everyone else prime is generally early 20s to mid/late 20s. I kept saying they are not young. They both missed seasons and those years still count. I sent out a lot of ""i told you so's"" this playoffs. Trae Young, 2 years younger than Simmons and 5 years younger than Embiid, Booker 3 years younger than Embiid, Ayton 2 years younger than Simmons and 5 years younger than Embiid. Giannis a year younger than Embiid with 2 MVPs.  So i was right. Embiid has never conditioned properly, vanishes in the 4th quarter and gets injured easily because of it. So his body is really 30 years old. I honestly think he has maybe 2 seasons at top for left. No way he makes it past that and he has only played 294 games counting playoffs.  Simmons needed to be practicing his shot 4-5 years ago. It is too late now. He can get better for sure but by the time he does, embiid is finished being a top player. Simmons was more interested in dating kardashians than shooting basketballs. He will never get good though, he can only bring it up to subpar. Again if he had the drive to do it, he would have already.  Finally with simmons, it is way more frustrating than Embiid. He is so great at everything except he is completely atrocious at one thing. He plays in the era that one thing is the most critical skill. Shooting. It is hard to be a starting center in this league wit out a solid 3pt shot. At this point Simmons cannot even be in the game at critical times because he is a liability. How can you be a star when you have to be taken out when the game is most important? Embiid, maybe he does condition. I know the talking heads claim he does, they claimed the same about donny mac though and donny came in every year fat and they talked about how hard he conditioned. I mean, i can see his fat gut guys lol. With Embiid, it is hard to really believe he is conditioning when he has always killed it in the first half and is gassed in the 4th quarter.  Edit: Donny Mac = Donovan McNabb"
Trae Young because Embiid is a walking Embiinjury
"You can't blame Bud for Giannis getting injured.  You can blame him that the team still has 2 All Stars at their disposal and got blown out.  If they get eliminated to a Trae Young-less Hawks team, it's time for *something* drastic for the Bucks.  Bud and their HC position is the next thing on the chopping block for the Bucks to check out."
The Bucks played half ass in game 4 thinking they could waltz their way without Trae Young. I expect them to play harder.
"lol, Trae Young was putting up fantasy stats really and not getting his team involved. Now he's playing Steve Nash-isque, and I love the turn around!"
Are they both given the keys to the offense on the jump? Then Curry because he can elevate the team around him… see Trae Young where Durant is an incredible talent and scorer but he’s not seen as someone that makes his teammates better.
I literally love our entire young core. I can’t decide my favorite player after Trae. They all have fun personalities and fun games to watch
"&gt;Trae Young and Giannis and Kyrie weren’t injured because someone turned their “availability” slider down to zero.   Getting hurt put the ""availability slider"" down to zero. This isn't 2k"
It’s not. That’s just a dumb coachspeak phrase. Trae Young and Giannis and Kyrie weren’t injured because someone turned their “availability” slider down to zero.
"they were down ten when giannis went down, and that is without trae young! embarassing."
Trae young
Trae young
Trae Young redemption arc continues ...
"Wade , Lebron , Trae Young"
yeah i thought so but I remember seeing a stat saying Trae Young shot the most floaters so idk what to believe
"Trae Young, he's finally realised that putting up fantasy stats and jacking up 35 ft 3 pointers ends with him sitting at home after the regular season finishes."
well trae young is objectively not better than any of the guys on that list lol
"If Embiid never got injured again I’d take him because generational centers are so rare. But with injury issues, I’d take Trae because he’s young, healthy, and runs the offense so well."
What's it like as a fan? I started watching from the second half of game 4 and realised Trae Young wasn't on the floor and the Bucks were still down by 11 or somethign at half. How can that happen?
Trae young easier to build around and his game will age alot better.
"He hasn’t led them anywhere yet. They beat a bad Knicks team and the Sixers in a series that was 90 percent determined by what the Sixers didn’t do than what the Hawks did. Now they’re playing a Bucks team without the 2x MVP.   Trae Young has had a good playoffs. We’ll see what he does next year when the rules are different and presumably the Hawks don’t have a joke path to the finals.   Also, Anthony Davis is one of the best defenders in the NBA and Trae is arguably the worst defensive player in the entire league."
Doesn't he always call trae young a generational player? I guess when u played against Philly them choking was the bigger story
Idk I saw Trae Young has potential to be GOAT
"We ain’t talking “futbol” buddy , biggest floppers on jump shots are American , trae young , Chris Paul , harden , the list goes on"
Bill Simmons hates Trae Young. He’s gotten better recently but he was by far the most “average r/NBA user” level of critical of him for the longest
"Trae Young literally got spit on the other day. You can argue that they had to deal with worse, I’m saying what they had to deal with was different. Arenas are more secure and strict now, sure, but back then, it was a lot easier to separate from all that bullshit once the game was over. If a player wants to use social media these days, like most young people do, it’s absurdly hard to avoid all the toxicity. Hell, people film Ben practicing shooting just to make fun of Ben. That type of constant pressure in and out of games was not present as consistently back in the 90’s and 2000’s."
Trae Young has led his team to the east coast finals. In his 3rd year. What did AD do in his first seven years? He's the 2nd option on a championship team. Trae is the first and he's done this in 3 seasons.
"Here's the scary thing.  Cam Reddish is back, Bogi is back and Trae Young will most likely be back and now Giannis is out.  If Giannis is out for the rest of the series or only at 70% the Bucks might be heading for a vacation."
Trae Young is not remotely in the league of Anthony Davis lmao what are you talking about
"Because I wasn’t talking to you. Luka averages more points on the same true shooting, is a way better rebounder, and both are fantastic passers. Trae has a better team around him. Hawks were winning last night without young, Mavericks are a bottom 3 team in the league without Luka. Luka isn’t anything special on defense, but he has size and can’t be exploited like young can be. Luke averaged 36 ppg against the clippers and shot way more efficiently than Trae young has been shooting this playoffs."
"Well, let's put this into perspective.  Bogi is new, Gallo has always been a plus player.  John Collins is versatile but not dominant at any one thing.  Cam Reddish and Hunter are in their 2nd yrs.  Add to that with no national exposure and you have the current recipe of talent with no recognition.  Four weeks ago, people were laughing at Trae Young being called a star.  To put it in prospective, even Ja Morant didn't make the teams.  Young players normally don't get proper recognition."
"If anything, Trae Young is stylistically closer to a player like Harden than Dame."
"If you think that the Bucks would have been able to beat the Hawks with Giannis and without a healthy Trae Young, it’s irrelevant to the original point, which was somehow arguing that Giannis is incapable of being the best player on a championship team"
"Giannis played 4 games, so did Trae Young. Young in total played 9 minutes more than Giannis in the entire series."
My quickest thought is trae young but
Didn’t Knicks fans spit on Trae young during a pandemic? Seems like that should drop them significantly.
"the bucks lost to the hawks without trae young in game 4 with giannis  Then they won games 5 and 6 without Giannis  Giannis got injured in game 4, but the hawks were leading the whole game before that and up by 10 at the time he got injured (7 minutes left in the 3rd quarter)"
The Hawks without Trae Young are not a playoff team lol.
As a Trae Young stan I encourage this perspective lol.
"Trae over booker is whatever I think they are close enough it's tough but I won't take that against you but hunter over bridges just no, also Ayton exists so does cam who both are amazing, Ayton is a top 10 center in the league and looking like he will be a top 5 soon if he isn't already (even if center is the smallest position so its less meaningful) and cam would be a starter on basically any non playoff team (with some exceptions) and is only not starting because we have mikal bridges and crowder.  I would mention jalen but he isn't worth bringing up, also depends on if you count cam Payne as young as he is pretty young (albeit not super young) and if you count cam Payne that is another starter caliber player.  Sun's have a starter caliber team just with players under 26 and a team that could be almost a playoff team, or an actual playoff team if they all progress."
Trae Young is more like a flop-happy Steve Nash
Acting like he's Trae Young who pulls up from the logo
"Curry and Trae Young only have 3P shooting and even that’s not very close since Curry the GOAT shooter. Trae doesn’t even move off ball lmao which is a huge part of Curry’s game   Durant and BI. Ingram is tall, and that’s where it ends lol"
"Jimmer was about a Trae Young level on D, the major issue with jimmer is he wanted the ENTIRE system to be build around him like it was in college, which in the NBA doesn’t work even someone like Lebron doesn’t have every single play run for them alone"
The Trae Young-less Hawks literally beat the Bucks in game 4 when Giannis was playing
"Everyone after the 2018 draft: Look at Luka Doncic and Trae Young, man.   Mikal Bridges &amp; Deandre Ayton: Our time has come"
You right injuries only way for yall to win bc trae young made yo ass look silly 💀
not on Trae Young though :'(
"I thought he's earned all his fouls. He's a big guy and is definitely getting hacked. If a guy like Trae Young gets touched and gets the call, Giannis should get them too when he's being that aggressive."
Trae Young is trash so ya
I think he would be much more highly regarded had he not been a #1 overall draft pick (over Trae Young and Luka Doncic). He is a very solid player who will never live up to the superstar expectations a top pick has.
suns won't won't admit it but booker is just as annoying as trae young or james harden in terms of foul drawing
NBA Twitter is a cancerous place. Homie told me during the Hawks series Ray Allen is a worse shooter than Trae Young and dude wasn’t even a Hawks fan
"two reasons behind why you don't want kuzma with the ball. one of them you already mentioned, his subpar handles.  the other one, and a much bigger issue, is his decision making. he's actually capable of turning the easiest of assists into a braindead turnover because he wants to make it on the espn highlight reel. the play that stands out this season was that horrendous lob he attempted to lebron during game 6 against the suns. lebron immediately wanted out of the game afterwards. i don't blame him. that was just as dogshit a play as when ben simmons passed out of a dunk with trae young infront of him. absolutely draining mentally.  it's not even just his passing, his shot selection is questionable at best. nothing makes me cringe more than a kuz triple threat into a contested 3 or barely get by for a half contested elbow jumper/floater you can tell he rarely works on. get him worked up like mpj did during last years' wcf and watch kuz run it down to chuck a 3 in a sad attempt to get one back, on multiple possessions. i mean, it's great to have confidence in yourself to do that, but dude needs to learn to check himself and stay in his lane.  kuzma is an airhead on the court. and this part of his game has yet to improve. maybe being on the lakers has something to do with it, being under a media microscope all the damn time probably has an effect where you have this pressure to ""prove you belong.""   kuz isn't exactly efficient either. he averaged 13pts this season on 11 shots. sure he can prob average ~22ppg, just find a team willing to give him 20+ shots a game and willing to put up with his brainfarts every 10th possession."
"Alright, I admit it, Trae Young has the biggest baby nuts in the world, but they're still baby nuts"
"Oh, are you talking about Trae Young, who's been an all-star?"
You can’t go wrong with either player IMO. Your getting a polished assassin who doesn’t get rattled with elite skill at a young age in booker and your getting a walking 30-10 explosive player in ice Trae. I do think trae has a middy but doesn’t shoot them at w high volume but even if he did I agree with you it def isn’t on booker’s level which is elite. I do think Trae’s special playmaking ability at least offensively might give him a slight edge
Yep a dude the other day I was talking to thought trae young was on the sixers. Casuals are in it for the storylines and the superstars.
Holy shit Trae young isn’t as good as one of the best players and the best shooter of all time? Say it ain’t so
"Ok a lot to unpack here. I don’t care what basketball reference says Lebron is not a point guard. He may bring the ball up the court but that’s the only aspect of his game that resembles a point guard. He matches up with forwards on both offense and defense and every all-nba selection he’s ever had has been at the forward position. Again, no statistical case for CP3 whatsoever and most people agree that there was a very strong case for Dame at first team all-nba. Also, why are you using the all-nba case for CP3 but conveniently forget that Trae didn’t make one? As for Trae Young, his supporting cast was so much better than Dame. Dude went 5/23 in game 7 of the ECF against the sixers and still won because of his supporting cast. And did you watch the series against the Nuggets at all?? What else could Dame have done? Dude scored 55 points in game 5 and put up the highest playoff game score OF ALL TIME and still lost cause his teammates couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn. If you watched that series and think that Dame is the reason they couldn’t get past them you’re insane"
"Harden, Curry, Doncic, Lebron, Paul and Trae Young.  Dude isn’t even top 5."
"Remember 2019’s team ? They lost to France. Putting these young players together could mean team USA loses gold. It would be more interesting I guess. My starting lineup would be Trae , book, Tatum , MPJ, Bam. I chose Trae because of his great playmaking and shooting. MPJ at the 4 because he a good rebounder and a knock down shooter with size. Defensively they could struggle but I think book and MPJ can defend well enough especially internationally. Bam and Tatum are good defensively."
"I never put him with curry, you misunderstood what I said. I just used Curry as an example that you never know how good a player might become. And right now, there are 5 generational players imo: Lebron, KD, Curry, Trae, and Luka. Lebron, KD, and Curry are the established greats of this generation and the past and Trae and Luka are the ones for this generation and the future. Trae and Luka are in a class of their own among the young players today."
"Neither of these teams made their runs purely on the strength of their young core. It takes a mix of young guys *and* vets— for the Hawks especially, I'd say Capella and Bogdan were more important to that ECF run than anyone in their ""young core"" other than Trae (and *maybe* Collins, but he was kind of inconsistent)"
"As long as that piece isn't Trae Young, I highly doubt that."
If Trae Young didn't fracture his foot they might be in the finals right now...
You're worse lol.  1) You got taken to 7 by KD and and Joe Harris and wouldve lost if KD played barefoot.  2) You went to a game 6 versus the baby Hawks and Trae Young.  3) You're on track to getting swept by the Suns right now lol
"This is a good point. Suns young core is a lil more proven as booker has been a consistent 25 ppg scorer for the past 2 seasons and ayton has been a two way force all playoffs, and cam Johnson and bridges  are classic 3 and D  wing players every team in the nba covets.  Trae has always been super talented but truly put it all together in this post season run it was electric to watch. Hunter flashed potential 2 way star ability, Collins is inconsistent af but is an athletic floor spacer, okungwu has elite defensive potential but very raw on offense rn and cam is an frustrating enigma with loads of talent and if he can put it all together your looking at PG 2.0"
"Trae/Collins/Hunter/Reddish/Huerter/Okongwu are all 23 or younger, that's insane.  Plus Capela can be a long term piece and he's still young."
I was told Trae Young was the only player who did this.
"After this playoffs, I will say that Trae Young will be a starter. Dude was killing it before the referee fu his ankle..."
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-
I think Devin Booker might push off more than Trae Young. How does this go unnoticed?
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"I would implore you to dig more into shot types as well. Not every drive is created equal. Harden isn’t afraid of driving into a crowded paint, and he’s always looking to get off a layup (he’s recently added more of a floater game though).   For example, I believe one of those years, DeMar Derozan was near the top — that’s a guy that’s pulling up from midrange on his drives MUCH more often. Trae Young is another one who has been up there, and he uses his floater much more, thus avoiding contact and potential fouls."
Isn’t it weird that young stars like luka Trae and Zion will accumulate a billion+ solely based on nba contracts?
You should see Trae young. Every other dribble he looks at the ref and begs for a foul. Turns the ball over? Stands around during transition to stare at the ref and cry.
"steph curry has never shot below 40% from 3 point over a full season, trae has never shot above 36%  steph came into the league as an elite 3 point shooter. trae young despite his fast release has never shot even league average from 3 point range, he's a below average shooter.  34% this year, league average was 36%.  Stephs worst shooting season is 5 percent better than trae's best season.   Also trae shot 31% in the playoffs"
"https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/free-throws-attempted  Trae is #4 with the top 3 being the most arguably dominant low post players, which would make sense that down low with switch defense and dominance that all 3 would get that high volume of Free throws  u can't tell me Trae young gets to the rim at that volume to deserve that number of fouls, he is getting those same calls at the 3 point line at the same volume, thats an anomaly.   + fouls on perimeter players means that they can't play as much defense on your perimeter player, which leads to more 3's and perimeter play which is the rising trend in the NBA  + fouls on a post player can come from any random source, or just an extra body on the post which doesn't negatively affect the opponents team when foul baiting except for the situation where u have a 6 foul ejection on the opposite teams only matchup for the big, which never happens to NOP, MIL, or PHI because refs call smaller players contact way more than larger players  trae foul baiting on refs saved that ATL series, dont lie to urself bud lol"
"If he was on a shit team with a coach who’s sole purpose was to make sure Kuz gets 25 ppg, sure. But shit teams aren’t letting a player like Kuzma chuck it just for the sake of hitting a quota. A lot of those shots would be going to young players the team is trying to develop. Even if you look at shit teams from this year and last the only players averaging close to 25 ppg are current or potential franchise cornerstones (KAT, Lavine, Zion, Ingram, Trae last year etc.)"
"I initially had it as 'shit' instead of 'mediocre'; but tbh, Kuzma isn't that bad. He's just ..... average.  I think he's just watching a lot of young stars like Luka, Tatum, Booker, Trae, etc.... and saying ""I can be that!"".  No."
Randle and Trae Young
Meanwhile DBook drove and was breathed on and he got a call.. that one killed me. When he trae young flopped.
"DBook was on that trae young flop  shit, it was embarrassing and the refs fell for it"
"Khris Middleton, with the defender being Trae Young wearing a Celtics jersey"
Trae Young might regress to Trae Old
Bro I literally said Trae young is guarding him in both of my responses 😭
Clamp god Trae young locking kd shit up in the clutch
Kevin Durant and Trae young to guard him
"They’ll draft/sign guys that fit with SGA (probably a C), maybe sign a vet pg to mentor him (or keep Kemba) and yea, he’ll play more games. You don’t need to be on a winning team to develop, see guys like trae young and d’aaron fox. Ofc his full potential won’t be realized until the team is actually good, but SGA still has plenty of room to grow before okc wants to go into win mode. You’re really harping on okc being trash, which i agree with, but I don’t see how that’s “stunting” shai’s growth."
"Trae Young    DeMarcus Cousins    Rudy Gay    Kevin Love    Ramon Sessions"
Oh boohoo. The Nets *only* had KD and 50% of James Harden. Then the Hawks *only* had Trae Young for as many games as the Bucks had Giannis. It’s not like every injury that occurred this year happened only to teams the Bucks played during the playoffs.
I still don't think Trae Young can be the best player on a contending team during a non-cursed postseason
"Theres a part of me that hopes Trae young goes on to have a goat career, love the guy"
All of MSG was chanting fuck Trae Young and he went out and balled. He embraced that hostility and for that he has earned my respect and has grown to become one of my favorite players.
"Contenders? Any superstar, most all star players   Favorites? It would take more then one player, depth would be the key thing to add along with probably any superstar, and maybe a few stars (depending on who you count as a superstar, if you don’t count Luka and Dame they probably fall here along with guys like Trae Young or CP3). But yeah, for favorites we would need X player along with depth."
"farmar thompson and bibby are not as ""great"" as u may believe lol look at their fathers. Also if u think they are ""great"" then j kidd, trae young, blake griffin and a few others gotta be names that should be on this list as well. Hell, anyone who is half ""great"" should in all fairness be put on this list based upon who is listed lol"
Anybody can shoot around and get hot. It’s way different to play with 4 other guys on the court and still be able to shine. Most young guys hearts start beatin too quick in game and they get tense and nervous. The old guy are silky smooth. There will always be exceptions like future trae and young curry
 Honestly u might be right .  Trae young is much more appealable to the west than a guy like gianiss or jokic.  Devin booker might be the next one
Or Trae Young with his teardrop/lob threat on every drive. Absolute killer against the Sixers.
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"The fake ring shit has to stop. I’ve been a fan for 30 years, and I’m glad there’s an “unlikely” matchup. Shit gets old.  Also, not sure how a 2&amp;3 seed is some crazy finals matchup. The young guys who made it far, like Trae, are going to elevate the game for years. Got the hard part out of the way early."
"Don’t waste your time, bucks fanbase became absolute fuckin cry babies after 1 game and r/nba been hating on us more and more the further we’ve gone in the playoffs, saying Booker or cp3 flopped more or worse than trae young is one of the most laughably false statements I’ve ever seen and yet it’s getting upvoted because of the giant circlejerk going on here."
Trae Young was an all star in the 19-20 season.  I would say he’s closer to top 30 than you would think for that year.
"I would say since this is hypothetically the 19-20 season and most people didn’t have him in their top 30...Trae young would have the heat in a much better position to win  Other picks: FVV, Fox, Mitchell, CJ or Lowry"
"Uhh I think most fans think these playoffs suck. Watching the Suns sweep the Murrayless Nuggets was really fun. The Clippers without Kawhi was really fun. Watching Harden limp around was great. Not seeing Kyrie was great. The Celtics without Jalen Brown was awesome. Trae Young and Giannis getting hurt was very fun. *Embiid limping around, Danny Green getting hurt, Lebron on a bum ankle, AD going down, Chris Paul getting Covid- all awesome times."
Its not what Trae young does. Trae young takes it a step further and jumps backwards into the defender.
na trae young is charles barkley
Lol but if Trae Young did this… whole sub would be crying
And Trae Young does not.
"Exactly, Trae young does the same move and its counted as cheap, CP3 does it, and its a great play."
Isn't there going to be a rule change next year to keep people like Trae young from foul baiting like a bitch?
"Selling a foul is entirely different than foul baiting which is also different than foul creating. Booker creates fouls which is a skill, cp over sells and it looks ridiculous sometimes when he flops- the cousins elbow is a good example he did actually throw an elbow and you can’t do that but Paul made sure everyone saw it and it got reviewed.  but players like harden foul bait and actually are intentionally creating contact, trae young does the same thing. You shouldn’t be able to jump into a standing still defender and get a foul That’s what needs to be fixed and removed"
"I don't think rigged, or Adam Silver making a call or conspiracy stuff like that - I think it was just a regular case of human fallibility. I think I'm also a little frustrated by it because a lot of the calls in the Brooklyn series, especially Game 7, were *extremely* frustrating. Despite scoring from the restricted area more than any other team that got past the first round, we've been bottom on FTA per FGA by a reasonable amount counting all the playoff teams. Middleton is about the only player willing to flop for the calls, so when after playing series against Jimmy Butler, KD/Harden, Trae Young and now CP3, when he doesn't get those whistles it's maddening."
Just because Pop is a great coach doesnt mean he's infallible.  It doesnt take a genius to realize Trae Young and Bam &gt; Derrick White and Plumlee
"Woah I don't mean trade Trae Young, I mean trade other players to pair another star caliber player with Trae Young (similar to how they paired Chris Paul with Booker) if that's what you're referencing.   But yeah for like the Raptors trading DeMar for Kawhi, if they didn't win the chip or at least make the finals that move would have been very criticized"
"buddy i don't know what to tell you, but basketball is a sport which means that athletic ability is rewarded.  if someone can sprint past a player and stop on a dime, they are to be rewarded for it, not spurned.  trae young has the athletic ability to beat bigger players and then stop in an instant, and if someone fouls him, that's not his fault."
Trae young and zion. God when Zion rubbed the hawks podium before the lottery….
"This is one of the ideal ways to rebuild  -Trade assets (Bledsoe, Dragic, Ariza etc.)  -Find a franchise player to keep around and be the leader (Booker)   -Develop young guys to either be trade pieces or keep (TJ warren, Kelly Oubre, etc)  -Get lucky with a high draft pick to add to your young core (Ayton, Mikal)   -Further develop players, build a team culture, boost their confidence, and start winning games (Booker, Oubre, Ayton, Monty, Mikal, and then the Bubble)   -Sign veterans (Payne, Crowder, Frank, etc) and if your franchise player isn't enough to take the next step, trade for another star to pair with them (Chris Paul) to be a competitive playoff team   Similar to the Warriors rebuild, except that Steph was good enough where they didn't have to trade for another star w/Klay and Draymond. I expect the Hawks to do something similar with Trae Young within the next couple years to take the next step"
"Just because Lebron is still so popular, they'll switch names. KD is so easy to villify for example, but also talk up his greatness.  Then there's Luka and Zion, they have their things they can focus on to either hype them up or tear them down. Jokic and Giannis are a bit more difficult as they don't have too much drama around them, maybe Giannis for his FT/Shooting. Then you have Lamelo Ball or Trae Young, who they can always say they need to do more or whatever that means.  Plenty of options."
Ben “cant dunk on fucking Trae Young” Simmons scored 42 with Gobert defending the paint. Imagine that.
"He’s even allowed to stop.  Right now, reversing (the Trae young play) is allowed but it’s being taken out of the game, but pace changes or even stopping on a dime is still going to be allowed"
Did he adjust to it or did Trae Young get hurt
"This move will be an offensive foul next season, per the NBA. This is exactly what Trae Young does. Slows down in front of a chasing defender to get them to run into his butt."
"This move will be an offensive foul next season, per the NBA. This is exactly what Trae Young does. Slows down in front of a chasing defender to get them to run into his butt."
they got mad because trae young did it for half a season and torched everyone
We just came out of a 6 game series against Trae Young and I’ve never seen such blatant foul seeking. It was egregious tonight.
"This is why people who used to shit on Trae Young for being a bad defender are idiots. It certainly helps if you’re an average or good defender as a pg, but relative to the offensive output in scoring and playmaking of an elite PG, it doesn’t matter nearly as much as having a 5 who is a bad defender since a huge part of the role is rim protection.  A point guard’s main responsibility is to create and score, if they can do they at an elite level, that is way more valuable to the team even if they can be attacked on the defensive end. Offense is more valuable than defense in this game."
Giannis isn't scared to dunk on Trae Young
Trae Young and a good hair transplant surgeon
"The trouble is he's a super-rough trade asset at the moment.  A dude who can't shoot and won't shoot who's sub-40 on FT% and afraid to dunk on Trae Young is kind of a liability and one on one D does not make up for that.  All that, and he's on a max contract?  But Philly probably think they should get an All-Star and picks for him?  I don't see it happening."
Trae Young apparently.
"Sexton would be a nice replacement for Beal's spot now that he's out, imo, idk why that dude gets hate but he could do well in a similar role as Beal. He's a walking bucket, great shooter and great off-ball.   MPJ, John Collins, and JJJ would be good good replacements for Jerami Grant now that he's out. I'd also take any of those guys over Kevin Love right now.  I'm assuming you forgot Ja, but he's another great young PG who could play instead of Trae if he were to be injured or not play. Maybe not the same level of playmaker Trae is, but he's still a good passer and altogether dynamic player.  IMO, I think Team USA could've definitely used a classic 7 footer type center to matchup size if needed over Kevin Love, and Jarrett Allen is probably the best USA product to fit that mold right now. Bam is good but he's more of a skilled small ball 5 and hybrid 4, fits a different profile. Draymond as well, he's a point forward PF ideally."
Ja and trae wouldn't help. They already have gaurds that are objectively better players. In international play trae is gonna get killed on defense. And trae is a a huge foul battery he won't get those calls.   Ja doesn't fox the issues team Isa has either they should be taken a young center.
"Why Tf is Klove even on the roster? We got dudes like Trae, Zion and Ja. Literally the 3 best young prospects in this league as well as Luka and none of them got the call.  It’s also funny how people shitting on Ja saying he won’t be an amazing player and he bounced a blazing hot Curry out of the playoffs by consecutively scoring the last 8 points as well as the game winner in an elimination game."
"Lloyd Pierce was hired by Pop and Carlisle because he's a big voice in the coaches union, especially with helping these old white coaches wrap their heads around diversity issues. Remember when Lloyd Pierce was fired, and Pop and Carlisle scorned the Hawks organization for firing him? Pop went as far as to say [the Hawks would ""regret firing him""](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/gregg_popovich_hawks_will_regret_firing_lloyd_pierce/s1_16514_34245380) and the rest of the coaches in the NBA fell in line with the message. Lloyd Pierce has a lot of pull with the fraternity of NBA Coaches, which is also why he was able to get the coaches to not vote Trae Young into the all-star game."
"You are the only person here who has made a reasonable prediction. I think those are my top 4. My other 3 are Tatum, Trae Young and Embiid. Embiid barring injuries is clearly top 5"
"It's in other comments on this thread but to summarize- didn't take Trae's or other team leaders opinions into consideration, bullied young players like Reddish, created a hostile environment, advocated for Trae to not be an All Star said he hadn't earned the Olympics, was a terrible coach who got fired with one of the worst records in the league and then the team became a top 4 team with no other changes."
"But still. Bradley Beal is out, they lost a guard. Trae Young just torched the Eastern conference, and no invite still?"
How is this guy over Trae Young?
"surely they didnt skip out on trae young???? this team sucks lol, wtrf"
We don’t need Trae Young blowing shots because he expects to go to the line 15 times a game. We’re doing that plenty already.
"I fucking love Trae Young. Yes young man, that’s another chip on your shoulder. I can’t wait for this dude to obliterate teams next year."
I don’t but it doesn’t really seem that hard to get a rise out of you tbh.  Seems like even implying Trae Young is a good playmaker gets you really riled up lol
Bruh duncan robinson but no trae young smh its like they want another country to win this year
Honestly either denim booker or Trae young
How does team USA include Derrick White and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant and Trae Young?
Trae Young is not FIBA material. his foul baiting tactics will not work in the international game.
(For worse)  The idea that Trae Young or Ja Morant couldn't help this team more than Zach Lavine and Kevin Love is just insane to me.
"It's crazy that the team only has one pointguard with some of the talent left off the roster. The could absolutely use Trae Young, in fact I think that's the skillset that they're lacking."
"Bruh have you seen trae young play before? Again (very talented, very skilled player) but he’s one of the physically weakest guys in the league and hunts for fouls. Harden and luka are both slashers, trae has a good layup package and floaters. Granted I think he’d make a decent amount of 3’s and he’d get some buckets, but he’d get killed on d."
"Trae Young would get eaten alive in FIBA?  You haters have stepped over into the realm of the idiotic now.  Its gone beyond hot takes.  Its just stupid, dumb ass opinions now."
"Would Trae Young be effective though? considering he was injured, very inconsistent, an offense that rely on drawing FT(something fifa don't like that much), and a hole in the defense."
Luv trae young
Is the team about accomplishments or the beat players? Because if it’s about accomplishment Andre Iguadola should be on there.   But clearly it’s about politics not about who is the best and that’s what the young guys are mad at. Ja and Trae are better than anyone in the select team and there are over 10+ vet players that are better than Kevin Love. Why didn’t they get picked? I didn’t see any tweets from them?
"Nope, but as long as the NBA allows players to flop and get calls it’s a very effective way to score. Players like Harden and Trae Young as so damn effective because of this. Why would they stop? Until the NBA fixes this/ makes changes to the refs who are ruining the game right now, players have no reason to not foul chase. It’s how you win in the NBA right now."
"Idk, I'm definitely feeling where OP is coming from there, even if obviously from the opposite side - this playoff run has probably taken a solid 5 or so years off my life already, and that's *without* a winner take all game 7. Just off the top of my head, we've had:  * game 1 against the Heat go down to the wire in OT  * going down 0-2 against the Nets  * blowing game 5 against the KD show  * somehow pulling out a game 7 win by the tip of KD's shoe  * Trae Young picking up where KD left off in game 1  * losing Giannis to a devastating-looking injury in a tied series  * Khris and Jrue leading us home from said tied series to fulfill the prophecy  * And now us bringing the series back to 2-2  Don't get me wrong, I'll 100% take being where we're at even with all the bumps in the road we've had to get here, and I'd prefer a game 7 over a Suns in 6, but goddamn has this been a stressful fucking 2 months since the playoffs started."
"gotchu fam [https://theathletic.com/2421465/2021/03/02/behind-the-scenes-failed-lloyd-pierce-era-why-atlanta-hawks-eager-for-new-voice/](https://theathletic.com/2421465/2021/03/02/behind-the-scenes-failed-lloyd-pierce-era-why-atlanta-hawks-eager-for-new-voice/)  tl;dr Lloyd Pierce negged the entire team into sucking ass. He's a ""player's coach"" that bullied Cam Reddish and consistently played down Trae Young both in person and in public. I've personally experienced this type of ""coaching"" before and unless you're all psycho Kobe types it's absolute pure cancer. It's baffling he's on team USA and in a just world anything less than a gold would send this clown down to AAU"
"Trae Young had a 32% usage rate to Lillard's 31%.  They both dominate the ball at similar top 10 rates.  It's nothing against Lillard, I just think Trae Young is an elite playmaker."
"Personally, I'm not investing money into like a Trae Young jersey even though I absolutely love him. I only have a Giannis jersey and a Khris Middleton FIBA Jersey"
Can't believe USAB chose Lloyd Pierce over Trae Young.
Trae young would average 5 points &amp; be ejected for screaming in the ref’s face in 5 minutes. He isn’t built to handle FIBA basketball lmao
"Lmao Dame averaged 10 assists in the 6 games he got to play  No other regular season or postseason comes close to that mark  Dame is a god tier scorer and creates a ton of looks because of his gravity but Trae Young is objectively a better playmaker, like by far"
Trae Young surrounded by Team USA
I see where he’s coming from tho Trae is a rising young star and the Olympics require veteran players
"Please someone from the Hawks PR call Trae immediatly and tell him not to make a bigger deal out of it. The IT situation was different, other players don't despise Trae and make it their goal to not have him on the team. He is an amazing young player and will get to Olympia later in his career and it will be a great experience with full stands then.  Really no need to needle the decision makers, nothing good will come out of it."
"Very hot take but I think if we got the iteration of players we could potentially have in the US, meaning all the top stars played say in Rio and now in Tokyo, they would surpass the dream team and redeem team (2012 team was prettt fuxking good too).  Off the top: Lebron, KD, Westbrook, Kyrie, Dame, Klay, Steph, Harden, Kawhi, PG, Butler, K Love, Booker, Beal, Zion, Trae Young, Ja, etc...  Almost any permutation of that team would be otherworldly.  I'd personally go Westbrook, Klay, Bron, KD, Kawhi. 2 guard 3 forward lineup."
Truly it comes down to Jarrett Allen vs Trae Young and I personally think that Trae Young would be a perfect fit.
"Ben Simmons is basically the textbook example of recency bias. Most people on this sub see him as a sub-40% free throw shooter who never dunks and is deathly afraid of Trae Young.   People only bring up averages when it suits them, and when it doesn't they just act like the last however many games is who the player is."
"Hawks won’t match a max on Collins.  No way.  That’s not as easily tradable as you suggest.   A max would be offered under the assumption he’s going to get better. Let’s say he plateaus - which isn’t crazy - well then you’ve got nobody else interested and you’re stuck with a bad contract.   This is the Otto Porter scenario - and the Hawks really don’t need that. They have Trae and Hunter about to take up two max slots. And a bunch of other young guys that could blossom. They’ll hate to see Collins walk for nothing, but a max is super high risk and low reward."
"The bad boy pistons had basically created a blood feud with the rest of the league, to the point none of the other dream team members would want to play with Isaiah Thomas. It's a pretty disingenuous comparison to make considering it comes down to Trae Young vs Lloyd Pierce in this case, and I for one think Pierce deserves to be in consideration for WOAT NBA coach, and not Trae Young vs all 11 other players on the team"
Trae Young is better than every guard on that team that isnt Dame
"The victim complex is that you're saying your player is getting a lot of hate, but Trae fucking Young of all people is beloved?"
"They sort of need someone like Ja, though.  Or Trae Young.  Or even Donovan Mitchell, or as Bill Simmons said, LaMelo.  Right now they don't have a real playmaker.  They have a bunch of scorers, and some ""zero guards"" (Lilliard or Jrue), but nobody that can really run the court.  This is why they might not win this year."
Derrick white &gt; trae young
Seeing Trae young play without foul calls would definitely be… interesting.
With Trae Young as the rim defender!
what does derrick white bring that trae young wouldn't? defense I guess
"&gt; Someone like Ja or Trae Young should be on the team, or another big man.  How about a defender who can facilitate"
"Time to call LeBron, PG, Trae Young or Zion..."
Should be Trae or ja. Need a young playmaker.
It seems like they didn't hit up any of the young guys. Trae and Zion weren't invited either to my knowledge.
Would still get 1v1'd by Trae 'Cole' Young
"Mark Jackson be like   “And if I’m Devin booker, I’m a super star.”  “And if I’m trae Young, I’m a super star.”  “And if I’m Donovan Mitchell, I’m a super star.”"
"LP was notoriously shitty to Trae as the Hawks HC, he even pushed for him not being voted to the all star team by coaches this year.   Pop no real evidence, outside of for the qualifiers that America sucked ass in Pop went with Derrick White over Trae Young. But I sorta get that. Trae was going into his second season and White was a spur. But it looks terrible now when passing and scoring was a huge issue with that team leading to the worse finish for America."
"There's no space for that on a broadcast show, just literally no time unless it's Inside the NBA, and they do it pretty well. On a podcast it should as long as the host doesn't have a massive ego about their opinion.  With Simmons it depends on the opinion lol. Like he flipped hard on Trae Young over the course of the playoffs and he explained it really well why he flipped. But his undying hatred of Jerami Grant has been bewildering, dude's not an allstar but Simmons said he'd rather have Huerter than Grant. like come on, just admit you were wrong when you said it was a horrible contract/decision to leave Denver lol. But that won't come until Grant's doing this on a winning team, which is all that Bill cares about and to a certain extent I do agree with that idea that scoring a ton while losing a ton is overrated in today's discourse."
"Different Era. 25ppg back then is as good if not better than 30ppg now, especially on the efficiency Dirk had. I mean, look at how many good, but not quite great guards put up ~25 ppg this season: Collin Sexton, Deaaron Fox, SGA, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, etc.  Those numbers were a rarity back in the day only the best of the best could reach"
Trae Young and John Collins time since they need a PG and PF
I’m sure if they asked Trae young to play he would play regardless
…bruh just pick up Trae Young and be done with it.
"Understandable coming from Reggie though, he sees a bit of himself in Trae Young after the kid became the Knicks public enemy # 1 that series."
Subs in TRAE YOUNG!
Now they saying kd needs trae young to beat Nigeria
Call up trae young but milk dud head Lloyd pierce is prolly still in his feelings
"Someone like Ja or Trae Young should be on the team, or another big man."
Westbrook or Ja Morant would be my picks.  There’s zero chance Trae Young makes it with Lloyd Pierce on the coaching staff
Trae Young or Myles Turner or Randle or someone like that
trae young solves their problems
I’m gonna get downvoted for this but that’s been the reason I think Trae young is better than booker is because booker might be a slightly better scorer and defender but Trae is 4x the passer and that’s just so valuable to a team.
They're the type of people that called Trae Young a bust a month into his rookie season.
I think it’s more the foul baiting that he doesn’t do that keeps him from being considered elite- which is wild to think about. Harden or trae young could easily have a 6/20 shooting night like Middleton does but they add in 11-12 free throws or something to still get 25 points where as Middleton never gets to the line and never gets foul calls
"It’s a subtle change, but if you’ve ever gone up for a layup you know it doesn’t take much to throw off your rhythm/cause a miss. And PJ’s arm extends. In my opinion it’s a foul. I remember everybody got upset about a similar call that Trae Young got in the last game of that series. Both are fouls, but it’s also the kind of thing that happens all the time and are usually missed, and I’m also fine with refs letting it go if the guy makes it or whatever.   Definitely didn’t decide the game or anything, and as a neutral I don’t even care that much, but I don’t blame Booker for being upset about it and just think the “he’s a flopping whiner” narrative is way overblown, especially considering the way most stars in the nba act."
"IIRC he pretty explicitly said that Trae Young would be a good reminder to not write off players too early. Basically Bill admitting he proclaimed “good stats, bad team” too early"
"The villain status comes from his cockiness/swagger (which is hilarious and great imo)  He’ll shush the crowd after winning the game on a floater, smirk at them when they’re chanting “Fuck Trae Young”, shimmy right before nailing a 3 pointer. He thrives off of negative energy and revels in it."
"I, being more exposed to his bullshit now, will obviously dislike him more after learning more about him, same shit with trae young. I’ve never had respect for this type of shooter.   It’s not that we hate him more because it’s the playoffs, we hate him more because we know more about him."
So would Trae Young and James Harden
Trae young only got love? Come on.
Trae young
Half the players or so were drafted pre 2015 where the game was imo much differemt even though people have been complaining about fouls since way before.  They dealt with it then and they can do it now. just a year or so adjustment period. Players like Trae would suffer the most since they are so young and relient on it.
"The NBA is actually thinking about enforcing new rules to stop the weird fouls players keep drawing (look up ""NBA new rule to stop trae young"" On YouTube, if you want to know more)."
"Yah, if I haven’t picked a side after 4 out of 7 games I really don’t care who wins I just want 7 games.  I think CP3, Booker and Ayton getting a ring is an extremely impactful story for the league.  CP3 getting one after so many people thought he had the worst contract in the league. After being traded over and over again. After all his injuries at the worst time.  Not gonna lie, if he does win, and 20 years pass and I have some youngins trying to say he was on the LeBron level…. I’m gonna remind them how his antics cost him games, how he would try to do too much stuff you lose looking at highlights and box scores.   But still, winning a title, in this era playing the way he does? It could reinvigorate the PG role and position. Maybe Trae spends the next 4 years trying to be a better game manager and defender rather than scoring more.  Booker and Ayton also have the storyline of being the rebirth of Shaq and Kobe. They are both so young and doing so much it’s crazy.   As much as CP3 is getting credit, I have Booker than Ayton, then CP3 in my FMVP for the Suns.  Then we have the Bucks…   Giannis getting MVP, DPOY, every award you can get besides ROY and then cementing that with his first ring at only 26? While not having the kind of help that every team since 2011 has had.  This transitional era when the older guard is potentially dropping off and the new is taking over starts with an incredible player something we haven’t really seen before in Giannis.   And then the rest of the Bucks… Lopez, Middleton, Holiday, Tucker, even Pat Connaughton all vets who know how rare a chance at a ring like this gets."
"Not so great when he's shoving dudes in the air cause he's upset.  An actual good villain is Trae young. Talks mad shit and taunts the crowd, but never does anything stupid/dangerous. And doesn't  throw tantrums like a child"
This is such revisionist history. Or does trae young not flop and foul bait anymore?
"Dude people were yelling fuck Trae Young outside Barclays Center after a Nets Bucks game lol, the entirety of NYC hated the dude."
"I respect Trae Young, amazing young player. Booker can go suck Kendall off he is the worst!"
"Obviously, in general, better players get more All-Star selections, but rating borderline All-Stars such as Ben Simmons on total All-Star appearances is one of the lazier ways to evaluate players.  First All-Star selections are a half-season award. Second, if you just use All-Stars as a way to measure players like 20 years after the fact by just looking at All-Star appearances, you would think Ben Simmons had a much better year this year than Trae Young or Khris Middleton (both weren’t All-Stars). But we know that actually isn’t the case. It’s because there’s so much variation in borderline All-Stars that they don’t mean that much. You can easily argue in all 3 of Ben’s All-Star years he shouldn’t have made it if the All-Star game was held at the end of the year."
Diva and villain are two different things. Trae young is a villain. Booker is a diva
Trae Young played the “villain” perfect this year. Booker is just a bitch l
Coaches picked Ben Simmons into the all star game over trae young Im not gonna trust them lol
"&gt;Trae young who only got love his entire playoff run  lmao not in our sub. Trae was bitching, flopping, and foul baiting the whole series."
"After every playoff loss r/nba has been filled with booker slander. Started with the Schroeder shove in round 1 which started the whole “the suns are dirty team” idea. I’m not saying Booker is one of the most hated dudes in the league, but he also isn’t like Trae young who only got love his entire playoff run. It’s been fairly common for guys to hate after the Kobe comparisons and cause booker talks to the refs the whole game."
"Yup, I think that's why in the future, when more spotlight is shone on Booker, people will definitely hate him more than they will hate Trae Young."
1. Curry 2. KD 3. Trae Young 4. Beal 5. Middleton in Milwaukee  No particular order
"i hope it’s not a continued trend with the next gen of superstars in the league to constantly bitch to the refs. so far three of the biggest young breakout stars in the league (Booker, Trae and Luka) are absolutely awful about this"
I wanna hear Trae Young talk. If you close your eyes it’s a 7 year old.
"It's pretty wild to see how Trae Young gets treated by general NBA fans... having watched Harden, Trae, and Booker in consecutive series (brutal), Booker has honestly been the worst. Trae was just really good and got a kind-of friendly whistle but he at least played the game.  EDIT: Not to say Book hasn't been good, he has, but he's been so annoying to watch"
"Trae ""not even an all-star"" Young"
"Jae ""James ""Trae Young"" Harden"" Crowder"
Booker is in his Trae young bag tonight
Either Giannis has Asthma or Budenholzer saw the pristine management of Trae Young by McMillan and is overthinking it like a doofus
Pulling for Trae Young even though Lloyd Pierce will probably blackball him.
